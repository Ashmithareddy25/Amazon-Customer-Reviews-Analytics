B000002J1H|5.0|There's a fine line that separates enthusiastic followers of a band from the hardcore fans. Often, crossing that line involves taking a chance on a lesser known work. I had been a fan of Yes since 1982, but it wasn't until I rediscovered \\"Going for the One\\" eight years later that I joined the diehards. <br /> <br />Of course, I was already familiar with their classic works - \\"The Yes Album,\\" \\"Fragile,\\" \\"Close to the Edge.\\" I had seen Yes twice on the \\"Big Generator\\" tour and had even attended a couple of conventions. But nothing prepared me for the epiphany I would experience upon listening to \\"Going for the One.\\" <br /> <br />The title track's bluesy guitar blast opens the record, signaling that this will be a very different Yes album. Jon Anderson's self-effacing lyrics (\\"It's so hard to find in my cosmic mind\\") directly rebut criticism that Yes' music had become too pompous. While the title track most overtly signals Yes's new direction, the gentle \\"Turn of the Century\\" does so more discreetly. Yes builds this exquisite song to a moving climax without employing drums or synthesizers; in fact, drummer Alan White plays tuned percussion and is listed as a co-writer.  If \\"Parallels,\\" a pipe organ-driven rocker vaguely reminiscent of \\"Yours Is No Disgrace,\\" hews the closest to the classic Yes sound, it does so more succinctly than past efforts, clocking in at under 6 minutes instead of the usual 9 or 10. Yes has metaphorically entered a parallel universe, unencumbered by past successes, critical barbs or fan expectations. <br /> <br />\\"Wonderous Stories,\\" which begins the record's second half, captures Anderson's flair for tales of fantasy. It may seem anti-climactic after the similarly textured \\"Turn of the Century,\\" but its brevity makes it an effective prelude for the grand finale, \\"Awaken.\\"  This 15-minute epic runs the gamut of musical textures: from a solo piano intro to full 5-piece rock, then to an ambient, minimalist middle section, back to full band in a majestic, extended crescendo, and finally to a gentle, dreamy coda. The individual movements segue from one to another seamlessly, representing a perfection of the long form Yes pioneered on works like \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans.\\"  Jon Anderson considers this his own favorite Yes song, and with the possible exception of \\"And You And I,\\" I'm inclined to agree. <br /> <br />So what took me so long to discover \\"Going for the One?\\" Maybe I was deterred by the lack of Roger Dean cover art; I'm not sure.  In any case, my belated interest was well timed. The next year, eight members of Yes joined forces for the \\"Union\\" tour, with the centerpiece of their concert being none other than \\"Awaken.\\"  I had jumped on the diehards' bandwagon just in time to fully appreciate Yes' own rediscovery of their sleeper masterpiece.
B000BNI90O|5.0|First of all, let me share a strong feeling with you that I have right now: frankly, I'm a little intimidated by the thought of writing a review about this Soundtrack Box. That is not only because the music is so utterly beautiful that words can't describe its impact, it's first and foremost the complexity and the background of this score. I just don't know where to begin. I've written about Williams, I've reviewed Star Wars, but this one tops them all. <br />Maybe I should just start with a little background information on the scoring process of \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\". <br /> <br />In early 2000, director Peter Jackson tried to pick the right composer for his adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings.  <br />He was looking for a man who had the time and who was able and willing to summon enough energy and enthusiasm to get involved with the scoring of an epic trilogy. The dark elegance of Howard Shore's earlier works like \\"Crash\\" or \\"The Fly\\" swept Jackson away, and what was even more important: Shore works in a very operatic style and that's just what Jackson was looking for. So, Peter Jackson called him up and invited him over to New Zealand to visit the sets. Shore, after realising the scope of the project, immediately agreed to take on this task.  <br />From that point on, he worked on Fellowship, not only by writing themes, but also, and maybe especially, by studying Tolkien's themes and other Ring mythologies. \\"While writing the score, Tolkien's book was always open on my desk\\" says Shore, and the more he learned about not only Tolkien, but the historical and mythological background, the more he fell in love with it. Consequently, this score, as well as the following two, go far beyond the normal scoring duties you find in stores en masse. They are a labour of love, captivating, enchanting, rich in thematic detail, brilliant in development and execution, one grand piece of musical art, architecture and beauty equaled by nothing. <br />Howard Shore tookon the monstrous task of conceptualising an 11 hour opera, separated into three movements, and he pulled it off! <br /> <br />Fellowship of the Ring is first and above all about hobbits, especially Frodo, the fellowship of the ring and the breaking of it, caused by the Ring itself. And that's how the score is thematically centered and interwoven. <br />Dozens of interrelated leitmotifs are perfectly able to tell the story on their own, without any help from visuals. But it's not only the themes, it's literally the architecture of the music that brings different cultures to life; the dwarves for instance not only get their own, very specific choral voice, but also very symmetric harmonies. Later in the film, as the Balrog approaches, these harmonies get disturbed and mutilated by dissonances more and more, until the Balrog gets its own musical gesture. <br />Often people complain that Shore's Lord of the Rings is often compared to Wagner's Nibelungen saga. And obviously, Lord of the Rings is not 100% opera, it's still a film score, and sure enough it's Howard Shore's own voice, but it's the way the leitmotifs are treated and developed that makes LotR and Die Nibelungen very similar. <br />And that Shore is not exactly a friend of mickey- mousing certainly is helpful, too. The music is a mirror image of the things we see on the screen, and yet it never becomes merely \\"supportive\\" music. So much in Lord of the Rings is just wordless scenes, imagery, looks, so the music very often takes center stage. With its architecture and choral poems it gives the scenes a meaning, a deeper context; it moves them along, ties them together. It doesn't only connect scenes, but also all three films. <br /> <br />This gem comes in a hardboard box which is not much bigger than a standard jewel case, only much thicker. It comprises three audio CDs with the complete score in a separate, wonderfully designed folder and a bonus DVD with the full score in Dolby Surround Sound. The accompanying booklet is in my opinion the crowning jewel of this boxed set. On 45 pages, Shore- expert Douglas Adams explains all the thematic material and orchestral fine- tunes, what it describes, how it evolves and what Howard Shore himself says about it. There are also printed score excerpts, as well as descriptions of all the specific instruments that brought the cultures of Middle- Earth to life. There are even a couple of pages about the performers. <br /> <br />Concerning the quality of the music, the perfect presentation and the gorgeous box itself, the price of 50 bucks is definitely not too high. Every soundtrack collector should have this jewel on his shelve, since this is the biggest, most comprehensive score release ever, until The Two Towers comes out in mid- 2006. <br /> <br />And bear in mind: this is only the beginning of the adventure!
0783114222|5.0|This series of DVDs is my favorite. It is informative, inspirational, moving, and infinitely re-watchable. The best all around DVD investment I have made.  <br /> <br />The series captures much of the same feel as The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, especially in terms of the human dynamic between the astronauts, mission control, and others. But the scope is much boarder (all Apollo missions), and the series can explore more nuances. For instance, Alan Sheppard dealing with his inner ear infection, the dynamic in the Apollo 11 crew in terms of who would step on the surface first, and the emotional roller coaster experienced by the wives. <br /> <br />My favorite episode is Spider, about the development of the Lunar Module (LEM) by the engineers at Grumman. You don't have to be an engineer to be moved by this story. I re-watched it last night and my wife cried at the end.  <br /> <br />Some of the episodes are \\"straight forward,\\" depictions of the challenges of the astronauts. Of course, there was nothing straight forward about these missions. In fact, one of my take-aways was a better awareness of how daunting some of the missions were, and how often something small would go wrong that could have become huge in no time if not resolved.  <br /> <br />Many of the episodes capture a concept surrounding the cultural challenges of going to the moon and the state of society in general. Clearly due to the fact that Apollo 13 the movie preceded this series, in that episode they focus on the advent of sensational and intrusive journalism. First Wives Clubs look at the challenges of being the wife of an Astronaut, from the loss of life to the changing morals of the period. Other episodes juxtapose the astronauts challenges with the state of America in 1969. <br /> <br />There are laughs too, and some of the episodes play up the humor.  <br /> <br />But ultimately you are left with a human connection to what was a human rather than solely scientific ambition - the story of the manyknown and unknown people who dreamed great dreams and achieved them despite overwhelming obstacles.  <br />
B000BM6IQW|5.0|After bying the original us release when i came out. i saw this one, now i personally think that the remix cd should have more mixes, and this is almost perfect, the metro mix of not a girl is one of my fav's, it has such a summer feel to it, and the mac quayle mix of stronger is awesome, also the bonus mix of someday is cool. kinda rockish with a dance pop sound. this version has better cover art and no copy protection and also comes with a sticker of the album cover and lyric booklet. this is definatley worth the extra money. u will love it!!!!!!!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|SOAD has really done an amazing job on this new album, it rocks. BYOB is a great song, though it has been overplayed significantly and that has deterred many people since it's original debut as a top song. <br /> <br />I love the CD though and think it is a lot better than the new album, Hypnotize. There are a few songs on the album I don't care much for, but overall I think it has been a great release.
B00005JO04|2.0|Just a bit of insight to everyone who wants to take this movie for real life.  I watched an interview on my HDNET channel with the writer and he said he traveled the middle east, met with oil officials, and more but ultimately created fictional characters and circumstances to make the movie more dramatic and gripping when asked.  A bit of advice, enjoy movies but don't take them for a history lesson.
0385512058|2.0|I found this book difficult to take seriously. It's advice is great if you are neurotically insecure and need everyone to like you, but I seriously doubt if you'll make many friends by pinging people you meet on planes. Ferrazzi comes across as an annoyingly insecure nuisance, name-dropping like it might impress people, spewing out blindingly obvious bullet points on how to be a human being. <br /> <br />His approach to networking is exactly how gay men chat each other up at nightclubs. It works if you have no family, no responsibilities beyond work and can affort to flirt from one casual acquaintance to another without worrying about depth of relationship. It's the business equivalent of casual sex. Enjoy.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|AH these songs are so catchy! They've been on repeat in my mind since the first listen. I'm usually the type of person who easily grows tired with songs and rarely listens to any twice in a row.. but I am guilty of doing so with some songs on Fever! This album is extremely uplifting and full of energy; it always puts me in a good mood. I usually don't pay too much attention to lyrics; through my ears, the singer's voice tends to blend into the background, sounding like another instrument, but these vocals DEMAND special attention, and the lyrics are quite impressive. The last two tracks (\\"There's A Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey...\\" and \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\") have become my favorites with their unique sound. If you're not a typical fan of 'emo' or whatever other genres this album has carelessly been thrown into, don't be turned off.. this album has a fresh sound that will appeal to many. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|2.0|I actually got their debut album (was given to me).  It wasn't some timeless masterpiece but was still a pretty good album.  It still retained some of Rage's, well, rage. <br /> <br />However, with this, they have totally been p**sified, probably by Cornell. <br /> <br />I was never a big fan of Cornell.  I thought he was a decent singer.  Not the best but certainly not the worst, unlike some people (like that wuss from Fall Out Boy).  I would never buy any of the Soundgarden albums.  The band was O.K. but I never saw what all the buzz was about.   <br /> <br />Rage obviously was better than Audioslave.  With Cornell you had to expect that they would be a bit softer, but at least on their first album they still had some of that rage.  There is none on this album.  I don't know what they were thinking.  This sounds closer to Soundgarden rather than a Rage/Soundgarden hybrid like it did on the first album. <br /> <br />The songs themselves aren't that good and I'm not impressed.  What happened to Tom's crazy soloing?  They're nothing like they used to be.  The songs are overall way too simplistic for these guys.  They're getting 2 stars, however, because they're not THAT bad.  I wouldn't buy this though. <br /> <br />I hate to do this but these guys are getting what they deserve.  Hopefully on their next album they will get some of that rage back and play more complex instrumentals.  If Cornell was responsible for the p**sification process, shame on the Rage guys for going along with him.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Honestly, I'm not sure what intrigued me about this movie beyond my superficial reasoning that Jude Law is gorgeous, and my love for Damien Rice, whose song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" played in the previews. Many of my friends told me it was BORING and horrible, but one day I was in the mood for a 'simple love story'; however, the complete opposite was in store. I could see how some may find it boring; the dialogue is pretty simple, and there aren't too many characters, but I feel that was the beauty of it. When too many unnecessary words are exchanged between numerous characters, it becomes difficult to uncover the true meaning of the film. Significant, poignant quotes become buried. There was much truth to the film, with emphasis on human's insatiable appetites for attention, unrealistic visions of love, and pure selfishness. I liked the motifs of lying/honesty, and evolution and human instincts (\\"The heart looks like a fist wrapped in blood\\"- Larry). I found it interesting how the characters naively felt they knewn each other inside out, when in reality, their relationships were based on lies. I thought I was in for a simple, romantic comedy but was pleasantly surprised; this movie certainly surpassed my expectations, and I consider it one of my all-time favorites. I thought all the acting was done well, especially Natalie Portman, who never ceases to impress me in any role, and in my opinion, outshone Julia Roberts. Only Portman can make a character so selfish, vulgar and immoral, appear sweet and innocent at the same time; she made her character truly lovable despite the harsh circumstances. I definately recommend this movie if you're looking for something a bit different, and have the patience and open-mind it requires.  <br /> <br />BTW, you should check out Panic! At the Disco's debut album \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\", which includes two songs titled after quotes from this movie.. \\"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off\\" and \\"Butit's better if you do\\". <br />:) <br />
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This cd is sooooo good.  it is one of her best.  I don't really like Britney Spears but I like the songs that people wright for her they are sooo good.  When I bought this cd I thought it was going to be like all the rest but the songs were going to be a little differnt.  I didn't expect it to be this good.  The best song on the cd is and then we kiss.  Hope this helps someone.
0761944524|5.0|<br />I came across this book when i was desperately searching for a book on statistics and SPSS. I found a number of books in the market,but after going through a few of them, i can frankly say that none of them are written in such a lucid and easily comprehensible way as Andy Field's book. I think this book is really very comprehensive and as well a user friendly manual of SPSS. Besides he has a very good sense of humour which one can find throughout the book which makes it much easier to comprehend the difficult concepts. In one word , my money was very well spent on this book. I shall wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who needs to learn statistical concepts and SPSS.
0446577383|5.0|Conspiracy. Conspiracy is the watch-word for this riveting novel by Virginia native David Baldacci. The action in the story is nonstop, beginning with three Muslims, two Arabs and a Persian, racing away in a Suburban while being chased by a helicopter. Later, a murder is witnessed by four eccentric friends. Both actions set up a chain of events which keep the reader flipping page after page, following with the main character, Secret Service Agent Alex Ford, as he and his partner Jackie Simpson, then Kate Adams attempt to find out just what in the world is going on.<br /><br />Baldacci shows his Southern roots with his writing style full of charm, wit, history and humor which seems to be genetically ingrained in the storytellers of Dixie. The setting is vivid, brightly or darkly so where appropriate, the plot is fast-paced, and the characters so well rendered that they almost seem like family. This reader laughed out loud at parts, almost wept at parts, and cheered at the end when victory for the protagonists was finally achieved.<br /><br />The Good: The characters are memorable and loveable. With the exception of one of the antagonists, the others are not your usual black hatted villains. Each has reasonable motivations for their actions. While we can hope that we would never cross the lines they did, Baldacci writes in such a way that this reviewer can at least contemplate the idea. The plot is intriguing. And the setting is described so well that one has to look up from the book to make sure one isn't in Virginia, D.C, or Maryland.<br /><br />The Bad: There was really nothing bad about this book. There were a few editorial errors, but nothing as bad as in other books read and reviewed.<br /><br />In closing, if you've read Baldacci before pick up The Camel Club. If you haven't, pick this book up. It is a great introduction to a wonderful author
0385512058|5.0|To be truthful i am not a businessman. I came across this book because of my interest in relationship and networking. <br />In his book Keith Ferrazzi writes passionately about developing relationships and he gives advice how to do it in a very upbeat way. His language is very lucid and it grabbed my attention from the beginning to the end. <br />I have a bit of criticism though. The ways he described to enrich the relationships are usually for extroverted personalities like himself. But introverted and shy people find it tremendously difficult to relate to people in the ways he suggests. Does he have any advice for these people? <br /> <br />However this is only a very minor criticism. This is a brilliant book on developing relationships in every sphere of life and i wish a very wide readership of this valuable piece of work. <br />
B000BO0LKY|5.0|You people are so STUPID that are capable of searching for a Mariah's album just to say negative things! Why do you care that much? Are you scared that your OLD and WITH-NO-VOICE diva with a HORRIBLE body AND face can maybe not be as good as you think she is? CHECK OUT NOW THE WEBSITE WWW.BILLBOARD.COM AND YOU'LL SEE WHO'S IN THE BEST POSITION! CONSIDERING THAT MARIAH RELEASED HER ALBUM MONTHS BEFORE MADONNA, SHE'S STILL ON BETTER POSITIONS ON ALBUM AND HOT 100 SONG CHARTS! It's very easy to say who's in #1 on the first week of release! <br />Now, who says that Mariah is fat is obviously blind (why are people even saying such absurd!?), or used to that monster that  Madonna is. I know very few people that couldn't even become pretty with so much money, and Madonna is a perfect example! <br />Mariah is astonishing pretty. Please, Madonna isn't pretty (at all!), she can't sing, she's old and didn't realize that (considering her new and hilarious video). Try to listen to SINGERS when you search for music and stop disturbing people who wants to buy some good music. And I'm sorry if some people can still sell albums and be successful enough to re-release your material! And just to clear the air. I used to enjoy some musics of Madonna, but I realize when things are over. And that's what I REALLY think of her. (All that promotion and investment just for a week on #1?). <br />Try to make a campaign for her. She definitively needs that!
B00005JO04|5.0|Syriana is a powerful expos&eacute; of the oil industry's influence on our government, thus on policy and national security decisions that determine our fate as a nation. The film doesn't introduce any new concepts but rather adds perspective to an already disturbing reality.<br /><br />The film's ultimate message is this: our thirst for oil is the core evil that will bring us down to our knees. Of course, that concept is not really all that new. Oil seems to always be the true motivation behind our meddling, which has left us hated, in the Middle East. As a result of that hate, 9/11 and the domino effect it started have already taken a huge toll on our economy and standing in the world.<br /><br />Syriana exposes the questionable relations between the CIA, Oil companies, foreign leaders, or rather dictators, and terrorist. At the end of the film, you'll have a thought or two on who should qualify for the loosely defined term \\"terrorist\\" among other things. It's a film for political junkies as much as the guy-next-door types that don't know where Saudi Arabia is on the map.<br /><br />The performances were stellar and the Arabic-speaking actors they had did an excellent job and they had not half-bad Saudi accents. The film's overall feel is similar to that of Steven Soderbergh's Traffic. Interestingly enough, Steven is one of Syriana's executive producers. Traffic was about drugs and so is Syriana. The only difference really is that oil cannot be snorted ... just yet.<br /><br />Go see it!
B000002U6E|5.0|Great melodies, great performances, great instrumentation/SFX.  Five stars for the amount of endorphins released at each listen.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I was so set to give this five stars.  I was really enjoying the show, the characters (The sole exception being the character of River Tam, who got incredibly annoying with the \\"craziness.\\"  I know the show was canceled before they could fully explain what her problem was, but that was dragged out for far too long.) and the world Joss Whedon created.  I am a big Whedon fan so it was no surprise that the show would be good but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS good.<br /><br />Then along came the last episode, \\"Objects in Space\\" and it killed a lot of the joy I had built up for the show.  I am dumbfounded by that episode, which features a black male character threatening two white female characters with rape and sexual torture.  The whole thing harkened back to the days decades ago when every black man was seen as a potential sexual threat to white women.  The script was written in such a way and his lines were given in such a way that there could be no escaping this racist subtext.  I felt like I had turned off \\"Firefly\\" and somehow started watching \\"Birth of a Nation.\\"  It was totally baffling how that got A) written, B) filmed and C) aired.  Aside from that, the episode's plot was preposterous, the pacing lethargic and the entire thing awful, awful, awful.<br /><br />The other awful things about this show are the theme song (hands down the worst I've heard for any show) and the DVD menus, which are totally primeval.  There are no extras menus and if you want to access the commentaries, you must do so via the \\"language\\" option on each individual episode screen.  There are more special features on the fourth disc, but they're sparse and underwhelming.  Mostly everyone just cries about how the show was canceled.<br /><br />However, if you skip the last episode and try to overlook the other downsides, you'll likely enjoy this show.  It's innovative, it's well-written and it has all the hallmarks of a Joss Whedon universe.  I am still eager to see the movie.
B00008PC2O|2.0|First off let me point out that another reviewer is writing his review based on the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of Terminator 2, not this edition. This is the \\"EXTREME Edition\\". The Ultimate Edition came out first, and as far as I can tell, is no longer available... though I wish it was. I will return to why in a moment. <br /> <br />Secondly let me say that I love the movie Terminator 2. I believe it to be a truly great Sci-Fi Epic by the great James Cameron, who directed \\"The Abyss\\" (a Sci-Fi classic that was one of the first movies to have a major scene use extended pieces of Computer Generated Special Effects ), as well as the classic \\"Aliens\\", and some might be surprised to know he also directed \\"Titanic\\". Cameron is a truly great director in that he tried to create great films that are multidimensional, incorporating character, dialogue, plot and indeed the visuals to create memorable movies. <br /> <br />T2: Judgment Day combined great effects (for the time), fantastic action (it set the standard for many years to come), human emotions and an analytical/philosophical commentary (on things ranging from human nature, to the relationship of technology and man, to fate). Thus T2 is not just a great Sci-fi movie, or a great action movie, but a great FILM. Arnold might not be the best actor, but at least he plays a machine, which ironically is the one thing he might be cut out to portray believably. Fortunately the rest of the cast, particularly the actress playing Sarah Connor, do a fairly good job in their expanded roles of putting a human side to this story. <br /> <br />Yes, if I was just rating T2 as a movie I would give it 5 stars. However, I can't give this edition DVD of the movie 5 stars. Why? Where to start. <br /> <br />Another reviewer gives detailed information promising you the world if you buy this DVD. This is simply not true. What the DVD does contain is a Special Edition Digitally Re-mastered version of the movie. The special edition also includes up to 16minutes of additional footage from previously deleted scenes. That's great! What's not so great is that there is no option to play the original version of the movie (without these new scenes) and unfortunately, while they are cool to see, I don't think all of them are really worthy. Some of these feel out of place, or it is easy to see why they were removed from the movie before release. Others are nice to have, but really I'd like the option. Unlike the other reviewer's comments, you don't have such option, it's part of the movie, and that's that. If I'm wrong about this, please email me and show me and I'll gladly retract this statement. <br /> <br />There's an audio commentary option, as well as a cool new \\"interactive mode\\" that gives constant information pertaining to the current scene. Sort of like that old show \\"Pop Up Video\\" for music videos. There's a huge amount of information here, and sometimes it will tell you to click enter to learn more and it will take you to some behind the scenes footage. Some of this is good. Some seems to not play right on my player (or it could just be how it was done). The entire movie is also in 16x9, which is nice if you have (or plan to some day have) a 16x9 widescreen TV or an HDTV. It's not so nice if you have a standard definition TV. Even typical widescreen is usually 2.35:1 aspect ratio. I usually prefer full screen myself (I like to use the whole screen for the picture) unless it's a movie I deem worthy of widescreen (such as movies with lots of big shots and beautiful cinematography, which T2 would likely apply). However I can tolerate, and even appreciate widescreen at 2.35, the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen are minimal. At 16X9 however, it's a bit obnoxious; the video is a thin \\"strip\\" across the screen and more of the screen is taken up by the bars than by the picture. boo. It would be nice if they could have given you the both wide and full screen versions, as other DVD releases such as the RamboSeries did where the full screen is on one side and widescreen on the other. Oh well. <br /> <br />Onto disc 2. Here you get 2 documentaries. Just 2. The other reviewer is talking about the ultimate edition, which indeed is packed with extras. What special features will you find here? One 20 minute documentary, and another 8 minute short! That's IT!! Here's what you DON'T get: Trailers, TV Spots, Interviews with cast and crew, a comprehensive \\"the making of\\" documentary, footage of the premier, etc. In other words, none of the stuff that was on the Ultimate (no longer available) Edition DVD!! None of the stuff you would EXPECT to be on the \\"extreme\\" edition, especially since it is trying to be the DVD to end all DVDs.  <br /> <br />You do however get a lovely foil-coated cover for the case! (note the sarcasm) You also get some bells and whistles like special DVD Rom features. Put the disc in your computer and install the necessary software and you can create a picture of yourself as a terminator or a short video clip showing your picture morphing into a T1000 or into another photo. That's all cool and what not, but really it's just a gimmick. You'll toy with it once or let your kids play with it, and that's it.  <br /> <br />There's also a 16X9 High Definition version of the Theatrical Version (no extended scenes) on this disc, but only for Microsoft Media Player 9. In other words you can only play it on your computer (a very fast computer, don't bother trying if your machine is less than 3 GHz or has less than 512MB of RAM and a decent video and sound card). What good is this? I can watch the other version in my computer on my standard DVD player software, why bother having this nifty high def version unless you really have the hardware to take advantage of it? I don't even get a regular theatrical version to play on my TV and they are giving me one that plays in my computer??!  <br /> <br />Moreover it irks me to no end that this edition lacks TV spots, trailers,and a comprehensive documentary. Even the Princess Bride DVD has all this! The most basic releases now have this standard. Especially with a movie like this I want to know the origins, the director's thoughts, the preproduction debates and storyline development, the casting, the compromises, etc. All we get is 28 minutes of fluff, most of which is just a short piece about T2's impact on digital effects, but never goes into full detail about their techniques. <br /> <br />Extreme? Extreme waste of money. If you have the Ultimate Edition, treasure it! And avoid this garbage unless you truly have a monster home entertainment center or a beast of a multimedia PC and want to put it to the test. If you just want to own the movie on DVD, try and find the Ultimate Edition if you can. You get more for less. Ultimate Edition has SO much this one lacks. Truly, this is a sad day for DVD consumers.  <br />Rather than buy this, you should email Artisan and complain.
B00004WCPY|5.0|What a well crafted album. From \\"Relax\\", the song used in the movie \\"Body Double\\" to Edwin Starr's \\"War\\" to Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\" to ditties such as (\\"Do You Know the Way to) San Jose\\" to the wretching ballad \\"The Power of Love\\" this miscollection of songs goes together explicitly well. There are more famous concept albums by The Who and Pink Floyd but this album is right in the same league with its originality and metaphors. Give it a listen and you'll listen again over and over, getting more out of it every time. Its well worth your time  to appreciate an album thats worth more than a passing glance. You'll be glad that you did.
B00003CXPD|3.0|I'm not sure exactly how the movie arrived at the end.  Billy starts out boxing, and ends up doing ballet.  I didn't get it.  Boys are supposed to do things like boxing, and girls do things like ballet.  I think this movie is about a confused child that needs some strong, male direction.  Perhaps the father should have been more careful with what he exposed his son to - definitely makes you think (I love movies that make me think).<br /><br />Regardless, Billy sure was a graceful dancer and it's a shame that dancing is for girls; Billy is SO good at it (why I bumped the rating up to 3 stars).  If you like movies that will make you feel excited, confused, and dazzled by dancing boys - WATCH IT!
B0000C8AW7|5.0|ARE YOU READY? Cuz, believe it or not, Bob Dylan will blow your mind. The coolest vibe I feel a record has ever had. Last time I wrote this I sau=id it was better than Blood on The Tracks, I won't say that this time because my original review was deleted, and I'm thinking probably because of that (BOT is sacred to most, never down play it... LOT is actually the bigger triumph though, sssh) Heres my NEW breakdown of this 2001 masterpiece....<br /><br />1.TWEEDLE DEE... At first I didn't understand why he chose this song to open the album, now I realize its placement is perfect, as this album is a mixed bag of ideas, in a burlesque style atmosphere, this sets up the vibe perfectly.<br /><br />2.MISSISSIPPI... The lyrics are insanely beautiful, and god damn, I've never heard Dylan sound better. Yes kids, that smokey old crow is actually Bob Dylan. The lyrics will continue to get better as we progress....<br /><br />3.SUMMER DAYS.. Officially the song that gets this disc in gear. Theres no turning back at this point, so just sit back and listen to what the man has to say, its well worth it.<br /><br />4.BYE AND BYE... a back porch, rockin chair dirge of a song. It sort of makes me want to be old. Very odd feeling.<br /><br />5.LONESOME DAY BLUES... Love it when Dylan does the blues. This band is off the hook, and though I'm not quite sure what he's ramblin about here, it still rocks a good ton.<br /><br />6.FLOATER... One of my faves here. The lyrics on this one just get better as you go, duck trappers, tobacco leaves, all the christmas carols on all the christmas eves.. I get gleeful when I hear this piece, especially the last verse.<br /><br />7.HIGH WATER.. Another killer tune, dark, mysterious blues. I saw him play this song live and my brain melted.<br /><br />8.MOONLIGHT.. Nice breather between songs, jazzy, Billie Holiday vibe going on.<br /><br />9.HONEST WITH ME... Due to circumstances I was in this was the first song I really took to back when I bought this four years ago. \\"I'm not sorry for NOTHING I've done!\\" Plus the band really rocks out on this one.<br /><br />10.PO' BOY... More awesome lyrics. Beautiful, yet spiteful, and mixed up with all sorts of tricky word play, plus a knock knock joke. Dig.<br /><br />11.CRY A WHILE... Another song that really shows the band rockin' out. More icy cool vocal chords on Bobby.<br /><br />12.SUGAR BABE... Love the line about \\"love is teasing\\". Get ready to hear a nice extended ballad, where Bob Dylan again saves his best lines for the end.<br /><br />SO GREAT. THAT GREAT. DON'T LISTEN TO NAY SAYERS<br /><br />AND DON'T COMPARE TO OTHER BOB D ALBUMS. That is sacrilige.NG I've done!\\" Plus the band really rocks out on this one. <br />10.PO' BOY... More awesome lyrics.

B0000640VO|1.0|Not really into films that are in languages I don't understand.  There were subtitles, but my DARN TV wasn't formatting the video properly so the subtitles were partially cut off.  Frustrating.<br /><br />As a result, the movie frustrated me and I couldn't even finish watching it.  Luckily, I rented two movies.  I also got \\"Are We There Yet?\\" with Ice Cube.  Highly recommend it.
0553801503|4.0|Despite the slowed-down pace, the writing is mostly good.  GRRM continues to be the master of character development.  Even his minor characters come to life and connect with the reader.  The new characters and storylines in the Iron Islands and Dorne provide a nice contrast to the ambiance of the previous books.<br /><br />Jaime's and Arya's scenes, though relatively few in number, are the highlight of this book.  These two characters have undergone extensive evolution throughout the series, and I look forward to seeing more of both of them.  OK, now for the gripes.<br /><br />First, I have to concur with many other comments noting that this feels like only half a book.  GRRM needs to punch it with the next installment in the series.  Second, what is up with the growing number of porn scenes?  If I wanted to be reading that crap, I'd select my books from the shelf with all the pink covers (incidentally, Feast is sort of pinkish).  Third, the whole thing about the army of religious fanatics suddenly popping up seemed really tangential and difficult to swallow (even in a fantasy book).<br /><br />That said, this book is still a million times better than Jordan's glacially-paced saga of no-name, whining pillow-friends who are all obsessed about not looking upset.

B0000019HU|5.0|With over 70 reviews of this i don't think there's anything i could say which hasn't already been said. So, here's the review Steve Albini wrote about it way back in 1991 :<br /><br />Since about 1980, America has been host to an ever-increasing parasitic infestation of rock bands of ever-dwindling originality. It seems there is no one left on the continent with an aspiration to lay guitar that hasn't formed a band and released a record. And that record sounds a little bit like Dinosaur Jr.<br /><br />Trust me on this; all but maybe three of those records are pure bulls**t.<br /><br />My primary association with rock music is that I am a fan of it, though listening to the aforementioned nearly killed that. In its best state, rock music invigorates me, changes my mood, triggers introspection or envelopes me with sheer sound. Spiderland does all those things, simultaneously and in turns, more than any records I can think of in five years.<br /><br />Spiderland is, unfortunately, Slint's swansong, the band having succumbed to the internal pressures which eventrually punctuate all bands' biographies. It's an amazing record though, and no one still capable of being moved by rock music should miss it. In 10 years it will be a landmark and you'll have to scramble to buy a copy then. Beat the rush.<br /><br />Slint formed in 1986 as an outlet and pastime for four friends from Louisville, Kentucky. Their music was strange, wholly their own, sparse and tight. What immediately set them apart was their economy and precision. Slint was that rare band willing to play just one or two notes at a time and sometimes nothing at all. Their only other recording, 1989's Tweez hints at their genius, but only a couple of the tracks have anything like the staying power of Spiderland.<br /><br />Spiderland is a majestic album, sublime and strange, made more brilliant by its simplicity and quiet grace. Songs evolve and expand from simple statements that are inverted and truncated in a manner that seems spontaneous, but is so pricise and emphatic that it must be intuitive or orchestrated or both.<br /><br />Straining to find a band to compare them with, I can only think of two, and Slint doesn't sound anything like either of them. Structurally and in tone, they recall Television circa Marquee Moon and Crazy Horse, whose simplicity they echo and whose style they most certainly do not.<br /><br />To whom would Pere Ubu or Chrome have been compared in 1972? Forgive me, I am equally clueless.<br /><br />Slint's music has always been primarily instrumental, and Spiderland isn't a radical departure, but the few vocals are among the most pungent of any album around. When I first heard Brian McMahan whisper the pathetic words to \\"Washer\\", I was embarrased for him. When I listened to the song again, the content eluded me and I was staggered by the sophistication and subtle beauty of the phrasing. The third time, the story made me sad nearly to tears. Genius.<br /><br />Spiderland is flawless. The dry, unembellished recording is so revealing it sometimes feels like eavesdropping. The crystalline guitar of Brian McMahan and the glassy, fluid guitar of David Pajo seem to hover in space directly past the listener's nose. The incredibly precise-yet-instinctive drumming has the same range and wallop it would in your living room.<br /><br />Only two other bands have meant as much to me as Slint in the past few years and only one of them, The Jesus Lizard, have made a record this good. We are in a time of midgets: dance music, three varieties of simple-minded hard rock genre crap, soulless-crooning, infantile slogan-studded rap and ball-less balladeering. My instincts tell me the dry spell will continue for a while- possibly until the bands Slint will inspire reach maturity. Until then, play this record and kick yourself if you never got to see them live. In ten years, you'll lie like the c***sucker you are and say you did anyway.<br /><br />Ten ******* stars.<br /><br />Steve Albini.****** stars.  <br /> <br />Steve Albini.

B00008OLYN|5.0|OPETH - Damnation  -  This album transcends all stereo-types of metal music.  Opeth has always had hints of Classical, Acoustic, Prog and about 4000 other influences but first and foremost they are Metal!  And how a Metal-Band can pull this off is beyond me.  This albums is as beautiful as many classic prog-rock albums that influenced Opeth's slower style. (Floyd, King Crimson etc...)  Despite the musical beauty of this album it is quite possibly their darkest work... Just one listen to the tracks: Closure, Death Whispered a Lullaby, and To Rid the Disease. And you cannot help but feel the sadness and agony in Michael's voice.  Another great thing about this album is how Martin Lopez's drum skills are showcased... some fantastic drum beats.  Keeps this album flowing beautifully from start to finish...  Overall this is an amazing album, And even though I'm a devoted Metal-Head, out of all my \\"slower\\" or \\"prog\\" albums this one gets more spins than almost anything (Probably tied with - In the Court of the Crimson King)  Favorite Tracks:  In my Time of Need, and Closure.    -5.0 Stars.

B0000DZEE3|5.0|Without question, the Peppers have released a quality, live performance DVD. This DVD ranks up there with Cyndi Lauper's \\"Live...At Last\\" and the Talking Heads' \\"Stop Making Sense.\\"<br /><br />The audio is excellent. It's well mixed. The filming enhances the experience without too many post production effects. The overall production is of high caliber. This begs the question, why can't all contemporary recordings be of similar quality?<br /><br />There's a strong playlist that will keep you movin' around.<br /><br />If you are a Pepper fan, you'll love this DVD. If you just love a good concert, get out the alcohol, and whatever else, and enjoy the show.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Not only is Miller's Crossing one of the Cohen brothers' very best (in a list of countless phenomenal) productions, it is one of the greatest crime/neo-noir films ever made, and possibly even one of the greatest films of the last 40 years.<br /><br />The story of turmoil and curruption in the world of prohibition era crime is told with such subtlety and careful detail that one is pulled through a complex series of twists and turns in such a way that it all feel perfectly natural.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne's alcoholic gambler with a heart of gold (*wink*) is in the vein of Bogart's finest roles. Albert Finney's blinded by love political boss who \\"dosn't like to think\\" is the ultimate irish gangster. John Turturro's sniveling bookie is one of his two best performances (see Unstrung Heroes). Marcia Gay Harden is a unique femme fatale. Jon Polito's moronic Italian thug is as funny as it is brilliant. All of these characters give the film a sense of humanity and realism in what is essentially a mob opera.<br /><br />In addittion to the acting, the films production values create a real connection between the viewer and the world of the film. The contrasts in the film's lighting and production design are not only period perfect (with only the slightest hint of the Cohen Brothers' \\"more noir than noir\\" style) but a flawless example of why the film noir style is vital: duality. Everyone wants to be the good guy at some point just like everyone wants to be the bad guy at some point, and no matter what we want we're always a bit of both. Film noir is all about holding a mirror up to the face of humanity. Tragedy, love, deceit, honor, violence, and hollow and imperfect redemtion are all components of a good noir epic and this Cohen brothers' masterpeice has them all in spades.<br /><br />I have nothing bad to say about this film and would certainly place it on my top ten films of all time list. Watch it tonight!
B0000046KM|5.0|UPDATE!!!  Recently, I had to buy a new copy of this because I wore out my last TWO CD's of this ALBUM!!!  I literally listen to it every night at bedtime!  It will be the BEST purchase of music you ever made!!!<br /><br />I ran across this album title by accident when I bought a jazz sampling album from Verve.  I instantly fell in love with the title track, \\"Here's To Life\\" and immediately went out the next day and purchased the album.  There is never a day when I listen to this that I skip any tracks. Its a beautiful love story that Shirley tells from the first track to the last!!  You will not have one favorite track on this cd, you will love them all equally so!  This is a great cd to turn on when you are cuddled up on the couch with your loved one in front of a fireplace while its snowing outside and you just want to get in a wistful romantic mood.  Since I purchased this album, back in 1994, I have acquired all of Shirley's albums.  It was a great tragedy for me and my family and friends who adore Shirley to have learned of her death in October 2005.  I knew when I saw her at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage in April 2005 that THAT would be one of her if not last performances and I was honored to be there.  Though in a wheelchair and frail, Shirley sounded beautiful as always.  She will be remembered as one of the greatest jazz vocalist that did not get enough recognition for her career accomplishments!  Shirley...  You will NEVER be forgotten and I hope you and Miles are having a good time together!!!!!!!  All Love from me :)

B000B8QEYC|2.0|To be perfectly honest, I didn't like Amarantine very much, only a little, whereas I love her other albums. This is definitely not her best, and five years is too long to wait for a rather disappointing album. The songs are reminiscent (I do no want to use the word \\"rehashed\\") of her older -and better- ones. One example is \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" which is very similar in theme and rythm to \\"One by One\\" in \\"A Day Without Rain\\". Buy it only if you're a die-hard Enya fan, but if you're new to her music, try her master-pieces, Watermark, The Memory of Trees, and The Celts.

As a sort of unknown kid,Charlie gets along in his freshman year of high school whith some benevelont guides, and some definetly new experiences.  As you first meet Charlie, you sort of notice that he reads into his environment sort of different from other people.  Charlie's letters to an unknown revceiver will draw you in and will definetly not let you stop reading till you finish.  Charlie gets through his first year at high school after escaping a traumatic event involving an old friend with the help of his favorite teacher, and some new friends that he learns ALOT from.  Charlie's new life and experiences can make anyone say \\"that happened to me\\".  An extremely personal and easy to relate to story of a typical \\"wallflower\\", Chbosky did an excellent job in recreating the memories and life that everyone knows.If you read it, you are guarunteed to get something out of it.

B00009ATIX|1.0|The bottom line: see Tarkovsky's Russian 1972 version. (The actress here is better looking though.)  Believe it or not, the psychiatrist in the 1972 film was not Dr. Phil, he was a SCIENTIST!    If Denzel Washington can play a guy locked up in solitary for 3 months in \\"The Hurricane\\", then George Clooney should be able to play a Scientist.  If Tom Hanks can play a guy who has been stuck on a desert island for 3 years, in \\"Cast Away\\", then George Clooney should be able to play a scientist.    Instead, he plays a good looking synical know-it-all.  I.e., the role he played in Oceans 11 and every other film like the perfect storm.    Going on, the casting gets worse: why?  No scientists!    There's a black lady thesbian.  She looks like she can recite Hamlet from memory.  But she doesn't look like a scientist.  Not because she's black.  Her particular personality was out of place in this film.    The Americans butchered this one.  Clooney, the lead role, being the most belligerent and dissapointing.

B000021Y77|5.0|Tykwer created a cinematic monster when he shot Run Lola Run. The director  had a limited budget and time, so the choice of shooting with a digital camera made this opus possible. Tykwer had limitless possibilities with this media, and made full use of the surreal capabilities of his camera. The viewer is dragged on a journey through time and space, and s/he is left wanting more. The simple intense dialogue grounds this film in its setting and the thumping techno beats of the soundtrack keeps the viewers heart racing. This film is not only useful for modern German cultural studies, it is ideal for the German language classroom. Run Lola Run is a memoir of a moment in history. The red haired heroine races to unite the once divided city of Berlin, and in doing so tries to find an identity for herself and the German people. Entertaining and heart wrenching, this film stands the test of time. Run Lola Run is a masterwork of post-unification German cinema. Whether it be the digital shots, the pulsing soundtrack, or the repeating storylines, this film takes the viewer on a journey that s/he will never forget.

B000BISBDY|5.0|It's always difficult to make a greatest hits package on one single CD for an artist with a career of half a century (Ray Charles, Elvis Presley and others) so let's be honest and say that everything is not here. BUT it's a good collection of Johnny Cash's legacy. It mainly focuses on the early days at Sun and the last days with Rick Rubin and there's only a few tracks of his sixties and seventies recordings.<br />So I'd say that it's a good way to learn where the legend began and where it ended but it's frustrating to hear almost nothing from the rest except A BOY NAMED SUE, SAN QUENTIN or MAN IN BLACK among others.<br />ONE PIECE AT A TIME (from the seventies) or WHAT IS TRUTH (from the sixties) could have been better choices than THE WANDERER (a bad song from a 1993 U2 album) for example.<br />Anyway, it's a superb album that deserves its success. It can already be considered as THE Johnny Cash collection.<br />PS: When I say it's a pity ONE PIECE AT A TIME is not on the CD although it is, it's because I made the review after the European tracklist of the CD where we don't have ONE PIECE AT A TIME. Anyway, the tracklist is quite identical.
B00000JRTX|4.0|This is a lovely British romantic comedy - but therein lies my problem.  Like a previous reviewer, this reviewer has an issue with the DVD - not the movie itself. Well - actually - the movie itself too - as I had to come here to read how the characters are related - or not - to each other as it wasn't explained clearly in the movie. Or maybe it *Was* explained and I just didn't catch it, which brings up my other issue: there are subtitles provided in Spanish and French, but NOT English.  Now, I was born and have spent my entire life in \\"the Heartland\\" of the USA - from Canada to Texas.  British English, to me, is a 4th language, for which I do not have an \\"ear.\\" I did Not have any problems with the Bridget Jones movies or A&E's excellent \\"Pride and Predjudice,\\" but, with this one, as with anything Monty Python, I wish they would provide English subtitles [closed captioning for the BritSpeak impaired?] - instead of my fumbling through repeated rewinds and my knowledge of French and Spanish just to figure out what those people who purport to be speaking the same language as me are sometimes saying! ;-) It does, however, become more intelligible upon subsequent viewings, as confabulation can kick in. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|There are a number of things that are unforgivable in this movie, and what's significant about them is that they all stem from the writing. <br /> <br />While the number of Oscar nods `Titanic' received might have been contentious, there can be no argument that James Cameron didn't deserve one for his screenplay. While his storytelling strengths lie mostly in a clear, confident and sturdy hold on and account of the historical events that transpired, his characterisation leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br />Stereotypes abound amongst the passengers on board, the most glaring being the overly emphasised contrast between the apparent wisdom of the bereft and rustic, and the ignorance of others well off to the point of apathy and callousness, since it is, basically, the primary means by which the two protagonists are drawn to each other. <br /> <br />Character development is hardly aided by some very campy and affected lines and scenes. Jack's rescue of Rose from the latter's attempted suicide, for instance, strives for amusing, unexpected absurdity as Jack manages to interject with a brief lecture on ice-fishing, but tumbles off the thin line into being plain ridiculous. The deleted scenes on this DVD reveal the very worst of Cameron's trite writing that, thankfully, never made it to the final cut. If he can't be credited with decent writing, though, he certainly gets the thumbs up for storytelling instincts. It's a genuine fortune, for example, that Brock's Epiphany didn't end up as the movie's conclusion. When Bill Paxton awkwardly asks Rose's granddaughter for a dance, the by-the-numbers Carpe Diem contrivance gloriously implodes from a false sense of what constitutes an emotional resolution. It takes you away from Rose by trying fruitlessly to accommodate Brock's moment of enlightenment, and, by tacking on a lesson about making the best of life, it feels strained and thoroughly undermines everything Rose was put through.  <br /> <br />Several elements save the movie, though, and one of them is good acting, particularly from Kate Winslet. To an extent it doesn't harm that her reputation precedes her in this movie - because we know she has the acting chops to pull off more intelligent material like `Sense and Sensibility', we know the vigour she exhibits when emoting is a real attempt at getting close to her character and not overreaching. Her sincerity makes Rose's blossoming convincing, and it's the same honest quality with which she fills the shoes of her character that salvages her suicide scene with Leonardo DiCaprio, for one, from being entirely unbelievable. Again, there are several instances where Cameron tries too hard to drive home the characteristics of each onscreen persona, but in the case of Rose, who stares wide-eyed and surprised at horse-riding with one leg on either side and petulantly and weakly commands Jack to return to his part of the ship, Winslet gives her enough credibility for her responses and actions to be taken seriously. One of the most dangerous character moments - as a result of limp writing - is when Rose tries to deflect Jack's inquiry into her feelings for Cal. Brushing off the subject with a line like `This is not a suitable conversation' reads as too blatant an attempt at being evasive and, thus, loses the subtlety of, what should have been, the conveyance of a woman's knowing self-deception, her fear of confronting it and the consequences of that confrontation, and hence her choice to linger in her tortured comfort zone of delusion. However, Winslet brings across her insecurity and veiled vulnerability well. It's an example of why it is largely because of her that we invest ourselves emotionally in Rose's story, which, ultimately, is the spine of `Titanic' - it is the main narrative. Of course, there are supporting performances that contribute fruitfully to the telling of her story, and when actors like Kathy Bates, Gloria Stuart (who gets the most contemplative and well-written lines),Bernard Hill, Victor Garber and Billy Zane add touches of pathos, spunk, torment or sheer malevolence, that is no harmful thing. <br /> <br />Even as he succumbs at times to indulgence (if he'd left the car out, the portrait-sketching alone would have become one of the most original love scenes ever), Cameron's occasional knack for nuance helps the movie along as well. Sometimes he effects it through his actors, for instance Cal carelessly, brusquely and rudely slamming Rose's music box shut before introducing the Heart of the Ocean, his misperceived key to her heart. Other times he does it with James Horner's wonderful score. Notably, Rose's suicide scene is graced by a simple piece of music that strikes gently yet unflinchingly at the core of her plight. As she clambers over the rear of the ship, we hear Sissel hauntingly singing a poignant lament for Rose. Setting this scene to that piece of music is an example of sheer observance and sensitivity, as, with so many contemporary movies choosing to depict suicide as an act of angst or rashness, or even a bargaining tool to make a point, it becomes so easy for audiences to forget the fundamental sadness of the act.     <br /> <br />While some of the material filmed was appalling (read: Deleted scenes, again), focussed editing saves the day and, in the end, keeps it all about Rose. The photography is quite remarkable, capturing the spectacle of the maiden voyage of Titanic, the terrible image of her demise, and, most importantly, the intimacy of character moments (this DVD, in particular, sees a restoration of the film to a quality virtually unmatched by any other, in this reviewer's opinion, making for a deeply satisfying visual experience).  <br /> <br />Gripes galore but one might say that this movie redeems itself in the way Wolfgang Petersen's epic `Troy' does, and more successfully at that: Dramatic intelligence. Cameron knows his way about bringing an audience through a great course of emotion, which in no small part is attributable to his ability to entertain. His writing might have been improved, but it's clear enough that he never intended to sacrifice characterisation for mere technical wizardry. And, as much as we want to deny it, there is a palpable, compelling love for the work done here from Cameron at the helm. Perhaps that's why for a movie with its share of inexcusable flaws, it's had the luck to be received by an audience so forgiving.
0440241588|2.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors, but he is definitely an amateur when it comes to the spy novel/geopolitical action thriller category.  A major weakness of the book is that Grisham knows less about the intelligence business than anyone who has read a single Tom Clancy novel. <br /> <br />Grisham supposedly lives in Northern Virginia, home to the CIA, the Pentagon, and a gazillion defense/intelligence contractors.  You'd think that he could have found someone in the area to talk to, but most of his \\"spy\\" info seems to come from the movies.  (And no, Mr. Grisham, nobody uses the word \\"counterspy\\".  Your editor should be shot.)  Instead, he seems to have devoted most of his time to researching Italian dining habits.  (You'll see what I mean.) <br /> <br />But let's forget about the \\"spy\\" part of \\"spy novel\\" for a while.  The problem is that it doesn't quite work as a novel either.  The characters are bland, the pace is very uneven, and the plot is lacking.  A lot of characters just are not believable.  You just have to hoot at some of the more cartoonish characters, like the beautiful yet deadly female spy from \\"Red China\\" who seduces men before helping to kill them. <br /> <br />But I digress.  I didn't mean to start making fun of the spy content again.  The bottom line is that if you want a good read, try another one of Grisham's novels.  Or if you want a real spy thriller, pick up Clancy.
B000BJS4BM|1.0|This Special Edition was ill conceived.  The Bonus Track is good for all hardcore Madonna fan's, but this packaging is an utter disgrace.  The journal is cheap and the entry is just lyrics from a song off the album.  The photo book is okay, bigger than the artwork for the standard cd, but lacking.  And don't expect lyrics either for all the tracks.  Overall this is uninspired with no real special qualities.  If you are collector get it, if not download the song elsewhere.  Hopefully there will be another Limited Edition with more extras...take a cue from other artists Madonna and WBR.
0060277270|5.0|While this is not my favorite book in the Chronicles of Narnia, it still merits five stars and is an excellent book.  Few authors can capture the imagination like C. S. Lewis was able to do, and I doubt that many will ever be able to again.  This book is unbelievable, yet believable.  Extraordinary and impossible things happen, yet Lewis describes things like the meal set before them at the Beaver's Dam so eloquently and vividly, it makes you seem as if you were there, and when you realize you are not, you are suddenly very hungry and wishing you had some fresh fish just caught from the icy river.    In addition to being a fantastic story, it contains a point, something which many modern fictional stories fail to do.  In this book, C. S. Lewis lays out the crucifixion and Ressurection of Christ, except in Narnia Christ is not a man, but a lion, and not named Jesus, but Aslan.  The power and majesty of the Great Lion impresses one while reading, yet his kindness and love shine through no weaker.  Lewis does an amazing job of presenting to us the Christ of another world, and I cannot imagine anyone doing a much better job of it.    If you have seen the recent movie which models itself after this book, you have seen but a shadow of the real thing.  The book is thousands of times better than either the PBS version or the new release.  The new release managed to take the focus off of Aslan and put it instead on the children by talking about how the hope that the children have brought has ended the winter, whereas in the book, it was Aslan's power which did it (among numerous other changes to this effect).  The movie both lowers Aslan and the importance of the death and ressurection of Aslan, and I think that it fails to capture the real essense of this work.  The real thing is so much better, it is well worth the time required to read it.
0446677450|5.0|Just think where RTK would be today, how sooner he would have amassed a fortune and be empowering people like us IF only he would  have forgone going to college and followed his 'Rich Dad's' advice much sooner!  <br /> <br />Having gone through the \\"left brain\\" school of \\"wisdom\\" myself, I do agree that every college student and graduate should read Rich Dad Poor Dad if for nothing else, just to clean their minds out a little bit. <br /> <br />Great book, Easy to see what it is a best seller and why it will be around ad infinitum.
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This was a gift to Me for Yule.  I have to say that I was amazed with this set!  The \\"limited edition animation cell\\" is actually like a 2-dimensional lithograph which fits into a 5x7 frame quite nicely. I placed a small strip of cardboard across the bottom and top between the two layers to maintain their individual dimensions.  It looks absolutely stunning within the gilded frame.<br /><br />While there is no added footage/film-time with the collectors set, the bonuses and extras make this SO worth the money spent!  It is a true delight to own!<br /><br />Brian Froud's postcards of the goblins he created for this cinematic work are priceless, and I've put them in a small post-card-sized photo album to keep them in good shape.<br /><br />This is a definite must have for any real fan of the movie.<br /><br />I gave this Collector's Edition Boxed Set a 4.6/5 rather than a 5 because I felt it really should have showcased David Bowie's music more.  I really would have appreciated an additional disk, or even a couple of music videos added to this set, to make it complete.
6305291446|5.0|Yeah, this one was just, well, what can I say, awesome!  It was everything it should be.  I was VERY leary upon watching this movie for the first time.  Halloween 4, 5 and 6 were just horrid.  I was expecting a real letdown.  But boy did it deliver!  Very scary, and I really loved the idea for the boarding school.  That fit real well in the story.  Jamie Lee did a great job as did the rest of the cast.  Acting was great and totally believable.  A good Michael Myers as well.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way thru.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|This is a masterpiece: truly a rock opera likely to establish itself as this generation's Tommy.<br /><br />Superficially it's damned fine music, and even better live if you get the chance: Billie Joe Armstrong is a consummate entertainer. Upon closer examination one readily observes that this body of work is a revelatory comment on the sublime nature of the human spirit and condition. Whether one is an angsty teen embarking on fresh independence, or a weary midlifer reconciling the absurdity of the world with battered morality, the vicissitudes of life somehow seem more bearable with these refrains echoing in the brain. It's a must have for ALL thinking music lovers.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Oh boy, is this show a joy to behold. I would just like to add the 1911th plea for this show to be returned. It's my belief that if this show had been allowed to run into a second season, word of mouth would have propelled it into Star Trek-like cultural awareness. It's that good. In a lot of ways, it's much better than Star Trek......gritty, grungy...real. Like most others that have reviewed this show, I was led to it by a friend, and I resisted. I received it (Firefly - Complete Series Box Set) in the mail one day from him unannounced. Still, I sat on it for months. The thought of a sci-fi western with Chinese influences just made my stomach churn. Finally, on a bored afternoon, my wife upstairs doing homework, I popped it in.  <br /> <br />I watched 2/3rds of the first episode and was in tears with joy and laughter, and fully in love. I ran upstairs and begged my wife to abandon her responsibilities and come see this. As expected, she resisted as well, citing the same reasons. \\"Sci-fi western? Honey, I love you, but....you know that's not something that I would enjoy.\\"  <br /> <br />Well, I begged.....and begged. She finally acquiesced to 1 hour, 1 episode to make me happy and get me off her back. 14 hours later we had a deep, collective anger towards FOX for cancelling this gem. Both of us have since become, like so many others, Firefly evangelists. And so far, as I spread the word, not one has resisted.  <br /> <br />This show just brims over with quality. Every aspect of it is masterful. Please, please....bring it back, someone. Let's all buy lottery tickets, and if one of us hits it big, our problems are solved.  <br /> <br />And thanks Joss.

B000059LGC|5.0|Death on the Nile is my favorite motion picture along with Murder On The Orient Express...This movie has an Outstanding cast giving brilliant performances of Angela Lansbury who plays Salome Otterbourne the drunken novelist -- her role was superb..should have gotten an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress for this film...glad she won the National Board of Review award.  Peter Ustinov was great as Hercule Poirot, Bette Davis and Maggie Smith were terrific having comedy parts, Mia Farrow, Lois Chiles, Simon MacCorkindale, David Niven, Jack Warden, Jane Birkin, Jon Finch and George Kennnedy had great roles in this movie.  I can watch Death on the Nile over and over again.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This is the type of album that will grow on you.   <br /> <br />Old Korn fans = don't give up on Korn just because they are experimenting with new musical styles.  The \\"old\\" Korn still remains, but the writing and lyrics are more refined.  This album is great to listen to on headphones on full blast...that is how you can really notice all the little intricate details the band has put into each song. <br /> <br />Newbies = try something new.  I recommend the deluxe edition just because the bonus CD has some real kickass songs.  You can get the whole thing for real cheap here at Amazon. <br /> <br />In general, this album is a grower.  I saw Korn live on Dec 8th and they are just as talented as ever.  Everytime I see them live they just get better and better.  So what they lost Brian Welch...they still got each other!
0307276902|5.0|I haven't read a book in about 10 years and I saw James Frey on Oprah and I really wanted to read this book.  I started reading it Sunday evening and I was finished Wednesday evening.  I could not put this book down.  When I went to bed I was thinking about what I was going to read the next page and the page after that.  It's unbelieveable that James survived.  The relationships he has with others in rehab are like life long friends, they only survive I think because they have each other.  I have asked for his other book \\"My Friend Leonard\\" for Christmas.  I hope it will sort of continue where \\"Pieces\\" leaves off, as Leonard if the father figure from \\"Pieces\\".  You are truly cheering James on page after page.  You so badly want him to succeed.  The only warning is if you are bothered by strong cursing, you may have trouble with this book.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Constantine (Francis Lawrence, 2005)<br /><br />Take a British chainsmoking paranormal detective and decide to make a movie based on one of his cases. Quick, who's your first casting choice? Bet \\"Keanu Reeves\\" wasn't the first name to come tripping off your lips. Yet it was someone's, and thus John Constantine trades his trademark accent and Silk Cuts for Reeves' surfer-boy drawl and what seem to be Marlboros, though at one point Beeman brings him a box of what look like Dunhills from a distance. (We never see him with a Dunhill pack in his hand, though.)<br /><br />That said, the movie did turn out oodles better than I expected it to. In this episode (for we know this is going to turn into a film franchise, don't we, kiddies?...though how that will happen given some of the events in the film's closing half-hour I'm not sure), Constantine is contacted by Angela Dodson, a police detective (Enemy at the Gates' Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister recently committed suicide at the local mental hospital. (Odd point: when was the last time you saw a mental hospital as large as Ravenscar is depicted here?) Constantine at first refuses to help her, but changes his mind, and very quickly finds himself embroiled in extremely nasty events that put not only him, but his contingent of friends, in great danger.<br /><br />The strangest thing about the movie is the portrayal of Constantine himself. Not only is he now American (and not smoking nearly as much as one would think Constantine would), but he's, well, a nicer guy. He's presented here as someone who understands the value of give-and-take, as opposed to the almost violently selfish Constantine of the graphic novels (and the film's portrayal makes some of Weisz' lines, while they're talking about Constantine's past, ring rather oddly). Still, the script jettisons kinder, gentler Constantine as often as needed, usually for laughs at the expense of Chas (Holes' Shia LaBeouf in what should be his breakout role), John's everpresent sidekick.<br /><br />All that aside, the story has some semblance of coherence and doesn't wander off into too many distractions, unlike the comics upon which it's based. As I alluded to previously, some of the things that happen in the final scenes are going to make doing sequels rough if they have any intention of remaining faithful to the books, but the end is definitely set up for a Constantine 2.<br /><br />I get the feeling this is one that will leave most people going \\"eh. It was okay.\\" ** ½resent sidekick. <br /> <br />All that aside, the story has some semblance of coherence and doesn't wander off into too many distractions, unlike the comics upon which it's based.

B000002JPA|5.0|Images & Words by Dream Theater has  to be one of the best prog-rock albums ever (if not the best). This album is currently my favorite DT album, most say that it is 'Scenes from a Memory', but that album isn't catchy as this is, this album blew me away on the first time unlike SFAM, but that album still grows on me with time. However what really efficients on it is absolute perfection. If I have any complaints, they are about 'Surrounded' which falls short in comparison to the other songs, although it's not really bad and about that the drums are bit overboosted but not that, I'm only sayng that because the production makes them sound weak, but not really. And all in all it caps off the best album of the 90's title. Note to any Nerdvana fans around, your precious 'Nevermind' CD does not even come close to be the best album of the 90's!!     Here's the rating for the songs (I've updated this review since my opinons have been changed).    Pull Me Under (10/10): This is probably the catchiest song on the album and basically DT's only real hit. This one was once may fav, it's no longer but still amazing.     Another Day (10/10): The first and best \\"slower\\" song on the album. It's somewhat underrated by fans since it sounds kinda poppy. However the song was actually for Petrucci's father who was diagnosed due to cancer.     Take the Time (9/10): Probably the thrashiest song on the album. Fast drum beats, rough vocals, fast solos. However somewhat cheesy because the middle part is a bit self-indulgent, but it is still great.    Surrounded (7/10): The 2nd slower song on the album. I brought it down cuz it's kinda bland although the instruments are great. Don't get me wrong, I like it but it's just not one of the songs I wan't to listen again and again.    Metropolis Pt. 1 (10/10): This was also used to be my favorite. The intro is great, the vocals are in top notch and the solo is great, and there's also a bass solo. This is also the first part of the \\"Metropolis\\" phase,SFAM will make the 2nd part.    Under a Glass Moon (50/10): Okay now we're cookin, if you thought the first 5 tracks were great you've still heard nothing, this is easily the best song on the album. It's the heaviest, the vocals are excellent. IMO, this has the best solo from the album. But perhaps the most important thing is that all the instruments go flawlessly together. If not THE best Dream Theater song, definitely a top 3. This is perfect.    Wait For Sleep/Learning to Live (12/10): The reason I combined both songs is since WFS is basically the intro to the next song. Also the piano note in WFS repeats in the middle part in LTL. Anyway this is the longest song on the album, the double-bass drumming is great, it has the best chorus here, also the solo is great. 2nd best song on the album.    There are no bad songs here. I just don't get, how can anyone not like this album. I usually don't write long reviews but this album is long and deserves a well-thought review. But anyway it definitely worths the 13 bucks.    UP THE IRONS!!
1401207928|4.0|Alan Moore, V for Vendetta (Vertigo, 1990)<br /><br />If there is any justice in this world, a thousand years from now, the name \\"Alan Moore\\" will be mentioned, and the word \\"Watchmen\\" will still immediately be heard. Moore, creator of arguably the finest graphic novel of the last century, had already made a habit of turning out excellent work; this book (started a few years before Watchmen, but finished slightly afterwards) is hard evidence.<br /><br />V for Vendetta (as I write this, soon to come to us in film version) chronicles a near-future Britain (well, okay, it was \\"near-future\\" then; the book is set in 1998) where a Fascist government has taken over and most of the world's population has been wiped out by a nuclear war. Into this atmosphere comes V, a Guy-Fawkes-masked vigilante, who saves young Evie from a gang of cops, then allows her to recuperate at his place, where he has done his best to preserve the culture stamped out by the fascists. V has a plan, but no one's quite sure what it is at the beginning. Eventually, the world thinks it knows-- but only Evie gets the full picture, which is as startling as it is fulfilling.<br /><br />Well, fulfilling except in one sense. To say what that sense is would be a spoiler, but I'm sure those who've already read it know what I'm talking about. (And to you I say: yes, I know that answering that unanswered question would have undermined the whole point of V's character. But I still want to know.)<br /><br />If you get a chance-- and you should, as Vertigo have just re-released the book in preparation for the upcoming film-- read this before the movie comes out. It's good stuff, as is to be expected from the prolific pen of Alan Moore. *** ½
0553801503|5.0|I thought the latest installment in George R.R. Martins A Song of Ice and Fire was fantastic.  I have read some of the less than stellar reviews on this page and find their reasons for downing this book to be ridiculous, if you are a fan of this series.  One complained about the introduction of new characters, well you have to introduce characters in a story where people are constantly getting killed.  Another complained about a character no longer being a rogue, I believe that is called, in English Lit., a dynamic character.   <br /> <br />Anyway I'll get off my stump now and tell you that this book is great for what it is, which is half a book.  In a Feast for Crows you only get the story taking place in the southern half of Martin's Westeros. The rest of the story will be told in A Dance with Dragons coming next year.  There are plenty of the things that you have come to love Martin for in this book, political intrigue, mystery, action, and I thought it ended on a pretty good cliffhanger.   <br /> <br />Anybody who can insultingly liken Martin to Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind is a fool.
B00005JLR2|4.0|I remember when we had this at the theater I worked at and hardly anybody was going to see it. I was bored on one of my shifts so I sat in it for about a half an hour or so and I was amazed! The story may not be a total adaptation of the original classic and it may not be a very traditional or memorable Disney film (not much vocal music put into it), but nonetheless, it was a very interesting retelling and it is very sad to know that Disney won't be doing many films of this caliber or with cel animation anymore. I think it will be their undoing.
B0002VK66U|5.0|Joe Lynn Turner has sold over 7 million albums, had 4 albums on RCA, been with Deep Purple, Rainbow, Yngwie Malmsteen, toured with Night Ranger, Pat Benetar & Loverboy, sung background vocals for Cher, Michael Bolton, Billy Joel & John Waite but most people do not know him. This CD was his first solo project and it is very good. He is definitely a top 5 AOR male singer. There are no fillers on this CD. Standouts are: Losing You, Rescue You, Soul Searcher & The Race Is On. If you like AOR music or his work in Deep Purple or Rainbow you need this solo project. He still continues to put out quality music after 20 years. Check out his other solo projects for more releases.
0895260131|5.0|AS an american christian whose actually read the Koran I ask the following questions: <br /> <br />1)Where did Muhammed (or whoever really wrote it) get the knowledge that Noah was ridiculed by townspeople while building the ark? This isn't in the Torah or Bible. <br /> <br />2)Where did that bit about Noah's son dying in the flood come from? Noah is Torah/Bible-mentioned as having three sons (Ham, Shem, and Japhet) and they all survive the flood. What was this other's son's name? <br /> <br />3)The Koran, to it's higher credit on this one, admits a genealogical relationship between man and apes (dna studies prove we are related to all apes). But the Koran badly claims an equally close relationship of man to pigs! Is this true? No it certainly isn't as DNA tests show conclusively. Stupid claim! <br /> <br /> <br />Highly likely all these and other non-Bible/Torah elements were simply invented by the writer(s?) of the Koran to make it slightly different than the Bible/Torah. <br />The Bible being far earlier written has the upper hand over the Koran in most departments and makes a better guide book in religion and much history. That's one boon for Christianity over Islam. <br /> <br />I learned quite a few interesting things about Islam in this book like that they often mistreated Christian extra-taxed taxpayers living in Muslim countries. ALso, that to try to convert away from Islam, always if you're in Islamic society, is punishable by death! Look everyone maybe 700 years ago it was 9 tenths as bad to try to convert away from Christianity in europe but European Christians mostly gave up this and other very brutal practices long ago. Many muslims are still holding these brutalities true in their otherwise modern ways of life. They are on average worse and besides most Christians were never quite this bad in history.   <br />

B0000542D2|2.0|I've tried to watch this DVD a number of times but the songs don't sound the way they should, the way they were meant to sound, and this ruins the entire movie for me. It's a shame because this movie is the greatest. <br /> <br />Why can't they just release the movie in its original form so that viewing it would be like seeing it new in 1964? In the early nineties AMC played a lovely restored & cleaned up version. Why not release that version? Then, as a bonus, throw in some original trailers and the \\"You Can't Do That\\" footage.  <br /> <br />When you have a perfect film to begin with....don't mess with it!
B000089RVX|5.0|I love music, but usually do not like most of the songs in a CD. I usually buy one for 2 or 3 songs, but rarely enjoy all the included songs. However, this CD is special, it's just amazing. I love everything on it. It's one of the rare CDs that are great overall. If you are an Eva fan, it's well worth your money.
B0009PVZWI|3.0|Tired of reading reviews that just whine about copy-protection and instead want to hear someone talk about the actual music on the CD? Well, here you are.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear that a lot of people didn't like Foo Fighters' last album, One By One; even Dave Grohl said it wasn't that great. I thought it was pretty good; I gave it four stars (I mean, it was no Colour & the Shape, but...). Anyway, in light of the band's ten-year anniversary, they brought us a new album in the form of a double-disc, In Your Honor.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains lots of hard-hitting stuff, like the title track and \\"Best of You\\". And I think their latest single \\"DOA\\" is one of the best songs they ever made. The only songs I can really do without on this disc are \\"Hell\\" and \\"The Last Song\\". And \\"End Over End\\" cuts off rather than goes off.<br /><br />Disc 2 is what a lot of people seem to have a problem with, in that they're all acoustic songs. I really have no problem with that per se, but the thing is that the songs are a little hard to distinguish from one another, despite standouts like \\"What If I Do\\" and \\"Cold Day In the Sun\\" (and \\"Virginia Moon\\" kind of sounds like a show tune). Plus, we all know that the guys have done acoustic songs before, but I'm not sure true Foo fans will want to hear 43 straight minutes of them.<br /><br />Even though this is the first Foo Fighters album I have given less than four stars to, it's not bad by any means. It's still very representative of the band's talent, so it's definitely worth picking up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00000JCOV|4.0|I'm not really much into the new stuff but slipknot caught my ear and I decided to give their music a try. The sound is diffrent from alot of bands and this is some heavy stuff. In my opinion this is the best Slipknot album. It's way better than Subliminal versus. Songs that are good are (sic), surfacing, and liberate. And for the guy that said that they're trying to be like korn, I respect korn but slipknot and korn have way diffrent sounds. You need to get your ears checked because this album is more heavier.
0684800713|3.0|The Sun Also Rises is written in the usual, stripped-down style of Hemingway, and it tells the story of several dissolute expatriate friends making their way around Europe. The narrator, Jake Barnes, is a war veteran with a unique injury that has rendered him impotent. The woman he loves, a beautiful noblewoman named Brett Ashley, craves a physical love that he can't provide, throwing them both into the agony of wanting what they can't have. The two leg it around Paris and Spain with an odd collection of friends, which includes a rather annoying Jewish writer and Ashley's drunk, broke fiancee.<br /><br />I didn't actually like this book, but I kept reading it because I wanted to finish it. All of the characters seem to be alcoholics, and they seem to lead lives bankrupt of any real meaning. I didn't really like any of the characters, and I kept wondering why Ashley and Barnes didn't get together . (I mean, he's impotent, but surely they could physically satisfy each other in some way. It seems rather foolish to throw away what could be true love just because the sex takes some work.)<br /><br />Although I realize that this is considered a classic, I finished it feeling largely unsatisfied. (Which, perhaps, was the point.) Although the book isn't particularly long, it takes a while to read it. The plot doesn't move quickly.
6301978587|4.0|YENTL is Barbra Streisand's most personal and important movie.  The film features Streisand the performer, Streisand the director, Streisand the screenwriter and Streisand the producer.  To say that YENTL was a labour of love would be an understatement.<br /><br />The plot, based on the original story of \\"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\\" by Isaac Bashevis Singer, concerns a young woman in Eastern Europe at the dawn of the 20th century.  Since women are forbidden from knowledge and study, Yentl is tutored in secret by her loving father (Nehemiah Persoff).  When her father suddenly dies, a desolate yet defiant Yentl runs away from her small village, disguises herself as a man and enrols to study with a community of scholars.  There she meets the charismatic Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin).  She finds herself falling in love with him, but he is smitten by beautiful Hadass (Amy Irving).  However, Hadass and Avigdor are forbidden to marry.  Avigdor proposes that Yentl enter into a marriage-of-convenience with Hadass so he may continue to see her.  All the while continuing with the charade of being a man, Yentl's world precariously begins to topple...<br /><br />Michel Legrand, Alan and Marilyn Bergman's musical score adds a lot of heartfelt emotion and depth to the proceedings.  Barbra Streisand handles the complicated title role with finess and style.  Patinkin and Irving are glorious and Persoff is superb.  A classic for the whole family.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I am a fan of the original King Kong movie as well as Peter Jackson's theatrical telling of The Lord of the Rings story, I saw this movie opening week and then bought the DVD on the first day available. I felt like I got more than an action movie. On the surface this movie is just action, but it is also a period piece and a love story. On a more intellectual level it delves into man's obsessive compulsive disorder with destruction.<br /><br />The Great Depression in New York is vividly depicted in the opening sequence. This section of the movie shows the desperation that many people had during those difficult times, which draws you into the character of Anne Darrow. She is a struggling actress looking for a big break, and Carl Denham takes advantage of her by promising a wonderful new career in his movie. Denham himself is desperate, because the funding for his masterpiece movie is in jeopardy. He urgently grabs everyone and everything he can to get his movie making passion on a ship bound for a mysterious place where he thinks his dreams will come true.<br /><br />On the ship bound for disaster, Anne Darrow meets her counterpart, Jack Driscoll. She respects his work yet thinks he is just a conceited playwright, but she softens to his romantically interested advances. They appear to have that spark of puppy love that we all have at one time experienced.<br /><br />On Skull Island, we hop on a roller coaster of action starting with savage natives to prehistoric creatures, gigantic insects to the great ape himself. This version of Kong is very real despite his gargantuan size. The mannerisms of a gorilla usually seen in a zoo are perfectly interpreted here by Andy Serkis who played Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. It is easy to fall in love with Kong just as Anne Darrow does, and it becomes hard to hold your emotions back when Kong is captured, brought to the big city for man's entertainment, and eventually destroyed.<br /><br />Carl Denham sets out to make a movie on an uncharted island, but his film and camera are smashed on the rocks of Skull Island along with his dreams. As if taking out his revenge, he feverishly brings down the beast with hopes of showing Kong off as a prize for a price. It is said in the movie that Denham destroys everything he loves, and it comes across as a metaphor for man's natural destructive behavior seen everywhere in this world as we know it. This even more evident when a scene shows one of the ship's crew who is reading a copy of \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" which not only suggests but foreshadows the natural result when men (Denham) are allowed to operate unchecked: power inevitably corrupts. Denham destroys everything he loves just as they said.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this movie, and I have been watching my DVD copy again and again. I was impressed with the retelling of this tale with new twists and added character development. Peter Jackson is truly visionary with his risk of undertaking the recreation of the beloved King Kong.an uncharted island, but his film and camera are smashed on the rocks of Skull Island along with his dreams.

I was impressed with the retelling of this tale with new twists and added character development. Peter Jackson is truly visionary with his risk of undertaking the recreation of the beloved King Kong.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This is a absoluting thrilling movie. Michael Mann's retelling of James Fenimore Cooper's classic, \\"Last of the Mohicans\\". I found that this is a a movie that I could watch over and over again, and find something new each time. And that's the best criteria I can think of to recommend this movie to you.<br /><br />The photography and scenery is stunning! Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe provide an intense romantic heat that doesn't need naked sex---also classic. The music, the choice of actors, the costuming, the battle scenes---all wonderful. Michael Mann has not diluted or ruined the movie by adding his own politically correct, Left-coast skewed vision..it's true as possible to the original book.  This is a movie you show to an 16-21 year old boy to wean him off the nonsense he sees in video games and popular gangstra shoot-em-ups. It's a movie that will keep an teenaged boy interested, and if you're lucky, would motivate them to go and read some decent literature. (It may be a little too little bloody for younger kids though---but so was the original classic.)
0060234814|5.0|Four children are sent to live away from home during a war, and stumble upon much more than they had anticipated.<br /><br />While playing a game of hide-and-seek, the youngest girl, Lucy, hides in a wardrobe.  What seems like the perfect hiding place eventually turns into a wonderful, mythical land filled with all sorts of strange beasts and talking animals.  There are centaurs, giants, and fauns; some animals I can't even really imagine.<br /><br />Upon her return from the fantasy world, nobody believes her story.  In fact, nobody noticed she was gone.  In the alternate world of Narnia, time is not related to time as we know it.<br /><br />Eventually, her brother Edmund (who I hated from nearly the first mention of his name) follows her through the wardrobe.  The plot thickens when Ed meets up with the White Witch.  She befriends him because of her fear for a prophecy that four children of Adam and Eve leading to her downfall.<br /><br />From there, the story seamlessly follows the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they travel through Narnia.  They learn that Lucy's friend, a faun named Mr. Tumnus, has been taken captive by the White Witch.  While Lucy feels compelled to help, the others are not all that interested; except Edmund, who is interested because of the pact he made with the White Witch to deliver all four children to her castle.<br /><br />Edmund betrays his family and goes the Witch.  What follows is an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil, ubiquitous Christian allegory, and the inevitable happy ending.<br /><br />There are shocks, surprises, twists, and laughs.  Perhaps the most important aspect of the story is the great leader Aslan, who is pure, and represents all that is wonderful (a not-so-subtle representation of Jesus).  It's not overbearing as some would assume, but it's definitely there.  Aslan teaches, nurtures, chastises, and leads.  He gives selflessly, and fights for all that is pure and just.<br /><br />The story is easy to read, allowing the reader to imagine, to become involved with the story.  You'll immediately love certain characters and take sides.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to fans of fiction, and anyone who wants to read a great story.  It's a wonderful book that transcends age and genre.> <br />The story is easy to read, allowing the reader to imagine, to become involved with the story.

B000002V0Q|5.0|When I heard peace sells I had to hear another album from this band. So I grabed a copy of Countdown to extinction and man this is pretty heavy. Not as good as the previous work but I still like it alot. Symphony of Destruction is one of the best Megadeth songs ever. I've been a Megadeth fan for a longtime now and this is an album that never gets old. Other good songs on the album are Sweating Bullets and Foreclosure Of A Dream. Great album from a great band that was started from a great guitarist. Megadeth forever.
B00080ZG1A|4.0|While I wouldn't call The Aviator one of my favorite movies, I did enjoy it. Of course, the stand out of the cast was Leonardo DiCaprio, who did a wonderful job portraying legendary millionaire, filmmaker, and aviator Howard Hughes. The film focuses on Hughes' early life, when he filmed Hell's Angels and The Outlaw. (Thankfully, the film closes before the period of his life in which Hughes became a total recluse, addicted to drugs, wasting away, and suffering from various crippling phobias.) The film also pays some lip service to Hughes' work in the field of aviation, his endless quest for bigger, better planes, and congressional committee hearings that kept Pan Am from being named America's only international air carrier.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Katherine Hepburn, and Cate Blanchette, while she certainly doesn't look the part, did seem to capture her personality and way of speaking. The relationship between Hughes and Hepburn was a central one in the film, and Blanchette and DiCaprio played it with warmth and tenderness. For their performances alone, this film is worth watching.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a period piece, and Scorcese and his team did a deft job of capturing the period with costumes, sets, props, and styling. Though a pretty long movie, fun casting surprises (Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Tripp, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner) keep it interesting.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have just started to explore Jazz, it's probably my last genre to embrace and I'm really enjoying it. I seem to gravitate towards the \\"cool\\" jazz sounds. This mellow masterpiece sounds just phenomenal in it's remastered form. This is very important to me as an audiophile. I love the bluesy mellow mood of this particular Jazz lp. The sax's and trumpets alteranting out of different speakers is a great effect. One of my favorites in a small but growing jazz library.
6304698526|2.0|I know this is considered a classic, but I personally did not like it. I thought it moved very slowly due to the minimal amount of action. Now, I love Steve McQueen just as much as the next guy, but I really do not think he played the hard-boiled, renegade cop all that well. His face didn't show any feelings of anger, frustration or rebelliousness. This film is famous for its car chase; I am sure that it was amazing for its time, but in this day and age, it is passe. The other thing that really bothered me about this film was its silence; there wa almost no soundtrack. Save for the occasional dialogue, song or sound effect, this felt like a silent film. The soundtrack elements that were present did not seem to enhance the story at all. <br /> <br />If you want to watch a movie about a hard boiled, renegade cop, I highly recommend any of the Dirty Harry series over this one.
B000003N7K|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful collection of songs that one could buy.  Johnny Hartman's deep voice mixed with some of the softest most moving sax play of Coltrane will make you want to have a candlelit dinner with someone special, and will sooth you like a warm bath.  This is an essential CD for any complete jazz collection.
B000BJS4BM|3.0|I waited an extra month after the original release of COTDF to buy the Special Edition, maily for the one month trial to ICON, to see if it was really worth joining for me, but even more for the bonus track, \\"Fighting Spirit\\".  I warn you: don't buy this if you're just an everyday Madonna fan, it's for the devotees!  That being said, I was kinda disapointed, not at the album, it R O C K S!!!! (and personally I give the cd itself 5 stars, but I'm rating on the package as a whole here), but like the journal?  I really have no use for this, though I did like the photo book alot.  Beautiful snapshots!  And... that's pretty much it, yeah it is kinda plain and makes you wonder if doubling the price for the special edition than just the regular album isn't just covering the price for the 1 month membership to ICON and bonus track, cause all in all, this SE is lacking just like the American Life SE.  Plus releasing the extra track \\"Super Pop\\" to present ICON members only?  Come on Maddie, shame on you, we deserve just a bit more than that I think.  Though I will thank her and WBR for making this cd able to be loaded into my iTunes for my iPod (unlike other ungrateful artists who's albums I have unknowingly bought and not been able to do crap with and will no longer buy), I am beyond grateful for that.
B000002H33|5.0|If you don't know that is a piece of metallica's opening track Battery. This is Metallica at there best. If your a metal fan than you'll love this album. You will definetly need to put this album in your cd collection. If your becoming a metallica fan than you'll love the headbanging, hard thrash metal, that Metallica once was. It's one of metallica's best work and they kept outdoing themselves back in the day. Now a days it just dosn't seem like it anymore for Metallica.But the songs I recommend are of course battery and Master of puppets, but other good heavy tracks like Welcome home(Sanitarium), and Leper Messiah. Good album and true metal right here.
1560100842|5.0|Every professional animator I've ever talked to has demanded that I learn from this book!  John K of Ren and Stimpy fame gives people that ask for advice on how to become animators a detailed instruction sheet on how he feels they should use this book to train themselves at drawing cartoons.  I learned a great deal about really drawing 3 dimensional things by using this book as well.  Sure the designs are of an older flavor but the information is timeless!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This band keeps on getting better on each of their new cd! I thought that this CD would be melancholy music, but when I turned it on, I was amazingly suprised. Beautiful music that invoke a rising of feeling (more of happiness) <br /> <br />Hoppippolla and Seaglopur are my favorites =)  <br />Mea Bloanasir is like the epilogue of hoppipolla =D <br /> <br />You have got to listen to this and also their (  )  CD
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson's Dangerous is outstanding.  It is one I have never got bored of.  I still can't get over how incredible the whole album is.  All of the songs are amazing because they are so original and funky. <br /> <br />Dangerous is of the same brilliant standard of the rest of his albums and is perhaps even one of my favourites. <br /> <br />Michael Jackson's sound is one that will never go out of fashion and will continue for many years to be the inspiration of many great artists to come.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This is hands down the best movie of all time, and to top it off this fabulous dvd had deletes scenes, alternate ending,music video, and so much more stuff! even though there are like 5 hours of stuff it is so worth it! And it is just fabulous! If you are in love with Titanic as much as i am (which is alot), you should most definetly get this DVD!
B000002H2H|4.0|LARS!!  That joke has got to be the worst drummer ever in a METAL band!!  He never does anything but basic beats and cymbal crashes!!  That being said, this is a great album instrumentally, it's a real shame that after this and Master of Puppets, the downhill descent would rapidly begin....  This album would be five stars if they would record the album over again with an actual drummer.
0151003084|5.0|Yes, it's sick.  Yes, it's twisted.  But it DEFINES gallows humor.  No, you're not an evil person for laughing at these rhymes and accompanying pictures; frankly, you're probably better adjusted than the people who freak out over them (it's just a book, you lunatics!).<br /><br />Nope, this probably isn't the best book for your very young early-alphabet learning children, but if you have a relatively healthy-minded 7 or 8 year old, chances are they'll find this book as hilarious as you do.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I still love this record after scooping it from the shelves with childish glee (I only have this feeling when picking up new Korn releases). Since the reviews above and below articulate the merits of this unique effort better than I can, I'll just put it like this: if you liked \\"Untouchables\\", you will LOVE SYOTOS. In fact, I see this as the logical progression of Untouchables' sound since the band only went a step backward with 2003's \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\".     The chief benefit of SYOTOS is that it loses some of the tedious anchors that weighed them down on their previous release (over-the-top anger, a useless guest rapper, and mostly tired lyrics), tinkers and improves upon the gems that made \\"Untouchables\\" such a promising record (Goth undertones, creepy ballads and heavy, easy to digest hooks) and reintroduces new (and old) elements such as a glass armonica, piano, violins, creepy samples and *drum roll* the bagpipe (!).    It is extremely obvious that Korn put their noses to the grindstone in the wake of Head's departure and took their time to craft a refreshing, not to mention f***ing awesome companion to \\"Untouchables\\". I won't say it's their best album because their discography is comprised of different moods and styles, but it's safe to announce that Jonathan Davis and company have delivered on every promise they made before this record was unleashed on the lovers and skeptics. Hopefully others will continue to embrace the ever-changing climate of kick-assery that is Korn with SYOTOS as their flagship.
B000003TA4|3.0|First of all.  Nirvana probably wouldn't be much of an issue today if Kurt didn't blow his brains out.  I think that if Pearl Jam's frontman killed himself instead of Kurt then you would see a million Eddie Vedar shirts and Nirva would be where Pearl Jam is at right now. (Not all that great)   <br />But I'm not trying to take anything away from Nirvana.  They were good.  But just because Kurt wimped out and killed himself doesn't mean we have to hear their songs 11 years later every second of the day.  Their not that great.  No one would care about them if he was still alive.  So lets drop this whole worship the dead thing and move on with our lives. <br /> <br />P.S.  I'd probably kill myself if I were married to Courtney Love too.
0553801503|4.0|Just about everyone was either insanely disgusted and gave it a 1, or they swear that nothing George writes could ever earn less than a 5. I'm going with a \\"4\\" to represent that it was one of the best books I've read this year, but not quite on par with the 5-star perfection of the previous three books.<br /><br />Jon, Bran, Dany, Stannis, the Onion Knight, and my favorite- Tyrion, were all on standby this time around. After a long five-year wait, I gotta admit that this irked me a bit. I got over it. Their tale could be here within a year if all goes as planned, and Feast's line up provided some enjoyable story-telling. I will now cover each main character from least favorite on up. (even the least was still good reading)<br /><br />-Sam the Slayer. In my opinion, Sam should not have been made a viewpoint character to begin with. He is simply too hard to identify with, and I certainly didn't buy his \\"relationship\\" in this book. He's a funny character, and smart, and it is fun to see him finding himself, but not as a main character here.<br /><br />-The Iron Men. This whole section could have been trimmed quite a bit between the various viewpoint characters and drawn out chapters. We're still waiting for Theon to reappear, but the other characters from this part of the world didn't impress. George could have summed up their story with one chapter and maybe some news from the ravens. The end result, however, I do like the problem they now present for Westeros.<br /><br />-Arya Stark. I found her pretty enjoyable in the other books, because a lot happened to her AND during her chapters. I think I often liked the characters she encountered more than Arya, herself- especially The Hound, and Beric Dondarrion. She was a great character, but here, it was as if George was simply trying to remind us that she was still alive, while all the other stuff was happening back home. There was really no progress with her character, and nothing interesting happened. Furthermore, the fact that she is in Braavos reminds me that we could really use a map showing where she and Dany are. These lands have been involved in the story for four books now, and I can't figure out where they are in relation to the rest of the world.<br /><br />-The Land of Dorne. Again, we have several different new viewpoint characters each with their own chapters. While I enjoyed seeing the last of the Seven Kingdoms finally revealed, the plot of these chapters could also have been summed up nicely in a single chapter and some news from the ravens.<br /><br />-Sansa Stark. Until the end of the last book, I couldn't stand Sansa (Caitlyn either), but because her chapters now involve Littlefinger, I find them rather enjoyable. He is proving to be one devious little you-know-what! He has a master plan, and he really knows how to make everyone fit into his game, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how that game will end up! I wouldn't mind if little Robyn missed a step on a tall staircase though- You know its coming!<br /><br />-Queen Cersi. The Queen was a little bit rattled in the beginning of this book, but she gets her stride back as the story goes on. Like Littlefinger, she is an avid player in the Game of Thrones, moving people against one another to help her rise to the top of the heap. What can I say? I like this type of character, even though they never win in the end, do they? Here she plays the unofficial role of King's Hand, and just like with the previous three Hands, we are right in the thick of it, with lots of intrigue. I certainly didn't expect her chapters to end the way they did- Great stuff!<br /><br />-Brienne. The Maid of Tarth made for an excellent viewpoint character, and I certainly enjoyed her tale here. With her new squire and her adventures far away from the game of thrones, her chapters reminded me of Dunk and Egg, from George's Hedge Knight stories, which were set a century or so before this. This was certainly not a bad thing, as it was SerDuncan the Tall that got me hooked on Martin.<br /><br />-Jamie. The Kingslayer was my favorite character here. He was an imposing villain back at the beginning, and his one-eighty into a character most of us can root for, is nothing short of brilliant. He is the most human character in the book, as he is beginning to see everything and everyone as they truly are, yet he still has his duty- to serve a kingdom and family he no longer respects. I can't wait to see where his revelations take him.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Feast, was that none of the main characters encountered each other. They just all went their own way as if it were seven separate stories. Sure Jaime and Cersi and Brienne started out in King's Landing, but then they each went their individual ways. Same with Sam when he left Jon at the Wall. I thought it could have proved interesting when Sam and Arya ran into each other, but neither of them mentioned Jon Snow, and they both went their own way with a ho-hum.<br /><br />Another problem I had with Feast was some of George's throwaway characters. In Storm of Swords, the Hound and the Mountain, and Berric Dondarrion were great! I started reading, and I couldn't wait for them to make their appearances in Feast, but no... I still can't believe George didn't use them at all. It was as if the actors who played them didn't renew their contracts. What a bummer.<br /><br />Overall, Feast had some very enjoyable writing, but in my opinion, the whole story didn't progress much. He mopped up most of the mess from the first wave of war, and set the pieces up for wave two. Which is fine, but the entire next book will be more of the same, only with the other half of the cast. So I think I am more looking forward to the book after the next. That is where I predict the s--- will hit the fan again, the way we like it. But how long must we wait for that?<br /><br />***One final opinion... The new covers need to go.Kingslayer was my favorite character here.

0688156819|4.0|Most people are familiar with Edward Gorey's work, even if they don't know it: The Gashlycrumb Tinies is that twisted little alphabet book for grown-ups: A is for Amy who fell down the stairs, B is for Basil, assaulted by bears... and so on.  Gorey is truly the king of gallows humor.<br /><br />Tim Burton has followed carefully and respectfully in Gorey's footsteps in everything he's done, from his movies to this hilarious little poetry book.  Yep, it's kind of twisted, but most healthy and well-adjusted kids (aged 7 and up is probably a good guideline) will be able to appreciate the dark humor as much as you do.  Get this book, you'll be glad you did, but if you don't own any of Gorey's books, get one of those, too, and you'll be able to quite clearly see the influence.
B0001KZM3O|2.0|(2.5 stars really)<br /><br />This was my fifth Pink Floyd album after the amazing Meddle, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here and The Wall. \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\", \\"The Gunners Dream\\", \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" are good enough to salvage an otherwise unremarkable and seemingly directionless album.<br /><br />Yes, I was deeply disappointed with this when I first heard it, but now I realize that this isn't typical of Roger Waters' and his way of controlling the band at the time (Yes, this is practically a solo effort). Floyd fans should get it for the bright spots, but somehow this piece belongs in the catalogue of completionists only. Bold statement? Well, I'm talking through a Pink Floyd-point of view, not Waters. This certainly qualified for the next-coming Floyd album as well (A Momentary Lapse Of Reason) after Water's departure, but that's another story.<br /><br />People claim this to be \\"the last true Floyd-album\\". That I don't agree with. Waters was largely focusing on one thing and one thing only: Himself. Surely it would've made a nice addition to his solo career instead of connecting the Floyd banner to it. However, I don't want you to get me all wrong. This being a solo effort doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad record. The lyrics are occasionally good but I was always one to enjoy the amazing blend of Floyd's lyrics (Dark Side...) along with a fantastic, spacy sound (Meddle). Clearly this record lacks the latter.
B00003CXAW|5.0|The original King Kong is now available on DVD. It's amazing how a 70 year old film continues to grab the attention of fans across the world, with a remake of the movie hitting theaters in December 2005. Anyone who sees the remake should take it upon themselves to see the original. <br /> <br />This King Kong DVD is a 2-disc special edition item. Disc 1 contains the film which, amazingly, has been remastered into decent quality black-and-white. The movie follows the exploits of Carl Denham, a greedy movie director from New York, who leads a film crew to secluded Skull Island. The Americans quickly find out that Skull Island is a land inhabitated by giant prehistoric creatures, the most impressive of which is a 60-foot gorilla (Kong) whom is routinely offered human sacrices by the people of the island to keep him at bay. Kong falls in love with a blonde female who is traveling with Denham's crew, and after being transported back to New York and escaping from captivity, the gorilla goes berserk looking for her...all of which leads to a climactic showdown atop the Empire State Building. <br /> <br />King Kong has some of the most impressive special effects you will ever see on film. This is all the more spectacular considering that the movie was made in 1933 - well before the age of computer animation and high-tech cameras. Kong himself was an amazing accomplishment, along with the other dinosaurs and giant snakes. The fights between Kong and his dinosaur enemies look very real, and in many ways, appear much more authentic than the computer-generated graphics of today. <br /> <br />Disc 2 contains special features. One is a documentary on the director, and the other is an 8-part documentary on the filming of King Kong. This documentary is extremely in-depth and focuses on everything from the writing of the storyline, to the special effects and designing of the creatures, to the censoring of certain scenes and this lost footage of the Giant Spider scene mid-way throughthe film, and the impact and legacy of King Kong. <br /> <br />King Kong's lasting legacy can be seen in films such as Mighty Joe Young and Planet of the Apes, and in video games such as Donkey Kong and Rampage (Rampage is a blatant King Kong rip off, as the main character is an over-sized gorilla who goes about destroying cities and eating humans). <br /> <br />King Kong is one of the greatest movies of all-time.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|My feelings for this record are coloured by the fact that I first heard it in the coach on a school history trip to the Normandy beaches and war memorials in northern France. Pink Floyd taught me so much more about WW2 on that trip than any of the teachers did. It's an astonishingly heart-felt and sensitive recording. <br /> <br />There are plenty of good reviews already posted about the Final Cut - but I just had to add that in my opinion David Gilmour's guitar solos on this record are some of the best he ever recorded with Waters-era Pink Floyd. They are a brilliant display of power, taste and restraint. <br /> <br />
B000003S5H|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best Air album. It combines the excellent beats and basslines of Premiere Symptomes with some great guest vocals. <br /> <br />I can listen to this over and over. Great for chilling out, having a dinner party, or listening to on the plane.
B000001GXE|5.0|I gave Carlos Kleiber's 1978 recording of Schubert's \\"Unfinished\\" and 3rd (D Major) Symphonies 5 stars, but this is definitely for Kleiber's fans: and more about Kleiber than Schubert.  Carlos Kleiber has become a cult figure with almost pop star following among music lovers the world over, largely because of his very small discography and frequent cancellations of live performances the last 20 years of his life.  There is a certain mystery about Kleiber, and more is pondered about what he DIDN'T DO, as what he DID, both in recordings and live performances.<br /><br />Carlos Kleiber (1930-2004) recorded these Schubert Symphonies 3 and 8 with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1978 for DG.  The recorded sound is excellent, and the Vienna musicians play like angels.  But be warned: in Symphony 3, the allegros are really FAST, and sound rather hasty after awhile.  The Allegro section of I and IV sounds almost brutal, and as though Kleiber wanted to get through it as fast as possible.  II is also the quickest I have ever heard, and is over with in just over 2 minutes.  III, the Minuet, is also very fast: not for those who like Beecham and Bohm, with a slower, more stately minuet.<br /><br />Symphony 8 is more in the mainstream, but lacks the intensity of Bruno Walter (Sony), Solti/Vienna (Decca), Bohm/Berlin (DG) or Bernstein/Concertgebouw (DG).  Even though there is nothing wrong with Kleiber's interpretation, somehow this seems lacking compared with the above greater recordings.<br /><br />So, if you are a Carlos Kleiber fan and want all his recordings (and there aren't alot of them) this is for you.  If you are more interested in the best recordings of Schubert, go for Bohm/Berlin (DG), Beecham/Royal Philharmonic (EMI), Halasz/Failoni Orchestra (Naxos) for Symphony 3; or Walter/New York (Sony) or Bernstein/Concertgebouw (DG) for Symphony 8.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Wow, I'm so glad I discovered this CD.  It's one of those goodies that just gets better and better upon repeated listens.  I'd never heard of Stevens before hearing \\"Chicago\\" on a satellite radio station.  On the strength of that song, I purchased the CD.  The music reminds me a bit of Polyphonic Spree in that Stevens seems to use whatever is available with his rudimentary skill at playing same to make this gorgeous music.  What he might lack in musical skill or sophistication of recording equipment, he makes up in his storytelling ability, his expressive and sweet voice and his obvious passion for the stories.  It's no surprise to read that he earned a Masters in creative writing.  As corny as it sounds, all the reviews in which the strains of his Christian faith in his music are mentioned, has brought to mind the Biblical admonition to \\"make a joyful noise (sound?)\\".  To the delight of his listeners, Stevens obviously takes this to heart.

0441003257|5.0|This book is an excellent collaboration between the comedy/fantasy writer Terry Pratchett and the great Scifi/Fantasy/Mythology writer Neil Gaiman. The story is about how the Son of Satan got mixed up at birth and includes many figures from Christian mythology - angels, demons, even the four horsemen of the Apocalypse but is up to the unlikely team of a demon and an angel to prevent the end of the world. <br /> <br />Very funny read - written in the same style of British humor as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Pratchett's Discworld series of novels - and Gaiman is the expert in creating modern personas for mythological characters and creatures. I really hope these guys team up again!
B00006AW2M|4.0|O.K. O.K. so this wasn't the best Stones album ever made. O.K. O.K. they were playing \\"Keeping Up With the Beatles\\" as if they really lived in \\"Another Land\\" that Bill Wyman warned about.  We forget our rock icons are, after all, human. If you can seperate the excessive noise for noise sake (possibly Brian Jones unleashed) and concentrate on the songs, there are quite a few likeable ones here. I do not know how wise it was to record Brian snoring in the studio and put it on record(awful!), however, in the old days of L.P.s children- if you put the musical exit of \\"Sing this All Together (See What Happens) on 45 rpm, you would be treated to the tune \\"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\\" done in a way only the Stones would dare to do. These are little tidbits that you pick up in life and probably have no use for - unless, of course, you go on Jeopardy and they try to blindside you! Citadel,2000 Man,She's a Rainbow, 2000 Light Years from Home - all accessible Stones. So this was fun for awhile. Thankfully, they (and the Beatles I might add) gave excessive psychedelia up and got back into a superb groove with Beggar's Banquet. Should you get this? Well, looking at this as a rock history artifact (with The Beatles \\"hidden\\" in the front photograph), I would say yes. If all that doesn't interest you get the classic Let It Bleed or unjustifiably under-rated and one-of-a-kind Between the Buttons.<br /><br />Sorry Mick - I just can't give you 5 stars on this one.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|When I first found out that Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novel series was going to be adapted for the big screen, I was both excited and concerned at the same time, at what could come out of it. The books were so unique, even for the comic book medium, that I knew they would be tough to adapt on film. When I saw the film's opening sequence in the theater  all of my concerns were put to rest, and I knew I was in for one heck of a ride. The end result is one of the most faithful films to its source material in the comic to movie genre ever made. <br /> <br />Director Robert Rodriguez asked Miller himself to co-direct the film which loosely connects three of the series best stories. It leads off and ends though with a short vignette called The Customer Is Always Right, with Josh Hartnett as The Man. This helps to set the tone at the start, as well as put on a proper coda for the movie.  <br /> <br />The Hard Goodbye--Tortured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke) is framed for murder and he turns to his parole officer Luc (Carla Gugino) for help. Even as he forced to go it alone in the end. What he finds out is both unsettling and brilliant at the same time.  <br /> <br />The Big Fat Kill follows Dwight (Clive Owen) and what happens when he enters into a casual relationship with a waitress named Shellie (Brittany Murphy). Little does he know that he's about to put in the middle of a struggle for power over the red light district that forces him to do some wild things. During this segment of the film special guest director Quentin Tarantino was asked to helm a scene. While I am not a Tarantino fan by any means, I appreciate his work on this film, and his friendship with Rodriguez.  <br /> <br />That Yellow Bastard Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a rare honest cop in Sin City. Even as he prepares to retire, he will stop at nothing to put an end to a child molester's reign of terror, no matter how well connected the sewer rat might be. In order to have justice for the victims, Hartigan will sacrifice a lot, especially when his life becomes intertwined with victim Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba). When Hartigan's investigation takes him right to the vile Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl) himself, forcing him to discover just how far he's he's willing to go.  <br /> <br />Using green screen effects and CGI, Rodriguez was able to bring Sin City to life without really needing to tamper with the look and style of the books themselves. The results are dazzling. The true success though really has to do with Miller's characters and the way Rodriguez doesn't alter them to make them more Hollywood. The performances from the cast are first rate and help sell everything else. I have been critical of CGI/Green Screen flicks like Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow, whose characters let the film's tech look overtake it, but here, the tech acts to serve the characters--not vice versa. Like the books, the noir flavor shine through, while allowing for a dash of licence.  <br /> <br />Disc One includes the original theatrical cut of the film and these extras. A feature length audio commentary with Rodriguez and Miller, a second audio commentary with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Bruce Willis, and a third audio track featuring audience reaction at the premiere in Austin. The commentaries give you a well rounded look at how things came together, from both a creative standpoint and actor perspective. The reaction track is a hoot and worth a listen as you watch the film. There's also a series of featurettes on everything from Miller and Tarantino, to the film's cars, props, make-up effects and costumes. Some of the info from these can also be heard on the commentaries...that said they are worth watching. An interactive character time line and the theatrical trailers top off the disc.  <br /> <br />Disc Two includes an extended cut of each story--treating them more like separate short films---rather than a whole with a few connective threads. Some of the \\"new\\" footage is just incidental stuff. But there's some meaty additions in That Yellow Bastard and The Hard Goodbye that fans should like. Three more featurettes focus on how Rodriguez brought the film to life. Focusing on the CGI effects, a high-speed green screen only version of the movie, and a 14 minute uninterrupted take of the Tarantino scene. These are for die hard fans only. You'll also see what it was like at the wrap party with cast and crew. And wrapping up the second disc, you can learn how to make Sin City breakfast tacos (??!), yummmmm. <br /> <br />The package also includes a paperback copy of The Hard Goodbye... Sin City is a great film, no matter which way you decide to watch it, and the 2 disc DVD is well worth it.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|In the midst of the Great Depression, Carl Denham ( Black ) is hard-up for an actress for his newest picture. Enter Ann Darrow ( Watts ), a wide-eyed ingenue starving for a role and a meal. Denham convinces her to set sail with his crew to Singapore, for the role of a lifetime. Unknown to the cast and crew, the real destination of their vessel is far from Singapore. Along for the ride are Bruce Baxter, an insufferable pompous actor, and Jack Driscoll ( Brody ), brooding playwright extraordinaire and the object of Ann's affection. Once they reach the filming location, they soon realize that an ill-fated movie is the least of their problems. <br /> <br />I absolutely loved this movie. I consider it a classic, right alongside the original. Peter Jackson is one of the best directors out there, and you can tell his love of film in the way he has preserved the suspense and mystery in the legend of Kong. The opening alone sold me. Jackson didn't dive right into the action, but let you into the cold and fledging world of Darrow, so you felt for her every hardship. A lot of the dialogue is the same as the original, and the insect sequence, which was missing from the 1933 version due to budget cuts, is there, in all its squeamish glory. The casting is terrific, especially Watts, who although she must spend the entire movie screaming, gives it her all in every pout. Also worth noting is Jack Black, who proves himself able to do more than slapstick, in the role of a overconfident and overambitious director. But the true star of the movie is Kong, a behemoth of a gorilla, who stirs a multitude of emotion in the audience, with nothing more than a single growl.  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Before this year, I'd never heard of 'Firefly' or 'Serneity', until my Dad bought the 'Firefly' series and we spent the next month and a half watching 'em over and over again. My view on that: <br />FANTASTIC <br />When I saw Sernity, the Reavers, battles and humour were brilliant. The loss of two brilliant characters - for those who haven't seen it, I won't say who - was upsetting and Mal's rather harsh way of getting his plans across left me somewhat... awestruck. An unexpected ending filled with blood, suspense at every bend, I strongly recommend this for everyone, even if you din't like the series, you'll love the movie.

B000AYEIZY|1.0|This is a really bad, lackluster performance. The songs are barely recognizable without the energy that these guys exuded in their heyday. Clapton's guitar playing completely lacks enthusiasm as does the entire performance. If I'd been there, I'd have fallen asleep. Their age is no excuse for this. The Stones are just as old and exhibit more enthusiasm. Hell, B.B. King, at 80, rocks stronger than these guys! Sounds as if they'd rather have been somewhere else, and probably should have been.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is a well-kept secret.  I had the pleasure of seeing him in concert last night in Buffalo, NY. He shared the concert with Click 5, Lifehouse, PussyCat Dolls, and the big headliner Ryan Cabrera.  Gavin outshone them all, even though he only got to perform six songs.  He has amazing talent...singing, piano and guitar..and his songwriting is astounding. The was not one boring note in any of the songs he performed last night.  Chariot and I Don't Wanna Be will be all-time classics. Check out his lyrics on line first...they are refreshing and beautiful for such a young soul.  His secret is that he is not after success #1, just being true to his music.  His performance was boundless and full of joy and energy...he is a real \\"HAM\\", but if you have the talent to back up your onstage antics, well then you've got a real star.  Trust me...I've been to plenty of concerts in my 51 years and seen a whole myriad of musicians/singers; and Gavin is in the top all-time TEN.  I am NOT exaggerating!! I am RUNNING out to buy his CD. If he ever comes to your area, don't miss him.  And of course you should bring anyone who appreciates REAL talent, and of course, any female who appreciates a cute boy!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I'm going to attempt to be more objective about \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\", Madonna's tenth album of original material (excluding the Dick Tracy soundtrack). Rather than blindly lavish this album with praise, I want to take a more critical approach to the music. This, along with 1992's \\"Erotica\\" and 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\" has to be one of her weaker efforts both musically and lyrically. She returns to her dance roots much like the music found on her debut from 1983. However, the biggest difference between her debut and \\"Confessions\\" is that her debut was loaded with memorable hits like \\"Holiday\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Burning Up\\". The music and lyrics on her debut were lightweight, but she had something interesting to offer back then. Now, at age 47, mother of two, married, millionairess and children's book author, Madonna seems uninspired. Why not? At 47, it's time to get serious, which is what she did on her excellent, but lambasted 2003 effort \\"American Life\\". I disagree with nearly everyone else who's written a review here. Her past two efforts are better than this, and nothing has even come close to the classic 1989 album \\"Like A Prayer\\".<br /><br />So, are there hits here? Yes. \\"Hung Up\\" borrowing from Abba's classic \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" works very well as the first single. It's memorable and catchy. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is also memorable along with \\"Push\\". After that, there are more generic, but somewhat memorable tracks like \\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"How High\\" and \\"Like It Or Not\\". This brings me to the next problem with \\"Confessions\\". It's length. It's too long, and like her debut, it would have benefitted from brevity. You could easily leave off the tracks \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"I Love New York\\", \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Isaac\\", and you would have a tight, concise album with no filler.<br /><br />I like Madonna's music (though I don't know if I'd say the same about her as a person), and I have all ten of her studio albums plus a couple of her compilations. It just seems that while \\"Confessions\\" may be danceable and fun, it's not very memorable or interesting. \\"American Life\\" had some interesting tracks like the title track, \\"Mother And Father\\", \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Die Another Day\\" and more, and the music was more varied and experimental. \\"Confessions\\" is derivative, I mean I recognized beats and rhythms from Donna Summer, Abba, Eiffel 65, Depeche Mode, Cher and others. This is not Madonna's shining moment, and I hope with her next album she returns to more experimental and interesting topics.<br /><br />My final verdict is that this album is average Madonna. Not her best, not her worst, just somewhere in the middle.ms plus a couple of her compilations.

B00005JO1Y|1.0|There seems to be a cult of the personality surrounding Mr Jackson; some fans actually describing him as their `beloved'. Certainly, the three hour plus running time practically screams: \\"I'm an auteur. Respect me.\\"    Remember the days when men were men in the movies? Burton paired with Eastwood. Lee Marvin in anything. Jackson's art-house pretensions to deconstruct masculinity works against an adventure narrative. I'm surprised Kong even had any hair on him. The captain or first mate of the original 1933 production is relegated to a supporting role and is tainted with colonialist ambivalence and shiftiness. He is even given a ticking off by 'beauty' for having the temerity to try to rescue her (at the expense of many male and therefore worthless lives.) Her `other' suitor is now an introverted writer whom the director doesn't even know what to do with in the final act in New York. His search for the hero inside himself leaves us scratching our heads as we're not entirely sure what he is trying to do in that car. This is followed by a bizarre non-rescue of the heroine. Kong himself is emasculated to the point where he has to hide behind the skirts of a women as she defends her helpless hirsute boyfriend against the rat-a-tat fire of bourgeois society (and by implication us for the \\"price of a ticket.\\") Beastiality, it seems, is the only refuge from a venal world of weak men and rough traders. Even a cabin boys rite of passage is pointedly allowed to go nowhere. Curiously, in one shot on the island, Jackson shows Darrow staring at Denham, as if to imply she views the impresario as the urban doppelganger of Kong, driven by obsession. In which case, if they are one and the same, why did she dump Denham on the return to New York only to take up with Kong anyway? Clearly, this was not self sacrifice to save others under threat. She is besotted with the beast to a degree that is unsavoury, not to mention frequently ridiculous. The suspense of the original, that is, willbeauty escape the ferocious beast, is dispensed with resulting in a limp conclusion.     In the final quarter, Jackson seems to be striving for the poetic with the internal monologue of his sissy suitor but the material doesn't countenance it. The real poetry resides in the final line but as Beauty has obviously spent the picture trying to save Kong and Jackson has been pointing the finger of blame at everyone else, including the audience, it lacks resonance. Kong is the second Aslan of the month, crucified for our sins. I preferred the unreconstructed chauvinist of the original. He was a bit of a `jerk', but a lot more fun. Curiously, Jackson's message is far more reactionary than the original's. Don't take no for an answer, slap her about a bit and you'll win fair maiden's heart. Besides, isn't all this revisionism and finger wagging at false male values a tad hypocritical amongst all the drawn out fight sequences, which are little more than adverts for the video game version appealing to the testosterone in teenage boys?    Just where is the fun meant to be here? Can't men just be men anymore? America was built on the pioneer spirit after all. Cynics might say it was built on racism, genocide and exploitation but it really wouldn't hurt to have an adventure story with a little less ambivalence in the trouser department. History is littered with charismatic explorers.    Kong `nicely' rounds off a wretched year for film. Faced with this pretentious, bloated, badly directed and violent bore, we return to Conrad in a way perhaps not intended by the film-makers with a plaintive cry of: \\"the horror! The horror!\\" followed in quick succession by the more personal, \\"when the hell is it all going to end?\\"
B00005JOFO|2.0|There's nothing outstanding in this film.  Nothing that makes it better than all the other movies that explore the concept of forbidden love.  This film's praise is propelled by the fact that the characters are gay.  Oooh.  Groundbreaking.  This movie wasn't horrible.  But it was by no means great either. <br /> <br />I think King Kong did a better job of conveying the elements of forbidden love.  And it didn't need homosexuality either.
0553260111|5.0|When i was reading the book i started to think that the book was 100% better than the movie.  Even though Matt Damon is a great actor, but i still would have to say, read the book. <br /> <br />This was my first Robert Ludlum novel.  During the book i kept thinking whats gong to happen next.  He is one of those authors where you can not put the book down or else you have to start over. <br /> <br />Luldum started off with a lot of detail.  In the beginning Jason Bourne woke up from his comma in a doctors office because he got shot in the head by a bullet in the Medatarian Sea and did not know where he was or what his name was.  The doctor found out there was a microfilm with a Swiss bank account.  Also he realizes that he speaks three different languages.  then later on he finds out that he is very deadly with hand to hand combat.  that is just the begining. <br /> <br />the only complaint i have even though there were barely any, is that i do not know why Ludlum would have Borne shot so many times and never dies or really stops and gets caught. like he just takes a bullet and thats it.  but other why's this book is amazing.  i really like this a lot.  i would recommend this to anyone who loves action novels.  i read to the late night and my girlfriend was not to happy because i was to busy reading the book and not talking to her.  it is one of those books where you are part of it and that when you are done at 3 in the morning you have dreams about it in your sleep and you can not wait to come home from school and work to read more and find out more.  like i said before what a book and that i would recommend it to anyone that loves action novels.

B00005Y7NK|2.0|I've read tons of reviews saying how \\"heavy\\" this album is and how it's easily the best album of the Tony Martin era of Sabbath for beginners. <br /> <br />What a load of crap! <br /> <br />The album suffers from several factors. First of all, its keyboard-drenched 80's production, thin guitar tone and overly prominent vocals kill any chance the songs had of displaying any kind of heaviness or atmosphere. Tony Martin is certainly a capable vocalist, falling somewhere between Ronnie James Dio and Fates Warning singer Ray Alder in terms of vocal range and tone. However, previous Sabbath vocalists were unique, stood out and had a part in making the music unique and vibrant. Martin does none of this, he just belts out high note after high note of pseudo-Satanic imagery over campy pseudo-hair metal. <br />  <br />Gone are the memorable riffs of songs like Sweet Leaf, Symptom of the Universe, Heaven and Hell and Zero the Hero. Iommi seems content to churn out generic guitar lines over boring, overproduced drum beats and tonally thin bass lines. This is Black Sabbath only in name, it fails to capture the spirit of excitement and dread that the best Sabbath recordings conjure up. <br /> <br />However, I will say that Iommi's lead playing has improved by leaps and bounds, and his solos, as always, are a treat to listen to.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club - funny, cynical, satirical, a bit violent.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|With ticket prices in California being as ridiculous as they are, and today's movie audiences having completely forsaken manners, it takes a lot to get me into a theater these days. The lure of King Kong, and Peter Jackson's ability as a director was enough to convince me to go. Naturally, I was surrounded by people who didn't give a damn that other people were trying to enjoy the movie, but what else is new? Anyway this is a review of King Kong, not the audience. <br /> <br />I won't go into a summary of the plot, there are reviews ahead of mine that already take the time, and I think most people remember the classic storyline of the giant ape on the mysterious island. Of the some sixty reviews posted before mine, only two haters have crawled from under their rocks to post their self-important, irrelevant crap--- because everybody else loved King Kong and they'll rage against anything popular, unlike themselves. So sad... Anyway, only two pathetic haters so far, which I think may be a record for Amazon, and perhaps the internet as a whole. <br /> <br />I've read reviews here--- people cried, they screamed--- on the way to the theater the DJ spinning the tunes on the radio mentioned that a girlfriend of hers said the remake of King Kong \\"changed her life\\". So there were high expectations from the word \\"go\\". King Kong lived up to all of it, and exceeded my expectations by a lot, though my standard of living hasn't changed. <br /> <br />This being a Peter Jackson film, it took its time. The film runs a smidge over three hours, and it does take a while to get legs under it, but once it does the action hardly stops. This island has worse things than Kong, and from the moment our characters set foot on it there are fierce creatures looking to add them to their menu. The least hostile monster on the island is the vegetarian Kong, who is won over by beauty and comedy, and trust me when I say Kong has no shortage of hostility. Naomi Watts' character makes Kong laugh. Judging by his facial expressions and demeanor he is a very lonely and sad giant ape.  <br /> <br />In spite of being shaken nearly to death like a rag doll in his massive grip, she manages to befriend him. Kong then becomes her protector for the rest of the film. The other characters should be so lucky. <br /> <br />What I thought was ironic was that Kong and Adrien Brody's character are both looking out for the girl's safety. Even in New York, you get the sense that Kong is trying to rescue the girl and keep her safe and both the man and the ape pay for their love--- the ape most of all.  <br /> <br />A sequence of the movie where the men looking for the girl are running among a herd of stampeding Brontosauruses--- stampeding because they are being attacked by hunting raptor-like beasts. People get stomped, and action scenes which always start simply, snowball into worse situations for them. It's not enough that they are dodging the massive feet of giant dinosaurs; when that begins to get stale PJ gives them raptors to deal with, and when that begins to show wear, they are driven to the edge of a cliff, and the ground crumbles beneath them. It gets worse and worse, one damned thing after another. <br /> <br />The same goes for Naomi and her new boyfriend. You've seen the trailer. You know Kong fights a T-Rex, but believe me when I tell you, you ain't seen nothing. That little snip from the trailer where Kong grabs the T-rex by the jaws doesn't even come close to preparing you for the battle they have.  <br /> <br />It was simply awesome. And the poor girl is caught between them, the whole time in grave danger. The monsters want to eat her so badly I'm convinced that she must have smelled wonderful. The men trying to save her has problems too; bigger problems. The most disturbing sequence of the film is when they are attacked by giant insects. I mean talk about the willies. I almost closed my eyes I was so horrified by what I saw.  <br /> <br />These bugs are utterly convincing as they spring on top of their prey, trying to bite heads, legs--- remember Starship Troopers? Forget it. These bugs are giant versions of real ones. Potato bugs, millipedes, spiders and giant tube wormy looking things that are slimy and disgusting. Are people eaten? No. They are devoured and anyone who watches the National Geographic channel or \\"Wild Discovery\\" knows how insects eat and can picture in their minds what I'm trying to warn you about. It's like I said before--- on that island they are not safe for one second, and the bugs will be a part I plan on skipping when I own this on dvd. It's horrifying. <br /> <br />Seeing everything that Kong has to contend with on this island, and knowing that he too is a survivor of that place--- New York is in deep trouble, but Kong is in bigger trouble. For Kong I imagine New York being the \\"lost land\\" filled with hostility. There, for all the havoc he causes, he is at the disadvantage, and that's something that wasn't really made clear in the other Kong films. When Kong goes berserk and tears apart the city looking for his girl, I was rooting for him as much as I was rooting for the men on the island trying against the odds to save the her from Kong. <br /> <br />The complaints I have about King Kong, is that while I know it was important to show King Kong as sympathetic, a likeable character with a personality, I almost ODed on how sad he is. When he's not fighting monsters, \\"awwww look at how sweet he is\\". That's fine and dandy, but towards the end I got to thinking \\"Okay, we know he's sad and lonely. We know he is a victim as much as he is a menace. Rope it in, and let's see some rampage.\\" And the rampage was somewhat disappointing. I think they may have taken too much time on the island, and not enough in New York, but that's just my opinion.  <br /> <br />The movie was intense, with fabulous action. Once you get over the 45 minute hurdle at the beginning you forget how long PJ took to get you there, and you're longing for them to get off that island to safety because it doesn't slow down (except to show us how sad Kong is). <br /> <br />King Kong is thrilling, exciting with the right blend of humor, drama and action. Peter Jackson took a classic and made it even more so. Many thanks for reading my worthless opinion and I hope it helped a little.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Forget about substance and meaning.  It's all about the fetish clothing and wu xia kung fu choreography.  There are a few moments with symbolic meaning and a bit of eye candy, but overall it's very bland.

Two stars for being an improvement over the sequel, and for the night club scene.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|In the last decade, I've grown weary of going to the theater to see new movies. There is always some jerk talking on their phone, or children that are inappropriately aged for the material crying or complaining the entire time. Instead, I enjoy watching movies at home. But as with any DVD addict, you're always looking for something else. Something new to watch. That's how I found The Butterfly Effect. <br /> <br />After several of my friends swore by it, I just went ahead and bought it, and am I glad I did because this will be one movie I'll watch 1,000 times over. I was completely riveted. What I loved most was that with every time he tried to change the outcome, the characters interacted differently. Ashton's goth roommate was his friend once, and then when he goes and changes his past, it's as though they were never friends. I really enjoyed that each actor had the chance to play a different version of their characters. This is an incredible and very well done movie you won't regret watching at least once, but I suspect you'll want to watch it again and again.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Spoilers: <br /> <br />In the film The Longest Yard, the name Mean Machine represents love and power because their friend the caretaker gave the football team that name and because they wanted to win the game for the caretaker who was killed at the prison. <br />I did not know a lot about the film. All I knew was that it was a football movie and staring in the movie was Adam Sandler, Nelly who is a rap singer, and some professional wrestlers. I also knew that it was mostly taking place at a prison somewhere. <br />A thing that I learned from the film that actually might be of some use to me some day is that in a prison if you want to get along you have to go along. The warden used this phrase in the film. In a prison, you also have to trust yourself and no one else because if you go along with the wrong thing instead of saying no, your sentence might be extended. Crew learned this in the film because the warden was trying to get him to throw the game or shave points. He had already done that before, but if he didn't do it, the warden was going to pin the caretakers' death on him. Crew knew that things would work out all right so he still won the game. <br />Because one of the other inmates who were on the guards' side killed the caretaker, AKA half a star, the players gave their love to the caretaker. The caretaker gave the team uniforms with the name Mean Machine on them, which they all received just before the game against the guards. Caretaker wanted to be there to see the looks on his teammate's faces but he could not because of the way things happened. This is why the phrase Mean Machine showed love. Love was given to the caretaker for all of the things that he did for each one of the players on the football team. <br />And <br />Because they all thought they were not going to win, until they remembered their friend, the caretaker, and what he did for them. Therefore, they got their heads up and all of the players got tons of pumping adrenalin power just beforethe game. They knew that they were going to get back at the guards for the way that they had treated them and what they did to their friend before at the prison. It turned out that they did have enough power and pride to beat the guards. I believe that the name of the team gave them power because they knew that they didn't have to only win it for themselves, but mostly for the person who encouraged them the whole way through training and who gave them uniforms and a name to make them all a real team; this person was the caretaker. <br />Further more; the events that took place in the movie convinced Crew (Adam Sandler) that he could not shave points twice in his life off a football game. He had a feeling that he was going to be with the rest of the team a lot longer because the warden was going to extend his sentence if he did not loose the game. They all became a family and they won the game. <br />I wonder if they will have a sequel to this movie like a second season between the <br />guards and the inmates. <br />
0974872407|5.0|Lei la novela el pasado verano, durante un viaje.  Encontre que fue una excelente esperiencia. Carlos Ruiz Zafon puso en palabras lo que experimento cada vez que habro un buen libro y lo leo hasta el final sin parar. El personaje principal me llevo a traves de la fantasia que toda persona busca cada vez que encuentra un buen libro; el ser parte del mismo. Esto es asi, porque el autor dedico todas estas paginas a crear la historia de una persona que no se conforma con tan solo leer el libro sino, que busca la procedencia del mismo. Un muy pequeo nio que tras la perdida de su madre a temprana edad encuentra en una vieja biblioteca una nueva razon de vida. Un libro tan interesante que lo lleva a descubrir la aventura de su vida. Experiensia que nosotros, los lectores compulsivos experimentamos en el dia a dia.  Tanto me encanto el libro que lo termine de leer en una sola semana.  Desde su inicio hasta ese fina tan estupendo, luego de que pareciera que no iba a ser asi, fue lo mejor que he leido en toda mi vida.  Y han sido muchos los libros que he leido. Tan bueno es, que me atreveria a apostar que si te gusto el Codigo Da Vinci, este te va a gustar mil veces mas.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Paul McCartney's songwriting is indeed a peculiar beast.  It's hard to find albums in his sizeable catalog that are consistently great, but it does make for a treasure hunt trying to pick out the gems. The highest praise I can give Paul's latest effort is that EVERY track has something indelible about it that lingers in your head and rewards repeat listens. Therefore, I would like to briefly discuss each track.    1.) Fine Line - Paul's fine return to rocking form, opening promisingly with, \\"There is a fine line between recklessness and courage,\\" which is probably not topical, but can certainly be interpreted as such.  Imagine the stomp of \\"Flaming Pie\\" put to far better use.    2.) How Kind Of You - The one track that could be called \\"McCartney meets Radiohead\\" and also the most autobiographical.  The song's melody seems to drift in space around Paul's precious vocal, as a harmonium and loops accentuate the story of a man finding love late in life. Genuinely touching.    3.) Jenny Wren - Most love it, but many have ripped this track for being a supposed xerox of \\"Blackbird\\". Well, that one was nearly forty years ago, Paul openly discusses wanting to craft something similar in feel, and Wren is quite a bit more complicated.  The instrumental duduk passages are haunting, and the social commentary is simple but not too preachy.      4.) At The Mercy - A product of improvisation and simple lyrics and melody, Mercy nonetheless creates quite an atmosphere via the cinematic strings and a foreboding lead vocal. A definite mood-setter.    5.) Friends To Go - Paul has spoken of this song as if it was ghost-written by George Harrison, and the crisply-strummed acoustic, plain-spoken vocal, and contemplative lyrics bear that out.  Would have made a great track for the Traveling Wilburys.    6.) English Tea - A silly but instant favorite, with Paul being unabashedly Brit as he invites you to join him and the quartet for a little refreshment.  The song is short, sweet, and very hard to get out of your head.  I had a friend who sang it all the way to a McCartney concert, until I finally succumbed to its charms.    7.) Too Much Rain - Gorgeous and moving.  Paul makes a sincere attempt to reach out to the burdened and depressed segment of his audience, and the result is one of the album's finest melodic efforts.  The chorus and piano melody are just lovely.      8.) A Certain Softness - Paul becomes Dennis O'Bell on this bossa nova lounge piece.  But good lounge music it is, with playful lyrics and some lovely percussion work.  One that Paul obviously had a blast recording.    9.) Vanity Fair - As with \\"Rinse The Raindrops\\" on Driving Rain, this track raises both your eyebrows as you ask, \\"This is him?!!\\"  The DVD doc shows a glimpse of the early recording of Vanity Fair, where it was uptempo and probably would have ended up more a kin to \\"Too Many People\\".  The relaxed, sublime treatment of the song turns it into something else entirely, with some rather pointed lyrics.  Anyone who has hit a wall in communication with someone will identify with the track, and it's my vote for best of the record.      10.) Follow Me - Simple and anthemic, this is probably the most conventional song, but heartwarming nonetheless, and will probably inspire lots of hand-held sings in the crowd at future Paul concerts.      11.) Promise To You Girl - Some more relaxed piano chords as Paul looks \\"at the backyard of my life\\".  Then a Bohemian Rhapsody-like harmony section.  And then the song comes to rocking life, showing that Paul can still take you by surprise. All in all, a fine abbreviated nod to Paul's fascination with pop suites.      12.) This Never Happened Before - The straight-forward love song on the album, given a little extra character by the subtle beat-box that runs throughout.  Definitely a candlelight song, as we see Paul recording it on the DVD.      13.) Anyway - Is that \\"People Get Ready\\" I hear?  Paul does ape Mr. Mayfield's melody, but puts itto great use as a springboard for a terrific closer.  This is the track that really grew on me, as I had first dismissed its simple words and arrangement.  But it's power arises from its simplicity, wherein Paul pleads with a disconnected love to \\"please, please, please get in touch.\\"  For anyone who's been there, this song is great therapy as you try to wait it out for the one you love.      The album doesn't quite end with the closing strains of Anyway, as we have a few more minutes of Paul noodling, first with a moody piano piece, then some silly stomping rock, then a sound-effect laden fadeout.  Nothing earth-shattering, but its inclusion isn't offensive.      My short-hand description of this album to fellow Paul fans is \\"Flaming Pie without the filler.\\"  Chaos & Creation shows very much the home-made intentions of that album, but benefits immeasurably from producer Nigel Godrich's quality control.  Paul no doubt played Godrich several songs that past producers would have allowed for albums that are among his lesser works.  By having a producer willing to say \\"No,\\" every track has at least a sparkle of true McCartney magic.  And the producer's insistence that Paul play nearly everything means that the sparkle shows in the performance as well as the songwriting.  It is also a moody album as well as a meaty one, a true rarity in the McCartney catalogue.  Not to say that Chaos & Creation is especially dark or depressing, but there are more minor chords used here than on just about any three other Macca albums combined.      Even the recorded tracks that didn't make the album are worthwhile, and you should find them however you can. In fact, their omission from the deluxe package of the CD is my only disappointment. \\"Comfort Of Love\\" is a great energetic piece, and will help placate those who think the album should rock more for some reason. Then there's \\"Growing Up Falling Down\\".  The song is very simple, with a slight oriental feel around  two chords, but it features the absolute spookiest McCartney vocal ever put on tape.    That exhausts most of what I have to say about Chaos & Creation In The Backyard.  Suffice to say, it was honestly better than what I was expecting at this point in Sir Paul's career, since I thought Driving Rain was a fluke, emboldened by his then-recent losses. It's comforting to see that Paul can be just as inspired by his joy, and channel it into an album that REALLY will be counted among his best.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|I adore this movie. The whole weirdness of it all, plus they have Marilyn Manson as a club kid named Christina and he looks like he has the time  of his life in this one. One of my favorite parts is where they have the party in the big truck and Christina is driving it, with a hit of acid on her tongue. The actor who plays Fez on That 70s Show (forgive me...I can't think of his name offhand) also gives an incredible performance, and I'm quite used to him as the character of Fez. Not once did I think \\"Fez\\" while I watched Party Monster. This isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but if you ever did the late-night raves and partying in your life, you'll feel right at home, even if you don't party like that anymore.
B000301YY8|4.0|\\"Back to Bedlam\\" has been playing in my local coffe shop for about two weeks now, and when I found myself humming one of the songs at work the other day, I went back to the shop to ask who the artist was. PRevious reviewers were right - this album is addictive. The songs are simple and catchy, great for singing along to in your car. My personal favorite is track #8 - \\"Prodigal Son.\\" The melody is very upbeat adn happy, and yet teh lyrics, when you listen to them are really depressing - \\"Once he was a lover/sleeping with another/now he's just known as a cheat./Wish he'd had a mirror/seen a little clearer/looked into the eyes of the weak.\\" The contrast is fresh and different.<br /><br />There really aren't any bad songs on this album. Though it is short - thirty five minutes maybe - it is easy to listen to two or three times in a row with out tirign of the music. I can't wait to hear more from James Blunt. Highly recommended.
B000001DTM|5.0|I love this album I love the unique sound on this album. This is my second favorite album of theres. First of course is joshua tree. This is when bono and the boys were at the top of there game.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|The \\"Amarantine\\" flower is a good metaphor for Enya's music, which seems to blossom eternally, and especially now. This new album brings the best from Enya: it is melodical, moving and touching, more than ever. The title song is truly addicting, and my other favorites are the emotional \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" and \\"Sumiregusa\\", the upbeat \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\" and the instrumental \\"Drifting\\".  <br />And one final favorite of mine: if you like Enya's music, you will love Arye Geiman, a very romantic composer, whose music really awakens your imagination. You can listen to it at the \\"CDbaby com\\" website.
B0000042MY|5.0|I love this movie and of course the score that should have won the Oscar! It fits this period piece perfectly. I can't believe the only DVD version of this movie available is the Director's Cut which actually cuts some of the scenes and the best part of the musical score. The \\"I Will Find You\\" song is cut out of the new DVD version. I love that song and how it fit into the movie. I prefer to watch my original VHS copy even though the color is dull, because I don't want any of these wonderful songs cut out.
B0002OERI0|1.0|What the heak happened to Green Day, \\"Nimrod\\" and \\"Warning\\" were dissapointing compared to their albums \\"Dookie\\" and \\"Insomniac\\", but this is just utter trite, and totally lacking of any inspiration or let alone  - music. <br /> <br />
B0000DJZA0|4.0|These guys rule I dont usualy like live albums this one rules. They sound awesome live. I grew up on u2 rem etc this group is becoming one of my favorite groups.
B00004YTXH|5.0|Truly the best of Ennio Morricone's music: very exciting, diverse and colorful, this CD is a great value. If you like Morricone's music, you'll probably love Arye Geiman - a yet unknown, but young and promising composer, whose music is also very melodic.   [...]
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The voices of these women are angelic- I was truly touched by their performances.  This .... artfull, Professional style of singing is bliss for the ear to behold!
B0002VEXUA|3.0|This DVD is commerating 10 years since the release of Oasis's dbut album in August 1994, and it would be fair to say they've released an album (expection to Morning Glory) thats done it justice since. <br />After Be Here Now, Oasis have released a string of pointless records that go absolutley no where, their latest (Don't Beleive The Truth) being the most unartistic statement they've yet to make, yet hailed as a return to form because it won awards and made it to number one, which of course means nothing as their has been nothing else to come out in a blue moon that has shook anything up in recent times. <br /> <br />This band sold out after their \\"Standing on the shoulder of Giants\\" album that was released in 2000. <br /> <br />The DVD is sad to watch because you get the feeling the band a more a nostalgia act (much like whats become of U2 and The Rolling Stones these days) rather than making any impact as a band for there music at the present time. <br />And the DVD concentrating on the album is mostly gossip from journalists and radio announcers and the newer members of the band, and Mani from the Stone Roses raving about how great they think it is, and of course Liam and Noel Gallaghar reflecting on how many times they had to record it, as well as they're producer Owen Morris who spends more time swearing than anything else (and what else can he say? We recorded the album, I was the only one who knew how to mix the record - simple) <br /> <br />Funnily enough, its nice to see Bonehead again and his parts the most interesting. <br /> <br />As for the extras, its just Noel reflecting on stories that last for 20 seconds, the best part is the bonus DVD. <br /> <br />Overall a complete waste of time from a band that should be doing alot better these days.
B00000IPAX|5.0|To me, it's sad that blink 182 is gone. But blink fans can always go back and listen to this cd to remember why we love blink 182; because they tell the truth. <br /> <br />1. Dumpweed: a perfect upbeat song to start this cd.  <br /> <br />2. Don't Leave Me: Mark's vocals really bring this song to life, and the music is just perfect for this song <br /> <br />3. Alien's Exist: what some people may think is your \\"typical\\" blink song, this song is supposed to make you laugh and it does. <br /> <br />4. Going Away To College: Mark is my favorite member of blink (not to take anything away from tom and travis, they are awesome too) and this track is one of the reasons why. His vocals actually express sincerity as well as sadness. <br /> <br />5. What's My Age Again?: very popular, and for good reason. hilarous lyrics and awesome music. <br /> <br />6. Dysentary Gary: well written song about a boy in love with a girl who is in love with someone else, and is possibly my fav song on this cd. <br /> <br />7. Adam's Song: what people consider as blink's first \\"mature\\" song, about suicide and depression. <br /> <br />8. All The Small Things: the song that really got blink 182 popular. good lyrics, good music, hilarous music video <br /> <br />9. The Party Song: one of mark's best. very fast music, very very fast singing, and the lyrics speak an important truth. <br /> <br />10. Mutt: originally written for the movie \\"American Pie\\". its about a couple and how they obsess over sex. <br /> <br />11. Wendy Clear: not the best, not the worst, but something bout this song just really got me into it. <br /> <br />12. Anthem: brilliant lyrics, awesome drumming by travis, and tom does an awesome job of singing. <br /> <br />overall this record is awesome, all punk rock fans must have this cd
B000002KMY|5.0|I had got this CD for my Birthday from one of my closest friends.  When i first poped in the cd, i thought it would sound just like Heaven and Hell.  Well it didnt.  I was blown away by almost every song on this album.   <br /> <br />Turn Up the Light:(4/5)Heard it many times before i owned the album so i got a little bored with it. <br /> <br />Voodoo:(5/5)This song has some of the finest riffs out of any Sabbath song.  Amazing <br /> <br />The Sign of the Southern Cross:(10/5)One of the GREATEST Sabbath songs ever written, plus the best song on the album.  I was absolutly blown away by this song, by its haunting riffs and metal sound. <br /> <br />E5150:(4/5)Dont listen to those reviews saying this is a useless song.  Its not.  The first minute about is just sound effects.  But the rest of the song rules.  Also has haunting riffs which makes the song good.   <br /> <br />The Mob Rules:(5/5)In my opinion the heaviest song(meaning most metalish)Incredible Guitar work done here and Dio's Vocals make it even better. <br /> <br />Country Girl:(4/5)Kind of like Voodoo but still very good. <br /> <br />Slipping Away:(3/5)Least best on the album.  Its alright it keeps repeating it self over nd over making it least best.  It was probably just one of those filler songs.   <br /> <br />Falling off the Edge of the World:(9/5)Just as good as SOTSC only a step lower.  Second best song.   <br /> <br />Over and Over:(5/5)Its just like Lonley is the Word from H&H but heavier which makes it better.  Perfect way to close the Album.   <br /> <br /> <br />Some advise to some people....Dont compare the Ozzy albums to the Post-Ozzy albums.  Its like comparing the DLR Van Halen Albums to the Van Hagar ones.  ITS not possible, its a whole different story after ozzy.  This is in my opinion the best of the After Ozzy stuff.  If you dont have it, GET IT!! NOW!!! You wont be disapointed.  And for some more advise, DONT GET any of the so called \\"Sabbath\\" albums after Born Again. A total wasteof your time.  The only ones to buy are DEHUMANIZER, Reunion, and Past Lives.  Now after Reading this go out and buy this now!! stop reading this review and get it. <br /> <br />P.S. I like to thank my friend for awarding me with this piece of Gold----Thanx
B00097A5I6|1.0|What a horrendous album, this is Oasis's selling out (amazingly) and no I'm not being sarcastic. <br /> <br />This being Oasis's most uninspired and unartistical statement of an an album ever and most commercial. <br />There is absolutley nothing except commercial success in which you could call this album a return to form or even a good album on its own. <br /> <br />The production and the songs are just lazily done and thrown together crap, sounds like a album made to pay the phone bill. <br />
B00005AR3G|5.0|I love this movie.  As an adult, I was expecting to be bored by this Disney movie.  However, I instead found myself rolling on the floor with laughter.  My friends and I (all older than 18) all love it.  My nickname is now \\"llamaface\\" because of this movie.  Extremely quotable and fun!
0974872407|4.0|Este libro no es una cuenta de felices personajes soando de mejores tiempos o futuros brillantes.  Es una relato de niebla, aguaceros, el decrpito y la oscuridad. Es una cuenta de consecuencias cuando los ambicines de padres no se conformen de los inspiracines de sus hijos.  Tambien es una cuenta en que mentiras pueden destrozar vidas y familias enteros, y la negligencia pueden crear puro malo.  Tal vez, en varios pasajes inspiradas, este es el primero libro que me he trasportado atrs, hasta hace veinte aos para actualmente sentir otro vez los emociones de primer amor adolescente (Una hazaa impresionante que tal vez merece su propio tratamiento en una novelita).  Pero, a pesar de todo, es un libro muy largo y a menudo un peso a llevar hasta alcanzar la ltima pgina.  A mi, por eso, este novela merece cuatro estrellas.  Espero el prximo libro del mismo autor.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|I have to say I haven't seen this movie yet. I live in Lansing, MI and I have no idea if or when it will be released here. But I have read the short story a couple of times and it is heartbraking. I can only imagine what the movie will be like. Even thought I haven't seen the movie, when I listen to the soundtrack I am moved. It goes beautifully with the story. It could be the first soundtrack for a book. Even though the songs were taken from the movie, after reading the story and listening the album, it's like they go hand in hand. The songs make me cry as much as the book does. I definitley recommend it.

0553573403|5.0|The Song of Ice and Fire series is the best fantasy series that I have ever read and A Game of Thrones is the book that started it all.<br /><br />One of the major reasons that this book is set apart from many other entries into the fantasy series is that it is completely original, based somewhat on the historical Wars of the Roses, and is not a rehashing of other works. Most new fantasy novels tend to recycle Tolkien's formula by utilizing elves, dwarves, and other mystical beings. However A Game of Thrones is different since all the characters are humans just like you and me. The use of magic is limited as well (sorry Harry Potter fans) which is a great boon to the series. In other books, magic is seen so frequently that it loses its significance but in the A Song of Ice and Fire series when magic is used, it is rare, dark, and usually of great import.<br /><br />I would say that this book is superior to anything Tolkien, Brooks, or Jordan have ever written for various reasons. For one thing, Martin is not afraid to let his characters die. You'll find that one out for yourself. I also enjoy the rich cast of characters and how each chapter is divided by point of view, so you get a different look at some of the same events. The characters are developed so well, especially Tyrion Lannister, Eddard Stark, and Jon Snow, that I found myself really getting involved and caring about what happened to them. I know this may sound trivial, but I also liked how Martin uses the title of Ser for his knights instead of Sir. It contributes to the creation of an original world, which is what I'm sure Martin had in mind.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this book stacks up against Books 2 and 3 of the series because they are all so brilliant, and I haven't read A Feast for Crows yet. A Game of Thrones, however, is just the right length to hook the reader on a great series while also richly advancing the story. The next two books in the series are highly recommended and are so good that you will not want to put them down.<br /><br />This will be remembered as one of the great fantasy book/series of the modern age. If you love fantasy, you will love A Game of Thrones. Enjoy!them down.    This will be remembered as one of the great fantasy book/series of the modern age.

0007117248|5.0|One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted.  The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.<br /><br />This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own.  This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...'  It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me).  The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection.  This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers.  Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.<br /><br />Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room.  Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia.  In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.<br /><br />The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp.  The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all.  The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George.  Other parallels abound.<br /><br />The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.<br /><br />This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time.

B0000683DH|5.0|Oddly enough I have not seen a single original series Star Trek episode. I've heard the classic Kirk vs. Spock music and know the character names but never actually watched an episode. Same thing with the other series although I have watched all the Next Generation films. So on a whim and since everyone says II is the best, I blind bought and it was a good purchase. <br /> <br />Apparently(like I said, didn't watch original series), Captain Kirk banished genetically engineered Khan to a desolate planet for 15 years. A little snafu accident with Chekov and his new ship's captain finds himself face to face with Khan. His plan? Why revenge of course. Using mind control bugs he takes over the ship and surprise attacks the Enterprise leaving it a bit crippled. <br /> <br />Turns out there's another thing Khan wants: the Genesis program, which can actually create life on lifeless planets. It has the reverse effect on life already there: it destroys it so the new life can thrive. Perfect annihilation weapon, no? So Captain Kirk and his crew, including new recruit Saavik(and also film newcomer Kirstie Alley of Cheers fame). <br /> <br />What makes II work is that it's quite action packed. It builds up slowly until Khan takes over the ship then the fight begins. It's the 80's so everything was pre CG with motion control shots and cloud tank effects for the nebula at the end but you wouldn't care anyways. Also a quite significant event happens at the end and it's handled particularly well. <br /> <br />As for acting, everyone is of course top notch in their character. No Oscar caliber but come on, we're just happy Spock acts like Spock right? Known for...his...overracting...and...pause-y speech, William Shatner is quite a surprise on here especially his infamous \\"KHHHAANNN!\\". <br /> <br />I'm kind of torn between this film and First Contact as the best Star Trek(Granted I've only seen 7-10 and this) but so far it's definately up there as the best Trek adventure.
6304696566|5.0|The \\"Searchers\\", director John Ford's best of breed western epic, served as inspiration for Bruce Springsteen's conversion from an Asbury Park troubador, to a more universal and informed citizen of the world \\"Boss\\"..John Landau, a movie buff, and Springsteen's business manager, convinced Springsteen to preview \\"The Searchers\\" to locate his particular artistic narrative..It worked, and Springsteen found in Ethan Edwards, John Wayne's outlaw character in \\"The Searchers\\", the definitive anti-hero he was intent on capturing in his songwritings!..So, if Springsteen admits there is ore to mine in John Ford's tribute to the continental conflicts between the Comanche Indians, the United States Cavalry, and the immigrant settlers, than originally anticipated, perhaps you too should stake a claim in Ford's splendid retelling of a search for a hostage pioneer lass..In this case, a young Natalie Wood, is seized by a raiding Comanche war party headed-up by Chief Scar, for future marriage material..Ethan believes with all his brooding heart, the more humane and responsible act is to recapture the girl, to kill her, to spare the family the ignoble indignity of knowing she has become Indian truss, a buck!..Marty, the adopted brother of the missing girl refuses to let Ethan pursue the manhunt alone, and sleeps with one eye open on the trail, for fear Ethan will slip out of camp and just kill the girl, rather than rescue her..\\"The Searchers\\" becomes in the end the more serious and psychological pursuit of Ethan's humanity, since his hatred of the Comanche's translates to a need to annihilate Natalie Wood's character since she is no longer white, a human being!..For 5 years Marty and Ethan scour the Texas plains to track down the hostage, and have a pantheon of ruthless re-encounters with the Comanche's, driven on again and again by Ethan's steadfast hatred and rage against any and all things Indian..Ironically, the girl is at last located and Ethan is ready to assassinate the girl once and for all, but Marty body-shields the girl from being sniped by Ethan..In the end, Ethan has a defining epiphany and drops the rifle and tells the girl, \\"Debbie, let's go home, it's over!\\"
B00003CXCT|5.0|Although this DvD set has gotten some poor reviews it shouldnt! The bonus disc has loads of cool documentaries, not to mention the fact that the movies have been fixed alot.  I know the old school fans are most likely in a state of digust after the last comment but i truely believe that these dvds are better. Not having seen the original version of in the theatres and being captivated by that experience, the new effects are a relief. With all of the prequeals being released it was hard to sit down and watch the complete star wars series.  The poor effects took away from the plot.....that the old star wars is set 20 years in the future.  The new effects help with the reality of the films, and help connect the saga.  Widescreen shots, and scope plays a large role in showing the viewer the full scope of the Star Wars Universe.  The adding of Hayden Christianson to the RETURN of The JEDI also adds to completing the epic.   <br />So if you arent obsessed with seeing the original old version of STAR WARS these are the movies for you.....
B000002U82|5.0|I have searched far and wide, throughout the music world. Progressive metal, death metal, avant garde jazz, neo classical and many others. Yet, I still have yet to experience an album like Dark Side of the Moon. The musicianship of the Pink Floyd was by no means virtuoso. What they had though, was an uplifting humanistic vision, and it shone through on all nine tracks of this album. <br /> <br />Whenever I listen to Speak-Breathe, I always feel compelled to listen more and more to this album and hear the music again. Now, Gilmour himself said he had a \\"lack of skill\\", which was why his solos were inadvertently well-composed and based on feelings. Gilmour may not have had the speed of Petrucci, the crunching-ness of Thordendal, the highly melodic speed of Rhoads, but boy, could he evoke emotions, and those who have listened to DSotM will testify to that. <br /> <br />It's probably time for a track-by-track analysis, but I really see that as a personal \\"Lateralus\\" - may be brilliant analyses, but highly pompous and self-indulgent, leads to few people's benefit. I can only say one thing. <br /> <br />The Dark Side of the Moon beckons.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Many have called this particular Austen book dark. It is. It is also about what happens when Life's chances have passed us by. Have we spent them well? Do we have any regrets? This movie is a glimpse into what can happen when someone is given a second chance...yet, will our main character Anne decide to take it? Or will she cave in yet again to her families wishes? <br /> <br />One of the delights of this film, as well as the darker aspects, is the unvarnished look into the lives of the families around Anne. We see her own family's problems, and we also see what could have been had she married someone else and made other choices. Anne herself is well respected by many who frankly, are people in this day and age would be well liked!  <br /> <br />The main reason I love this film besides how well the characters are defined is that the atmosphere created is so real. It is like having a glimpse into this particular moment in time: into differing people's lives, their connections with each other, and the light of the candles on the tables.....it's almost as if one were a voyeur standing outside watching everyone enjoy themselves. Dark? Yes. Life can be dark. It can also be beautiful. Both are captured here.
B000AARKOO|2.0|When I first saw the trailers for this latest historical epic I was immediately drawn in by the fact that finally Hollywood was going to tackle the crusades.  With the terrific director, Ridley Scott (\\"Gladiator\\", \\"Hannibal\\", and \\"Alien\\") at the helm for this movie, and great acting talents; such as, Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, and Jeremy Irons, there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that this movie was going to be great.  Many times movies live up to their expectations, especially the historical epics; however, this movie was not among those living up to the hype built up around them. <br /> <br />\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is the story of basically the battle for Jerusalem, which was the focus of a growing holy war between Christians and Muslims, a war that has been dubbed the Crusades.  The war is told through the eyes of Balian (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith who takes over for his father (Liam Neeson) as protector of Christian-controlled Jerusalem.  At this time there is an uneasy alliance between King Baldwin, who controls Jerusalem, and Saladin, leader of the Muslims who want to claim Jerusalem as their own.  But this peace is not meant to last, and both sides are embroiled in all out war over control of the Holy Land.  Now, Balian must protect his people and his city, while still trying to believe in the cause he is fighting for. <br /> <br />It's sad to think that this movie, \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" should have been the cinematic achievement that would accurately depict the Crusades, and instead it turned out to be a very politically correct look at this war that has been fought for centuries, and is still being fought in a way.  The story portrays both sides as being generally non-committal towards their causes, and that the Christians and Muslims got along fairly well for the most part prior to the fighting.  Basically, the creators of this movie didn't want to step on any sensitive issues regarding religion, so instead we get a watered down version of the story. <br /> <br />The acting was good, though not always terrific, the story never really lets the audience come to root for any of the characters, especially the lead character Balian.  Some of the sequences are a bit unbelievable, one that particularly stands out is the shipwreck, which only Balian walks away from, since he's the hero of the movie it makes sense for him to survive to the end of the film, however, I for one could have cared less if he would have died in the shipwreck.  Overall, the fight scenes were impressive when they happened, but they seemed to be too spread out over the 2 1/2 hour duration of the movie, the acting was good, and the directing was good, but in the end the story is the let down.  Hopefully, some other director will come along that has a little more guts and will tell a more engaging, less politically correct, and more accurate account of the Crusades. <br /> <br />\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is rated R for violence.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|When I heard that Peter Jackson was remaking King Kong, I seriously had doubts that the movie would be any good.  Jackson had all sorts of success from Lord of the Rings, but I wasn't sure if he could come up with great movies like that consistently, and especially with a classic story like Kong!  It turns out that Peter Jackson can in fact come up with great movies consistently, and this is because of his ability as not only as a great director, but also as a great storyteller... <br /> <br />Kong is about a Vaudeville actor in New York named Ann Darrow who is found by a movie producer that needs a leading lady in a movie.  Everyone is loaded up onto a boat, and a voyage is made to an mythical island known only as Skull Island.  Once there, the boats crew and it's passengers land on the island, and quickly realize that the ruins of and ancient civilization are still occupied by savage natives.  The inhabitants of this island capture Ann Darrow and make here a sacrifice to Kong.  The ships crew returns to the island in a rescue mission and witnesses a giant creature taking Ann into the jungle.  While searching for her, they encounter dinosaurs, giant insects, vampire bats, and all other sorts of creatures that should have been extinct like the giant ape that took the girl.  Kong turns out to be a giant silverback gorilla and is captured and is taken back to New York City where he wrecks havoc, which ends tragically.   <br /> <br />Sounds like the same old Kong story, but what sets it apart was how well the story was put together and the little details that were added to make the movie so much more realistic and emotional.  For example, I'll point this out with the Kong/Ann Darrow interactions.  Instead of Kong just creepily taking Ann Darrow and instantly \\"falling in love\\" with her and her having reciprical feelings instantly, this is slowly built up.  At first Kong seems to be nothing more than an alpha-male silverback gorilla who wants respect from his captive.  From the bones in his first lair, it didn't look like he took rejection very well.  Eventually, Ann gets the ape to get out of his Alpha-male mode by going into here vaudeville act which sparks his interest.  He liked dancing, he turned his nose up at the computer generated juggling, and really liked it when Ann fell over.  This made it so Kong was willing to risk everything for Ann, saving her several times from dinosaurs and other baddies.  Still more amazing detail in the dinosaur fight scenes too.  Kong kills a T-rex and after it's dead turns into a little curious monkey and starts playing with the lizards mouth (although I believe this particular detail was in the original as well).  Kong and Ann end up on the top of the gorilla shaped mountain in a cave occupied by vampire bats and the bones of rest of the Kong family. Here, Ann tells Kong that his island is beautiful by pointing and putting her hand to her heart.  Later in the movie, back in New York, while pearched on top of the Empire State building, Kong points to the rising sun over the New York skyline and starts pointing and putting his hand over his heart.  This is minutes before Kong's tragic ending, but this one detail, the fact that Kong was not just a big stupid monkey, but an intelligent ape that understood was what pushed to movie to a new height for me.  I can't remember the last time I cried in a movie, but as soon as Kong did this, it brought a tear to my eye thinking about what was about to happen.  Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and the other directors/writers that worked on this movie are genius.The special effects were superb.  In the first few wide shots of New York I was sort of skeptical of the CGI created city because it looked rather fake to me, but I only had that thought once in the beginning of the movie.  After that, the amount of realism was great.  Andy Sirkis did an amazing job as Kong, as well as playing another role in the movie as Lumpy the cook.  It wasn't quite as unique as Smegil from Lord of the Rings, but for being a completely computer generated gorilla, Kong was amazingly realistic in his appearance as well as behavior.  The Empire State Building scenes were great too.  Someone that I was with got vertigo from these scenes.   <br /> <br />Besides the long legnth of the movie which takes up quite a bit of time to watch, King Kong was flawless.  It is the only movie all year long that I can honestly give 5 stars.  In my opinion, it's academy award material... <br />
B00003CXAT|5.0|Perhaps one of the best films ever to grace a big screen, \\"Jurassic Park\\" is a suspenseful thrill ride that I never tire of watching.  It's hard to believe that this film came out over a decade ago and yet the advances it made in special effects are still influencing films today.  I won't waste much time on describing the plot because just about everyone already knows what happens.  For those not so inclined, here's a brief run-through:  Scientist screws with dino-DNA, clones a few of the beasts for an amusement park/zoo, needs legal and scientific approval, Newman steals information and shuts the entire park down, people begin to die, the surviviors attempt to escape.<br /><br />Now that you have an idea of what is going on, just know that this is one of the most suspenseful films made in the last twenty years.  It features a wonderful cast headed up by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum.  Richard Attenborough turns in a wonderful performance as the park's visionary creator and Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello play his very eager grandchildren.  In fact, Mazzello almost steals the show with his constant bickering over the facts in Dr. Grant's (Neill) book on dinosaurs being related to birds.<br /><br />Since its creation, I have yet to see a film influence movie-making as much as this one did.  The special effects are almost flawless.  The action is thrilling and suspenseful and the sound is amazing.  Even the cinematography provides some stunning visuals for the viewer.  Speilberg outdid himself with this one.<br /><br />If you purchase only one film from the nineties, this is the one to buy.  It was followed by two sequels, the horrible \\"The Lost World\\" and the popcorn friendly \\"Jurassic Park III,\\" but both pale in comparison to this original classic.<br /><br />Highly recommended to ALL fans of cinema.  I don't care if you're a lover of Westerns, Comedies, Sci-Fi, etc.  This one film is one of the best of all time.

B00003CXXS|4.0|\\"Jurassic Park III\\" saves the \\"Jurassic Park\\" series from sinking into the bloated \\"Great movie followed by wretched sequel\\" genre.  \\"The Lost World\\" was such a bad film that I waited for this particular sequel to hit the DVD shelves and satellite TV before watching it.  It strays a little from the original film's formula by dropping the bulk of the suspense and horror as well as running time and dives right into the action sequences with those ever-wonderful lookin' dinosaurs.<br /><br />In this particular film we are reacquainted with Sam Neill's stellar character, Dr. Grant.  He's conned into going on a \\"fly over\\" of island B that we saw in \\"The Lost World\\" with William H. Macy and Tea Leoni.  Their true intentions are to find Leoni's boyfriend (she has had a falling out with Macy, her ex-husband) and her and Macy's son.  Both were lost on a parasailing trip a few weeks earlier.<br /><br />Once Dr. Grant realizes what is going on, he at first refuses to help them but eventually gives in.  His assistant happens to pick up a raptor egg in hopes of cashing in later.  Big mistake.  What results is everybody's favorite intelligent predators making short work of the search party as they run wildly in an attempt to escape.<br /><br />We are introduced to pteranodons and a spinosaur.  We also get to catch up with the ol' T-Rex as well.  All of the dinosaurs look wonderful in this film.  The action is very fast-paced and very loud.  Macy and Neill are probably the two best parts of this film as both seem to be enjoying their time on the screen.  Laura Dern pops in for a few seconds in order to reprise her role from the original film and call in a favor for Dr. Grant.<br /><br />The scenery is captivating at times and is just as beautiful as it was in the first two \\"JP\\" flicks.  There seems to be a lot more humor in this film and, as stated before, emphasis is put on action and explosions instead of suspense.<br /><br />I recommend this film as a definite purchase if you enjoyed the original \\"JP\\" film.  It has a wonderful cast, including the supporting characters, and it is still fun to see the T-Rex and the raptors do their worst onscreen.se if you enjoyed the original \\"JP\\" film.

B00004R9A4|5.0|For a Disney film 'Bedknobs And Broomsticks' differs in many ways from the typical Disney fair.<br /><br />1:)The setting of this movie is (as another reviewer said) is somewhat dark.The film is set around a mail order 'apprentice witch' who believes she can single handedly end WW2 and outfox Nazi Germany.The sets include:dirty London streets,shady book sellers and includes imagry of locals painting sign posts.<br /><br />2:)This movie doesn't have a particularly happy ending,a Disney trademark.Ms.Price's (Angela Lansbury) home is destroyed and she loses her powers.Even as the little refugee boy Paul still<br /><br />has her enchanted bedknob.<br /><br />3:)This is one of many Pre-Roger Rabbit attempts at blending live action and animation and (for it's day) did an excellent job at blending the two.<br /><br />4:)This movie was clearly scripted for older children or adults.<br /><br />More of a family picture then a childrens one.Some of the themes will probably appeal to adults.<br /><br />5:)This movie is often referred to as a 70's version of 'Mary Poppins'.That's true to some extent but it doesn't have that films rosey sentiments and happy ending.<br /><br />  I think 'Bedknobs And Broomsticks' will probably appeal to non Disney fans (especially young ones) because it isn't 100% typical of the company's output.

0780628551|3.0|In The Astronaut's Wife, photography elements are used to increase the intensity of the film because unsettling camera angles are used and because aggressive and vibrant colors are present.  In addition, a close-up on a radio meant trouble. <br /> I rented this movie because I had never seen it before and have watched it once. <br /> In this movie, the wife of an astronaut deals with suspicions of her husband after he is involved in an unusual event while in space. <br /> Several camera angles that are known for their ability to unsettle the audience were used throughout this movie.  During one scene where Spencer is acting aggressively towards his wife they used a shot of him looking directly up from beneath him.  It was pretty much the opposite of a bird's eye view.  It took a while for me to get used to seeing the image being filmed from that angle and focused on Spencer.  The use of this angle made him seem even more creepy and overpowering.  There is also an extreme low angle of Spencer's wife, Jillian, while she was digging in the refrigerator.  The odd camera angle was almost a piece of foreshadowing because you sensed that something was going to happen.  The next thing we know is that her husband shows up.  There was an oblique angle of the hand rail of the stairs leading to the subway.  At that time Jillian was hiding from Spencer below the rail and his hand was reaching towards it.  The use of this angle increased the amount of suspense in this particular situation.  Near the end of the film, Jillian is attempting to electrocute herself in a suicide attempt.  Spencer shows up and tries to manipulate her.  We get a bird's eye view of the scene as he gets electrocuted and killed.   <br />  The use of the colors red and orange were tools of foreshadowing.  Jillian was cutting carrots when she cuts her finger.  She starts to clean it up when she sees the story of a problem that happened in space that involved her husband.  Sherman Reese was the only person that was willing to look into the possibility that something may have affected the astronauts while they were in space.  His red hat gave us the clue that something bad was going to happen to him.  It is later implied that Spencer kills him. One night, Jillian wakes from a dream in which Spencer is harming her sister.  She wakes shaken but convinced that it was just a dream and there was no chance that there was even the slightest possibility that it could be reality.  Jillian notices that Spencer's hands are red when he gets home that night.  She realizes that he has indeed done something to harm her sister.  She got the \\"vision\\" from the unborn twins that she was carrying.   <br /> Early in the movie it gets stated that radios are the ways for the extra terrestrials to communicate with each other.   At a party there was a shot of a radio and the next thing we know a scream is heard and somebody has just committed suicide.  There are several close-ups on a radio in Spencer and Jillian's house.  This is foreshadowing that a situation similar to that is going to happen soon. <br /> Beware the odd camera angles. <br />

B00005NKKZ|4.0|This album was released before I was born, but my mom was a big fan of their music (still is).  I grew up listening to her play \\"Bridge\\" and \\"Boxer\\" on the piano.  I was nearly a teenager before I realized they were on the radio too!  Others may have recorded \\"Bridge\\" but I will only ever love the original recording.  Listening to this album brings back memories of watching and listening to my mom play the piano, and being at a young age when I  still thought she could do everything and the songs she chose were the same.  I'm glad to have this CD in my collection!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movie is part action, part intellectual drama, part mystery.  The cinematography is highly inventive and dramatic and the plot has to be the greates revenge story since Dumas' \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\"  There is a moment in this film where it all comes together and it feels like you've just been slapped across the face.  Highly recommended!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Excellent movie, cinematography, special effects.  Wonderful how Peter Jackson kept to the original down to the smallest detail.  New scenes make Kong more 'human'.   <br />  May be a little intense for younger children (under 10)
0765309408|5.0|I picked up this book by chance, not having heard of or read John Scalzi previously and once I started couldn't put it down.  In the future, the armed forces (Colonial Defense Force) fights all manner of hostile alien to preserve the right of the human race to colonize new planets.  War is tough, brutal and constant, like in The Forever War, but much tougher.  You can join the CDF at 75, but its a one way trip forever.  It's generally understood that somehow CDF's advanced technology can be used to remake a 75 year old into a warrior, but not how.  So, it's extremely shocking for our hero John Perry to find out that the CDF transfers his consciousness into a newly engineered super-human body made from his own and other alien DNA.  Mr. Scalzi's handling of the concept is original and brilliant.  His characterizations are funny and sweet, and I thought that his description of the relationships between the new recuits was warm and light hearted.  Overall, a very interesting read.  I look forward to the sequel.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Clutch is without a doubt the best rock band in exsistence today.  No other band out there compares.  In recent years I have lost almost all faith in rock music save for a few great bands that are still in exsistence and Clutch is greatest.  Clutch is what rock music should be Big Guitars, catchy and intellegent lyrics, and an overall fun and funky sound.  They just seem to get better with age too.  The fact that Clutch is not the biggest rock band in America puzzels me.  It is good to know there are still bands in it for the right reasons, mainly rocking out.
6305508550|5.0|Milton <br />In Office Space, Milton is seldom ever taken seriously. He is constantly being taken advantage of. First of all, Lumberg never returned the stapler that he had asked for several times. Not to mention, he asked to keep his desk where it was so he didn't have to move it again, but instead, he was pushed into the dark basement. So, in return, Milton took advantage of Initech, the company where he worked. <br />My brother, George, bought Office Space, a few years ago. He really gets a kick out of it because he, too, wishes that he could get paid for doing nothing. There are several parts in that movie that he finds humorous. One day, he and I even mimicked the movie by smashing a computer monitor with a baseball bat. And for him, that was pure fun. But while George liked Office Space from the start, I had to watch it two or three times before I really started to admire the film. Now, every time I watch it, I find something new to laugh about.  <br />Near the beginning of the film, Lumberg took Milton's red stapler- Milton's favorite stapler because it didn't back up. And Milton automatically started to panic as his eyes widened and he started mumbling about how the last time someone took his stapler, they didn't return it. But even with the shock on Milton's face, Lumberg ignored him; he would simply override Milton's voice and say his famous, \\"yeahhh.\\" When  <br />Milton realized that Lumberg wasn't going to return the stapler, he even confronted the receptionist. She also ignored him. <br />Taking Milton's stapler wasn't enough for Lumberg though. When Lumberg told Milton that he'd have to get ready to move his desk, Milton pleaded not to because he had already moved his desk several times. In fact, he once had his desk near a window, but was eventually moved to a smaller cubicle surrounded florescent lights. But Lumberg didn't even consider listening to Milton. Instead, he told Milton that he needed to move his desk into the basement as soon as possiblebecause there wasn't enough room for him upstairs. Milton tried, again, to explain that he had already moved his desk so many times, and he didn't want to do it again. And once again, he was ignored, while Lumberg said, \\"yeah, if you could move it that'd be great.\\" When Milton found himself sitting in the dark basement, that's when he decided that \\"that was the last straw.\\" Milton was getting so angry lately that he even threatened under his breath that he'd burn the building down. <br />So in return, Milton decided to give Initech a little taste of what he was really capable of. He was going to tell Lumberg that he was taking his stapler back. When he charged into Lumberg's office to retrieve his stolen property, the audience were led to believe that he discovered the money stolen by Peter, Michael and Samir, because he walked into the office in the scene right after the scene where Peter puts an envelope with the money under Lumberg's door. Then, I can only assume that he burns the building down as promised earlier in the movie because the building is burnt right after the scene  <br />where Milton stumbles upon the envelope. Milton then vacationed on a hot, sunny beach without a care in the world. And he was living Peters dream - Milton was doing nothing. <br />So throughout the whole movie, we were led to believe Milton was just an unattractive man who could be stepped on by anyone. We watched other people judge him, and we began to judge him too. But we were proved to be wrong about him; he's not as stupid as he seemed. He was bright enough to take the money without any remorse and simply go on vacation. And now, he had the power to boss other people around; now he could get what he wanted. He, the one who had been taken advantage of, was now taking advantage of others. He was the one who prevailed. <br /> <br />
B000000993|5.0|This album changed my life in so many ways I could not possibly explain.Anyone who discounts this album as anything short of genius is simply not worth your time.Everything about this album is original and masterful.Dig a little deeper my friends, don't fear what you don't understand, embrace it. I have been a fan of Tool since '92. For all of you that only like Tool for what they have released post Anemia are just eating up what media hype has fed you. Opiate is an amazing album as well in it's own way. Every record Tool releases is great in it's own right.Trust me nothing they do is by chance. They are all excellent musicians with they're own styles and together they are really something special. Danny Carey is probably the best drummer in rock ever, he never just plays a basic beat. there are so many layers and beats within beats, and he only gets better with every record. Adam Jones is so original in his playing style. As a guitarist myself I can truly appreciate the subtle complexities in his movements. There really is no other guitarist I can think of that has mastered odd time in quite this way. Though he doesn't just shread out fast leads like some players that are very good his playing is an entirely different entity. There are leads but they aren't just an excuse to show his chops they actually add to the landscape of the piece. His style is something you can't quite put your finger on.And both bassist they have had are amazing and powerful, most people see the bass as an additive to the guitar but Tool definitly uses the low end to they're advantage. That low end makes they're sound very dark and haunting.indeed it is a very important piece to the puzzle. Disagree? just listen to schism for example, would that song be the same without that incredible bassline. Last but not least Maynard..........oh,maynard.a true visionary. A lyrical genius , a madman, Just his vocal style alone is enough to make him great, but hear his words and they will truly complicate you. He never seems to stop. With him nothing is at face value. He is a great writer, like Adam he posseses a subtle complexity that must be examined to be appreciated. No other band has gone where Tool goes, No other band could go where Tool goes. Music is just music but this band has made it something more something that I can't even understand. There is something very strange that happens between these people. something that reaches inside something that knows us better than we know ourselves.All I can say is that there are alot of great bands out there but they are not Tool.Thank You
B000000ORX|5.0|Night Ride Home is a nice collection of solid back to basic Joni Mitchell guitar songs. The devastatingly beautiful closing track Two Grey Rooms puts this album over the top.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again since I purchased the DVD some three years ago, and it still hasn't lost any of it's magic!  The music/score, the actors, the action!  Simply the best of the best!  Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops for this one ladies and gentlemen!  Get your copy - good at any price if you want to see a \\"golden\\" golden-age-of-hollywood movie!  Five stars!!
B000BJS4BM|2.0|The CD is great.  The Limited Edition leaves a lot to be desired -- could have included a DVD, full lyrics, etc. instead of the pointless diary.  I bought it for the bonus track (which is terrific), but I was not happy with this clunky package.  For someone who is so cutting edge in her music, this is another packaging disappointment like the \\"American Life\\" Limited Edition.
B0000025D0|5.0|The Rocker. <br /> <br />This is how I think of this album.  It's Bruce's one time that he said, heck with it, I'm gonna blow the house down.  Me.  My voice, my guitar.  Three years of anger.  Three years of frustration, three years of waiting, three years of being jacked around.  It all gets put away on this blazing, searing album.  Payback time, and does he deliver. <br /> <br />Bruce CAN play that axe, folks.  He purposely keeps it in the background on virtually all his other records, but not THIS one!  Solo after blistering solo, mixed high, just searing the speakers with intensity.  He's mad, he's disgusted, and we get to hear the results. <br /> <br />No one expresses themselves any better with music than Bruce Springsteen.  Proof is on this set of songs.  Nearly every one of the tunes has a statement or a line about anger, darkness, despair, or some other dark emotion.  In \\"Factory\\" it's a statement that somebody's gonna get hurt tonight.  On \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" there is a reference to inheriting the sins and pain.  In \\"Candy's Room\\" the singer is upset that strangers from the city bring his prostitute girlfriend gifts, deluding himself that he's the one she really wants.  \\"Racing in the Street\\" talks about how his wife has been so withdrawn from him she can barely speak.  But it's all right, because they're going to wash their sins from their hands in the ocean before going back out and racing, and folks better stay out of his way. <br /> <br />Every one of the above songs has the music set perfectly to the mood.  Breathless full speed ahead with an agonizing solo on \\"Candy's Room\\".  A dirge-like keyboard-driven slow pace to \\"Racing in the Street\\".  Matter-of-fact tone and mid-tempo piano work frames \\"Factory\\". <br /> <br />But the gem, maybe the best song Springsteen has ever done, is \\"Racing in the Street\\".  It's an epic about wasted time, and two lovers meeting in circumstances that are no longer enough to keep them together, about drifting apart. <br /><br />I love \\"Born to Run\\".  I love \\"The River\\".  I adore \\"Born in the USA\\".  I like this guitar drenched, dark vision of the world the best.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|I have never felt strongly enough about a movie to force me to type a review but everyone else seems to be afraid to say what needs to be said about this one.  First off lets forget about this Peter Jackson made LOTR so now I have to bow to him as my new god crap that everyone is doing. <br /> <br />  First off in all seriousness this movie is too long.  By the end of the movie all I could think about was getting up and leaving.  I'm not saying it's bad because it's long though.  I'm saying it's bad because nothing happens that is important very offten.  Some movies need to be very long but this one does not.  Your sitting there an hour before you even get to see King Kong. <br /> <br />  The next big flaw in the movie are the characters.  We spend an hour before they get to the island and yet we still don't care about them.  Even Kong had this problem.  In the past at least you felt bad for the thing but now he is nothing more than a spoiled brat.  Then theres the people we don't know whose sole purpose is to die because we can't kill anyone if theres a chance someone might remember there name when the movie is over.  Even Ann who should have died just from being held in Kong's hand as he runs.  The human body can only be shaken so much.  But she comes out of it without the slightest of bruse good for her. <br /> <br />  In the whole three hours there was only few good parts.  When Kong fought the V-rex I was ammused for a few seconds.  Just all in all the movie was trying to hard to live up to the hype.  Just because Peter Jackson made it doesn't make it an epic to define the ages.  I think I'll go watch Godzilla trash New York.  At least that was entertaining.

B000BKVQTS|4.0|there were two brothers called wilhelm and jacob. wilhelm, the elder, was a dashing schemer, while jacob, the younger, was a thoughtful student of folklore and magic (you can tell he was an intellectual, because he wore glasses). the two travelled from town to town, conning superstitious and backwards people out of their money. one day, they were captured by a ruthless french general who, after having his captain, caravaldi, torture them for a bit, sent them to a little village called marbaden where strange and supernatural things were afoot...<br /><br />this is the premise for terry gilliam's latest film. though the movie boasts an obviously higher budget and features a very different cast than his earlier works, the director's fantastic and creepy sensibilities remain intact. the film is every bit as gruesome, romantic, and bizarre as one of the brothers grimm's fairy tales, and many elements of these stories are scattered throughout the film, suggesting that the brothers were inspired to write their morbid tales by real events during their lives. the cinematography and art direction are unique and cohesive, clearly realizing the vision of the director. comparisons to tim burton's \\"sleepy hollow\\" are certainly warranted, as the film has a similar macabre, \\"painterly\\" feel.<br /><br />however, the cast leaves something to be desired. ledger and damon, while competent in their roles, fall far short of brilliance ( i admit, i put off seeing this film for a long time when i learned that matt damon had a starring part. surprisingly, he turns in a pretty good performance, clearly due to gilliam's strong direction). even jonathan pryce's portrayal of the general seems to be a reprisal of his earlier role as the right hon. horatio jackson, a villain from \\"baron munchausen,\\" a film terry gilliam co-wrote. like jackson, the general speaks with a ridiculous, over-the-top accent, calling the brothers the \\"grams,\\" and is obsessed with order and the triumph of reality over fantasy.<br /><br />the film also features some very convenient plot devices- one might go so far as to say they are deus ex machina. for instance, the character of caravaldi, depicted at first as a twisted torturer and also a pathetic coward, transforms almost magically near the end of the film into a helpful ally for the brothers grimm. the revival of wilhelm grimm after he has been stabbed twice in the heart is also a bit of a stretch, although in this case the necessity for the fairy tale to have a happy ending is understood and a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required.<br /><br />despite these shortcomings, this is an exciting, macabre, and very beautiful movie that can be enjoyed by adults and older children (young kids would probably be a little scared by the film's dark imagery). the film also has a morbid sense of humour taken straight out of the brothers grimm, as when a white kitten is accidentally shredded and sprayed around the room by a horrible torture device. any avid reader of folklore who is familiar with the true work of the brothers grimm, rather than the sugar-coated modern versions of their tales, will be entertained by this interpretation, as will anyone who likes a good story and a bit of a scare.<br /><br />...and they all lived happily ever after...r />the film also features some very convenient plot devices- one might go so far as to say they are deus ex machina. for instance, the character of caravaldi, depicted at first as a twisted torturer and also a pathetic coward, transforms almost magically near the end of the film into a helpful ally for the brothers grimm. the revival of wilhelm grimm after he has been stabbed twice in the heart is also a bit of a stretch, although in this case the necessity for the fairy tale to have a happy ending is understood and a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required. <br />despite these shortcomings, this is an exciting, macabre, and very beautiful movie that can be enjoyed by adults and older children (young kids would probably be a little scared by the film's dark imagery). the film also has a morbid sense of humour taken straight out of the brothers grimm, as when a white kitten is accidentally shredded and sprayed around the room by a horrible torture device. any avid reader of folklore who is familiar with the true work of the brothers grimm, rather than the sugar-coated modern versions of their tales, will be entertained by this interpretation, as will anyone who likes a good story and a bit of a scare. <br />...and they all lived happily ever after...

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had anticipated this movie for over a year.  Having seen Firefly from the start, I was wanting more, and Serenity delivered.  Some people will complain about the 'fanboy' base, or the fact that a movie was made based on a 'failed' television show.  They miss the point.  This is a movie for the viewers, for the fans.  Yes, Joss was effective in making a film that could be understood and enjoyed by a first-timer.  But this film was made for the fans, and that makes it mighty.  Joss fought to make this happen.  We, the 'rabid fanfolk' did what we could to make sure his efforts weren't wasted.  Everybody was rewarded, with something original, with heart, and good story.  Yes, there were differences from the television show, there had to be to make sure that the studio was kept happy, they provided the cash after all.   <br /> <br />The film itself is just good storytelling.  It's not a mindless blockbuster, or a knockoff of an old property.  It isn't a story about super-heroes with adamantium claws, or the hamfisted epic concerning the rather rapid downfall of a mystical night that kills younglings.  Joss took the best aspects of drama, including comedy.  This is a movie that left me breathless and silent to take in everything I'd seen.  What I came away with was a wanting to see more, and an understanding of characters I loved.   <br /> <br />This was good storytelling.  If nothing else is taken from this review, take that.  Joss can tell a story, that speaks to the visceral core of human nature, and he does so with the subtlety that comes from years of evolving the craft.  Do yourself a favor, give Serenity a chance.
B000065BPB|4.0|These headphones are a good all-around set that give you very true audio recreation.  It is slightly lacking in some areas, but the overall feel is very accurate.  They also have a surprisingly good isolation/comfort ratio.  The cord would fit my uses better if it was straight rather than coiled, but it does not make that much of a difference.  For the price, these phones are well worth it.
0743201140|5.0|I love this book, and always buy it as a gift for the people I care about most. For me, it was life-changing. Until I read this book, it never occurred to me to apply my personal life strengths to the workplace. I have now done so - with amazing results. It also has helped my manager manage me more effecitively. He knows what to do and what not to do to inspire me. Plus, I always thought my strengths were my writing and my art - but really, they are just outlets/channels for my strengths. I have many more career options than I ever imagined before. <br /> <br />Marcus was a consultant at a company I onced worked for. He is amazing and fascinating.

B000AP04OM|5.0|As far as I am concerned there are two reasons to pick up \\"The Sound of Music (40th Anniversary Edition)\\" DVD is you already have the movie on DVD.  First, the movie has been digitally restored and if you look at the examples of the restoration on Disc 2 where they the right half of the frame has been cleaned up you can see that they really got the red out (seriously; the old version does not look so much washed out as it does rather reddish to me).  Consequently, the movie looks a lot better.  The change is not as thrilling as when I got to first see it in the letterbox format at home on the laser disc version and realized that on pan and scan we were missing literally half the picture (my kids still remember the shot where they could finally see the massive fountain on the left half of the scren), but if you really love this movie then you want a copy of the new print because the difference is so noticeable.<br /><br />Second, if the first reason is not strong enough, they have loaded up on extras for this DVD.  You have a commentary track by the late director Robert Wise and another with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp (the 10th and last of the Von Trapp kinder).  If you think listening to songs on the DVD is better than listening on the CD (I often find that to be the case), then you can play only the songs or play the songs with sing-a-long subtitles in three languages.  I especially liked the retrospective documentary \\"A Few of My Favorite Things\\" because it talks about the way the Broadway musical was turned into a Hollywood film by shifting songs and setting them up differently (see below).  The reminiscence by Andrews and Plummer is worthwhile as well and the \\"Biography\\" episode \\"The Von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord\\" will certainly open your eyes to the \\"true\\" story behind it all.<br /><br />Watching the film again and learning about how the film was created from all of the DVD extras got me thinking about why this is the most popular movie musical of all time.  The first thing that works is that Robert Wise frontloads this movie big time.  We begin with the wonderful descent of the camera from the clouds until it finds Maria on top of the mountain, where she bursts into the title song and makes it clear that the beautiful vistas of Austria are integral to this film (it did for Salzburg, Austria what \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" did for New Zealand).  After the overture during the title credits we have the \\"Preludium (Dixit Dominus),\\" during which Wise presents us with some stunningly beautiful shots of nuns at prayer, establishing weight to the religious elements of the film.  Then when we get to \\"Maria\\" the Mother Superior and the rest of the nuns strike absolutely the right tone for singing a cute song while dressed in habits.  There is not a moment in this film where Peggy Wood's Mother Superior does not seem like an absolutely real person.  By the time Maria runs past them and does the big double take at having been caught, the film's first big joke, Wise has already established an extremely serious tone for a movie musical.<br /><br />What impresses me about this film is that if you take out the songs I think it still works as a drama and the only reason Julie Andrews did not win an Oscar for the best thing she ever did on film was that she had won the year before for playing the title role in the Dick Van Dyke film \\"Mary Poppins\\" (you have to be Katharine Hepburn not to overcome this sort of liability).  The only musical number that is in danger of going too far is the new \\"I Have Confidence,\\" but that is because Andrews plays it as bluster on Maria's part (e.g., the stumble on the last run).  Once we get past the opening of the movie where Wise so beautifully sets the stage for the film, the person who deserves a lot of the credit is screenwriter Ernest Lehman.  Pay attention to how he sets up the songs so that the seque from dialogue to singing is more naturalistic (\\"My Favorite Things\\" is a prime example of this in the film).  Lehman's script also turned the Captain into a more of a fully developed human being than the martinet of the Broadway version.  Special mention also must be made of the poignant reprises of \\"My Favorite Things\\" when Maria returns, \\"Maria\\" during her walk down the ailse as the bride to be, and the high-brow \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" at the folk festival.<br /><br />Of course, if you have seen the show performed on stage you know that some of the songs have been put in different contexts.  For example, \\"My Favorite Things\\" was originally sung by Maria and the Mother Superior on stage and now becomes the song Maria sings with the kids to establish a report with them instead of \\"Do Re Mi.\\"  That, of course, becomes the show piece of the film as Maria and the children tour Salzburg and the countryside singing, which gets us back to the wonderful scenery that Wise highlights from the opening moment of the film.  There are few Broadway musicals that have been transformed rather than ending up being merely translated when they are brought to the screen.  Some take advantage of more locations (e.g., \\"Camelot,\\" \\"Evita\\"), but all things considered no musical has been upgraded on the big screen as much as \\"The Sound of Music,\\" which is why it remains on the top of the mountain forty years down the road.alistic (\\"My Favorite Things\\" is a prime example of this in the film).

B00005JNZJ|4.0|Even though I knew what the critics were saying about \\"Aeon Flux\\", I decided to go see it anyway. Although I hadn't seen the animated version, nor was familiar with the storyline, after watching the movie, I must say that I didn't find it as bad as I thought I would.  <br /> <br />In the year 2011, a deadly virus killed most of the population. Trevor Goodchild, a scientist, developed a cure for the disease, and the rest of the survivors lived in Bregna, the last city on Earth. We now go to 400 years later, where there are some unusual incidents taking place in Bregna. Rebels known as the Monicans are challenging the Goodchild regime and trying to bring it down, as they feel that Goodchild has something to do with the incidents. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is one of them. Her main aim is to get rid of Trevor Goodchild, but things get really complicated during her mission, as she starts to remember things that she doesn't remember happening. She wants to get to the bottom of what is really going on, and that is what the rest of the movie is all about. <br /> <br />It's too bad the critics are trashing this movie. Personally, I found it a little slow and difficult to understand at first, but after the first 10 minutes, things start becoming very interesting. The special effects are amazing and very life-like, such as Sithandra's `modifications', the city of Bregna, Goodchild's library, etc. Ok, so Charlize is not playing her usual `Oscar winning' role here, but I think she acted very well as Aeon. Just because someone wins an Academy Award doesn't mean that they have to stick to only those types of roles; if that was the case, then there would be no versatility. Similarly, even Sophie Okonedo (after seeing her wonderful performance in Hotel Rwanda) acted fine as Sithandra. The rest of the cast did well for their roles, but nothing great.  <br /> <br />True, the storyline is unique, and this might not be a movie for everyone, but you should at least give it a chance. Don't listen to what the critics are saying. Go see the movie and judge it yourself.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|When Meriam Cooper first used stop motion effects way back in 1933 to engineer the tale of a fearsome giant ape named Kong, the world was amazed. In 1976, the animatronic attempt at a remake fell flat, largely because the filmmakers added little of their own vision and substance to the tale. The thought that ran through my mind the first time we witness Kong in Peter Jackson's superb remake was simply, \\"I wish Cooper were still alive to see this today.\\"  <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has again accomplished the impossible, by taking a familar piece of pop culture widely known and recrafting it in his own stunning vision. \\"King Kong\\" is the distillation of Jackson's boyhood ideals and adult mastery of craft, all combined with the most advanced digital technology possible, to create a masterpiece. He has taken the best elements of the previous films and added even more (perhaps a little too much more), and the result is a sight to behold. However, because Jackson is not merely content with spectacle for its own sake, the experience is much more satisfying and certainly more emotional. Perhaps truly for the first time ever, Kong lives, and he is King.  <br /> <br />Our ill-fated tale begins with Ann Darrow (a radiant Naomi Watts), an attractive and ambitious vaudeville comedian struggling to make ends meet in Depression Era New York. She harbors a desire to become an actress, which she is forced to persue when her act is shut down. But playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), whose work she admires, wants no part of her. Without ever meeting him, she is convinced to seek an alternate career instead (one involving copious amounts of nudity - sadly, this isn't \\"Mulholland Drive\\").  <br /> <br />Enter one Carl Denham (Jack Black), a slicker-than-grease director who can't quite get his monster film to work, and when the studio pulls the plug, he grabs his PA, the camera, and the film canisters and runs. He has a map to a mysterious place called Skull Island (should be an ominous sign, no?), and he figures if he can find an actress and a ship that'll get him there, he'll get the best possible location and make tons of dough. The famous and gifted Jack Driscoll is writing the story, after all. Well, soon he runs into Ann, and hoodwinks the captain AND the playwright (and of course Ann and the clueless lead actor and ship crew) into going along, just before the sirens come calling.  <br /> <br />And so our intrepid voyagers set sail. This occurs in the first hour of the film, and we are introduced to more of the crew and get familiar with our characters and how they operate before the violence begins. A warrant has been issued over the radio for Denham's arrest, and the captain is furious and plans to turn back. However, it is too late - they are enshrouded by the fog and they crash directly into Skull Island. As Denham and the crew film in what they believe to be an uninhabited place, they are attacked by the creepy (and I mean creepy) natives. What happens after I will not reveal in great detail, but safe to say there is a lot of roaring and chest-pounding involved.  <br /> <br />The digital Kong created by Andy Serkis and the wizards at WETA digital is as close to a real creature as possible onscreen. He always seems to occupy the same space as our characters, and his movement, look (is that real hair???), and uncanny emotion all make him completely believable. Jackson makes the choice to have Ann and Kong develop a two-way relationship, and as strange a choice as it sounds, it nonetheless works marvelously. You can't help but feel a little sad when the inevitable conclusion comes, if only because you understand Kong and empathize with Ann. That is the major triumph of this picture, and that is why I feel it superior to the two previous attempts to bring Wallace's novel to the big screen.  <br /> <br />But it is not the only triumph- this is, after all, an action film. And what thrilling action it is! As soon as our heroes hit the Island, all hell breaks lose. Vicious dinosaurs, disgusting and horrifyingly LARGE insects, and the power of Kong himself - in sequence after sequence. Although the film succeeds because it takes the time to have quiet moments, many will see \\"King Kong\\" primarily for the louder ones, and it doesn't disappoint. The demolition wrecked on the meticulously recreated 1930's New York city is particularly entertaining to me. Jackson lets his fertile imagination go wild here, and it pays big dividends for the audience.  <br /> <br />And the actors acquit themselves superbly as well. Naomi Watts plays Ann as thoughtful, resourceful, and slightly over-emotional, choices that work in the throwback context of the film while also keeping her grounded (and easy to identify with) as a character. Her job of acting against Serkis or interacting with the digital Kong is difficult and thankless, but because of her considerable acting talent it is also mostly seamless. Adrien Brody is better here than in anything else he's done since winning that Oscar, and Jack Black is...well, Jack Black. In a role that seems to have been written specifically to suit his gifts, Black is always funny as the frequently smug and sneaky Denham, but also reveals the depth in his character in his unending drive to exploit others for the sake of his own personal gain, including Kong. And though the supporting actors are mostly non-descript, considering the genre that's not such a bad thing. Even the last minute replacement score by James Newton Howard seems directly from the 30's - appropriate for the tone Jackson is shooting for - and even borrows some familiar cues from the original (with many other loving digs and homages to be found).  <br /> <br />So, minus a few not-quite-finished effects shots and a some (intentionally) hokey 30's dialogue, this epic version \\"King Kong\\" delivers on every level you ever could want of an adventure flick. Peter Jackson has often said the original \\"King Kong\\" is what made himwant to make movies in the first place, and after marveling at his own vision it's not hard to see why. By taking the time and effort to flesh out the characters and story first, and then applying the same care to the technological aspects, the film becomes more; it becomes a full-bodied experience. And a hair-tingling one, at that.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This is one album that should be listened to from beginning to end, as one long performance, NO passing or skipping songs NO!  <br />The order in which the songs are set up for this performance is perfect. The show starts out rocking and continues throughout with mostly prison related songs and quite a few trains thrown in for good measure. The show has comedy about getting caught and going to prison. A funny song about a mans last \\"25 minutes\\" before he is hanged, as only \\"The Man in Black\\" could do it live on stage in front of a highly captive audience of 2000 Folsom inmates and not only gets away with it, but gets loudly cheered! Johnny tells stories of Murder, Love, Loneliness, Prisoner Brotherhood, Betrayal, Cocaine, Trains and quite fittingly the last song Hope. Written by Glen Sherley an inmate at Folsom at the time, \\"Greystone Chapel\\" seals the deal so to speak as the show ends with this song of possible redemption and forgiveness even in prison.

B000A88F22|1.0|I've been a big Britney's fan since ...Baby One More Time, and I never cared her behaviour, I even liked the song \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" a lot, and I think I really admired her until she released the greatest hits album, which was ok, but the picture were on the border of porn, actually. Now, I've seen this reality (s**t) show on TV and I'm actually embarassed of watching it! I can't watch this without being ashamed of myself for being watching it...But this really made me open my eyes and realize that Britney Spears is nothing but a product. Clearly she would do anything for money, as we can see in this show. She really dissapointed me and right now I'm calling all Britney's fans to analize what are you watching. Is this the Britney we all admire?
B0001VTPWM|4.0|ROBOCOP: Five stars    ROBOCOP is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. ROBOCOP has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that.     Firstly, integral satire thumps hard at its core - big business is the new `democracy' (or lack of) and money is God. Falling human values and decency are humorously mocked (the family playing the `nuke' game) and the price of human life is devalued.     Robocop is a sort of iron messiah, almost Christ-like - for example, he is a morally strong man, gunned down doing something he believed in, was `resurrected' and eventually became an iconic figure for hope in a city falling into apathetic hell and crime.     The film is extremely violent, but it never seems gratuitously (there for the sake of it). The violence highlights the cold heartless vision of the future that our future relatives will inevitably inherit (are we not too far off now from that dystopia?) I saw this film on British television years ago, with censored `television-friendly' cuts. This made the film feel subdued in its message, and it lacked the brutal force of the uncut version (even the cutting of swear words gave the film a less realistic, less-grimmer feel).     Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armour suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his bolshy side-kick who also holds a high moral compass.     The stop-motion animation seems a tad dated (ED-209 falling down the stairs for example) even though it was made in 1987, but the sets are well-made and the difference between the urban decay below and the modern settings of the OCP buildings are well contrasted (the office buildings are grey and colourless, devoid of any human touches or character).     The intertwining news features, and faux advertisements, satirise a scrupulous modern media relationship with the `consumer'.     Apparently, Paul Verhoeven wanted a futuristic city created (see Starship Troopers) but budget restrictions forced him to settle for modern day looking Dallas. This works well in Verhoeven's favour, as the city feels deprived and the overall feeling is that this bleak future is not too far off.     The sequels and the TV spin-off (aimed at kids!), fortunately, does not devalue this movie, as this film stands alone. Some say it is the greatest sci-fi to come out of the eighties, I think it is the best to come out ever (alongside Metropolis, Terminator, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey), though people who think its gory violence is unnecessary, will disagree.      ROBOCOP 2: Three stars    The inevitable sequel is not as bad as some make out; though, compared with the original, it fails on all levels. Released with a surge of hype in 1989, this will fill only those who saw the first as a violent action picture, rather than the layered modern sci-fi it really is.    It's portrayal of a new drug culture offers nothing new, and seems pretty lazy and easy as a purpose to satirise. The villain, Cain, a sort of hippy throwback, seems a bit too much of a `superhero' villain (i.e. wacky, unconventional) to offer any gritty realism (unlike the first). Irvin Kershner, the director who gave us the most fulfilling Star Wars episode - The Empire Strikes Back, seems to lack the social and political bite that Verhoeven created with the first movie.    However, if you see the film in the right light - as a comic-book style movie, then ROBOCOP 2 is elevated somewhat. There are parts when satire does sparkle, for example, where Robocop/Murphy is `reprogrammed' and set back out onto the streets is a vicious swipe at OTT political correctness and liberalism(as the first movie took a swipe at conservatism and big business fascism).    The violence is not as brutal and realistic as the first one, but it is still far off the `children' friendly Robocop spin-offs that follow this movie.    News bulletins and faux advertisements return, but this time they feel too absurd, and instead of satirising modern western media, it simply parodies the first film.    I would rate this film three stars.      ROBOCOP 3: One star    If the second Robocop movie has some redeemable features, then the third instalment has hardly any. This film is the metamorphous of the Robocop franchise into a kid's marketed commodity. In this respect, this film seems to be a pilot for the children-friendly television series that soon followed (though this film is not be confused WITH the television show pilot).     The violence is low key and the inclusion of a child actor as one of the main central characters seems to confirm this. Maybe this was the inevitable conclusion - Robocop has all the hallmarks of a `superhero' and the commercialisation of this towards the children's toy market/comics may gather a new audience (young viewers) but will alienate an older audience at the same time. The superhero theme is cemented with Robocop's new jetpack and the `ninja' style villains (this movie was released when the ninja turtles franchise was in full swing).    It is ironic that this film should be included to make the series a `trilogy'. Parents who have seen this movie - and the television series - may find the first two films a total shock.    The film also lacks the budget of the first two movies, which was a surprise as Robocop 3 was very hyped up to its confusing release date (set back time after time with delays) and was released in Britain straight-to-video.    This film can be viewed as a pilot, of the pilot of the tv series. Parents who wish to buy this trilogy because of Robocop's `revamp' into a children's `action figure' toy may have an unpleasant surprise with the first two movies, so I suggest buying Robocop 3 on its own.
B000002JOH|5.0|alright first of all dimebag won't go down as a legend just cause he died. this motherfukker was the absolute king of metal guitar and his sh*t was untouchable. you ask any rock or metal guitarists and they will say dimebag was the sh*t! not only was pantera a great band they were one of the only metal bands to stick to their guns. straight thrash metal was all they put out throughout the weak ass trends that developed over the past decade of rock. dime's talents on \\"vulgar\\" are untouchable, just listen to the solo's and the grooves he rips it up. so stick to rating country boy and if pantera sucks to you then you don't know jack about metal.
B00003CXCT|4.0|No problems with the quality of the picture. Never before has the original trilogy looked so sharp and crisp. Never before has the sound seemed so rich and layered.    Never really bothered me about the added on CGI bits, except for two main parts:    1) Jabba the Hutt in the first one looks stupid and cartoony. He is supposed to be the most ruthless gangster going, yet Han stands on his tail and Jabba yelps (or whatever he does). They should of not included that part (or added it as a novelty 'extra' on the fourth disc).    2) The new dance scene in Jabba's palace is absurd and cringe-makingly out-of-place. The dark, smoke filled atmosphere is turned into a cartoon dance routine.    I also liked the original end Ewok theme, which was better than the new one. It would of been nice if Lucas had just cleaned the prints up and left it that - or give the fans an option to buy the 'original' films.    Empire Strikes Back, arguably the best of the three (and the six for that matter) remains relatively untouched. The print is cleaned up, dated-special effects errors corrected (transparency in the snowspeeder cock-pits). The only major change is a longer version of Luke versus the Wampa monster - this version is more terrifying for kids, as you see more of the monster eating Luke's transport.    Also, in Empire, the actress (apparently it was a woman with chimpanzee's eyes (superimposed) and Clive Revill's voice) who played the Emperor during the hologram communication is changed to Ian McDiarmid (who makes his first physical appearance in Return of the Jedi). Cloud City is revamped, though it looks a bit to fake and cartoonish compared with the original more ethereal set. Though compared with Star Wars: A New Hope and Return of a Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back escapes much of the `revamp.'    Despite the arguable flaws (some people may disagree and like the CGI Jabba) this box-set is still worth buying, it still feels like Stars Wars from yesteryear...well, most of the time.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I'm an old KoRn fan,and I think every album of this awesome band is special.Let's talk about the new one....it all started with Untouchables , that ambiental atmospheric sound,the album was hated and loved...this time See You On The Other Side is similar but has lost that KoRn power.Im very mad because the drums are replaced with the industrial ones..that really suck,Fieldy is now a regullary bass player,the rhythim is gone!A part of KoRn is really gone with Head.But The  Album is Full Of Hits...I mean no useless passages.Even the interludes are Divine.Let's face it...a band cant repet herself by making the same albums over and over again.We should appreciate KoRn for this courage...and it worths it.I lked very much Take A Look In The Mirror and I was wondering for how long they can squeeze the old style.I really thought KoRn was about to break....but they re here with a new sound..breaking the music limits again! <br />And as for that kid guy that wrote those useless reviews and has insulted KoRn...I think you don t know nothing about guitar originality and u re just a sick clishe lover if u talk about KoRn like that .All of you,those who don t like KoRn ,u should just have respect for THE ONLY ORIGINAL METAL BAND LEFT!!!BUY THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE COOLEST IN THE PAST 10 years!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Easily one of the best of 2005.  I'm ecstatic that there is someone out there under age 30 who is making original music.  Sufjan,  do Massachusetts next!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you like space ships and awesomeness, you'll have a blast.  The action is fresh and exciting.  The twists are genuinely shocking.  And the one-liners will actually make you laugh!  So many blockbusters feel like a lazy assembly line of explosions and pretty actor faces.  In Serenity, the characters are charming and cool, but also behave like real people, which is so so rare in a blow-things-up movie.  It's fun stuff. <br /> <br />Also, don't just take my word for it.  In addition to a million other great reviews, New York Magazine just named it one of the Top 3 movies of 2005.  They called it \\"The Year's Best Underrated Movie.\\"  And that's compared to ALL MOVIES, not just the ones in space. <br /> <br />Finally, it's been said before, but it bears repeating: If you sorta wished there was a Han Solo in these last three Star Wars movies... Serenity is a movie with all Han Solos.  I know that's high praise, but there it is. <br /> <br />Give it a shot, via Amazon or the rental racks.  I didn't expect to love Serenity, but I absolutely did.
B00000K3CK|5.0|If you were a child growing up in the fifties like I was you will certainly remember that there were three classic Christmas films that you had to see every holiday season. They were; 'A Christmas Carol' ('51), 'It's A Wonderful Life' ('47) and 'Miracle On 34th Street' ('47).<br /><br />'Miracle On 34th Street' is a charming, magical tale about modern day loss of innocence and joy and how one rotund old man with a white beard revives the \\"Spirit of Christmas\\" in an increasingly cyncial world. He sees little Susan Walker (Natalie Wood) as his test case. If he can't convince her that he is the real Santa Claus, all is lost.<br /><br />Will he succeed? Can he convince not only Susan, but the entire state of New York? Even more impossible, can he teach Susans' Mother (Maureen O'Hara) to open her heart and trust once again. Anything is possible at Christmast time!<br /><br />Edmund Gwenn is wonderful in the role of Kris Kringle and John Payne serves as the perfect foil and romantic interest for Ms. O'Hara. Director Geroge Seaton and an absolutely wonderful cast give the performances of a lifetime in this Christmas classic that belongs in everyones DVD collection.<br /><br />P.S.: I have to also mention the performance of Marlene Lyden as the Dutch girl who doesn't speak a word of English but wanted to see Santa anyway. This is without a doubt one of the sweetest moments ever put on film.
B000001FKY|5.0|I was introduced to rock by this album. Saw \\"Animal\\" video and was instantly hooked to the song and then to the album. Yes i agree with other people that its over produced and heavy riffs are missing. But as i said, there's something magical about this album. Remindes of good old days. Only song i hate like anything is \\"Excitable\\". Rest are awesome. 2 hard rockers, Dont Shoot Shotgun & Run Roit. 1 ballad -Love Bites. And 2 midtempo songs, Hysteria, Love and affection. My favorite from the 2 being Love and affection. Rest of the songs like Woman, Animal etc etc and specially the song which made Def Leppard famous, Pour Some Suger On Me, are all great.  <br /> <br />Other must haves: <br />On through the night <br />High N Dry <br />Retro Active <br />Slang <br />Euphoria <br />X <br /> <br />Avoid Pyromania and Adrenalize.  <br /> <br /> <br />* LONG LIVE DEF LEPPARD *

B00000IMTH|5.0|THIS is classic rock at it's best. Long Live Rock & Roll, Ronnie James Dio's third and final album with Rainbow, is a masterpiece of epic porportions, just like all of Dio's early work (w/ Elf, Black Sabbath, and Dio (Holy Diver,Dream Evil)). Every song on this record is worth listening to again and again. Try not to be humming the title track to yourself after hearing it. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!!!! The best songs on this record are the title track, L.A. Connection,  Gates Of Babylon (one of the top 10 best songs i've ever heard) and Kill The King. If you want to know what REAL MUSIC sounded like, pick this up. You will not be disappointed and if you are, then you don't like rock music. Plain and simple. LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL!!!!!!!!
0307276902|5.0|First, I finished this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. I have just left inpatient as well like James. I actually highlighted the parts in the book that I could identify with my experience. I didn't go along with all the rules and the bull \\"higher power\\" nonsense. Others may feel there is a higher power, but I do not. AA is centered on God, so this was hard for me.I felt every emotion he did, and felt comforted by his words, knowing that another person went through something as horrible as I did. I recommend this book highly for anyone who may feel that the normal stuff they shove down your throught with any AA associated program maybe isn't the final word. It is okay to not be a cookie cutter case. I know I'm not. <br /> <br />Great book, highly recommend it!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Regarding this album, this is fun, good music. Now, my real reason for writing this review: MARIAH AND MADONNA FANS! Please stop arguing over who is better. I have seen so many lies about Madonna printed in MARIAH reviews, and I have seen an even greater amount of lies printed about Mariah in the MADONNA reviews. The fact of the matter is this: they are both equally good, diverse from one another, yet similar. I'd like to use one example of lies I found in this section. A reviewer who calls himself Alex wrote a review entitled, \\"eheh!\\" on December 14, 2005. Now, I read this review and was appalled at the lies or perhaps lack of knowledge surronding this dispute. He wrote, \\"It makes me laugh the comparison with Mariah Carey... Madonna is the biggest selling female artist of all time...\\" This is just plain false. The biggest-selling female artist of all time is hands-down Mariah Carey, according to Billboard magazine, the most trusted source for all things music. His other comment was, \\"Europe=music, USA=hip/hop-rnb,\\" which is totally bizarre considering I frequently see very similar top ten lists for both areas. Anyway, the point is this: music is music; it doesn't matter if YOU like it, because it appeals to someone. That's the beauty of music. Alex went on to say that, \\"people can't choose\\" what gets radio airplay. This is inaccurate, because requests are what radio stations listen to more than anything. Mr. Alex further stated that it was not true \\"that Mariah carey had 4 top ten from emancipation....Ok, yes, she had them, but how much did they sell? zero. Radio decided it. You can't compare the chart achievements on billboard with no other chart, because european (and world) charts are selling charts, billboard is an airplay charts....question closed. US people is not free to buy a single, they're out of the picture.\\" Forgive me, but how stupid is this statement? First of all, Mariah has had only three top ten hits from \\"Mimi\\" and they sold. Very well. Radio didindeed decide to play the singles, but they refused to play her previous singles, so what makes you think they just decided to play Mariah Carey for a public that seemed lukewarm to her songs? Simple: REQUESTS!!! Furthermore, Billboard takes into consideration: radio airplay, single sales, and now even digital downloads. Alex, \\"We Belong Together\\" did not have twelve weeks on top; it had fourteen, not to mention a couple of weeks at number two. How much did it sell? You said, \\"zero,\\" but the fact of the matter is that it sold well over a million copies--highly unusual for a single. You stated that \\"Hung Up\\" by Madonna \\"sold tons of download, people paid for that, but it peaked at n. 7\\". Surprisingly--I mean, coming from you--these are both accurate statements, but \\"Hung Up\\" hardly broke into the top fifty songs at radio. Another thing: you said that \\"Mariah sold 4 million copies of emancipation....Madonna sold 4 million copies IN A WEEK!\\" Mariah has sold FIVE million copies of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\"--tied for the highest-selling title of the year with 50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\", which has been released for a longer period of time. \\"Mariah carey is nowhere near Madonna,\\" you say? Well, Mariah Carey has by far outsold Madonna--who started out more than SEVEN YEARS earlier than her. You went on to say that \\"Madonna sold 350000 copies and went to number one in US with a dance album....did you realize that?\\" Wow, this is true, and an impressive debut in a country of non-record-buyers, to say the least. However, Mariah's latest effort debuted at number one with over 400,000 copies sold in its first week, and it returned to number one again in June. Besides the fact, Madonna's album slipped from number one... to number four... to number nine... and is currently out of the top ten. Mariah's \\"Mimi\\" stayed in the top FIVE for MONTHS and is STILL sitting in the top ten. That's right: her rerelease has withstood Madge's original effort (which did do well, mind you). Might I also point out that it is purely dispicable for you to publicly insult Bush? Keep that to yourself (I believe you called him an \\"idiot\\"). What makes matters even more insulting to me is that you publicly bash the USA's president when you are not even from this country! At least someone from the US has more of a right to do that! What, you like it when Madonna's outspoken, but it's not okay for me to be? Returning to the subject at hand, you said, \\"mariah....yes, big big voice. The lyrics? ...ahah! I agree that madonna is not Bob Dylan, but telling that Mariah has better lyrics.....it's like saying that US is an open minded country!\\" This is purely outrageous, and I have read many reviews that have addressed Madonna's lyrics, which include: <br />\\"I love New York <br />Other places make me feel like a dork.\\" <br />C'mon. This is what Madonna has to stand up to the truly inspiring and emotional lyrics of Mariah? I am writing this in an angry way, not because I don't like Madge, but because I'm sick of people making fun of Mariah. You, Alex, are doing the same thing you want people to stop doing. I'm doing it now to illustrate your hypocrisy! So, please, Madonna and Mariah fans: DO NOT BE INSULTED BY ANY OF THIS. Both have written their fare share of remarkable songs... and... not-so-remarkable songs. And how dare you, Alex, insult the US again by saying we are not open-minded? I won't even get into this matter as of now! And how dare you say, \\"I hope you forgive my mistakes with the language and my not being american (of course, because US is not a racist country, right?)\\"? The US is probably the least-discriminative place you can go. Oh, there are some people, but women can't do anything in other countries. And races are treated fairly here, at least in the legal world; there are always disrespectful people... Anyway, if you care to hear the truth: MARIAH AND MADONNA ARE BOTH GREAT MUSICIANS, AMAZING INSPIRATIONS, AND CULTURAL PHENOMENONS. Both have had critically panned albums that did not do well; \\"Glitter\\" and \\"American Life\\" both sold about 600,000 apiece--a sales worst for Madge and Mimi. Both have had a great deal of number one hits; Mariah has had more with sixteen--likely to be seventeen next week as \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" heads for the top spot. Both have came out of their commercial-failure eras, and both have made a nice variety of music in exceptionally long careers. Why can't you love 'em both? I know I do, and I don't care what you musical \\"separatists\\" think. If you agree that this fighting ends now, please say that this review was helpful so more people will get the message. And please don't be offended, for I was pointing out lies to that ONE LYING FAN. I have much respect for Madonna and Mariah, and would never bash either. I know some of you will like one, some will like the other, and some will like both, but please understand why I did this review: I'm sick of people arguing over who has sold more, etc. and wanted the truth to be known, and for it to be understood that he acheivements of both are amazing, and that both artists should be respected and appreciated for astouding feats in a tough business. Both take a lot of crap from the press and angry citizens, but at the end of the day, don't worry about who has sold more, just enjoy their music! It's pathetic how far people will go to ruin someone, and fans of Madge and Mimi seem to be trying equally hard to ruin the other's career. Your constant bashing DOES NOTHING! It has no effect on people's perception of them, or on their sales, so... STOP. Take care.

If he joins them can he live with the consquences of the hideous attack Scorpia is planning on the city of London?<br /><br />I listened to this book instead of reading it so I did not have the luxury of lingering slowly over the last few pages. The end of the book is an absolute shock. Horowitz is definitely writing these books with a bow to Ian Fleming. As a reader of the original Bond books, I was struck by how much the end of this novel echoed the ambiguous endings Fleming often used.<br /><br />A set of Alex Rider books would make a great gift for a reader in your life.

With all of the realism of an early Martin Scorsese film such as Mean Streets, it was also the record that helped develop my appreciation for themes of darkness and protest in rock music, and thus probably also paved the way to my eventually checking out Dylan and various folk/blues/roots artists - everyone from Robert Johnson to the Fugs and the Weavers. And along with the realism, is the album's mythology, grounded in a decaying working class industrial world that barely exists anymore.<br /><br />Containing a bunch of my all time favorite Springsteen's songs, such as Candy's Room, Promised Land, Factory, and Racing In The Streets, the album, while bleak, also contains glimmers of home. Social and economic systems may fail, communities may become strained, but people can nevertheless find connections with others, whether it be with a girl named Candy, or with somebody else. Bruce convinces you that, in spite of everything, he does indeed believe in the promised land. I do too, in part from listening to this album.
0385484518|5.0|I had to read this book as a class room assignment for my sociology class and I wasn't looking forward to another boring assignment.  However I quickly became engrossed in Morrie's thoughts on life, love and dying.  The one quote that just really hit was,\\"Don't disregard every rule of your community.  I don't go around naked, for example.  I don't run through red lights.  The little things I can obey.  Buy the big things-how we think, what we value-those you must choose yourself.  You can't let anyone-or any society-determine those for you.\\"  This statement is so true, so much of the time we move through life without thinking, just functioning and doing what we are told. I now have a healthier preceptive of living my life instead of moving through my life in a daze.  The other thing that really hit home was Morrie's comment, \\"The biggest fault that human beings have is their shortsightness.  We all have the same beginning and the same ending. Death is as natural as life.  Death ends a life, not a relationship.\\"  It made me thing about how many times I say things as a matter of conversation, when they may truly be unkind or cruel comments about someone else. I am only 23, but after reading Tuesday with Morrie, I feel like I am 33.  There were alot of life's lessons written in this book and I would encourage everyone to read it.  Young or old, we can all stand to improve the way that we look at life, treating people with more kindness, saying the things that we should be saying to each other, making things count, instead of waiting until it is to late.  Read Tuesday with Morrie, now, don't wait. <br />
B000002URV|5.0|I think ENIGMA is the best. Not only that. The   M C M X C a. D. is the best CD of it. The music Sadeness is so great. Once you put it it will make you listen like over and over again. I mean who could not like ENIGMA and Sadeness? And I give it a five starts because its a great music to listen and dance and relax. <br />The best and the number music of the world !!!
0689877692|5.0|I'm a children's librarian.  Across the street from my library (located in the heart of trendy trendy Greenwich Village) is a high-end children's toy store.  On occasion, I'll walk by this store just to snicker at some well-meaning designer's attempts at reconciling the world of good design with the world of children's toys.  The result is a truly ridiculous store that no self-respecting child would dare be caught dead in.  There are mobiles in the style of Mondrian, rocking \\"horses\\" ala Carlo Mollino that are a single sinuous fold of wood, and toy houses that look like something out of Frank Lloyd Wright's notebooks.  In short, not a bloody thing a kid would actually find fun, but tons of pretty things to tempt their wealthy parents.  When I picked up \\"One Red Dot\\" I shuddered with recognition.  Here was a book that would fit in perfectly at that high-end children's store (and, no doubt, they sell plenty of copies there).  I read the premise of the book and flipped through it, safe and secure in the thought that obviously this was some kind of designer's paradise and not a pop-up book that would interest children.  WRONG!  Sure, it's good design.  Arne Jacobsen and George Nelson would be proud.  But unlike other grown-up-pleasing books of high-falutin' cleverness (as with David Pelletier's self-satisfied, \\"Graphic Alphabet\\"), \\"One Red Dot\\" is remarkable precisely because it is fascinating for children.  It's the best of both worlds.  A delightful romp through surreal pop-up landscapes and a great game of I Spy involving a single carmine sphere.<br /><br />Open the cover and there isn't a title page or an explanation of what you're about to see.  Instead, a large red box with multiple twisty tentacles, circles, and poking peculiarities rises up before your very eyes.  The page reads, \\"One perplexing puzzle box and one red dot\\".  You can peer into the box from above or peek into it on each side, where a different colored circle (white, yellow, black, or blue) meets your eye.  It takes a lot of hunting and pecking before the elusive red dot can be found.  Got the general gist of the book?  Good!  Because now we are off and running through a landscape of most peculiar and wonderful scenes.  The book acts like a little lap-sized museum.  We see twisty twirly gigs that spin multi-colored balls from limp black threads.  We pull \\"wiggle-wobble widgets\\" through rough red streams and then back again.  On one page the previously silent book is suddenly making a cacophony of cardboard gears, a single dot shining over the scene.  By the time you reach the \\"eight obedient orbs\\" you may have finally figured out that this is a counting book as well as a game of hide-and-seek.  By that time, however, you're too amazed by each scene to care WHAT the original intent of the book may have been.  The final image seems like nothing so much as the tree from \\"Waiting For Godot\\".  From it hang nine nines.  And somewhere, hiding amongst the curly branches, is one...red...dot.<br /><br />The book has far more in common with Shel Silverstein's, \\"The Missing Piece\\" than it does with pop-up books like those of Robert Sabuda.  In the past I've said that Sabuda is the best-known American pop-up artist.  This is in no small part due to his prolific nature.  Sabuda cranks out his books like they were going out of style.  Until now, David Carter has been content to create perfectly nice but not exactly awe-inspiring books.  His most interesting, prior to \\"One Red Dot\\" was his highly informative, \\"The Elements of Pop-Up\\", in which he broke down the art into easy to understand terms and diagrams (with a wonderful website to match).  To my delight, this is also the fellow who made that fabulous \\"In a Dark Dark Wood\\" pop-up book.  Sabuda could take notes on Carter's use of narration and story.  Then with \\"One Red Dot\\", he goes all fancy on us.  No longer is Carter toiling on \\"Bug Books\\" (I'm sure they pay the rent).  Now he's shown us exactly how fancy a pop-up book can be.  He's giving Sabuda a run for his money.<br /><br />Sabuda's books never include interactive elements like pull-tabs.  Carter, on the other hand, relies on them.  The results are mixed.  On the one hand, it's fun to pull the tab for the four flip-flop flaps.  On the other hand, the widgets on the opposite page won't take more than five or six pulls by grubby children's hands before they stop obeying so nicely.  I've kept this book in the Reference section of my children's room for about a month now and it has received very little attention.  Just the same, when I took it down to inspect it for a reviewing, I saw that the two-page spread of three burning baskets had already broken.  On closer inspection, it's clear that the middle basket was a bit too easy to break-off.  Hopefully future publications of this book will reinforce this image, since a broken basket sort of ruins the whole effect.<br /><br />The book's saving grace (aside from being easy on the eyes) is the red dot motif.  In many cases, Carter has just hidden the elusive circle away from the viewer so that it will only be found if the child tries to change his or her perspective and turn the book around.  Then again, I handed this book to a grown-up who said to me, \\"The red dot's only on a couple of pages, right?\\".  So finding it is hardly child's play.  With the primary colors, thick pages, and surreal grace, \\"One Red Dot\\" is a pleasure to people of every age.  You can't resent a book that is beautiful and also remembers how to be interesting to kids.  A perfect gift for any child, regardless of how many Saarinen \\"Tulip\\" chairs you find in their playroom.up book can be.

B00000IZOR|1.0|I was excited when I first bought this toy for my little one, because I had one when I was a child. I'll say one thing about it, it's cute and it looks like the old one, and it's durable. Most Fisher Price toys can withstand alot of abuse. But it's not as playable as the old one.  <br />First of all, the original was made of wood of course, and this one is plastic, but no problem with that, just thought I would mention that to anyone who thought it was exactly like the old one. <br /> The reason it's awkward for children to play with is because the reciever cord is very very short. The child will practically have to hold the whole phone up to his ear. <br />Whoever said that their child had the coiled cord wrapped around their neck was either lying trying for a lawsuit, or they had an actual older version. There is no way the coiled cord is going to wrap around anyone's neck unless it was a Barbie doll's neck. I'm assuming they shortened it for safety reasons. Okay, I understand that, but they left the pull cord long on it. A child could strangle themselves with the pull cord just as well as they could the reciever cord if it was long enough. So why shorten one for safety reasons but leave the other long? That is just stupid. My 1 year old won't play with this, because he won't pick up the whole phone to put the reciever to his ear. He gets frustrated with it. So really the only purpose it served was to bring back a childhood memory for me. I will probably wind up cutting the stupid 3 inch cord off of the darn thing so my baby can hold the reciever the right way. <br /> <br />So I only recommend this for someone who likes replicas of their childhood toys, or for someone who just likes cute toys to display on a shelf in their child's room. But I don't recommend it as a toy to play with.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Nothing beats seeing a show on stage but this comes close I was so glad to see so many faces from the original cast and the locations never took away from the scene itself I laughed and I cried and I can't wait to see it again I hope to see more theater in movie form since so many eople think the theater is only for snobs this at least reaches out to the masses BRAVO! and I hope to see more Maybe Wicked and Avenenue Q I also would love to see Deaf West's production of Big River on the big screen
B0000509C4|5.0|Creepshow 2 is an excellent movie. It involves 3 short stories, weaved together with a comic book feel. I have watched this multiple times, the best time to watch it is when you are relaxed. I like the style used to create this movie. 5 Stars.
B000002SE0|5.0|I was never an opera fan, less an Italian opera fan, and even less a Puccini fan. This recording is astounding. Incredible cast and phenomenal playing. The music is lush, fascinating, and exciting. <br /> <br />My advice, if you're getting into opera--look seriously at older recordings. Fancy sound is swell, pretty perfect voices are wonderful, but hell-for-leather recordings like this (which I honestly haven't found in recent history--and believe me I've looked) are what will cinch it for you. I believe it's the change in culture we're hearing, and here let me chart that change for you: think Jackie Kennedy at the Paris Opera House. Now think of Paris Hilton. This is what has become of just our young sophisticated socialite culture. Across the board it's pretty much the same decline. Who genuinely believes in Puccini any more?
B000067F7Q|5.0|This album kicks ass. I picked this one up after I heard the album 'Wages of Sin', and I like their older material better.<br /><br />This album is sinister, and full of dark imagery. If you like Arch Enemies 'Dooms Day Machine' .. well, pick this one up and realize the power possesed by this amazing group back in their early days.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is my favorite Arch Enemy album.
B0009XNUK0|1.0|i'm getting really tired of reading these michael jackson reviews giving him 1's over all that kid stuff. Sure, i agree thats pretty bad but this shouldnt be about personal opinions on the person it should be about music. Michael Jackson is one of the greatest enertainers ever, he basically made mtv and all these stupid jokes and comments are getting really old. This is a good michael jackson greatest hits,its got jackson 5 stuff, the jacksons stuff, and of course his solo hits, there may be a few left out but all in all if its a greatest hits you want,this is a good one.
0307263118|5.0|The book represents a wonderful expression of contemporary literary genius.  The reader is first struck by the writing style which is a nearly flawless and smooth finely honed construction.  The sentences have the beauty of Joyce with the simplicity of Coetzee.  Banville's uncanny ability to combine them into expressive portraitures is even more impressive than his ability to construct such wonderful language.  The construction of the book is as though it were one memoir. <br /> <br />The protagonist relives his life through Banville's book.  Yet the manner in which the highly stream of consciousness style is presented makes this fact unobvious.  The rapid temporal and character shifts tend to take the reader by surprise.  Once the reader becomes accustomed though and once the reader starts to gain familiarity with the characters, the style then underscores Banville's poignant retrospective. <br /> <br />All the way from childhood through adulthood and to a nursing home the protagonist takes us through the journey of his life.  He shows us his sorrows, deep and painful, and he shows us his joys.  He reveals the patterns of his life, and also the patterns of his impending death.  And he does this with extraordinary finesse and aplomb. <br /> <br />Banville has created a fine literary classic.  This book shall not be forgotten.  This book is distinctly, refreshingly and brilliantly unique.  It shall live on as a contemporary classic that is nonetheless, timeless. <br />
B00015TOCY|4.0|Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy~ Eno is a quite quirky fellow (and I mean this in a good way) whom does not let the rules of convention run his creative mind and will not let the music industry dictate his creativity. This album sounds like nothing that I have heard so far in my life and the closest that I can even compare it with is Smile (Brian Wilson), but it also has hints of Bowie. Eno is an acoomplished lyricist and has very accomplished vocals. I love the book-let but the decision not to include the lyrics is odd and confounding.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|When Peter Jackson stood upon the dais at the 2004 Academy Awards ceremony, surrounded by a record-tying 11 Oscars, and spoke of his next project, a 2005 remake of the 1933 classic, \\"King Kong\\", even some of his most devoted fans were worried. The last attempt to remake the ape epic had been the disastrously campy 1976 'update', which nearly sabotaged Jessica Lange's career at it's very start, and is best remembered today for it's gigantic robotic ape (which never worked properly), and World Trade Center finale (making the film heartbreaking to view, since 9/11).<br /><br />Even the concept of Jackson 'diving' into another 'major' project was unheard of; after all, it had taken Steven Spielberg four years to direct another film after \\"Schindler's List\\", and three, after \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", and \\"Titantic\\" director James Cameron hasn't made a 'dramatic' film since he won his 11 Oscars, in 1997. Certainly, it seemed that the diminutive New Zealander was rushing things, and had bitten off far more than he could chew, THIS time! The casting did little to allay fears; while Naomi Watts was an ideal choice, in Fay Wray's signature role of 'Ann Darrow', Jack Black, best known for 'over-the-top' comic portrayals, seemed a strange 'fit' as impresario Carl Denham, and Adrien Brody was, physically, about as far removed from Bruce Cabot's 'Jack Driscoll' as an actor could get. And even with Jackson's mastery of CGI, could his 'Kong' surpass Willis O'Brien's legendary stop-motion creation? Could Peter Jackson even do justice to the 72-year-old film classic, and not fall on his face?<br /><br />The answer is a resounding YES!<br /><br />The new \\"King Kong\\", at over three hours in length, is about as perfect a 'monster movie' as has ever been made, and is a feast for the senses. While clearly a homage to the original (even referring to Fay Wray, RKO, and producer/director Merian Cooper, in a humorous sequence), it takes what was patently artificial in the earlier film, and gives those moments such a sense of heightened reality that it even leaves modern 'genre' films, like \\"Jurassic Park\\", looking positively quaint. Compared to Jackson's horrific vision of Skull Island, Spielberg's dinosaur-infested islands are a Disney theme park ride! The 'wrap-around' opening and spectacular climax in 1933 New York City are equally amazing. Letter-perfect, they capture the 'feel' of Depression-era Manhattan to a degree that even films of the period couldn't achieve...and Kong's 'last stand' atop the Empire State Building will be talked about for years to come, as a technical marvel.<br /><br />Best of all, the story itself is actually an improvement over the original, without sacrificing those elements everyone loves. Carl Denham is still the opportunistic huckster embodied earlier by Robert Armstrong, but Jack Black adds elements of Orson Welles and P.T. Barnum to the mix, creating a character you can both love and hate. While Adrien Brody only shares the same name as Bruce Cabot's testosterone-fueled hero (portraying a playwright conned into the adventure), a new character (portrayed by Kyle Chandler), is introduced, Denham's 'leading man', who mouths the infamous 'un-PC' dialog (and is even named 'Bruce').<br /><br />The two leads of the story remain Ann Darrow and Kong, himself...and Naomi Watts and the CGI-created ape (pantomimed by Andy Serkis) are astonishing, together! Eschewing the sexual overtones of both the 1933 and 1976 versions, the pair bond out of loneliness and pain, creating a more 'human' friendship than either earlier \\"King Kong\\". The sensitivity of the relationship, in the midst of all of the chaos, is the glue that truly holds the film together...and makes the climax a heartbreaking, unforgettable experience. Both performances are certainly Oscar-worthy (quite a feat for a giant ape that doesn't even exist!)<br /><br />Peter Jackson has exceeded even the highest expectations with his vision of \\"King Kong\\", and while it is likely toonly win a few technical Oscars, it is, honestly, a better film than \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" (which, great as it was, doesn't stand 'by itself' nearly as well).<br /><br />What will the guy come up with next?stly, a better film than \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" (which, great as it was, doesn't stand 'by itself' nearly as well).    What will the guy come up with next?
0767817478|1.0|What the hell is that giant iguana!? And Why is he walking around with Godzilla's name?! The real Godzilla was an unstoppable force of nature. Nothing in man's artillery even fazed him. The only thing that stopped him was an unknown chemical compound that was so dangerous that its inventer destroyed his research papers and sacrifised his life for peace. GINO(the fake Godzilla aka Godzilla In Name Only) was stoppable with man's modern artillery, the only real abilities he has besides being a giant mutant Iguana walking on two legs is being able to blow out \\"Atomic\\" wind from his mouth(instead of fire), and being able to reproduce asexually(why am I calling it a he?) GINO didn't symbolize what  Godzilla symbolized either. If GINO symbolizes anything, he symbolizes what he is, a giant iguana. In fact, in the movie he seemed to be more of a pest than a problem, really. Tri-star pretty much killed Godzilla in this movie.

The story will hit the hearts of every child and adult.<br /><br />You will believe after watching this classic.<br /><br />Basically the plot is about a boy who questions whether Santa Claus is real. He hops aboard the Polar express to the North Pole to find Santa Claus's home on Christmas Eve. A cast of categorized kids are along for the ride of their life.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my kids. (Nine, seven and two) I was skeptical of the all digital characters at first, but that quickly faded as the story developed. The nine year old questioned the funny looking kids too, but I said it was a movie magic and that was the end of the questions. They were hooked. I especially was surprised by my two year old who sat through the entire film. Now that is movie magic.<br /><br />I got hood winked into feeling the emotions of the kids on the train. Before long I was shedding a tear along with my kids. I BELIEVE I have to give this DVD a must buy.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|some musicians express their genius in the complexity of the music they produce. others express it in the simplicity of their work. \\"making movies\\" is an example of the latter and though the music initially comes across like plain and simple rock n roll, unlike the subtlety of the first album or the prog experimentation of \\"love over gold\\", with a   few listens its hidden genius unfolds.    though a staunch fan of dire straits, for a long time i didn't bother to pick this one up. yes, i'd noticed that several of this album's tracks feature in greatest hits packages, but still for some reason or the other, i always avoided it (who knows why? maybe the song titles didn't grab me!).    then one day i picked it up. after a few listens, was i in for a surprise! this was really classy stuff. except for the last song, les boys, every single track is a killer here. the extended fret work on 'tunnel of love', the mischevous 'romeo and juliet', the popular 'skateaway', the highly charged 'expresso love', the sentimental 'hand in hand', the 'solid' rock - the album hands out the goodies one after another.    this album amongst other things also signifies the maturing of mark knopfler as a serious lyricist. in his guitar work the country/rockabilly influence is marked. and roy bittan does make a difference with his tasteful keyboard work.    after a few years of listening, it is only this album which has stood the test of time for me, along with their eponymous debut.    if you've not bought it yet, you dont know what you're missing!
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I saw this movie, and fell in love with it. This is by far the greatest movie of 2005, much much better than Star Wars episode 3, I'm a fan of Star Wars, but that movie blew, it had great acting, great music, and amazing effects. Joss Whedon can truly be happy about this movie. The movie had me laughing one minute, tense with anticipation the next, and then crying. Even through my tears this movie made me laugh constantly, Joss is a comic genius. He managed to get the feel of the show, put a darker twist on it, and then give it back to us for Christmas. I give this the hightest recomendation, if you don't see it you are missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Usually I don't buy movie soundtracks, but this one is too good to pass up. And it is a show of support for this remarkable movie. Most of these songs are about deep and true sentiments but the overall feel of the album is not over-sentimental.    The lyric of the first tune, \\"A Friend of Mine\\", fits the plot of the movie like it was written for it. The other covers (especially, the whimsical \\"King of the Road\\") are lighter (even fun) tunes that balance out the heavier stuff. The original songs written for this movie are the best -- truly sublime! You can even say \\"A Love That Will Neve Grow Old\\", \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Say Goodbye\\" are Jack's songs for Ennis, while \\"I Will Never Let You Go\\" and \\"The Maker Makes\\" are Ennis' songs for Jack. They really evoke the core sentiment of the movie. The instrumental pieces are like the landscape of Wyoming from which these songs of human yearnings take shape.
B0000D96NW|5.0|More than anything, the main reason I enjoy this album is because of the powerful messages in each of the songs: \\"don't give in, don't give up\\", \\"I will fight for those I love, I will fight for those I care\\" are just a few of the awesome lines you will discover. I just cannot get enough of it. I listen to this c.d. every time I have a bad day for strength, or on normal days just for inspiration. No other metal album I own can do that for me.<br /><br />Besides the powerful song writing, this album is heavy, really heavy. Simply put, the kind of heaviness that makes you clench your fist, grit your teeth, and nod your head slowly, kind of heaviness. The sonic guitar solo's on songs like \\"Vim\\" and \\"Seasons Whither\\" are incredible. The drumming in every song is so precise and distinctive, you can hear spaces between drum beats, which adds to the heavy sound I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Although I do not own any other Machine Head albums, I can assure you that negative comparisons with their previous albums ultimately cannot take away from the excellence of Through the Ashes of Empires, one of the mightiest metal albums ever created by a group of artists, music and lyrics.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|Just a few words about the cover art for this DVD;<br /><br />Compare it to the sober, tasteful, esthetic, and mystic cover artwork for the import edition, DUNA. (Referring to \\"Dune Definitive Collection 2 DVD Set [Import] (1984)\\" with the blue moons.)<br /><br />This US edition is a typical example of what happens when producers are in charge, and always have the final word. Their goal is foremost to sell and make as much money as possible; not to make an esthetically pleasing product. In Hollywood they are often speculative hustlers, as opposed to real Artists. Here they have squeezed in as much information as possible into the picture; all characters are crammed in. Details all over the picture. It's just chaotic and ugly. Unbalanced.<br /><br />It's the same thing with the new Star Wars films packages. The foremost thought and motivation is to sell. (But of course, at the same time there are great artists who have contributed to these films! People who manage to present their visions, untainted by producers' restless clumsy hands. But that is another matter.)<br /><br />Things were better when the artists themselves were in charge of design, before the commercially speculative producers took over everything around the early 1980s or thereabout .<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />P.S. To all of you who have given negative feedback to this review: You simply don't understand how fooled you are by the commercialized film industry! It's a sad state to see the large masses being brainwashed.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I recently purchased Resident Evil: Deluxe Edition from Amazon.com. Having never seen this film before, I realized that I played a gamble with this DVD. However, I think I did alright.<br /><br />For 11.49, you really can't go wrong. This film features non-stop action, suspense, and a semi-decent plot to go with the flow of the film. Mind you, the plot has the structural integrity of a block of swiss cheese. But, bear in mind that Resident Evil is not a film that was made with the intention of getting nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />Movies of this genre require only 2 things:<br /><br />1) A beautiful female lead who knows martial arts and can manipulate a 9mm with the finesse of a Parisian street artist (that is a compliment).<br /><br />2) Lots of on-screen death and destruction. Resident Evil is chock-full of \\"#2\\". Zombies are shot at, kicked at, punched at, and even head-butted at one point I think.<br /><br />Grab the popcorn and Coke. Dim the lights, and turn up the sound. For 12 dollars, I do not think you will be disappointed.<br /><br />5 solid stars. Not for quality, but for pure entertainment value. Do NOT expect deep, thought-provoking dialogue, and thematic material from this film.<br /><br />DO expect one hell of a ride....and with Milla driving, you'll definitely be in for a treat!

Without a doubt, this DVD is a must-have.<br /><br />Great entertainment value! Very sleek stylized action with a very beautiful female lead. Kate Beckinsale definitely enters the role of Selene like a perfect fit.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviews here, I cannot tell you, the reader, the difference between the Unrated and the original Rated version. Watching the Unrated version was my FIRST time watching this film. I have to admit, the film seemed to have a relatively solid plot. The story worked for this kind of movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed this DVD immensely. I bought it on sale for 15.97. And for that price, I would be hard-pressed to find another deal better than that...unless you were to purchase a used version.<br /><br />...and yes, the DVD case/cover is very 'cool'.
1400031087|4.0|A Million Little Pieces- a book with many stories that becomes one story.  The story of James Frey's life.   <br />James Frey is a drug and alcoholic addict he over comes his addiction by himself with help with his friends and family at a rehabilitation clinic.  While James is there he meets many friends that help him understand the meaning of his life.  As James is at the clinic and he falls in love with a wonderful girl.   <br />The novel of a million little pieces has a lot of imported words, but this book is a book that has a lot of really good detail and informs you of all of his problems.  <br />The reason why this book is so neat is because the author of the book is the person that went through all these problems. <br />I believes that this book if four any older person from high school on up that need to hear someone else storey that is much worse that there life is.  I something helps to hear someone story so you can relate to it.  <br />
B0000DBJDM|1.0|This DVD would be good for real hard core fans for historical purposes. It is not a concert. Most of it is filmed in the studio while workinjg on an album. The guys don't know what to do or say. You see them smoking cigarettes and eating. A total diappointment to me. A rip off if you expect music.
0393324818|5.0|This is one of the best sports books I have ever read, and I really liked the way that it described the part of baseball that fans don't usually see. I think that the book portrayed Athletics General Manager Billy Beane in a great way as a smart man. This book showed that you need technology to be a General Manager, and it takes someone smart, not just any regular Joe. It showed that the GM isn't the only one who does something, his assistants are important. This is one of the greatest sports books of our time. <br /> <br />Mid-Prairie Teen who likes sports very much. <br />
B00006LI4S|1.0|This performance is mediocore. There is really nothing outstanding about it. Gilmour's own material is boring. His Floyd music is uninspiring. No real light show or special effects. Not worth the money.
0767817478|3.0|I enjoyed this film when it first came out. The only problem is The monster isn't Godzilla. I've seen their first designs of the monster for this film and it totally looks like Godzilla, they should have stuck with those. Instead they made him into a giant weak lizard. What I did like about this monster is that it did move like a dinosaur. The crew said they tried to make it more like \\"The Beast from 20,000 fantoms\\" which was the Grandfather of Godzilla. If that was the case, they should have called it \\"The Beast\\". But this film wasn't bad.
B0000012YO|5.0|Beethoven piano sonatas have come with me for long time, I even can't remember the first time I listened the Hammerklavier. I've heard many issues of these sonatas, maybe more than 20, but just want to make a comparision between 4 best pianists: Schnabel, Arrau, Richter, and Gilels. <br /> C. Arrau has been thought as Beethoven's messenger. He played all Beethoven concertos and sonatas perfectly, smoothly. But in here Arrau seems lacking of agressive and unique. By contrast, A. Schnabel played faster and stronger. Especially in Hammerklavier, Schnabel raised his voice to the tempest in the simple notes. First time I listened to S. Richter in Adagio movement of Hammerklavier, all statues of my favorite pianists playing this sonata had collapsed. His sound like drops of crystal, slowly and slowly. But just only Gilels can make you feel all of emotions: happy, sad, agressive, calm... You can smile and cry with Gilels Hammerklavier. <br /> If you want to listen to Beethoven sonatas, this box set is the best one. Actually, it just has 29 sonatas, other 3 (No.30, 31, 32) can find from S. Richter (but very rare now).

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This re-issue of Jame's Cameron's magnificent film \\"Titanic\\" contains many extras that will delight this movie's legions of fans. From the wonderful song performed by Celine Dion to a detailed breakdown of the movie's many scenes much is offered here over the original release.<br /><br />While many criticize the script for this work as insipid I do not. From the beginning when  a turn of chance takes our hero Jack to the ship and thence to his great love I was enthralled. I also greatly admire Mr. Cameron for the courage and imagination of vision that led him to undertake a perilous underwater visit to the wreck of the fabled liner. He shot his own underwater footage. The imagination and effort that went into the sets to create the very real illusion of sinking is nothing short of truly amazing. This movie was (and still is ) knocked by some critics for its lack of \\"substance\\". I could not disagree more. The viewer's themseves have voted and the verdict was and is overwhelming. The \\"Titanic\\" has justly earned it's position as one of the greatest cinematic efforts in the history of film.  [[ASIN:B00079RC1E The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass]]
B00005V3Z4|4.0|After watching `Donnie Darko' for the first time, I was entirely confused.  What were they talking about with time travel, tangent universes, and worm holes?  I have no interest in science fiction and couldn't begin to de-tangle the intricacies of this film's plot.  But guess what.  That didn't really matter.  I still really enjoyed `Donnie Darko.'  (Incidentally, the plot - at least the *probable* plot - has been explained to me since my first viewing ... kudos to anyone who figures out what's going on for her/himself).  Anyway - my point is - you don't have to know precisely *why* a plane's engine crashes through Donnie Darko's bedroom ceiling, and you don't have to know *why* that creepy, giant bunny is lurking around the corner to like this movie. <br /> <br />What is likeable about this movie?  To begin with, as almost every other reviewer has pointed out, Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job with the role of Darko.  His character is extremely intelligent, cynical, slightly demented and ultimately charismatic - he reminded me a lot of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye - - which is actually an odd coincidence, considering that, in `The Good Girl,' Gyllenhaal plays a character who renames himself Holden and identifies with Salinger's protagonist.  Anyway - just a thought.  While almost all of the characters in the movie are likewise enjoyable and are brought to life by talented actresses/actors (Patrick Swayze as a motivational speaker/pervert? - well done!), I have to agree with another reviewer: Drew Barrymore is atrocious as a high school English teacher.  She is entirely unconvincing and reminds me of a female Keanu Reeves (at his worst).  Anyway ... <br />      <br />I also like this movie because, while I did not exactly \\"get\\" what was happening, it is never boring.  The plot is definitely unique, dark and subtly humorous.  The scene with Darko, his uptight Health teacher (I think she was a Health teacher) and a \\"Life Line\\" is hilarious.  Moreover, I think that, in general, the relationships in this film are treated in a very nuanced manner and with a great deal of tenderness.  Darko and his older sister (played by Gylenhaall's real-life sister Maggie) demonstrate an especially endearing - albeit playfully hostile - dynamic. <br /> <br />Lastly, I think one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack.  There are several great 80s songs - all very nostalgic, moody, brooding, and sexy.  They fit in perfectly. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend giving `Donnie Darko' a shot.  It's unique, it'll probably leave you thinking (at least: 'what just happened?!?') and I think most people will enjoy it.
0440539811|5.0|I brought this book and a plethora of other books with me on a family road trip. End result I read all of The Illuminatus! Trilogy and pretty much ignored my other books. If I had to use one world to describe this book it would be mindf**k. A Midget, dolphins, JFK, a parody of Ayn Rand, a pimp, a crazed anarchist billionaire of the sea, conspiracies, Jesus Christ,  John Dillinger, Libertarian women who know what they want, religious fundamentalists that would make Jerry Falwell blush, and even Satan. Its got all this and a bag of Fnord. <br /> <br />Buy this book down or else you will feel the wrath of the 3 eyed ones.
B00008EY9G|1.0|Spoiler follows... as if anything could spoil something this lame.  Do I actually have to award any stars at all? What a waste of a star.  Dang!<br /><br />The previews looked great. I was really looking forward to this stellar, star-studded cast in a *ah-em* \\"film\\" full of atmosphere.  So,  this film LOOKS great; it is wonderfully shot.  The acting is very good.  That's the best I can say for it.  It's the story stupid.<br /><br />This *ah-em* \\"film\\" actually left me feeling angry and cheated when I saw it in the theater and I can only think of one other film I'd ever seen that left me angry and feeling cheated:  \\"History of the World Part I\\"<br /><br />I'm very surprised that Liotta and Cusack agreed to do this... did they even read the entire script?  Anyone who gives this movie more than two stars does not know anything about tension, suspense, mystery, and plot development.  If I had to vote for the lamest thriller of all time this would surely be it (DeNiro's Hide and Seek is a close second).<br /><br />There's a point in the movie where any astute viewer will say to himself or herself \\"oh, this is all in somebody's head\\"  At that point, anyone with half a brain realizes there isn't a real character to invest in, i.e., worry about.  You can't invest yourself emotionally in someone who is a just make-believe person in some nut-job's head, no matter how nice or attractive the make-believe person might be.  Who really cares if the make-believe person in the nut-job's head gets carved up or pick-axed to death?  \\"Oh no!  Look out little figment of the nut-job's imagination, the killer is right behind you!  Run little figment of the nut-job's imagination, run!\\"  Paaaaahleeeeze! There are no characters to invest in so the premise does not work.  This was so stupid I'm surprised to find myself writing a review.  Note to self: \\"how stupid am I for wasting my precious time writing a review for something that was so stupid?\\"  The fact that this *ah-em* film appears to have garnered an average of 4 star reviews is the only plot twist this *ah-em* film has going for it.  I mean, I knew the general public were easily pleased but COME ON FOLKS.  This was lame!  Lame Lame LAME!<br /><br />A few months later I saw the movie (DVD) Apathy (I think that's the title) with Nick Cage.  That particular film was actually released earlier than Identity.  Cage's character has a brother who keeps talking about making a movie that takes place in someone's head and Cage's character considers totally stupid.  The plot described for that make believe movie idea is what became Identity in real life.  I had to laugh right out loud when I realized someone had tested the concept. Average movie-going audiences sure are stupid.

B00005JO1J|5.0|This movie is fantastic. It's a great substitute for the live show if you can't see it on stage and a wonderful souvenir for fans who want to relive the experience without having to shell over $50 and up for a seat. I will definitely buy the DVD when it releases. There were two things that that made this film magical for me. The first thing is the 3-dimensional, real world stage that RENT is filmed on. The stage show is basically one set but the movie has a real loft, a real performance space. They even made a Catscratch Club! It was so cool to see songs like \\"Out Tonight\\", \\"Tango Maureen\\", & \\"One Song Glory\\" expanded into these lavish production numbers. And even with all the various enviroments it still retains the essence of the stage show.  <br /> <br />The second bonus was the fact that most of the film cast was comprised of the original stage cast. To see Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Jesse L. Martin, etc. reprise their roles was a blessing since I missed them on stage. I was worried about Rosario Dawson as Mimi but she did a great job (thank God) and the new Joanne was awesome too. I don't understand all the talk about the actors looking \\"aged\\". Who did the critics want to see? Hilary Duff?! The cast looked pretty vibrant and energetic to me. The actors' ages were the last thing on my mind when watching this film. I was too busy following the story and being awed by the musical performances to worry about who had the most crow's feet. I am just so grateful that I now have the faces to match the voices on the original cast recording of the RENT soundtrack. Yes! <br /> <br />A few criticisms like the sometimes wooden performances where the actor looks like he/she is focusing way too much on the lip synching and less on the emotional presentation. Like during the fight scene/song between Roger throws Mimi out of his apartment. I wish Adam looked as angry as his voice. Or maybe his hair was covering his anger? Luckily this incident happens rarely in the film. And asa huge fan of the soundtrack it was a little odd when some of the lines sung in the show or spoken in the film. Like when Collins visits Mark & Roger and offers them Stoli. It was supposed to be sung not spoken. It didn't hurt the movie very much but as a fan it took getting used to. Overall, this film was worth the wait and I'm glad that it's finally here and I'm ecstatic that it was done so well. Now hurry up and put this on DVD so I can watch it over and over at home!
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|I really liked this movie. I was not a Brad Pitt fan until this movie. He was wonderful in this movie. He seemed so heartless at first then his true self comes out. Wonderful acting. Orlando Bloom's image is tarnished in my eyes now because all the death and destruction occured because of his whinny self. He should have never done this character! He will now be protraid as a bigger whimp in all his future movies even more so then his past performances. I just wished the Trojan King would have listened to his son's instead of the leaders of his whatever you call it and they would have been alive. The ending is truely sad but it is somewhat close to Iliads version (ending only). Overall the movie is a tear jerker and a must watch again in my opinion. I've seen it about 25 times since it came out on cable.  <br />
B0001611DI|5.0|this movie completly restored my love for \\"zombie\\" movies.  i saw parts of this when i was little and the mall scenes stuck with me over the years.  After finally buying this, I couldn't get enough of it!  I watched it everyday for more than a week!  This movie couldn't have been made today(and remakes suck) so this is classic.
0316776963|2.0|As David Sedaris relishes reminding the reader on every page, he may be a homosexual, but he is certainly not gay.  In fact, much of Mr. Sedaris's book seems to reflect a determination to destroy every stereotype, every prejudice, that the biased reader may carry about his demographic.  If such a reader picks up this book assuming that he will be reading of a sunny fellow, respectful of the arts, of learning, of variety, of new experiences, that assumption won't last for long. The author is grouchy about pretty much everything, and the more something is alien to his personal customs, the less he likes it. <br /> <br />You might think that I disliked this book because I dislike the curmudgeonly style of humor; but you'd be wrong. I quite enjoy a good curmudgeon, the operative word being \\"good\\".  An Edward Abbey or a Bill James or a Mark Twain can be quite caustic, but with a difference.  These other curmudegeons are judgmental of the rest of humanity mainly because they possess a particular vision of how the world should be, and humanity isn't holding up its end of the bargain.  But Sedaris doesn't really seem to know what he wants; one detects no alternative vision.  The reader only knows that pretty much everything irritates him. <br /> <br />Between the covers of this book, the author derides every subject under the sun:  performance art, teachers, students, well-meaning but misguided fathers (well, one anyway, the author's own, whom I pitied), computers, boorish tourists in New York City and in Paris, and haute cuisine, among others. <br /> <br />What he actually likes is less clear.  At one point he contrasts the old typewriters favorably with today's computers, and not very convincingly.  If computers didn't exist, one suspects that Sedaris would be writing pieces complaining about stuck keys, papers dislodged from the roller, or typos created just as he was completing a page.   <br /> <br />He also seems to like his siblings somewhat, but only because they join in tormenting his beleaguered father, with their profanity and their dress. <br /> <br />All of which would be forgiven if Sedaris were really that funny.  But he isn't.  He rather reminds me of that girl who sat in the back of one's middle school class, rolling her eyes, making fun of everyone and everything.  A few other kids think her act is amusing, but for the rest of us, it wears thin quickly.  Usually that girl didn't have much to offer on her own, it was her way of fighting her own demons.  Which seems to be the case here.  Ridicule and wit are two different things. <br /> <br />Not that it's all bad. The chapter wherein Sedaris confronts a, uh, well, shall we say, a \\"deposit\\" left behind by the last user of the bathroom is pretty funny.  And there's an occasional, very occasional, wry phrase along the way. <br /> <br />But most of the pieces are rather mean-spirited diatribes.  You can almost sense him lying in wait to lampoon the visitor from the hustings to New York City, dissecting her every word and move so that he can project superiority.  So too with the boorish Americans he meets in Paris.  If neither existed, he would have invented them, and for all we know, he might have. <br /> <br />Sedaris might seem to have some standing to be judgmental of others if he himself didn't come off as so closed-minded.  The chapter on food is classic; he spends the whole piece complaining about how there are too many novel ingredients, piled too high on his plate.  Memo to David Sedaris:  New York City does serve Big Macs for those who want them. <br /> <br />I rate this a 2 rather than a 1 because it's an easy, light read.  I did smile once or twice.   <br /> <br />But mostly I wanted to finish the book, take a shower, clear my mind of it, and then to read something more uplifting. You know that girl I mentioned in the back of your middle school class?  You hang around with her too long, and pretty much you're rolling your eyes, too, and mocking everyone and everything you come across.  This book made me want to get away from Mr. Sedaris and to hang out with someone I liked a lot more. <br /> <br />
B00005JM0B|5.0|Jonathan Mostow outshines Cameron with this film. The first 2 terminator films were ok, but what was missing was some decent thought provoking story line to capture the imagination.  Mostow demonstates this with an awesome ending to T3.  Its good that Cameron let the franchise go, because really it needed a director that knew what he was doing to bring T3 back from the dead.  Better acting as well in this film, overall, 5 stars!
B00005JO1Y|4.0|A truly great film and remarkably worth every cent to go see.... Kong was as good as I could have imagined and truly came to life. Naomi Watts' performace was top notch..  and she is without a doubt extremely attractive and the perfect actress for the role. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I was let down by Jack Black's hollow, weak and unconvincingly creepy performance as Carl Denham. This was very unfortunate, as every other aspect of this new film stood it's own. This Carl Denham was hollow and unconvincing. The continuous creepy stare thrown in at every opportunity did not illustrate a man of obsession, but more a psychotic lune. On top of this Jack Blacks line readings were understated, ineffective and unconvincing. <br /> <br />In EVERY other way, this film delivers. Any film that can deliver so much emotion and attachment to a 25 foot Gorilla has something special to recognize. Kong is truly a tragic character in this film and as such Peter Jackson has done what hasn't been done since 1933. We feel for Kong and BELIEVE every bit of codependence between Ann Darrow and the Ape. This, in itself, makes a beautiful film. <br /> <br />And as may be expected, the special effects are amazing. Kong is, in every way REAL. Although the biplane sequences and a few car shots were flawed, Skull Island was a gem in filmmaking. <br /> <br />See King Kong. A great new film, standing proudly beside the '33 Original.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|...Yes,HUNG UP it's a techno-pop kind of song,something that bodes pretty well around the world , but tends to be overlooked in the US; I mean, when was the last time that a techno-like song hit the US top 10? I think it was 3 years ago when Madonna's DIE ANOTHER DAY was #8.Even Kylie 's CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD(very decent 2002 pop ditty),couldn't surpass the # 7 in the US Billboard, despite that it was scorching the airwaves all over the world back then being #1 in many places. <br />Yes. US airwaves are absolutely dominated by R&B and Hip Hop,this monotony is only disrupted by the occasional ballad that always makes it to the top ( though rarely to the #1...The Reason...Boulevard Of Broken Dreams...Behind These Hazel Eyes...Photograph)Look,to prove my point I will show you the top 10 for this week according to Billboard-meaning 2 R&B songs +6 Hip Hop songs+2 ballads(2!): <br />10-Kelly Clarkson/ because of You(a ballad,there always seems to be 1 soft-rock ballad around in the US countdown...) <br />9-Black Eyed Peas/ My Humps(a fun hip-hop-ish song) <br />8-Eminem/ When I'm Gone(the guy mentions his wife and daughter by name and not for the first time...in an angry-toned rap song...yawwwwwwwwwwn) <br />7-Pussycat Dolls/ Stickwitu(An intendedly sexy R&B song) <br />6-Kanye West& J Foxx/ Gold Digger(Finally a vibrant song takes over the #1 in Billboard for several weeks! Still...hiphop) <br />5-Nickelback/ Photograph(This is how this song reminds me of...well you know what other Nickelback song...the mandatory exception rock-ballad in this countdown..2 ballads this time, variety?) <br />4-Nelly Paul Wall/Grillz (The southern new sound of Hip Hop) <br />3-D4L/ Laffy Taffy( Upbeat hip hop song) <br />2-Mariah Carey/ Don't Forget about Us( doesn't this song sound surprisingly the same than Shake It Off? which sounded the same than We Belong Together? Which itself sounded like tens of other Mariah songs?...yep, the queen of R&B still performing acrobatics withher voice yet managing to avoid novelty) <br />1-Chris Brown/ Run It(This song is sooooo generic that my humble brain still can't assimilate why it is even #1!) <br /> <br />So...Madonna made it to the #7 in Billboard with Hung Up...wow...She 's eons old, she 's not into the hiphop thing (the Rap in American Life was suppossed to be tongue-in-cheek...I guess it sounds a lot better when english is not your first language...actually it sounds fantastic when you understand english but as a 2nd language!) and still manages to get into the US top 10...wow! <br />This is a beautiful happy boombastic album, even so, its singles will be in an uphill battle when it comes to fight in the closed-minded US charts, where phenomenal acts like  Chemical Brothers, Franz Ferdinand,and even popular acts like Robbie Williams are doomed for not fitting the mold. <br />The songs in this album are optimum companions for many party moments in this christmas around the world...super cool album,buy it, download it ,steal it, borrow it..but anyways..play it! <br /> <br />
0060763280|1.0|Absolutely the worst book of its kind I have ever read.  It will have appeal only to those who have no understanding of the principles of money management and wealth accumulation, those who can least afford the book and the \\"programs\\" it advertises. <br /> <br />The only sound bit of advice I found was on page 1, paragraph 1: \\"Don't believe a word I say\\".

B00005JO1Y|4.0|When I first heard that Peter Jackson was making a modern version of the 1933 classic \\"King Kong\\", all I could think of is the atrocity of the late '90s version of \\"Godzilla\\". I thought it would be a disaster. Thankfully I was wrong. Peter Jackson took some great care in the making of the film. Casting Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow was a smart move. Naomi has that classic Hollywood look that you just don't see in most film stars nowadays. Hiring Adrian Brody to play Jack Driscoll was a highly unusual choice but it worked. The only miscast was Jack Black as the ambitious, misguided Carl Denham. Jack Black was totally wrong for this role. He just got on my nerves as did his eyebrows.<br /><br />As the story goes, Carl Denham is trying to get his latest film project off the ground. He wants to film his movie on a mysterious island After losing his first actress of choice, Carl accidently comes across Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudville actress. Once he has his cast and ship crew put together, they set sail for what everyone thinks is Singapore. What they find is Skull Island. It doesn't take long for the film crew to stumble upon the inhabitants of Skull Island and some of its wild life, namely zombie-looking people and a gorilla named King Kong.<br /><br />Unlike the 1976 turkey starring Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges, this latest King Kong version follows the path of the 1933 classic but more detailed. The film starts off very slowly but I have to admit it does an effective job in telling the story of the characters and how they met. The other flaw is the obnoxious film score which I found to be annoying and overwhelming. Is it really necessary for music to be in every single scene in a movie?<br /><br />The real star of the film is King Kong himself. He may be computer generated but he is very realistic in terms of facial expressions, and body movements. His battle scenes with the dinosaurs, bats, and airplanes were nothing short of spectacular. King Kong's interactions with Ann Darrow were my favorite scenes, especially in the last half hour of the film.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" definitely could have been shorter. Two and a half hours at the most, three was a bit indulgent and too much for this filmgoer. Pound for pound, this film is a monster hit with me regardless of the length, the casting of Jack Black, and obnoxious film score.ractions with Ann Darrow were my favorite scenes, especially in the last half hour of the film.  <br /> <br />\\"King Kong\\" definitely could have been shorter.

The presentation and layout is sublime. It's user-friendly, uncluttered, and logical.<br /><br />2) Get the CD-ROM Version! It contains British and American pronunciations of every headword, plus lots of other goodies including the Oxford Learner's Wordfinder Dictionary and the Guide to British and American Culture.<br /><br />PS. Some reviewers mention problems with CD-ROM. Patches have been released at the OALD website that may solve these issues. I had some problems that went away after the patches. Also, the tech support from the CD-ROM department is excellent.<br /><br />Read my longer review &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">here&lt;/a>.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Some of the songs are allright and i agree with their political views in american idiot (even though im only 14) but when k104 (local pop, hip hop, rap all that crap teenage girls listen to) starts playing boulevard of broken dreams regulalry you now theres something wrong with this album, all the kids in my school say how much they love green day, but either the only songs theyve ever heard are american idiot, boulevard of broken dreams, and holiday cause thats what they see on mtv, or like my friend jake, when i tried to convince him acdc and led zeppelin and green day were good bands in the 4th grade he said no smash mouth is ten x better (he's nuts) and once he heard boulevard of broken dreams on the radio and started listening to green day he says he's liked green day all his life along with jimmy hendrix anda whole bunvh of other good music, but little kids, if you want some good green day listen to dookie it's my favorite album by them
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I have been a fan of A7X for only 4 days now and they instantly became one of my favorite bands. This album is truly a masterpeice. Every song on here is frickin awsome. My least fave is Clairvoyant Disease, and my fave is Eternal Rest. I listen to this cd constantly, and it never gets boring. A7X RULES!!!!
B0000004V2|5.0|Despite the many well-deserved glowing reviews, it's hard to praise this album enough.  Suffice it to say that calling it one of the greatest debut albums does it a disservice, because I would put it right up there with the best of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and The Who -- that's how good I think it is.    The first song, \\"I Want to be Adored,\\" puts the listener on notice that the Stone Roses are a special band.  From that curious industrial sound prior to the music kicking in, to that spooky bass-line and guitar phrase, to those sparse and memorable lyrics, (\\"I don't need to sell my soul, he's already in me -- I want to be adored\\") it's just a great song, though, in its darkness, departs from most of the rest of the album.  With the more typical and exhilarating \\"She Bangs the Drums,\\" one really gets a sense of the unique guitar stylings of John Squire, and the often-imitated smooth voice of Ian Brown (compare the drum intro to Springsteen's \\"In Candy's Room\\").  \\"Elephant Stone\\" shows off the subtle intrumentation of Mani and Remi, both masters at their craft, on the bass and drums repectively.  One also learns how Squire can easily switch from a leading role to a more communal one.  In \\"Waterfall,\\" Squire's repetitive phrases perfectly compliment the harmony driven vocals of Ian Brown with himself, and with Reni in the background.  It's easily one of the band's best songs.    Following \\"Waterfall\\" there is, to me, a bit of a lull in the album.  Not that I don't like the next three songs, it's just that they don't quite match the quality of the rest.  Still, \\"Don't Stop\\" is a curiosity, where a part of the preceding \\"Waterfall\\" is played backwards.  \\"Bye Bye Badman\\" highlights the distinct stylings of Mani and Reni, who might be as good a rhythm section as Clayton/Mullin of U2.  For those who think that the melody of \\"Elizabeth My Dear,\\" is stolen from Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" please go back and check your sources.  In fact, both songs use a melody credited as \\"traditional\\" (same as Traffic's \\"John Barleycorn,\\" or the Grateful Dead's \\"Going Down the Road\\").    The greatness of the album starts anew with \\"Sugar Spun Sister,\\" which to me sounds slightly like the theme to the movie \\"Chariots of Fire\\" by Vangelis.  The chorus (\\"until the sky turns green and the grass turns several shades of blue\\") consists of one of the most dramatic up-lifting parts of the album.  Just as good, and almost its companion song, is \\"Made of Stone,\\" probably the most \\"hit\\" oriented track.  Next, with \\"Shoot You Down,\\" the subtle Mani/Reni rhythm section shines through.      If the album had ended with \\"Shoot You Down,\\" as they say during a Passover Seder, it would have been sufficient.  But the Stone Roses saved the best for last.  The power of Squire's guitar in \\"This Is the One,\\" after a mellow introduction, is incredible.  But he's just getting started.  Any 8 minute song called \\"I am the Resurrection,\\" better be good.  In fact it's nothing short of fantastic, with Squire pulling out all of his tricks.  Brown's vocals stand out, as do some of the lyrics (i.e. \\"Your tongue is far too long/I don't like the way it sucks and slurps upon my every word.\\").  The Squire/Mani/Reni jam that makes up the second half of this song might be my very favorite part of the album.  \\"Fool's Gold\\" is pure funk, and it turns out the band excels with this type of music as well.    I don't know how a new band could have the talent and inspiration to do an album like this right out of the shoot (some of their earlier singles were quite good, but not at this level). Soon after the band released this album, there were British clubs that played only Stone Roses music.  In the 90's, a British poll of greatest albums rated this album second only to \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  This album (together with My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\") inspired so many subsequent bands and albums that one could write a book about just that.  The Stone Roses debut albums remains, after over 15 years, one of the ten albums I would bring to a desert island, and I guess that's the best way to sum up this, admittedly, overlengthy review.    Footnote:  These are the ten rock albums I would bring to that proverbial desert island (in no particular order):    1. Stone Roses  2. Who's Next - The Who  3. Born to Run - Springsteen  4. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway - Genesis  5. In the Court of the Crimson King - King Crimson  6. Disintegration - The Cure  7. To Our Children's Children's Children - Moody Blues  8. Beggar's Banquet - The Rolling Stones  9. Loveless - My Bloody Valentine  10.Joshua Tree - U2    If I could sneak on three more:    1. Nowhere - Ride  2. Ferment - Catherine Wheel  3. O.K. Computer - Radiohead.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this is the best album ever released no matter what the people that gave it 1 star say i think its wicked and so does everyone else i know!!
0385510454|3.0|I truly enjoyed a lot of this book. Although I know much of the descriptive portions of the book about the cities, villages, etc were not exactly true, was <br />good reading. I could imagine myself sitting in one of the funny little bistros <br />eating Pizza and drinking wine. <br />HOWEVER, when I got to the end of the story I truly thought some of the pages <br />were missing. I am still trying to determine how the book ends......what happened to Marco or whatever his name was. Needs a bit of work on completion of the story. <br />Otherwise a good read.
1400031087|1.0|I DID NOT WRITE THE FOLLOWING REVIEW, BUT WHEN I JUST SAW THAT THIS BOOK IS STILL THE TOP SELLER ON HERE, I WENT AND COPIED IT.  IT'S A LITTLE LONG, BUT WELL WORTH THE READ, BECAUSE THIS BOOK IS THAT BAD.---------------------------------------------- <br />Description of treatment is fiction not fact., November 17, 2005 <br />Reviewer: RJJ (Michigan) - See all my reviews  <br />I have worked with alcoholics and addicts for many, many years, and I worked for the Hazelden Foundation, the treatment program the author indicates he attended. His description of the events in treatment never could have happened. All treatment centers are strictly regulated by a licensing board called the Joint Commission as well by state laws. What James Frey describes is in gross violation of these strict standards of accreditation. The treatment center would have been severely disciplined or shut down. Hazelden is one of the finest treatment centers in the world and is the pioneer of treatment as we know it today. Their treatment program is centered on respecting the dignity of each patient and preserving the safety of all who are admitted.  <br /> <br />James Frey would not have been admitted into treatment in such terrible medical condition without first being sent to a hospital for care and then admitted only after the hospital staff granted medical clearance. He wouldn't have been given stitches in his face at the treatment center, because treatment centers aren't licensed to give that level of medical care. Yes, recovering people can use anesthetic. Anesthetic is not an addictive drug, so no one needs to endure painful dental work or stitches or surgery without masking the pain. Pain medications (which are addictive) are used when necessary, such as after major surgery.  <br /> <br />There are no men in white coats with syringes tackling people who misbehave. People in treatment don't behave in ways the author describes. People are mostly kind, caring and thoughtful. Disagreements are generally mild in nature, and mood-swings are usually the worst we must contend with. When someone behaves in an unacceptable manner, they are asked to change their behavior or be discharged. Treatment romances are never tolerated because they are a precursor to relapse and disrupt the entire unit. Physical violence always results in discharge, as does destruction of property. A patient would be asked to leave immediately if he destroyed a room full of furniture, for example. (Accomplishing this feat, by the way, would be extremely difficult because the furniture is made of heavy wood, built for endurance.)  <br /> <br />The author's assertion that a doctor left the ER without treating him and then drove him to an airport is equally astonishing. Putting a patient on an airplane, where he cannot access emergency medical care while suffering from severe head injuries is unthinkable. That the airlines allowed James Frey on the plane is impossible to believe. These things simply aren't allowed to happen for very obvious and good reasons.  <br /> <br />It goes without saying that counselors don't drive patients to crack houses-or anywhere else-while they are in treatment. Doing so would result in immediate dismissal. Never have I heard people screaming in detox, nor would someone be left lying on a floor overnight. Patients are well monitored and vitals are checked on a regular basis to be certain that blood pressure isn't dangerously high due to the body coming off alcohol and/or drugs. Without close monitoring, we would risk strokes or heart attacks. It is also surprising that almost everyone the author went through treatment with has died or disappeared in rather unorthodox ways. I've never know of this to happen and none of my colleagues, whom I've asked, have ever heard of this either. We sometimes hear that one individual out of a treatment group dies, but even that is fairly rare. People do relapse after treatment, but that happens primarily because people don't follow their aftercare plan.  <br /> <br />I hope if you read this book, you will keep in mind that this description of treatment is fiction. No one who is thinking of going into treatment to seek help should be afraid, thinking they will experience things similar to what the author has described. All reputable treatment centers offer caring support, preserve patients' dignity and will not allow one person's behavior jeopardize the wellbeing of all others. As for the author's assertion that he has stayed sober without the help of AA or other 12 step groups, that may be true, but only about 2% of addicted people find this method successful. And of that 2%, most continue to behave in much the same way they did when they were drinking or using drugs, only without the alcohol or drugs in their systems. Sometimes they are so unhappy and angry being \\"dry\\" because, without a recovery program, they haven't learned to find contentment in sobriety, and their behavior becomes more intolerable than before. The main purpose of AA isn't just to quit drinking or taking drugs, but to become a better person in recovery. <br /> <br />
B0006L5RT2|5.0|Well Done James!! <br />This is not a rock or Hip Hop album.. if that is what you want.. try some where else.. <br />This is a return to Dylan or Cat Stevens perhaps James Taylor? <br />It can be a bit \\"sameish\\" sounding by the time you get to the end of the  album, but then so many albulms can be.  <br />I really enjoy all the songs, 10 tracks in total.  <br />This is a dedicated and earnest musician, definitly has his own sound, you can't mix him up with anyone else (not that Ive heard anyway).  <br />This is a quality album, the more I play it the better it gets! Great poetry and story telling, high with emotion, well arranged musically, esentially with a guitar, keyboard and voice(s).. simple yet very effective.  <br />The tracks \\"Your Beautiful\\" and \\"Goodbye my Lover\\" are already \\"hits\\" with more hits to come of this album I am sure! <br />Listen (really listen!) and enjoy  :)
B000B8QEYC|4.0|It's been a long time since Enya released a new album...let me say 5 years.  Amarantine gives a new touch to the style of Enya.  This album, for most people, will take time to get used to.  When I first heard the songs in the album, I wasn't surprised...rather disappointed because it was different than what Enya used to do.  I have to say, this album is one of Enya's best work.    My favorite songs are Less than a Pearl, Amarantine, It's in the Rain, Long Long Journey, Somebody Said Goodbye, and Amid the Falling Snow.  The lyrics to these songs are good, especially in 'It's in the Rain' and 'Long Long Journey'.  I like how 'The River Sings' has this fast pace chant and is similar to in beat of 'Ebudae'.  Finally, in most of Enya's albums, there is at least one song that has no singing and only instruments - 'Drifting'.    Many people bash at this album because they don't like the new style, but in my opinion, it is new and unique.  Some of these songs can stay in your head for hours after listening to it and you remember it.  I tend to want to listen to them over and over again.  Therefore, the more you listen to this album, the more you will like it.  Give it a try.
B000022TSY|4.0|This review is for the 1999 (40th Anniversary Edition) Columbia DVD. <br /> <br />The movie in a nutshell involves two hippies, Wyatt (Peter Fonda) also known as \\"Captain America\\" and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who score a huge cocaine deal in Mexico and unload it on a rich guy (Phil Spector) in California.  The two then decide to travel by motorcycle to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans to have a great time.  This sets up the rest of the film for many offbeat and bizarre encounters on this free-spirited road trip. <br /> <br />I was only ten years old when 'Easy Rider' came out, and without even seeing it, I can recall how popular the movie was.  In fact, it was very common to see a large black & white poster of Peter Fonda on his chrome chopper, with the helmet and gas tank colorized in florescent red, white and blue.  For the counterculture/anti-establishment crowd, it would seem that traveling cross country on a Harley with a stash of money, drugs along with easy sexual encounters was the new American dream.  It wasn't until recently I had the chance to watch this film in its entirety on DVD, and the sense of free-spirited travel across scenic landscapes holds up well and so does a lot of the music, especially songs like \\"Born to be Wild\\" and several of the songs by the Byrds.  In addition, the movie has some great moments including just about every scene that features Jack Nicholson.  But sadly, communal living, acid trips, getting high on pot, having unprotected sex with prostitutes and dealing drugs for money just dates this film miserably.  All of this wouldn't be necessarily bad especially if it was a bust-your-gut comedy, but unfortunately the film idealizes this lifestyle and plays too heavy-handed against their stereotypical Southern oppressors - especially in the final scene.  Overall, I did like this movie for the cinemetography, music and nostalgia, but wasn't at all sold on the manipulative and outdated message.  However, it's definitely one of these movieslike Woodstock, that brings insight, be it good or bad, into the hippie counter-culter of the late 1960's. <br /> <br />The DVD picture quality is great.  I can only recall seeing roughly four or five tiny specs of film deterioration during the entire film.  The colors and sharpness are fantastic and the stereo sound is excellent too.  The making of the movie bonus feature is very insightful as a lot of details about the motorcycles, the production and background of the film are brought to light.  Dennis Hopper also gives audio commentary for the main feature. <br /> <br /> <br />Movie: B <br /> <br />DVD Quality: A
B0000524CY|5.0|Only a few deleted scenes have been added to this classic movie, but they truly improve upon the original!<br /><br />the \\"spider-walk\\" will give you goose-bumps.<br /><br />The added dialogue scenes are also essential. Reagan's doctor appointment depicts her initial change as subtle... from a sweet girl to a foul mouthed brat. Father Merrin gives his opinion and how... or why... God allows such horrors as demon possession. And the new conclusion featuring Father Dyer and Kinderman is more comforting than the \\"lone man looking down the stairs\\" ending.<br /><br />The version you've never seen captures the spirit of Blatty's novel, and seems less ambiguous than Freidkin's original. When one watches the original, one can't help but get the impression that Freidkin celebrates the triumph of evil over good. The subtle changes in this film let us realize that evil can occasionally win the battle, but will never win the war.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B00005JNJT|4.0|I would recommend Batman Begins because it has a lot of action and  <br />because it had good movie flow. <br /> My experience with the film was good. I would watch it again because it was packed with action and exciting things happening all the time during the movie. I would also watch it again because the way that they went from scene to scene. It had good transitions between scenes.  <br /> There was a lot of action in this movie. Some good examples of this was when the person that killed Bruce's parents was coming out of the court house after being convicted of murder.  Bruce shows up at the courthouse to kill this person, but somebody else shot and killed him instead. Or when they are on the train and it is going to crash because the tracks have been blown out ahead. Batman puts his last touch on the bad guy and exits the ripped in half train through the big opening in the back using his cape. One other scene that was funny and full of action was when Bruce was trying to get the medicine to his girl friend. He was speeding through the highway and on the rooftops is his car that looked like a tank, but could go really fast and could jump great distances. <br />
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Never has three hours gone so fast. Peter Jackson's wit - absent without official leave for the Lord of the Rings trilogy - is back, and this time he has a leading man who can act. That this  leading man is a computer generated ape doesn't reflect poorly on Elijah Wood so much as it reflects inestimable glory on the genius of the folk at Weta Digital - having watched brontosauruses tumbling hilariously over each other, and T-Rexes snapping greedily at Ann Darrow from a cat's cradle of tangled vines, it is clear that DreamWorks, Pixar and Industrial Light and Magic all have some catching up to do. The effects-laden jungle sequence is long (as it is in the original), but it is directed with such panache, and is so funny, that only a curmudgeon or a cineaste would think to complain - and cineastes have no place in a theatre showing King Kong anyway.<br /><br />If I had constructive criticism for the DVD edition it would be to chop rather than augment this time - the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" sub-plot (which eventually fizzles) and a couple of the minor crew characters could be dropped without significant loss, and I thought Driscoll arriving on the top of the Empire State Building and getting the girl disrupted the emotional tie that Jackson had carefully constructed between Kong and Darrow. Driscoll needed to realise he would always be second fiddle, and comport himself to a monastery.<br /><br />But this is minor stuff. A truly outstanding cinema experience.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B00005JO1Y|4.0|This movie was well worth the 3 hours which passed by quickly. I usually wouldn't even bother to view flicks like that, but based on the reviews and previews/trailer this film looked interesting and it fully delivered on the promise. The CGI effects are well applied and it's just phantastic how they produced such an authentic motion picture. There are dinosaurs in there on Skull Island, monster spiders, giant cockroaches, and every other creature you can imagine from a pre-historic world or from a nightmare. <br />Jack Black also delivers as an actor and does an excellent job. The moods are captured well and all the details seem to have been a lot of work and you can tell that craftsmen were at work here. This is a classic motion picture so to speak, or it will become one, and it's a cinematic experience so rare these days. Take the popcorn out and the nachos with cheese and you've got to see it on the big screen and also the DVD, whenever it will be released, will become part of the collection.
0446577383|5.0|The goes with me everywhere I go.  Can't put it down.  Quite an intreging tale about Homeland Security, the Secret Service, the FBI, and the private citizen searching for the truth.  David spin a wonderful multifacetted, non-stop tale, wtih surprises and insights around every corner.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, he hits you with another surprise.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable.  Going in I erased any thought of judging it to the Original Masterpiece.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp made this movie their own.  They didn't try to imitate the original.  The Oompa Loompas in this version while not singing the same songs was, I believe, 10 times more humorous and enjoyable. And including the Backstory of Willy Wonka added a more human touch (albeit weird) than the original.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I write this review in order to encourage people to buy this as a gift for families with children or for their own family or kids. I remember all the songs I was exposed to over and over from when I was little, don't you? From Anine, and Grease, and Sound of Music, and Fiddeler on the Roof.<br /><br />This is such a positive, fun, heart-warming movie with such great and simple songs for any kid to learn and sing. I think it is a must to counter-balance the world of video games, and violent and mindless T.V. to expose your kids, other's kids to something positive like this, AND, importantly, something they will enjoy!<br /><br />What a wonderful present.<br /><br />Here are some of the things this DVD will hold for you:<br /><br />The movie, of course<br /><br />Wonderful surrond sound, and sing alongs to the songs!<br /><br />Commentary by the actors and directors for those of you who want to get into the movie even more deeply...maybe because the wondeful memories you have of it!<br /><br />Still photos of behind-the-scenes and some screen tests and other storyboard stuff, which makes learning about the production of the movie great.<br /><br />Also, some previews too, which is a great walk through history.<br /><br />All and all, give a wonderful postive gife to any family, this is a great one!<br /><br />Lastly, I am in a review writing competition with some other people, so if you liked this review I would love your Yes vote, I write this review though with sincerity and hope for that the kids in the world will find the positive joy of musicals, before they run into the negative elements waiting to take their minds and money later. Take care and best wishes!
B00000ILGX|1.0|Gee,the CD seemed fine. My favorites are here. \\"Everything She Wants\\" (original),\\"Freedom\\",\\"Young Guns (Go For It)\\",\\"Where Did Your Heart Go?\\",\\"Careless Whisper\\"...hey,wait a second...\\"Careless Whisper\\" ain't on here. The ultimate George Michael/Wham! ballad and this is supposed to be a greatest hits album and that song missed? \\"A Different Corner\\" also? Because of stupid remixes of \\"I'm Your Man\\" & \\"Everything She Wants\\"?  Huh,I rather listen to ANDREW RIDGELEY's solo album than those remixes. Really! Psyche!

0399226907|5.0|I grew up with this book, and now my kids are enjoying it.  It is a fun story that teaches them colors, numbers, textures in art, as well as the science of caterpillars- perfect for a lesson plan about butterflies and moths, this book is wonderful! My kids especially like 'eating' the fruits and candy on various pages, and laugh everytime they see the 'big fat caterpillar' this is a timeless classic that will continue to be read for many decades to come.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|First off, I'd like to address the claim that Avenged Sevenfold \\"sold out,\\" since it seems to be on the minds of everybody who reviewed it negatively. I own \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet,\\" as well as \\"Waking the Fallen,\\" so I think I'm in the right area to address this claim.<br /><br />The basic arguement is that it's selling out because M. Shadows doesn't scream anymore, preferring melodic singing over the hardcore screams of the previous albums. He literally can't scream like that anymore due to his throat surgery, so it's hardly selling out.<br /><br />Obviously, next they would say that A7X should have replaced him. Sure, they could have done this, but instead they decided to be loyal to their close life long friend and keep him in the band. Loyalty is not selling out in this situation.<br /><br />The band has progressed from a Hardcore band, to a Metalcore band, and now to just a pure Metal band over the course of three albums. Changing your style isn't necessarily selling out. It's hardly selling out if you decide to go from Hardcore to Metal. If you're Sugar Ray and went from Hardcore to Top 40 Pop, however, it is selling out.<br /><br />Getting past the fact that their names are laughable, their lyrics are corny (as are all Metal), and that M. Shadows' voice has changed... on with the review.<br /><br />M. Shadows' voice is unique. While at first it may sound bad, and you may not want to go on, listen. It's melodic, and it sounds good. The greatest vocalists in Rock and Metal music have had unique voices. You can tell he draws a lot of influence from not only Axl Rose, but from Mike Patton of Faith No More fame as well. His voice is unique, and that's what I like about it.<br /><br />The rest of A7X are amazing as well. Synyster Gates is a simply phenominal Metal guitarist, as well as Zacky Vengence. I think this is best exemplified in \\"Sidewinder\\" (in my personal opinion, the strongest track on the album). Interesting note is that Synyster Gate's father did the left Spanish guitar in the outro.<br /><br />The drums are strong, and the bass... gets overpowered. But that's all Rock music, so that's not really a knock.<br /><br />As I stated before, \\"Sidewinder\\" is probably the best track on the album. In the end they have a short, latin Spanish guitar section. This may also be attributed to \\"selling out,\\" but I'd have to disagree. It's more of expressing their influences, as M. Shadows has said himself, that \\"Use Your Illusions I & II\\" (Guns n' Roses) are his favorite albums of all time. It seems to me like they're trying to flex their creative muscles.<br /><br />\\"The Beast and the Harlot\\" is another strong track. A great opener for the album. One of my favorites, even though other people tend to look over it, is \\"Trashed and Scattered,\\" probably due to it's pace and high Maiden-esque guitars.<br /><br />The whole album is hit after hit, if you ask me. I literally have a hard time removing it from my stereo, it's that good. It's catchy, melodic Metal in the vain Iron Maiden, and it's damn good. I guess if you want to say leaving the three chord Punk Rock realm and actually playing something that takes talent is selling out, then yes, A7X sold out.<br /><br />Awesome album, I'd highly recommend it to any fan of True Metal.te's father did the left Spanish guitar in the outro.  <br /> <br />The drums are strong, and the bass... gets overpowered.

B00005JO1Y|2.0|i don't understand why this movie is getting such spectacular reviews. The movie has few good points and unfortunately three times as many bad points. <br /> <br />The GOOD <br /> <br />The CG King Kong & various creatures  <br />- most were very realistic, but not all of them but not all the time. Ocasionally there were times when they were not believable. <br /> <br />The look of the film <br />- Recreation of NY was spectacular <br /> <br />The BAD <br />- Movie is 90 minutes to long. What took a minute in original movie takes 10 minutes here. The extra minutes did nothing to enhance story/plot lines or develope the characters. <br /> <br />The acting - Uniformally terrible, especially Black. When the best performance in a film is by a special effect (Kong) you have serious problems. <br /> <br />Story/Plot lines - How a group of people being chased in a 3 foot revine by a dozen dinosaurs and not getting trampled to death is not believable or Anne being shaken and stirred about 1000 times when Kong is running and holding her , well loic doe's not rule here. <br /> <br />This movie is a MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT. You would be better off buying the new 2 DVD release of the original. The second DVD of extras is worth it. The ironic thing is the inclusion of the recreation of The Pit Sceen by Jackson which is infinity better than this new version of KING KONG. <br /> <br />Sorry to bring you down. <br /> <br />
B00005NGAK|5.0|If there is only one Irish dance show to watch, this is it.  Mark my words, there will never be an Irish dance show to top this one.  For those unfamiliar, the Feet of Flames dvd is a recording of Michael Flatley's final performace as the \\"Lord of the Dance.\\"  This production is basically Lord of the Dance with a few new bells and whistles as well as an occasional surpise compared to its predecessor.<br /><br />There are several Irish dance shows out there now but few can even be in the same room as Feet of Flames.  Combining Lord of the Dance troupes 1 and 2, this performance is incredibly large.  It also features the first official video recording of Flatley on the flute.  One of his finale numbers, also called \\"Feet of Flames,\\" shows the world the incredible foot speed and talent of its headliner.<br /><br />Lastly, it was unique to see how the lead performers had \\"grown\\" from the few years of touring compared to their unsure and stoic expressions off the Lord of the Dance video.  If any of the show's performers were in a shell of sorts before this video was made, they certainly found their way out from under it for Feet of Flames, (not to be confused with Flatley's Feet of Flames tour).
B000BB1MHS|4.0|Poor boy Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is one of five children who win a tour of the incredible chocolate factory run by Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), a famous recluse.  Inside, they find a wonderland made of candy, presided over by the bizarre, soft-spoken Wonka, a figure who can barely hide his distaste of children.  One by one, they fall victim to their own character flaws, until only Charlie is left to claim the bonus prize... <br /> <br />This movie has a great, colorful look.  The Oompa Loompas nearly steal the show; dead-pan actor Deep Roy is digitally multiplied to play all of the little workers, and their production numbers whenever another child bites the dust are one of the film's chief pleasures.  Some have criticized Depp for channeling Michael Jackson in his performance, but I felt he behaved just as one might after being isolated in a chocolate factory with Oompa Loompas for ten years.

B00005NB8K|3.0|This overlong biopic of Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) is most interesting early on as it details the rise to fame of the Doors.  Soon, however, Morrison surrenders himself completely to drugs and the film spirals into a long series of repetitive scenes in which Morrison abuses himself and others.  The main reason to watch this film is Kilmer's incredible performance.  To impersonate a man whose look and sound are so well-known without descending into characature is a true acting achievement.  Unfortnately, writer-director Oliver Stone dotes on Morrison's sophomoric paens to death and self-centered spiritual explorations so minutely that he often comes across as an unquestioning syncophant.  The greatest narrative achievement of the film is showing how such a self-destructive person can maintain a career--at least for a while--through the efforts of those around him who feel that the talent he offers justifies the garbage they have to put up with.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|Peter Jackson is certainly on a roll.  I was tempted to remove half a star for the film's excessive length, but, as Roger Ebert wrote in his review, it's really complaining about too much of a good thing.  I was never bored and, when thinking about which sequence could have been cut, I realize that I don't want any of them to go away.  (In fact, I'm hoping that there will be even more on an extended edition for DVD in the future.)   <br /> <br />This film looks great.  New York is a stylistic marvel, a montage of popular Depression-era impressions with its vintage cars, clothes, and art deco architecture, not to mention the bread lines, elevated trains, and streets bustling with desperate people.  Skull Island is a steaming hell on earth with death lurking around every corner.  And Kong is a brilliantly realized CGI creation, even more emotive and realistic than Gollum of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" who was also \\"performed\\" by Andy Serkis. <br /> <br />The action is thrilling.  The character development is deft and efficient.  Jackson and his production team are at the top of their game.  The cast (most notably Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black) is terrific.  Enjoy!

0895260131|5.0|Robert Spenser provides an outstanding analysis of the history, theology, and current state of Islam, the religion of more than one billion people. Read this book. Then think.<br /><br />It is little use to provide even sound information unless the information is then put to use. President George Bush said, \\"You're either with the terrorists or you're with us.\\" Spenser raises the point that we cannot begin to win a war on terror until we set goals and adopt strategies which will strike directly at the true root of Islamist terror. Bush advocates that we free Muslims of their own religious law by establishing secular democracies where Islamist regimes now hold power. Spencer advocates that we cut the lifeline for modern terrorists - in part, by destroying the West's reliance on Muslim oil reserves, a new Manhattan project to find alternatives to oil. Either strategy might work.<br /><br />Spencer's book will make you think, and help you think, about the problem of living in peace with Islam. A third strategy, which Spencer does not raise, is a graduated roll back of Islam's base - their lands. Al Qaeda is usually translated as \\"foundation\\" or \\"base\\". I believe, after reading Spencer, that it could also be translated as \\"the Land\\". Islamist terrorists are themselves subject to terror over the loss of territories now controlled by Islamists (a root cause of their attitude toward Israel). Ethnically cleanse any parcel of land, say, the Gaza strip, by forcibly removing all Muslims there to a neighboring country like Syria, and Muslims world wide will experience a religious epiphany. Adopt a step by step plan to answer Islamist terrorism with loss of Islamist territory to non Muslim populations, and Islamist terror should disappear the moment Islamists believe our determination to follow this policy is real.

B000AP04EW|2.0|I'm a fan of beautiful Angelina Jolie. The face is still there and the lower legs, altho skinny. The rest is matronly and tightly corsetted. The plot is dated and clumsy, the action also. Much is made of the use of computers, but it is obvious that they are add-ons - not really integrated into the story.   The magnificent DVD \\"So Close\\" exemplifies modern high tech action in which computers are fully integrated into the story. Shu Qi is the perfect high tech heroine: lovely and lithe, great both in acting and action.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|This album is truly amazing :). It may take a few listens to fully udnerstand it, and get into it, but overall, it is a truly amazing album and will see alot of success :). Songs like `How do you do`, `timor, & `animal city` are true standouts with meanings.
0553804367|4.0|This is a very good book.  It is important because it explains to us laypeople what the specialists in theoretical physics now understand about the universe: how it operates, where it began, how it works, and how time enters into the equation.  It also lets us know that no one currently completely understands our universe, and some of what remains to be learned.<br /><br />I attended a presentation by Dr. Stephen Hawking of the content of \\"A Briefer History of Time\\", (through video hookup instead of in person due to medical problems of the author) recently before receiving and reading the book itself.<br /><br />Having a little knowledge of theoretical physics, the book was an easy read for me.  I was impressed with the way the authors used simple, everyday examples to illustrate the basic and foundation concepts such as Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, and how the theories regarding time, space, and the shape of the fabric of the universe interact to provide insight into the reality of the universe in which we reside.<br /><br />Some have complained about the minimal discussion in this book of current topics such as string theory and M theory, but these are still being studied and developed -- I'm sure Dr. Hawking understands all of the current theories but is not yet willing to commit his extraordinary credibility to any specific theory among those available at this time.<br /><br />I believe that anyone who has ever even slightly wondered how the stars got there or how our universe was formed should read this book.  It is worth the effort to think about the simple examples presented until you understand the concepts being illustrated (especially in the relativity sections).<br /><br />Although I have the original \\"A Brief History of Time\\", I have not read it all the way through, choosing other books instead, such as a somewhat more technical but extremely well-written and edited book by Brian Greene, \\"The Elegant Universe\\", (a finalist for aPulitzer Prize for non-fiction), or a perhaps more readable but slightly out of date (1994) book, \\"Hyperspace\\", by Michio Kaku.  I have read and highly recommend both of these for the more technically inclined readers.
B000BKJ78K|5.0|You people dont seem to realize that perhaps the intended audience for this release are people who did NOT buy the released trilogy last year (i.e. cost too much; didn't get around to it; only have fullscreen version and want widescreen or vice versa, etc.) and would now like to purchase a classic film trilogy for this year's holiday season at a comparatively low price ($70 last year- $40 now).   <br /> <br />Say what you will about original versions vs. special editions but none of that has any bearing on this release, which, speaking as someone who did not get the trilogy last year, I appreciate being able to get at a discounted price tag. <br /> <br />As the box states, this release is a discounted FAMILY offer, which in lamen terms means people who care little about impossible to please, uber-fanboys and their completely irrelevant bonus discs.  If you already have and are satisfied with last year's versions, great. Good for you. Don't buy this because it is not intended for you anyways. Duh.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Going into King Kong, I had my doubts.  I was really looking forward to it, and I had high expectations that I was afraid wouldn't be met.  Well, they were met and, in a sense, surpased.  King Kong is a fantastic film.  Everything kong fans would want, and everything Peter Jackson fans would want. <br /> <br />The only downside is the beggining.  It is way too long before kong shows up.  In fact, it's about an hour.  However, this does provide the watcher with great characters and great suspenseful anticipation.  So once the mighty gorrila does appear, it's all the cooler. <br /> <br />And once he does show up, the action never stops.  The movie has a relentless pace.  ACtion scene after action scene action scene.  The great thing about Peter Jackson is his willingness to go all out when it comes to action with special effects.  He doesn't hold back for integrity or suspense like Speilburg, he creates these insanely amazing sequences that blow me away.  Not only is he willingly to do this, but he he very competent at it.  He's very creative when it comes to big action pieces.  The best one in this film is Kong vs. multiple T-rexes.  It's really amazing. <br /> <br />I've heard many people complain about the \\"stampede\\" scene, that it doesn't look real.  Well, I thought it looked great.  It's a really awesome scene. <br /> <br />Right after Kong is captured on Skull Island, we cut right to New York.  This is a good thing.  Lets not waste any more time on the ship.  Kong's rampage through New York is as cool as any one could ask.  He throws cars around and smashes stuff.  It's just awesome.  There is a somewhat corny scene with Ann on a frozen pond, but it still serves it's purpose well. <br /> <br />The famous climax atop the Empire State Building is a bit drawn out, but it's so visually spectacular that we can forgive it. <br /> <br />The brilliance of Kong, is it's epic nature.  The action is relentless and huge.  The characters are all developed beyond what they should be.  Sure, Jackson is gluttunous in his film making, but that is just so friggin fun to watch.  Go see King Kong.  It is the best movie of the year.
B00005JOGU|5.0|<br />How Philip Seymour Hoffman, who I read somewhere is 6'2\\", thoroughly becomes the elfin Truman Capote is one of the greater acting mysteries of the year, but he does and as a result Capote is a terrific movie in every frame. Beginning with the Clutter family murders in rural Kansas and covering Capote's struggles to write In Cold Blood, the movie also has superb acting by Catherine Keener (last seen bringing sanity to the world of middle-aged male stupidity in 40 Year Old Virgin), the always estimable Chris Columbus, and Clifton Collins as Perry Smith, one of the killers and in this movie, the only one that matters. Five stars too to the director and cinematographer who superbly contrast the bleak winter open space of the Kansas prairie and the confining closeness of the jail scenes with Capote and one of the killers, Perry Smith. As good as he is in capturing Capote physically, Hoffman does even better with his psychological make-up. Charming, manipulative, and -- gradually -- in love with Smith, Capote is torn between wanting to save Smith's life and knowing he needs him dead for his book to have the ending it requires. One of the film's nicer twists is how this user also becomes the used -- meeting his match in Smith.  <br /> <br />There may be better movies than Capote in 2005, but they will surely be few in number, and frankly now, in mid-December, it's only rival to my mind is Brokeback Mountain.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|I'm an old skool korn fan. back in the day i used to jam to shoots and ladders just like everyone else =). i also loved life is peachy. but then follow the leader appeared and was \\"ok\\" but nothing to be compared to their first albums. and ever since then my ears have been fighting a losing battle with korn. <br /> <br />they progressively get worse with every cd. issues was ok, better than follow in my opinion just because fred durst was not on it for a lame duet. duets are SO 96' (jk). this new stinker marks a hallmark in their shameful history. theres a reason korn is famous even a little bit now and its called self titled. without such an awesome first album they would have been washed out years ago. <br /> <br />everyones being all nice to them just out of respect for their old ties to fame and im sick of it. these songs are really lame, mean nothing, are really whiney and have no rhythum thats even remotely different. its all the same beat, broken up a little so your mind doesnt completely want to sleep. <br /> <br />if they just went back and found their old sound again i think the RECORD LOW SALES of take a look in the mirror (worst album in my opinion, even worse than st anger or as we call it st anus). it isnt that rock or metal or even this retarded rap-core are \\"dead and buried\\" as someone said on here. its that every effort people put out is in many ways like a movie video game. they rely on the name to sell the product to make money, reguardless of quality. <br /> <br />stop this from reaching shelves. if you DONT BUY IT then they cant make it anymore. no offence everyone, but lets be realistic. korn is circling the drain if they continue on this path, send them letters, emails or what have you to make sure our kids and so on grow up on awesome music again!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie is a definate must see! I loved the referances to the fallen angels such as Belial (who is equated to Satan), Legion, and the others who if one takes a little time to study or just even look up makes everything fall into place. I love this movie, it makes one think.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin's 4th album is utterly perfect. This album literally can bring you to tears of joy in knowing how true rock and roll was to be played. There is not one song that is bad or even remotely bad.  <br />Some of my favorites include, Misty Mountain Hop, The Battle of Evermore, Stairway to Heaven (of course), and Black Dog.  <br />I may not have been alive during the making of this album but anyone who knows music and has heard it will agree...it's awesome. Jimmy Page's guitar perfectly combined with Robert Plant's vocals that defined rock and roll and new bands are still searching for that kind of connection in their music.  <br />
B000BKVQTS|4.0|The brilliance of Terry Gilliam's work is often misunderstood, misinterpreted, and completely misses the audience, if the viewer does not allow himself or herself to submerge into the story with an open mind.  However, the notion of an open mind has a very vague connotation, which is also the intention of Gilliam.  After examination of Gilliam's previous work it is evident that his visual manifestations have a bizarre and even unearthly tone to them.  It is with innovating imagination that Gilliam applies his artistry to the silver screen, as his creations are often fantastic in nature with a strong touch of cognitive dissonance.  Within the conflicting concepts, Gilliam allows the viewer to cerebrally struggle with one or multiple ideas, which presents some of his ingenious cinematic dexterity.  On occasion, his visions can feel a little tangled, and leave the viewer slightly disoriented.<br /><br />In many aspects, Gilliam is a pioneering artist that requires artistic freedom when he plunges into his passion.  It also means that when his creation is finished it does not always allow the audience to grasp his intentions, as his thoughts on the screen do not easily transfer to the mind of the audience.  Some of difficulty with Gilliam's films might rest in the audience's inability to surrender themselves to the story.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is one of these stories that might easily vanish among the many Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter's (J.K. Rowling wanted Gilliam to direct her Harry Potter books), and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  These epic fantasy films have serious undertones and strong moral messages while applying fascinating might and magic.  Gilliam uses a different approach, as he always breaks away from the well-traveled road.  In this process, Gilliam attempts to reach an audience that would allow themselves to unlock their tightly secured maturation and let out this inner child.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not as easy as Gilliam anticipated to let out the child within each adult, as many have deem the story self-indulgent and an immature journey of irresponsibility.  Nonetheless, in Gilliam's free adaptation of the Brothers Grimm remains true to the gruesome violence in the Grimm fairy tales.  Thus, those that state that the story is too violent for children should consider the film in its historical context, as parents, grandparents and other relatives scared the bejesus out of their children to foster certain behaviors centuries ago.<br /><br />One of the traditional characteristics in Gilliam's films is humor, dry and witty with occasional slapstick to soften up the audience.  It might be relic from his days with the Monty Python, yet he is also very well aware of the importance of human laughter and its ability to heal people in pain.  Sometimes I get the feeling that Gilliam feels sorry for those who do not laugh, as he always incorporates some element of humor in his cinematic creations.  Thus, the audience should also be aware of the amusing absurdity in the Brothers Grimm, as the film frequently applies much of this healthy cerebral exercise.<br /><br />The story itself in the Brothers Grimm follows the two Grimm brothers Jacob (Heath Ledger) and Wilhelm (Matt Damon), as they make a living exploiting people's superstition.  Eventually, the law catches up with them, as the Italian torture master Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) arrests them by order of the French General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce).  However, a second chance is given to the Grimm's as they are told to put a stop on the mysterious events in the forest of Marbaden. If they succeed, Delatombe will spare their lives.<br /><br />Once Jacob and Wilhelm arrive to the German village of Marbaden with their eager to kill supervisor Cavaldi, they begin to witness the strange events of the small village.  With the help of the local scout and ranger Angelika (Lena Headey) they enter the woods and to their bewilderment they learn that there indeed exists strange and dangerous creatures heard from fairy tales.  Squeezed between two sides - the imaginary and the real - they soon learn that both sides want them dead.  It is an intriguing symbolical struggle, as imagination faces off with rationalization.  The struggle could also offer an analogy to modern times, as wars do not show sympathy to the people caught in between the fighting parts.<br /><br />Besides the fairy tale, the film presents a myriad of concepts both psychological and social in nature.  For example, the individual construction of beliefs, morals, and values emerge within the story through a childhood trauma experienced by both Jacob and Wilhelm concerning magical beans.  Expansionism and power then go under scrutiny through the character Delatombe and the magical creature in the woods.  Together these ideas offer a criticism of the contemporary society, as it is too rigid and not always understanding of the differences within the many parts of the world.  The intolerance often fueled by greed for power is the film eternal beauty.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is brilliant in several ways, but the profiteering machine of the film industry has blocked its genius in the contrasting light of many other films.  Thus, in comparison with other films, which are a natural act, the true gem within the film dissolves into a trite fantasy adventure.  However, if the viewer allows himself or herself to transcend beyond the ordinary into a world of individuality a sparkling fantasy tale that freely adapts the Grimm's fairytale world emerges.  Lastly, Gilliam's intentions are admirable, but to expect most people to free themselves from their previous experience is also a little too much.ir bewilderment they learn that there indeed exists strange and dangerous creatures heard from fairy tales.

B000050XEI|5.0|I'm one of those people that listens to all kinds of music ... but I also love the New Age sounds of ENYA.... this CD is probably one of my most overplayed CDs that I own.. I pretty much listen to it once a day.. either when i'm working alone in the quiet or trying to fall asleep.. there is no way to go wrong with A Day without Rain. <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks: <br />1) Day without Rain- all instrumental. took me a while to like it.. but now i absolutely LOVE it. it's so soothing. <br />2) Wild Child- this is my most-played song <br />3) Only Time- probably the only song I really knew when I first bought the CD. still great. <br />6)Flora's Secret- pretty song :) <br />7) Fallen Embers- this is the song that you want to listen to when you're asleep by the fireplace :) <br />8) Silver Inches- another instrumental. really good <br />10) one by one- another reason to love enya. <br />11) Lazy Days- i find myself humming to this all the time. Great way to end the cd (da da da da da )
6305910340|5.0|Not really a movie about Bobby Fischer, but rather the drive in the chess community to find the next prodigy who will take the Chess world by storm.<br /><br />Bobby Fischer began to play chess at the age of 7.  His meteoric rise to winning the national Championship in his early teens and then going on to defeat the World, is the Highlight of US Chess History.<br /><br />Chess, like Soccer, is much bigger in the rest of the world than it is in the US.  Fischer caused a blip in the radar screen that elevated Chess in the US.  The Chess community has since then been on the look-out for the next prodigy in hopes of repeating the same event.<br /><br />That's really not the main thrust of the movie, however.  It creates the context in which the relationship between Josh and his Father is explored.  In that regard, the movie is superior and excels.<br /><br />Bobby Fischer represents the megelomaniac for whom Chess is everything to the exclusion of family, friends and relationships.  (That's really a pretty accurate picture of Fischer the man, by the way.)  Josh rejects that path and chooses instead to retain his humanity, and tender conscience, despite the forces battling for him and his future.<br /><br />A Father who is tempted to live vicariously through his son's gift is all too common and present in sports and other areas as well.  A coach, who has his own ghosts and demons and recognizes the potential in Josh, who is unable to release him, for fear that he will leave the path of greatness.  Vinnie, the park speed chess player who represents the joy and fun of chess and rails against the establishment who wants to suck the life out of Josh to be their messiah.<br /><br />It's all there.  The chess provides the back-drop to it all.<br /><br />Many who have shied away from this movie imagining it to be a dull movie about Chess will be pleasantly surprised when they see it.<br /><br />Simply an outstanding film and well worth viewing, even if you don't know a bishop from a pawn!t know a bishop from a pawn!
B00006JDU9|2.0|first off, I am a big Star Wars fan, and was quite excited about this movie.  Unfortunately I was disapointed.  Certainly the film is not without merit, there are some great action scenes, and special effects.  The movie is also not without a few good characters.  Unfortunately though the movie is almost 100% eye candy.  The characters could have been much better than they were.  Jar Jar Binks is a commonly used example, and for good reason.  He could have been an enjoyable comic relief character, but instead he was just intolerably irritating.   Then there is the pod race, a scene which got a lot more focus than necessary, which left me feeling like Lucas just wanted to throw in something to take up time.  This could have been a good film with a bit more focus on character developement, and plot, and some better acting (though not all of it was terrible).
B000002VMD|5.0|This album is a monstrous piece of watery cow poo. So why do I give it 5 stars? Because the royalties from it made Nick Lowe, the writer of What's So Funny 'bout Peace Love and Understanding, a millionaire. Granted, the cover of that song on this album is worse than Kevin Costner's acting, but who cares? The fact that Nick Lowe, who might be the wittiest songwriter of the past 25 years, got rich from this crap is a textbook example of irony. Now stop looking at the Bodyguard soundtrack, and go buy some whatever Nick Lowe albums are still in print.

Some of the places aren't traditionally breathtaking, like the lights of a cluster of gas stations and restaurants at night, or a wide city expressway in the rain.  But I see these things, and they remove my breath.  With scenes of mundane events and Bud's utterly bizarre social behavior sprinkled evenly about, the movie seems to get to LA in no time. <br /> <br />Once Bud is LA and he is reunited with Daisy, we get a lot of plot filled in, and Daisy gets a lot of mouth filled in with Bud's penis.  The oral sex is the least erotic thing I've ever seen, but the lens flares and the contrast between the brown clothes and the bright background looks fantastic. <br /> <br />The \\"story\\" in the movie happened before what we see in the movie.  The movie is an epilogue that drops tidbits of information about the story.  The story happened from when Bud and Daisy met as kids until the night, decades later, when Bud last saw Daisy.  There's a whole lot going on in this movie beneath the surface, and the surface itself is pretty badass.
B00012FXB8|2.0|I use to be tolerant against misses and flaws in movies, but this movie goes too far... In a way, i really love this movie. I love the depressing mood in it, i like many actors and music is very good. But the flaws really destroys it! First i watched the original version. It is okey but I could not feature that the Alien coming out of the dog is almost bigger than the dog itself! And in the end, when the alien comes out of her chest, she don't dies and feels almost no pain, just holding the alien with her hands. How can the filmteam be so  clumsy!!!! Then I watched the special edition. I liked it better. The ending was also better skipping the alien coming out of her. that was too studio and cliche i think. But in the special edition i noticed another disturbing thing. In original version, you can see that Newt has drowned in her capsel. But in the Special edition, when they find her, she looks like a smashed mess, with her face totally demolished. But then in the obdocy-scene she looks real clean and in one piece. Have monkeys cutted this film?? This could have been a great movie.
014028009X|3.0|The book is light and funny. I found myself smiling and even laughing out loud in a couple of places. I particularly liked the parallels with Pride and Prejudice and thought the exploits of the narrator's gonzo mother added just the right offbeat touch. I also enjoyed the descriptions of Bridget's terrible dinner parties. <br /> <br />The subtext is rather sobering. The book delivers some distressing messages about 20th century gender relations, materialism, fidelity, and industriousness. It was my awareness of these issues, and the continual mental contrasts I could not help making between Austen's world and Fielding's, that kept me from enjoying the book as much as I might otherwise have.  <br /> <br />It is this lack of sheer escapism that prevents me from placing Helen Fielding among the great comic writers such as Wodehouse, Thurber, S.J. Perelman, Patrick Dennis, and John Kennedy Toole. Nevertheless, I am glad I read it. It was an agreeable way of spending an evening.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Sometimes I think that children shouldn't be allowed to post album reviews here, they are simply too immature to do so intelligently. It is at the very least obvious that they do not possess or have not heard the album. And, there are few children under 25 who even know who Ray Charles is, so I say send 'em back to the playground and let 'em mature for 20 years.<br /><br />The Grammy Awards doesn't or shouldn't reward new music; it rewards GOOD music. The awards are voted on by other Grammy winners. It's not a popularity contest, like the Golden Globes or People's Choice. The Grammys are almost exclusively peer review.<br /><br />So. Why did GLC win 8 Grammys? Because it was nominated for at least that many. Because many of the people who voted for it were at least in part influenced by the man Ray Charles and are at the very least a fan of him and the people who participated in the album.<br /><br />Most of all, because for a dying man's last hurrah, this album was damn good.<br /><br />I can only imagine the honor the guest artists felt to be a part of what would turn out to be a historic recording. Johnny Mathis beamed with pride while his duet, \\"Over The Rainbow\\", was played at Ray Charles' funeral during the viewing of the body. Mathis, Norah Jones, Willie Nelson, James Taylor, Gladys Night, Natalie Cole, BB King, and Sir Elton John all got Grammy Awards because of their participation in this album.<br /><br />Those too young to appreciate this album probably shouldn't buy it. That's as it should be. But those of us mature enough to know a 70 year old can't sing like a teenager, bought it or were gifted it as a tribute to a legend, were rewarded by the fact that the quality is still there despite the frailty, and speaking only for me, I'm honored to have it in my possession.
0786711647|5.0|A Kiss Before Dying combines psychological suspense with precision plotting. Every detail dovetails; there are no superfluous characters, no extraneous filler, each fact carries the story forward, twisting and turning, to its chilling conclusion. This is the sort of book you can reread with pleasure, noting how even the smallest details co-incide. <br /> <br />Levin has a great ear for dialogue. The characters of the three Kingship daughters are clearly differentiated, yet not stereotyped. Even minor characters come alive. Levin has begun his trademark use of day-to-day minutia to counterpoint the growing horror and tension, a technique that he would hone to perfection in Rosemary's Baby.  <br /> <br />I recommend this novel wholeheartedly. It is hard to find a flaw in it. <br />

B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's 1999 debut album, \\"No Angel\\", was one of the most unique introductions for an artist with the most angelic voice and hit-ballad potential. While some artists struggle with sophomore efforts, especially those that are the hyped-up descendents of super-genious, hit packed predecessors, \\"Life for Rent\\" is both seductive and irresistable as a follow up to the tremendously popular and successful \\"No Angel\\". With a dazzling catalogue of eleven enthralling tracks, almost every song could easily qualify for a single-release status - effortlessly trumping any previously occupied chart position, involving not too distant hits of the likes of \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Thank You\\", or \\"Hunter\\". Most worthy of praise, (aside from the radio-friendly super ballad \\"White Flag\\"), are the blissfully enchanting \\"Stoned\\", \\"Who Makes You Feel\\", \\"Sand in my Shoes\\" and \\"Do You Have a Little Time\\". Stirring and moving moments on the album belong to \\"Life for Rent\\", a very reflective and uplifting track, as well as \\"Don't Leave Home\\", another gem that begs of attention. More weaker and distracting moments on \\"Life for Rent\\", though very few and in my opinion - surpassable - include \\"Mary's in India\\" (though I must admit I like the twist at the end of this song's narrative..) and \\"This Land is Mine\\". While occasionally, after three or four listens, the album might seem overwhelmingly balladic, Dido's immense talent as both singer and song writer ultimately inflate \\"Life for Rent\\" with great confidence and musical credibility. This was by no doubt one of the best albums of 2003, and without a shadow of a doubt - one of the very BEST sophomore albums to come from a very respected and treasured still-fresh artist. Indeed \\"Life for Rent\\" trumps its predecessor....with such an achievement one can only wonder what may come next....  <br />Buy and enjoy \\"Life for Rent\\"
B000BMSTMS|3.0|First, of all i enjoy metal. all forms except for a few: Limp Bizkit for example. Anyways, you people tearing apart korn is not going to stop people from buying their albums. Give up already! Secondly, i do like some of the bands mention such as Dream Theatre, Megadeth, Black Sabbath all of mentioned are great legendary bands. For newer stuff you should hear Lamb of God or Mastodon there also great. Thirdly,i do enjoy some numetal(disturbed, korn, mudvayne a few...). I have listened to korn in the past and they were great. I gave up after issues but some embrace some dont on direction of music of a band. Twisted Transistor is a decent song there best since maybe Here to Stay that i have heard. I havent heard the rest of the album like i said im not reviewing the album just the stupid people who tear down people who do not like the same bands as them. All I say is to turn off radio/mtv and listen to your bands and quit making stupid reviews going after every numetal band heck even black sabbath for crying out loud. Black Sabbath are the ones who invented dark heavy riff to mainstream. If it werent for them, you wouldnt listening to your metal. anyways, that is my rant.
B00005JOFO|5.0|E. Annie Proulx visited a cowboy bar in Wyoming and felt an underlying eroticism seething in that most macho of possible places.  That observation translated into a courageous short story in 1997, a study of love between two cowboys whose world would never condone such feelings (remember Laramie?), and so 'Brokeback Mountain' was born in New Yorker Magazine.  Now that tender and heartbreaking tale of hidden, durable, passionate love between two young men trapped in a society that will not allow such feelings has been luminously transformed in to a film: it is rewarding to see how successful that long journey became.<br /><br />The story is so well known that it need not be summarized beyond the brief statement that two nineteen year old young men, both with histories of abandonment, need, and pain, find physical attraction in the cold nights on Brokeback Mountain while guarding sheep, and though both assure each other that neither is gay, the love creeps out of the night physicality into the daytime sunny thrills of feeling alive and cared for. After only a couple of months, their job completed, they part ways, each marrying, having children, but over almost twenty years they periodically reconnect, understanding the depth of their forbidden love, and cope the best they can.  Divorces ensue, promises of being together permanently are thwarted by a number of reasons, and the while the story evaporates into the lonely landscape of Wyoming, the love that bonded them, a love they could never 'own', ends.<br /><br />Ang Lee molds this magnificently poignant love story with grace, style, realism, and bravery.  Proulx's story is made visual by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay and while the script is true to the story on the whole, there is much added business about the wives and children and parents that perhaps is necessary for moviegoers to 'get it', but in this viewer's mind is less sensitive than the extended silences within the vast spaces of Wyoming that made Proulx' story so quietly and powerfully understated.  Heath Ledger is superb as Ennis Del Mar but Jake Gyllenhaal is equally as strong as Jack Twist: together they create a chemistry racked with pain as well as bliss and make their characters totally believable.  Michelle Williams does well as Ennis' long suffering wife Alma, while Anne Hathaway remains Anne Hathaway, a lady far too elegant to be convincing as the cowgirl Lurene the Jack marries in the vacuum without Ennis.<br /><br />But criticisms are few (the only major one is that Gyllenhaal has not been sufficiently recognized for his brilliant portrayal in Heath Ledger's shadow).  This is a beautiful film that addresses love and all its permutations and it is so refreshing to see a story of this depth and significance so quietly and tenderly placed before the theater audience.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05hat made Proulx' story so quietly and powerfully understated.

0385335482|3.0|It's funny how I keep gravitating towards these Shopaholic books when I always feel so exasperated by Rebecca's irresponsibility. She lives in a perpetual state of denial and has lost touch with reality, yet things always seem to work out for her in the end. Not very believable! However, the books are brilliantly written and flow so nicely. The characterizations are very impeccibly drawn and the dialogue is hilarious! As much as I wanted to be impatient towards Rebecca, I couldn't help cheering for her and admiring her for being so creative.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Go Mariah. This Album is truly a good one. I am proud MC and it gives great pleaseure in listening to it as well..not like hearing Madonna screach and squeal.
0553801503|3.0|I'm a fan of the series but this book does not measure up to the others.  Actually, not much happens in this book that advances the story line and I wonder why Martin wrote the book.  With some minor exceptions the characters are boring and could have been omitted.    <br /> <br />However, there are some very good things about the book.  The story of the Iron Island, the Stark girls and the irrepressible Littlefinger make the book readable.  Also, Martin is one heck of a writer.  Any other author would have received 1 star. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to wait for the book to hit paperback.   <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001CCXY8|5.0|Very very brutal .............i love it my first metal album and the dvd really teaches you alot about them makes you get to kno the ppl behind the music i love cc's music and now am a dedicated fan soon ill purchase eaten back to life thier first album
B00005QXXO|4.0|I won't say much, the songs that were previously released are all done very well, and a good selection of songs was chosen.    The good - like spinning plates is AMAZING, you can actually here it, true love waits, wonderful b-side    the bad - FREAKIN SHORT...thats all    get it when you already have all the other radiohead cd's an need something else while you anxiously check [...] to see how the new album is coming along.
B000063DIH|3.0|I like it especially Judas be my guide and fear of the dark which are two of the best tracks i have heard from the band
B000002UJQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM, sometimes its my favorite, sometimes the Bends is. All radiohead is delicious, and i think all should be purchased and listened to in due time. I recently spent the last 3 months tracking down all the rare and b-sides i could, and they are sexy too...now the OKPC (as i call it) <br /> <br />EVERY SONG IS GOOD, this is the last radiohead album you will get that has \\"real hits\\" on it. It also in my mind is the last radiohead album before the music completely changes direction. <br /> <br />This album makes me feel small and tiny, they music feels so big. The lyrics are confusing, and inspiring. Some of the songs are downright creepy (crawling up the walls) <br /> <br />These guys are musical geniuses, and i don't use that term lightly. The paved the way for nearly ever british band that came after them (if they didn;t u2 did even though they werent british) <br /> <br />I could write a book about my love for this album, just buy it, and love it, I am on my second copy of the album because my first is nearly destroyed. <br /> <br />Best Tracks : Paranoid, Exit Music, Karma, Electioneering, Climbing, Lucky, Tourist...
068987474X|5.0|This book is a revelation.  It gives you the real scoop on what guys are thinking and when a woman should wake up and smell the coffee and realize when a guy is just not that into her.  As a successful 27 year old, I found the material matter-of-fact and funny.  I laughed out loud as I saw myself in the pages and even though the truth hurts sometimes, it was so liberating to read a book written from a typical male's point of view.  I have recommended it to all my girlfriends who have spent so many hours trying to figure out what a guy is thinking.  Take the plunge; read this book and realize what an enlightening experience it can be to be able to say to yourself, \\"maybe he's just not that into me\\" and move on to find someone worthwhile.
B00004XONN|5.0|I would rank this right after ok computer and the bends, but very close. THis album is maybe not the easiest to digest the first time through, but is astounding. It in many ways reflects albums of the 60's and 70's which where not about a hit song and some filler, but about an album as an entire statement.  <br /> <br />It has ups and down, loud points, soft points, and closes with a beautiful harp laden tune. <br /> <br />I would recommend for those just starting to listen to radiohead, hold of on this and get the bends and ok computer. by hearing where they came from you will appreaciate this album so much more <br /> <br />Standout tracks: Kid A, how to disappear..., everything..., motion picture..., and idioteque(the beat..is infectious, no matter what some radiohead snobs say) <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|Another perfectly flawless album from the greatest band ever (imho), it will take you places you never imagined going.  Rip a bowl (optional) and listen to the album from beginning to end without skipping anything.  This album is BEAUTIFUL.  Utter genius.
B000002TQV|5.0|This album is perhaps the best, and like the reviewer below me i think many would criticize that. This album has the feel of later radiohead, but the style of early radiohead. They still play straight rock and roll on this album, they later blur the lines of what style of music they are playing (which is a good thing)  <br /> <br />The writing on this album is strong, both musically and lyrically. There is no best song, no worst, they all play their part. This album is very cohesive, each song makes sense in its position. <br /> <br />I would recommend starting with this album, it will introduce you to the band and their quirkiness without being overwhelming, some would rather dive right into anmesiac or kid-a, but for me that wouldn't have done. I like primarily hippie music, and jam-bands, so for me i needed something more rock based. <br /> <br />I won't give a song by song breakdown, but rather say that this album is a masterpeice (so is ok computer)in my mind these two albums are tied for number 1, buy both at the same time if you can, if you can't however i will say go with the bends, and then you can hear to band progress when you buy ok pc
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Yesterday in casual conversation, I called The Manchurian Candidate the best remake I've seen of late. Last night, to my delighted amazement, I watched what will likely go down as one of the greatest remakes of all time. <br /> <br />When you've topped the charts with the most profitable movie trilogy of all time, when you've created a film that wins 11 Oscars, when you've created the single greatest achievement in digital effects to date in one of the most epic fantasy series' in film history: what's your follow up act? <br /> <br />I'd probably make an artsy talking heads film, but director Peter Jackson has dared to raise the bar by remaking one of the most beloved films in history. Anyone who's seen the 1970s remake knows that he's treading dangerous waters, and with all the remakes, revisits, and game adaptations polluting the screens this year, even the largest budget in film history is hardly enough to make this a confident exploit. <br /> <br />But Jackson has the two ingredients needed to make this work: he understands why the original works, and he understands why it doesn't. King Kong of the 1930s, for all its amazement, was pretty disturbing in the way it explored its themes. Kong was an extremely sympathetic creature, but Faye Wray's Ann was shallow and self-absorbed. Here Naomi Watts provides an intelligent character who grows to understand Kong's compassion and beauty. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the $ 64,000 question: Does it surpass the original? <br /> <br />I had the good fortune of catching the 1930s version on TCM yesterday, so I get to compare them with both films fresh in my mind. In my taste, the original is superior. <br /> <br />I say \\"in my taste\\" because it really just comes down to a matter of taste. Both films work equally well on their respective levels. It's all a quetion of what you fancy. I'm a sucker for long takes of a charging stegosaurus, and I liked how Kong was unappreciated in the original. Jackson's version works on manymore levels, but the original works better on its own terms. <br /> <br />The one place where Jackson stepped wrong was with the natives. It was as if they waited around for a lost ship of white people to come around so they could murder its members and go into convulsions. They don't really do much else. Their presence is a nuisance but short lived, leaving time to get to the real story. <br /> <br />This goes beyond what I thought a good remake was capable of. It somehow remains almost entirely true to the original, while still feeling fresh and new. I hope this one gets more tha technica nominations at Oscar-time because I haven't seen a film like this since....well, King Kong.
B000002UR7|3.0|I recently found and bought all the b-sides radiohead released, and put them on a cd, and I think some of the b-sides for this album would have been better picks... <br /> <br />Overall good early 90's kinda grunge/rock album. Definately sounds like radiohead, but they haven't quite matured yet. I love \\"you\\", creep is overrated but I still like it, all in all if you want to get into radiohead don't get this, it does no represent what they are now, get this album when you, like me begin to obsess over their music and want everything they have released. <br /> <br />Final thought: wait on this is you are just getting into radiohead, and start with the bends and/or ok computer
B00005JO1Y|2.0|This is in a nut shell a long, loosely connected, hog-pog of random non-stop action and melodrama; yet there is still much merit to it.  <br />If Peter Jackson proved anything with Lord of the Rings, he proved he could create perfect fantasy worlds.  In this CG master-piece we get to see Dinosaurs in far better quality than Lord of the Rings and ruins in far greater beauty than Indiana Jones.  Even the old world of New York city was captured with a supreme beauty.    <br />That said everything is down hill from there.  The action is so wild and so over played and so ridiculous people were laughing in the theater just because it was so over done. <br />Story Line, I think Peter Jackson's work with Lord of the Rings should speak for itself.  What story there was, was laughable, and so loosely connected it seemed as if it were just a board author rambling to himself.   <br />The movie was entertaining, but that's about it.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This is one of the few radiohead albums that will not receive 5 stars from me. However it has some of my favourite songs on it. The reason it only gets four is because on the whole, then album to me is not as cohesive as in the past. Some of the songs start of great, but then don't really go anywhere (sit down, stand up) <br /> <br />The following songs are amazing: 2+2=5, Sail to the moon, there there, i will, drunk punchup, sctterbrain, and wolf at the door. <br /> <br />which is over half the album <br /> <br />the rest of the songs are also excellent peices of music, the only song perhaps i don't really like is go to sleep. <br /> <br />anyhow excellent CD, but I would warn those who have never listened to radiohead not to start here, start with ok computer, or the bends, much more accesible albums
B00009Z574|2.0|I have owned this album now for over a month, and now I'm giving it a second review.    They weren't number one hits.  But Future Times, Onward, and Silent Wings of Freedom are really great songs.  They alone warrant the purchase for serious Yes fans.  Release, Release is also an excellent recording - with lasting lyrics. The only criticism I'd give to these great songs is that some synthesizer sections went overboard.    Unfortunately, what sticks out the most in this album are 2 songs that were in really questionable taste: Don't Kill the Whale, and Circus of Heaven.    In particular, in \\"Circus\\", Jon Anderson kindly reveals how deeply he believes in tarot cards, and how it makes him feel when he puts his pyramid hat on.  Thanks for sharing, Jon.    \\"the Whale\\" is a silly bleeding heart attempt at bringing attention to the plight of whales.  I get a laugh every time after listening to the corny sincerity of Squire's background vocals.  But I do \\"dig it\\", whales are pretty cool.    \\"Madrigal\\" would be a great song, but Jon keeps drilling this obscure idea of \\"the seventh age\\", and I'm reminded he was wearing his tights and a pyramid hat while recording the vocals.    \\"Arriving UFO\\" is kind of between good and bad.  There is good music in it, but it nonetheless reminds me of Steven Spielberg - an individual whom I personally do not become intrigued by.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is a tough album...it essentially is the b-sides to kid a, they were all recorded at the same time, but as you can probably tell these don't fit the kid-a mold. Some of the stuff sounds like it could have gone on ok computer(knives out), some sounds like nothing they have ever done. The reason i give it a 4.5 is that it doesn't hold together as well as kid a, i don't like pull/pulk that much, its not bad by any means, but just really doesn't strike me, same goes for spinning plates, which is amazing done live. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is great, morning bell is better on here than on kid a <br /> <br />this is easily the bands most creative album, and is definately a gem, (i say this about all of their albums) however don't start here, the best way to experience radiohead is chronologically, this album will be better understood if bought after kid-a and all of its predecessors <br /> <br />Standouts: pyramid, you and who's army?, i might be wrong, knives out, life in a glass house <br /> <br />
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I'm a great fan of films which take one out of the day to day drearies and really do what films are meant to do in my opinion, ENTERTAIN. I'm certain that many film experts will totally overlook this point and criticize on content, plot, actors and several other aspects which make them sound like experts. Be that as it may. I rate this film 100% entertaining, full of the good old fashioned type of British humour with a great sound track. I'm English but have been living on the Continent for the last 30 years and it actually made me feel homesick. If you're looking for pure, lighthearted entertainment, it's exactly what the doctor ordered, and not just at Christmas either. Good the whole year round.
B000AP04FG|2.0|I decided why not let's see how well Brangelina do together on film that has sparked so much controversy off- stage. I don't see it honestly. These two did not in this film feel compatiable at all. I tried to see it, but I didn't. They just did not look like a belivable couple on- screen. They seemed like two over- hyped sex idols placed together in a film so critics can call it sexy as well as full of action and get a bunch of worshippers of these sex idols to come see the movie. And it works so well too, that's why they did it for they knew Pitt and Jolie had many worshippers.  <br />Yet honestly this movie was not good. It wasn't the most awful movie I had ever seen, and in the ending it did get somewhat better, but not enough. The beginning of the movie was drop dead boring, and again Brangelina did not to me make a belivable couple. I kept seeing nothing but two sex idols trying to look like the ultimate couple and it doesn't work honestly for me. Then shocker they're both liars and have secretive jobs where they use guns. The movie could have made it more interesting but they didn't. Like I said the ending got better- (especially when Brad and Angelina drop their guns and start fighting that is the only really good part of the movie)- but by then I was so bored of the lame jokes they made throughout the movie and all of a sudden they showing this great love for each other that seemed so forced that the movie couldn't be saved. If you cannot believe the relationship, and that is what the whole movie is centered on, then the movie is weak. And this movie is. I had good expectations for at least Pitt to carry out the movie well, as he usually does...but I don't know Pitt failed in this movie to me...too bad maybe next film Brad.  <br /> <br />But yeah I wanted to write this review to warn the readers that even though the plot sounds exciting- two highly paid sex idols given guns is not as good as it sounds. Just keep that in mind.
B00005RHGK|2.0|I would like to know cookieman exactly where you purchased your edition of Jeepers Creepers from. On your say-so, I purchased the edition available here since the one out here in Australia only has a director's commentary and being a big fan of this film, I wanted as much extra material as I could get. Guess what? It's the same edition....Where did you get it?
B000BYY0RY|5.0|I think it'll be hard for Kylie ever to top what she did with her Fever tour in 2002. I now some people found her too distant on that tour, the whole set-up being very mechanical, but to me it worked perfectly - there was a lot of show, yes, but it somehow managed to move the focus to the music more than anything, and her voice was absolutely amazing on the DVD from Manchester. <br /> <br />Exactly her voice I find to be somewhat lacking at this show. Yes, she does a spectacular version of Over The Rainbow, but she doesn't go for the high notes on Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquois and Dreams, and when she does go for the high notes, like in Confide In Me, she doesn't always quite make them. Oh, it's not bad, but it's not as good as on her previous show. Her voice is often quite week and thin, and she's drowned in the three backing singers on occasion. One cannot keep from having a ghastly feeling that this might have something to do with her cancer, diagnosed just a week after this show, but it might also just be it was not her best night. <br /> <br />Still, credit has to be given where it's due. The show is AMAZING. The stage set-up for Red Blooded Woman is unlike anything that's ever seen before, and this show is well worth getting to see this alone, if you're a fan at least and didn't make it to the show. Of course that's only one of many highlights - I love the weird costumes of the Smiley-Kiley medley (Do You Dare? / Shocked / What Do I Have To Do / Spinning Around / Step Back In Time), the solo dancer performing through In Denial and Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquois is excellent, the stage set-up for I Believe In You is beautiful, and the choreography for Your Disco Needs You is right on the spot. Perhaps the only thing that didn't work so well for me was the feather part of the 'Showgirl' opening set, can't really say why, but it wasn't as stunning as the rest of the show. <br /> <br />About her crew, one has to say that she's collected a group of extremely hot and at the same time very skilled dancers. Obviously the male dancers is a direct nod to her growing gay audience. The band is solid and competent and really doesn't get a lot of credit in this filming - most of the members only get one short camera shot - if any - during the two-hour show! <br /> <br />The set-list is great - she manages to cover everything from earliest to most recent, virtually all the great hits and several less known fan favorites as well. The performance of 'Dreams' is a huge favour to all her dedicated fans, who have wished for this song to enter the live set for years. Also, the way the show is arranged into 7 subsets - 'Showgirl', 'Smiley-Kiley', 'Denial', 'What Kylie Wants, Kylie Gets', 'Dreams', 'Kylesque' and 'Minx In Space' is BRILLIANT - the songs in each set has some sort of connection through theme, sound or lyrics, and like on the Fever tour, this makes the whole two-hour show seem very structured and with a red line connecting it all from beginning to end. <br /> <br />The sound and picture of this release is excellent. They've re-edited the show for DVD to make some distinction from the TV-recorded bootlegs; in reality the difference is minor, but ofcourse picture, mix and especially sound is better on the official release. <br /> <br />All in all I have to say that even if this is not Kylies best show, it's a must have for dedicated fan as well as casual listener. Do not miss the Fever Manchester 2002 DVD, though, and the Sydney 2001 DVD is a great concert as well. <br /> <br />OVERALL GRATE: 9 out of 10.
B000AP04FG|4.0|A movie that had a lot of humor and action combined! This is a movie recomended for EVERYONE (over the age of 13 of course). Four stars...why? Because There is great acting, a great plot, and great action-comedy mix.
B000255LNE|4.0|First I have to say: All of you reviewers, PLEASE look into the fact file before you blast out all sorts of wrong information here. For instance, True Colours on this set is not the studio version from the 1998 Hits collection, and Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away is not a new song, but is taken from his 1983 album Hello, I Must Be Going. <br /> <br />Well, but back to the review. This collection is an excellent idea, as a follow up to his sorely incomplete Hits CD from 1998. That CD could EASILY have been a double CD, and missed important songs like Don't Loose My Number, Do You Remember, Everyday, It's In Your Eyes, No Matter Who, I Don't Care Anymore, It Don't Matter To Me and I Missed Again (never a favourite of mine, but still a significant song) to name some. <br /> <br />That may be as it was, but these CDs seemed like an obvious opportunity to collect some of the overlooked songs, and also include some of the gems from his career that were never hits. And so it does - to some extent. Do You Remember?, Everyday, It's In Your Eyes, The Least You Can Do, This Must Be Love and Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away were all minor hits or single releases that missed the airwaves, and thus didn't make it to the Hits album. So, good to see them here. <br /> <br />Along with those are a handful of favourites that never made it as single, but which are among his most treasured works - Please Come Out Tonight, If Leaving Me Is Easy, Testify, I've Forgotten Everything and Can't Turn Back The Years. However, there are a lot of songs that SHOULD have been included on this list that didn't make it - We Fly So Close, The Same Moon, No Way Out, Why Can't It Wait `Til Morning, All Of My Life and You Know What I Mean are obvious examples. These songs range among his finest works, and would all have been absolutely obvious cuts on a `love songs' collection. Instead we get a dodgy collection of hits that were also on the Hits collection - One More Night, Against All Odds, Groovy Kind Of Love and Two Hearts to name some. True Colours and Separate Lives are also included for the second time, but these are included in live versions which would justify for a second re-release - in fact, this would have been a real treat for the fans, there are some amazing live recordings of One More Night (1997 tour) and Groovy Kind Of Love (1994 tour) that never made it to the fans, at least not from official sources. Also, some excellent live takes on Wish It Would Rain Down exist from the 1994 tour and would have made a nice surprise for the fans. <br /> <br />All that being said, there ARE some really nice things even for the die-hard fans here. There's only one new song - Tearing And Breaking - but it is indeed an excellent song, stunning vocal arrangement with the backing group. The new take on True Colours from the 2004-rehersals is well worth all the money for this collection in my opinion. It's a knock-out, way better than the 1998 version. Rare tracks I've Been Trying and Somewhere - and we are talking genuinely rare tracks here - are definitely aimed for the hardcore fan group. Somewhere is a really wonderful recording, I'm less enthusiastic about I've Been Trying, but it's not a bad song. The live take of My Girl was a surprise to me, I love this recording and I'm delighted that it made it onto this collection. The live version of Always is good, but I think he did it much better on the 1997 tour - this recording is from the 1990 tour. Another rare live recording is The Way You Look Tonight - not my favourite, but I appreciate that this rare track is included. <br /> <br />All in all, I think it's a good release - there are some genuine rarities here, and the inclusion of some live cuts make for a nice surprise as well. However, they could've made it even better: A lot of songs that were obvious takes didn't include it, and some more live recordings of the tracks already on the Hits release would've been awesome. Perhaps someday we will be treated with a full 4CD+ box set spanning Phil's career including ALL his hits as well as some of all the lost treasures in the live archive. That'd make at least one more happy man on Earth! <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: 8 out of 10. Fans will find something here and good for newcomers. <br /> <br />PS: A special \\"valentine\\" edition featuring a DVD with 6 rare videos exist for the dedicated follower. Price is not so much more than standard version.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This movie is SO good (not a fav - but GOOD)! It had a great historical plot combined w/ the wonderful acting of Kate Winslet (not Lienardo diCaprio) and a little humor and \\"sexy stuff\\" (jk). Anyway, this movie is great and is a movie u should get sometime soon.
B0009OPO0S|4.0|Shakira is such an beautiful inspiration to women like me who desire to be universal but unique, sexy but selective and talented but atypical.  I bought the album for \\"La Tortura,\\" featuring the salty, seductive Alejandro Sanz, but will keep it for \\"Obtener Un Si,\\" a gorgeous ambient song reminiscent of Brazilian Jazz favorites, like \\"The Girl from Ipanema.\\"  \\"Obtener Un Si\\" (\\"To Obtain a 'Yes'\\") is a song that comes onto you like a warm glass of sweet merlot taken in a balmy late summer bath.  Smoooth, soothing and e n t i r ely intoxicating! This girls lyrics are absolutely beautiful in Spanish, and when translated to English, her eloquent intelligence is a stiking pleasure.  I love her and wish her much more future success which would mean more fan pleasure. Such an amazingly artful, adept temptress.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Mmmm, this album is amazing. It's definitely different than Fijacion Oral, but it's still really good. I really recommend it.
B00000637V|5.0|Lou Reed's \\"Berlin\\" is perhaps the darkest album ever made. That said, it is a masterpiece. The subject matter is unremittingly bleak but the lyrics are startling in both their empathy and detachment. In \\"The Kids\\" Reed sings, \\"They're Taking Her Children Away\\", and it is about just that, chronicalling the disintegrating life of a single mother, \\"Caroline Says Pt 1\\" tells the tale of an uberbitch and the man who licks her boots, while \\"Caroline Says Pt 2\\" (same Caroline?) offers the contrast of a beaten and abused speed freak at the end of her rope. The utter apotheosis of despair is realized with \\"The Bed\\", in which a man takes us on a mordantly matter-of-fact tour of the apartment in which his wife, and the mother of his children lived, loved and killed herself. It is absolutely unapproachable as a hymn of resigned desolation. \\"This is the room where she took the razor...and I said, Oh, what a feeling.\\" The orchestration of \\"Berlin\\" is likewise stunning, ranging from full-on horns and strings (\\"Caroline Pt 1\\") to bare acoustic minimalism (\\"The Bed\\"). All in all there is nothing in music I can compare Lou Reed's \\"Berlin\\" to. It is perfect in its despair, but not for the clinically depressed.
B0000067L2|5.0|This may be heresy to some people, but Disraeli Gears is tied with \\"Days of future past\\" by the Moody blues as the best rock album of 1967. Yes, I even think both of them are better than Sgt.Peppers by the Beatles! The other albums just about as good as this from the late 60's are the Moody Blues \\"On the threshold of a dream\\", \\"Led Zeppelin II\\", and \\"Abbey Road\\" by the Beatles. This is not nearly as bluesy as \\"Fresh Cream\\", but it's got more good songs than that one does. I won't mention the two main hits because everybody knows those epic tracks, but the tunes that I like best are \\"SWLABR\\", \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"Dance the night away\\", \\"World of pain\\", \\"Take it back\\", and \\"Blue Condition\\". I don't have this remastered version, but have the first issue from the 80's, and it sounds just right to me sonically. This is the only Cream album that I ever liked totally, but each album had at least a handful of good tunes. Enjoy!!!
B0000009UX|5.0|The opening four songs of \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" are a simply amazing outpouring of Elvis at his finest; \\"Beyond Belief\\", \\"Tears Before Bedtime\\", \\"Shabby Doll\\", and \\"The Long Honeymoon\\" come at you like a brilliant bully, daring you not to be dazzled by their lyrical dexterity and musical diversity. \\"Beyond Belief\\" is that, with a spine tingling delivery of Elvis at-his-best lyrics that almost qualify as an instrument in itself. The first four are followed by \\"Man Out Of Time\\", which is fine also, and which manages to pull in the reigns of the almost out-of-control locomotive energy created by the first four songs. This definitely is a work of great ambition by an Elvis Costello at the peak of his songwriting powers, and its sprawl only occasionally dilutes the towering achievement of \\"Imperial Bedroom\\". \\"Town Cryer\\" is promising but never finds its edge, and is not helped by overproduction. In general it is the (over)production that is the only real weakness, and it's not a significant weakness. The sheer, raw talent of the young Elvis flexing his prodigious songwriting muscles more than compensates for a few too many horns.
B00006JKOL|5.0|I had owned this cd for about 15 years, but I sold it in about 2001. I think I only listened to it about two to three times at the most in the late 80's, but I just thought it was kind of boring and not much of an album, so I sold it to a used cd store. I just reaquired this from my BMG music club because I wanted to give it another chance. I don't know if I just wasn't paying attention or I was daydreaming while playing this before, but this stuff isn't bad at all. Now I'm not going to be a big fat fanatic like some of your reviewers are, because this isn't as great as say a &quot;Songs from the wood&quot;, &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, or &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot;, but this just might be in the top ten of their output. If you say that this is their best, I'd like to know what kind of stuff you're smoking! After the last time I listened to this back in the 80's, I really started getting into classical music, which can sometimes be pretty abstract as far as melody, and I think that might have helped me appreciate Jethro Tull's music a little bit more. I was reading someones review earlier that probably took some kind of music theory classes, and he was really ripping this album, but you have to realize that progressive rock music can be abstract at certain times, but still be very impressive to say the least. I'd like to see that reviewer assemble a progressive rock group, and I'd bet his melodic compositions would stink. Back to the cd itself. I never liked the title track, but now I can get into it after all these years. &quot;Cold wind to Valhalla&quot; was also a lot better this time around also. &quot;Baker St.Muse&quot; could be better if it didn't repeat that phrase so often, but it's still a solid track nonetheless. Could someone explain what the song &quot;One White Duck/010=Nothing At All&quot; means? I'd appreciate the answer? Sometimes, if you understand what a songs talking about, you can enjoy it all the more. I think Ian likes to see the fans confused as to what a song means just to make it look like he's so hip and intelligent, but still the song is great musically. Either make the last track &quot;Grace&quot; a longer piece, or don't bother to put it on the album at all. This is light years ahead of the preceding and following albums Warchild and To old to rock and roll, too young to die. I probably wouldn't  want to tell a newcomer to get this one as their first Tull purchase, because there are several albums better than this, but this could be right up some of your customers alleys, so to speak.

B000002L9M|5.0|Depeche Mode has never been the critics darling, at least not in the past 20 years. In the lists of top albums or bands they unfailingly fail to appear. Perhaps they're dismissed because they don't quite fit anywhere; are they synth-pop?, techno?, new wave?, goth? Yes they are, all of those. New Order has recently undergone a greatly deserved critical rehabilitation, as band after current band hail them as an inspiration. It is likewise, high time for another look at the remarkably fine string of albums made by DM from 1984-1987. There are four: \\"Construction Time Again\\"('84), \\"Some Great Reward\\"('85), \\"Black Celebration\\"('86), and \\"Music for the Masses\\"('87). All feature consistently inventive music, and each claim several amazing songs. While \\"Music for the Masses\\" sealed commercial success for Depeche Mode (Watch the documentary \\"Depeche Mode 101\\" to see just how popular they once were), it is \\"Black Celebration\\" that stands as an iconoclastic premonition of doom, and a beautiful doom it is. Opening with softly trilling synth riffs in the title track, DM's lush layers of sound begin to unfold themselves almost immediately. No other band has displayed such a deft, multi-faceted use of the synthesizer. \\"A Question of Lust\\" which follows is a DM trademark twisted love song. It was a top 40 hit, but it's the lesser known gems that shine most brightly. \\"Dressed in Black\\" says it all for those of us with a taste for dangerous women; \\"Oh. what can you do when she's dressed in black\\", and the short twin delights \\"Here Is The House\\" and \\"World Full Of Nothing\\" are poignantly awkward songs of intimacy desired. \\"Stripped\\" is \\"Black Celebration\\"'s magnum opus, starting with the low drone of Alan Wilder's synth, coupled with a railway-like click-clack, it slowly builds to an ominous crecendo as David Gahan intones \\"Let me see you stripped down to the bone.\\" Speaking of Wilder, I've come to the conclusion that it is his work that has given Depeche Mode its wholly unique texture; a weavework of sounds that challenge and tantalize the ear. The album closes with \\"But Not Tonight\\", a surprisingly optimistic offering in both word and music. The song's line \\"I haven't felt so alive in years\\" neatly illustrates that this was the high point of Depeche Mode. Lose your preconceptions and simply listen to \\"Black Celebration\\"; It's a feast for the ears.
B000007T1M|5.0|yeah great CD that DOESN'T sound anything like Mezmerize or Hyptonize. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />P.S. I haven't seen one reviewer who didn't give P.L.U.C.K. a 5/5
B000002H2Z|5.0|Other Cure offerings seem to generate more press, i.e. \\"Pornography\\" and \\"Disintegration\\", but \\"The Head on the Door\\" is without doubt their most fully realized, coherent and altogether brilliant work. The energy and originality is startling in itself to those who are most familiar with later mopier Cure. \\"In Between Days\\" is a rollicking romp to start the album, and is followed by the eerily isinuating \\"Kyoto Song\\", which contains some vintage Robert Smith lyrics \\"It's so smooth, it even feels like skin. Tells me how it feels to be knew.\\" Next comes \\"The Blood\\", which turns the focus from Asian eros to Flamenco tinged Middle Eastern mysticism (?!). The contrasts of style and content continue confidently in this vein throughout. From the deranged calliope reggae of \\"Six Different Ways\\" to the the fluid goth depression of \\"Sinking\\". Never again did The Cure manage such a strikingly energetic and original work. If you were to pick one Cure CD, make it \\"The Head on the Door.\\"
0684824906|5.0|This is absolutely the best Lincoln book written in the past decade...and I have read them all.  Highly readable and compelling to the finish.  Mrs. Kearns does it again!
B000002KBU|5.0|There is no other album quite like \\"Blue\\", either by Joni Mitchell or anyone else. Recorded following a dizzying period of early success as a songwriter and performer, and on the heels of her accomplished and popular \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\", \\"Blue\\" finds the artist at a personal and professional crossroads. What she does at that crossroads is bare her soul in a most profoundly intimate way. From the start Joni strips herself bare; \\"All I Want\\" finds her confessing to jealousy, obsession and a desire to shampoo and knit sweaters for the one she loves. This type of personal information could be unbearable in other hands, but Joni Mitchell is in her own league. and you want her to tell you more. She does. \\"California\\" is a world-weary ode, that only a jaded ex-hippie could write, \\"River\\" tells the story of a love destroyed by the singer, as she confesses \\"I'm selfish and I'm bad.\\" The imminently danceable (yes, danceable) \\"Carey\\". nonetheless betrays a resigned cynicism, but does so joyously. The pinnacle of the album, however is the oft-covered, \\"A Case of You\\", a love song of such yearning and pain that I have seen grown men cry when they hear it (myself included). It is simply the most perfect depiction of the often unbearable grip of love. The title track says it all in the first line, \\"Songs are like tattoos\\"; \\"Blue\\" is like a tattoo, once experienced, it never leaves you.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|I think it is safe to say that the original King Kong is a classic. It is in a class all it's own. Does the Peter Jackson remake do it justice? Absolutely. <br /> <br />First of all, the acting. It's great. I've never seen Naomi Watts like this. She is just as talented as she is pretty. Now, I'm not a big Adrien Brody fan, but in this movie, he does quite well. Jack Black does a fantastic job as the cocky, dishonest, unstoppable movie director Carl Denham. Andy Serkis shines also, both as Kong and Lumpy the Cook. <br /> <br />The special effects are absolutely stunning. King Kong is an amazing piece of CGI art. The Longneck Stampede scene is phenomenal, though many would beg to differ. The Kong vs. 3 T-Rex scene was good too. <br /> <br />The classic scene of Kong fighting the WW1 planes atop the Empire State Building was phenomenal. <br /> <br />I'd give it five stars if it wasn't for the length. It's definetely worth it, but buy a large popcorn to tide you over.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Having read the short story by Annie Prouix (which I thought was very good, but not particularly outstanding) and read so much about the movie before I got a chance to see it, I was actually prepared for a letdown if \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (2005) did not live up to my own expectations or the mega-hype in the media.  I'm happy to say that the hype is well justified, as \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is indeed a magnificient, flawlessly acted and directed, landmark film and the ultimate \\"love story\\" for our age.<br /><br />Two down-on-their-luck young cowboys, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), accept a summer job from a burly rancher (Randy Quaid) to tend a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming.  The closeness of working together leads to a physical and romantic relationship, one which Jack doesn't want to lose after the job is ended.  But this being Wyoming in the 1960's, the genuine affection they felt for each other was repressed in some \\"good ol' boy\\" horsing around, and they went their separate ways, with Jack going back to his family in Texas.  Several years later, and both married with children, they meet again and rekindle their relationship, getting together at Brokeback Mountain for regular \\"fishing trips\\" which Ennis' wife eventually gets wise about.  When Ennis' marriage ends, Jack shows up, willing to end his own marriage if Ennis would agree they should be together.  It has been almost 20 years since they first got together, but Ennis still assumes a \\"macho cowboy\\" facade and insists they cannot be together, despite an emotionally-wretching scene when they agree not to see each other for a while.  Keep the tissues handy for this one.<br /><br />Nominated for 7 Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Ang Lee, who absolutely redeemed himself for subjecting us to \\"The Hulk\\"), Best Actor (Heath Ledger, who showed an acting range of raw emotion not evident in any of his earlier work), Best Supporting Actress (Michelle Williams, who played Ledger's wife, and is today his real life live-in girlfriend and mother of the baby they recently had together), Best Screenplay and Best Original Song (\\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\").  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" also won 8 other awards at various film festivals and critic competitions,  and is sure to be a contender at Oscar time as well ... and it is all well deserved.<br /><br />Don't think of it as a \\"gay movie\\" or modern western.  Think of it as a parable of our times, and how our society can often keep true love from prevailing.  It's a message that anyone can relate to, and everyone can't help but feel. To paraphrase a review by Entertainment Weekly, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" redefines our concept of a love story, and has the power to deeply affect the minds and hearts of anyone who sees it.

B0002OERI0|1.0|I havent been a major fan of greenday, but i can remember singing along to the minority video in 3rd grade. Hell i even remember seeing longview on tv, and i think their older pre 2004 stuff isnt that bad. Unfortunately, this album gets repetetive and annoying. Maybe it is the radio overplaying it, but sorry, all you 13 year old teeneebopping girls who think otherwise, the songs arent that great. I always switch off my radio when they come on, i find them seriously iritating. Whenver i hear an old greenday song, i leave it on. This album proves a step down into the mainstreem MTV teenebopping pop world for greeenday, and i hope maybe someday they're return to their roots. <br /> <br />Avoid. <br /> <br />2/10.
B0009WFFS6|2.0|As a true Cream and British rock fan, this show is a complete disappointment.  I had high expectations and was really let down.  Clapton was, is, and will always be, one of my favorite musicians, but this was NOT Cream.  It was more like Clapton's newer pop stuff.  The 2005 show was completely watered-down, tired, and commercialized.  Jack Bruce was excellent on bass, but it just did not come close the the edgy intensity of the early days.  I guess I was expecting magic.  I should have rented it before I purchased it.  After watching this concert, I had to pop in the 1968 Farewell concert to get the horrible taste out of my mouth.
B0009I7O7U|4.0|It may be a little late to be just listening to John Legend's album Get Lifted, but like they say, better late than never. And when you hear people that don't even like listening to R&B say that they like this album, that tells you something. It's damn good.<br /><br />There are plenty of standouts on here, like \\"Used to Love U\\" and both versions of the title track. And \\"It Don't Have to Change\\" is a nice gospel-flavored track that has him and the Stephens Family reminiscing on how it used to be in the neighborhood. The funky \\"Stay With You\\" is also a highlight.<br /><br />John also does well when he lets the music dominate. We all know how great \\"Ordinary People\\" is, but another standout is when Miri Ben-Ari lends her strings to \\"Live It Up\\". And \\"So High\\" is aptly titled because I didn't expect John to be able to do falsetto very well, but he proved me wrong.<br /><br />Sometimes things can get a little corny, though. \\"Alright\\" has him steppin' up to the man that he stole his current girl from, and it really makes him seem like a poser. And as much as everyone likes \\"Number One\\", I think it's pretty okay, and it starts out with, \\"Now you can't say I don't love you/Just because I cheat on you.\\" Huh? Kanye's verse doesn't help matters either. Finally, \\"I Can Change\\" sounds exactly like \\"Used to Love U\\".<br /><br />Still, there are enough good songs on here to make up for those small missteps. So hurry up and check this album out if you haven't already, because Get Lifted will help you do just that.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000BBYMA2|1.0|I heard a lot of good things about this movie.  About how violent it was.  And such a cult favorite.  It has been available in most countries but not the U.S. for quite awhile.    I was very excited to watch this but I was severely disappointed.      It started out ok.  They presented the game and how 42(?) Japanese students would be brought to an island and would have to kill each other until only one survived, in a mildly humorous fashion.     But that was mediocre at best and was the end of anything interesting right at the start.    The rest of the movie is spent watching the students kill each other in uninteresting fashion.  So the reputation of outrageous violence turned out to be false in my opinion.    The major problem however is that there are too many possible relationships between 42(?) students to have time to examine them in the movie.      Obviously, the film doesn't examine them all, but it does do too many.  This movie continually presents a background relationship and resolves it with killing, all within a few minutes.   Then the same thing again and again. You never get to be involved with any of the characters' relationships before one kills another and you are presented with another one.      It's all pretty boring.  A huge disappointment.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Wow.  What a movie.  I loved it.  It's very moving and powerful and the fact that it's a true story is incredible in itself.  That there was actually a man like Coach Carter who could promote change amongst young kids who thought they were above reproach.  It tells the story of Carter taking over the coaching position at Richmond High and the changes he made in the lives of the players on the team.  He taught them the value of respecting themselves and others and the results of hard work.  I love it.  It's going to be one of my favourite movies.  The soundtrack is also great.  Samuel Jackson is great in everything he does, and this is no exception.  This is a must see movie for everyone.

074322454X|4.0|Excellent 1st hand accounts of the formation of the unit and the battles they fought.  Some parts are better than the HBO series while other parts in the HBO series are far more insightful than the book. <br /> <br />A key point of the book is how the unit managed to stay together and maintain its elite fighting effectiveness through their core NCO leadership.  The turmoil of the company commanders and soldiers through the casualties suffered made it difficult for the unit to maintain its unit integrity.  The unit spent over 2 years training together and it's effectiveness in having all volunteers made it even more special. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I have even more respect for the German Army's ability to rebuild and reconstitute their Divisions after having suffered far higher casualty rates in Russia and Normandy.  The 101st was extremely fortunate, as described by them, that they were pulled back to England to refit after Normandy and were not left fighting in the bocage and continue to suffer casualties like the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 29th Infantry Divisions. <br /> <br />One of the biggest complaints mentioned by the soldiers in the book was how the 101st was kept in the front line in Holland, to suffer additional casualties as regular infantry.  This is a key point on the effectiveness of soldiers and units overall.  A unit's effectiveness will degrade overtime and should be rotated out of the front line to rest, refit, and prepare for future operations.  This coincides with David Hackworth's book on Vietnam, Steel My Soldier's Hearts, where he would rotate his units from active operations into the base camps to refit. <br /> <br />The author is not very objective and sides heavily with those he is interviewing.  The only gripe with this biased is in regards to the Battle of the Bulge where the author claims that the Germans enjoyed a better quality of life with more food and better living conditions than the 101st.  If one reads other books on the Battle of the Bulge and other 1st hand accounts of the German side, this misperception becomes very apparent.  Fighting in the extreme cold of winter is not enjoyable for any of the participants and non-combatants.  Of course if one is in the middle of a hostile force, like the 101st was in Bastogne, receiving warm food and supplies would be difficult.   <br /> <br />David Perrigan's book, 1st Across the Rhine, is another good book to read on the US Engineers fight on the northern half of the Battle of the Bulge and how difficult is was for all the soldiers fighting in the winter. MacDonald's book, The Hurtegen Forest, is an excellent book on the fighting that led before the Battle of the Bulge.  The 1st and 28th Infantry Divisions suffered heavily in the forest fight fighting where their replacements were quickly received, sent into the fight, and then became casualties. <br /> <br />An eye-opener in the Band of Brothers was how it mentioned that German POW's were executed, to include how a young Dutch boy was accidentally shot in one incident.  This is perhaps the one of the saddest and most disappointing aspects of the book, learning how our US military had executed POW's.  The US rally cry in the Battle of the Bulge is to remember the Malmedy Massacre and the atrocities of the SS.  But here the reader finds out that some individual US soldiers executed POW's.  Very disappointing, but it is very honest, candid, and open to admit to such events.   <br /> <br />One key point on training and leadership is depicted very well in their training in the US and England prior to Normandy.  A person can be an excellent trainer in preparing soldiers to fight, but it does not necessarily make them a leader who they respect and have faith in completing the mission while maximizing their chances of returning home alive.   Major Winter's leadership and views are very informative.  <br /> <br />Overall, a good book and tribute to the heroic efforts performed by the soldiers of EasyCompany.  <br /> <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|Wow. I spent about an hour at the music store, sampling the music of just about every Metal band there was. I had heard Opeth before, I own one of their older albums, but I skipped them and kept looking. I don't know, I just wanted to see if any other band out there could impress me. Finally, I popped \\"Ghost Reveries\\" into the scanner. I just could not believe how amazing these guys are. This is the most innovative band out there today still using Death Metal style vocals. Period. The only one I can think of to rival them is Cynic, but they're long gone. It is very hard to describe Opeth's music with words. The vocalist goes from the most guttural growls to a soothing, brooding voice. The music incorporates a vast variety of timbres, textures, moods, and techniques. It goes from heavy riffing, to soothing piano/mellotron/clean guitar sections, to mathematically complex rythms that sometimes recall Meshuggah, like another reviewer mentioned. But, whereas Meshuggah's music is mostly a monolith of heaviness, sticking to minimalist repetition, Opeth's music veers off into very different musical spheres, even within one song. Take it from a (relatively) old guy. I am 30 years old, and a musician - I have listened to Metal since the late 1980's, so it is very hard to impress me. Yet Opeth have certainly earned my respect and admiration. If you like to be challenged, if you like your music to take you into uncharted journeys, then Opeth is just the band for you. Opeth should be hailed as the true innovators that they are. Metal music is a much richer genre thanks to them.  I am definitely going to explore all of their music, and you should, too.

B0006L0LOS|1.0|That's something that bugs me - agreeing with everyone else on here. Take something else I've reviewed, some reality TV dreck, I dunno - usually it's just full of reviews like \\"Shayne really steals the show with his cover of Dancin' In The Moonlight, and now I luv this show 4eva and I luv Shayne 4eva\\" by some mindless pondlife, then along comes The Curmudgeon and gives The Truth.<br /><br />But here, it's both too easy and too hard. See, it's too easy because EVERYONE is slating this movie - every review is 2 stars or less and everyone is saying the same thing - that the movie sucks. And here's where it's too hard - it's too hard NOT to join in, because the movie is THAT bad.<br /><br />A lot of people like to bunch together bad comic book movies as a discussion piece, and Catwoman will join that infamous list as its most recent calamity (but by no means the worst - step forward Supergirl for that honour). Now, box office flops usually get put alongside the bad ones, but just because they didn't do well financially doesn't make them bad (the Phantom and the new Punisher are two common names thrown in. Phantom was an excellent homage to the classic 30's serials, giving an old-fashioned sense of adventure with a likable hero, albeit in a silly costume and Punisher was just all kinds of awesome).<br /><br />Catwoman, however, deserved to tank the way it did. And the likes of Phantom and Punisher didn't have either the cash or the media exposure this film did. As much as she attempts to save face nowadays (her post-modern, tongue in cheek \\"victory speech\\" as she won worst actress), Halle Berry promoted the HELL out of this film, and she really did think she was, ahem, the cats whiskers, trying to convince us all on numerous talk shows that this Catwoman was the sexiest thing on the screen.<br /><br />And, lord, is it quite the opposite. Berry's catwoman is as alluring and sexy as some urine-soaked tramp sitting next to you on a bus. She ranges from acting really badly to just being plain embarrassing. When she's normal Patience Phillips (oh dear) she's bearable, if not exactly Oscar worthy (as she once was), but when she becomes Catwoman you really will be watching through your fingers as she says Miaow, \\"purrrrrrrfect\\", gets scared of the rain and hisses at dogs. Yes, all of this happens.<br /><br />Add to the mix stereotypical sassy girlfriend, token gay guy making \\"funny faces\\" at her boyfriend, a ridiculous Sharon Stone and some beyond dodgy CGI and you have one movie that no amount of \\"taking it on the chin\\" good naturedness will save.<br /><br />Nice Catwoman documentary on the DVD, mind.

0316548189|5.0|Wow, what an inspiring book.  It was recommended to me by a South African, whose ethnic background is Caucasian, that to learn about South Africa's recent history and culture, one should read this book. <br /> <br />This book is truly amazing and very, very informative.  The civil rights struggle for equality and equal treatment is vividly depicted.  The decades spent to peacefully open the government policies so that the citizens of the country can equally share the benefits and contribute to the improvement of their society is remarkable. <br /> <br />One important point is that many individuals did not share their government's oppressive policies and many, regardless of ethnic background, supported Mr. Mandela.  His ability to unite a divided country is truly inspiring. <br /> <br />If one wants to learn how difficult it is to live as a second class citizen, with very restrictive policies in a police state, this book is it.  We in the US are very fortunate to have many freedoms and opportunities that we often take for granted.  After reading this book, I am very thankful that we are a united country where we promote based on a person's ability to perform, not their ethnic or religious background.  <br /> <br />Reading Colin Powell's autobiography \\"My American Journey\\" one also gets a good view on how we in the US can achieve based on our own accomplishments once given a open, honest, and fair opportunity to perform our job. <br />

B00005LQ04|5.0|\\"Suspiria\\" has been acclaimed as director Dario Argento's masterpiece. And it certainly is. The plot is fairly simple. American ballet student Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend an exclusive ballet school. Once there, she discovers that there is more going on within than just dance instruction. Although the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) welcomes her warmly, she is unsettled by her aide, Nazified teacher Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), as well as several mysterious student disappearances. When her new friend Sara (Stefania Casini) is the latest to vanish, Susy begins her own investigation of the academy. Filmed in bright, lurid Technicolor, and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by Goblin, Suspiria is a nightmare-come-to-life. The performances of Harper, Bennett and especially Valli (like Bennett, a major star of the Golden Age) are solid, as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. Also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. Argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on Walt Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" and, indeed the similarities are apparent. \\"Suspiria\\" may not always make perfect sense plot wise, but it's a thrilling roller-coaster ride through what may very well be Hell. \\"Susperia\\" ranks as one of the best Italian-made horror films of all time.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|The faults of King Kong are without a doubt overshadowed by the sheer entertainment and spectacle, but the faults, I think, will keep it from getting a best picture award. It'll get technical awards and MAYBE a best actress? Yet, it's still a fantastic movie and in my opinion, the best movie of the year.<br /><br />First off, I think Kong Kong has some pacing issues. You know, I'm not one of the people that hates long movies. In fact, I'm just the opposite. If I'm INTO THE MOVIE... give it to me! In fact, I'm sort of hoping that there will be a director's cut, because I know there was stuff missing.<br /><br />After watching King Kong, I couldn't help but think that some key scenes were missing.  The journey home. The jump from chloroforming Kong to the show night was uncomfortable and lacked build up.<br /><br />I also thought they spent too much time in the early stages, especially on the boat. The early scenes seemed to go slow and were meticulous. Then the closing scenes... starting with Kong's chase on the island until the end of the movie, seemed to go WAY TOO FAST and didn't spend time delivering emotional impact. They should have been less meticuous in the beginning and more meticulous in the end.<br /><br />Also, there were times when the green screening didn't look all that great... like the dinosaur rampage and a couple of other places. In other places, the green screen and f/x were SO GOOD, that you wouldn't even think that you were looking at an effect. Otherwise, the movie delivered on all levels.<br /><br />It had great performances. Especially by Naomi Watts. She's been robbed two years in a row of an oscar. They'll give her one this time because she should have won the last 2 years.<br /><br />The time period was a great choice. From the moment that the adventures/moviemakers set foot on Skull island, the movie shifts into high gear and never again lets up. Dazzling action sequences! Touching moments between Anne Darrow (Watts) and Kong. Especially when Kong sees what his little barbie toy can do.<br /><br />Finally, the ending sequence was AMAZING! Breathtaking as Kong pounded his chest atop the Empire State Building. The camera circled with the planes and it was awe inspiring to watch.<br /><br />King Kong is phenominal and WITHOUT A DOUBT something that HAS TO BE SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN! Kong won't look as big on your little T.V. at home. It's a must see. See it for the action. See it for the love story. You won't be sorry.do.    Finally, the ending sequence was AMAZING!

B00005JLIU|5.0|\\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" is a thoroughly wonderful movie! With stars like Julie Andrews, Carol Channing and Beatrice Lillie, how can you lose?. The answer: You can't! Splendid songs, dances and a sometimes hilarious script blend into top entertainment. Julie Andrews stated she took the role because she didn't have much longer to play ingnue parts. And she couldn't have chosen better. She is perfect as Mllie, the Kansas innocent (with a forgivably British accent) who comes to the Big City (circa 1922) to land a rich husband. At the same time, she meets \\"Miss\\" Dorothy Brown (an appealing Mary Tyler Moore), a self-described \\"rich orphan\\" out to experience life among the working girls. A chance meeting with Jimmy Smith (James Fox, currently in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\") leads to a meeting with fabulously wealthy playgirl Muzzy Van Hossmere (Carol Channing) and a series of delightful mishaps. Along the way, Millie becomes enamored of her handsome boss, Trevor Graydon (John Gavin) and learns the REAL occupation of her mysterious landlady, Mrs. Meers (Beatrice Lillie). All of the performers are \\"just swell\\", but inevitably, Lillie and Channing (who got an Oscar nomination) stand out, and there is a terrific turn by Cavada Humphrey as a formidable office manager. A typically polished Ross Hunter production, original songs by Sammy Cahn And James Van Heusen, and a musical background of standards by Oscar-winner Elmer Bernstein make this \\"Thoroughly Irresistible!\\" [phillindholm]
B000000OAL|5.0|Many people forget just how BIG Queen was. At one time, they were the number 1 worldwide concert draw. They weren't just a concert, they were a much-anticipated event- tremendous energy, powerful, loud, and very entertaining. They had personality and presence. They were expert musicians, each one classically trained, and held in reverence by many other musicians. This was the album that started it all. 'Queen I' is a classic. 'Keep Yourself Alive'and 'Liar' were commercial hits. 'Great King Rat', 'Modern Times Rock 'N' Roll' and 'Seven Seas of Rhye' showcase Brian May's guitar work (very progressive for its time), and 'Doin' Alright' and 'Night Comes Down' give us the earliest hints of the incredible voice Freddy Mercury had, and the talent he was blessed with. In fact, they were all very talented. This one is a must for anyone who likes Queen. 'Queen I' is one of the twenty, or so, best debut albums of all time.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|When I first listened to this soundtrack, I couldn't stand it at all.  But the second time around of listening, I started to gradually like it.

Ms. Menzel provides beautiful vocals in the show-stopping \\"Defying Gravity\\" and steals the show in this wonderful musical. A must buy for all Broadway fans.
B000001F5F|4.0|What makes this the best live material is the fact that they are young and hungry enough to follow their original musical muse instead of trying to show off their versatility or \\"diversity\\" like they do throughout their later, more mannered recordings; some of their later albums struck me as rock music versions of castor oil.    I am removing one star from my rating because of the track order - the finale of the early 80's shows was always \\"Gloria\\" which I will always regard as their best live song and thus perfect in that spot, followed by \\"I Will Follow\\" as the first encore.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" is an animated film based on Chris Van Allsburg's children's Christmas book. The book is only 29 pages long, and this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, so additional material has been extrapolated from Van Allsburg's story. It tells the tale of a young boy who is beginning to doubt the existence of Santa Claus, flying reindeers, and Christmas magic. He awakes in the middle of the night before Christmas to find that a train, the Polar Express bound for the North Pole, has stopped in front of his house. The conductor persuades the boy to climb aboard, and it's off to the North Pole to see Santa Claus give out the First Gift of Christmas and begin his whirlwind journey to deliver gifts to all the world's children. But not before the boy has some adventures on board the train with the other children passengers.<br /><br />In making \\"The Polar Express\\", director Robert Zemeckis wanted to recreate the style of Chris Van Allburg's oil painting that illustrate the book. He needed a method of animating the film that could do that, yet convey subtlety and realism in performances from the actors. Zemeckis used a motion capture system designed by Ken Ralston at Sony Pictures Imageworks, which they called \\"Performance Capture\\". The actors are filmed wearing form-fitting \\"mo-cap\\" suits studded with reflective markers, which are also applied to their faces, so their body language and expressions can be used as a blueprint for the animation. The amazing thing about this is that the actors' performances are preserved even when their appearance is altered dramatically by the animators. Tom Hanks plays 5 roles in the film, including the little boy protagonist! The little boy looks nothing like Hanks, and yet Hanks was able to physically act the role. Adult actors Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen also play children. They were filmed against sets 160% normal size to get the scale right for their young characters. Michael Jeter plays both the train engineer and its fireman, one of whom is fat and one skinny.<br /><br />The results of the animation are truly impressive. \\"The Polar Express\\" looks like an oil painting come to life. There are some really beautiful scenes. And the characters seem so much like live action characters that I was a little perplexed while I watched it. I thought this must be a live action film shot against a green screen and digitally animated, but I wondered how that was possible with a cast of child actors. Reading about the film afterwards solved the mystery. That must have been some shoot with everyone wearing leotards and Tom Hanks often playing 2 characters in the same scene! In any case, \\"The Polar Express\\" is one of the better Christmas movies I've seen, digital effects aside. Adults will enjoy some laugh-out-loud moments and entrancing scenery as well as children. It's bound to become a Christmas classic.and its fireman, one of whom is fat and one skinny. <br /> <br />The results of the animation are truly impressive. \\"The Polar Express\\" looks like an oil painting come to life.

B00092ZMDY|2.0|I grew up with and loved the Eagles' music.  Still love a lot of it, in fact.  So, I was looking forward to seeing them in concert for the first time.  I'd heard rumors that they were never a good live band, but I figured hey, it's the Eagles, it should be enjoyable, right?    Wrong.  This was the most boring live concert I have ever seen, bar none.  Lifeless, sterile, humorless.  No innovation, no chances taken, no spark whatsoever.  I felt like I was watching a bunch of Disney animatronics.    Sure, the sound was great.  The songs sounded EXACTLY like they do on the record.  Exactly the same notes, exactly the same vocal inflections, exactly the same harmonies, exactly the same arrangements, exactly the same guitar solos, exactly the same length.    All the while, the band stands nearly motionless, except for \\"going through the motions\\" of playing the songs.  This is the distinct feeling I got -- an extremely sterile, commercial display of a band that simply went through the motions, period.    And so I ask you:  Where the heck is the fun in THAT?  If I want to listen to the record, I'll listen to the record.  But I go to concerts to see the artists take some chances, do some things differently, and above all, to connect with the performers and the audience in a memorable way.  The Eagles made no effort to connect with the audience.  It was all so textbook-dry, I was actually looking at my watch, even during old classic songs that I liked.    This was also one of the few rock concerts I've ever been to in Los Angeles where the audience sat down the entire concert.  Hint:  If you can't get an L.A. audience on their feet by the second or third song, something is wrong.    Everything was just so boring and completely predictable.  The only guy that threw a tiny (not much more than tiny, though) bit of fun into the proceedings was Joe Walsh.  But even that seemed contrived.  He was sort of the \\"designated funny guy\\" in the show, dressing up in a silly outfit and construction hardhat during one segment.  I may be too cynical, but it was as if the band had thought all of that out beforehand.  \\"Here, Joe, you be the 'light entertainment'.\\"    So in short:  It was a real snooze-fest.    OK, so one of my family members buys this DVD.  Guess what?  It is EXACTLY the same concert we saw (even though I saw them in Los Angeles and this concert is in Australia, and the fact that Don Felder wasn't present).  But still, it's exactly the same concert.  Right down to the supposedly \\"off the cuff\\" comments between songs.  It's actually an amazing thing, because it seems that no human would be able to so completely script a live show, right down to exact  word-for-word comments between songs, and right down to the cynical smirk on Henley's face.  Yes, I believe they actually ARE Disney animatronics!!    Buy this only if you're interested in seeing how a band can absolutely duplicate a studio sound in concert.  That's the only part that actually is impressive from a technical standpoint, even if it is supremely boring.  Or buy it, of course, if you need a good snooze.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|I have a love/hate relationship with this album.  There are many things I love about it - the highly skilled musicianship, the large variety, the intracate rhythms, the fact that its so popular and yet so unlike anything happening in music right now, and in many ways quite un-commercial.  However, this album has one over-bearing flaw that keeps all those great things from making this a great album - the lack of focus.  The band will mindlessly drift from one idea to the next with no sense of direction or even reason for doing so, other than perhaps they are on LSD, and there is way to much filler in between the genious.  In other words - for every minute of good stuff in this album, there are two minutes of crap. <br /> <br />A perfect example is the first song, \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus.\\"  For the first several minutes of this song, I was astounded.  The intracate melodies on top of the chaotic yet precice jazz-like instruments with heavy metal distortion I found to be an amazing concept, almost worthy of something that Frank Zappa would do.  When I looked at how long this was, I was shocked - 13 minutes.  But I'm only through 8 minutes and it sounds like the songs starting to wind down.  Could they possibly keep this song going?  The answer - no.  The majority of the rest of this song is just noise, something that the band and many fans may refer to as \\"art,\\" but I think that its just filler that pulls you away from the amazing piece of music that they just layed in front of you. <br /> <br />The album continues in this vain for pretty much the entire album, which is entirely to long.  Remember, guys, a 35-40 minute album with pure awesome music is much better than a nearly 80 minute album which still only has about 35-40 minutes of actually good music.  Length is not everything.  The next song, \\"The Widow,\\" is a perfect piece of pop music, with catchy, Robert Plant-like wailing and fun, bluesy guitar licks.  But unfortunately, it too is plagued with the distracting, unnecessary noise during the last 2 minutes of the song, which would have been perfectly good if it weren't for that damn noise. <br /> <br />\\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" is the only song that really deserves to be as long as it is.  Its a very spanish sounding song that brings back memories of when Santana put out good albums (it has a great guitar solo in it).  But unfortunately the next song, \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" (does anybody know what the hell these guys are talking about?) is the worst violator of the filler point.  The first 4 minutes is just birds chirping, wind blowing, and somebody making ambient singing noises.  4 minutes!  Even Yes would find that excessive, come on guys.  The rest of the song doesn't get much better, its barely what I would classify as \\"music,\\" it has the most boring and annoying melody on the whole album.  Even when very late in the song they start doing some interesting stuff with trumpets, it hardly makes a difference as your already too bored by the first 10 minutes to even really take notice. <br /> <br />Surprisingly, the 32 minute final song, \\"Cassandra Gemini,\\" is the best song on here.  But before we get into the music, lets consider this concept - 32 freakin' minutes.  That's longer than a TV show.  Its longer than any song Rush ever wrote.  You could probably run 3 miles and when you finish, this song would still be going.  Now, is that really neccacary, guys?  I mean, be honest, did you do it because you really thought that it needed to be over a half an hour, or did you do it just so you can say, \\"Hey, guess what?  One of our songs is 32 minutes long!\\"  That said, the music stays interesting for a surprisingly long time, given these guys' track record.  I'd say for the first 20 minutes they actually had my attention, it was pretty well done.  But still, MAKE THE SONG 20 MINUTES THEN, DON'T STRETCH IT OUT FOR ANOTHER 12 FREAKING MINUTES! <br /> <br />So, I still like this album, and ultimately I criticize because I love, because the musicainship is amazing and it really sticks it to modern songwriting ideas that music has to be 3:30 and go verse chorus verse chorus, which I can certainly appreciate.  But the guys in the band definitely went way over board with it.  They really do have enough potential to make an amazing album, and I think that next time around if their album is more focused, its likely to win my vote for album of the year.  However, that said, this is a relatively mediocre album just because of their tendencies to go off on stupid tangents.  Its a shame too, this album really has a lot of potential.
B00003CXC7|2.0|Compared to psychological thrillers like Psycho and Vertigo, this movie was disappointing at best. Rear Window is very slow and boring, and the audience loses its attention through much of the film. Of course the ending was surprising in typical Hitchcockian fashion, but there was no tension built through the film so the ending was very anti-climatic. However, I still recommend this film...if you want to catch a nice nap.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Quite a few shallow individuals, it appears, are clinging to the false notion that this breathtaking and profoundly heart-wrenching motion picture offers nothing new or noteworthy. Having now experienced the film for myself, I can testify to you here that this is very simply not the case.    Ang Lee has crafted the one feature film that audiences will be discussing for many long years to come. The buzz it generates, contrary to what some may otherwise believe, will not cater to the media's recent and over-exaggerated abuse of the words \\"bravery\\" or \\"courage.\\" Especially not as such terms relate to Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger and their joint decision to star in this production. More specifically, I tend to believe that most of the talk \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" promotes will more than likely entail just how openly honest and heartfelt its story of true love really is. Director Lee is the one man who should be labelled brave. He, working directly from the Annie Proulx short story, has given us a revolutionary firsthand view of a deeply-rooted relationship that was, for the time period it was set against, considered gravely taboo. The year 1963, one must remember, was far and away removed from the tolerable climate of today's modern society. I had not been alive to experience the sixties, I grant you. But that doesn't necessarily mean I am unable to identify with the altogether cruel strife these characters endured. The heinous societal pressure hanging over Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist cuts to the very core of what each and every gay person across this world has been forced to confront. Director Lee, with this film, has shined an ever-revealing light upon the ignorance of bigotry and the unfortunate lengths its victims must travel to avoid the rejection of friends and family. We feel the angst within Jack and Ennis, their sheer emotional passion and, ultimately, the genuine frustration of realizing they can never openly embrace their mutual attraction. It all comes down to fear. You should never be afraid to love another person, regardless of whether a total stranger agrees with it or not. My entire adolesence had passed me by before I realized that truth for myself at the age of twenty one.    I and my spouse of fourteen years were in a theater, way out in the suburbs, on opening day to experience this film amongst a packed house with varying cross-sections of people young and old alike. Not a single one of them, I should mention, got up and left throughout the entire showing. There are simply no sufficient words for me to adequately describe just how powerful and totally touching this movie's driving message proved. In my entire life, I cannot recall a time I ever saw so many members of the crowd as positively touched as they were by \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" This is clearly one feature film that everybody should award its proper due. It may not change the minds of those who unfortunately still shun homosexuality in general. But, I can almost certainly guarantee, that it will open many eyes to a truth that those in higher authority still choose to ignore. Love, no matter how you may look at it, is what it is and is never wrong.    I will be recommending this movie to everybody I know for as long as the air in my lungs will permit me to do so. It deserves every one of the nominations it has received and is a definite contender for Best Picture. Ang Lee, Ms. Proulx, take a bow and thank you both very much.
0064409422|3.0|C.S. Lewis was born in Belfast in 1898. In 1916, he won scholarship to University College, Oxford. He was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford in , working there as tutor in English Language and Literature for 29 years, before leaving for Magdalene College, Cambridge. He died in 1963, on the same day John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Aldous Huxley died. \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\", the first of his books to be set in Narnia, was originally published in 1950. Although it was the first book written in a series of seven, it isn't necessarily the best place to start - there are many who view \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" as the 'proper' starting point for the series.     The book opens during the Second World War and tells the story of four children evacuated from London. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie have been sent to live with an old Professor who lives deep in the countryside. Initially, the children hope their stay will involve a spot of bird watching and generally bothering the local wildlife. However, following some exploration indoors, those pesky kids discover a wardrobe that leads to another world called Narnia. Narnia is ruled by the evil Jadis, better known as the White Witch. Under her rule, it is always winter, but Christmas never comes. Luckily Aslan, a very powerful lion and the rightful King, is rumoured to be close and the children's presence seems to confirm the White Witch's time is nearly up. (An ancient prophecy mentions the two 'Sons of Adam' and two 'Daughters of Eve'). Unfortunately, Edmund - a sneaky little brat - likes Turkish Delight too much for everyone's good.     I did enjoy the book as a kid - however, unlike the Potter books I can't honestly see too many adults also enjoying it. It is very old fashioned - the writing is very similar to Enid Blyton's, which isn't something I like too much - while the ending (particularly the battle) was an anti-climax. It also suffers in comparison to Tolkien's books, where the writing is much less childish and which also have the benefit of a carefully designed fictional world. The Christian element is also present which will, no doubt, please some - while I didn't notice it as a kid, it's pretty clear reading the book as an adult. However, I can't help thinking this would've been a much better book if it hadn't been written as some sort of allegory.
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater is a band that knows how to make a good album.  All of the songs here flow perfectly into each other, each song is exactly what the album needs.  When \\"6:00\\" starts, its exactly how you want an album to start - its a fast paced heavy metal song with some very intricate guitar and keyboard playing.  This is basically done once again in the only slightly-heavier \\"Caught in a Web.\\"  The band does an amazing job at balancing out song structures and pure self-indulgence, and never lets their talent out do the songwriting. <br /> <br />After the two very tight, well made introductory songs, we're confronted with a new style of Dream Theater magic - the slower, almost ballad-like, and quite catchy \\"Innocence Faded.\\"  The song is very Queensryche reminiscent, an almost prog-metal-pop song.  Then the band gets to one of the greatest songs on here - Eratomania.  Considering the name, plus the fact that its a nearly 7-minute instrumental made me expect it to be very self indulgent and masturbatory.  However, its actually quite restrained and the band relies much more on moving the song along with melody and structure rather than Steve Vai-like endless soloing. <br /> <br />After that we are treated to a quite long but pleasant song, \\"Voices\\".  As with the previous song, I'm impressed with the band's ability to hold back their egotistical desires in favor of the listenability of the song.  Definitely one of my favorites off the album.  After the long, heavy and complexness of \\"Voices,\\" the band plays the perfect song to precede it - the (comparatively) simple, quiet, acoustic song \\"The Silent Man.\\"  It really makes a good breather, the eye of the storm, if you will, sandwiched between two of the heaviest songs on the album.  After the calm, comes \\"The Mirror,\\" probably the heaviest song on the album.  In the early parts of the song, there is some quite interesting rhythms happenening, with the guitar repeating the heavy chug-a-chug-a-chug while the drums experiment playing some very sincopated beats.  Very fun to listen to.  Then they play \\"Lie,\\" another very heavy song which features some of the coolest guitar riffs you'll ever hear. <br /> <br />Then the band goes into yet another shift in styles.  \\"Lifting Shadows Off a Dream\\" is for the most part a somewhat lighter song, with a beautiful chorus that sort of reminds me of something that U2 would do (only, you know, not crappy).  After the 3:30 mark, the song gets a little heavier, but never loses its omnipresent delicacy that makes it such an interesting number.  \\"Scarred\\" is a another very long track, and thank god for that, because its brilliant.  The mood in the song is constantly changing, and you never really know what's coming next.  Plus, towards the later half of the song, there is some really awesome soloing between the guitar and keyboards, and the guitarist really shows his diversity - between Van Halen-like speed and a talent for picking very melodic notes, he does a little bit of everything on this song. <br /> <br />\\"Space-Dye Vest\\" is probably the most different sounding song on here.  Its mostly driven by a gorgeous piano and vocals.  There is also some strange quotes from TV shows and movies, I'm not really sure the point to this, but its sort of interesting. <br /> <br />I wasn't really sure what to expect when I listened to this cd.  It was my first introduction to Dream Theater, and it looks like I picked a great album to start with.  Overall, it far surpassed what I was expecting it to be, great job guys.  This one is very highly recommended.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is the best horror film of all time. While new horror films rely on gore, Psycho uses tension, suspense, and a great score to thrill the audience. The shower scene is one of the most unforgettable scenes in cinematic history. Even more shocking is the staircase scene. Andy Perkins delivers what many consider his career defining performance. Current horror movies aren't scary; they are ridiculous spectacles of violence against teens and women. However, this movie set the benchmark that all of these new horror movies imitate. Most horror flicks make the audience flinch in disgust at certain brutal scenes, but this movie haunts the audience with psychological tension, and this makes Psycho much scarier than any movie out there. The remake of the film was a disgrace, mostly due to Vince Vaughn's unsympathetic portrayal of Norman Bates. In summary, all horror movies can't compare to Psycho. Gain some culture and watch this movie.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Okay, maybe not THE funniest, but it's Monty Python's best, and Life of Brian aint too shabby (nor the Meaning of Life, but it's the weakest). This movie is one of the most quotable in history, with quotes you probably know even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br /> The movie starts out with King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his loyal servant Patsy (Terry Gilliam) galloping...wait, is Patsy clapping two coconuts together to symbolize a horse running? Wacky! Then they encounter a man above in a castle who won't let them past because he doesn't understand where they got the coconuts. Then a man collecting bodies (Eric Idle) during the Black Plague is swindled by another man (John Cleese) to kill a perfectly healthy old man because he'll be dead soon anyway. Need I go on? Okay, Arthur bickers with a 37-year-old beggar named Dennis, who he mistakes for a beggar woman, and he encounters the Black Knight (Cleese again), who even with no legs and arms, never gives up (\\"I'll bite your legs off!\\"). Arthur recruits Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones, also directing), who is in a heated argument about whether or not a woman (Connie Booth) is a witch and suggests weighing her against a duck (don't ask).<br /><br /> Think I've given away most of the movie? That's just the first 15 minutes. I haven't gotten to the tale of Sir Lancelot (hey, Cleese!), which has a wedding day massacre; Sir Robin (Idle), accompanied by his singing minstrels, who flees (\\"I didn't!\\") from a three-headed bickering giant; Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), who is gallantly rescued by Lancelot from a castle full of hot virgins (\\"I bet you're gay!\\"); the Bridge of Death; the evil bunny; Tim the Enchanter (by Jove, John Cleese); the French knight (guess who); the Trojan Rabbit; the-<br /><br /> Whuh? Oh, this isn't a review, huh? Well, basically, if you don't own this movie, you hate laughing. No, I'm serious. DUN DUN, DUN DA DUN DUN DUN DUN- Sorry, I get carried away, sorry!
0743454537|5.0|Anna, a 13 year old, had been an IVF baby specifically created to be a genetic match for her older sister Kate who was dying from leukaemia. Throughout her short life she has undergone painful procedures in order to donate various parts of her to her sibling. No one ever asked Anna what she felt about this or questioned her willingness to be a donor. When Kate goes into renal failure it is assumed that Anna will donate a kidney to her. It is at this point Anna approaches an attorney and asks him to represent her, in a case against her parents, for the rights to her own body.<br /><br />The book doesn't merely narrate Anna's story but also gives the views of Kate, Sara and Brian (her parents), Jesse, (her delinquent brother), her lawyer Cameron and Julia, the court appointed guardian. Sara wants to keep Kate alive no matter the cost, Brian wants everyone to be happy, Jesse feels neglected and left out, an `after thought'. What quickly becomes clear is that there is no black or white, just shades of grey, no easy answers and an awful moral and ethical dilemma. Is it right to use a child to save another? Is it morally right to create `designer babies' and who should make those decisions? Is a 13 year old mature enough to decide whether she wants to be a donor? Are parent's rights over their child absolute? Jodi Picoult has handled these issues sensitively and has managed to produce a thoughtful, moving story that will have the reader gripped from start to finish. This is one of those books that you cannot put down, a real page turner and one I would recommend highly.
B00005JOFO|5.0|First of all, I am so relieved that I have finally seen this film after so much anticipation, and I was moved to tears as I had expected. It's been so long since I have been so taken by a romantic movie, and Brokeback Mountain is as beautiful and emotionally impacting as films like Happy Together(Tony Leung), Intimates(Carina Lau), and The English Patient(Ralph Fiennes). It's such a treat to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger under the meticulous direction of Ang Lee. I agree with Lee that this film is a beautiful love story and not a gay cowboy movie.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain uses the beautiful mountain landscape of Alberta as a stand in for the Wyoming mountains. It's the place where Jack(Gyllenhaal) and Ennis(Ledger) spent their first year in the mid '60s working together as cowboys tending the sheeps. The two lonesome cowboys clashed at first, but eventual became friends and secret lovers. Jack is the sexy and rebellious one, and Ennis is emotionally and sexually confused. At first, they didn't want to acknowledge their feelings for each other, until they were separated for four years, and started to miss each other. During those four years, they both got married and led a \\"normal life\\", and had kids. Ennis' wife Alma(Michelle Williams) eventually found out that he's cheating on her with Jack, but never actually confronted him until years later. Jack had been relocated to Texas since marrying the beautiful and wealthy Laureen(Anne Hathway).<br /><br />When Jack and Ennis were reunited, it reignited their old passion and lust for each other, and occasionally went up to Brokeback Mountain to have their secret romantic getaways while pretending to be on fishing trips. Jack's feeling for Ennis grew stronger gradually, and suggested to move away and live together. But Ennis has homophobia of his own and fear any possible alienation and condemnation, and just wanted to keep it a \\"once in a blue moon\\" deal. So time passes by, and twenty years later, they are both middle aged men, still going through the same old pattern. Jack becomes resentful towards Ennis, because he had wasted half of his life loving him and not having him entirely, even when he had already been divorced from Alma for years.<br /><br />This film features a scene stealing Michelle Williams. The scene when Alma saw Ennis kissing and hugging Jack outside her house was so funny and shocking. She was mesmerizing when she had her heart-to-heart confrontation with Ennis. Anne Hathway has less screentime and a less challenging role to work with, and she gets to wear different kinds of wigs. Her final scene when she breaks the tragic news to Ennis was her big moment. I enjoyed watching every scene between Jake and Heath. I actually like Jake's character more, because he knew what he wanted and was not afraid to love the man of his life. I was very moved by his final scene, which was kind of long, but the most dramatic between the two leads. I wished Jake had a few more stronger scenes to work with. It's Heath who actually got the most tear-jerking moments, and yes, his performance is compelling, and heartbreaking, especially the last fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Ang Lee had done a great job making this film visually stunning and emotionally powerful, even though the love scenes are rather low-key. The cinematography captures the most beautiful images of the mountains, sheeps, rivers, and lakes. The original score and theme song are quite memorable. This film is going to have a huge following of gay audiences, but it's also a must-see for the mainstream crowds, because it's truly the year's most unforgetable romantic movie!both middle aged men, still going through the same old pattern.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay has a style that they have been true to sence the begining. They have a look and attidude that is completly their own. Their style of music is amazing and has made them the superstars that they are. <br /> <br />Their latest album, X&Y, is what I would say their best album to date. They still use there lyrics to captivate and intertain people and that is why they continue to recieve great praise. Their sound is an earthy rock sound and they use many different background scenary to draw your attention to them. They don't need it though because the sound alone is enough to draw anyone to listen/buy their cds. <br /> <br />They are true to themselves and that is something that not many artist can say honestly. If they keep their look and style, they will be around to make many more succesful albums like X&Y.
B000002UAC|5.0|Steve appreciate your fine review of Meet the Beatles.  Agree with you that as an aging Beatle fan I wish we had the orginal US printing of this and other Beatle album.  What I did was take the CD's and create a mix of the songs as they orginally appeared in 1963/64/65.  I like you have listened to these albums so many times as a kid they are imprinted in my brain to be heard in a specific order.  Nor to hear \\"This Boy\\" as the  third song on Meet the Beatles puts me off.  I would doubt if there are many of us out there that would make this a good finanical project for a record company to rerelease these albums in their US format.  Just thought to write.  By the way have you seen the newly released Concert for Bangladesh\\" on DVD.   Just a joy to see after so many years.
B000002H97|4.0|Well the black album wasn't that bad of an album from metallica. For some people they say that this isn't the old metallica but some elements of the old metallica are still in here. It's not their heaviest album but it still has some good tunes. My friend of Misery is a song that is pretty good. Even Sad But True is another song that I can say is pretty heavy from the album. This is the album that put metallica into the mainstream and for some they soldout. But hey what band in music today hasn't sold out. Eventually your favorite band will and for Metallica, many fans just couldn't accept that.To me they didn't. I just think they just tried to do some diffrent stuff and explore more of their creative musical abilities. It's very diffrent from their previous work. But if your starting to become a Metallica fan I suggest starting off with this album and then hear the heavier stuff.
B00006879E|4.0|When Songs About Jane came along people had never heard of Maroon 5, but now that the cd has blown up into fame, everyone knows who the infectious band is. The album consists of many toe taping, and light hearted songs, with soul and meaning to each one. <br /> <br />Harder to breath, was the first time we saw the band and what a great energy they had. The song was very relatably to many people and everyone was soon singing along on the radio. The song has a more heavy underlying tone, but people still felt that it was the hit of the year. <br /> <br />This Love, the second track, was the real song that boosted the group. People loved the song due to it's great light and rythmic tone and style. <br /> <br />She Will be Loved, the 4th track, was the ultimate love anthem. The new softer side of the band gave us the idea that they could do anything and any style of music and they would still be a hit. <br /> <br />Sunday Morning, the 8th track, had us all lovin the guys even more. The upbeet tempo and classic soul of the song made people instantly fall in love with the song and made the band a bunch of superstars, that they still are today. <br /> <br />Their sound is much like that of Coldplays, but they have something in the way the song flows that makes it completly their own. <br />
B000BMSTMS|3.0|Well here you go a war between korn fans and this guy. Not that long ago it was fans that liked the black album that went after the same person. First off Pisser does make some good points. He didn't say anything about the fans just the band. If you don't say anything or mention his name he wouldn't keep talking smack about korn. Not everyone has to like Korn it's impossible.<br /><br />But To pisser just because they like korn that dosn't mean that they don't have a taste in real music. I'm pretty sure these people have heard of black sabbath( at least I hope). Are they the next sabbath or maiden? Hell No!! But for fans this is metal to them. I hate bizkit but that dosn't mean that I'm going to type a four paragraph essay of why I hate them. I can say it in one sentence. If your a Maiden fan then spread the good word about maiden or megadeth instead of always picking korn apart.<br /><br />And for korn fans hey it's cool that your standing up for your band. I just wrote a review on sabbath and some idiot said that they were posser metal(by the way pisser the Fu@ker said it on the paranoid section. Maybe you should tell him what real metal is all about). I had to defend sabbath man because I love sabbath and Ozzy.But that dosn't mean that I'm going to get all offensive about it. I respect all types of metal(except for Bizkit). Even if it is korn. I'm not much into them but I give them respect. Their keeping some type of metal alive and that's cool. I'm not here to start anything but it's time for people to start acting like grown ups. It's just music it's for the fans let the fans review the album. Munky maynot be Dimebag or Randy Rhoads but he does play the guitar pretty good. Jonathan maynot be Ozzy or Rob Halford but he dosn't sing that bad he's pretty good. And I heard this album and it's not that bad. But like I said I'm not starting anything I'm just making some points.

B000002KHH|5.0|First off to the guy that said this is posser metal, how in the hell can you call a band posser metal when their the ones that started metal. Don't be like some idiots that once said a few months back that Korn started metal. Now I respect Korn but come on they didn't even create nu metal. Man you need to get your history straight about how metal started. Anyway this is a good Black Sabbath album. Not as good as Bloody Sabbath but it's still a great album from one of the greatest bands of all time. Paranoid is one of the best songs from sabbath. Other good songs on the album is of course War Pigs and Iron Man. You don't have to like the band but you do have to respect the band for what they have done.
B000AGTPUU|2.0|This movie makes a big deal out of everything, from drinking hot chocolate to losing a train ticket.     Everything is so over dramatized. I guess they did this to make the film longer (out of a lack of available content to put in the movie) but there is no need to fill up a nearly 30 minute segment of the film over a stupid lost ticket. Another downside to the movie are the characters- they are pretty creepy looking for a Christmas children movie, especially the main character and that constant, annoying grin he keeps on his face.     I remember reading the book every year in elementary school- they would turn a section of the library into a train and we would read the book aloud- a great, imaginative story but a stupid, unimaginative movie.
B000000993|5.0|This album is a great tool album and I recommend it to anyone who likes metal or nu metal. Whether you be a korn fan or a black sabbath fan you won't regret buying this when you hear Maynard James Keenan sing. He's got a unique voice in metal today. You don't get that in metal today.When it comes to nu metal Chino Moreno and Keenan have the best voices. Thats why they did a song on the white pony album. But anyway sober and crawl away are the good songs on the album. When you hear tools music or A Perfect Circle it makes you to want to hear more.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|3 hour Christmas movies will probably be Peter Jackson's slot for as long as he gets a budget and camera into his hands, something the Jack Black character, Carl Denham, in Kong wants to do by shipping his unsuspecting crew and cast to the mystery Skull Island where he believes he will film the last place on earth that man has not been, kicking off a somewhat violent and horrific adventure that pushes its PG-13 limit to even shock adults, but in a fun sort of way, King Kong as Horror works, as it was meant to have been, bringing us a startling Skull Island incident, coupled with a daring rescue mission that turns into a quest for Kong, seeing this epic on the big screen is the reason why widescreen movies where invented, you will be hard pressed to recall a better thrill-seeker be it on DVD or in the movies in a long a time. Although Kong may seem a little akin to Jurassic Park 2: The Lost Word at times or dips into melodrama more than once to score one with the bleeding hearts in the audience, nowhere else will you see fight sequences that last for up to fifteen minutes, one after the other, as Jackson attempts to bring silent movies back into the fray, and does it ever so well, literally there is no dialogue as the artist uses the canvas to tell the story, you will be thanking him wholeheartedly for reintroducing us to what cinema was meant to be. Of course no one will be surprised by the ending, will still be eagerly awaiting the final reel, and what a final reel it is, special effects like you have not seen special effects before, Kong simply stomps its competition into the ground and then roars for more. Don't relegate your chance to see it now by waiting for home theatre. This is what Movie crowds are all about!
B00000FCBC|4.0|Just like any other metal band Metallica started out as a garage band. I'm not much into metallica's new stuff but this is actually pretty good. Alot of old and new songs that metallica covered. Some songs that Metallica cover are Queen's stone cold crazy, The Misfits Die, Die My Darling and they have a Mercyful Fate Melody that kicks ass. Some other pretty good songs are Sabra Cadabra, Over Kill, and Whiskey in the Jar. Good album from the band but not great. But it beats load and reload. Only Metallica can pull of an album like this and cover the songs well.
0060751967|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much and I'm looking forward to reading more of this authors books. It had a cute romance, not better than D.N. Simmons or Sherry Kenyon, but still pretty entertaining. I would recommend readind the Knights of the Darkness Chronicles for sure, great series!
B000002H6C|5.0|Well here you go. The And Justice For All album. This album is the last true heavy Metallica album we get from the band. Now the black album was good but it couldn't hold a candle to the justice album. The track One man that is dark and just pure metal. But some other good songs on the album are Blackend, Harvester of Sorrow, and And Justice For All.If you want to hear a classic album from metallica than I hear this one or anything else before that. This is some of their best work and some of the most heaviest of their work.
1401206905|5.0|Since Frank Miller wrote and illustrated the ultimate final Batman story in \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" great attention was paid when he penned a new version of the first Batman story with \\"Batman: Year One,\\" leaving the artistic duties to David Mazzucchelli (with Richmond Lewis painting the colors).  Miller came up with several great moments in \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" most notably when the Joker snaps his own neck, but the part that stood out for me was when Batman explains to Superman the different lessons they learned from the example of their respective parents.  Stephen King once said you were either a Batman person or a Superman person, and Miller came up with a nice way of capturing their inherently oppositional natures.  The four issues of \\"Batman\\" (#404-407) that made up this mini-series are not part of the constant debate as to the greatest graphic novel of all time (still \\"Watchmen\\" for me), but all things considered I think \\"Batman: Year One\\" is the better story.<br /><br />If \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" comes down to Batman versus Superman and the world's finest realizing they must be on opposite sides, then \\"Batman: Year One\\" from start to finish is about Batman and Jim Gordon coming to the realization that they need each other.  Miller and Mazzucchelli develop stories that are not really parallel, but which are heading to the same end point.  Gordon arrives in Gotham City for the first time by train while Bruce Wayne flies back home after twelve years abroad, each thinking they should have picked the other mode of transportation.  Goron is a cop and Wayne wants to be a vigilante, Gordon is married with a pregnant wife and Wayne's only real relationship is with Alfred, and Gordon is learning how things work in Gotham City while Wayne is simply waiting for the missing piece, the one thing he can use to make the criminals afraid of him.<br /><br />Miller and Mazzucchelli tells the story in four acts.  In this deluxe edition Chapter One, \\"Who I Am, How I Come to Be,\\" is captioned: \\"He will become the greatest crimefighter the world has ever known...It won't be easy.\\"  The point is to get to the pivotal moment when Bruce Wayne declares \\"I shall become a bat,\\" but leading up to it having Wayne experiencing familiar that put his mission in doubt.  Meanwhile, Gordon shows that he will not submit to the corrupt or violence inherent in the system in Gotham City.  His final line in the story is equally importan when he thanks bad cop Flass by saying, \\"You've shown me what it takes to be a cop in Gotham City.\\"<br /><br />\\"Chatper Two: War is Declared,\\" notes: \\"He had trained and planned and waited eighteen years.  He think's he's ready...\\"  The implication is that he is not and there is a key scene when Batman appears in costume and stands there on a balcony holding on to a fifteen year old burglar while a couple of others whale on him because he refuses to be a killer.  Batman and Gordon cross paths for the first time, and the lieutenant is told to bring in the vigilante or else.  But before Gordon can do that, the commissioner decides to fire bomb the slum building that Batman is hiding in.<br /><br />\\"Chapter Three: Black Down\\" is where the power shifts: \\"They've got him CORNERED.  They've got him OUTNUMBERED.  They've got him TRAPPED.  They're in TROUBLE...\\"  Significantly, Gordon has been ordered to stay out of it while the Gotham City P.D. tries to take Batman, who has clearly become a hero to the common people.  But the character development of Gordon in this chapter is more important, because he comes to have reason to hate himself equally in his professional and personal life.  By the end of this one Gordon has framed the equation: Batman is a criminal and he is a cop, but a cop in a city where the mayor and commissioner use cops as hired killers and the criminal saves an old woman, a cat, and pays for a suit he has technically stolen.  However, what is key is that Bruce Wayne has already come to the conclusion that he needs an ally and an inside man.  That is to say, he needs Jim Gordon on his side.<br /><br />\\"Chapter Four: Friend in Need,\\" declares \\"He's out to clean up a city that likes being dirty.  He can't do it alone.\\"  The question is simply what will be the event that brings Batman and Jim Gordon together.  Miller and Mazzucchelli come up with something that is at the nexus of several of the key subplots that have been developed in the story, and although Selina does don a Catwoman costume for the first time, that fact that there the story avoids villains in costume until a telling bit of foreshadowing in the final panel helps keep the emphasis on Batman being a new idea as far as the denizens of Gotham City are concerned.<br /><br />In the back of the deluxe edition you will find Mazzucchelli's four-page comic book afterward, promotional and early drawings, marked-ed up copies of Miller's script paired with rough layouts, and looks at the final results.  All told there is over 40-pages of such sketches and art in the back of the book.  Denny O'Neil writes the introduction and Miller has a postscript of sorts at the end, so there are plenty of reasons to have this even if you already have the original four issues of \\"Batman\\" salted away in your comic book collection.sion that he needs an ally and an inside man.

B000002H2H|5.0|Man I love this Metallica cd. Ride the lightning and justice for all are my favorite metallica albums. This one they speeded up more, gave heavier riffs and amazing solos. It's more darker than Kill Em' All and in my opinion more better. Some of the stand out tracks on the album are Fade to Black, Creeping Death, and For Whom the Bell Tolls. You have to give it up for metallica for making one of the best metal albums and giving us all something to headbang to. If your into metal you won't regret buying this. It's that good. Maybe Metallica would put out another album that sounds like this.
0142004235|5.0|I try to read this book every 5 years or so. I always find something more that I appreciate about the stories of the characters. This is a timeless classic that I recommend to many people.
0812975219|5.0|What are some of the book's good points ?    It communicates our deep flaws as decision-makers in a thoughtful and humane manner.    It amusingly discusses `Risk Managers' as being clueless concerning randomness.    The story of `Solon' is priceless in that it communicates true foundations for people who want to be risk managers regardless of its proximity to their business cards.    Wittgenstein's Ruler story will change the way you think about econometrics, if you ever thought about it at all.    It succinctly communicates the essence of why Karl Popper is worth understanding  and does the same for simulation using the Russian roulette story.    It inspired at least one entrepreneur.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens' \\"Illinois\\" is undoubtedly this years biggest and bravest work. With 22 tracks (12 of them being actual songs) and paragraph long song titles, Sufjan steers clear of the conventional structure of an album and might I say, thank God!  Music today is so schematic and prefabricated. It's refreshing to listen to something unique, playful, and even quirky. The lyrics on \\"Illinois\\" could easily tilt some heads and make you say, \\"What the hell is he talking about?\\" Still, even with his odd approach to songwriting, it's obvious that he puts a lot of love into them all. For example, \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr. is quite possibly the most heartbreaking song I've heard all year. It's extremely haunting and lyrically beautiful in describing this man and what he did. Yet, sympathy for a serial killer is evidently expressed and you understand why.   At times though the album comes across as some sort of a history lesson. Names like Abraham Lincoln, Frank Loyd Wright, Nicolas Park, Carl Sandburg, and many other historical figures are dropped into songs without warning. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't kill the song at all. If anything it reminds me of school house rock (that's a compliment) but much better and complex of course.   I could go on and on about how wonderful this album is but that would take way too long. If one were to ask me what this album sounds like, I would have to say that it's sounds like an orchastrated, broadway-esque, folk driven with a dash of bluesy country-ish music with songs that mention everything from UFOs to mass murderers to superman to whatever happened in Illinios! I can't wait until he hits Texas.
B00008EY9G|1.0|Without giving away too much, this movie is both figuratively and literally a great gigantic migraine headache. Headaches of any kind have never been enjoyable. This one is no exception. <br /> <br />If it weren't for John Cusack and Amanda Peet, they would have never been able to produce this movie with the absolutely non-plot storyline. Why does Cusack even agree to star in such a dumb movie? He has talent, as well as Peet - at least I think so.
B00005JLF5|3.0|Deep Space Nine ranks as my 2nd favorite Star Trek series, but I had forgotten how boring this first season could be.  Of course, it's not unusual for the first season or two of a new Star Trek series to really suck -- they've all been like that.  This first season of DS9 was a challenge to watch because the writing was mediocre, the cast didn't really seem to mesh well, and the acting was sub-par at best (except for Avery Brooks who over-acted in the extreme).  Fortunately, season two on forward was great.  There were many good things about this series, and they begin with this first season:  the creation and development of the Bajoran race was great and interesting, the character of Odo was their best and one of the more original (even better later on), the further development of the Ferengi race was fun, and I always liked the development of Jadzia Dax's character (my favorite character).  In fact, one of the best episodes of this season was \\"Dax,\\" in which the producers handled the conundrum of a joined race and the actions of previous hosts.  This is certainly not the best season of this series, but you have to start here to see how it all began.

The night time in Havana is pretty cool not to mention the dirty dancing. The only thing I did not understand is why they did not include the deleted scene with Hyman Roth.  Pat Swayze drops by after he was done dancing and getting a face lift to eat some cake with Hyman Roth.  Pretty neat scene really.
020530902X|5.0|If you write, you need this book.<br /><br />This is the most highly concentrated package of common sense and clear exposition I have ever seen. Twenty two brief rules, each with examples and explanation, state the basics of clear and unaffected writing. The authors acknowledge that rules can be broken, but warn you against breaking them casually or frequently. These rules are for your reader's benefit, to organize your ideas so the reader can grasp them quickly and, more important, correctly. The authors also make it easy to read and reread these rules - they are compactly presented in just 33 pages.<br /><br />The last chapter adds another 21 rules on style. This section may baffle or offend someone just starting in creative writing. Young artists in all media seem determined to create their style, before they find much of anything to say. Wrong!

0790729407|5.0|\\"Michael Collins\\" was unfortunately, a flash in the pan of a theatre movie, at least in America it was!..And that is in the main, enormously regrettable, because it's a king size story, about a king size character, Michael Collins, the founder of the Irish Republic Army..The big fellow, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, as chief architect of murder and mayhem, single-handedly brought the British Empire to the bargaining table, through some \\"hard ball\\" tactics, to at least consider the possibilty that Ireland might become something more than just an unwanted, red-headed stepchild to England!..Collins was a natural born rebel rouser, and evoked the ethos of the typical Irishman, could sing, entertain, spin a good yarn, or shoot you in cold blood, depending upon your politics..Collins organized the precursor to the Irish Republic Army, and carried a bounty of 10,000 pounds on his head, dead or alive..The bad news for the Crown was, there were no legible, recent photos of Collins in stock, meaning Collins for a time, manuevered in secret, as a ghost, or a sphinx..Politics as everyone knows, is a blood-sport, and betrayal from within is always inevitable..And Collins' chief and chief rival was Eamon de Lavera, the guarded, somewhat jealous, intellectual President of the Republic of Ireland..de Lavera always sent Michael and his boys, the twelve apostles, out to do the tasteless dirty work, that de Lavera couldn't stomach himself..Collins' greatness and stature emanated from his passionate belief in his cause, and was probably outwitted by de Lavera in the end, much like Sonny Corleone was outsmarted in \\"The Godfather,\\" done in by excessive passion!..And \\"Michael Collins\\" the movie, is very much the gangster's tale, a grandiose, sweeping epic with mega-sets, and rich, period costuming..Neil Jordan, the director of \\"Michael Collins\\" deserves enormous credit for coordinating such an ambitious project, and making it succeed on so many levels..The dialogue and mood of \\"Michael Collins\\" is intense, and Kubrick in scope..Jordan deserves more credit for his exhaustive efforts in this feature than for any of his other earlier, more well known works..By all means, rent or purchase \\"Michael Collins\\", you will be entertained and educated, but moreso transported to the time and place of this historically relevant saga!

B00005YEAP|5.0|My favourite Pain of Salvation album, also my favourite album of all time. Remedy Lane is dark, emotive, beautiful, dealing with subjects such as suicide, love, despair, miscarriage, and a trip into a painful past. <br /> <br />Why is it my favourite? First, the production is great. No more muddy tones such as in Perfect Element I. Second, the humanity of the subjects clicks with me very well. Don't get me wrong. 'Be' is good as a philosophical piece, but Remedy Lane's lyrical subjects, music strikes the deeper (and deepest chord) compared to all of their other albums. <br /> <br />Let me touch on Gildenlow. Amazing singer, truly unique, and the only singer I have ever heard to truly use his voice as an instrument. The weird sounds he makes, as mentioned by another reviewer, just enhances Remedy Lane for me. He is on top form here, and backed by an excellent vocalist with complex, deep and stirring music - How could Remedy Lane be anything short of a masterpiece? <br /> <br />The Japanese bonus track, Thorn Clown, is a thematically similar album, and fits well with Remedy Lane. Is it worth the extra money? I personally don't think so, but its your decision.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|King Kong cements Peter Jackson as our generation's premiere maker of fantasy films. We all know the story of King Kong, especially the infamous final scene, but this film kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The rewrite of the story incorporates era specific dialogue and scenes and events left out of the original. It manages to stay faithful to the original intent, while modernizing it at the same time. The special effects are absolutely fantastic. This movie is a must see and an instant classic.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|Let me ask one question.  How could Peter Jackson go from making three of the greatest films of all time to making this Hollywood stink trash?  The only film this year that I have seen that is worse than this is Serenity.  And Peter, just for the record, all your movies do not have to be three hours in length anymore.  You could have told this story in ninty minutes.    The plot takes over one hour to get to the island.  This dribble of cheesy dialouge and bad acting by all three of the leads is just sad.  When we finally get to the island it takes another twenty minutes to see Kong.      Then the movie was supposed to get exciting.  But Peter Jackson's sights dominate the film.  He does scence between Naomi Watts and Kong that go on for minutes that only should be brief seconds. And even the films numerous action sequences just dragged on longer than needed.     And Peter Jackson tried to overkill us with the visual effects.  And as he overkilled us with these, he must have overbudgeted, because none of the film's visual and special effects are convincing.    Finally, we see Kong on Ice.  Literally!  Top it all of with Jack Black's absurtly idiotic closing line, the film ends on a sour note.    I once heard someone mutter at the trailer of this film, \\"We had to wait for the Hobbit for this?!\\"  Yes, Lord of the Rings fans, we do.  Do what I would do.  Pay the seven to ten dollars on the much superior Chronicles of Narnia.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a powerful a movie that takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller-coaster ride. It is a tragic romance in the vain of Romeo and Juliet, or is that Romeo and Romeo. Take out the petty, feuding Montagues and Capulets and substitute the vicious stereotypes of 1960's Middle America, complete with gay bashing, homophobia, and self-doubt. This movie is shocking commentary on how far we have come and, if you want to know how far we still have to go, just look to the movie's R rating. There is nothing in this movie that deserves the R rating. It is given that rating solely for the reason that the two main characters are both males. There is very little sex and nothing particularly graphic. It is simply a love story. It is sad that our society is so quick to show children men killing each other, yet so hesitant to show them falling in love.
0425173895|5.0|We adore a surprise, and Agatha Christie \\"The First Lady of Murder\\" obliges.  The best-selling fiction writer of all time, (outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare), takes us to the quintessential British village of King's Abbot for a mystery that keeps the reader guessing right up to the end.<br /><br />Miss Christie's detective hero, Hercule Poirot, is a displaced person from the Great War.  The eccentric Belgian detective shows all of his endearing quirks in this tale that sent the world of letters into paroxysms of apoplexy.  This was Miss Christie's sixth book and the third to feature Poirot, who in his own humble opinion, is the world's greatest detective, and who are we to argue?<br /><br />Poirot's egg-shaped head is filled with \\"little grey cells\\" that he uses to solve the crime, the murder of Roger Ackroyd, the squire of Fernly Park.  Poirot is assisted in his detecting by Dr. Sheppard, who takes the place of Poirot's more-familiar sidekick, Hastings - now down Argentine way.  Incidentally, Dr. Sheppard's sister Caroline served as the model for Agatha's snoop/sleuth, Miss Marple.<br /><br />Rules, it seems, are made to be tweaked as often as Poirot's mustache, and Miss Christie tweaks one of the rules of the mystery genre, herein, writing so deftly that we love her for it.  The plot's devilish twist had been suggested to Agatha by either Lord Mountbatten or her brother-in-law, or both.  At the time of its publication, she had all of her peers wishing that they had done it first.<br /><br />In this book, as elsewhere, Miss Christie will have you suspecting everyone before you are done -- everyone EXCEPT the culprit.  What a gem, treasure and joy this bit of detecting is.  Having stood the test of time, it deserves the praise and the attention of succeeding generations.<br /><br />Read it and prepare to be bowled over!<br /><br />There are plenty more whodunits to sample from Agatha Christie's pen, some featuring Poirot, some featuring her archetypical nosey parker detective, Miss Jane Marple.  Others feature a detecting couple (Tuppence and Tommy).  And then there are the wonderful Ariadne Oliver -- more than loosely based on Miss Christie herself, and Mr. Satterthwaite, an elf-like old man who looks on life and sees things that others miss, forever going to country house parties where all around him it rains murder and mayhem.  He is, of course, based on the author, Henry James. Lesser lights, Harley Quin and Parker Pyne round out the rather remarkable detective creations of Miss C.Others feature a detecting couple (Tuppence and Tommy).

B000B8IA2G|5.0|As Rodney utters when Sheppard becomes smitten by the lovely guest star, Leonor Varela in the episode Sanctuary.  This isn't just to poke fun at another Sci-Fi institution, as the writers must clearly see the similarities to that popular franchise.  While the show is a spin-off of Stargate SG-1, it is vastly different, and in my opinion, much closer to a Star Trek series than a parallel to SG-1.   <br /> <br />The one main similarity the show maintains with SG-1 is that these are modern day, Earth citizens getting into these futuristic, sci-fi adventures.  This aspect makes it very accesible to even the casual sci-fi viewer, as they can easily relate to the main characters, rather than have to rely to much on imagination and future machinations.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love SG-1, but one aspect of the show that seems to weigh it down a bit are a lot of the military base scenes on Earth, with the dull board rooms and office scenery.  Not that I mind non-action sequences, but I think the backgrounds are rather unappealing.  There is nothing like that on Atlantis, as we have new \\"Ancient\\" scenery galore on this mystical cityscape.  <br /> <br />Out of the 20 episodes on this DVD, not one is a dud.  I enjoyed every one, and while a few were somewhat boring, the performances and the building storyline of the season kept my interest rather well.  The first real episode was a slower one, and almost got me thinking that nothing was going to be as good as the stunning pilot, but then I was hit with the incredible tension of the episode Thirty Eight Minutes.  Sheppard and crew are stuck in the Stargate with half the Jumper in and half out, and Sheppard has a life sucking spider on his neck.  This one was excellent. <br /> <br />More good episodes abound, including the highlight of disc 2, Childhood's End.  It's a storyline that's been played out in sci-fi dozens of times before (ritual suicide at a young age) but this one is done well, with particularly good performancesby the guest actors.  In the last episode on Disc 2, we meet the only other real enemy of the Atlanteans other than the Wraith, the Genii, led by a familiar face in sci fi: Colm Meaney.  We get more of the Genii in season 1, including the two part story arc The Storm and the Eye, but Colm Meaney's character gives way to an equally talented villain, Robert Davi. <br /> <br />Disc 4 has two great episodes in Before I Sleep and The Brotherhood.  The former being a dual role for Torri Higginson, playing her older self, and she gives a powerful performance in the older role, almost better than the way she plays the normal Weir!!  No, I like Dr. Weir, I just think she hates being talked out of her orders by Sheppard and comes off as bitter.  In fact, the reason I gave Atlantis a try, was because I liked her performance as Weir in the Season 8 opener of SG-1.  She was much better than the actress who played Weir at the end of SG-1's Season 7.  We also get a neat, Indiana Jones, treasure hunt type episode in the form of Brotherhood, as they have to find where the 15 Brothers hid the ZPM using all sorts of clues and stones left behind, all the while with the dreaded Genii on their trail. <br /> <br />We end the season with the build up of the dreaded Wraith heading to Atlantis, wanting to use it to gain access to the wormhole back to Earth.  I like the Wraith as an villain race, and think they were used just about the right amount through the first season.   <br /> <br />Overall, I think season 1 was an excellent first season, and one of the best for any sci-fi show.  While I haven't seen any of Season 2 yet, I have seen and read about a lot of changes including 2 new cast members, and the departing of Lt. Ford.  I am not sure why this was done so early in the show, but tinkering with something that seemed so good, may be a mistake.  Not many successful shows have a drastic change at the end of the first year.  Most are consistent for the first few years: just look at SG-1,which went 5 seasons before the first main cast change. <br /> <br />Back to the Star Trek similarities.  Let's see, you have a macho leading man, who enjoys romancing alien priestesses (John/James T.), a stubborn doctor (McKay/McCoy), a Scottish crew member (Carson/Scotty), a non-Earthling lead crew member (Tayla/Spock), a solid action man (Ford/Sulu), and a setting that takes them to alien worlds (Atlantis/Enterprise).  In Trek they traveled by ship, where here they travel by wormhole. <br /> <br />Whatever the similarites to SG-1 or Star Trek, I enjoyed every bit of this new sci-fi show.  The cast, storyline, and setting are all superb.  There is lots of good sci-fi entertainment that can come out of this, let's hope it doesn't go downhill with season 2. <br /> <br />One last note, there is absolutely no reason why there shouldn't be chapter stops throughout every episode.  This is very annoying.  I've bought half hour kids' DVD's that have a dozen chapters in them!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|First off, I never saw the original. So, I don't know how it is compared to that but it's probably better. After all, it's very hard to be better than this movie. It is the best of the year, and is extremely entertaining even though it's 3hr10min.  <br />Already, I had to like this movie because of Naomi Watts, my favorite actress. As for Peter Jackson, in all honesty, I didn't like the Lord of the Rings. This movie blows them away.  <br />The ending of the movie at first made me mad but it made the movie very tragic and sad. Yet, I would have preferred a happier ending.  <br />The movie is set in the Great Depression with Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a gorgeous actress put out on the street. A movie producer (Jack Black) offers her the chance of a lifetime to star in his new movie written by her idol, a screewriter played by Adrien Brody. They go onto a huge boat and sail off to film the movie. They land on an island called Skull Island where they have an encounter with bizarre and violent natives. Then they meet the Dinosaurs, the insects and King Kong. The parts on the island are the best, absolutely splendid. The action is nonstop and the special effects are brilliant. The humans struggle to survive and have huge gun fights against dinosaurs and crazy insects. Meanwhile Ann is swooped up by Kong, and they form a bond as he saves her from countless dinosaurs and insects. They are so sweet together and it made me feel like saying a[...] But the best parts are Kong just beating the crap out of the other dinosaurs. The fights are insane and frickin' sweet. But then, Kong is captured and brought back to New York where he is commercialized and peeved off. He escapes and goes off with Ann where their love is shown. But then comes the end, and I was trully very depressed.  <br /> <br />Kong was AMAZINGLY made and made Aslan look like nothing. His facial expressions at the end made me cry inside as you could see his pain. You knew how he felt at all times. He laughed, cried,and shouted in pain. I became attached to him and the end destroyed me inside. I trully would have preferred a happy ending.  <br />The acting is good, but Adrien Brody's nose always got in the way. Jack Black was spledid and Naomi Watts was dazzling. But Kong stole the show by far. He was so real it's scary.  <br />The action is UNBELIEVABLE and wonderfully made. Kong basically does WWF wrestling on the other dinosaurs and it is just awesome. Heck, even the humans have tons of guns and have gigantic fights with nasty insects and huge dinosaurs. So the action is some of the best I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />The movie in the end is a love story on steroids. It's sweet, sad, awesome, etc.. The ice skating part is so sweet!  <br />You will get so attaced to the big ape that the end will completely destroy you and beg for a happy one. So trully, I thought the ending was pointless and I would have redone it. The final scene on the Empire State building could have seriously been trimmed down and it made me think: are the plane pilots retarded? They're nearly killing Anne! <br /> <br />King Kong is the best movie of the year, a pulse pounding drama that's got it all. It goes back very quickly so don't be worried about the length.  <br />The action is AWESOME, the laughs are there and the drama is so very sad. King Kong is the movie I've been wating for..for a very long time. It's a great ride, a sad ride, a must see movie that I will buy on DVD opening day.  <br />SEE IT IN THE THEATER! THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ROCK! <br />
B00004SZWE|4.0|Not only is this a great concept album by Stevie, it's also his best effort and it also stands the test of time to emerge as one of the best albums of all time.  As they say, \\"the cream always rises to the top\\" and this is surely the case for this album.  The version I have is actually made in the EU although I'm guessing the reason it has been described here as a limited edition is because of the fact that it comes in a digipak format with an excellent 28-page (not counting the covers)booklet with all the lyrics.  I'm not sure if this U.S. version is identical to the one that I have but if it is, you are in for a treat as the sound quality is good due to the remastering job they did although not great which is understandable given the state of the 1976 original master and so some tracks have higher volume levels than others.  However, the tracks are things of beauty and stand the test of time.  Although there are \\"single\\" material in here, the only way to truly appreciate this work of art is to listen to the whole thing at one go.  For the record, the \\"single\\" stuff that still sound good today are: \\"Sir Duke\\" and \\"Isn't She Lovely\\".  The other standout tracks must be \\"Pastime Paradise\\" later ripped off to great effect for the \\"Dangerous Minds\\" soundtrack \\"Gangster's Paradise\\" and \\"Black Man\\" is a fantastic study in slap bass that would make Mark King of Level 42 proud.  There is also a track on disc two that sounds a lot like Lionel Ritchie's \\"All Night Long.\\"  It's obvious that many, many artistes have been inspired over the years by this album and I sure many, many more will be over the decades to come.  Very highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|How does she manage to do it over and over again?! Madonna has succeeded yet again in giving us a funky dancy album. Always a leader and never a follower, you can bet that 70s/80s music will be remixed even more than before.   I must admit that when I heard Hung Up (the first song on the album) I was highly irritated, as I couldn't believe yet another song by ABBA (Gimme, Gimme, Gimme) had been sampled. Ofcourse, the song then grew on me, and I think it's the second best song on Confessions....  Leading to the best song in my opinion- Isaac. A very touching, spiritual song that shows off Madonna's talent- remember Ray of Light? It definitely reflects her Kabbala/yoga/spiritual journey.  Hats off to her tribute to her husband Guy: Push me. Couldn't be clearer what she thinks of Guy. Although it's funny how Guy hated this album!    Correct me if I'm wrong, but Madonna also sounds a bit like Donna Summer on Future Lovers. And \\"I love New York\\"- is probably an indirect jibe to Texans (and Bush?)     The songs above are my favourites, but the whole album has been cleverly done- all the songs beautifully blend into each other, making it as though you have your own DJ (so just get your dance floor and disco ball!) Brilliant album, great stocking stuffer, and a good stress buster. Pooh to the people who couldn't appreciate this album, or the fact that Madonna is not afraid to reinvent and set a trend.
B00006RAKP|5.0|If you are looking at possessing the best this guy has done, this is the best version to own.  Not only does this span from the very beginning to the present time, it's also been very well remastered for a great sound and it comes in a very cool digipak cardboard packaging with a nifty booklet to boot.  The only downer for me is that two of my favourite tracks, \\"Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Empty Garden\\" are missing but I guess that's the price you pay when you have to squeeze tracks (34 of them) on 2 discs.  I personally prefer his work up to \\"Sad Songs\\" and so I didn't care too much for the tracks after Track 5 on disc 2 but to be fair, all the tracks are fairly representative of Elton's career to date.  Recommended if you want the best of Elton and not want to get all the albums.
B000002KCV|5.0|Comes A Time by Neil Young is one of his all time best. Few records in Neils cannon are better then this one. Every song flows perfectly into the next, well almost every song. The lyricism is bright and in someplaces uplifting. The acousitc musician ship is amazing. Neil's backing band is right on que and takes this already amazing work of music to a whole nother level with just a few beats of the drum and some simple plucks of the bass. For Comes A Time, think, the Harvest album, but better and the complete opposite of themes. Harvest was dark and self wollowing in some places, while this whole album is bright and a whole hell of a lot happier... which makes for a better album in this case.<br /><br />While Harvest was good and the message felt more personnal, Comes A Time is much better. The recording for one thing is amazing compared to the other. Everything is Crytal clear and loud in your speakers which makes for a nice listening experince.<br /><br />There are not that many song on the album that went on to become classics or get regular play on te radio but for Neil fans almost every song on the album is a classic. 'Piece Of Mind' 'Human Highway' and 'Goin Back' are all Neil staples and are concidered by many to be three of his best songs. The rest of the songs are astounding as well.<br /><br />The one thing that somewhat threw me about this album was 'Motorcycle Mama.' Its a great song and has killer guitar but it doesnt fit in with the album. If he would have put it on American Stars N' Bars it would have fit better. But he put it on here because he thought that it would make the B-side of the album stronger. Well the B-side was already plenty strong, unike Harvest where 'Alabama' was needed. It doesnt take anything away from the album but I just feel it is slightly out of place. But it does show that Neil cant go to long with out really rockin' out! I think thats a good thing.<br /><br />So in the end Comes A Time is a really good album, maybe even Neil Youngs all time best. One things for sure there comes a time when everyone should own this album.n Neil Youngs all time best. One things for sure there comes a time when everyone should own this album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|as the saying 'if I have to explain, you wouldn't understand\\" goes, so does the understanding of this album.  It's been many years since it was released and I still regard it a milestone.  This is radiohead before they went off the deep-end and got all \\"deconstruction\\"-al (read: weird).  Getting to the point, this is an album that 15 years ago foresaw the encroachment of technology on our daily lives. It is a true classic. <br />While recent reviewers may have dragged this album to less than a 5, their punishment is buying the latest pop album.  It's funny how people with no artistic sensibilities are the first to cling to the status quo and cry \\"zep is the best, zep is the best\\", like raymond wanting to watch judge Wapner. <br />anyway, to those who are considering taking the plunge and are willing to give more than 1 listen in order to understand its profound sensibilities (you know who you are) - buy this album. <br />i highly recommend it - and, chances are, i know music better than you do/ ;) <br />ps- type a's beware, go listen to boston or diamond dave, or something like ac/dc..
B000002UD1|4.0|Not one of John Lennons biggest selling albums, Mind Games is still one of his better albums. Coming out right after Sometime In New York City its no wonder it didnt sell that well. No one expected much after that release. Mind Games was probabley Johns Most solid album to this point and it probabley was his best recorded as well. Mind Games is full of sentamental, social political, rock and roll lyrics, some of which are his all time best. this is more laid back then John Lennons other albums, nothing really to rockin' but thats ok because he makes it work and he does it well, very well in fact.<br /><br />Mind Games is often overlooked because of its lack of hit singles. The only hit single was the opener and title track, 'Mind Games.' Even it didnt become a very big hit. Even though its a really nice song with reall good lyrics it isnt one of my favorites in fact it and 'Nutopian International Anthem' or NIA are my least favorite songs on the album.<br /><br />With as good as this album is its not one of my favorite John Lennon albums. It's two laid back for me. The ballads out weigh the rockers and I dont like that. I love John Lennon for when he picks up a guitar and rocks out best. I love all his music but thats my favorite side of him, here you mainly just get him and the piano which he is good at and which I still like but most people cant sit and listen to that all the time, because its not that exciting.<br /><br />'Meat City' is the song that closes the album, and in my openion its the best song on the album. Lennon picks up the guitar and rocks out. It reminds me why I love John Lennon and why so many where influenced by him. This song also reminds me why this isnt one of my favorite John Lennon albums. He plays very little guitar on this record. I love it when he plays guitar he is a very good player. Sometimes his playing even rivals the playing of his Beatle brother George Harrison who is concidered by players to be one of the all time best.<br /><br />So to wrap things up this is a very good album, not John best but still a very good album. Its a little weak in some places but the good does out weigh the bad. I do think he could have done better but if he was happy with it when he released it then I guess thats all that matters in the end./> <br />So to wrap things up this is a very good album, not John best but still a very good album. Its a little weak in some places but the good does out weigh the bad. I do think he could have done better but if he was happy with it when he released it then I guess thats all that matters in the end.

B00008G9AQ|5.0|Just like all of the other Harry Potter books and movies, this one is wonderful as well.  And yes of course this is fantasy, not at all like real magick, its not suppose to be. If you don't have an imagination, then you have nothing.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|madonna has been an icon for more than 20 years. she was inducted last year in the music hall of fame with elvis, beatles, queen and u2. you can like her or not, but that's it. i do not understand why some people say \\"it's just pop\\" or \\"dance sucks\\". i don't like metal music, but i respect it though - and respect its listeners. it's simply amazing how an artist who's been in the business for such a long time, is still so wonderfully innovative. listen to the other \\"old glories\\" from the 70s or 80s. most of them have become incredibly boring or seem to have lost their inspiration. even the u2, george michael or sting (that i respect sooooo much) seem they don't have anything to say anymore. not to talk about crappy people like mariah carey - the best they can do is hiring a sort of ghetto rapper and let him do the job (he raps all the time - she shouts and moans on the background). though, i RESPECT mariah's fans, since i do believe they are somewhat (to me, inexplicably, sorry) inspired by her. ok, madonna hasn't got mariah's voice, but music, celebrity, durability, making great songs is not only about having great voices. see the beatles, elvis. how many singers were/are much better than them, technically speaking? why, a lot! still, they're there and will be there forever.  <br />confessions on a dancefloor is an amazing album. some songs are quite commercial, maybe, but incredibly catchy and infectious - is there something wrong with that in music?  others need to be listened to more than a couple of times to be fully appreciated.  <br />i don't think it makes so much sense to say what the best songs are to me, as it comes to personal feelings and opinions. isaac is very emotional and in some way resembles frozen. hung up is undoubtedly catchy, as into the groove was 20 years ago. i love new york has a slight rock taste.  <br />what's special about this album is that it's not conventional, it's not \\"obvious\\". everytime you listen to it, you notice a new sound, anew vocal effect, a new layer.  <br />well, useless to say, you need to turn your cd player up, that's the only way to really enjoy this new surprising madonna cd.  <br />respect.
B0000025F7|4.0|For anyone who ever wondered what a classic album sounds like, \\"Off the Wall\\" is the epitome. I love this CD. It truly has its own sound, this sound is innovate and original. Michael's voice is pure on this album, not as much trembling as he does nowadays. This album is one of the many reasons why Michael Joseph Jackson has been named the King of Pop.  <br />This album had a string of hits which were \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Working Day and Night\\", \\"She's Out of My Life\\" and \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\". \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\" was a huge success. This was Michael's first single from this album. It was a party starter, and music listeners loved hearing it on the radio. This song is simply about dancing, something Michael is known for doing oh so well. \\"Rock With You\\" showed us a more romantic, toned down Michael. This song was also an instant success. He did a really nice job vocally. Everything about this song is on point. The chorus is catchy, the production is simple but it truly works, and the lyrics are memorable as well. I really love \\"I Can't Help It\\". The lyrics are pretty deep, and Michael shows much emotion while penning this tune. This is my personal album highlight. Another notable is \\"Girlfriend\\". This song doesn't have a deep meaning, or even that great of a production, but it's just, well, cute.  <br />Fillers are complete absent on this album. It's full of quality songs produced by the man, Quincy Jones. I highly recommend this album to ANY MUSIC LISTENER!  <br /> <br />Mikeisha's Top 5  <br />1. Off the Wall  <br />2. I Can't Help It  <br />3. Rock With You  <br />4. Burn this Disco Out  <br />5. It's the Falling in Love  <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Serinity\\" has shown the public what die hard Joss Whedon fans have known for years: the man is a genius when it comes to characterization, story, and outright excitement.  He sets the bar higher for all of us writers.  He has shown how truly outstanding movies and television can be.<br /><br />I saw \\"Serenity\\" on opening night and was engrosed.  Returning to these very three dimensional characters was of course exciting.  One thing that truly impressed me was how the movie was written to be easily understood by newcomers to the verse, and to offer so much to existing fans.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" is to 2005 as \\"Star Wars\\" was to 1977.  SEE IT.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|I saw a few of the original MTV Aeon Flux cartoons and the movie is far from true to the series....so if you're looking for that don't go.   <br />    I'm quite surprised to see that some people found this movie intellectually stimulating.  Personally, I thought the plot was lame at best.  To echo another reviewer...enough of the d@#mn clones already!  Find another plot device people!!   <br />    If you want some real acting and better martial arts, watch Serenity instead.  It had a good mix of humor, drama and kick-butt martial arts.  I must disagree with previous reviewers that the plot was too complex either in this movie or in Serenity.... I found both plots to be fairly simplistic.  I would consider the Matrix series convoluted.  <br />    If you're into eye candy (I don't mind a little every now and then) as soon as this comes out on DVD or PPV check it out.  Its visually fascinating and has an interesting view of what future technology might be like.  The animation is quite good and so are the stunts.  The martial arts were not so hot.  The scenes are so fast you really aren't sure what happened. <br /> <br />  Overall, think Laura Croft Tomb Raider in a Sci Fi setting.  <br />     <br /> <br />PS Don't worry, after watching it you won't be a bit less American!  (Sly jab at a previous reviewer...sorry coudn't help it)
B000BP86OG|4.0|This new album sounds a bit like ELO doing the soundtrack for The Rocky Horror Picture Show; which mind you is not such a bad thing.  The Darkness has always been, for me at least, about indulging in my inner 80's cheese.  I never really understood the Queen comparisons, other than the tone and pitch of his voice.  The Darkness has always been a bit more Whitesnake, Quiet Riot, Ratt,  eighties Aerosmith.  So in that light, this is actually a much better album than \\"Permission to Land\\".  The albums production is over the top.  The layered vocals, the string sections.  I'm actually OK with it all. It all makes sense.  This is a fun rock album, and there's no real harm in that.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Being into action films, I heard many things about \\"Equilibrium\\".  Mainly, everyone talks about its gun, sword, and fist fights.  After finally seeing it (thank God I did), I realized there's so much more to the story than violence and action.  Underneath, you can find a beautifully written story that is both compelling and thought provoking. <br /> <br />In the beginning of the film, it is told that World War III has occurred.  The war's catalyst was emotion: people would have feelings and take their feelings out on others.  After WWIII, people all over the world were given a drug that would take away all emotions.  Noone could feel, which meant noone could harm anyone else.  This is what society has become. <br /> <br />Now, people who do not take the drug (\\"sense offenders\\") hide countless pieces of music, literature, art, and even animals so that they can feel like the others cannot.  This is where the government comes in.  They send in Clerics such as Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) to wipe out any sense offenders for their wrong-doings.  Clerics are also on the drug, so even after they kill many people, it doesn't affect them in anyway.   <br /> <br />All that changes after Preston kills his old partner, because he too was also beginning to \\"feel\\".  Preston misses the dosage of his drug and finally starts to realize what is actually happening in his world.  Using his his special up-close combat skills and his newly acquire emotions, Preston delves deeper into society and exactly who the good guys are: the government he worked for or the \\"sense offenders\\". <br /> <br />This film works on so many levels for me.  There are just so many great things that make it even more interesting to watch. <br /> <br />First off, the action scenes.  I hear many people say, \\"Oh, 'Equilibrium', it rips off 'The Matrix' in terms of action.\\"  Okay, first, \\"The Matrix\\" is overrated.  Second, the action scenes are \\"so\\" different.  There is no bullet time, no CGI, no wire, kung-fu stuff.  The way Preston fights may seem a bit unrealistic, but this is the future, and the battles are choreographed tightly and are never too long, which doesn't leave our minds numbed, but actually making us want more.  In other words, that battle scenes just plain out rock. <br /> <br />Second, Christian Bale.  It's his job to either make or break this movie.  He totally makes it and passes the mark.  He is excellent.  Words cannot describe his transformation from his wooden state to all out resistance fighter.  It's so perfect and makes sense (no pun intended).  Also, SPECIAL NOTE (SPOILERS) - if you do not cry or shed a tear in the scene with the dogs and Christian Bale's expressions, there is something wrong with you.  A beautiful moment.  Besides that, Taye Diggs, Emma Watson, and Sean Bean were also awesome in their roles which were fairly minor.  Yet, this movie is seriously Christian Bale's.  <br /> <br />Third, the direction from Kurt Wimmer is really nicely done.  The pacing is perfect and flows nicely, but not too fast.  The action sequences are also nicely edited, instead of being a mess of close-ups and quick edits (Batman Begins - take notes).  Very good job in direction. <br /> <br />Four, after watching this film, it felt really uplifting and satisfying.  I know this section has nothing to do with the technical or plot aspects of the film, but I just wanted to point out that the movie is just a poetic thing to watch unfold.  It's nicely written, and just perfect. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Equilibrium\\" was an intense action film inside a amazingly structured story.  The film has many underlying messages and is definitely one to watch over and over again. <br /> <br />Rated R for thematic elements and sequences of intense, violent action. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Good for Mariah on being nominated 8 times for Grammy Consideration for this album..
B00005JO1Y|3.0|King Kong...having viewed the 1933 version a long time ago, I still remember seeing the claymation and funny animations of Kong and the dinosaurs.  Although it was far from realistic, it was still a lot of fun to watch. <br /> <br />Fast forward 72 years and now Academy Award winner Peter Jackson is finally doing the picture he's always wanted to make.  Having enjoyed Jackson's other films such as \\"The Frighteners\\" (underrated), and the \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\" (just perfect), I was looking forward to this remake a lot, even though I'm not a big fan of remakes in the first place.  Yet, Kong seemed like it needed to be updated and that's what Jackson did with CGI....lots of CGI...did I say CGI? <br /> <br />Before I get into my qualms with the film, I explain the story.  The film takes place in New York in the 1930's and we are introduced to Carl Denham (Jack Black), who has just chartered a boat to Skull Island to film his next picture.  After learning from his assistant, Preston (Colin Hanks), that their main actress just dropped out, he finds Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a down on her luck actress who is looking for a job.  Taking Ann and Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), a playwright and also writer of Denham's script, he sets up his crew and ship and takes off to Skull Island.   <br /> <br />When they finally reach Skull Island, they learn what the island is hiding: creepy natives, dinosaurs, spiders, centipedes, man-eating grubs, and a big hairy ape...and yes, they are all CGI. <br /> <br />At the island, Ann falls into the hands (and heart) of King Kong, the big ape and saves her from many of the island's beasts.  The crew of the ship believe that Kong would make a fortune as a showcase back in New York, so they capture him and bring him back to the big Apple, where he breaks loose and looks for his love...Ann. <br /> <br />Now, I'm sorry if I just kind of breezed through the plot summary or gave some things away, but the story is basically identical to the original, except for now we have...CGI. <br /> <br />Okay, well let me talk about what I did like... <br /> <br /> - I thought the action sequences were pretty superb even if far-fetched.  They kept my adrenaline pumping and were very enthralling.  They don't let up at all once the crew is on Skull Island. <br /> <br /> - the characters in the story were nicely fleshed out.  I enjoyed Adrien Brody and his character and Naomi Watts was a great Ann Darrow.  Going into this film, Jack Black didn't strike me in an action-adventure film.  After seeing \\"School of Rock\\", \\"Orange County\\", and other comedies, you wouldn't think it.  Yet, he came through very well and surprised me.  Yet, I really liked the other characters of the crew...Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis in particular were very good and I enjoyed watching them. <br /> <br /> - Peter Jackson, as always, had some great direction going for him.  The cinematography and action scenes were all perfect.  I just wish the pacing could have been a bit more smooth for me.  It seemed to jump from slow scenes to fast ones, which annoyed me a bit, but was nothing major. <br /> <br /> - Kong: the main reason to probably see this film.  To say the least, he looked amazing.  The modeling of his face, his actions, and everything were just spot on...too bad the same can't be said for other animals as well. <br /> <br /> - Peter Jackson also made a few horror films in his time and he shows off some disturbing images in this story.  I liked how this film was a strong PG-13 and didn't pull away a lot.  The scene with the bugs, critters, and spiders in the pit is one of the scariest things I have ever witnessed: period.  Kudos to Peter Jackson for that scene...outstanding.  Be warned though: if you are squeamish or do not like death, this movie is not for you.  A lot of people die in this film and don't think just because it's PG-13, they won't show anything.  It gets nasty... <br /> <br />That was mainly the good, now onto the bad. <br /> <br /> -  relationship between Ann and Kong.  Although cute, I didn't like how it would break into the crew's strugge for survival.  This is where pacing comes into play.  You would have Ann and Kong playing together, then switch to people being eaten by dinosaurs.  Minor qualm. <br /> <br /> - CGI!  As I stated above, Kong was perfect and awesome in everyway.  The other creatures on the island were okay as well.  The dinosaurs were fine and so were the other critters, but many times it looked as if they were not fully rendered and that detracted from my experience.  Also, I love the \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\" and I thought the CGI served a purpose in the story.  In \\"Kong\\", after seeing dinosaurs, centipedes, spiders, and lizards...I was kind of tired when they reached the flying bats, which showed that the CGI became more of a nuisance then \\"Oh my God, how did they do that?\\".  I wanted to say that line so many times during this movie, but alas, I could not. <br /> <br /> - the length of the film was just way too long.  Many snippets could have been cut out...that's all that needs to be said. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"King Kong\\" was entertaining, but nowhere near \\"classic\\" territory.  Peter Jackson again gives us another interesting film with special effects and action, but the length, and CGI overkill seem to damper the experience.  Now, when's \\"The Hobbit\\" coming out?! <br /> <br />Rated PG-13 for strong violence, extremely disturbing images, and some gore.
1573300403|5.0|There are some amazing high-lights in this video that just remind a person exactly why Michael Jackson reached such off-the-scale stardom in the first place. <br /> <br />There is the performance that he put on at the MTV Awards in about 1995, which gives you the Billie Jean performance all over again - only much better.  By now, Michael Jackson has developed with an extra inner magic as an addition to what he already had.  He is even slicker and even more cool.   <br /> <br />Among many of my favourite short films is Earth Song.  Not only is it a hugely powerful song but, combined with the powerful visual images, it reaches the heart and imagination with great impact.  This work is hugely unconventional and deep with meaning. It just took my breath away. <br /> <br />\\"Michael Jackson: History on Film, Vol. II\\" demonstrates the artist's growth and development since those incredible old days. <br /> <br />
B0009S3HI0|4.0|This is a great idea- 1 side of b-sides and the other of acoustics- many songs of which I wasn't too familiar with but seem pretty solid. The DVD is well-edited and contains great coverage of all 4 major albums of the Tones. I like how the band leaves just enough out to sustain their mistique. In this respect, this is probably why they have outlived bands like limp bizkit and korn. Musically, the sound is amazing- guitars rifts and bass are so unique, as is Chino's weird screaching/screaming noises and voice.   <br />Best music video- My Own Summer. I like how Chino falls into the water at the end and gets devoured by sharks! Be Quiet and Drive is interesting (under some freeway overpass). Minerva is plain erie- I liked how they went out into the middle of butt-f nowhere to shoot it. Change is a brilliant video that reminds me of some old college parties. These are all very creative videos that really set different moods. But that's what makes the Deftones great. <br />This band is sick. Definitely looking forward to their new album in 06.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I've been a devoted KoRn since right after Issues debuted so when this new album came out I immediately got it and heard the major changes to their style. The most pronounced change was Feildy making the bass on the new album more subtle which was disappointing but overall this album more than makes up for the few shortcomings it has making this one of the best metal albums to date.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ok those of you saying Roadrunner changed Opeth are grasping for a reason to not like this album.    You should familiarise yourselves with the old Roadrunner catalogue before resigning yourself to thinking roadrunner is all rap metal.    And if you are, did you hear any rap metal on this album????  I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> <br />I will always give a band my undying respect for trying something new.  I said this about Meshuggah's latest work eventhough I was very dissappointed.  THankfully Opeth didn't do the same.   Not since Blackwater Park have I listened to an Opeth straight through withough skipping a song.  Not that they have bad songs, but come on, we all have songs we'd rather listen to than others.   I'm utterly entranced with every song on this album, however.   Instead of giving us a beautiful session of power, this album is more subdued and haunting.   I wasn't suprised to read Akerfelt was reading alot of horror when he wrote this album.  And the final track, Isolation Years, is just chilling and gorgeous.   <br /> <br />All of you looking for Children of Bodom and other slam-bang deathmetal bands need to stick with those bands.   Nothing against them of course, but Opeth isn't your cup of tea if you want blast beats and decapitation in your music.  Otherwise, this album is worth every penny of your money.
B0002XL35G|5.0|I bought this DVD bec. of the 4.5 rating, and I love this movie, this is a movie where you can share this with anyone, a very life touching movie, there are a lot of people out there who suffers like jane and travis did, I have already let my children see this movie......
B0007GADZO|3.0|I have to say there is only one flaw to the cd. Steve sings one song too many. Vai is a Guitar god, but when it comes to using the ol' vocal-pipe, it kinda isn't so great. But let's talk about the good. Building A Church and Freak Show Excess, are some of the catchiest songs written by Steve Vai. Not to mention I bought the cd just for Lotus Feet. That song is the BOMB! If you like solo music, I would recommend this cd to you. If you just like band stuff, I wouldn't.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I can't understand how anyone could say anything negative about this album.  The songs here are absolutely beautiful, profound, and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br />Stevens' \\"50 States Project\\" is a goal beyond the reach of any mortal songwriter, but I hope Stevens is able to record as many albums similar to this as possible (maybe a dozen or so, would be my estimate) over the course of his career.  I'm already looking forward to the next installment.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Peter Jackson took a lot of the original material from the 1930s King Kong and ran with it like a broken field football player on a hundred yard run. What he produced was a grand, sprawling mess of a movie that entertained and made one shiver and cry in turn. He masterfully recreates the world of the 1930s, including an art deco New York wallowing in the Depression. The creatures on Skull Island, not the least of which is the twenty five foot ape, are created in all of their horrific splendor. Standout performences include Jack Black, as a smarmy film producer, and Naomi Watts, the beauty who killed the beast. Watts is especially a heart breaker, who can make one believe that she can make anyone or anything fall in love with her, even a giant ape.
B000006045|2.0|Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO.  This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps \\"Becoming X\\", etc.  There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length....repetitive running loops while a guy mumbles self aware hipster-speak gets dull fast. Ya know, getting a few decent female soul singers and a sequencer doesn't make a good record.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|It used to be that Madonna would release something, do something shocking and 2 million people would run out and buy the new release.  Give this a listen at Napster, Yahoo music or wherever, and save your $13.49 unfortunatley there is nothing here worth hearing twice so you dont need to buy it.  It is not retro it isnt even re-hash, it is confusion of genres at best with an attempt of trying to differentiate the same old thing yet again.
B000AJJNPY|3.0|Still a good album but admidst the good songs there is too much fluff.  I feel as if I'm listening to the score of a disney film and I'm supposed to be feel very joyous. The emotions just aren't as deep, jagged and groovy as previous albums.  I never want to scream and yell and dance. Mostly I just want to sleep and feel warm fuzzies.  Previous albums could make you want to do all of these things in the span of one song.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|While the new King Kong movie is not the modern masterpiece that Jackson's Tolkien trilogy is, it still has its share of amazing scenes.  The scene where Kong fights three T. Rex's is worth the price of admission all by itself.  The special effects are generally excellent; most importantly, Kong looks and sounds pretty real.  There were a couple of times I found the computerized effects unconvincing, particularly when the humans were being chased through a canyon by dinosaurs.  The story was a little thin in some ways, such as the slightly chopped-up relationship between Watts' and Brody's characters, but again the movie comes through where it counts, expertly delivering a big dose of tragedy in the main Kong-Ann storyline.  I was only mildly distracted by two other minor flaws in the movie: (1) the score is mostly great but gets off-track a couple of times, especially the Enya-esque angelic chorus playing during a giant insect attack on three characters, and (2) the requirement to suspend disbelief was a bit heavy at a couple of points, particularly when the Brody character is saved from the previously mentioned giant insects (which are crawling all over him) by someone repeatedly firing a Tommy gun directly at him... And not one bullet even scratches him despite killing the bugs?  Overall, though, I definitely enjoyed King Kong 2005 a lot.  It pretty much met my expectations and even lived up to the trailer (for a change)!!  Then again, I was NOT expecting another L.O.T.R. (as some folks apparently were).
B0000028SU|4.0|I agree with Glenn J Wiener, with the music fan from Minneapolis, and with any others who say that this album is underrated. It is! I liked it a lot when it was released, and I still do. The songs are strong and the playing, while perhaps lacking some of the personality of the E Street band, is nevertheless workman-like and effective enough. And Bruce, who was obviously in a restless state when this (and Human Touch) was released, is in very good voice. Speaking personally, my wife and I used the beautiful If I Should Fall on a wedding mix CD we made to give to our guests. It's a gorgeous tune, as is Beautiful Reward. And songs like Better Days, Lucky Town and Leap of Faith sound triumphant. So it's a record that covers a handful of moods, but covers them very effectively, something Bruce Springsteen can do so very well.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Let's get one thing out the way:  \\"King Kong\\" ain't perfect.  In trying to weld the cornball tone of the original \\"Kong\\" with a more modern sense of gravitas, gifted director Peter Jackson and fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens found that they sometimes had to force fit the two.  No example is more glaring that the father-son relationship between the Venture's first mate (Evan Parke) and a cabin boy named Jimmy (Jamie Bell), who work hard to reconcile their often cheesy dialogue, and the strain shows.   <br /> <br />But in the end, that is just a minor nit-pick in the face of the most bracingly exciting and enormously entertaining movie of the year.  Peter Jackson has brought his dream project to life with enough soul, humor and smarts that far outweigh any problems that the film has.  Audiences will already know the plot before the first frame rolls:  An obsessive New York filmmaker named Carl Denham (Jack Black) cons a crew, a ship, screenwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) and down on her luck actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to travel to an uncharted pacific Island where he plans to shoot his masterpiece.  Of course once the ship arrives, they find vicious natives who notice that Ann would make a perfect sacrifice to their native God Kong, who turns out to be giant Ape.  Kong makes off with Ann, eventually discovering they share a deep bond and the common enemy in the other inhabitants of the Island.  From then on, Jackson kicks into overdrive, barreling through one incredible action scene after another with an assortment of creatures that up the intensity quotient for all other fantasy and action films that are destined to follow in his wake. <br /> <br />To say \\"King Kong\\" is spectacular is an understatement.  I can't think of another film this year that even begins to match the technical prowess and digital wizardry shown off by Jackson, cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, editor Jamie Selkirk and the miracle workers known as Weta digital.  The visual effects provided by Weta are absolutely staggering, both for their near perfect realism and exhilarating urgency.  From the stunning resurrection of 1930's New York to the beauty and terror of Skull Island, they sweep the audience to a lost world.  Oh, and their with Kong?  Sheer brilliance.  Working with Andy Serkis in a motion capture studio, Weta and Jackson have brought the Ape to life with equal parts fierceness and emotional depth, making Kong breathe with life.  <br /> <br />However, all the technical achievements in the world would not matter a bit if Jackson did not get the characters right.  But he did.  Jack Black proves a great bit of casting, playing Denham as he is: an obsessive, amoral weasel.  Adrien Brody takes the less relevant role of Jack Driscoll and has fun with it, giving off subtle humor and masculine confidence.  Naomi Watts is phenomenal as the struggling vaudville actress Ann Darrow who develops a deep, loving bond with Kong.  The beauty and the beast dynamic that was instrumental to the success of the original is just as prevalent here, and Watts and Andy Serkis as Kong make you believe wholeheartedly in that bond.  It is palpable, funny and ultimately tragic.  It is the beating heart of a film that reminds us of just how exciting and memorable movies can be.  Here's hoping Peter Jackson keeps making movies for a long, long time.
B0002XL35G|1.0|I purchased this movie from Amazon because I couldn't find it as a rental and there where many excellent reviews.  Oops!<br /><br />The bleak open landscapes and the mystery of a man walking across the desert create a wonderful opening scene.  From here on out the movie goes downhill. I am a Generation Xer that actually has patience.  I don't mind extensive dialogue if it has a point.  You don't need special effects or action to make a movie, but a good story can easily be ruined by pointless minutes of footage.  The DVD has a special feature of deleted scenes. That is really funny to watch after you have spent 45 minutes watching one scene of dialogue. Pain, desolation, and heartache can be portrayed by emotional dialogue, but the viewer doesn't need to suffer and suffer and suffer. There is a good reason you can't find this movie for rent.
0385504209|5.0|I finished the book in about two days. Couldn't put it down it was so exciting! And nothing like I've ever read before. I'm not religious nor into fine art too much but this book made me think and wonder if it all could be true and what else could there be hidden in ancient books and art pieces that we don't know about. And all this put into a story that's very exciting from beginning to end. I can't wait for the movie to come out. Also, if you liked this one make sure you read the Angels and Demons, you're going to love it!
B0000039QA|5.0|Let's face it, Life After Death is better than All Eyez On Me. I'm not dissing 2pac(he's my favorite rapper and dropped The 7 Day Theory, the best hip/rap cd ever released) but his first deathrow release can't compete with Life After Death. Biggie really outdid my expectation with this release. It's so much better than Ready To Die, which had some really weird beats and subpar rhyming.(great story telling though) Life After Death has amazing beats, incredible storytelling, almost flawless flows, and great rhyming. 2pac's All Eyez On Me could only beat Life After Death in the rhyming section. Oh, for all the people leaving comments saying Biggie's horrible and listen to 2pac instead, why can't you just say they were both great MCs? Buy this cd and the upcoming Duets cd! I heard it on MTV's \\"The Leak\\" and it's crazy. The beats are some of the best I've heard and Eminem out did his verse on \\"Dead Wrong\\" with a verse on the track \\"It Has Been Said.\\" \\"Big Pun, The Game, and Jay Z drop some amazing verses on here too. The Game's really improved from his one-two syllable rhyimng on The Documentary to a three-four syllable rhyming scheme. Buy Life After Death and The Biggie Duets. Ready To Die and Reborn are worth checking out too.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is an amazing movie. Sure, when you look at it from afar, you see some flaws - for example, a lot of important plot points flash by very quickly, and one can even say they are glossed over. One example of this is the feud between the Italians and the blacks, which gets a passing mention but is the reason for Harry and co.'s financial problems in the story (they got Tyrone arrested, Harry spent all the money they'd earned getting him out, etc.). However, these problems are minute when compared to the strengths of the film - its sheer power over the viewer, the hauntingly beautiful music, and the top-notch acting and directing. <br /> <br />The IMDb entry for this movie has an excellent one-sentence summary of this movie: \\"The hopes and dreams of four ambitious people are shattered when their drug addictions begin spiraling out of control.\\" Because, really, that's what the movie's about. Addiction, whether to drugs or daytime TV or chocolate or what-have-you-not, is the downfall of these characters, and this movie has been made (well, and the book has been written, as well) as a requiem for their dreams. <br /> <br />Another thing I love about this movie, and it's just a personal thing, is the relationship between Harry and Marion. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly have incredible chemistry. Not only that, but I like how their relationship had already been established before the movie, so it's not a boy-meets-girl story. Woot. <br /> <br />So, yeah, I love this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sadly, I'm a bit late to the Firefly party. I saw the movie Serenity, and loved it.  I soon found out it was based on the tv series Firefly, so I immediately went out and bought these dvds.<br /><br />After watching all of the series, I am now even more impressed.  What an amazing show.  Detailed, complex and interesting characters. Realistic personalities, not the typical cartoon characters in most tv series. The characters and story lines aren't watered down politically correct vanilla.  Characters actually stay in character and do the things you would expect them to do in that situation, even it wasn't... nice.  Acting was spot on.  Even though there are a lot of characters, you get pulled into caring about all of them.<br /><br />The set & special effects are top notch and movie-like (not cheapy typical tv).  I didn't really notice it the first time I watched it (because I was intent on the show) but there is some really interesting cinematography here, very different than traditional movies/tv... and it really makes you feel like you are part of the story rather than just watching it.  Awesome, awesome stuff.<br /><br />How Fox execs could be so short sighted and cancel this show, I have no idea.  Some of the best tv ever made.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|i think if roland emmerich would have directed this movie and had the same finished product people would not be giving it 5 stars. from what i see people are given peter jackson 2 much credit. yeah the lord of the rings trilogy was great, but he not that great of a director.anyway back to kong. the movie was good it just had to many moments of over the top stuff.example, when kong first had naomi watts and is shaking her like crazy, come on you shake any human that way and youll die.she gets thrown around like a puppet and shes ok not even a broken bone.lol. also they shoot dinosaurs like nothing and they die but they shoot kong a million times and he's ok. 1 more. the scene when they are all running from the dinosaurs the cgi kinda sucks and you can tell it was bluescreen big time.theres a few more but i dont wanna bash the movie too much cause i liked it. its just you guys are give it a little 2 much credit just cause jackson directed it.the cgi on king kong himself is very good i must say.
B000BEZPQE|4.0|I was at the show at the Glendale Arena in Phoenix (actually, Glendale) Arizona, where several tracks from this album were recorded. I wasn't a huge Slipknot fan, but a friend had an extra ticket and swore that I wouldn't regret it, that Slipknot is a band everyone needs to see live at least once. I came away converted (though I'm not sure I'm ready to call myself a \\"maggot\\" just yet.) Say whatever else you will about Slipknot, these guys know how to put on a show. I've been to a lot of rock concerts, and Slipknot is tied with U2 in 1987--yes, I am dating myself--for the best show I have ever seen. The energy and interaction between the band and the fans is amazing, and everyone in the arena that night got their money's worth. That's a rare thing in an era where rock music is increasingly weak and few bands even have the ability to fill arenas.       Most live CDs contain a fair amount of overdubs to correct the inevitable mistakes but Slipknot seems to have done little of that here. You hear the songs as they were played, warts and all. That means you hear squelches of feedback, some missed cues, the occasional mangled lyric, and the way Corey Taylor's voice gets increasingly ragged as the set wears on. The tracks pretty much mirror a Slipknot set list, with a few surprises thrown in like the never-played-live \\"Skin Ticket\\" and the title track from \\"Iowa,\\" which features some truly impressive bass and tribal drumming. The more complex tracks from Vol.3 work better live than I would have thought, particularly \\"Blister Exists\\" and \\"Vermillion.\\" Joey Jordison's drum solo is a highlight, the best I've heard (and seen) since Neil Peart in his heyday. The songs are mixed to blend together like the flow of an actual concert, though it doesn't quite work because of definite differences in crowd noise between Phoenix, Las Vegas (a show in a much smaller venue, The House of Blues) and Singapore. About the only real complaint I have is the number of f-bombs, mf-bombs and s-bombs Corey drops between songs; there's a point where constant swearing loses it's shock value and just sounds stupid. But other than that, \\"9.0 Live\\" is as solid a live album as you will find. It captures the essence of a band at its peak and proves that to appreciate Slipknot, a band which is definitely an acquired taste, you need to hear (and see) them performing in front of a roaring crowd.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|im glad to hear a new korn album. like most great cds it took a few listens to really like this one.most people are saying this is korn totally different,the evolution of korn. well not really if i had to compare it to any korn album it would be untouchables. it has a lot of what untouchables had, an industrial feel to it. i enjoyd this album alot but theres one very important thing missing. head. he was the most talented of the five members even korn says it in the duece dvd. but munky does step up and does a good job.over all it is better than there last album but thats it. i liked the others better than this one. my fav songs are, coming undone,liar,thow me away.the next single should be coming undone.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I trully enjoyed this album. Madonna has done it again...she KICKED ASS!!!! Although i enjoyed the whole album, i am addicted to \\"JUMP\\"!!! What a great song. It won't be long til that skank Britney and the other peroxide no-talent bimbos start copying Madonna's new style. Overall, there's only ONE Queen Of Pop.......MADONNA.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Wow a great cd from Madonna. I have her 2 greatest hits and her music cd which was good but this one bets it. After he last cd American Life did poorly Madonna competly changes her music style and dose a great job. The music is full of 70's dance tracks that will keep you moving. A rare cd in which all songs have the same sound this cd has it. There are a few not so good songs like Isaac and How high. But there are great songs like Hung up, and almost all the other songs.
B0007GAERG|3.0|i didnt think it was as good as the people who gave it five stars or as bad as the people who gave it one star, i liked some of the songs a lot but some of them in my opinion were not as good as i though they would be. actually, the main reason i am writing this review is to tell the people who are going \\"ewww\\" or \\"omg i cant listen to this crap\\" to shut up because when people read these reviews it is to find out if the album is good or what other people think about it not to hear people constantly bitching about how much they hated it. it is okay to dislike something and if you hate it that much go ahead and give it one star but dont write nasty things about the artist. you can say you thought they were better at some other time but there is no need to call her a banchee because she sings high pitched or call her an old bat ... to the people who said this you know who you are. and these reviews are reviewing the album, the emancipation of mimi, so stop dissing her and calling her a cash-in because you arent reviewing her you are reviewing her album. but all in all i give it three stars and she isnt as bad as some bitchy people say she is.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Whether for driving, something to play while you're cleaning the house, or music at a get together, this CD is just downright awesome. If one would appreciate music for music and not be a snob about it all (like some of the other reviewers who probably got mad when Soul Meets Body started getting radio time and claimed the band had \\"sold out\\"), he/she would realize what an incredible sound the band has achieved, one that is distinctly their own. I absolutely love I Will Follow You Into The Dark (which is even better when they perform it live), Summer Skin, and Different Names For The Same Thing. If you like the soft sounding genre of Death Cab, get this CD, you won't regret it
B00005JO1Y|2.0|I wasn't going to watch KING KONG but with all the great reviews from everyone I said what the hell I will go and watch this so called \\"instant classic\\". Man was I disappointed. First of all the movie started out way to slow. They spent to much time on the boat just trying to get to Skull Island. I gave it 2 stars because once they did make it there the special effects were great. The movie had some good action scenes in it with Kong fighting the T-Rex and when he was in New York on top of the Empire State Building. But the movie just dragged on for an hour to long. There were a lot of scenes that could have been cut or shorten and the viewer would not have lost anything from the story line. Overall I did not walk out of the theater last night thinking man I just saw a classic. If you are wanting to watch a classic go pick up Lonesome Dove.
0060574216|1.0|1. His \\"doctorate\\" is from an un-accredited school (the kind you find on the back of a matchbook). This is why over the years a number of his books have been published without the \\"Dr.\\" - apparently some of his publishers respected the title too much to let him fake it. <br /> <br />2.He's never done any actual 'research' in the field unless you call talking about relationships with people \\"research\\", as Gray apparently does. <br /> <br />3. He simply describes traditional sexual stereotypes in great depth, and then sells this outdated sexist bias as though it was psychology. It sells well because everyone can relate to at least part of it.  We all have -some- things in common with our gender stereotype, so we think he must be on to something.  What he's on to is a great marketing technique, not any kind of meaningful insight. <br /> <br />3. Twice when I was dating I had men complain to me about a previous woman who expected him to do everything for her and pay for everything because it was his role and he'd appreciate the relationship better.  From their descriptions it was clear that the women were following rules John Gray gives for dating.  Those women lost out by treating these guys as outdated stereotypes. <br /> <br />4. Each relationship is unique.  Each person you try to connect with is unique.  Honor their individuality and uniqueness and do your best to be authentic and to respond to the individual in front of you, not some stereotype of how men or women are supposed to be.  Being real in a relationship is risky, but it's worth it. <br /> <br />5. To read someone who has done real research in this field and is highly respected for his unbiased work, try reading Dr. John Gottman.  But don't expect him to tell you what all women or all men are like. <br /> <br />There should be a way to give an item like this a negative star rating. <br /> <br />
B000777J2S|5.0|there is nothing better, have the second glass of wine ready to go, then start the album.  AMAZING! who knew....??????  I am so taken back when I hear something new that blows me away!  He is incredable, his voice will Move you.  I am so tired of mr. boy george hearing of these amazing artist first... i.e. james blunt, a&TJ...etc.
B00000DFMN|4.0|In the '80's all the record producers were playing with their new technology and going for big, big, big drum sounds.  The Art of Noise went a step further and created impossibly huge, industrial-grade beats that came like bombs out of the speakers.  Kind of like Godzilla at the disco. The tune \\"A Time for Fear\\", first song on the first side (and so the listener's introduction to the album) is a real heavy marching-rhythm pounding with lots of scraping and screeching sampled noises. It always seemed funny to me and the Art of Noise seemed to be doing it all with a bit of a wink, so extreme as to be a kind of send-up of the popular taste of the time.  All the sampling, loops, etc. were part of a time-honored tradition of \\"musique concrete\\" dating from the '50's, which even the Beatles used on \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", so Art of Noise wasn't too radical in their use of that: their real innovation was the fusing of musique concrete with extreme industrial beats while still keeping it all user-friendly enough to make it on the radio.   <br /> <br />I never could figure out why \\"Moments in Love\\" was on this album except to provide some relief from the assault of the first half of the disc.  I never could take it seriously since the tone set by the first half of the disc was kind of jokey, and \\"Moments in Love\\" has an oh-so-mellow-and-sweet melody punctuated by synthesized orchestral blasts and samples of guys muttering...it seems less than sensuous in my opinion, but then I can't argue with the reviewers here who find it great for an intimate evening.  You can't argue with success!  <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewers here, though--if you like \\"Moments In Love\\" you'll probably not like the rest of the disc--and vice versa. But I think it's a fun album, and a bit of electronica history.  The sample of the girl shouting \\"Hey!\\" on \\"Close to the Edit\\" was in turn sampled by Prodigy on \\"Fire Starter\\", so I guess that makes Art of Noise a part of the tradition.
B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray's music has always been dear to me, for personal reasons and because i am a musician myself, and i feel that this is one of the greatest album i have ever heard.<br /><br />His lyrics are truely beautiful and his instrumentation is of the highest skill - he is on the same level as Bob Dylan lyrically and there are very few artists, if none, who match his musicality.<br /><br />His songs carry so much emotion that you cant help being moved by them, in particular, Disappearing World, Slow Motion and Ain't No Love are bound to bring a tear to your eye, whereas Alibi, Nos Da Cariad and From Here You Can Almost See The Sea will send shivers down your back!<br /><br />His music captures the very essence of human emotion and his lyrics speak to everyone and anyone. You won't hear this album - you'll feel it!<br /><br />This album is essential for everyones music collection - words can't discribe the masterpiece that is Life In Slow Motion - it is awesome in the litteral sense of the word.<br /><br />My advice is if you are already reading this, you should buy it, if you don't, you will be missing out on some of the greatest music ever written.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson does not disappoint once we get to Skull Island.  All hell breaks loose, to the point where you can hardly stand one more knock-your-socks off chase or reptilian battle.  Of course Kong and Naomi Watts are the star attractions here, and they are mesmerizing and, yes, heartbreaking together.  The movie is too long by an hour, and things take far too long to get started, but the final hour moves quickly, and the finale is expertly rendered.  I was disappointed in Jack Black's deer-in-the-headlights performance; not enough going on in that face.  But Kong is a miracle of CGI; he is more complex emotionally than almost anyone human in the film.  And Naomi Watts is luminous, and does perhaps the best job ever on film of someone working against a blue screen - the alliance these two improbable creatures form is as surprisingly stirring as it is fantastic.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Just go see it!!  Art for the sake of art.  please ignore sierocks review...the message of the film is beyond him!!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Not only the best album of 2005, but the best Sufjan Stevens album to date.  That's a pretty impressive statement, considering his practically flawless career as a solo artist.  What makes this album so great is that it captures the heart of the state of Illinois and invokes a celebration of the history and spirit of that state.  If you're like most people, the mention of the word \\"Illinois\\" usually doesn't invoke an enthusiastic response.  But if you've listened to this album, you will never think of the state of Illinois the same way.<br /><br />Beginning with the \\"Michigan\\"-remeniscent piano ballad of \\"Concerning The UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois,\\" the album immediately immerses the listener in a world entirely different from the one we are used to.  An orchestrated segue leads into one of the greatest songs on the album in \\"Come on Feel the Illinoise,\\" which, as ridiculous as it sounds, we undoubtedly do.  Following this is the song about serial killer, John Wayne Gacy, which will haunt you in your sleep if you're not careful.  Sufjan's voice faintly conveys the horror of his acts while humanizing a montster and humbling us all in the process.  Is there beauty in even the worst of lives? Apparently there is.  The remainder of the album takes the listener on a musical road trip with stops at love, heartbreak, faith, and rejoicing.  \\"Illinois\\" will surely go down as one of the greatest albums of all time and will hopefully propel Sufjan Stevens to the level of recognition he has been deserving of for years.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />\\"Come On! Feel The Illinoise!: Part I: The World's Columbian Exposition/Part II: Carl Sandburg Visits Me In A Dream \\"<br /><br />\\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Predatory Wasp Of The Palisades Is Out To Get Us!\\"<br /><br />\\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!\\"<br /><br />and \\"The Seer's Tower\\"
B00006879E|1.0|What we have here is an album of faux-rock white boy soul \\"music\\" that resembles N Sync if they could actually play instruments. The difference between N Sync and this band though is that N Sync are aware of the fact that they are cheesy. This band is not. The two things that you should know about this album going into it are that 1. The members of this band were once in a decent (but not lucrative) alternative rock band called Kara's Flowers and 2. This album is their way of cashing in and setting up a retirement plan.  <br />     That said, I must ask, has the world gone mad? How can a band that released one album 5 years ago still be popular? Even more perplexing is how any band can manage to milk one album for 5 years (the promo copies of this album actually came out in '99) as Maroon 5 have. Just what are they famous for anymore? And yet, I still see them at every awards show performing, and astonishingly, people still recognize them...and applaud. The only thing I can figure is that somehow, a large number of people feel some kind of emotional connection to this music and love the band unconditionally. Questionable taste aside, if this is true, these people's biggest mistake is assuming there is something emotional in the music to be connected to. Those people are the ones who are cheated the worst. They may not know what good art is, but they at least believe in its power, and they have been royally duped.  <br />     So in closing, let me clarify. This is not lovingly crafted music. It is manufactured music, a cold product that the record company has (rightly) assumed that people will consume like empty calories. But that's okay, because at the end of the day, it can be disposed of, like so much crap.
B000002AE3|5.0|This is the Toto Album that most people don't know about (great thanks to the record company) and it's a travesty.  Exceptional in all levels from songwriting, incredibly expressive soulful vocals, razor sharp but not overly textural musicianship and a vibe that is simply amazing. I analyze and listen to a variety of musical styles and like old R&B, melodic rock and Soul almost equally. This album blows me away from all those angles. This record has a depth of character that most musicians could simply never attain. Listen to it. Buy it. Live it.
B000BVD460|5.0|Do you get it? Em' released this Curtain Call is known as a compilation of his songs into 1 cd. So, don't just because it contains only a few new songs and judged it as a bad cd. You'll be glad because \\"when i'm gone\\" is 1 of the most influential Songs you ever heard from Em'.Not just some songs that had already made but unreleased to the public and put inside this cd. Although this Cd has some flaws ( like putting Superman instead of Like Toy Soldiers), but overall this is a great Album--compilation from Eminem, and every Hip-Hop Rap fans should get a copy of this.
B000B8QF14|2.0|Could this guy be any more pretentious?  He states in the DVD that he really gets off on everyone supporting his beliefs because they sing back his words to him.  Does it ever occur to him that this is quite an assumption and people sing along with loads of drivel that they may not even understand, let alone agree with? <br /> <br />And just because you're a rock star Billy boy doesn't make you the smartest guy on the planet.  I bet there's a redneck or two that would probably kick your ass on Jeopardy.   What the hell do you know about anyone who doesn't live in the bay area anyway?  You probably never ventured out of California before you became famous and now your perspective comes from hotel rooms.  What a fake! <br /> <br />And what is with all the gratuitious \\"England\\" screams?  Not only are they annoying and self-serving (ensuring crowd response) they seem ignorant considering the fact the equivilent would be and Englishman touring the U.S. and yelling \\"America\\" at every city.

B00097DX3U|5.0|This is so much better than their first release.  They have totally gelled as a new entity, and that's what scares so many of you - they've moved on, but too many of us Soundgarden and RAGE fans haven't.  It's been years, people!!  You should bow down and thank God that they came together for some in-your-face-rock and roll instead of all that other crap on the radio today.  It seems the only musicians who know what rock is (and still know how to play it) are the ones who survived the '90s - and have for the most part, cleaned up their personal lives (i.e. drugs).  From the Foo Fighters to Pearl Jam (who nobody pays attention to anymore, unfortunately, it seems; VERY much your loss) to the Red Hot Chili Peppers...they've only gotten better and better.  Out of Exile is fresh and new, like Audioslave themselves, and for the guy a couple before me who said this album was (I'll use different terminology) slowed up or more laid back than their first, you couldn't be MORE WRONG.  I could hear it on the cd before I even saw them live, but they are so comfortable with each other now, and seeing them from both tours - 4 times from this cd - they ROCK harder than ever.  I've seen Soundgarden and RAGE individually countless times, and I guarantee that all you naysayers have never been to an Audioslave show.  I think you're being unfair because you have seen one or the other - have your preference (I do, too) - but you're STUCK!!  Pull out your old cds and listen to them all you want, but don't discount the best thing that's happened in Rock music in years (what, you want to be stuck listening to Nickelback & pop-rock, Good Charlotte & all those other \\"chord-only-playing\\" guitar professionals, or Stain'd & all that emo stuff forever???).  By the way, I also base my opinion that this cd is better than their first on the fact that it was written by them differently, and although I loved each individual song, the first one seemed to be all over the place, while this one definitelyhas a flow.  Also, while recording the first one, T. Commerford even admitted that he didn't understand what some of the lyrics were about and had to ask CC!  Then he thought they \\"were brilliant.\\"  I think he gets it now.  You should give it a try, too.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am also very happy about those much deserved Grammy Nominations 8--WOW..madonna eat your heart out!
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Director Peter Jackson has done the seemingly impossible: he has revived the 70 year old King Kong franchise and more to the point: made it fun, exciting, romantic, scary and touching. All this from a story about a giant Ape, the woman he loves (the luminous Naomi Watts) and the man (a fun, demented Jack Black) who would exploit them.<br /><br />The CGI work is the best I've seen though at times the seams show...but not nearly as often as I would have thought. Also, at 3 hours the film is too long by about a ½ hour and most of this time is spent CGI'ing as in the characters fighting with and running from assorted pre-historic creatures. Most of this action is good and sometimes even amazing but there's just too much of it.<br /><br />Jackson does not skimp on the human element either. Though the storyline is basic he populates this film with the very best actors: Naomi Watts as his heroine Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Darrow and Adrian Brody as Jack Driscoll. All of these actors treat their characters with respect, give their all and it elevates their characters from wallpaper to living, breathing human beings.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\"is breathtaking on many levels and personal and touching on others: what more could you ask for in a movie?
B000003TSP|3.0|This is a much more challenging listen that \\"Dummy\\" but ultimately nowhere near as satisfying. The main problem is the mix - the sound on this is bone dry and Beth sounds like she's singing in another room. It's a pretty unique sound but very alienating and it hurts the songs. The other problem is that you just can't listen to this after having heard the \\"Roseland NYC Live\\" CD. The versions on that CD of the songs from this album are so superior to the versions here that it's not even funny. I heard NYC Live before I heard this and I think that's a big reason why I have never been able to get into this album. All in all, I agree with the other reviewer who said that \\"Dummy\\" and \\"Roseland NYC Live\\" complete the Portishead picture and this is really unnecessary if you have those two albums. Actually, NYC Live is probably their best release. I would recommend that to newcomers as ALL of the performances on that are improvements on their studio counterparts and it contains all of their best songs with the exception of \\"Numb\\".
B000002TQV|4.0|Oh dear, seems we have some aged pond life in our midst - the Led Zep fan hahahaha - Zep are/were a fab band but they are a totally different genre of rock - and did put out some decidedly dodgy hippy clap trap to boot. I think someone needs to go back to his cave and let the rest of us progress. <br />Incidentally if Radiohead have anything at all to do with influencing the likes of Coldplay and Keane then I for one would like to give Thom a friendly kicking - I wondered who to blame for all this MOR whiney dross, though for the life of me I cannot see the connection. <br />All power to Thom & the boys!
B00074CBMY|2.0|Joe needs to stick to high energy rock.  Except for \\"Chain of Fools\\", this album is all elevator music in a gravel pit.  Get the \\"Ultimate Collection\\" instead.
0380799006|5.0|...this book really helped me not only feel more prepared to handle my two kids, but also helped me understand some of the dynamics in my husband's family.   <br /> <br />It builds on the active listening skills I am trying to master from their \\"how to talk..\\" book, plus other books like Parent effectiveness Training that promote a more sensative, less punishing approach to parenting. <br /> <br />The format is great, the comics really summarize the points of each chapter well and I want to photocopy them to have them handy.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|This CD is amazing i love it!! Enigma is only of the best bands of all times Hands down! They only thing thats lil bad about it is there talking though most of the Ablum
B0006399FS|5.0|In my opinion, this is U2's best album since \\"Achtung Baby\\" in 1991, and their third best album ever.  (I would probably rank U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\" in my top 10 favorite albums of all time).  This stellar album is one of the Grammy nominees for 2005 Album Of The Year.  I actually thought this more rock-oriented CD was far better than their last CD \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", which was more \\"pop\\" than this one.  Being the insane concert goer I am, I ended up seeing U2 live in concert five times this year at Denver's Pepsi Arena, Houston's Toyota Center, and at Madison Square Garden.  These live shows brought the album's tracks to life for sure.  \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" is U2's dedication to New York City, \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" was Bono's poignant song written after his father died, \\"Yahweh\\" is an acoustic track about the trappings of fame, and \\"Miracle Drug\\" is a song Bono dedicated in concert to scientists, doctors, and nurses.  All of the songs on the CD are winners and none of them suffered from radio overkill. <br /> <br />Read some of my other reviews and you'll see that I'm not some rock head guy - I'm actually a huge fan of club music.  However, even with that being said, I have to say I'm kind of shocked by some of the low reviews on Amazon for this album.  U2 always seem to bring up this kind of controversy.  Their \\"big egos\\", their \\"overblown stage presence\\", their \\"preachiness\\".  Well, that's what makes them a great band.  There's no one else like that.  You'll miss them when they're gone.  Think about this - who's going to fill the stadiums when U2 and their generation have moved on?  50 Cent, Britney, Gwen Stefani?   <br /> <br />What makes this album great was the lack of hits and the lack of poppiness on it.  Its just a great rock and roll album.  And, yes, you really have to see the songs live to appreciate them. <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|Pisser the Misser-You missed it entirely. First of all what do you mean by, oh I believe the term you used was pu**ified.   What do you mean!  Listen I will not deny that RATM's message was as powerful as the music, but cut these guys some slack for Chr**sakes! People eventually grow up and become more discerning as their tastes become more focused and defined.  When it comes to comparing A*S to RATMFM.  It's apples and oranges.  However if you really want to get right down to it and try to compare both bands formulaically- A*S= a fine 12year old scotch/// RATMFM= a good thick lager]  Conclusion: both are fine and may be enjoyed,  however the older more experienced 12 year old scotch will always kick the a** off a good lager any day when it comes to sheer fire power!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Wow is there a lot of reviews of this CD already!  So I'll try to keep it brief.  Ok, relatively brief.  Let me lay it out for you.  I'm a huge Madonna fan that owns almost every Madonna single and album.  I even own \\"Remixed & Revisited\\", although for the record, I only gave it \\"2 stars\\" on Amazon.      Despite what anyone may say one way or the other, \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" is a worldwide smash.  It has gone to #1 in 36 countries - Madonna's best showing since \\"True Blue\\" in 1986.  Trying to stay as objective as possible, I believe this is Madonna's best album since at least \\"Ray Of Light\\" in 1998.  In my opinion her last album \\"American Life\\" was the worst of her career - it just flat out stunk.  Not because of the heavy political content mind you, but just because I found it to be so mind-blowingly boring.  Fortunately \\"Confessions\\" steers away from this formula by 180 degrees.    \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" is entirely dance/pop, segued together seamlessly from one track to the next like a DJ set.  But the best part about this CD is Madonna teaming up with Stuart Price - they are like a match made in heaven.  It's like the classic Madonna stories from the '80s - they actually worked on this album together in Stuart Price's modest two bedroom flat in London because Stuart hadn't made it big yet.  The sound these two came up with is edgy and innovative - it stands out from anything else in the mainstream arena right now.  \\"Hung Up\\" is by far not the best song on the CD - most of the other tracks are better, especially \\"Get Together\\", \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"How High\\".  Even \\"Isaac\\" with its Middle Eastern chanting caught me by surprise as being much better than I expected.  Only one song on the CD was a disappointment (\\"Push\\") and another one has awful lyrics (\\"I Love New York\\").      Most of the albums tracks are on course to be worldwide club hits in 2006.  (Hey, even \\"American Life\\" still yielded 4 #1 dance hits in the U.S.).  As to whether they'll be pop hits - well, several of the tracks will be in Europe and Asia.  As to the U.S., it'll be tough with all the R&B/hip-hop on the radio nowadays.  However, there's still the potential for another couple of big singles off this album - \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\".  \\"Jump\\" is honestly one of the best songs Madonna has ever done.    As to any negative reaction to this CD - it mostly has to do with possible use of samples and other artists' work.  There are certainly a lot of influences on this record - almost to the point where it becomes funny - Madonna even makes references to her own songs from time to time. You notice other bits where you go I \\"think\\" I've heard that before but I'm not sure.  All of this is done on purpose to make the songs more catchy - like adding the secret ingredient to Coke.  This is Stuart Price's style, and he's used when producing and remixing tons of other artists like Juliet, Gwen Stefani, even The Killers!  The only actual full sample used on the album is ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\".        And finally for you Mariah fans which seem hell-bent on wreaking havoc on every other artist that isn't Mariah - are you just not satisfied with all the exposure Mariah gets in the U.S.?  Madonna IS the biggest selling female artist in the history of the world.  Its listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records.  In the U.S., Madonna ranks second in all-time sales behind Barbra Streisand, not Mariah Carey.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|No other artist can sing \\"My Funny Valentine\\" like Streisand. She set the benchmark and truly captured the sentiment(not setimentality) of the song.  So..if an artist such as Mr.\\" great in his day but should now retire\\", Stewart,  wishes to cover this classic(not murder it), I suggest they step up to the plate and sing the song the way it is supposed to be sung...Dammit!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm 31 y/o former \\"grunge rock junkie\\" that now mostly listens to current dance/house music and a little pop, and who's favorite all-time artists are Madonna and U2.  Way back I was into Green Day when Dookie came out, carried through for Nimrod - then kind of got bored after that.  I thought they just started recycling the same ideas over and over again.  Then \\"Minority\\" came along I kind of paid attention again.  But this CD has truly made me a major fan! <br /> <br />Hands down, this was my favorite CD of 2005 - no contest.  If there's any one piece of music - one album to sum up the current state of America - the current state of politics - this is it.  Critically and commercially, no album with this kind of content has had more widespread impact this decade.  But what really cemented this album for me was two things.  First off, seeing Green Day in concert in August '05 for the first time - they just blew me away.  Second off, travelling to Europe - to Germany - and hearing the tracks from \\"American Idiot\\" on the radio every 5 minutes over there, and realizing how widely popular this album is.   <br /> <br />This album has everything that just 'nails' these times in America:   <br />  <br />\\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" - the disenfranchisement of the average American summed up in a catchy pop single <br />\\"Holiday\\" - their anti-Iraq war anthem <br />\\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" - became Green Day's dedication to the victims of Hurricane Katrina (and Rita) - and the most fitting and most poignant of all the dedications that were out there <br />\\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" - a 10 minute montage of 5 songs pieced together - the most daring song of the album (Green Day's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") <br />  <br />As far as what this CD did for Green Day's career:  in my opinion it took them to another level - from just an average modern rock band to superstar status - on par with bands like U2 now.  \\"American Idiot\\" is the third-biggest selling album of the year in the U.S., and one of Green Day's biggest selling CDs worldwide to date.  \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is the #1 Modern Rock Single for 2005 and also became Green Day's biggest pop hit ever going to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.   <br />
0446607274|4.0|I am a huge Connelly fan, and being an ex-LA resident (16 years, many in Hollywood) I really feel right there with the locales and politics of the city. This story revolves around a \\"Johnny Cochran police-injustice\\" type attorney getting murdered and due to the riots after the Rodney King brutality trial, there is fear of another riot erupting because people (potential rioters) will believe the police did the murder...HUH? I found this premise ridiculous, unlikely and unreasonable. BUT having said all that I enjoyed this novel because Connelly is \\"that good\\" with his story-telling that I simply went along with his \\"people-will-riot-at-the-drop-of-a-hat\\" plot.
0800177177|5.0|I love this movie.  I have loved it ever since it came out!  Whenever it comes on the tv I run to watch it, even thought I own it on DVD.  This movie touches on the love aspect of dracula and what he went through for love.  It touches on the whole \\"church\\" issue of Dracula being made or coming from the church.  I can't think of another recent Dracula movie that even comes close.  I definite must see!  :)
B000002TQV|1.0|This album is worthless. I am a huge music fan but I never understood the appeal of this band. If you good rock music, buy something from Led Zeppelin - the Greatest Band Of all Time. Radiohead are boring and WACK. Sorry Radiohead fans, you can vote that my review was not helpful, but that doesnt mean that saying this music is good is showing nothing but ignorance.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|If your first time viewing is anything like mine was, well...I didn't like it.  After getting it on video, I found myself watching it more and more and finding it to be really funny.  Sure, I thought the film was \\"silly\\" and Madonna's acting felt like, well, \\"acting\\", but it turns out that I can't stop laughing when I'm watching it.  Her lines are funny and so are her leading man's reactions.  Thank God it has finally come to DVD.  The film bombed when it came out (guess I wasn't the only one at first who didn't care for it) and soon had it's own fan following after video release. <br /> <br />The film is based loosely on the Katherine Hepburn/Cary Grant film \\"Bringing Up Baby.\\"  In BUB, the story is about a man who can't escape a girl who also is babysitting a cougar.  In WTG, the story is about a man who can't escape a girl who is babysitting a tiger.  In WTG, they have created a different plot but basically the outline is still the same as I have stated. <br /> <br />The actor who plays Madonna's leading man was best known in \\"An American Werewolf In London\\" by being the lead's best friend killed by a werewolf after leaving a pub and heading into the fog with him. <br /> <br />Who's that girl is classic, and will definately recall the times of the 1980's but that's okay.  I'm overjoyed this wonderful film is finally available on DVD.  Watch it more than once and you'll find yourself with a new guilty pleasure.
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show~ Eminem is a stupendous album. Eminem is an amazing lyricsts. His lyrics are filled with wit, inteligence, sarcasm. He is also an great rapper and he has a surprisingly good vocals. The production value is first class and the samples and keyboard sounds are right for the sound. The book-let is a great pice of work. The photos are  amazing, the font is easy on the eye and unlike many artists the vocals can actually be read. Eminem says exactly what is on his mind and he does not mix his words which is so refreshing and even if sometimes you do not totally agree with what he says I totally admire someone for being this adament about what they believe. This is an album for the ages. Totally recommended.
1577314808|5.0|Why does Amazon put the most negative reviews at the top?? Reviewers disliking Tolle's repetition of the simple, essential message demonstrate the ego-mind's incessant demand for more! more! new! different! \\"Tell me something I don't already know.\\" This is the very addiction we all share, that Tolle addresses fully. Research has long shown that repetition of a message is necessary to break entrenched mental patterns. <br /> <br />With the humility of beginner's mind, one can find in this book methods of true, \\"razor's edge\\" practice whose depth, transformative significance and power are absolutely real.   <br />

B000002KJQ|5.0|While I have all of their albums the first 3 albums are the best and this is my favorite.  I had never heard a blues rock band with such a groove. I remember late  1972 or early 73 walking in to a record store and hearing it on the sound system. They were playing \\"waitin for the bus\\".  IT was so powerful. I found the store guy and asked who it was? in spite of my limited budget with a new wife and kid on the way, I bought it right away. This is a must have for ZZ top lovers, Blues guitar lovers, and southern rock lovers.<br /><br />Still Love it!!!
B000A2XC1C|4.0|\\"Santa Claus, The Movie\\" is a film that my family and I watch every year at Christmas. As time goes on, I am sure it will be recognized as one of the all-time classic yuletide movies. As a Child of the 80's, this movie holds a special place in my heart, and only the presence of the superb \\"One Magic Christmas\\" (both from 1985) prevents me from giving \\"Santa Claus\\" 5 stars. <br /> <br />The late Dudley Moore plays the elf Patch in \\"Santa Claus\\", a sort of brilliant renegade inventor trying to become Kris Kringle's apprentice. John Lithgow overacts (wonderfully) as B.Z., the evil toy company owner who is out to use Patch's naivete (and magic powers) to take over Christmas and put Santa - who he considers competition - out of business. <br /> <br />The most magical scenes in the movie, however, take place at the beginning, as a mortal Claus discovers he is the Chosen One, meets the elves, and discovers what his role is going to be down through the centuries. The first flight of his sled is amazing, and the lack of fancy CGI animation is strangely welcome. <br /> <br />This movie has been ignored, basically because it belongs to a generation who has not yet come into its own culturally. The dominant movies are still \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" and \\"A Christmas Story\\". But, as people who grew up with those classics age, a new crop of movies will be fondly remembered. When that time comes, I am certain \\"Santa Claus, the Movie\\" and \\"One Magic Christmas\\" will be recognized as two of the best seasonal movies of all time. <br /> <br />This 20th-anniversary edition of \\"Santa Claus\\" may be the first step. Do yourself a favor and order it from Amazon at its very reasonable price, and make up your own mind.
1592400876|2.0|While this may be a wonderfully humorous book, it still cannot compete with the major grammar resources for writers and editors.  I realize Ms Truss is a writer, and her bio does state that she was also an editor (though, it does not state for how long or how successful she was).  However, as the major, glaring, punctuational error on the front cover proves, even writers need editors . . . and apparently, so do editors.  <br /> <br />I am frustrated with the number of writers who quote \\"Eat Shoots and Leaves\\" as an argument for why they can stick a comma any darn place they please.  This book does quote some of the same rules I find in the reputable sources; however, it conflicts in others.  It looks as though Ms Truss was tired of the editors telling her to remove her commas and decided to write a book to back up her own argument. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this book unless, perhaps, you want a laugh.  I would never dishonor the valid resource books I own by placing this on the same shelf.
0345452585|2.0|How lame is the plot of THE CONSPIRACY CLUB?  So lame that even Kellerman realizes it.  Because he takes this \\"plot\\", with the same red herrings, twists, and \\"the old switcheroo on who the real killer is\\", and recycled it into half of his next Petra Connor series entry, TWISTED.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|this is by far the worst korn cd since issues. I guess the fact that they lost head really mad a different. Jonathan is being fake and its just sad. Can't they go back to playing things like blind or twist?
B000001FFJ|5.0|I was married with a cassette of \\"Rain Dogs\\" in my pocket. The marriage lasted 12 years, but the impact of Tom Waits' finest work lives on. There are many reasons why \\"Rain Dogs\\" is so special; The variety of mood and tone, the vivid imagery, the balance of humor and pathos are among them. But the most unique thing about it to me is the fact that everyone I know familiar with \\"Rain Dogs\\" has their particular favorites. \\"Singapore\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Downtown Train\\" are most often cited, but I've heard praise singled out for many others. I am myself, a huge fan of \\"Jockey Full of Bourbon\\", \\"Tango Till They're Sore\\" and \\"Gun Street Girl\\". The singing throughout is vintage Waits and so incomparable, while the woozy carnival of music alternates between down and dirty and rootsy dignity. For those unfamiliar, or even put off by Tom Waits' personae, this is the perfect introduction, as well as being his most enduringly fine work.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|In the abscence of six years for Bruce Dickinson and nearly a decade for Adrian Smith, the frontman and guitarist return to Iron Maiden for Brave New World, a nod at the new millenium and a whiff of things long since passed.  The opening cut, The Wicker Man, has a promising reminiscence of Aces High or Where Eagles Dare and it gets your heart pumping for some rocking Maiden...but the Maiden we get is old and a little tired.  (Do they really need three, count 'em, three guitarists? No!)  Definitely has that signature Iron Maiden sound, but the songs drag as most of the lyrics are repeated over and over.  Bruce is back, and that's a good sign, but it might be way too late.  Brave New World promises so much and comes up essentially flat.  The title track is pretty good.  After that we have two 9-minute-plus songs Dream Of Mirrors and The Nomad as well as some other rather lengthy tunes that could have been a hell of lot shorter.  Overall, not the Maiden we wanted or needed.  Listenable, but bring me The Number Of The Beast.<br /><br />Dig It!
0399152717|2.0|Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of \\"Raise the Titanic\\", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. <br />Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. <br />Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one.
B000002TPS|5.0|Countdown To Extinction is the greatest Megadeth album of all and one of the greatest metal albums ever made, and Dave Mustaine had to have realized that there is only one place to go from the top and that is down.  Now...Youthanasia comes out and Megadeth shows us that the fall from grace is going to be a very gradual one for the Megadeth boys.  A close to the perfection of Extinction, Youthanasia starts out with Reckoning Day and makes us pay attention right away.  Feel the power.  Train Of Consequences, Addicted To Chaos, A Tout Le Monde, Elysian Fields, The Killing Road, Family Tree, the title track & Blood Of Heroes list among the truly great songs on this album.  Megadeth makes strides to become a popular entity, but they are still heavy and anyone thinking that they sold out to the poser side of metal, think again.  A few weak spots, but nothing overpoweringly weak.  Still a strong effort.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|...This is a great album!...This, like all John Mayer live shows, displays the sheer talent that he has with a guitar.  I have listened to the album a few times and I am convinced that this is one of my favorite albums of the year.  Do yourself a favor buy this disc.  Listen to Gravity, Vultures, Out of my Mind, Another Kind of Green, and of course his classics Somethings Missing and Daughters.  This is Great, grab a glass of red wine, and put it through you best speakers and you will be in another world!
B0002EXH4A|3.0|Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica for a number of reasons, but the biggest factor was that he was a full-blown alcoholic and a drug addict.  Well...things hadn't changed much for Mustaine as he had continued on his course of self-destruction, moving on into heroin for sh*ts and giggles.  So Far, So Good...So What! is so marred by those afflictions and the inner turmoil of the band that Megadeth took a huge step backwards from the brilliance of Peace Sells.  Into The Lungs Of Hell, the promising into instrumental is so f*cking cool that you get the false sense that this album is going to absolutely rock.  Set The World Afire keeps the assumption going.  Then...we hit the tired old version of Anarchy In The U.K. with the botched lyrics and Dave's obvious intoxication.  Mary Jane is cool, but okay. 502 is a f*cking joke of a song, one of Megadeth's lamest.  In My Darkest Hour is brilliant and a Megadeth staple.  Awesome!  Liar bites.  This is just Dave talking sh*t to ex-guitarist Chris Poland in the form of a song.  Juvenile and pathetic. Which brings us to Hook In Mouth, one of my personal favorite Megadeth tunes.  Greatness again.  The overall problem of this album is its choppy inconsistencies.  Good song, bad song.  The orginal's production value was crap as well and I think that was because Dave ended up firing the producer or the record company did or whatever.  Definitely a lot of sh*t surrounding the making of this album created its lopsided sound.  Once again, bright spots and visions of brilliance, but otherwise an inconsistent glob of substance abuse and waring cast members.  Bummer.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000002J0P|5.0|There is no point in me reviewing this magical album, song by song, because listeners here have done such a wonderful job...  but I would like to say that for many of us, this was the background music to our lives.  When I hear this album, I am transported and become, once again, that young girl sitting on the floor with her record player, listening to beautiful harmonies, watching the rain gently fall out my window while visions of what may become of me, someday, filled my dreams.  Priceless.
B000002UUX|4.0|After the twarted disaster that was So Far, So Good...So What! Megadeth took some time off and Dave Mustaine got himself cleaned up a little for Rust In Peace.  Enter Marty Friedman, shredder extraordinaire.  Just one listen to the opening track Holy Wars...The Punishment Due and you know that Dave has found his man and his sound.  One of my personal all time favorites and a Megadeth standard, Holy Wars absolutely f*cking rocks on every level!  Hanger 18, another Megadeth standard is cool, but not the greatest of their tunes.  Take No Prisoners rocks.  Lucretia is very cool.  Tornado Of Souls is another Megadeth classic & Rust In Peace...Polaris is middle of the road.  A few filler songs like Five Magics and Poison Was The Cure, but otherwise Megadeth's strongest effort to date.  Things are coming together and evolving for the group and with Dave's sobriety, things can only get better...right?  A great leap forward.  Pictures of things to come.<br /><br />Dig it!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|\\"King Kong\\" is brilliant! The directing by Peter Jackson is brilliant and one of his best films since \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" series and outside of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" series! One of the best films of the year! Most of the crew that Jackson worked with for \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" series returns, as well. The screenplay by Jackson, Fran Walsh, & Phillippa Boyens (based on the story by Merian C. Cooper & Edgar Wallace) is brilliant! Naomi Watts (Ann Darrow), Jack Black (Carl Denham), and Adrian Brody (Jack Driscoll) lead an impressive cast in this very impressive film! Andy Serkis brings Kong impressively to life (he also plays Lumpy the Cook)! The music by James Newton Howard is impressive and brilliant! The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie is impressively brilliant! The film editing by Jamie Selkirk is excellent! The casting by Victoria Burrows, Daniel Hubbard, John Hubbard, & Liz Mullane is excellent! The production design by Grant Major is brilliantly impressive! The art direction by Simon Bright & Dan Hennah is brilliant and very impressive! The set decoration by Dan Hennah is impressive and very brilliant! The costume design by Terry Ryan is very brilliant! The make-up effects are very impressive! The Oscar-Winning visual effects by WETA Digital are very brilliant and very impressive! This is going to be an impressive Oscar contender for next year! Jackson has impressively remade \\"King Kong\\" (2005) with style and poise! This is one of the finest films of the year! Also won Oscars for Best Sound & Sound Editing.
B000002V0Q|5.0|After the huge leap from So Far, So Good...So What! to Rust In Peace, Megadeth came up with Countdown To Extinction...their masterpiece and one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.  There is not a bad song on this entire album.  Opening with Skin O' My Teeth, Extinction moves with a speed and a style that frame the entire makeup of Megadeth as a recognizable entity.  (In other words: their sound has been perfected to distinction).  Symphony Of Destruction is one of the best metal songs ever written!!! Architecture Of Aggression (say that fast a few dozen times) is fast and furious and totally addictive.  Foreclosure Of A Dream rules!  Sweating Bullets, a Megadeth staple, is revolutionary. If there are weak points to Extinction it is Psychotron & High Speed Dirt and these songs are not all that weak.  The title track absolutely rocks and Ashes In Your Mouth is a great ending to one of the truly great metal albums.  This is Megadeth's Master Of Puppets if you need a comparison with Dave's old bandmates, Metallica.  This is the pinnacle.  It can only go downhill from here.  Unreal effort.  I can never tire of listening to this.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I went in seeing Serenity without even knowing it came from the short lived series Firefly. The movie was great, the acting was superb and the storyline flowed nicely. The movie has alot of heart. I saw the movie review and thought it might be an interesting movie. In fact, I had to drag my boyfriend to see this movie since he usually only wants to watch the top selling  movies and when he came out he said it was one of the best movies we've seen in awhile. Better than the Star Wars and most of the other crap movies I've seen in 2005. This movie is the top movie I have seen besides March of the Penguins for 2005.  <br /> <br />I bought the series Firefly after I saw this movie. I hope they do make a sequel. Nathan Fillion and his cast are wonderful.
B000063DIH|4.0|After the heinous trash that was No Prayer For The Dying, Iron Maiden managed to put out a decent album before saying a fond farewell to frontman Bruce Dickinson.  With such cool songs as Afraid To Shoot Strangers, Fear Of The Dark & Be Quick Or Be Dead, Maiden was showing some signs of resurgence.  There is the usual amount of filler that has become the staple of Maiden albums for the past decade but it's reasonable instead of mildly retarded.  Here To Eternity is okay.  Weekend Warrior, Fear Is The Key & Judas Be My Guide are auto-pilot Iron Maiden.  This is truly the end of an era.  Dickinson will eventually return, but the year 2000 will have come and gone.<br /><br />Dig it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|american idiot is quite possibly the greatest album ever made. the political message is so inspirational with songs against george bush. their old stuff is nothing over this guys. and billie joe is a hottie and a genious. anyways, avoid all the other political crap like rage agains t the machine and the godawful system of a down. this is punk music at its best. \\"wake me up when september ends\\", \\"jesus of suburbia\\" and the almighty \\"boulevard of broken dreams\\" make this album what it is. greatest album ever. billie joe for president. you want to rebel and revolt and feel alive? listen to green day because of the great inspiration. best album ever ever made. luv ya billie joe.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica all the way back in 1983 and has been pissed off ever since.  He's like the modern day Pete Best (The Beatles' original drummer before Ringo jumped in, in case anyone didn't know).  Well, in Dave's rage, he decided to create the fastest, most obnoxious speed metal band ever.  He'd show those pukes in Metallica a thing ot two!  Megadeth is born!  Killing Is My Business was their debut.  Well...the fact that Dave Went back and cleaned up KIMB and made it sound a lot better goes far to remind us that this album is the gensis of one of the most successful speed metal bands ever (Metallica not included).  Killing Is My Business, like Kill 'Em All is a bit on the juvenile side, but the chops are there and there are riffs galore and Dave is dead set on letting us know that he is pissed off at the world.  Last Rites/Loved To Deth is a great into song.  The title track is based on the Marvel Comics character The Punisher.  Skull Beneath The Skin is great. Rattlehead rox!  The Mechanix is straight from Metallica's No Life 'Til Leather demo, sort of the alternate version of The Four Horsemen, bot songs were co-written by Mustaine.  Overall a better effort than most of the rest of thrash metals founders.  The remaster makes it shine just a little bit more than it originally did.  The version of These Boots is crap, go for the original on this song.  They edited it for some strange f*cking reason.  Otherwise, rock on.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000062YAZ|1.0|what is up with slayer. i get a headache every time I listen to this. you want heavy music, get good charlotte. as for these posers, the songs sound like my six year old brother wrote them. they suck. suck. suck. suck. suck. the lead singer thinks he's all tight and hard, he sucks. the drummer sucks. it sounds like he's banging on trash cans. all these bands like megadeth, pantera all are very bad music for maniacs. you want good music, get green days american idiot.
B000BGH22W|5.0|Before I saw the film, I was horrified as to how this wasn't going to be a John Williams score. But Patrick Doyle has done an excellent job here. My favourite tracks are 'The Story Continues', 'Harry in Winter', the delightful 'Potter Waltz' and the very intense 'Voldemort'. You will not be disappointed!
0143034901|2.0|I see so many rave reviews for this book and I just don't get it...I didn't like the book.  I recently struggled through 130 pages and quit.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't.  I found the drama contrived: for example, I would know that a scene was supposed to be suspensful (or sad, etc.) but it didn't feel suspensful (or sad, etc.).  The writing didn't transmit any feeling.  My match.com dating profile is a more compelling read.<br /><br />I found the characters flat; there wasn't a single character that I cared about.  The book just didn't seem to have any soul/meaning/purpose, if that makes any sense.  I prefer books with characters and storylines that have depth and meaning, and this book was definitely lacking.<br /><br />Maybe I'm a harsh critic.  I'm currently reading Midnight's Children by Rushdie, and it is incredible.  To compare, that's an example of 5 out of 5 stars (in my book).
B00000254Q|3.0|Santana has always had the amazing ability to change musical direction.  Amigos is a musical experience that's radically different from the brilliant Welcome album and the very good comeback Supernatural.   <br /> <br />Like other Santana albums in the 70s, Amigos combines a variety of musical styles--Latin, jazz fusion, disco, and funk.  Unfortunately, the variety of musical styles makes the album challenging to listen to if heard in full.  The songs do not mesh well together.  While I appreciate the combination of various musical styles in one song, going from Latin-flavored \\"Gitano\\" to the funky \\"Tell Me Are You Tired\\" makes the album disjointed. In comparison, Welcome's tracks blend well together.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, only one track truly stands out--\\"Dance Sister Dance\\", a classic eight minute epic that builds and builds in tempo and energy.  The song is one of my favorites of Santana and thankfully is on some of the group's greatest hits albums.   <br /> <br />A good second song of the album is \\"Take Me With You\\", whose first few seconds sound like background music to an episode of Arrested Development but like Dance Sister Dance is able to transition from Latin rock to a slow samba-like rhythm.  Regrettably, most of the other songs on the album are less memorable and certainly not classics.  The funky/choral \\"Let It Shine\\" and the discoish \\"Let Me\\" are repetitive and boring tracks, especially when compared to the brillance of Dance Sister Dance.  <br /> <br />Overall, the album lacks the genius of Welcome, but is a OK pick for the true Santana fan.
0307276902|5.0|Very Very GOOD BOOK!!!  I couldn't put it down and wanted more when the book was finished.  Once you get into the flow of the book it is impossible to put down.  There were parts that were difficult to read (very discriptive) but I believe it wouldn't  be as good of a book if it was missing those parts!  It is the true face of addiction...the good, the bad, and the ugly!  James Frey does an excellent job of bringing the reader into the book and making you feel as though you are there witnessing it all.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has dealt with addiction or had a family member dealing with addiction.  In fact I would highly recommend this book to anyone even interested in the ins and outs of addiction.  WONDERFUL READ!!!
B0000AM6LY|5.0|When I initially heard the song \\"Sunrise,\\" I initially wondered why Hall & Oates sounded so different and so fresh.  But upon further research, the Simply Red take on the melody of \\"I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)\\" not only convinced me to buy \\"Home\\" but made me a Simply Red fan.   <br /> <br />Like the similarly talented Tears For Fears, I never liked the early music of Simply Red.  However, each groups latest album (in the case of Tears For Fears, \\"Everybody Loves A Happy Ending\\") takes the 80s artists to a new high--breezy, wonderfully melodic and luxurious music that creates an album one can listen to in its entirety.  \\"Home\\" is that kind of album.  I was initially skeptical buying the album after only hearing \\"Sunrise,\\" but was blown away with its first track \\"Home,\\" then mesmorized by each subsequent track (although some of the songs start to get tiring after a few listens).   The CD is brilliantly produced, creating minimalist characteristics in which each instrument is easily heard and no singer or instrument is overstated.  Good speakers helps make the CD even better.  <br /> <br />The highlight of the album is \\"Sunrise,\\" a brilliant remake of the Hall and Oates hit \\"I Can't Go For That (No Can Do),\\" but tracks such as \\"Lost Weekend,\\" and \\"It's You\\" sound just as rich.  The album is simply warm and gorgeous in its harmonies and soft pop.   <br /> <br />While there are a few tracks I have gotten tired of--specifically Positively 4th Street, a remake of the Bob Dylan song, overall I have listened to this album repeatedly.  Its strongest songs are so good that I can overlook the one or two weak spots.  Lead singer Mick Hucknall and collaborator Gota Yashiki would do great justice by following Home with another album of similar beauty.  I'll be waiting patiently.
B0006399FS|5.0|I simply do not understand how this album's average rating has fallen so low. The rabid U2 fans are out in force complaining how this is over-commercialized pop? Well, I am a rabid U2 fan myself (I have *everything* they ever produced, including some live bootlegs) and I love this album. <br /> <br />There are a few things that you need to know (my subjective opinion which is shared by many other fans): <br /> <br />1. This album is clearly better than \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" (and arguably better than other prior albums) which means it's the best that U2 produced in a very very long time. <br /> <br />2. This album does not compare to \\"Achtung Baby\\", the pinnacle or U2's talent. However, this album is much more modern and listenable (especially if you are newbie) than most other U2 albums, which usually contain a few good songs and a few that are truly dated. I love those also, but it's an acquired taste. <br /> <br />3. Like U2's best, this album grows on you. Lush melodies, good lyrics. Plus, you have outstanding ballads like City of Blinding Lights, Miracle Drug, Yahweh, Fast Cars (UK only) in the true U2 tradition.  <br /> <br />It is amazing that U2 have had such a long and productive history that there fans from different time periods demanding a certain type of sound that is no longer relevant. It's kind of like the Rolling Stones diehards complaining how the new albums suck becase they are different from the good old stuff. Lighten up fellas! This is still one of the greatest bands in history, and they've produced another gem that outshines 99.999% of the rock/pop CDs published today. <br /> <br />In all fairness, I'd rate this album as 3.9 stars, but I needed to counter the one-star reviews :)
B0000CEB4V|5.0|How this concert slipped by me I'll never know. It would have been cool to see it in a theatre with a state of the art surround-sound system, but viewing it for the first time on DVD tonight was the next best thing I could've hoped for. There are 281 reviews ahead of mine, so I'll just add my own flourishes to what I'm sure has already been said: This is one of the masterpieces among concert films. Methinks George would be proud. There are highlights all the way THROUGH this fantastic 2-disc set, but the ones that remain in my mind a few hours after viewing it are: 1. The inclusion of Ravi & Anoushka Shankar (and Ravi's wife Sukanya, in a vocal cameo) & the performance of \\"Arpan,\\" the symphonic tribute to George with a small orchestra and vocalists. An AMAZING performance from start to finish. This one has particular meaning for me having seen Ravi & Anoushka and their fellow musicians last month in concert. George's love for Indian music was one of the things that endeared him to me, and his few forays into that musical realm in the recording studio were, without exception, astounding. 2. Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney performing \\"Something\\" together. What starts out as an acoustic piece with Paul on ukelele (which I wasn't at all sure I was going to like) evolves at the drop of a hat into the full studio version, with orchestra...and hearing Eric and Paul singing harmony on the middle 8 of the song genuinely moved me to tears...as did several other moments during this concert. There is no doubt that this concert packs one hell of an emotional wallop when you hear the QUALITY of the performances; everyone involved wanted to do his/her absolute best. And with very few exceptions, the renditions were nearly flawless. It's good that this set includes both the theatrical release and a disc of the full, unedited, from-start-to-finish concert, without the comments of the musicians interfering with the songs.<br /><br />I could go on, but you get the idea. If you loved George's music, beat a path to own, not rent, this DVD. It belongs in every music-lover's collection, every Beatles-lover's collection, every Harrison-lover's collection. It delivers & does not disappoint. Professionally-done with a minimal amount of sentimentality, Eric freely admits in one of the interview segments what I'm sure a lot of them were feeling...that a year after George's passing, the raw emotion of the grieving process was still going on and everyone involved missed him terribly. As do I.<br /><br />I can't agree with the one reviewer who felt violated that the Pythons were allowed to perform \\"Sit On My Face.\\" All who knew George knew that he had a wonderful sense of humor (anyone remember his \\"argument\\" with Lorne Michaels on Saturday Night Live regarding his payment for performing?); and besides, what better way to demonstrate the Yin & Yang principle than by following the Indian music performance with 4 of the Pythons mooning the Albert Hall crowd? I'll bet George was laughing along with everyone else.<br /><br />The one thing missing? OK, my ONLY gripe: With a talented group of Indian musicians onstage, as well as a fine-sounding string section, I was surprised and disappointed that the musicians did not choose to include George's Indian masterpiece, \\"Within You Without You.\\" To this day, 38 years later, WYWY remains my favorite Harrissong, and I'm dumbfounded why they all didn't jump on the chance to perform that song in concert. Maybe there wasn't enough rehearsal time available to perfect a live performance...I don't know. IMHO, it would have taken the overall beauty of the tribute and elevated it by light years. Ah well...at least we were treated to \\"The Inner Light.\\"<br /><br />At any rate: Buy it, watch it, enjoy it, revere it, treasure it. And thank you, Olivia, Dhani, Eric, and Ray Cooper for making it all possible.<br /><br />...and with Joe Brown (and his \\"uke\\") onstage with the entire entourage, singing a sweetly-rendered version of \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\"--and with another tear falling--we say goodnight to George.ther tear falling--we say goodnight to George.
0792165020|5.0|Someone else's. But not mine. Part of the problem with this well-written, well-directed, well-shot, well-cast and well-acted film, and the reason so many people hate it, seems to be that it contains not a single worthwhile or even moderately admirable or sympathetic  character. The story is vacuous and sick. It was just great when the shallow, selfish, useless Jude Law person, Dickie, got done in; and even better when the totally repellent Freddie collected his head. But we are asked to empathize with a text-book sociopath, who fits the clinical descriptions of the type to a T. The only real difference between Ripley, Freddie and Dickie is that Ripley is poor and the other two are rich. Empathizing with Ripley is like empathizing with Hitler --- no doubt he had reasons for what he did. The girls are both nice enough but basically wishy-washy social cyphers, the father is rigid, and the cops are either hopelessly stupid or hopelessly incompetent. The gay musician is creepy and wet beyond belief. Incidentally, the reason he has to be terminated, since one reviewer asked, is that Tom can't afford to have him blowing his cover with the second girl, whose name escapes me just now, and needs to masquerade as Greenleaf at least until the end of the voyage. Then he'll no doubt assume some new identity, since he thinks well on his feet. But it all adds up to more of a case-book study than an engaging drama, and a large proportion of viewers probably feel that they are just glad to be quit of the whole unedifying mess. Also, there is something about this icky tale that makes it easily forgettable. I watched it about 3 months ago, and when I came to watch it again I realised I'd forgotten everything about it: it invites mental erasure. The actors all do a great job.
B000002J03|5.0|This album is an earth shattering performance by musicians of the highest quality.  If you're not sure whether you like this band, it doesn't matter, you'll still love this album.  There is a level of energy here that is unsurpassed.  It can blow your speakers out.  When you put this one on you'll be looking at your CD player thinking it's about to explode.  The rhythm section of Bonham and John Paul Jones just seems to catapult the already stellar Jimmy Page into the stratosphere, and here Robert Plant is singing as a man possessed.  The thrill that you get when you first hear this album never wears off.
0307263118|5.0|Booker Prize-winning author John Banville presents a sensitive and remarkably complete character study of Max Morden, an art critic/writer from Ireland whose wife has just died of a lingering illness.  Seeking solace, Max has checked into the Cedars, a now-dilapidated guest house in the seaside village of Ballyless, where he and his family spent their summers when he was a child.  There he spent hours in the company of Chloe and Myles Grace, his constant companions. Images of foreboding suggest that some tragedy occurred while he was there, though the reader discovers only gradually what it might have been.  While at the Cedars, he contemplates the nature of life, love, and death, and our imperfect memories of these momentous events.<br /><br />As Max probes his recollections, he reveals his most intimate feelings, constantly questioning the accuracy of his memory, and juxtaposing his childhood memories with his recent memories of his wife Anna's \\"inappropriate\\" illness and her futile treatments.  Through flashbacks, he also introduces us to his earlier life with Anna and his fervent hopes that through her he could become someone more interesting.  \\"I was always a distinct no-one, whose fiercest wish was to be an indistinct someone,\\" he says, confessing that he saw her as \\"the fairground mirror in which all my distortions would be made straight.\\"<br /><br />More a meditation than a novel with a strong plot, The Sea brings Max to life (as limited as his life is), recreating his seemingly simple, yet often profound, thoughts in language which will startle the reader into recognition of their universality.  To some extent an everyman, Max speaks to the reader in uniquely intimate ways.  In breathtaking language, filled with emotional connotations, he captures nature in perfect images, often revealing life as a series of paintings--\\"a Tiepolo sky,\\" a hair-washing scene reminiscent of Duccio and Picasso.  He objectifies his thoughts about memory through Pierre Bonnard's many portraits of \\"Nude in the Bath,\\" paintings of Bonnard's wife in which she remains a young girl, even when she is seventy years old.  Images of the bath and the sea pervade the novel--cleansing, combined with the ebb and flow of life.<br /><br />Lovers of plot-based novels with snappy dialogue may find that the lack of external action and the novel's focus on the interior battles of an ordinary man of about sixty fail to engage their interest.  Other readers, who may have faced the deaths of family or friends and recognized the limitations of memory, however, may see in Max a kindred spirit to whom they respond with empathy.  I have rarely read such a short book so slowly--or reread with pleasure so many passages of extraordinary beauty and import--and I felt a connection with Max that I have never felt before in any of Banville's previous novels.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|While not many movies come along that allow you to suspend disbelief, the beginning of this millenium has allowed just that. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Narnia. My particular tastes run in the boat of giant fantastic creatures that menace others, with or without any logic. I don't know, maybe it's the sense of power that no human could possibly contend with. <br /> <br />Frankly, my opinion is very biased based on the fact that every review is such. I love King Kong, as I have since I first saw the remake of the 70's (actually saw that one first). In my view, most remakes of classic monster movies have depleted the sense of awe that the original had. Godzilla (got proof?) is a prime example. The original 1954 classic evoked fear of the war of the 40's due to reverance of the atomic age. Godzilla is that fear reborn in the form of a horrific creature. Roland Emmerich's version is, pardon the language, pussified by comparison. <br /> <br />Why does this version of Kong succeed where the American Godzilla failed? Simple. Roland Emmerich had no respect or love of the original vision that was Godzilla. Peter Jackson, however, did, does, and always will have this respect and love of the original Kong. <br /> <br />One more thing before I depart. That line of \\"'Twas beauty killed the beast\\" did not refer to Kong's attempts at winning Anne, but more to the idea that he would risk his own life in order to be with her and protect her. Carl Denham had no idea of Anne's like (or lack thereof) of Kong in this or the original version. He was, however, able to observe how obsessive Kong was to be with her. Anne is no different than how an animal trainer would act after significant time with Kong. There is no proof of Anne loving Kong, only that she pittied him and wanted to see him safe. <br /> <br />In my view, Anne was acting the way a trainer would if the animal trainer spent significant time trying to understand and sometimes teach a gorilla about certain things, onlyto see the gorilla being poched later. Just watch Gorilla's in the Mist to see my point.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I had a friend burn me this album. DO NOT BUY IT!!! The albums title track \\"American Idiot\\" is just a song to make them look like they have a message to send. There is no passion or meaning behind it. I am a drummer and this is one of the most boring albums in terms percussion. Almost every song has the same rythym from start to finish. The songs have repetive lyrics and the lead singer never changes his tone of voice. If you want a protest band with a purpose listen to System Of A Down. They have put meaning and depth into their music. Unlike these guys.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Guys, I love Korn, been with em since Life Is Peachy, have every cd and most of their singles, but their newest one isn't very good. And everyone talks about how they have evolved or w/e... I just don't think they got any more good music left in them. Yea they can put out a single or two off their newest stuff but the rest is just filler. Don't buy it, I'm still disappointed (broke my little twisted Korn loving heart to write this).
B000BVD460|1.0|When I 1st heard Em was putting together a greatest hits CD, it solidified the truth of him retiring. I thought this guy would go out with a bang... I WAS WRONG, the songs picked for this album where poorly choosen and arranged. FACK is just completely ridiculous! Since \\"Encore\\" Eminem has been rapping about NOTHING over semi hot DRE tracks. Why do we give him so much credit? It boggles my mind! Do not buy this CD if you are a fan of Eminem, cause you won't be once your done listening.

B000AP04NI|1.0|I had expected the 50th anniversary edition to be the DEFINITIVE release of Oklahoma, and had looked forward getting the Todd-AO version on DVD.  I should have saved my money. <br /> <br />The Todd-AO version looks absolutely HORRIBLE.  It's very, VERY soft, and perceptibly out-of-focus. What should be incredible detail shown by the Todd-AO lens is gone, and the picture is instead orders of magnitude softer than the CinemaScope version. <br /> <br />If you're buying this for the commentaries or for the CinemaScope version, go ahead, but if you're buying it for the Todd-AO version, please SAVE your money and instead write Fox and get them to re-release this properly remastered.  I would have thought they just sent the THX LaserDisc to the telecine, but even it had better color than the Todd-AO DVD does. <br /> <br />Sadly, even the special Todd-AO shorts are a bit fuzzy, but nowhere near as bad as the film itself. <br /> <br />As an aside, why in the heck would anyone do a documentary comparing CinemaScope and Todd-AO in 4:3, especially on an anamorphic DVD?!?!

B000AGTPUA|5.0|This movie is stunning; I'd had my doubts but, wow!!!  Its storytelling (though far from the original story--blame that on Hollywood) is superb, its musical choice amazing.  Perfect.  This is a contender to be a popular Christmas classic.

Probably, but what good writing is not? Most of our memories are probably romanticized but does that make them any less true or give them any less steely impact on the self?<br /><br />Frey bares not only his soul in these pages, but the pure wretchedness of his existence. The thing that wouldn't let go of me as I read this book was the reality of the sheer fortitude it must have taken for him to put all this down for the world to see. Who would ever expose themselves in such a way for the simple need of attention? Frey does not glamorize his actions, nor does he claim any glory for himself.<br /><br />The author sees nothing heroic in what he has done nor, truthfully, is there much. In fact, the most impressive thing about the author's transformation is not the controlling of his addiction but in the facing of his own anger and self-loathing. This is not a story of addiction as much as it is a story of a deep excavation into the very core of the self and the courage it takes to face the truths buried there. Frey's willingness to claw through the raw sewage of a past filled with at times evil, self-destructive behavior, wanton debauchery, and infinite anger, with no other goal than to reach the far side - a far side that is no sugar-coated \\"rich kid\\" paradise but a jail sentence and a future with nothing certain save for the horrifying reality that he can never afford to fail again - makes for compelling literature.<br /><br />This is a man who never blamed anyone but himself, and for me, that was a refreshing dose of responsibility in a world where we are mostly taught now that everything is someone else's fault.

B000000OQF|5.0|As I write this, I am 26 years old.  I have been listening to music for an extremely long time.  When I was in the 6th grade, a friend of mine got me into this album.  It would change my life forever.  As a person who grew up listening to rock and now who is interested in mostly jazz music, the evolution of my musical tastes has caused most rock to not age well.  I can still listen to some rock and metal albums non stop without ever getting bored though, and 'Appetite for Destruction' is the first album that comes to mind. <br /> <br />Guns 'n Roses go back to the town of Lafayette, Indiana, where Izzy Stradlin (rhythm guitar) and Axl Rose (a.k.a. Bill Bailey) (vocals) grew up as friends.  They didn't fit in well in Lafayette, though they did have another hometown friend named Shannon Hoon (vocalist from Blind Melon).  Rose and Stradlin moved to L.A. and when Axl got off the bus, there was a little black guy standing there and he said to Axl: \\"You know where you are?  You're in the jungle!\\" and these became the lyrics to the song \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\".  This early GNR material was written by a bunch of drunk bum rock musicians who lived the lifestyle of sex, drugs, and rock n roll - the lifestlye guys like me could only dream of.  Their experiences were then reflected in the songs.   <br /> <br />The rest of the band features Saul Hudson a.k.a. Slash on lead guitar, Duff McKagen on bass, and Steven 'Popcorn' Addler on drums.  Addler would later go on to suffer brain damage after a failed attempt at suicide after being kicked out of the band because he had a drug problem - and a drug problem by GNR standards is really bad!   <br /> <br />The sound on this record is raw - with roots in rock like Aerosmith and the Stones mixed with punk music like the Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, and The New York Dolls.  The main songwriters on the record are Axl and Izzy Stradlin and mixed with the amazing solos from Slash, this proves to be an album for the ages.  There's a song about heroin - \\"Mr. Brownstone.\\"  There's a song about sex - \\"Anything Goes.\\"  There's a song about getting wasted - \\"Nightrain.\\"  There's a song about cops - \\"Out to Get Me.\\"  Every single track is worth mentioning - 'It's So Easy,' 'Paradise City,' 'My Michelle' (another song about heroin), 'Think About You' (which is a good Stradlin tune), 'Sweet Child O'Mine' (which was written when Slash was just warming up in the studio one day), 'Rocket Queen', and 'You're Crazy' which would appear as an acoustic version on their LIES record. <br /> <br />The three big singles on this record were 'Welcome to the Jungle,' 'Paradise City,' and 'Sweet Child O'Mine' - the last one was written by Axl about his longtime girlfriend...who he abused.  This would happen again when he beat up Stephanie Seymour.  What an idiot.  That's what's so cool about Axl Rose - his immaturity is just a continued reflection of him sticking to that crazy lifestyle.   <br /> <br />I remember a time when I used to watch MTV and there would be at least one Guns video played every hour and sometimes more.  Do you?  If you're reading this review, and you don't own this, then please buy it.  Even if you're only going to purchase 2 or 3 rock albums in your life, make sure this is one of them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't actually need to add anything to the other reviews - it's all been said. <br /> <br />Except that I've been through all the episodes now - and I want more! Let's just hope that there either will be more movies or that someone will revive the series.
B00005JO04|3.0|Critics who suggest \\"Syriana\\" hopeless are probably right, but only if they understand one of the movie's last scenes, in which a young Arab steers toward a gala on the deck of an oil refinery with a bomb aboard his little dinghy. Writer/director Stephen Gaghan denies the audience the ensuing carnage of the explosion and, in a sense, the point of his polemic. Through several storylines Gaghan unravels a corrupt American government in collusion with corrupt American oil business to establish capitalist democracy in Iran for the sake of raping its economy while thwarting democracy in another Middle Eastern country because its reformist emir dares to sell his oil to the Chinese.  <br /> <br />\\"Syriana\\" does not lack hope for its depiction of this corrupt collusion, because Gaghan makes clear there is recourse against such corruption: The boy, with the bomb, on his dinghy will, as Tyler Durden scarily intones in \\"Fight Club,\\" reset things back to zero. The best way to thwart power, Gaghan argues implicitly, is to play by power's rules - stab it in the gut until it bleeds, and commit oneself to death. It worked in Vietnam. It gave America pause on 9/11. And, Gaghan argues, it's all that keeps the power brokers honest. If \\"Syriana\\" is hopeless, it's because it's nihilist, not because it's too angry to see through its tears.  <br /> <br />Gaghan - who won an Oscar for his adaptation of \\"Traffic\\" - is an insightful, talented guy. But he's made a movie too busy  - \\"complex\\" is word used by critics who agree with his rant and so pretend movies should resemble a first affirmative constructive in high school debate - to develop a heart for any of the characters nor peddle a thesis that wasn't covered in \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\"  <br /> <br />A CIA assassin named Bob, played by fattened George Clooney, generates the most press because he's played by fattened George Clooney. I personally could've cared less about how he's suddenly frozen out by his government, nor the plight of lawyerBennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) who's assigned to investigate the merger of one of his firm's clients, which lost oil rights to the Chinese, to a much smaller oil company, which unexpectedly gained rights in Russia. Is it is a corrupt merger? Does a ribeye steak taste good? <br /> <br />The only plot that seems new is that of an American energy analyst Bryan Wortman (Matt Damon) hired as lead consultant by Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) an Oxford/Georgetown scholar ready to drag his nation into the 21st Century by breaking the hold America has over his country's oil. His dying father only need name him emir over that hapless cad of a brother. Damon's analyst pulls no punches with his new client, partially because his son has accidentally died in the Prince's pool, and he thinks the job is a payoff - which it is. But the Prince really is prepared to heed his advisor's advice, to develop the economy, give women the right to vote, transform the region. Except that he sold oil to the Chinese. In a world of dwindling oil resources, your regular American Hummer owner can't afford that shortage in supply.  <br /> <br />Gaghan has something in this storyline, a kind of modern \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" Damon and Siddig establish immediate chemistry; Damon makes a great policy wonk looking for a guy to believe in, and Siddig broadcasts that dashing political brilliance Kennedy enjoyed. Nasir's cause is a decent one, his eventual fate we can mourn, and all the Gaghan's aims can be translated through his struggle.  <br /> <br />We get one-fourth of that movie. Gaghan is more committed to his narrative skills. Let it be said the movie has several compelling images: Bob meeting an informant at the sea in Lebanon, then later having his fingernails pulled out by this same man; remarkable displays of Arabian opulence; a shot of a beautiful Iranian woman slipping a birka over her sexy party clothes at sunrise; young Arab boys watching videos of \\"martyrs\\" describe their eventual funerals.  <br /> <br />In short, \\"Syriana\\" is best described as a wordy, preachy mood piece that seeks the reflect \\"the mood\\" or \\"the climate\\" or \\"the complexity\\" of the modern world, and to show off how much it knows about the tyranny of the few in majority. It's that guy you know who has an addendum for every news bit you saw on TV. Of course I admire it, and one wishes we all had two years to photograph beautiful Iranian women and stage a scene at that six-star hotel in Dubai while nominally in pursuit of the schematic that blows the lid off this cloaked universe of power. Gaghan will get applause from the critic crust but he fails to grasp what captivates Americans: You can interlock four stories about the moral complexities of assisted suicide; or you can make \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and close the picture with Saint Clint Eastwood eating key lime pie in a diner beside a box of Academy Awards. Americans like heroes, \\"Syriana\\" has none, and a story like this needs one.  <br /> <br />Because here's the deal: We're all paying through the nose for gas at the pump and Exxon recently reported record profits for last quarter. Is it corrupt? Is it corrupt? Can I pay eight bucks for the ribeye steak? What we need are personal stories, straight, tough, real, but personal. That, or the second coming of Howard Hughes - independently wealthy, bizarrely fixated on wind and solar power, and willing to tell oil executives to kiss both sides of his rump. Maybe he could date Amanda Peet, another perfectly gorgeous woman who is also in this movie. <br />

B000BBOUU4|2.0|\\"Charlie and Chocolate Factory\\" is a  expensive, creepy  film. It's perverse on a level kids may not get but does transmit to adults, who might wonder what director Tim Burton, and star Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, are getting at, exactly. It's dark, episodic and surprisingly unfunny, aiming for that demographic that enjoy watching episodes of \\"Maury\\" where the bad kids get sent to boot camp to get humiliated and browbeaten. <br /> <br />True, the book by Roald Dahl is not exactly a lark: Five children are invited to the reclusive Willy Wonka's massive confection factory after finding golden tickets inside their candy bar wrappers and four of them are ironically punished for their various bad habits.  One impoverished Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is polite and reserved during his visit, and thus rewarded for being the kind of child Dahl preferred: The saint. <br /> <br />Played by Highmore as a nice, shy boy, Charlie finds his golden ticket in the third Wonka chocolate bar he buys; he takes his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly in a diminished, useless role) to Wonka's factory just down the road. He's joined by lard German Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled English aristocrat Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and two competitive American punks, Violet Biodegrade (AnnaSophia Robb) and Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry). Gloop is a glutton, and the rest are grabby and annoying. But none of them know what to make of Willy Wonka, played by Depp as if he were channeling...someone very strange.  <br /> <br />Is it Michael Jackson? Vogue editor Anna Wintour? Jude Law's character in \\"Artificial Intelligence?\\" A John Malkovich villain? It's mannered and organic - clearly Depp had to rewrite some of this material toward his characterization - and a rallying point for the bad kids.  These brats don't much like anyone, but they have reason to suspect and loathe Willy.  <br /> <br /> So when Gloop, Mike, Veruca, Violet get theirs in Burton's vision, their calamities are presented straight awaywhile a bemused, detached, fey Depp looks on in his bob haircut. Burton also cloned one actor (Deep Roy) through CGI for all the Oompa Loompas, whose primary function is to perform dance numbers closely parroting 1970s songs most kids wouldn't know, the lyrics of which zoom by with such speed you don't know what the Oompas are singing about anyway.   <br /> <br />Burton never really brackets these numbers, or many of the scenes in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\\" The movie just unfurls, unaware of its own rhythm, unwilling to comment on anything except Willy's childhood (one of those classic Burton deals of a father isolating his son) that doesn't begin to explain Depp's behavior. He's Willy Weirdo, not Wonka, and that the movie made a pile of dough is not a tribute to its quality but marketing and a lack of audience taste.
B000BCE918|5.0|The Jurassic Park Trilogy[directed by Steven Speilberg] is and will always be THE most awesome dinosaur movies ever made.An undisputed masterpiece.

Most certainly fans will forever enjoy watching these super hits.I am fortunate to own the original Jurassic Park Trilogy,but these new releases are just perfect for fans of all ages to enjoy.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Let's get down to it: Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" is one jaw-dropping, gob smacking hour of amazing stuff sandwiched by two lesser segments, the first of which is a bit dull, while the latter a bit sentimental, mostly whiffing on the original film's visceral ending. But every second spent on Skull Island - from the landing on rocky cliffs, through the sunset to the capture of the giant ape -  pounds on the heart. When an adult who's seen more than 500 movies in a theater can still ask, with slight wonder, \\"There's more?\\" then Jackson has tapped into some vein of childhood that eluded him even in the \\"Lord of The Rings\\" trilogy. He's becoming the Babe Ruth of modern filmmaking, and his short porch in right field are all manners of beast and action. I'm more of a Ty Cobb/Roberto Clemente man myself, but you get the idea.  <br /> <br />The original \\"Kong\\" served as Jackson's Gatsby light, his muse and motivation, and his remake shoots for the moon, opening with a effective montage of Depression-era New York City before focusing on bit stage comedian Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts, just about perfect) a plucky girl struggling to eat, much less prosper. Soon she's out of a job, and on her way to a burlesque house, when she's discovered by Carl Denham (Jack Black) a filmmaker modeled after Orson Welles, although Denham (and Black, for that matter) has half the intelligence and pathos of that cinematic titan.  <br /> <br />Denham's really a minor hack of jungle films and second-rate romances in need of an actress to toss on a ship that will sail to a remote shoot. He sees Ann, correctly sizes her up as the saddest girl in New York, and convinces her to join the film by dropping the name of screenwriter/playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), on whom Ann has a crush - for his words, anyhow. They all board the tramp steamer Venture, nominally headed for Singapore - who knows how long, in the 1930s, that would take - but really going to Skull Island, supposedly uninhabited. <br /><br />The movie's first hour all buildup and backstory - Jack is trapped aboard the ship, makes sweet with Ann, while the crew of the Venture plans a mutiny against Denham. Jackson, frankly, is no Steven Spielberg with scenes like these; they're heavy-handed and overdone, and the director feels the need to use dumb camera-tricks and angles to underline mood and pass the time. Jackson and screenwriters Phillppa Boyens and Fran Walsh develop relationships that  never quite pay off, nor matter once Kong makes his appearance 90 minutes into the film.  <br /> <br />The ape, modeled after the movements of Andy \\"Gollum\\" Serkis,  is the star, the character with whom Ann, and the audience really falls in love. Made on a computer but as real as he can look - Aslan, in \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" is shamed by comparison - Kong is an giant, aging silverback on an island in constant Darwinian struggle: The beast must have to fight for his life daily. The toll shows, and Ann, once she is delivered to Kong by the possessed natives, is a calm gem in the midst of chaos. The crucial and best change that Jackson inserts into his movie is that Ann, already established as a great girl with pride but diminished self-esteem, sees something worthwhile in Kong, too. Watts, with those perpetually red-rimmed eyes, small mouth and uncertain voice, was born to sell Ann's transformation, and so this touch really works - when Ann is thrown into an environment that truly threatens her life, Kong does what nobody else has. He saves her.  <br /> <br />And the creatures he saves her from! There is a battle in \\"King Kong\\" you have to see to believe and enjoy, between Kong and dinosaurs, fought on several terrains - including vines - that is endlessly inventive, furious and downright cool. It just goes on and on, viciously and on a tightrope, Kong performing a violent dance equal to Jackie Chan or Jet Li. How'd they do it? Who cares! Incredible!  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the search party, including Denham and Driscoll, encounter their own monsters in a brontosaurus/raptor stampede. Later, in the scene that will make some in the audience crawl right out of their seats, they're trapped at the bottom of a canyon with giant insects, swamp slugs and crabs - another breathless sequence, and, frankly, I'd take my chances with the dinosaurs. Kong's capture, concocted by Denham, is epic and movie's saddest moment. \\"We'll all be millionaires,\\" he exclaims. After seeing such wonders, to be driven by dollars, Denham finally passes the rubicon of decency he's been walking beside the entire movie.  <br /> <br />The final set piece returns to New York, for the premiere of the beast and his eventual death atop the Empire State Building. The original \\"King Kong\\" had an advantage in that it doesn't have to bring emotional closure to Ann and Kong's relationship, whereas Jackson does; whereas the original shuts of the music and makes the final attack a merciless, unforgettable sound of biplanes and machine guns, Jackson jacks up the weeper meter. Is it a choice he's forced to make through his own skill of developing the earlier relationship? Maybe, but it denies him the raw, powerful ending that would have sent audiences out of theater with a jolt.   <br /> <br />Kong really is the star, but Watts makes a great damsel, distressed or not. She scolds Kong, even. She's tough, soulful, principled, a real cutie - Watts will make many a teen boy crush on her now, for the right movie and the right reasons. Brody is well cast because we aren't expecting Driscoll to be a hero, and Black reveals a previously unknown side, a kind of imprinted ruthlessness that show business breeds in a person. He crosses over here, like Jim Carrey has. The cast is rounded out by a motley, seasoned crew of actors, including Serkis as a dirty chef, Jamie Bell as the young shipmate, and Kyle Chandler as Ann's conceited co-star, Bruce Baxter.   <br /> <br />\\"King Kong\\" will get serious awards consideration, and deservedly so - its sentimentality is built for awards, and its period nature is akin to \\"Titanic.\\" It could do \\"Titanic\\" business, too, over the long run - its three-hour running time is only an obstacle once; after that, returning to the theater for it again is easy so long as you know that Cracker Jack prize lies in wait at Skull Island. The movie has enough heart for the ladies, every last special effect for the guys, and while flawed, it's never feeble. Jackson's movies really want it all, and the mere attempt is glorious; while Spielberg has graduated into statement films, the bushy fat guy's still with us eating our popcorn, noisy box candy and nachos on a cold night, in search of escape, adventure and meaning. Interesting that one character in reads \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" King Kong\\" reflects just the opposite. <br />
B00005JO04|1.0|Syriana was directed by Gaghan, the screenwriter for Traffic.  Though not a fan of that film at least you had Soderbergh's direction and could follow the plot lines.  Here we have so many  vignettes that (in spite of the tagline) are disconnected, you quickly lose interest.  There are no human characters to care about here.  There are torture scenes, terrorism scenes, sophisticated sounding lawsuit dialogue you can't make head or tail of.  George Clooney just finished a very good film, \\"Goodnight and Good Luck\\", and though this film gives him more onscreen time than others, it's still not enough to make us care about his character, a CIA pawn.  Matt Damon you care about even less in his role as oil liaison whose wife is only there to fill out the background.<br /><br />  Syriana utilizes a certain style of filmmaking, which some may like: shaky camerawork, convoluted dialogue, and fuzzy plotline.  I prefer human drama where you care about the characters.
0451450523|5.0|Peter S. Beagle finds a way to write a fairy tale in an age that finds fairy tales irrelevant.  The last unicorn, in her sad quest to discover what has happened to all other unicorns, is a symbol in a material age that hates symbol almost as much as it hates hope, truth and miracles.  And this hatred manifests itself in Beagle's story as the red bull that seeks to drive every unicorn into the sea.      In the same against-the-grain spirit, Beagle writes a lilting, lyrical prose filled with fresh striking images, almost the exact opposite of the pedestrian, matter-of-fact Hemingway style rife in modern American literature.  I'd recommend this book to everyone, especially to those who say they don't like fantasy because The Last Unicorn transcends the fantasy genre.
0307276902|5.0|I don't usually like Oprah's books, but I have to admit, I was hooked on this one from page 1. Warning: If you pick this one up, you won't be able to put it down!
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Master and Commander, The Far Side of the World, is the story of action and adventure, tough choices to be made, and a man's quest to end the threat of the high seas by any means necessary, whatever the cost may be. <br /> <br />Russel Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, known to his sailors and fellow ship officers as \\"Lucky\\" for his relative luck in the face of battle. One example would have to be a bank of fog that his ship retreats into after being ambushed by a french ship during the time of war. <br /> <br />The year is 1804, and France and England are at war as Napolean is conquering Europe one country after another. Only England's fleet of warships stands in Napoleans way of ruling the seas, so the tensions and battles at sea between different ships is at an all time high. Aubrey has been given the command to sink or capture a French ship named the Acheron, before it sinks any British ships. <br /> <br />The whole story isn't just about playing a cat and mouse game between Aubrey and the French captain. Aubrey's crew start to wonder if the French ship is some type of phantom ship after numerous sneak attacks lead them to question if there is a curse on one of the sailors, like the famous story of Jonah. Aubrey must keep control of the ship but at the same time he still needs time to keep the men happy at the same time. <br /> <br />There are also several other small stories in this movie, from the ship reaching the Galapagos islands and all the men looking at the strange creatures they never saw in their lives, to a storm at sea and a man being washed overboard, some great action scenes with just mother nature pounding on the ship. There's even a scene where the crew builds a floating device that reseambles a ship at nighttime to lure the french phantom ship away after yet another sneak attack. <br /> <br />We don't see much of the French crew during the movie, and 95% of the story takes place on the British ship. However you do see the respect Aubrey has for the French captain, and he is determined to prove he is better of the two during their chasing games back and forth as both ships manage to get behind the other during several ambush attacks. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, especially by Russel Crowe and the ship's doctor. The action scenes during the cannon fights and the climactic ending battle are well worth checking out. Emotional near the ending as men die for what they fought to protect, both on the French and British side. <br /> <br />The extras have: <br /> <br />Some behind the scenes shots of the movie and subtitles in English and Spanish. The ending of the story itself has a twist near the end, see if you can spot it before the characters in the story unveil the truth. Highly Reccomended.
0743454537|5.0|I thought this was a great book when I was reading it. By the time I finished it, I changed my mind and decided that it was an AMAZING book!
B00006L3S3|5.0|Released in 1973, just after the awful SOMETIME IN NEW YORK CITY / LIVE JAM, MIND GAMES was the first album John Lennon made during his Lost Weekend period.<br /><br />It's truly his best album after IMAGINE. It can even be considered as his best album because it's pure John Lennon, without the Phil Spector production.<br /><br />The title track is a great song and was a hit in 1973. TIGHT AS is a rock song just like CRIPPLED INSIDE was the rock song after IMAGINE on the IMAGINE album.<br /><br />AISAMUSEN is a touching song dedicated to Yoko where John says he's sorry. We can hear the demo version in the bonus tracks and we realize then that it wasn't supposed to be a message song to Yoko at the beginning, it's just a simple love song called I'LL EASE YOUR PAIN (even if the label still gives it the title AISAMUSEN).<br /><br />ONE DAY AT A TIME is one of the weakest tracks on the album but it was covered by Elton John in 1975. He must have thought it was a good song.<br /><br />BRING ON THE LUCIE is a little bit like GIVE PEACE A CHANCE with a lot of backup singers and a nice uptempo beat.<br /><br />NUTOPIAN lasts six seconds and it's supposed to be the anthem for a land Yoko and John imagined: Nutopia.<br /><br />INTUITION is not very good but it's nice and positive.<br /><br />OUT OF THE BLUE is one of the best songs on the album with MIND GAMES and AISAMUSEN. Once again, it's a love song for Yoko where John sings (or cries) Yoko came out of the blue to change his whole life that was falling apart.<br /><br />ONLY PEOPLE is an uptempo song. Once again, one of the weakest tracks.<br /><br />I KNOW seems like an apology to Paul for HOW DO YOU SLEEP. In 1973, Paul had released his masterpiece BAND ON THE RUN and even John said in the papers that it was a really great album.<br /><br />YOU ARE HERE is a nice song with a tropical mood (a little bit like MUCHO MUNGO if you know this song that Nilsson and John sang). One of the best songs here.<br /><br />MEAT CITY is the first true rock song on the album afetr TIGHT AS and it's a million times better. It's even better in its demo version at the end of this CD with John at home singing the song with his electric guitar.<br /><br />So if you want a good album by John Lennon, MIND GAMES is the best you can find after (or maybe before) IMAGINE.<br /><br />5***** stars without a doubt.'s a million times better. It's even better in its demo version at the end of this CD with John at home singing the song with his electric guitar. <br />So if you want a good album by John Lennon, MIND GAMES is the best you can find after (or maybe before) IMAGINE. <br />5***** stars without a doubt.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings affected me greatly when I first read it.  It has, over time, become my favorite novel, because of and in spite of its flaws.  Many of the 'flaws' as I perceive them happen in \\"The Two Towers,\\" which has the unfortunate distinction of being the \\"middle child\\" of the trilogy.  The story as written by Tolkien has no beginning or end, but overflows with \\"middle,\\" with some great exposition and action.  The same can be said for Peter Jackson's \\"The Two Towers,\\" as many of it's flaws are story related.  Like its literary namesake, the film has no real beginning, with the action beginning in Frodo Baggins' dream of Gandalf the wizard.  It also has no end, although there is definitely a rising of action and a climax, nicely capped by Sam's inspirational monologue.      \\"Towers\\" introduces us to the land of Rohan, home of the Rohirrim, a race of men who breed and raise the finest horses in all of Middle Earth.  Their King, Theoden, has been ensnared by the voice of Saruman, and his mind is not his own.  He is watched by Grima Wormtongue, an agent of Saruman, who feeds lies into Theoden's ear.  Theoden's nice, Eowyn, is overcome with grief for her uncle's loss, and her brother. Eomer, has been banished from Rohan for attempting to resist Grima's power.  Aragorn, the elf Legolas, and Gimli the dwarf all come to Rohan, seeing that it is taken by darkness and overcome with despair.  With the help of an old friend, they attempt to free Theoden and rally the Rohirrim.    Meanwhile, hobbits Merry and Pippin escape the clutches of the orcs and Uruk-Hai, only to meet a more mysterious creature.  Sam and Frodo have ensnared a tour guide as they trek closer to Mordor.  Faramir, brother of Boromir, crosses their path and discovers that they have the one ring and that they knew Boromir, whose corpse he saw in a dream.    The great parts of this movie are the introductions to new characters.  This initially seems daunting, as we already know of 12 or so characters tha are directly related to the story.  Karl Urban, only briefly seen as Eomer of Rohan, is very well cast and delivers a nice performance.  Bernard Hill is excellent as King Theoden.  Miranda Otto is tough but endearing as Eowyn.  Brad Dourif's Grima is nicely creepy.  The returning stars shine as well, especially Andy Serkis as Gollum (finally seen in full view), Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and Sean Astin as Sam.    The extended version gives some extra detail, including scenes of brothers Faramir and Boromir in flashback, extra battle scenes, and more of Grima Wormtongue's trickery.  As with the extended edition of Fellowship, the plot is enhanced by these added scenes.  Also similar to Fellowship, the battles may be too intense for youngsters.  On the whole, though, Jackson's unique vision and style , his excellent cast, the extraordinary effects, the stunning cinematography, the one of a kind prouction design, and Howard Shore's score make this a gem.  Final grade - A+
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Diana Krall sings the classics, she does not try like others to write a new classic Christmas song and it's fine like that. She delivers great versions of all the songs and gives us one of the best Christmas albums in the recent years by a major artist.<br /><br />She gives all the songs freshness although they are half a century old or maybe more and she sings them the way they are supposed to be sung with the jazz mood.<br /><br />Christmas is a special time of the year and it's great when a fine artist like Diana Krall brings all the songs back to their original form. It sounds fresh and new although we know all of them by heart.
B000000ZGO|5.0|This is the 1 that made Issac a name for the history of soul music. He is perscribe as \\"The Black Moses of Soul\\" 'cuz he can the change and invent how soul (R&B) music will be in the future. This was put out in the late '60s-early '70s IMO even his debut INTRODUCING or FEATURING ISSAC HAYES (I somewhat miss the entrance behind the title of the debut album), this features everything what the man, the powerfied Creator of Soul. All of his stuff he put out between the 'late 60s, 70s and now remains Sanctified Genius material. This cat known as the producer, writer, songwriter/lyricist, singer, musician, arranger, composer, instrumentalist, activist, speaker, etc. can do it all in 1 lick, 1 style, 1 album. I love all'a his entire work. He's truly one of my all-time favorite people in singing & songwriting, producing, playing, arranging, and composing ever since Bill Withers, Al Green, and Aretha Franklin. Also remains one of my childhood heroes overall. <br /> <br />Ok back to the album, while I was listening to this album on LP (not CD), I was feeling and notice some the varieties, flavors and sounds behind this record, for instance if listen to \\"Walk On By\\" (the original was once did by no other than music legend Dionne Warwick), u feel his growing, his emotion, his pain behind Issac's voice and behind him is a full live orchestra filled w/ strings, horns, really good vocals and plus a full live entire rhythm section. Oh love yea the entrance behind the guitar, the strings, kinda of it all, it's perfect and more relaxed, somewhat real and timeless. I actually feelin' this joint. Been listening to it and hearing it abundantly since day 1 (once I was little and growing up). Then on \\"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymystic\\" (what a tough name for a song, I somewhat can pronounce a lil more), it's more upbeat, more downside, really funky, more on the inside w/o being too dull and stuff. Can't say too much, but's it's tight and good. The piano solo is amazing and so as the organ solo on \\"Walk on By\\", among others. <br /> <br />There's not enuff info I can say bout this for side 2, but the rest of the song such as \\"By The Time I get to Phoenix\\" (I know this 1 by heart) and \\"1 Woman\\" is still growing. The Bar-Kays special guests on the full album, 'cuz they sound bad, I'm tellin' ya. I'ma real great fan to the man who did it, Isaac Hayes. This man is strong. Alot of hip-hoppers and R&B artists still dig his style and copied most of his grooves and rhythms and sampled them or duplicate them, in others words it's EVERYWHERE. <br /> <br />Love this whole album, it's real strong and real poetry. Truly a Must-Have, Must-Listen.
B00005JMX6|4.0|Yeah its a touch similar to Risky Business, but the plot is quite original. The classic tale, of a kid with a promising future who screws off and corrects his misdeed, while along the way banging a hottie, is more real than either of these movies--been there done that. <br />There are a number of really funny parts in this movie. <br />I can't remember any poorly delivered lines, so if there were any they were few and brief. The parents were kind of weak, but all the other main characters were great. <br />Elisha Cuthbert is so damned seductive!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Finally, someone came out with something fairly original in the fairy tale-cartoon genre.  Funny jokes for adults and kids.  Nice animation (check out the bloopers), plot moves along to keep everyone entertained.  Also check out the sequel.  Decent DVD package.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Having listened to Rod Stewart's first two albums of the American Songbook collection I have to say it was a little surprising that for the most part his performance, while certainly different, held its own. But I think that's where Rod should've left it. Certain songs he can sing and frankly on this album, he can't sing worth a damn. Being selective about his material would've helped, but with 4 cd's out there now with Rod singing the classics, it looks more like a box set and the desperate attempt of a has-been to keep his flagging career going when I fully agree with those that say he should retire. <br /> <br />
B00003CXMG|3.0|This is not a bad movie.  However, it gives a bit of a whitewashed view of rock and roll in the early 70s.  The band seems a little.... well, nice.    Crowe's version of groupie life seems a little sanitized. <br /> <br />Aside from that, not bad plot, not bad acting. <br />Probably worth a rental, but not sure if I would buy.  Perhaps for the ex-groupie on your list. <br />
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Ive heard pink floyds music but I'm not really a fan, and honestly this is my only pink floyd record, just saw this Item through a bargain sale. The moment I've finished listening to the whole tracks, tears flow down on my face, coz I think of the soldiers in Iraq,the children there, women dying, yes thousands of people there are still hoping for a post war dream.
B0001I561E|5.0|True, there are some alterations from the original version, but this is still a wonderful movie.  The voice acting definitely carries the movie.  The storyline is an old plot nicely augmented by Disney.  Bravo!
B0002XL35G|5.0|I have this DVD through a Christmas present, I just cant believe how painful this movie is, especially when Travis left in the ending parts. I keep asking myself why did he do that? and I think I'm not the only one who asks that question, I think the reason why he leaves after Jane was reunited with her son Hunter is that he thinks he's the one responsible why they are separated, so inorder to pay for his sins, he brings Jane back to Hunter.  <br /> <br />Ive seen this movie 7 times now, I just love the landscapes, the Immortal face of Harry Dean in the Desert, Robby Muller cinematography is perfect and so does Ry Cooder's sad guitar slides.
B00005JM02|5.0|Seriously, this beats the Incredibles any day, for the following reasons: <br /> <br />1.  Innovation with animation regarding water. <br /> <br />2.  Wonderful story line, well thought out.  Positive, adveturous but not too scary. <br /> <br />3.  Great voice acting. <br /> <br />4.  Horribly cute characters, kids love them!
0307276902|3.0|Mr. Frey's journey through addiction is illuminating in many ways.  Several of the scenarios in the book seem implausible & largely embellished, but drive home the ugly aspects of egocentrism & myopia characterizing an addict's behavior.  It also eloquently demonstrates that there are & should be a variety of approaches to overcoming substance abuse.  \\"12-step\\" most certainly is not for everyone.    Mr. Frey is not likeable & often acts rashly at the expense of others, but this behavior also demonstrates the complex nature of the addict's personna-both active & in remission.    Addendum:  Oooops!  Well, I now know that this was all a fraud, as I had sensed early on.  Shame on Frey.  He has done great damage to many.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Great fictionalized account of an American personality.  Cinematography is excellent.  Plot occasionally plods, but not too bad.  Acting is great.  You don't necessarily buy these movies for a history lesson.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I used to believe that this film, by the extraordinary Sidney Lumet, was the ugly kid sister to Dr. Strangelove.  But forty years later, it is this film that suddenly seems more fresh and pertinent, not because of the threat of nuclear holocaustic errors, but moreso because of the kind of leadership technologically oriented societies need.  Henry Fonda's president, who is never even called by his name in the film, embodies the type of leader we no longer have.  And that is what makes this movie more chilling and important than Kubrick's statement.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I would like to see this movie. When is it coming to Charlotte.  I don't understand why its not being released everywhere with the ratings its getting.  If anyone knows when its going to be released please let me know.  ant_empire@hotmail.com
B0002OERI0|1.0|ok i admit it i bought this album. i might as well have burned my money at that. Green Day was a good band, dookie will go down in history as one of the best albums of all times, insomniac was also a great one (brainstew being the strong hold), when i heard warning i actually did like it but i could see the chain of events happening. Green Day was shifting from Punk to Pop punk. This album though brakes my respect for them. American Idiot is them enjoying their mainstreamity. i mean how can you consider this punk BVLD of broken dreams! wake me up when september end!? WHAT! what happened to piss everyone off green day, push the limits green day brain stew, basket case, greenday, what happened to I WANNA BE A MINORITY GREEN DAY. the only song that causes controversy is American Idiot (by the way sux) they may have gained many new preppie pop fans but they've certainly lost most of their real fans. By the way for all you true greenday fans i threw this album away, if you've bought this album i suggest you do the same. DONT BUY THIS ALBUM
B000002UA5|4.0|Ummagumma is a very odd floyd album. Although it is not a very popular Pink Floyd album it should not be overlooked. If u are a serious Pink Floyd fan and need some different floyd stuff to listen to this is a great album for you. If you don,t like psychidelic music this is probly not a good choice. But it is a fine piece of music. <br />
0399152717|4.0|Kurt Austin is back in the latest installment by Clive Cussler and Paul Kemprecos...  Polar Shift.  It's a nice \\"mind candy\\" bit of diversion...<br /><br />Austin and the NUMA crew are once again pulled into breaking up a plot that threatens to destroy the earth.  A group of anarchists (well-funded ones) have discovered a way to force a polar shift of the magnetic north and south pole.  By doing so, they hope to destroy the world's navigation and communication infrastructure, allowing their heavily shielded replacements to survive as the only game in town.  The only thing that can stop them is a young woman who is the granddaughter of the original scientist who learned about the shift decades.  She doesn't know that she holds the key to reversing the polarity, but NUMA and Austin have to find her before the others get there first...<br /><br />I didn't expect blockbuster material here, just a fun read.  And basically that's what I got.  The Austin series isn't quite as frenetic a pace as the Dirk Pitt series, nor is the dialog between Austin and his sidekick quite as entertaining.  Still, it was a book I enjoyed picking up each evening before I went to bed.  I'm not sure I would have wanted to pay $27 for it, but as a library book it was fine.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I saw the video for Welcome to Jamrock and was hooked. Then to see Damian and Bobby Brown laying the track for beautiful on a rerun of 'Being Brown Brown'. I had to purchase. I listen to a variety of different music and never purchased a reggae album.  <br /> <br />THIS IS BY FAR THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR. IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LISTENER THIS CD IS FOR YOU. YOU WILL ENJOY EVERY TRACK FOR  DIFFERENT REASONS.
B00005JO1P|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix has come a long way since playing the mixed up porn toting child of divorce in \\"Parenthood\\" (watch him in \\"Quills\\"). He has nailed the part of Johnny Cash and, quite feasibly, an Oscar.<br /><br />Rather than try and cram his entire life in under 2 hours, WTL focuses instead on Johnny's early life (dysfunctional alcoholic father, tragic death of his beloved older brother Jack) and the gospel music his mother taught him. After joining the Air Force and eventually returning from Germany, Johnny marries Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin)and quickly has his first child. But Johnny can't make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. After seeing Elvis through the back door of a local recording studio, Johnny gets the idea to form his own band and make a record- and the rest of his career is history.<br /><br />Oddly enough, this film isn't as much about Cash's career as it is a beautiful love story between him and June Carter, played superbly by Reese Witherspoon. From a nearly decade long addiction to ampetamines to a bitter divorce from Vivian, Cash survives it all and pursues June single mindedly until the refusals to his marriage proposals become an acceptance. It's no wonder Cash died just three months after his beloved June passed away- their connection ran deeper than friendship or marriage- they truly were soulmates. A stellar cast and a superb script make \\"Walk the Line\\" one to watch at Oscar time.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What's left to say?  There's no need to recount the plot line; it's by now almost as well known as that from the other great love story of the season, King Kong.  There's also no need to rave about Ang Lee's talent or taste; that was clear well before Brokeback ever came along.  But here's three things I can say:  first, this is not a gay movie.  It is a memorable, life-long, and very sad love story of two people who just happen to both be boys and then men.  Second, appreciation for Heath Ledger's work in portraying Ennis, the more conflicted of the two, only grows when one leaves the theater.  In every move he makes on screen, he gets the personal cost to Ennis of living with what cannot be -- as he says at one point -- \\"fixed\\" exactly right.  Even Jack, with his own conflicts, does not understand that cost, but thanks to Ledger's acting, the audience can.  Third, in a movie filled with affecting scenes, I'm not sure there is a more powerful one than the last, when Ennis folds up the left-behind sweater of his daughter, the other great love of his life and the consolation for not having made his life with Jack, and places it on his closet shelf near their bloodied, twinned shirts from the summer on Brokeback Mountain.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is some of the best music I've heard in a while. The song-writing is consistently good from song to song and the lyrics are clever and catchy. <br />I came across DCFC, like many people, via Ben Gibbard's side project, the Postal Service. I was impressed with their last album, Transatlanticism (mostly tracks like Title and Registration and The Sound of Settling), but nothing prepared me for Plans. <br />After hearing its first single, Soul Meets Body, I immediately went out and bought this album. I was pleased to find that it lived up to all my expectations- and then some! <br />Highlights: <br />Soul Meets Body- The first single I heard. I've probably heard this song 50 times now but it's still great. <br />Different Names For The Same Thing- This one grew on me. Someone told me that it sounds like a John Lennon song, and I agree. <br />I Will Follow You Into The Dark- A very sad, very beautiful song. <br />Crooked Teeth- The most upbeat song on this album. It has great guitar and bass. <br />Brothers On A Hotel Bed- This one took some time to grow on me, but now it's one of my favortites. The piano/organ melody is great and I think that this song has the album's best lyrics. <br /> <br />All in all, a wonderful album. I strongly recommend it.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|In order to get myself in the mood for this new version of Kong I decided to watch the original one again, just to get into the spirit of things. Part of me, now after seeing this movie, wishes I hadn't and part of me is glad I did.<br /><br /> I'm glad I did because now I can comment more accurately on this film's strenghts and weaknesses. I'm not glad I did for exactly the same reasons. I don't want to compare and contrast the two movies. I wanted to either love or hate this version of Kong on its own merits. I'll try my best to do just that.<br /><br /> There is good news and bad news with this movie that is surprisingly getting a wonderful reaction from critics and the public. Roger Ebert, The New York Post, and The New York Daily News have all given the movie four stars! The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune also wrote favorably reviews. And as far as public reaction goes just check the average star rating here on amazon.<br /><br /> But I'm not convinced this is a great movie. First of all I never thought the original was a great movie. A great piece of filmmaking? You bet! If for any reason its innovation in the genre. It practically created it. For that you have to give the original credit. But a great movie? No. An entertaining, exciting ride? Sure. That is more or less (mostly less) how I feel about Peter Jackson's remake.<br /><br /> I'll start things off with the good news. This new version helps us understand Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a bit more. The original never really dwelled too much on the character, which is a shame. There were a lot of possibilities to play around with it. This new version also shows audiences the grim realities of the times. I suspect this was done largely because the audience that goes to see this film will mostly be children. At least this was the case in the theatre I attended. And finally obviously the production value on this film is greater than the original. Much more money was put into making King Kong look more realistic. If there was such a thing as a 20, 25 foot gorilla I suppose this is what it would look it. Although this is not necessarily a good thing. I always felt the original Kong, even though you could argue looked fake, had a certain amount of charm to it. It actually worked with the whole fantasy idea behind the movie.<br /><br /> I also liked the references to the original. There is a funny line of dialogue (well at least I found it funny, no one else in the theatre did) between Carl Denham (Jack Black) the director and his assisant, Preston (Colin Hanks) when discussing who they can get to star in the movie. Preston names people such as Myrna Loy and Mae West and soon Carl says what about Fay. But Preston informs him she's doing something for RKO to which Carl says in disgust, probably with Cooper. The reference relates to Fay Wray, Merian C. Cooper (director of the original Kong) and RKO, the studio where the film was made.<br /><br /> There is also a scene when we see them shooting the movie within the movie, the dialogue is actually taken from the original.<br /><br /> Now comes the bad news. The thing that bothered me most about this movie was the relationship between Darrow and Kong. In a word it's creepy. And when I say creepy I mean creepy. Ann actually starts to feel compassion towards the beast. She actually gets mad at the people trying to protect her from it. She stands in front of them and cries out \\"No!!\\" Is she fcuking nuts!<br /><br /> In 1933 when Fay Wray was captured by Kong and taken atop the Empire State Building we sensed fear. I'm here to write Fay has nothing to be ashamed of. Fear is a perfectly rational reaction when you are in the grips of a giant gorilla. I probably would have wet myself. But here when Ann is captured she tells Kong he's beautiful! Jackson is actually trying to milk these scenes for romance. They are taking this far too serious. And for me this ruins a bit of the movie and lessens Watts' performance. Her reaction is not normal. I understand movies are suppose to be the stuff of make believe, but this is taking things a bit too far. I'll accept there is such a beast as Kong. I'll accept there is an island with dinosaurs running around. And I'd accept the fact that some director would want to get this all on film. But I'm sorry, I can't accept a woman falling in love with a monkey, a real monkey! There is even a scene where they go ice skating. Are you people reading this!?<br /><br /> I also felt the movie over stays its welcome. It is three hours long. The original was an hour and a half. That felt a bit too short. The movie should have been about two hours. The reason this movie runs so long is because it is flooded with action scenes. Some work and truly kept me on the edge of my seat, a scene with Ann, Kong and some dinosaurs, but a lot of them just started to bore me. There were too many and they didn't help advance the plot. The original smartly knew this and limited much of these scenes.<br /><br /> Then there is the acting. I don't really have a problem with many of the people in this movie except for Jack Black. He's not able to deliver the movie's famous lines correctly. Sometimes he says them in such a bland way they lose all meaning and other times he's going overboard. In the end he was just a bad choice for the character.<br /><br /> But back to the romance. This romance destroys all meaning of the film's famous last line, \\"it was beauty killed the beast.\\" In the original it made sense because Ann was afraid of Kong. So in a way Kong had to prove myself to Ann. He had to show her he loved her and in doing so he died. There it really was a case of beauty killing the beast. In this movie he already won the girl! She actually, I think, prefers his company over Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody) the movie within the movie's screenwriter. In this verison of Kong, no it wasn't beauty killed the beast it was defintely the planes that got him.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: At times enjoyable and disappointing remake of the 1933 film. Jackson does improve upon certain elements but I found myself turned off by the cheesy romance and the character development.ake believe, but this is taking things a bit too far. I'll accept there is such a beast as Kong. I'll accept there is an island with dinosaurs running around. And I'd accept the fact that some director would want to get this all on film. But I'm sorry, I can't accept a woman falling in love with a monkey, a real monkey! There is even a scene where they go ice skating. Are you people reading this!?     I also felt the movie over stays its welcome. It is three hours long. The original was an hour and a half. That felt a bit too short. The movie should have been about two hours. The reason this movie runs so long is because it is flooded with action scenes. Some work and truly kept me on the edge of my seat, a scene with Ann, Kong and some dinosaurs, but a lot of them just started to bore me. There were too many and they didn't help advance the plot. The original smartly knew this and limited much of these scenes.      Then there is the acting. I don't really have a problem with many of the people in this movie except for Jack Black. He's not able to deliver the movie's famous lines correctly. Sometimes he says them in such a bland way they lose all meaning and other times he's going overboard. In the end he was just a bad choice for the character.     But back to the romance. This romance destroys all meaning of the film's famous last line, \\"it was beauty killed the beast.\\" In the original it made sense because Ann was afraid of Kong. So in a way Kong had to prove myself to Ann. He had to show her he loved her and in doing so he died. There it really was a case of beauty killing the beast. In this movie he already won the girl! She actually, I think, prefers his company over Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody) the movie within the movie's screenwriter. In this verison of Kong, no it wasn't beauty killed the beast it was defintely the planes that got him.     Bottom-line: At times enjoyable and disappointing remake of the 1933 film.

B00005JO1Y|1.0|No Titanic People been comparing this movie to Titanic Not even in the same life boat as Titanic.  No pun intended...  This Movie was a drag.  I found myself looking at my watch every fifteen minutes.  As I notice and hour and Ten minutes went by with no signs of King Kong yet.  Save your money and time.  Not worth it at all!!!  The story line nearly hold your attention.  The acting all good but for Jack Black with every scene same impression on his face.  You could see the roll was a stretch for him better stick to Comedy  and stay out of Action/Adventure films.  The digital effects were not that good at all.  New York City looked like a big model set with cars.  Not to Impressive of the times.  In fact the 1976 King Kong to me was more realistic and had better effects.
0385610319|4.0|When I picked up the book...something about the colour of the stripes, something about the hue of the colours looked familiar...in a morbid way...and I wasn't sure if I'd want to read it. What intrigued me as well though, was that within the jacket of the book, it said basically that they could not give us an idea of what the novel was about... <br /> <br />I understand why. There SHOULD NOT be a synopsis on this book because you'd regret reading one. If by the first two sentences in Chapter 4 (they're VERY short chapters) you don't know what the novel is about, I'd be surprised. The story that follows needs no description as you are being dragged deeper gradually,  even though wondering all the while, \\"ermm...and so...?\\" <br /> <br />This novel is indeed about a nine-year-old boy who walks up to a fence. Boyne writes using a voice with an air of innocence that successfully works to punctuate the harsh reality of the \\"situation/predicament\\" which is, essentially, what the story is. The ending will send you rereading the last part of the book again, and perhaps again. I read this book in one sitting. Once you've finished...you will be thinking about this one for a while...
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I haven't seen a movie this good in a very long time.  I wasn't very sure if I would like it or not, due to the massive amounts of CGI effects and all, but then I remembered that Peter Jackson was directing it.  Peter Jackson is my favorite director, mainly because of his earliest movies...splatter flicks with jaw-dropping amounts of gore (Dead Alive, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, etc...). So me and my best friend went to see King Kong, and I have to say that I was amazed.  All the CGI was so convincing. You really couldn't tell what was fake and what wasn't.   <br /> <br />The near two hours they spent on Skull Island was my favorite part.  The scenery was so beautiful, yet it was very unsettling. When we first see Skull Island, we are greeted by a large group of cannibalistic natives, which are actually pretty scary to say the least. If you've seen the original 1933 version, then I shouldn't need to explain the rest to you. But let me tell you, Peter Jackson made it much, much better by adding on to the original story. The high points in the film are as follows: <br /> <br />-When Kong fights the gang of T-Rex's, it's unbelievable to say the least. <br />-The brontosaurus stampede was amazing and it made me want to jump up and scream. It was a very claustrophobic moment in  the film. <br />-When they are down in the pit with all of those mutated looking centipedes and huge grasshopper looking insects, it's VERY unsettling and highly entertaining at the same time. I was laughing at them when the bugs kept crawling up on them and they would say \\"Get it off!\\" It was great. <br />-And of course, the legendary scene where Kong carries the woman up the Empire State Building.  At the end of this scene, lots of people in the theatre were crying, and rightfully so.  <br /> <br />The casting was also great.  Naomi Watts and Jack Black were outstanding.  They did an amazing job with this movie. <br /> <br />I hope everyone gets the chance to go see this.  It's a masterpiece.I can't say that it surpasses the original, but it still must be one of the greatest movies from the past 10 or 20 years.  I hope to see a great collectors edition DVD within the next few months, because I know I will be purchasing it.
B000001ESF|3.0|As everyone knows, this is Rush's \\"breakout\\" album. There's some pretty good, original rock music on it. Other reviewers will have exhausted themselves annotating each of the ideological formulae drummer/lyricist Neil Peart unleashed in the title track -- the lot of which could, unfortunately, be summed up with the words \\"derivative bathos\\".     Credit where it is due: after the failure of the audacious and unutterbly dorky \\"Caress of Steel\\" (if you can listen to the narrator in \\"The Necromancer\\" with a straight face you're more of a man than I) Rush were yet undaunted enough to try out another epic-length imposition on the attention-spans of pimply, philosophy-starved adolescents everywhere. The result, which made them wealthy men, was a heavy metal situation-tragedy about cherished enlightenment ideals getting pulverized in a futurist, statist dystopia. Think of it as \\"1984\\", plus 128. The incredible thing is, Rush appeared to mean it, at least in part, as a commentary on the music industry's recent under-appreciation of \\"Caress of Steel\\". So, one or two layers of irony there.     In short, there are two kinds of people:     (1) those who think rock musicians should probably never have started taking themselves very seriously (one would have thought the Moody Blues had put that notion to bed) and who probably spotted the curious yet unmistakeable goofy-streak in the members of Rush before many of their most credulous fans did (is that REALLY Tchaikovsky's \\"1812\\" overture popping up in the overture to \\"2112\\"?); and     (2) those who think Neil Peart is rock-and-roll's answer to the Immortal Bard.     But hey, at the time (1976) this seemed like a pretty cool album. If nothing else it introduced us to the concept of the interplanetary P.A. system.    Minstrels unite! Fight the Solar Federation! Don't let them take away your vibrating-wire devices that give forth music when you touch them!
B000BC8TBE|5.0|This re-release was put out by Mariah's ex label Sony. Maybe they are cashing in on her success with Universal, but for those who are MC collectors, or don't own this album, you will definitely enjoy this one. Infectious upbeat numbers like Santa Clause is coming to town (the Phil Spector version), Joy to the world (mixing the three dog night song with the trad one) alongside traditional carols celebrating the birth of Christ (O holy night) are beautifully placed alongside new compositions that celebrate the birth of Christ too, as well as the importance of love at this time. Two bonus tracks are included on this release, God rest ye merry gentlemen (included on the original Australian release), and a remix of Santa Clause is coming to town. The original music videos - alongside animated videos and live performances are also included. All I want for Christmas is you - a MC original,  is now enshrined as a classic in the cannon of holiday music. Pop, Gospel and Dance fuse to make a cohesive, fun and very spiritual release - Bless you MC.
B000001ESJ|4.0|You have to hand it to Rush: they weren't gonna use the recent success of \\"2112\\" to go more mainstream.     \\"Xanadu\\"? \\"Cygnus X-1\\"?? What were these dudes handing around when they came up with \\"Cygnus X-1\\"?     Altogether, we have maybe the ballsiest salute to unabashed, D&D-inspired Nerdhood ever conceived, rehearsed to unlikely precision, and jammed to the +4 magic-sword hilt. Well, that's at least until you go back to their earlier albums and uncover even *nerdier* material -- \\"The Necromancer\\"? \\"Rivendell\\"? \\"By-tor & the Snowdog\\"?? (By-tor? Don't ask...) Anyway it's a good thing most of it friggin' rocks, man, or I'd be too busy laughing hysterically.     If you're not old enough to have outgrown Neil Peart's jejune poetry, you'll probably award this five stars and play it repeatedly, as I may or may not have done at that age. How about four stars for fearlessly different song-writing, good melodies/riffs and tight musicianship. Painfully nerdy, yes; but \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" at least stood out in a sea of popular mediocrity and selloutry. Yeah, well, so did the Village People, huh.    So shoulder your lute, light one up and enjoy. (Watch out for that black hole, though.) Let's call this Rush's best album -- it's short, it's trippy, it's musically interesting, it's not ridiculously grandiose like \\"2112\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\", and it's not a totally synthed-out, preachified wankfest like most of their later stuff.
0393317552|4.0|\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" certainly makes for good reading. I was turned off however by Diamond's relentless attack on the notion that one race may be intellectually superior to another. Sure enough, to my knowledge, there has never been any serious research that has conclusively come down on one side or the other. But because of that, I believe we are entitled to opinions on the subject, but Diamond would want only one opinion, and that is: all the races are equal in their intellect. This dogmatism lowers somewhat the stature of the book.

B0000028MA|5.0|Soundtracks never meant a lot to me. In fact, prior to buying this, I had never even taken the time to listen to one completely because I would get so frustrated with the choices so early in the CD. When my interest in 90s grunge was peaking is when I found the Singles soundtrack. My obsession with grunge has since diminished a tad bit but I still find myself listening to this all the time even though I've had it for a long time. From Alice In Chains' dark anthem Would? to The Lovemongers very good take on the Zeppelin classic Battle Of Evermore, I'm hardpressed to think of a soundtrack that delivers like this one does.<br /><br />Alice In Chains' Would? is still one of my favorites by them. Layne Staley has always had a great voice and I think that song shows it very well. Pearl Jam's Breath is classic PJ in every way. It's got fantastic vocals, a great guitar solo, basically everything that makes you like PJ. Chris Cornell's Seasons is just a gorgeous track. If you like his voice, there's no way you won't like this song. Paul Westerberg's Dyslexic Heart seems a bit out of place to me, it's lumped in between two songs that aren't upbeat or poppy but then you have this. Dyslexic Heart is a good song but it's poor placement. The Lovemongers' Battle Of Evermore has become one of my favorite songs featured for the sole fact that they did such a great job with it. I first heard Mother Love Bone's Chloe Dancer/Crown Of Thorns when it was covered by Pearl Jam. PJ did such a good job that I figured the original must be excellent, and it really is. Soundgarden's Birth Ritual shows Soundgarden at their best and that's really all you can say. PJ's State Of Love And Trust is another classic PJ track that any fan knows by heart. Mudhoney's Overblown is pretty good, though I'll admit that it's not the best on here. Paul Westerberg's second entry on here, Waiting For Somebody, is just like his first, very upbeat. If you liked Dyslexic Heart you'll like this. Jimi Hendrix is someone I've never been a big fan of but this song, May This Be Love, is actually pretty good. Screaming Trees' Nearly Lost You is definitely a highlight, and the Smashing Pumpkins' Drown is a song any fan of them surely loves.<br /><br />All in all my favorite songs are Would?, Breath, Battle Of Evermore, Birth Ritual, and Drown. Pretty much, if you like 90s rock you'll enjoy this. In my opinion though, this is sure to go down as the best soundtrack I've ever heard.eone I've never been a big fan of but this song, May This Be Love, is actually pretty good.

Anyone who doesn't like it is mostly pointing out stupid irrelevant things that the average viewer will not notice. This movie will reach you, and make you feel in a way that movies generally don't. They definitely don't make movies lik this anymore. This is movie making AT ITS BEST. Do not miss this movie!!!

B000AP04EW|2.0|Two bankable stars. One, beautiful, with full pouty lips, and the other one, Angela Jolie. And, yet, the movie she and Brad Pitt made together just didn't click. Once again, a director, Doug Liman in this case, takes a so-so script with high-budget stars and covers up its failiings with lots of explosions, gun fire, car chases, and dead bodies by the score. The banter between Brad and Angela was contrived and only occasionally witty. The fight scenes were utterly fake and the ending was straight out of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but with less realism. Fortunately, I went into this movie with low expectations and, much to my relief, they were met.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Peter Jackson's passionate remake of \\"King Kong,\\" is deeply mesmorising and profoundly beautiful, capturing and signifying many of the themes that the original failed to execute to the fullest. There were two things that I was sure about when going into this film; firstly that Peter Jackson, being a devoted fan of the original would honour it through his brilliant film-making abilities;, and secondly, that it would NOT be his finest achievement. <br /> <br />A phenomenon like \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" Jackson's critically- acclaimed, and multi-Oscar-honoured masterpiece, only comes round once in a blue moon, so I knew before watching it that \\"King Kong,\\" would not surpass such perfection. I think this is where \\"King Kong,\\" perhaps hasn't been given the full credit it deserves. It will forever lie in the shadow, and therefore always be compared to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" <br /> <br />But Jackson's remake of \\"King Kong,\\" IS successful in one monumental way, in that it finally puts the term \\"movie remake,\\" in an honourable perspective. The flaw with director's trying to literally REMAKE an old classic, is that the new, technilogically-advanced version will try and be BETTER than the original. To me however, the remake of a film as iconic as \\"King Kong,\\" should be done so the next generation has the opportunity to appreciate why the original was so adored in the first place. <br /> <br />And this is where Jackson REALLY succeeds. With care, this film is visually, musically, and emotionally charged, allowing audiences to not only appreciate it as one film, but appreicate the original's profound beauty. I liked Naomi Watts' portrayal of Anne Darrow. She has the ability to transport messages and feelings through her expressive eyes. The idea of emotion through eyes is one the main aspects of the film, as King Kong himself is projected through his incredible expressions (accentuated by the genius that is Andy Serkis of \\"LOTR's\\" Gollum fame). I loved the chemistry between Anne and Jack (Adrien Brody), whose relationship is romantic and tranquil. Their scene on top of the Empire State building was a part I found particularly lovely. <br /> <br />The idea that Kong falls in love with Anne is one of the themes that this version signifies clearer than the original. In the original, the theme is implied but not, in my opinion, properly executed. Peter Jackson takes special care to build up their bond, making their heartbreaking final minutes on top of the Empire State all the more tragic. In turn, it also emphasises the film's infamous central idea; \\"It wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the Beast.\\" Essentially, Kong loved Anne so much, that he sacraficed himself. In my view, this film couldn't have done a finer job in honouring this theme. <br /> <br />The other successes of this film is its technical and musical attributes. The special effects are sublime, and truly state-of-the-art. They say the only way to bring New York to the screen is to film New York itself. But Jackson's virtual New York City had a certain athereal quality to it. The creation of Kong himself is revolutionary and visual effects Oscar the film garnered was more than deserved. May I also add that this film won 3 out of 3 Oscars, so those who say this film was \\"snubbed,\\" aren't being completely honest. <br /> <br />James Newton Howard's score is captivating and haunting. I bought the soundtrack and it really is one of my favourites. The love theme for Anne and Kong is tranquil, and the music expressing Kong's famous fall to his death is heart-wrenching. <br /> <br />Now to the one major flaw that prevents me from giving this film the 5 stars it REALLY SHOULD have; the lack of editing and therefore its length. Now, I am all for long movies. In fact judging by past films, the longer the film the better. \\"Titanic,\\" \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" and yes, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" are all three hour plus movies with Best Picture Oscars under there belt. But where \\"Lord of the Rings\\" usedevery last minute to tell the enormous story that is the Tolkein trilogy, \\"King Kong,\\" is weighed down by a blatant abuse of ideas and creativity where the concept of \\"less is more\\" was not appreciated. The section dedicated to the voyage to Skull Island was far too long and drawn out. Likewise, the endless sequences once we finally get to the island, however exciting and brilliantly made, are just too overwhelming. At LEAST forty-five minutes could have been easily shaved. For two thirds, we are given too much on our plate that by the final and most important third, we are too warn out to really care. It's just such a shame, because the final forty-five minutes are so iconic, and so beautiful. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I DID love Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong,\\" because, with the exception of its lack of editing, it is immaculately made, right down to the very last battle scar on Kong's giant body. This is the best remake around, providing a vivid reconstruction of the original masterpiece. No, it is not \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" but with a fine cast, stunning special effects, beautiful music and emotion that with grind at the heartstrings, Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" is one hell of film.

I have to say it is quite enjoyable. The characters are well writen. I plan to read this someday to my child, and I hope the power of Diana Wynne Jones words can take him/her to a fantastic world of witch craft, adventure and romance.
B0000029DD|1.0|Sometimes you live in your own head and fill your own space with the past and the days disappear and recycle and blurr into one, even the music you loved seems empty then somehow you discover someone who puts everything right and gives inspiration to believe and try again. I had never heard of Jeff Buckley until a friend suggested giving the album a try. I  played it with the usual reluctance to venture into the unknown. The immediate stand out track for me was 'Last Goodbye'. The opening base line pulled me in and the song that followed lived up to its promise. Since then the album has grown on me track by track. I am still discovering it at base level, still don't know the song titles, haven't listened to the lyrics or picked up the nuances, these are still to come and I am looking forward to it. It could take years and that's fine with me because in Grace I have found a beautiful friend who can rock me, take me up and mellow me out  depending on the prevailing mood.

B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe's fictionalized account of his young days as a rock writer is a beautiful tale and a trip down memory lane.  So many roles in here are award-worthy-Patrick Fugit as the young rock writer, Kate Hudson as rock band-aid Penny Lane, Frances McDormand as a worried mother, and the scene stealing Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Bangs.  Every one of these characters is lovable despite their flaws.  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and it is integral to the tale Crowe is weaving for the audience.  This is an all-time best movie.
B000AP04EW|3.0|Jameson Thottam with a mediocre rating of \\"Mr and Mrs. Smith\\" <br />Mr. and Mrs. Smith was just out and we decided that would be our choice so off we went. After such a long night and a big lunch at the Olive Garden I could've gone to sleep right there in the theater but we did manage to stay awake during the show.  <br /> <br />Rationale for this movie? Jameson Thottam <br />I wonder, with Mr. and Mrs. Smith's opening weekend ($51 million), how much of that was the movie and how much was curiosity to see the movie that broke up Pitt and Aniston's marriage? Personally, I think it had a lot to do with it but hey, that's just my opinion. I think, after seeing the film, that Pitt and Jolie have good chemistry and it came through on screen. Where this led off screen, they're being coy about, but we all can connect the dots.  <br /> <br />On The Players: Jameson Thottam <br />Pitt plays John Smith and Jolie plays Jane Smith (not exactly original names for undercover operatives huh?). They're both are assassins working for competing government agencies who don't know what the other does. John's cover is as a contracting engineer and Jane's is as a head of a computer firm on wall street. They live the upper middle class dream with a huge house in the suburbs and a Benz and a Cadillac in the garage. To all outward appearances they have it all except that the spark that ignited their marriage no longer exists. They're just going through the motions enroute to the inevitable divorce. In fact, the movie opens with them at a marriage counseling session.  <br /> <br /> <br />I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that eventually they both uncover each other's secret identity when they are each given a contract to kill the other. A hilarious scene ensues when they're eating dinner while each is trying to figure out if the other is trying to kill them.  <br /> <br />Opinions: Jameson Luke Thottam <br />Pitt and Jolie are likable actors and the script plays up their strengths and they both display a deft comic touch. They have good lines and an easy banter that is believable for a husband and wife. It's also very funny to hear then try to unravel their past and separate the lies from the truth about who they really are. Unfortunately, all the other characters are underdeveloped and the script has some huge holes. It's never really explained why competing government agencies would want to eliminate what appears to be their top operatives. They are, after all, on the same side although the agency Jolie works for seems a little more high tech than Pitt's agency.  <br /> <br />Last thoughts: Jameson Thottam <br />In the end, this is definitely a summer movie and probably the only Academy Awards this film will be up for are sound effects since my ears were definitely ringing when I left the theater. The film certainly looks and sounds good but don't examine the plot too carefully because it can't stand up to that kind of scrutiny. I was especially disappointed in the ending which never really resolved anything and left a major plot thread hanging. Obviously, we're being set up for a sequel and with those opening numbers I think in the summer of 2007 we can expect to be watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith II.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Kid A, <br /> <br />Don't bash iTunes when you haven't compared the AAC track to the uncompressed CD track.  Unfortunately, the CD sounds just as bad.  The music seems to be recorded at an excessive volume, sounding distorted, but I guess that's what DM wanted for this album.  Some have compared it to NIN, which DM is not, so that is unfortunate they have gone towards that direction. <br /> <br />Muscially, this album is much better than the terrible Songs of Faith and Devotion, Ultra and Exciter.  However, it will not be considered one of their best.  Some Great Reward, Black Celebration, Music for the Masses, and Violator remain to be their best work.
B00000AF95|3.0|From the remastered CD:<br /><br />When KISS had completed their 1983-1984 Euro-American tour supporting Lick it Up, the band had proven to the fnas and to themselves that it was the music - not the make-up - that mattered most.<br /><br />KISS had by now let guitarist Vinnie Vincent go and without a  lead guitarist searched for a new axeman before recording their next album.  After several unsuccessful auditions took place in New York City, Mark Norton - a California guitar tutor known for his amazing technical telnt - was selected to begin work on Animalize.  Renamed Mark St. John, KISS' newest member seemed to have the fuel that the band needed to skyrocket to the top again.  Perhaps equally as important - St. JOhn didn't have an egotistical personiality: he simply wanted to be a member of KISS.<br /><br />Shortly before KISS entered Right Track Reocrding Studios to lay down initial tracks on Animalize, band co-founder Gene Simmons had abruptly decided to fulfill his second childhood dream: acting.  The filming of Runaway - Simmons' first movie since 1978's KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park - took place in Vancounver, British Columbia.  As a result, Simmons was forced to rlinquish Animlize's co-production chores to his partner, Paul Stanley.  Ambitiously, Standly accepted these responsibilities and produced an album that, ultimately, solidified KISS' popularity with the MTV generation.  Propelled by the single smash \\"Heaven's On Fire,\\" Animalize was certified Platinum.<br /><br />Howver, the band's success was tempred with tragedy once more.  Within months after joining KISS, Mark St. John was afllicted with Reiter's Syndrome - a rare disorder causing severe swelling fo the hands and joints. To their dismay, Stanley, Simmons and Carr had to accept that Mark's crippling illness would limit his involvement on the upcoming Animlize tour.  The band opted to hire a temporary guitarsit until St. John was well enough to play live.  At the suggestion of longtime colleague and fellow musician Jean Beauvoir (who co-wrote \\"Heavena's On Fire\\" and who - in Simmons' absence - played bass on several of the album's tracks), Stanley immeditaely hired Bruce Kulick to substituted on lead guitar for the entire Animalize tour.  Although St. John traveled with KISS in hopes that he would get better, his disability only grew worse.  After less than three performances, the truth had to be faced: St. John could no longer play guitar.  To fill the void, Bruce was hired as KISS ' fourth lead guitarist.  With no time to spare, KISS Animalize Live toure opned in Brighton, England on September 30, 1984.<br /><br />I have KISS Animalize Live/Uncencored and it is telling that there are only two songs in the set list from Animalize whilst there are 3 from Lick it Up (the previous album) and 4 from Creatures of the Night (the album before that).<br /><br />General concensus is that the band's songwriting didn't go on the upswing until Revenge, when they brought back Vinnie Cusano (= Vinnie Vincent) to help with the songwriting.<br /><br />My speculation is that Paul and Gene need a guitar player to round out the songwriting, but are control freaks who don't want to surrender any power, and the only reason the two have stayed together so long is that they think so much alike.  They couldn't get along with the only other songwriters they ever had: Ace and Vinnie.  Mark St. John isn't listed in any of the songwriting credits on Animalize, but he may have arrived after the songs were written and been reduced to adding solos and fills much like Adrian Smith on Killers.  Bruce Kulick is a talented guitar player who contributes little to the songwriting - exactly what Paul and Gene wanted.<br /><br />In playing ability terms, Animalize is the best lineup KISS ever had.  Thrills in the Night is a middling quality song with a good chorus and the best guitar solo ever done on any KISS song.  Heaven's on Fire is one of my absolute favorite KISS songs - it's only shortcoming, oddly enough, is that the solo is rather lame.<br /><br />On the whole the songwriting on this album is uninspired but it isn't until the follow up Asylum that the band's songs descend into saccharine 80's wussy metal (I'm being polite with my language).  Also, the production on Animalize is very good, as opposed to the totally neutered sound on Crazy Nights (following Asylum), and I'm not saying that because of the keyboards, which I have no problem with.ortcoming, oddly enough, is that the solo is rather lame.   <br />On the whole the songwriting on this album is uninspired but it isn't until the follow up Asylum that the band's songs descend into saccharine 80's wussy metal (I'm being polite with my language).

B00004RJEG|5.0|I am a huge Corrs fan, and have every album and DVD they have ever put out. I strongly believe that there first two albums  are still the best material they have released. This DVD consists of virtually all songs from those albums as well as one or two which were released afterwards on there later albums. As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's. The set list is as good as you could hope apart from one or two that were left out. SOund is fantastic, video is fantastic and it is an overall fantastic buy and must have for any fan of great music.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Trying to describe this movie is impossible.  When you get down to the core of it, it is about an unemployed stoner and bowling league member, The Dude, who gets mistaken for a millionaire philanthropist and has his crappy rug damaged by some bad guys.  The Dude's main position in the movie is trying to obtain restitution for his rug, and this leads to him getting caught up in the kidnapping of the millionaire's wife.  All of this plot is a little weak, and that's the beauty of the movie.  The movie is truly a collection of unforgettable characters and scenes in which the slacker criminals go up against the big guys.  We have a stolen car, a missing briefcase full of money, a severed toe, some neo-nihilist European criminals, a naked feminist artist, a porn king, and a lot of White Russians.  Jeff Bridges is brilliant as The Dude, but equally impressive is John Goodman's bitter Vietnam vet with a very clear sense of justice (even if it gets them in more trouble every time).  This is a ingenious recipe for a black comedy.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This album is the best Snoop Doggy Dogg album in his career. I like this because this is the production, the rhymes, and also the beats. Snoop Dogg definitely made a classic, him and Dr. Dre. So I prefer all Death Row records and S-n-double o-p fans to cop this.
B000002KJQ|2.0|For any collector of music,a majority of CD reissues are faithful(or can even enhance)the original production. Alas, with Tres Hombres (in my opinion ZZ Top's finest album, and a rock classic to boot), the drums have been remixed with something similar to <br />their 80's offerings. (Which are fine by the way, but do not belong here) It has ruined the sound and overlooked some of the excellent musicianship on the original recordings. The same applies to the album `Tejas' I would ignore this issue till Warner Bros decide to reissue early ZZ Top with respectful and decent remastering, such as that shown in the `Chrome, Smoke and BBQ' boxset and `Rancho Texicano' (Very Best Of), where Engineer and remastering expert Bob Ludwig has done a faithful and exceptional job. As for now, those with fond memories of ZZ Top on the vinyl versions, will be in for a nasty shock. <br />
0393327655|1.0|Mr. Harris has religiously and fervently given up on openness in a society that espouses it.  He wants conversations about topics and gives equal weight to each area - not giving people any sense of what matters to them.  He is of the humanistic movement where everything and anything goes.  He gives conversations about topics an equal standing so that all of us would accept anything without much regard for what we trully believe.  As he talks about this equal weighting of conversations, the next moment he has biased his thoughts against religion.  Why doesn't he give equal weight to religion and stop trying to get the scientific stuff shoved up people's noses?  All scientist don't believe that there is no God.  He also compares a fly to a human embryo and that if we kill a fly we are destroying something more advanced than the cells making up the embryo.  He is misled in his thinking and should stop making the conversation one sided about his own personal beliefs.  The next time you want to swat a fly, think about the life that you are destoying for everything is sacred to Mr. Harris in his humanistic world except religious freedom and belief.  I would use this book for the fireplace as the winter will be cold.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this movie. This is a great British ensemble with the qualities of acting you can expect. However, the writing of plot and dialogue left a lot to be desired. It seemed that the writers tried to be as witty as the writers of 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL' with the complicated plot of 'GOSFORD PARK' and they failed because they released the movie for a mass market in a hurry rather than aim for a quality production. <br /> <br />My greatest disappointment is that the commentary of the director is listed in the bonus section but is not included on the DVD. If this bonus item is selected, the DVD returns the viewer to the menu. This is like buying a good novel and omitting the expository chapters.
B00005JNQA|4.0|This is an above-average international political thriller, bringing African politics and genocide to the game of American spy movies.  The moviemakers created a generic African country with a fake name to represent a number of tragedies on that continent in recent decades, and female lead Nicole Kidman plays a UN interpreter who grew up in the strife-ridden African country and has some revolutionary experience of her own.  Kidman's agenda is never really clear to her government handlers or to the viewer, and the plot is full of twists and turns.  This is one of the better thrillers of the year, so check it out if you enjoy this type of movie.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|...The cat's got no soul. He's like a cardboard cutout . His sound is completely derivative , and in no way unique or innovative. He can play some decent stuff...but is is all like as if im listening to someone playing back all the riffs they know like theyre some kind of living tape player. And dont get my started on his breathy singing , which while okay for pop, is totally weak for blues/rock. Keep \\"trying\\" john, maybe another 10 years you may have something to say thats not a total rip-off.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This album is high energy, rhythm driven, catchy pop music that will get you in the mood for going out and dancing. Kapranos' vocals are excellent, capturing the attitude of the lyrics effortlessly through his strong voice and subtle nuances and changes in tone. The lyrics themselves are clever and funny, and are perefectly matched by the beautifully constructed harmonies which accompany an average of three infectious riffs in every track. The record is flawlessly produced which adds to the up to the minute fashion flavour. Definitely worth a listen.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I traveled by train for an hour to see this film in NYC because it wasn't playing anywhere on Long Island.  It was worth it.  The movie scenery alone was worth the trip.  I haven't seen a mountain that beautiful since Julie Andrews sang to the hills in Austria...        Folks, I loved the movie, but I am sick to death of hearing people assure the homophobic public that this \\"really isn't a gay love story.\\"   The hell it ain't.  That's exactly what it is.  The movie portrays that love to be as genuine, as special, and as fulfilling as the love between straight people; a portrayal long overdue.  We also read from many, that it portrays love that cuts across gender lines.  OK.   But let's not shy away from identifying the love being portrayed.  It is a love story between two gay men (even if they can't identify themselves as gay).  It is not a gay-cowboy movie..  they herded sheep for one summer of the 20 years spanning the film.  Just two men who loved each other more than their wives,,, more than anyone else..     At the end of the film I felt depressed.  On the ride back to Long Island, I wondered why a movie was affecting me that way.  I mean, it was sad how it ended, but why was I so personally affected by it?  And I think the the lost opportunities portrayed in the film represent the lost opportunities so many of us who are gay have suffered due to homophobia.  Maybe not just romance, but opportunities that were denied to us because of the prejudice, and how tragic that has been.     It was a great movie all around.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It is very easy to compare Muse to Radiohead.  I did it initially after hearing Time is Running Out.  Calling Muse a Radiohead clone is just a lazy approach.  No one can deny the resemblance between the voices of Thom Yorke and Matt Bellamy, but that is where the comparisons should end.  If any other singer fronted Muse, they would be praised by most critics as genuine and unique.  Matt Bellamy is a HUGE talent musically.  Anyone who sees Muse live will understand just how talented this band is.  They actual can outplay their \\"muse\\" Radiohead and have a very musical background.  There is a very heavy baroque classical influence on this cd and when meshed with heavy, disorted guitars, it is very refreshing and enjoyable.  No one can deny the talent this band has.  They can perform better than 99% of the bands out there but will never receive the credit they deserve because of the Radiohead comparisons.  Hopefully on their next cd they can put these cricitisms to rest and blow people's minds.  There is still potential for improvement and seeing the evolution from cd to cd, I can only bet we are in store for something bigger and better.  These lazy critics have to listen past the vocals and focus on the great musicianship and songwriting Muse displays. In fact, Matt Bellamy has a far broader range than Thom Yorke and much more powerful voice.  Absoultion is easily one of the best cd's of 2003 and one of the best of the 2000's so far in so many ways.  This is progressive music that can appeal to the majority of people for its sense of melody which makes it very interesting.  This isnt a dream theater cd that is meant only to appeal to musicians and elitists.  It can appeal to most people.

B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is an excellent cd in my opinion. I have the original version and I wanted to have this version, so I did. I bought it because I loved the original version and this has 4 extra songs. Maybe you don't think it's worth to buy the same cd with \\"just\\" 4 extra songs. But if you re-release an album it may only contain 4 new songs. If it has more new songs, it counts as an entire new album on the billboard charts. And now over to the cd.  <br />The first track and also the first single is \\"It's Like That\\". This is a great song to dance on and it's just about having a great party. The next track and the second single is \\"We Belong Together\\". We all know how great this song is, it is the biggest single of the year (#1 for 14 weeks). The third song/single is \\"Shake It Off\\". Just love the song. \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Stay The Night\\" are 2 very great ballads. Mariah belts out those famous notes and it made me think of \\"My All\\" (Butterfly) and \\"Without You\\" (Music Box). \\"Say Somethin'\\" and \\"To The Floor\\" are both produced by the Neptunes. That says enough I guess, you'll have a great time listening and dancing to these songs. \\"Get Your Number\\" was only released in Europe. It's also a great party song. Great chemistry between Mariah & Jermaine Dupri. \\"One And Only\\" and \\"Circles\\" are so beautiful, it's about love and the problems that you might have with it. \\"Your Girl\\" is the shortest song on the cd but it has a nice beat and great vocals. \\"I Wish You Knew\\" and \\"Joy Ride\\" are beautiful ballads. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is a gospel song and I love it.  <br />And now the bonus tracks. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is the new single. It's already #2 on the billboard hot 100 chart. The best way to describe this song is a mix between \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\". It's just a very great song. \\"Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do)\\" is great track. Mariah & Jermaine made another great song. \\"So Lonely (One And Only Part II)\\" is one of the best songs on the album. It's really hot, Mariah and Twista make magic. And the last track is \\"We Belong Together (Remix)\\" with Jadakiss & Styles P. An excellent remix of the original song. I love the end-note of Mariah.  <br />My favorite songs are \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\". All the other tracks are very very good. <br /> <br />This version also contains a dvd with the 4 videos of \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Get Your Number\\". There's also a link to watch the video of \\"Don't Forget About Us\\". And if that's not enough, you'll have a link to watch an exclusive interview of Mariah in her own words. It's really worth to buy this version.
B00079ZACM|5.0|After Gordon 's death Sudan is under dervishes 'power; meanwhile in England, a British gentleman refuses to join to the Army just the day before the invasion. His colleagues send him three feathers, which is considered synonymous of cowardice, additionally his future father in law and his fianc&eacute;e reject him due this decision.<br /><br />But his wounded self stem, proud and honor will transform him, and eventually he will prove all of them his convictions are nothing in common with his moral thoughts, in a sturdy exercise of heroism and redemption. The epic may nestle in the most unexpected places.<br /><br />This film is - to my mind - the supreme masterpiece of Zoltan Korda without hesitating. One of the most admirable lessons of life ever expressed in screen.
0441172717|5.0|Let's talk, for just a moment---here, in the shadow of the Citadel, in the instants before the space above us folds in on itself, tears open and disgorges a Harkonnen battle fleet, hopped up on cruelty, girded for war, and ready to blast down the shield wall and unleash carnage.<br /><br />Nah, don't get up: Doctor Yueh says the Shield Wall should hold, and he *can't* lie---he's got the Imperial conditioning, after all.<br /><br />Let's talk of space, and time-shifting, and ferociously deadly assassins, of Dukes and Padishah Emperors and plots within plots, wheels within wheels; but most of all, best of all certainly, of Spice and Giant Worms.<br /><br />Let us speak, for a time, of Dune, of Arrakis, Desert Planet.<br /><br />Dune is as simple, or as complex, as you want to make it: certainly Frank Herbert has created an epic, which literally spans galaxies and, ultimately, centuries, but it is a curiously, deliciously intimate epic. At first blush Herbert created a classic space opera, the desert world Dune serving as both backdrop and battleground for a vicious, bloody rivalry between two of the Empire's great noble Houses, the Atreides and the Harkonnens.<br /><br />In THIS corner, the bantam-weight challenge, House Atreides: helmed by Duke Leto, daddy to young, naive Paul, whose mother Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit witch. Well, OK, former-witch, or anyway a witch who stopped shaving her head and paying her witch-dues. Atreides hails from homeworld Calidan, a planet of woods and water and decent aesthetics. I hear they even recycle.<br /><br />And in THIS corner, former heavyweight champ-EE-uhn going out again for the title, House Harkonnen! Headed up by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who brings new meaning to the phrase \\"all up in the air\\", its homeworld is planet Giedi Prime, whose Three-Mile-Island nuclear disaster ambience is all just part of its charm. House Harkonnen has its hands full ripping out its lackeys' heart plugs and throttling whores, but nonetheless finds time to carry out assassinations and conduct interstellar warfare! Talk about productivity!<br /><br />So on the surface, yeah, \\"Dune\\" is all about this colossal blood-feud between two houses, with the Padishah Emperor Shadam and his masters from the Spice Guild pulling the strings in the shadows.<br /><br />But you know what hooked me on \\"Dune\\", back years ago when I happened upon it at the age of 12? It's all about this wild-eyes, prodigious, utterly self-absorbed little kid coming of age in a truly alien environment.<br /><br />Back then, I could relate.<br /><br />I was in the middle of a pretty wild and woolly transition, myself: spirited away from my own homeworld of Oregon, land of woods and water (and recycling, come to think of it), as the result of my dad being transferred by the unimaginably vast, uncaring multinational he worked for (the transfer itself fraught with worries, and machinations, and potential backstabbing). Destination: Utah.<br /><br />Since my family were to live at the base of the mountains, I initially thought of Utah in Lord of the Rings terms: I would now be encamped at the base of the Misty Mountains.<br /><br />But having seen my new home from the plane, it was decided: Utah, Deseret, Desert Planet. So naturally, as a wide-eyed transplanted child trying to acclimate to a strange, and fairly hostile, new environment, I *got* \\"Dune\\" completely.<br /><br />The Princess Irulan was right: a beginning is a *most* dangerous time. With that in mind, Frank Herbert carried out a stroke of genius by framing his War of the Worlds from the viewpoint of a young Prince, a young prince who might be human---who would grow up to be a Rebel lord---and who might, just possibly, be the prophesied Messiah, the One who would unshackle the spice melange from the machinations of the Empire and its vassals, and set the Fremen---well, Free.<br /><br />And ride gigantic sandworms, to boot. Can't leave out the really good stuff.<br /><br />As to the political implications of \\"Dune\\"---a book about a clash of the Great Powers over a vast, arid desert rich with oil---oops, I mean MELANGE!---well, the veil here is flimsy at best. And in our post-9/11 age, some might get a case of the giggles or even the quease over \\"Dune\\"'s fixation with messianic warrior-saviors, and oppressed desert rebels, and the prominence of Jihad---getting back control over the vital worm poop that helps the Galaxy keep on truckin'. Maybe it's best to keep this one out of the hands of Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />But that's all secondary: Herbert has crafted a masterwork of pulpy space opera that nonetheless bores into the deeply intimate and mystical: his is a universe of high deviltry and massive betrayal, of nefarious plots, demonically wicked villains, and impossibly loyal heroes.<br /><br />Herbert has been chastised for his beefy prose style which some have castigated as ungainly, but I disagree---Herbert was a consummate craftsman with his words, and has a rich, pulpy style that keeps the deviltry moving and never fails to draw you in.<br /><br />And the little hints of a far larger universe---the sayings of the Prophet, Irulan's own musings on the affairs of her Age, the verses from the Orange Catholic Bible, the origins and shadow-haunted practices of the Bene Gesserit, or the Bene Tleilax (the shape-shifting assassins of Herbert's universe)---all of these prime the hunger for more glimpses of the world beyond the shifting sands of the titular Desert Planet.<br /><br />For those of you utterly new to \\"Dune\\"---its bloodthirsty familial rivalry, its moments of high holy insanity, its monstrous betrayals, its intricate, unforgettable characters---well, I envy you deeply.<br /><br />The Spice must flow. So will the pages.<br /><br />JSGgood stuff.  <br /> <br />As to the political implications of \\"Dune\\"---a book about a clash of the Great Powers over a vast, arid desert rich with oil---oops, I mean MELANGE!---well, the veil here is flimsy at best.

B0009QBLA8|5.0|Okay, I've read all the reviews, and other than the professor, I have to disagree with everyone here!  Okay, I haven't seen the Fritz Lang movie, but I am curious.  First of all, David Lynch is an artist.  I met the man recently in Ann Arbor, Michigan and he stated at the beginning of his talk that he started out as an artist, and in one of his paintings that he did many years ago, he invisioned it moving, thus was born \\"Five Men Getting Sick\\", which, as the professor mentions, you can purchase, along with other Lynch goodies, at Davidlynch.com!  The video is just that, six men, actually six distorted head like images consistently vomiting to the sound of a siren.  But that is the artist in Mr. Lynch. <br />Here is my definition of Eraserhead.  The film, to me, represents good versus evil(Lady in the Radiator vs. The Seductive woman across the hall).  Notice how she violently reacts when LITR appears, then all of a sudden she laments \\"In heaven, everything is fine.\\"  Then there's the guy at the beginning of the movie who has power of the controls which, when he starts manipulating them in the beginning of the movie, Henry reacts in a frightened manner, especially when those white, pre-fetus like abominations appear.  The whole movie is, as some of the reviewers put it \\"dark and eerie\\".  Making a long story short, at the end of the movie when the control operator's levers jam, Henry is engulfed in a white, ethereal light with angelic sound as the Lady in the radiator appears and hugs Henry as if to let him know that indeed, in Heaven everything is fine!

She doesn't do the vocal gymnastics that she might on other of her cds.  The remakes are great renditions and the new material is cool and origanal.  I absolutely love O Holy Night and Rest Ye Merry Gentleman, All I Want For Christmas and also Miss You Most At Christmastime.  This is an excellent cd and you should set aside all predjudice and take the time to listen to this amazing talented singer do what she does best.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Jaded by the sheer volume of hype surrounding Peter Jackson and this kong-length flick, I very hesitantly went to see this film. <br /> <br />Yet, I really was pleasantly suprised and genuinely glad that I saw it on the big screen. The story is handled with deft sincerity, the visuals are spectacular and although long, the work is finely paced so that it never feels drawn out. <br /> <br />In particular, Kong is truly wonderful. His emotions are clearly verbalised through his facial movements, his relationship with Anne is beautifully tender and the fight scenes are absolutely gripping. Andy Circus has done an excellent job with Jackson's Kong, and it is he who steals the limelight. <br /> <br />That said, there are some minor issues with the work. It has obviously been cheese-afied for the American market, and some of the script rings false. I also grew restless with the slow-action close-up shots of a teary Noami Watts. Similarly, some scenes (particularly on the island) could have been removed to make the length of the film more palatable. <br /> <br />Regardless, suprisingly worthwhile for such a mainstream piece.

For the rest of us, the film comes across as a dark, cynical and ultimately one-dimensional vision of a world gone mad over oil.<br /><br />That said, it is mesmerizing to watch.  From the first scene, the movie grabs our attention.  George Clooney has just sold a bomb to some locals in Iran.  What will it be used for?  Is Clooney going to get killed?  Is he a good guy or bad guy?  We don't find out right away, as the film skips around from one location to another and from one subplot to another with dizzying speed, usually just long enough for us to get the idea that someone is about to get backstabbed, double-crossed, conned, tortured or killed.  The cinematography is edgy; the soundtrack is menacing.  We constantly have a sense that something evil is about to happen.  Most of the time we don't know what and we don't know why, but we are pretty sure that it has something to do with OIL.<br /><br />Warning: don't leave your seat in the middle to get some popcorn; you'll be hopelessly lost.  I spent half the movie trying to figure out what was going on.  What does the CIA operative in Beirut have to do with the energy analyst in Geneva have to do with the law firm in Washington have to do with the Pakistani workers in the Persian Gulf, and on it goes.  The common theme, of course, is oil.  Finally, in the last third of the movie, the various sub-plots start to come together and give eachother meaning.  But it's too little, too late.  The movie is spread so thin with multiple characters and stories, that there is little satisfying resolution to anything.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\" will be compared to \\"Traffic\\", and the styles are similar, but the characters and subplots in Traffic are more fully developed, and enough of the characters are sympathetic, with the result that the viewer is more engrossed in how it all turns out.  In contrast, it's hard to like or care about any of the characters in Syriana.  In the end, it is a thinly woven tapestry whose message is that Oil has corrupted the world.  If you believe that, you'll be deeply satisfied that this film has brought your views to life with such power and intensity, but many will just leave the theatre feeling depressed and befuddled.re more fully developed, and enough of the characters are sympathetic, with the result that the viewer is more engrossed in how it all turns out.

B00005M989|5.0|This cd rocks.  I love it.  There are so many good songs on here from a guy with so many hits.  He might be weird, but he's so talented.  You can't go past I Wanna Be Your Lover, Cream and Theives in The Temple.  I love his music and for all those people out there who aren't fans enough to buy the odd cd or two of his, go get this where there are all the great songs on the one disc.  You'll love this too.
0307276902|1.0|Jame's Frey's book is as much a memoir of addiction recovery as it is a celebration of his own brash and irrational rejection of authority, convention, and God. Though his testimony is courageous, it should be evident to any reader who finishes this book that his stubbornly independent recovery strategy wasn't enough to help him overcome his character flaws. Frey's writing betrays his reliance on profanity to convey emotion and his ineptitude in higher literary articulation. His sentiments betray his egotism and his disdain of religion. His relationships betray his lack of wisdom and of respect for law and morality. I highly discourage reading this book, and vehemently discourage subscribing to its philosophies. Though Frey overcame drugs, his integrity is still in shambles.
B00007LTIC|5.0|From the classic Fragile to the immortal The Yes Album to Close to the edge, which I think is a thing of beauty, it seemed difficult for them to top any of this. I went to see Yes in Pittsburgh on the Going for the One tour in 77 and will never forget; the civic arena in Pittsburgh has a VERY unique feature. The roof moves and they can open the roof of an indoor concert and suddenly, you are outdoor. Unique thing #2. The section of the roof that opens first in the arena (it opens one wedge at a time) gives you a spectacular view of the US Steel building, which is more or less across the street. The concert opened with Firebird Suite as the roof began to roll aside. When the first wedge was fully open, each concert goer who looked up saw the album cover. The view through the hole in the roof was a straight up view of the US Steel building. I felt as if I were the man on the cover, looking up at the building. I'll never forget it. I told you that to tell you this. This album has ALWAYS been my favorite Yes album and I sort of felt as if I had to keep that a secret, for fear people would think I was nuts considering some of the the masterpieces that I mentioned before. As I was reading through some of the reviews of this album (except for the nut from Tokyo) I see that I am not alone. This album, especially Turn of the Century and Awaken define me. I couldn't agree more that if music were an orgasm Awaken would be it (my regrets to Bolero). Whether you are or are not a Yes fan, this album is a MUST.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I was a great fan of the Carpenters from the time I heard \\"Close to You\\" more than three decades ago.  I believe Karen Carpenter was (and still is) one of the most under-rated singers of the twentieth century, primarily because the beauty of their music ran headlong into the harder rock-n-roll of the 1970's.  DJ's often shunned their music and even ridiculed it to a point where many younger listeners were afraid to admit they liked the Carpenter sound.  Had it not been for Karen's untimely passing, I don't doubt they would have persevered through that era and become embraced once more as music with melodies came back into vogue; and Karen would have been properly recognized for her superb voice and flawless delivery of lyrics.     AS FOR THE ALBUM ITSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     First of all, the two-disc set is more than just a series of tracks of Christmas music: It is an extremely well arranged and produced Christmas performance.  Although it is a studio recording, it seems more like hearing a Christmas concert than listening to a Christmas CD.  Each disc begins with an overture; fine instrumental and choral passages, during which Richard, who generally allowed all of the limelight to shine on his sister, gets to display his talent as a performer.   The overture on disc 1 uses shortened versions of \\"Deck the Halls\\", \\"I Saw Three Ships\\", \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\", \\"Away In a Manger\\", \\"What Child Is This\\", \\"Carol Of The Bells\\", and \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" to set the mood and lead us into the more secular songs, such as: \\"The Christmas Waltz\\", \\"Sleigh Ride\\", \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"Jingle Bells\\", and \\"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow\\".  The tempo and mood then slow slightly for \\"Merry Christmas Darling\\", \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\", \\"Christ Is Born\\", and \\"Ave Maria\\".  Richard shows his production genius with a pacing of tempo and mood that allows the music to flow from one track to another so that the listener is hardly aware of breaks between songs.  Disc 2 uses a similar, but slightly different format that puts more of the up-tempo secular songs into a medley.      Usually, as I listen to a CD, I take advantage of my CD remote to jump to the songs I really like, skipping the ones with lesser appeal.  In this case the music flows so smoothly I just never find myself tempted to skip anything.  I listened straight through the collection as I am doing while I write this.  There is not one song in the two-disc set that I do not like.     It is simply the best Christmas collection I have ever heard.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins is a former faculty member of the Stanford University of Business where he received the Distinguished Teacher Award.  He wondered why some companies achieved greatness while most never came close.  In this book he offers seven defining differences between average companies and those that exceeded the stock market by 300% or more over a period of 15 years.  This five year intensive study yielded conclusions both expected and non-intuitive.<br /><br />Companies that went from 'Good to Great' were led by self-effacing, modest CEOs that had a fierce drive for results.  They were quick to give others credit while taking any blame upon themselves.  They were anything but flashy.<br /><br />Good to Great (G-G) companies hired the best in the field so little training, motivation and command/control were necessary.  The 'right' people were their most important assett.  These hired executives actually earned a little less than average showing that compensation was not a driving factor.<br /><br />G-G companies confronted the brutal facts of reality as opportuinties for change.  They created a corporate atmosphere that made it easy for any employee to deliver the sometimes harsh but needed truths.<br /><br />G-G companies were singleminded and constant in their purpose and vision.  Anything that didn't further their vision was axed.  This included all decisions including acquisitions and mergers.<br /><br />G-G companies maintained a culture of discipline and accoutability that started at the top.  They realized that discipline could not be pounded into someone, it had to come from the inside.<br /><br />G-G comanies used the existing technologies only to the extent that they aided their single-minded purpose.  They were not technology driven and didn't look for the 'magic bullet' in it.<br /><br />G-G companies maintained a slow, steady build-up of momentum in the direction of their vision and core concepts.  They didn't jump haphazardly at every opportuinity to temporarily build the bottom line.<br /><br />It is interesting that some of the companies listed in this book have not done so well since the book has been written, but it doesn't make its information any less valuable.  It is quite possible that these companies lost their edge in the above areas.<br /><br />Five Starspportuinity to temporarily build the bottom line. <br /> <br />It is interesting that some of the companies listed in this book have not done so well since the book has been written, but it doesn't make its information any less valuable.

I talk myself out of the experience 9 out of 10 times when I think of the process of getting there, including wrestling with traffic and parking, and thinking of the reality of sitting there through 20 minutes of commercials and movie previews before the real show begins.<br /><br />Challenges aside, the movie was worth seeing.<br /><br />It starts off like soft Gay porn with lots of writing around it to dilute or slow the build to the first sex scene in the tent.<br /><br />Beginning in the 1960's, the characters are both White, thin and too pretty, which only supports an idealized version of the cowboys from what I feel is a very homoerotic stance.<br /><br />You can feel the tension building between Jack's pursuing of Ennis, using alcohol to build courage in one and lower inhibitions in the other.<br /><br />Then at that first sex scene in the tent when the Ennis mounts Jack from behind and does the classic porn spit (in lieu of lubricant) into his hand before doing the deed, I'm left thinking Ennis is either not as inexperienced as he plays to be or Ang Lee was going for the money shot.<br /><br />Over the course of the next 20 years Ennis and Jack build a world of lies with marriages and children, only to escape on fishing trips to Brokeback Mountain for time they could share with each other.  Their time together is sweet, image filled and a chance to learn more about the conversationally challenged Ennis.<br /><br />The flavor of the story, even when it isn't, is made to feel tragic.  Repressed Ennis was initially a conquest for the worldlier and scheming Jack.  Jack is made fun of in his Straight world as a mess-up, and Ennis just isn't smart enough to get out of his own way.<br /><br />Jack ends up being Gay bashed and Ennis remained dirt poor with only his memories of Brokeback Mountain.

0887306101|5.0|\\"Market Wizards\\" was the first of 3 Market Wizards books in which Jack Schwager interviews top traders in the financial markets about their backgrounds, experiences, and techniques. Published in 1989, the interviews in this book were conducted while the stock market crash of October 1987 was fresh in people's minds, which I found added some interest. Some of those interviewed made money on the crash, some lost money, and many have something to say about it. The book is divided into 5 sections, each containing a series of interviews. Jack Schwager introduces each interview by telling us a little about the trader, then we get an edited transcript of the interview, followed by a brief summary of that trader's philosophy. The information the traders provide about their techniques is enough to give a general impression of what they do, not enough to tip their hand, but is outdated in today's market anyway.<br /><br />Perhaps because Jack Schwager was a commodities analyst, the first and largest section, \\"Futures and Currencies\\",  is dedicated to commodities traders. Jack Schwager provides brief explanations of the futures and currency markets, then moves on to interviews of 7 commodities traders. Interview subjects include the great Michael Marcus, who multiplied his company account 2500-fold in a decade, and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Bruce Kovner, perhaps the world's largest currency and futures trader at the time. Larry Hite tells some great stories about what not to do when playing the markets. Part 2, \\"Mostly Stocks\\", features interviews with 4 traders of stocks or index futures, including William O'Neil, his prot&eacute;g&eacute; David Ryan, and the man who won big several times in the U.S. Trading Championships, S&P futures trader Marty Schwartz. Part 3, \\"A Little Bit of Everything\\", includes Mark Weinstein and Quantum Fund co-founder James B. Rogers, Jr. Part 4, \\"The View from the Floor\\", interviews 3 traders who trade in the pits.<br /><br />Part 5, \\"The Psychology of Trading\\", features an interview with Dr. Van K. Tharp, a research psychologist who studied \\"the psychology of winning\\" so as to come up with a \\"model\\" of winning traits which can then be taught to other people. He's a flake, in my view, who bases his practice on various \\"beliefs\\", but his \\"super-trader\\" classes probably provided him a nice income. Explanations of program trading, portfolio insurance, and options, which are referred to in several of the interviews, are provided in Appendixes in the back of the book. There is also a glossary of terms. \\"Market Wizards\\" is often touted as being superior to Schwager's latest Wizard book, 2001's \\"Stock Market Wizards\\", but I don't think it is. The names in this one are bigger, the information more vague, but \\"Market Wizards\\" has added historical interest at this point, since most of these people traded in the 1970s, when markets were more predictable, adapted to rapid change and increased competition in the 1980s, and then traded through the crash of 1987.s an interview with Dr. Van K.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Every so often something comes out that is extraordinary.  Martin Scorsese took the time to put together a documentary of possibly the finest writer of the 20th Century.  This shows Dylan from his growing up years in Hibbing Minnesota to his coffee house years in Greenwich Village.  For any Dylan fan this documentary is a must. It goes into his rise in detail and has unreleased footage of several performances. Among the performances are This Land is Your Land, which shows Dylan paying tribute to Woody Guthrie.  You also hear a rare recording of Song to Woody from his very first album. You hear a Demo of his classic, Dont Think Twice Its Alright. This recording pre-dates the version from the Freewheelin Bob Dylan. The lyrics are the same as the way Peter, Paul and Mary recorded them on their album.  Masters of War is live and sounds like the version on the album.  I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow is certainly worth the listen..  When the Ship Comes in and Mr Tambourine Man are also very well done.  The version of Blowin in the Wind is a disappointment.  The second CD is loaded with electric tunes he later did.  Dylan himself is interviewed as well as contemporarites such as Joan Baez and others who knew him at the time.  Dylan has always been a very private individual so we finally see the man for what he really is, and what he meant to America in the 60's  I would not only recommend this to Dylan fans but to any historian who wants to know about Bob Dylan.  Martin Scorsese as he did with his blues series has really put a gem together
B00005JO1Y|5.0|The 2005 \\"King Kong\\" ends with this sentiment: \\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\" Perhaps in the classic 1933 version, but not in Peter Jackson's epic reimagining of it. His \\"Kong\\" retains the essential story elements of the original, but elevates the tale beyond its origins. Instead of a simple \\"beauty and the beast\\" action adventure, this \\"Kong\\" emerges as a kind of paean to naturalism, a condemnation of the technology that at once makes the world and peoples' minds smaller. It is a tale involving the sort of wonder, horror, and beauty that I have not seen on the big screen...well, since Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films.<br /><br />The film starts off with thirties-style credits, immediately evoking a mood for the piece that is kept throughout. Then Jackson does something unexpected for a big-budget action picture: he proceeds for a good forty-five minutes to show nothing but normal, mundane human activity. Soup lines, public workers, failing businesses, Depression-era hunger and quiet desperation. He allows us to understand why a faltering director like Carl Denham would throw everything away on a final gamble, and why a delicate young actress like Ann Darrow would get on a filthy steamer in the middle of the night and sail off to an unknown location. It is an unusual choice for a filmmaker, but it works, particularly in contrast with what follows.<br /><br />Jackson also makes use of his experience with epics in \\"Kong\\": the second half of the movie, in stark contrast to the first, frequently feels like one giant extended chase scene, but with the exception of one particularly disgusting episode involving mammoth insects, the pacing never slacks, and the thrills simply get bigger and better. Dinosaurs, bugs, savage tribes, more dinosaurs, and forces of nature all make malicious appearances in attempts to hinder the crew, yet the narrative rarely ever feels strained. Here is a three-hour movie that one never realizes is three hours while watching it. Part of this is due to Jackson's wise echoing of Spielberg in his treatment of the \\"monster.\\" Kong doesn't make an appearance until well over an hour into the film, but there are ominous foreshadowings of him from very early on: a strange shadow on a map, simian rock formations, murmurs of a name, the score rumbling in low growls. When Kong finally appears, the tension has been built up to such an extent that it comes as a shock to finally see him. The payoff is enormous.<br /><br />Kong himself is astonishing. He is animated using the same kind of motion-capture performance technology that Jackson used for Gollum in the \\"Rings\\" films, and using the same actor, too, Andy Serkis, who does more than just play a mammoth ape: his Kong just may be the most human character in the film. He runs, jumps, and fights most impressively - at point he faces down no fewer than three Tyrannosaurus Rexes - but most endearing are his quiet, tender scenes with Ann. One particularly haunting scene involves the two on a frozen pond in Central Park: Kong slides and frolics on the ice in what can only be described as delighted wonder, and his expression is mirrored by Ann. They have a connection, a chemistry, that not even the writer Jack Driscoll, with all his wonderful words, can match.<br /><br />Naomi Watts does quite well in the role of the blonde damsel: she seems as though she cannot quite decide whether she is in distress or not. Like Fay Wray before her, she does her fair share of screaming, but she also has a certain delicate strength to her that is intriguing, both to us and to Kong; she is not afraid to fight back and to use her talents to her advantage. She forces Kong to respect her, and allows him to protect her, and it is this that forms the basis of their strange, primal connection. When she screams in horror in the final climax, it is not because of the ape climbing the Empire State Building; it is because of those in relentless pursuit of him.<br /><br />The supporting players areas good as anything else in the movie. Adrian Brody and Jack Black are perhaps not obvious choices for action movies, but they fill their characters perfectly, in ways that are both obvious and surprising. Brody plays Jack Driscoll, a playwright whose dreams lie with the theatre, but who manages to get ensnared in Denham's web. Judging from the look on his face as he watches Ann, one suspects he does not entirely mind. Brody has a quiet, intense, almost suffering look to him at times that suits his character perfectly: here is a man who is more at home with typewriters than T-rexes, who nevertheless manages to rewrite himself in order to save the girl. He is not necessarily happy about things he must do, but he does them.<br /><br />Played by Jack Black, the film director Carl Denham is more than a determined filmmaker; he is slick and clever, a perpetual opportunist, who manipulates coincidence to his advantage and takes his cameras on rescue missions. Should there ever be a choice presented to him between the two, one strongly suspects it is the camera that would emerge victorious. Black does not play Denham as a likeable or a good man, but he is supremely entertaining to watch. He is the sort of man who is dogged by nerve-wrackingly close calls, and yet it is rarely him that they effect, but those surrounding him. One character describes him as having an \\"innate ability to destroy the things he loves.\\" Perhaps this is inaccurate; he does not seem to love anything but himself, and he is the one character who comes out the least unscathed. This, however, may be the point of the film: at the end, Denham has not lost much of anything that he cared about, but perhaps it is the caring that is most important.<br /><br />The effects are not all entirely convincing, but I'm not certain they are meant to be: they evoke that kind of larger-than-life, dreamlike quality that fantasies always seem to have. One such instance is a remarkable dinosaur stampede on the island: the creatures don't have the same solid feel that, say, the \\"Jurassic Park\\" dinosaurs have, but it works. They look more menacing, more bizarre this way. They are definitely not natural, and I think this is the point. The CG Manhattan that Kong is unleashed upon also has this dreamlike, less-than-solid feel: buildings and lights are hazy, sometimes in clearer focus than others, but this makes it a Manhattan that suits Kong: it may not have existed, but it is enticing - and a little scary - to think that it might have.<br /><br />The climactic scene is one of the best I can remember in films for some time. Planes circle Kong like vultures hovering over a doomed beast, while Ann makes a mad-dash attempt to get to him, though what exactly she could do is not clear. The reversion of the roles is striking: where once Kong protected her, now Ann desperately tries to protect him. When the inevitable happens, it has a quiet, deep emotional resonance that caught me by surprise, even though I had already grown to like the giant ape. I was shocked to discover that I was crying. \\"King Kong\\" is a movie of shocking beauty, passion, and impact.

B00000ILGX|3.0|I always seem to not realize why good and adequate acts, have albums that have tracks that are overshadowed, especially greatest hits albums. That has been the case with so many acts, no matter what the case is. For one of those artists of the 80's, Wham! with George Michael and Andrew Ridgely is no acception. Although they've had very gracious pop songs, they just have hit the nail on the head when it absolutely comes to a definitive hits package. Not only that, all of the greatest hits packages are released overseas, and not even one that is inexpensive for U.S. buyers. This package is almost the edge of heaven, but could've used more.<br /><br />The Best Of Wham!: If You Were There... Is a detailed reflection of one of the best teen acts of the 80's. The songs here have all been remastered and restored very well, for a much better sound quality. The album includes some great songs like The Edge Of Heaven, Young Guns (Go For It), Club Tropicana, and their catchy #1 smash Wake Me Up Before You Go Go. Nevertheless, while there are so many good songs here, there is always the feeling that something is completely overshadowed here. The collection does overlook a couple of great Wham! gems, surprisingly the mellow and beautifully conjured Careless Whisper, and Bad Boys from their very first album, instead of featuring remixed versions of some of their songs.<br /><br />This really isn't really a must buy for die hard George Michael fans, but considering there aren't any hits packages of Wham!! that'll ever be issued in the U.S. only right now, this might have to do. The Best Of Wham!: If You Were There... is a fair record, but not quite the edge of heaven.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Remastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: C

Sort of like a Jamaican Anthony Hamilton.  <br /> <br />It's hauntingly melodic.  His words open your eyes and mind to the things that really matter in life, peace love and unity and universal acceptance. I needed this album in my life. Believe me it will give you the soul healing rhythm that the music industry has been missing.  <br /> <br />No chiming over commercialized tracks about \\"bling\\" or \\"chip stacking\\". Just heart warming musical noursihment <br /> <br />From the powerful compelling intro on \\"Confrontation\\" to the reggae love tribute \\" There for you \\" ( I love this song! It moves your soul ) to the stirring political wake up call in the anthem \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\", Damien forces you to feel the passion and fire of the many people that struggle to live and love each day in Jamiaca.  <br /> <br />The production is handled with deft ability by his brother Stephen and it has just the right balance of reggae authenticity and commercial appeal. <br /> <br />This album is probably the best work of '05. A gauranteed classic.  I am a true fan and am just waiting for more from him.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|'Jaws' is one of the greatest films of all-time, bar none.  I can't imagine any reasonable excuse for not having seen it.  It perhaps takes a little too long to get them out on the ocean, we could stand for a little less small town corruption, I supppose, but the meat of it is so brilliant that it doesn't much matter.  The shark holds up very well considering how long ago it was, and the performances are first-rate, with particular note going to Robert Shaw as Quint, with his deservedly legendary monologue regarding his experiences on the sea in World War 2.<br /><br />This film works as drama, adventure and horror, and is still Spielberg's best film.  'Nuff said.
B00005YU1O|3.0|This film reminded me to obey an important maxim: you should not write a review of a film that you have only watched the first fifteen minutes of, unless, of course, the film is fifteen minutes long. And this film is much longer than fifteen minutes--much longer. Like other reviewers here, within the first minutes, I started writing a review in my head because I immediately disliked this film--didn't hate it (after all, it did occassionally have some interesting animation)--but was aesthetically repulsed by it's monotone cerebral rambling. It's like the mouth of some really boring philosophy PhD. is a baton that is passed from one \\"animated\\" character to the next, and as soon as the mouth  of the new character opens, the same in-session bookish dissertation is continued unabated, dull character to dull--well, at best, semi-dull characters.    In my disgruntled state early on while watching this film, my armchair movie critic hat came on right away, and I immediately started to compare it to \\"My Dinner with Andre\\"--that wonderfully successful filmed philosophical conversation which, at the same time, also contained so much passion and humanity--qualities which the \\"Waking Life\\" is mostly devoid of. \\"Andre\\" was a story weighted with strong characters, with a beginning and a middle and an end, with rising action, humorous diversions, pathos, love, fear, a climax, and great moments of human-tethered insight and inspiration, all within a simple dinner conversation. It was a tour de force of philosophical musing by two very human characters grappling with great ideas within the confines of their own disappointments and highest aspirations. \\"Waking Life,\\" on the other hand, is suspended effluvia--some well-wrought ideas salvaged from the philosophical literature that ride in the airy upper recesses of the scholarly cerebrum.  These are characters who move through their world with their bodies doing a lot of walking and gesturing, but with their minds carried around on a neverending, and very verbose, speculation meathook. My eyes glazed, my hearing stopped--it's like when some sophmore aquaintance sits down at lunch with you and is spitting out some grandeloquent diatribe that got stimulated by a class, or a paper, or an episode of Star Trek. He's throwing things out with some newly unfettered verbal confidence and a newfound intellectual bicep, tossing in quotes from Kant and Satre and Kierkegaard, in one long heady monologue, and you've stopped trying to follow his train of thought as you sit there, arms crossed, smiling patronizingly. And while he wildly articulates his grand ideas, you are desperately calculating when and how to excuse yourself from this benedicto elucidatum.    This film's dream also stimulated a comparison in my mind to that famous case in the psychological literature of the man who lived with a metal spike that had accidentally gone through his brain, and parts of his consciousness became thereby separated.  This movie's dream would be that man's lucid left brain dream, with all his intellectual, rational left brain synapses firing but butting up against the spike and falling back in upon themselves only on the rational left side, never intercoursing with the right side of the brain--the side of the soul and the emotions and the personality. This dream is populated with a few latent remnants of the right side--the templates of character and storyline, but templates now only infused with content from the left ganglia. Spock might have liked this dream. It was an alien dream to me. I don't know the dream in this movie.  I know dreams about being chased, about realizing I've gone to class naked, about falling but not hitting the ground, and about unfinished passion with Uma Thurman. The dream in this movie is like some dis-sensational librarian's purgatory.    Well, patience is a virtue, they say, and this is a film for the virtuous.  It gets someplace, but it takes a long time getting there, and in the long getting-there, it acquires a certain pace, a certain timing. You don't even really need to listen closely to what the expounders are saying, you just need to catch their rythm, because it's the rythm of the film that goes to the higher place, and when it finally arrives at some very entertaining heights, at that point, you will really listen and catch a few mind expanders. In the end, the getting there may be worth it. My advice is to not try too hard to follow all the philosophizing.  You'll eventually lock on later in the movie, or maybe, just at the end, which is all you really need. Then after finishing it once,  you might be inclined to  review the film and lock in better with what's being said during second and third viewings.     It's not the great philosophical, experiential film that \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" is--which you must see if you haven't (and actually, you don't even have to watch \\"Andre,\\" you can with equal enjoyment, just listen to it--which is another very telling contrast between these two very different, but goal-similar films). \\"Waking Life\\" is what it is--something different, something attempted--and it's well enough to just allow it to be what it is and enjoy it despite the pain of first encounter. Whereas \\"Andre\\" is the chuckle and the \\"OM\\" of the wisened guru, \\"Waking Life\\" is the clever new mantra of the cute new priest--a new song which is rewarded by the guru with a wide loving smile and the enlightened affirmation, \\"not that, not that.\\"
B0000TB01Y|4.0|True, the concept is a brilliant one, but as the editorial review indicates, the songs get in the way of the story. The lyrics are typical of Broadway in that they tend to be very matter-of-fact, i.e. \\"I'm mad!\\" \\"I'm sad!\\" \\"We're mad and sad,\\" etc.<br /><br />But hey, if that's what Broadway fans go for, and it seems that they do, who am I to judge?
0553801503|4.0|I was a little nervous about the book after reading some of the reviews of the book...mostly because I was afraid to see Martin head down the Jordan path, but things were jumping out at me like \\"too many characters\\"; \\"not enough plot progression\\"; \\"boring\\"...but I had to find out for myself.<br /><br />While I did find a few things a little disappointing, overall I very much enjoyed the book. (BTW...I can't stop calling the book A Feast OF Crows. I just realized the actual title when I was typing it on this page. Sheesh.)<br /><br />While I can see an argument being made that some of the chapters were not essential to carrying the plot forward, most of the book helped to build the world up more for me. This is something I have been craving for in this series; characters that are so beloved or hated in an interesting world that I really didn't know much about. This book, while slower in action, fleshed out some of the areas of Westeros that did not get as much attention in the first three books. I particularly enjoyed following Brienne's quest, trying to bring honor to her world even as those around her flee from it. Jamie is always fun to follow, as he is such an interesting character. Arya and Sansa are starting to make their way as the shock of their new lives wears off. I never much worried for Arya, but it's nice to see Sansa begin to grow up. I think she's going to be quite a dangerous woman as the years progress. I enjoyed the politics in King's Landing for the most part, although watching Cersi melt down was a bit of a letdown. In the proceeding books she seemed smart as well as strong, but in this one she makes mistake after mistake for the sake of advancing her own cause...even taking into account her grief from her recent losses, I thought Martin owed her better. I know he won't end it here for her, but I just felt like her actions in this book were less than she was capable of.<br /><br />Another thing that struck me in this book was that there seemed to be talk of sex in this book, and I wasn't really sure if much of it was necessary. I'm not a prude, but I think sex in the fantasy genre should be woven into the story, and can easily be overdone. I never thought I'd say that about Martin, but I think it was overdone a bit.<br /><br />So, for Martin fans, all I can say is I think the book is good enough to recommend to everyone so that you can judge for yourself. It appears that people are falling all over the spectrum on this book, which is the next best thing to the book being universally hailed I suppose. Aside from the few drawbacks that I found, and they were minor, I was very happy with the book and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series.e talk of sex in this book, and I wasn't really sure if much of it was necessary.

6304806426|5.0|To me, the film's most compelling theme is how Almasy's personal determination to keep his promise to the injured Kathryn has tragic political implications, notably for his partner Maddox and for the spy/thief David Caravaggio.  Moving deftly back and forth in time, the narrative pulls a whole group of interesting characters into the web of \\"the English patient,\\" tracing cause and effect through episodes of love, danger, and death.  The performances are exceptional, with Ralph Fiennes at his brooding, intense best and the beautiful Juliette Binoche full of spunky life but also vulnerable angst.  My only complaint concerns how Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) seems on the verge of confronting/killing Almasy (Fiennes) several times in a rather unconnected manner.  It provides opportunities to drive forward the plot in the past but seems a little incoherent in terms of the \\"present\\" plotline.  Only in his one major--and quite harrowing--flashback sequence does Caravaggio really come to life for me.  But that's a minor quibble in the face of such a brilliantly developed film.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and the romantic score by Gabriel Yared adds a great deal of poignancy, particularly at the very end when we finally understand the full significance of the film's opening image.  I love, too, the final contrasting cuts between Amashy's doomed flight and Hannah's sunlit trip toward an unknown future.  It's the yin and yang of past and present, destruction and possibility.  Two types of viewers should avoid this film: philistines who identify with rather than laugh at Elaine and simple-minded cultural conservatives (who apparently miss the fact that illicit passion leads to dire consequences in this film).
B00005JO1Y|3.0|The movie should be 90 mins long and could be way more entertaining, physically possible, and believable.  Plus, making better use of the audience time and money.  Two small questions to the director and the screen writer(s) :  How could Ann Darrow survive the entire story without any significant injury, like, say, a broken spine or neck?  And how could Jack survive the rescue attempt by Jimmy the cabin boy, who never before in his life fire a gun, doing exactly that with his eyes closed even? <br /> <br />So, the quote I can think of is by Carl Denham, the director by Jack Black, goes somewhere along the line of : \\"You can see the eighth wonder and a piece of the uncharted corner of the world all for the price of an admission ticket.\\" <br /> <br />Yeah, right.  Whatever. <br /> <br />Aside from the weird and impossible stunts and special effects, the movie was average.  My vote for the best actor/actress in this movie goes to King Kong.  I know, he's made up, not real and such, but believe me, I enjoyed his presence on the big screen more than any other actor/actress.  <br /> <br />All in all, go and see it if you want to see Naomi Watts' big blue eyes swimming in tears, the rugged and handsome captain of the Venture or the cute cabin boy, Jimmy.  Other than that, wait for the DVD.
B00000K0DK|5.0|To appreciate Kane fully, I think you need some sense of both how it compared with films of its own day and how great its influence has been on subsequent cinema.  In 1941 there was simply nothing remotely close in American film to the narrative and technical complexity of Citizen Kane.  The very few American films since then of comparable ambition and technical brilliance (say, The Godfather Part II and Raging Bull) were not as groundbreaking or influential.  Kane developed so many aspects of filmmaking in such brilliant ways that I doubt it will ever be matched.  It would at least take a real genius to pull off a coup comparable to what Orson Welles accomplished in this film, when he was fresh to Hollywood and only 24 years old. <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|In 1966, Cream spearheaded the first wave of the British rock invasion and revolutionized the concept of the power trio. Their brief career, lasting only three years, left a musical legacy that exists to this day. Cream standards such as: \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" (track 19, encore), \\"Crossroads\\" (track 15), \\"White Room\\" (track 17), and \\"Badge\\" (track 8) grace the classic rock airwaves from coast to coast daily. Their live show set the standard for rock concerts for decades to follow. Ginger Baker was one of the first to incorporate double bass drums, extra toms and cymbals into a now familiar kit that would be imitated by a generation of rock drummers. Jack Bruce, schooled as a classical cellist, showed that a Marshall stack was not only for guitarists, and changed the role of the electric bass forever. Eric Clapton went on to become the preeminent blues-rock guitarist of our times.<br /><br />For those of us who remember Cream, their 2005 reunion, culminating in a four night engagement at London's Royal Albert Hall stirred anticipation from bar room to board room. For others too young to remember, this reunion is a heart warming lesson in the bonds of friendship, and musical mastery. Producers John Beug and James Pluta captured the best of Cream's set in a two-disc DVD package that no fan, young or old can afford to miss. The package and accompanying song list resembles a flower-powered, psychedelic painted Volkswagen bus. Yet this cosmetic debauchery cannot mask the sound and visual artistry within.<br /><br />The 19-song set, consisting of mostly Cream hits, and a few blues covers (with three alternate takes) highlights the second, third and final nights' performances. Brief, interviews of all three band members, round out the package. Although oscillating from show to show disrupts the continuity of watching one performance from beginning to end, this tactic is not too annoying. The producers wisely chose to utilize the three-way split screen effect sparingly. Audience shots and brief views of the inner bowls of the historic Royal Albert Hall are weaved together, and inserted tastefully.  Yet it is the honesty and integrity of the musicians on stage that leave the viewer spellbound and breathless.<br /><br />The band opens with an awkward rendition of their hit \\"I'm So Glad.\\" Bruce, shorter than we remember, dons a beautiful red mahogany vintage Gibson EB-1, the violin-shaped bass popularized by the late Felix Pappalardi of Mountain. Bruce will play this instrument for half the DVD, before switching to a fretless Warwick, his axe of choice in recent years. Clapton, wearing brand new, off the rack denims and \\"Wallabies(?)\\" looks scruffy in a four-day growth of beard.  Baker, the oldest of the three at 66, wears jeans (rolled up to the knee, an old trademark) Cream tee-shirt, and a pair of Oxfords in dyer need of a shine. He looks more like one's grandfather, than a rock legend. Beautiful A cappella vocal harmonies by Clapton and Bruce in the bridge, soon remind the audience, that despite outward appearances, the old Cream magic is still there.<br /><br />Bruce's crisp vocal range, responsible for Cream's distinct sound, is quite evident in Willie Dixon's \\"Spoonful\\" (track 2). Originally running over six minutes, this piece exhibits the band's standard formula built upon a riff, and basic blues progression. Clapton's long, soul searching guitar solo, backed by improvisational jamming and thunderous rhythms by Bruce and Baker, provide the template for \\"Politician\\" (track 8), \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" (track 13), and \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" (track 16).<br /><br />Clapton's slow hand is surely felt on Arthur Baker's \\"Outside Woman's Blues\\" (track 3), and T-Bone Walker's immortal \\"Stormy Monday\\" (track 11). Bruce blows a mean blues harp, and gets the normally subdued London audience dancing in the aisles with Muddy Water's \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" (track 10). Nicely arranged vocal harmonies between Bruce and Clapton on Bruce'sown \\"Sleepy Time Time\\" (track 5) provide one of the show's highlights.<br /><br />Bruce's unique song writing, arrangement, and singing styles are further evident in \\"We're Going Wrong\\" (track 14), \\"N.S.U.\\" (track 6), and \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" (track 12). Baker's less known writing contributions are displayed in \\"Sweet Wine\\" (track 9), while \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" (track 4) is resurrected in Baker's gruff deep baritone speaking voice. It is on \\"Toad\\" (track 18), the compulsory drum solo, where Baker confirms he is still the founding father of rock/jazz drummers.  This solo is breath-taking, meticulous, and never is a misjudged rim shot or stick clashing in mid-air to be heard. At 66, Baker unequivocally reaffirmed his place at the pinnacle of his profession.<br /><br />There are several moments of pure fun, on stage. \\"You're just trying to make me nervous,\\" declares Baker, after Clapton introduced Peter Edward Baker, before \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog.\\" Bruce smiles broadly at Baker, for following his up-scale bass line with machine-gun tom-toms, and both miraculously came back in time. Then, Bruce and Clapton acknowledge a smile and a nod after a satisfying performance.<br /><br />There are slight imperfections as well. In \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" (alternate take), Clapton starts to sing a verse too early, as Bruce glances over and smiles forgivingly. Bruce, likewise misses a bass cue in \\"N.S.U.\\", and more than once, Baker finishes a drum roll two early, and waits motionless for his band mates to catch up. One critique is the slower tempo of \\"Crossroads.\\" Bruce just did not attack those now classic bass runs, as he did in the original version. Though professing that \\"we wanted to play as we do now, not as we did then,\\" I wanted Bruce to set his fret board on fire.

B000301YY8|3.0|I first heard James Blunt late 2004 from the talk of a music discussion board.  The songs I heard were High and You're beautiful.  The lyrics are not the most profound, the falsetto (not too many voices can do this well)takes some getting used to, but I loved the melodies.  He caused quite a stir in th UK, but I did not think he would make it in the US music scene. No doubt the push from VH1 helped.  His voice is more comfortable for me now...yeah he grew on me...so I will stick to 3 stars.  I'm not that upset I purchased this.
B00004YYDI|3.0|I watched this under the recommendation that it was similar to [[ASIN:B00005JN0W Man on Fire]] (2004), but much, much, much better. Well it's nothing like Man on Fire, so I'll judge this movie as it stands on its own. It stands as well as any peg legged person would.<br /><br />The bond between Creasy and Pita was very believable, the bond between Leon and Mathilda is contrived and awkward. From the outset, I didn't buy that this little Mathilda girl has this burning passion and dedicated devotion to become a hit-man just like Leon. What little girl even thinks like that? Also, what makes her sooo interested in him anyway? I'm talking about before he rescued her, what was it about him that she was so attracted to? It makes no sense.<br /><br />Obviously if Mathilda didn't want to be a hit-man, we would have no movie. Had they justified this motivation in a more believable manner, I would've bought it. And no, her family being murdered (including her brother who she was close with) doesn't count. I don't buy \\"becoming a hit-man\\" as a believable emotional response for a 12 year old girl. If they wanted to make it realistic, they should've had her desire to be a hit-man be more of a passing interest, as sort of a passionate raw response to having her family murdered. A lot of kids show interest in whatever it is that is current in their minds at the time, but unless it's something that they are naturally interested in, or are forced to do, they probably won't follow through with the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in some random craft thrown at them (and why should they, you think you can get a 12 year old girl to all of a sudden show daily dedication in say, becoming a car mechanic, without any persuasion to do so?)<br /><br />Here's what they should've done: After her family is killed, have her still want to exact revenge, but what should change is her character's desire to *continue* training to be a hit-man, because that single flaw is what throws this whole premise off the balcony. I would have her eventually try to give up on this idea after realizing what a dark world she's gotten herself into, only to have Leon not allow her back out of her commitment. The manner in which Leon reacts to this and the degree to which he goes to prevent her cop out would be determined by how you would want to portray his character. There could be many interesting possibilities with this sort of idea, by showing a realistic shades of grey character.<br /><br />One final thing, so many people said how Gary Oldman was so great in this, and squealing with delight about how his quirky performance was just so wonderful. The man's FACE bothered me the entire movie. The way he played that character was very annoying, not to mention unrealistic to the type of disposition a person that made it to his position would have.alcony.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Much, much, better than I expected.  Though a 5 star rating by 1800+ folks does raise your expectations a bit ;-)<br /><br />My background:  I love SciFi, but more so in books than in films.  I have especially low expectations for TV series.  It hurts me to see my favorite genre get mangled time after time by humanoid aliens that look like made-up humans, cheesy special effects and fake-looking sets.  The worst: bad plots that rely on techy pseudo-babble (as spoofed by GalaxyQuest).  Good SF films can overcome these problems, but,  over the long term, TV series always seem to lack the budget and/or good screenplays.<br /><br />But having liked Serenity-the-movie and read some of the reviews here, I figured I'd give Firefly-the-series a try.<br /><br />Firefly was an amazingly pleasant surprise!  The CGI special effects are very well done, but mostly limited to external views of the ship.  They are used sparingly and there are no space battle scenes to speak of.  The ship itself is very believable, in the same way that the Nostromo (Alien) was:  it looks worn, lived-in and patched together.  In short it looks like a typical big piece of machinery, not an oversized plastic toy.<br /><br />Firefly is concerned with the relationship of humans on poor frontier planets to a central government.  So it opts for a Wild-West theme which is long on atmosphere and realism but short on flashy gadgets. The frequent use of Chinese hints at some interesting political history as well...<br /><br />Beyond the unexpectedly good production quality, the crew is what really makes the series.  Each has his/her own quirks and each episode gives you some more insight into what makes them tick.  My personal favorite being Jayne, as he is such a dumb moron.  There might be a good side to him, somewhere, but the series goes out of its way to always knock him off his pedestal whenever you start to like him.  Oh, and Kaylee is a real hottie!<br /><br />Other reviewers have already written about the depth and subversive nature of the main plotline so there is no need to repeat those points.line so there is no need to repeat those points.
B0002P18GI|5.0|And I can't find anything that I don't like about it. I was given this movie last Christmas because I told my in-laws that I wanted to see it. I was surprised to get it, but grateful all the same. I didn't sit down to watch it until earlier this year. At the time I thought, \\"This is strange, but good, I guess.\\" I didn't appreciate it at first. Then one night in November I thought I'd watch it again, just for the hell of it. I fell in love with this movie. As soon as I got to a computer, I started looking up all I could about the movie. It is a fantastic movie, made even better if you can follow it. I fell in love with Kate Winslet more for her role as Clementine than Rose. And Jim Carrey, already my favorite actor, deserved an Oscar nomination and win for Joel. It was his best role ever. The supporting cast doesn't dissappoint either. Tom Wilkinson is particularly superb as the creator of the mind-erasure process. I highly recommend this movie, and if you are unfortunate enough to not be able to follow it, then I feel sorry for you.
1558216847|1.0|In The Long Walk, Slavomir Rawicz tells the story of his escape from a WWII Soviet prison camp and his long walk to freedom.  The story is gripping, even painful at times; but it has one major problem: it is probably not a true story.    This book's genesis came when a British reporter in the 1950s was doing research on Yeti sightings and came across Slavomir Rawicz, who claimed to have seen an unidentified \\"monster\\" after escaping from a Soviet prison camp.  After meeting with Rawicz, the reporter realized that the story of Rawicz's escape is a much better story and helps Rawicz write the story of the escape and long trek.    Although the impetus of the story should raise some doubts with the reader (a Yeti sighting), because the book is billed as \\"the True Story of a Trek to Freedom,\\" the reader quickly becomes engrossed in the story.  Rawicz was a Polish Army officer captured by the Germans at the beginning of World War II and sent to a work camp deep in Siberia.  Rawicz and some companions engineered an escape, and for the next year they traveled southward trying to escape Soviet Russia.  At times they were at the verge of starvation, and the reader cannot help but feel real pain when Rawicz tells of the companions who died along the trip, but they persevered through the cold of Siberia and the heat of the Gobi desert before finally meeting some British soldiers in India.      It's a real triumph - but, it's likely not true.  As Anne Applebaum points out in her Pulitzer Prize-winning history Gulag, most experts who have examined this story find it \\"unconvincing.\\"  No one has been able to locate any records from Rawicz's time as a prisoner, and one of the leading Russian historians of the Gulag carried on correspondence with Rawicz and does not believe his story.  [EDIT:  In October 2006, the BBC found some records that show that Rawicz was a prisoner in the Gulag but was released by the NKVD and sent to a refugee camp in Iran.  He did not escape and flee with asmall band of ex-prisoners through the frozen wastelands of Siberia or through the Gobi Desert en route to India.]  The fact that many want to believe this inspiring story shouldn't overcome the fact that experts who have corresponded with the author, who have searched for his records, and who have seriously considered the details of his escape, do not believe this story.    This book's power lies in the premise that it's a true story; but if you take that away, it's just a hoax that has been played on generations of readers.

B000003TA4|5.0|Can you believe it has been nearly 14 years since this multi platinum album hit the shelves?Nevermind is one of those true classic albums, right up in the ranks with \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" and even \\"SGT.Peppers\\".Nevermind has a variety of speedy punk pace songs to slow heavy grungy melodies.Nevermind basically introduced us to the world of grunge and since then many bands have followed.(Breaking Benjamin,The Vines,Bush)<br /><br />Many of Nirvana's radio hits came off this album.Such as \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\",\\"Come As You Are\\",\\"Lithium\\",In-Bloom\\"and \\"On A Plain\\".Although \\"On A Plain\\" was never a single it still got some air play.Of those listed songs, no one can forget how \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" became the teen angst ridden anthem of the 90's.Whats nice about Nevermind is the fact that you can pop it in today and it will still sound as crisp as it did back in the day.(Wich really wasn't that long ago).A slower but notable song \\"Something In The Way\\" is introduced on this album and is a depressing conclusion to such a powerful album.\\"Polly\\"is an acoustic ballad and has a haunting but soft tone to it.\\"Territotial Pissings\\"is flaunting a punk sound.<br /><br />Nirvana ,with the help of Butch Vig, produced one timeless classic never falling short of dullness.This is a must have if you like music period.
0679422714|5.0|As a US Foreign Service Officer in the first major city to be taken <br />by the future Mao regime, we were asked by Secretary of State George Marshall to explore the attitude of the new regime toward the US.  The senior Communist officials in the region welcomed our offer to remain as consular officials, promoting trade and mutual understanding.  Mao, on Soviet demand, put us under house arrest, and altered the course of history:  Mao already had the Korean invasion in mind, a year before, and agreed on it with Stalin, so the Korean war was really an invasion by the Communist Internationale.   <br />This masterpiece of history discloses a myriad of secrets unknown to American authorities, and shows how little the present success of China owes to Mao, and how much his missteps cost the world. A <br />better primer for understanding modern China could hardly be imagined.  I was a participant in those events and know first hand of what I speak.
6305014140|2.0|I heard from the net from many people this was the best anime movie out there so I decided to see it. <br /> <br />Well this movie is old and I would probably say this movie was the best movie on it's time but not no more cause I thought of the story being lame but the movie was more focused on the action scenes which I may say they do I alright job when it comes to action scenes. <br /> <br />But if you like a some great action scenes, sex, weak story then go and rent it and see if you might like it. <br /> <br />2 stars is what I give it cause really not even average to what anime movies can reach at these days. Cause I expect more in anime movies than hollywood movies. But if I were to rate this movie when it had came out probably a 4.0 out of 5.0 but these days story and characters are big parts in anime that should grip you and let you go when the movie ends. <br /> <br />Verdict: 2.1 out of 5.0  An alright movie to see in the weekends if you are bored but when you want to see something good look elsewhere.
B00005JOFO|5.0|It's a wierd time for America. A conservative hoodlum is in the White House, a $200 million blockbuster about a giant ape is the top film at the box office, and the main film critics and moviegoers with any kind of sense are talking about is a quiet love story between two cowboys in the Wyoming mountains playing in a handful of theatres. Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, based on the tragic short story by Annie Proulx, is worth the hype. It is a startling film about the connection between two lonely souls in the bleak landscape of the midwest. Heath and Jake have amazing chemistry which slowly pulls you into the film but eventually turns you inside out as their relationship grows darker. Love, homosexuality, prototypes of machismo, these are all dealt with with rare restraint and sensitivity by Lee as a compassionate but almost indifferent observer. It is only in the film's final shot, and Ennis' final weary line that the power of this story becomes apparent. This is a film which needs to be seen. It is the film of the year.
1878424319|5.0|It's not that I hate them per se; it's that they cause my eyes to glaze over. I think the majority of them are a waste of good trees. But, there are also many that, while I would not read them, do provide something for someone. This was the first one that I read cover to cover and would truly recommend.<br /><br />The good (majority) reviews say it all. I'd just like to address a few of the negative ones.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have noted that they got all the info they needed from the inside front cover. That's true. The inside of the book obviously goes into more detail, but the gist of the agreements are contained on the cover. For the reviewers who say the message is good but the book is too long, I say \\"So what? It's only 10 stinkin' dollars.\\" Honestly, if you even get something positive out of reading the cover, then it is worth the $10. Of course you could just go to the web site and read the same info there. (Actually, I might recommend that before reading the book anyway.)<br /><br />Some reviewers complained that it was too simple. Well, yeah. That's sort of the idea. Or that it was too obvious. Yet, it is amazing how many people don't clue in on these concepts. Simple concepts, yes. But try seriously integrating the 4-agreements into your life and you may meet more of a challenge.<br /><br />A few reviewers said it was \\"new agey\\"... the fact that they used the term \\"New Agey\\" was an obvious sign they weren't going to enjoy it in the first place. People who use that phrase tend to be a little narrow-minded (or else have a stick up their a$$.)<br /><br />One negative reviewer made some very good points regarding personal responsibility. In the book, Ruiz tells us not to take things personally -- that things aren't our fault. The reviewer saw this as a way to avoid personal responsibility. She says \\"sometimes it IS about you. Sometimes we do something wrong and this makes the people around us justifiably angry. In that case it IS about us and we DO need to change our behavior.\\" What she may have missed -- and something Ruiz stresses in the book -- is that taken by themselves, these ideas will not work. They MUST all be practiced together. In other words, if you really ARE doing your best, and being impeccable with your word, and not making assumptions, then you are not doing anything wrong that could invite blame. There is a definite self-examination involved in this process.<br /><br />The same reviewer suggested readers delve into the deeper and more classical works such as \\"Chuang Tzu, The Rule of St. Benedict, The Cloud of Unknowing, Julian's Showings, Teresa of Avila.\\" Good ideas, but not for everyone.<br /><br />Honestly, if you are happy with your life, don't read this book. It will do nothing for you. If you are a conservative evangelical Christian, you probably won't want to read this book. If you have a degree in philosophy, religion, or literature, don't read this book. But, if you want a simplified, stripped-down, easy read, easy to remember, philosophy for living, this is a great book.s and we DO need to change our behavior.\\" What she may have missed -- and something Ruiz stresses in the book -- is that taken by themselves, these ideas will not work.

0553213105|5.0|When I first started reading Pride and Prejduice, I was 13 years old, and didn't understand it much. The vivid and detailed literature with underlying hints of sarcasm didn't make me laugh because I was illiterate to the writing at the time. I had even resorted to cliffs notes and such to help me through the book, even though I was reading it on my own accord. Now that I am older and far more wise, i read this book and love the romance, social placings and every moral connected to this book, but the male sex will turn up their noses to this amazing novel because it will be \\"too girly\\" for them. READ THIS BOOK!
B00000G5VI|5.0|The Buddha Of Suburbia probably would have gotten as much attention as Outside, if this hadn't have been a soundtrack to a mini-series. It's a shame that it didn't get the attention it deserved, because it's every bit as good as Outside. This CD sort of reminds me of Low and Heroes, because it's a combination of instrumentals, soundscapes, and songs with lyrics. The sound is completely different from those two, though. This one kind of has a jazzy/egyptian sound to it. It's hard to explain.    The soundscape \\"The Mysteries\\" really stands out from the rest, because it's the only one that doesn't have the jazz or egyptian sound. \\"The Mysteries\\" can give you this really great feeling. Imagine being alone on an island with just your girlfriend or boyfriend and watching the sun rise. It gives you that sort of feeling. Even though I really like that one, I think the title track is still my favorite. It blew me away when I first listened to it, and it still blows me away. It might be Bowie's best song of the 90's. \\"Buddha Of Suburbia\\" is right up there with the songs \\"Life on Mars?\\" \\"Wild Eyed Boy From Free Cloud,\\" \\"Teenage Wildlife,\\" etc. I also really like \\"Strangers When We Meet,\\" and think it's just as good as the redone version on Outside. Some people would disagree with me because it doesn't have the piano playing in it, but I think Bowie sings it better on this.     I could go on and on about this CD. Every single track is either perfect, or real close to it. You should definitley try to get a copy of this, or even download the songs if you have to.
B00005JOFO|5.0|At long last after one of the longest and best orchestrated promotions, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" opened on a limited showing, which I believe translates into art houses in large cities. Even in Atlanta, Georgia it is now playing in one midtown theatre in a neighborhood where there are more rainbow flags visible than flannel shirts.<br /><br />The film is beautiful to watch if a bit too long. That is to be expected since Mr. Lee had the task of fleshing out a short story into a two hour movie. It is easier to express passage of time with two sentences than on the big screen with two characters who essentially are nonverbal, a second problem as the director had to show a lot of what was going on between the two lead actors with only body language and facial expressions. Additionally, in the short story by Annie Proulx that Mr. Lee and Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based this movie on the men are not particularly attractive. For instance, in the Proulx account Jack Twist has buckteeth; there ain't nothing buckteeth about Jake Gyllenhaal's smile. He is almost too handsome although he does put on weight as the years pass by.<br /><br />These are minor complaints, however. The movie should not be missed, not only by gay audiences but by the rest of America as well. Both lead actors do a fine job as do the minor characters, particularly Jack Twist's wife. The message is clear: in 1963 in Wyoming-- as in the rest of America-- two masculine \\"Malboro\\" men could not have had an open relationship. If they had been hairdressers and town outcasts, maybe. On the other hand, love in whatever form it takes is not to be missed. Isn't that what living is all about anyway?<br /><br />While Mr. Lee, who by the way, is one of our best and most innovative directors-- he never repeats himself-- deviates some from Proulx's story, he keeps the essence of it. In the very end of the movie he adds a poignant touch by having Ennis hang his shirt outside Jack's on the same hanger in his closet, something, as I recall, he does not do in the story.<br /><br />The soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of \\"He Was A Friend of Mine.\\"<br /><br />We can only hope that the movie gets to a wide audience in Wal-Mart and K-Mart land, where these two men and their families lived.et, something, as I recall, he does not do in the story. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of \\"He Was A Friend of Mine.\\" <br /> <br />We can only hope that the movie gets to a wide audience in Wal-Mart and K-Mart land, where these two men and their families lived.
B00001OH7M|5.0|It seems like a lot of people I know say that Hunky Dory is David Bowie's 1st masterpiece. I always disagree with them and say that it's his 3rd masterpiece, because Space Oddity and The Man Who Sold The World come very close to being just as good! Anyway, Space Oddity is like listing to Bob Dylan, T. Rex, and Roxy Music all on the same CD. It's half folk, half glam, and the results are absolutely jaw dropping. Bowie is one of very few artists that can combine two different genres of music into one and make it sound brilliant, let alone good!  <br /> <br />My personal favorites on here are \\"Space Oddity,\\" \\"Cygnet Committee,\\" \\"An Occasional Dream,\\" \\"Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud,\\" and \\"Memory of a Free Festival,\\" especially \\"Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud!\\" I love that song and I always play it around three times until I move on to \\"God Knows I'm Good.\\" Man, that would be so cool he'd do just one more folk/glam rock album. I really like the new stuff he's been doing, but nothing beats folk and glam!
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spiderman and Spiderman 2 are two fast action movies which hinge on the implausible.  Realizing that we can look at the movies with a great suspension of belief.  Of course there is some debate over which kiss was better but I prefer the one in 2 at the end.  It is one of the greatest film kisses in the history of film.  When Mary J. says go get em tiger you know that he and she will be married in the next film when it is made.  It is every lonely mans dream to have a good women kiss him and tell him to go get em.  The green goblin in the first one and Doc Ock in the second one are suitably nasty.  Of course we have to realize that the actor who was nasty in the first one started his career as Jesus Christ in King of Kings.  What a contrast for them to make from one actors career.  But, this is a very good film and worth your time to watch.  Sit back and open up your soda, put the bowl of popcorn on the table and get comfortable.  You're in for a real good time with your feet up on the coffee table.  You won't fall asleep.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|Mildly entertaining, but what a shame that the director didn't exercise some self-control while editing this somewhat bloated movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high after what Jackson had accomplished with his Tolkien trilogy.

B0001L3MI0|4.0|This is half a fantastically great movie, and half tiered old disaster movie tripe, specifically the first half is tripe; the same old unstoppable aliens flatten every major city with a myriad of F\X, kind of movie.<br /><br />Now, the second half is worth Jeff Goldblum's weight in gold.<br />Really, it's that awesome. the play between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is fantastic.<br />The plot brightens up too, the use of a computer virus was on the clever side, it is logical to think that the aliens would run their ships completely on computer, however, that Windows and Alien hardware would be in the least bit compatible is a stretch, but, who cares?! It's a movie.<br /><br />Defiantly a film to see, the second half that is.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|If You are a true fan of '80s Pop/Rock, This will probably take you back. This is the SAME Madonna who gave us hits Like \\"Borderline\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" Those great hits made have changed ourselves from Kids to Grown-Ups in 20 years. Somehow, Madonna has really think outside the box, and cooked up some new music that Still have the same chemistry 20 years ago. She is now 47 years old, and I still listened to her after all these years. It pays to have a better life-by listening to Top-40. Now, we have kids, and they are listening to Madonna as we speak, and Madonna is'nt the hot chick like she was 20 years ago.
B000001FGG|4.0|When they released their third album in June of 1968, Cream decided to something a bit different.  \\"Wheels of Fire\\" was a double-album, which was rare enough in those days, but one album was recorded in the studio and the other featured live performances.  For me the results are mixed and \\"Wheels of Fire\\" ends up being rated four stars because I can just about divide the fourteen tracks in half between three star and five star songs.  Reduce the double-album to a single one with five studio tracks on the \\"A\\" side and two live tracks on the \\"B\\", and you just might have the best Cream album of all.  Fortunately, this is a lot easier to do with a CD.<br /><br />Side \\"A\\" still starts off with \\"White Room,\\" written by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, and a song that features the power trio at their psychadelic best (you clearly have to be on drugs to make sense of the lyrics).  Then we skip ahead to the next Bruce & Brown song, \\"As You Said,\\" which offers Eric Clapton on acoustic guitar.  The other biggie from the first disc is the cover of Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" which offers one of Bruce's best vocal performances.  Then it is back to Bruce & Brown for \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart.\\"  In case you have not figured out the common denominator here, the rule of thumb is to skip the songs co-written by Ginger Baker (\\"Passing the Time\\" starts off rather interesting and then goes off into the land of the glockenspiel), which means since I need one more track to account for most of what is here I will go back and throw in \\"Sitting on the Top of the World\\" because of the base line, even though it a bit like a high school band trying to learn how to play the blues at times. Actually, what I want to do is include \\"Anyone for Tennis,\\" the song Clapton co-wrote for the film \\"The Savage Seven,\\" but it is not on this particular version of \\"Wheels of Fire.\\"  If it were, then substitute it for \\"Sitting.\\"<br /><br />Side \\"B\\" for this one is really simple.  The live version of Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroad\\" deserves the accolade of being definitive and gets the flip off to as strong of a start as the first.  Then you can let the rest of side be the 16:45 performance of Willie Dixon's \\"Spoonful\\" where the band proves their bona fides in the realm of improvisation.  Even if you are listening to the album straight through without the suggested deletions, you are still urged to end with this track ringing in your ears because the rest of the album is way down hill from here.f Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroad\\" deserves the accolade of being definitive and gets the flip off to as strong of a start as the first.

B000BPCCZA|4.0|I've never heard of a cd that doesn't work with all cd players. I was disappointed to find out that my home player won't play it. I think they should make a law that says in order for bands/producers to sell their cd's, they should make it work on all cd players. Luckily, it works on my portable cd player. I haven't tried the one at work yet, but I'm crossing my fingers. Otherwise, GREAT!!
0452282152|1.0|I had read other of Chevalier's books and enjoyed them. I also love Vermeer so I was looking forward to reading this book. <br /> <br />I was so disappointed. The writing is dull and plodding. <br /> <br />My main problem with the book is the portrayal of the characters. I am reading this book feeling very uncomfortable how members Vermeer's family are described. I cannot help feeling that the book is being totally unfair on Vermeer's wife Catharina. Anything I read suggests that she was a Dutch housewife devoted to family not the idle would be lady of the book. We may know nothing of Vermeer's daughter Cordelia but she may have been a lovely girl not the little madam of this book.  <br /> <br />I expected to be enthralled and even uplifted but was left with an unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling. <br />
B000001F76|5.0|It really doesn't get any better than Hank Williams. And, this is a superb collection. If you already have many Hank Williams CDs, you may want to look at the list of songs. If you are considering your first Hank Williams collection, you won't go wrong by buying this one.
B00005JO04|4.0|This is a complex film.  It's hard to follow.  And at the end I had the feeling that it was too short, which is very unusual for me.<br /><br />I have no idea what the name of the film is supposed to mean.  The situations depicted are supposedly fictional although they are based on some real issues - oil, money, politics, the Middle East crisis, and corruption.  There are a lot of characters, many of whom never meet each other, but whose every action effects everything else.  George Clooney is one of the stars.  He plays a CIA agent.  We know he's a paid assassin who is fluent in Farsi and sells bombs. But we're never sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy. And when he, himself is double-crossed and is subjected to torture, we cannot help but feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Matt Damon's character is also confusing.  We're never sure of what his business is but he and his family live a good life in a Middle Eastern country.  When he is invited to the home of a Sheik to talk business, his young son is involved in a horrible accident.  Somehow, this gives him leverage in his dealings with the Sheik, but his wife now accuses him of selling out.<br /><br />Then there are the two Middle Eastern princes.  At first we dislike them both, but as the film moves along we get a sense of the competition between them.  One brother makes a deal with the Americans which will likely be a disaster for his country.  The other brother's ideals of long-range planning for the country are dashed.  But these plans include a deal with China.<br /><br />To complicate even more, there are two American oil companies, one of which is owned by Chris Cooper, which are merging in order to buy drilling rights in another Middle Eastern country.  But whether there is oil where they will be drilling is questionable.  There are a lot of American government investigations going on but the lawyers are all slick and corrupt and none of these investigations every resolve anything.<br /><br />And then there is the young \\"guest worker\\" in the oil-rich country who is pulled into religious fanaticism.<br /><br />Confused?<br /><br />It took me a while to get it but Syriana is SUPPOSED to be confusing.  This concept is endemic to the screenplay.  Basically the combination of politics and oil in the Middle East is one great big confusing labyrinth.  There are no easy answers.  In fact, there are no answers at all.  Everyone is a bad guy.  And everyone is connected to each other in some way.  They never realize it though as each one views the world from his own perspective.<br /><br />When the film was over, I wondered what the plot was about and really thought I had missed something.  And then I heard someone seated behind me ask her companion to explain the plot. I understand that professional reviewers were given a written outline of the plot before they reviewed the film.  I sure I wish I had had a roadmap like this.  But I also really think that it would have narrowed my perspective.  The reality of the film is that Middle Eastern politics are so complicated that there is no real understanding and hence, no solution.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this film.  I am sure it will confuse you too.

B000002B1M|4.0|The second album is always a tricky one, it is always difficult to follow up a good debut, but following up a classic like Illmatic is basically impossible.  It Was Written is a good effort, it is not on the level of Illmatic though, there is some filler material on here.<br /><br />At the time of release It Was Written received a fair amount of criticism, most of it unfair.  When you look back at this  without comparing it to Illmatic, it is actually a very good album, especially compared to his next two releases.  After the intro comes The Message, one of the best tracks on the album, that is followed by Street Dreams, another great song which uses the same sample as Tupac's All Eyez On Me.  Other favourite songs are Affirmative Action, which was the first song by the firm (Nas, AZ, Cormega, Foxy Brown) including Cormega, who didn't feature in their album because of an eventual beef with Nas.  The Dr Dre produced Nas Is Coming is a great track as is I Gave You Power, where Nas describes a series of events through the point of view of a gun.  Also like Shootouts and the hit song If I Ruled The World ft Lauryn Hill, most of the other tracks are at least decent, though a few fall under the skip category (Black Girl Lost, The Set Up).<br /><br />Overall a good album from Nas, certainly better than the two that followed, don't believe anyone who says Nas fell off when he released this, it puts most other rappers work to shame.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|I'm not quite sure what Peter Jackson was going for with the performances. I understand the film is a throwback to the original but I don't think having the actor's perform the way they did in 1933 helped the picture in any way, shape or form.  <br /> <br />The relationship between Ann Darrow and Brody's character is non-existent, forced, stupid, with absolutely no real human connection. Jack Black is atrocious- moving your eyebrows a lot is not good acting, in case he didn't know.  <br /> <br />The sort of pederastic relationship between Jimmy and his big friend was weird and absurd.  <br /> <br />The writing... an insult to anyone's intelligence. <br />  <br />If special effects could make a movie, I would give it five stars, but it can't, so I won't. At least Peter lost a lot of weight making it!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West's debut album The College Dropout was released last year to much fanfare, the media hyped him as the saviour of Hip Hop (It didn't need saving in my opinion), and overall he delivered a good debut.  Now i'm not hating, I do like this album, as the 4 stars suggests, however Kanye as a rapper is way overated.  Lyrically he is probably a little above average by today's standards but his flow is awkward and pretty bad.  If you listen, most of the featured rappers on the album clearly outshine him (Jay-Z, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Freeway etc..), I do rate him highly as a producer though, although I prefered some of his previous work (The Blueprint especially).<br /><br />First time I heard Kanye rapping was on Through The Wire, which is a track I love, and after hearing Slow Jamz with Twista and All Falls Down I decided to buy the album.  His next single was of course Jesus Walks, possibly the best song on the album, however I can't believe he thinks he's the first person to ever rap about Jesus, is that a joke?  I've heard tons of rappers talk about religion and Jesus, yet he makes out he's a pioneer, an example of Kanye's ego that sometimes annoy's me.  I'm going off subject however, other good tracks are Spaceship, Two Words ft Mos Def & Freeway, Family Business and I also like the experimental New Workout Plan. Most of the album is good, though there are a few filler tracks, and far too many skits, 7 in all, which out of 21 tracks is ridiculous.<br /><br />This is a good album, well worth buying, however I can't understand people calling it a classic.  With his limited rapping ability I don't think Kanye could ever drop a classic, just listen to the featured artists, nearly all of them steal the show from him.  In fact featuring so many other rappers probably raises the standard of the album overall.  I do have some problems with Kanye though, the media ridiculously hype him up, like he's the first conciencious rapper ever (he's not, in fact he's not even the best today, listen to Mos Def & Talib Kweli).  Also his ego annoy's me, especially when he's not really a talented rapper, these reasons are why I feel a lot of people give this album 1&2 star reviews.  However despite my opinions on Kanye, this is a solid debut, well produced and with many good tracks, don't expect the best album ever though.the best today, listen to Mos Def & Talib Kweli).  Also his ego annoy's me, especially when he's not really a talented rapper, these reasons are why I feel a lot of people give this album 1&2 star reviews.

B000BMSTMS|1.0|I have every album. Seen Korn live twice in Portland Maine and Keflavik Iceland. This album sucks. I bought this album for a friend who is stationed in Japan as a Christams gift. I actually felt bad that I sent him this crap after I pushed myself to listen to the CD 4 times. 4 times to actully verify that it is a garbage CD. Junk I say, Issues part 2. I hope this is the end for Korn. I can't take another disapointment. Very unfortunate that this is what has happend to a once nasty, hard charged group of guys. <br /> <br />VR <br /> <br />Mr. T <br />USN
B00003CXC6|4.0|RASHOMON was a groundbreaking film for its time, one that called into question whether or not we can really know the \\"truth\\" behind anything since everyone's viewpoint is limited to their own subjective personality.  The film recounts the same incident from different viewpoints, taking a bold narrative approach that would greatly influence filmmakers for several years, even up to this very day. <br /> <br />While I feel there are some parts of the film that don't hold up very well, overall the movie has a very powerful effect at the end as everything finally comes to a head.   <br /> <br />For some interesting comparisons to RASHOMON, I would suggest the Paul Newman flick, THE OUTRAGE (1964), and Italian director Mario Bava's ultra-rare obscurity, FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT (1969), which puts a campy, erotic spin on the material.

0895260131|5.0|Notwithstanding its whimsical title, and the pop culture format of this book, it is one of the most important books you are likely ever to read.  Western culture and Western values are under attack from the followers of an amoral \\"prophet,\\" and Robert Spencer has both the spine and the facts to make this case compelling.  He shows us how the Qur'an requires armed struggle (jihad) against infidels (that would be you and me), and that this feature of Islam is not peripheral, nor are they the beliefs of a fringe element.  Killing infidels is a core value of Islam, and required by the Qur'an.  The author shows us, in text boxes, the contrast between the teachings of Jesus (love, peace, respect) and Muhammad (hate, threats, lust).  He shows how the Crusades were fundamentally defensive, and far from being a failure, may well have turned the tide in the Islamic conquest of Europe.  Spencer shatters the \\"moral equivalence\\" approach to Islam, showing that it is incapable of tolerance and that it is dedicated to evangelism by the sword.  The crux of the politically incorrect argument is that it is Islam itself which is a problem for us.  Any honest Muslim has to admit that global jihadist voilence is integral to his religion.  The core motivation for Islamic violence is rooted in the Qur'an, and there is nothing that Islamic apologists can do to obscure that fact.  And this war, dear reader, is just starting to heat up.  The attack on the World Trade Center constituted Islam's declaration of war against the West and its values, and we have no choice but to mold our foreign policy around the defeat of this enemy.<br /><br />Spencer makes \\"a few modest proposals to this end.\\"  First, \\"tie foreign aid to the treatment of non-Muslims.\\"  This means governments must end all support, material, educational, and religious, for jihad warfare, and grant full equality of rights to any non-Muslim citizens.\\"  Second, we must \\"reconfigure our global alliances on the same basis.\\"  Friendly relations with the United States [must] absolutely depend in an immediate and comprehensive renunciation of the jihad, including a reformation of schools that teach it.\\"  Third, \\"call on Muslim states to renounce sharia's expansionist imperative.\\"  Fourth, \\"undertake a full-scale \\"Manhattan Project\\" to find new energy sources, \\"so that the needed reconfiguration of our alliances can be more than just words.\\"  And, at a minimum, how about classifying Muslim groups in the US as being \\"political\\" instead of \\"religious\\" unless they renounce, in word and in deed, any intention to replace the Constitution of the United States with Islamic sharia?  This is not \\"Islamophobia,\\" friends, this is knowing the enemy.s with the United States [must] absolutely depend in an immediate and comprehensive renunciation of the jihad, including a reformation of schools that teach it.\\"  Third, \\"call on Muslim states to renounce sharia's expansionist imperative.\\"  Fourth, \\"undertake a full-scale \\"Manhattan Project\\" to find new energy sources, \\"so that the needed reconfiguration of our alliances can be more than just words.\\"  And, at a minimum, how about classifying Muslim groups in the US as being \\"political\\" instead of \\"religious\\" unless they renounce, in word and in deed, any intention to replace the Constitution of the United States with Islamic sharia?

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Given that most people reviewing this movie, or rather OVA, are 1. already Final Fantasy fans, 2. watched the film before it was released in the U.S. and 3. probably wouldn't make negative comments about something they've pre-ordered months before it ever hits the retail shelves, objectivity is not very likely. However, a movie is a movie, and to be considered a great success, should greatly impress the viewer.  <br />This is no \\"Spirits Within!\\" Digital animation has come a long way in the past few years and \\"Advent Children\\" is a beautiful showcase for it, it is easy to suspend disbelief and be pulled into a film when everything looks so real - and there's no jarring \\"real\\" people or things to interrupt the experience. The animation alone makes this movie worth seeing by anyone who appreciates digital art.  <br />Viewers unfamiliar with Final Fantasy 7, the video game upon which \\"Advent Children\\" is based, be warned: there are people, scenes and conversations that will completely pass under your radar as significant. This is probably the major flaw in this film, because to fully appreciate the story line you really need to have a solid knowledge of the characters, their individual histories as well as the events that lead up to \\"Advent Children,\\" otherwise much of it may seem silly, melodramatic and ill-conceived. Viewers unfamiliar with Final Fantasy 7 should, therefore, keep it in the forefront of their minds that this movie is based upon a video game whose storyline takes more than 60 hours to tell and is considered by many the finest role playing experience ever created (my opinion isn't important, so I'm not going to share it). So does \\"Advent Children\\" only achieve 4-star status if its potentially confusing and vague storyline is excused? No, not really. The more times you watch the movie, the more things make sense because you are seeing and hearing things you may have missed the first time through.  <br />I personally watched this movie six times over thecourse of about 36 hours and was never bored. If moments arise when there's not enough to keep your mind busy, it's almost a given that your eyes will more than make up for it by feasting upon lifelike, expressive faces, detailed landscapes and incredible action sequences. It is the rare film I watch that leaves me with a feeling of stunned awe. This is one of those.
0679422714|5.0|Why is this book getting such high negatives? It is not controversial because of the loud tone in which it was written. Indeed it is written in a very Chinese way by a very Chinese author for a popular Chinese audience. Since her prose is more Kitty Kelley than Bob Woodward however, it is justifiably subject to the shallow critique that it is too personal. The three real reasons why this book has so quickly touched off a negative response are: 1) it touches upon Chinese national myth; 2) it touches some coming of age myths of many Western intellectuals of the baby-boomer generation; and 3) its vast array of new primary sources are unimpeachable.<br /><br />1) This book touches upon PRC national myth, and here I mean myth in the way an anthropologist would. Myth is a sort of marketing exaggeration of historical figures to create a broad meta-narrative for a community to share a common identity. Upon Mao's death, Deng Xiaoping turned China around 180º both in terms of policy and ideology, but political realist that he was, Deng not only maintained the Mao myth, he enhanced it. The Mao myth is that he was a selfless, fearless, workaholic, poet-intellectual whose dreamy romantic notions sometimes made a few mistakes, but by and large were brilliant applications of Marxist thought for the post-colonial world that set a backward, feudal Chinese society on the right path toward today's rapid modernization. The same public Khrushchev line about Stalin is still in vogue in today's China about Mao that \\"he was 70% correct and 30% incorrect.\\" When adult Chinese recite this school-yard quip today they are not talking about his economic policies. When Mao announced in 1949 that the \\"people of China have stood up\\" they mean stood up to foreign intervention of their sovereignty. They know the starvation numbers of The Great Leap Forward are low balled; they know that metrological records of the time show ideal weather for bumper crops; they know about the mutilation and the cannibalism of the cultural revolution; they know the literacy numbers of the 1970s are exaggerated because many in that generation of students that killed their teachers stopped learning to read. But for the Great Leap Forward, Mao is just seen as a Herbert Hoover; for the Cultural Revolution Mao is seen as General Sherman going to excesses for civil war victory. All of this is because Mao is first and foremost seen as a GEORGE WASHINGTON figure: a founding father of national independence. Since George Washington certainly didn't cut down that cherry tree, perhaps we can cut the current government of China some slack - or maybe not. Washington resigned power as a healthy man and went back to his farm. Mao wanted to be the next Joseph Stalin after Stalin died and Khrushchev was denouncing Stalinism. Like Stalin, Mao held on to power until the last blood clot.<br /><br />2) Mao's Red Guards inspired student radicalism from the Students for a Democratic Society in the US to the Red Brigade in West Germany as the Western baby boomer generation was coming of age. Now that they have grown up and vote for social democrats, they like to dream of their young idealism in comparison to the neo-liberalism of the new-left that they see as bought off by corporate America and globalization. They long for a day when there were people who got in the streets and shouted for something - however utopian. The Mao Myth matters to them as well.<br /><br />3) Chang has been able to interview many surviving relatives of the major party figures who were purged as well as locals of various battlefields to get eyewitness history. She was able to do this during a more liberal Zhang Zemin era. I doubt she could get the same access today under Hu Jintao. However, that is not where most of her bombshell conclusions originate. It was Jon Halliday's Russian language skills and systematic access to both Russian and many other Eastern European archives that has provided them with brand new primary sources. Serious historians can no longer brush aside 70 million peacetime deaths as unintended. Soviet archives document Mao's intentionality in 1958-61 mass starvation. THE BIGGEST MORSEL OF NEW HISTORY HERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION OF BOUNTIFUL AGRUCULTURAL SURPLUSS DURING THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD THAT WAS EXPORTED TO THE SOVIET UNION IN EXCHANGE FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BALISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE TECHNOLOGY. And about that George Washington analogy from fighting a war of independence for China, Soviet archives document Mao did the opposite. The Soviets were frustrated with Mao's FAILURE to fight the Japanese (who also threatened the Soviet Union's east) so Stalin ordered him to unite with the Nationalists to FORCE a RELUCTANT Mao to fight. After 1949 China did not stand up from imperialism. Mao became a willing instrument in Soviet colonization of China, giving Stalin Manchuria and Xingjian provinces and obeying Soviet orders on Chinese internal affairs. In the Mao myth there is a breaking with the Soviets that gets painted in a sort of declaration of independence image, but the break with the Soviets was because Mao rejected Khrushchev as a liberal revisionist and wanted to continue to out-Stalin Joseph Stalin as the new leader of international Communism. The Cultural Revolution was instigated once Mao had Lin Bao in total control the PLA so that once anarchy was initiated against Mao's opponents THE ARMY WOULD DO NOTHING and Khrushchev's contacts in the CCP politburo like Liu Shaoqi could be killed at will. Soviet Documents create a very different historical Mao to the Mao of patriotic faith, yet even this account will pale in comparison to the day when the Chinese archives will be open to the public.<br /><br />Mao was right about Deng Xiaoping all along. He was a \\"Capitalist Roader.\\" Deng set in motion China's emergence from poverty yet publicly attributed his success to Mao. Unlike Mao, it was Deng who built new China. Unlike Mao, Deng tried repeatedly to withdraw from power (only to be recalled again and again by repeated successor problems that plague most undemocratic polities). One day, when China's GDP can afford a chattering class that questions national myths, the Mao myth will fade away, and Deng Xiaoping will become the real founding father of modern China.sources.

B000002UA7|5.0|Kate Bush released \\"The Whole Story\\" in November 1986, eight years after her debut album \\"The Kick Inside\\" became a massive chart success in the United Kingdom. This album is Kate's only 'best of' to date, and will most likely remain that way for some time. It contains twelve songs, all of which feature on Kate's first five studio albums: \\"The Kick Inside,\\" \\"Lionheart,\\" \\"Never For Ever,\\" \\"The Dreaming\\" and \\"Hounds Of Love.\\" Most were big hits, a few less so, but what we can get from this collection is a very brief retrospective on the first half of Kate's career, one of the most revered and impressive in all rock and pop history. Because of this, it is an essential album for anyone remotely interested in Kate's music and as a result went straight to No.1 in the UK selling more than 1 million copies to date. The year was 1986, as previously stated, and interest in Kate's music was at an all-time high after her phenomenal comeback the previous year with the now-classic Hounds Of Love, so I think the timing was perfect for this album.<br /><br />The album opens with Kate's most famous single, \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" The song became a massive UK No.1 single in February 1978, just a month after its release. It stayed on top for four weeks and to this day is still considered one of the best songs ever written. This version is the New Vocal version, which is good but I definitely prefer the original over this. \\"Cloudbursting\\" is one of my favourite Kate songs, and one of the highlights from the Hounds Of Love album. The song has an incredible marching rhythm to it and features some stunning lyrics. It was also quite rare to hear string sections in music in this era, so Kate was producing something completely original and out there at the time, a style which has no doubt been copied endlessly in the 20 years since. The song peaked at No.20 in October 1985. \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" was Kate's second single to ever be released, and was a stunning follow up to her debut single. The song peaked at No.6 in the UK in June 1978 and is just a very moving ballad. It's quite short and doesn't even reach the third minute mark, yet the words are so profound and moving that you can't help but be drawn into this classic. Kate was merely 20 years old when this song was released, and to hear such wise words from a young mind was quite refreshing in a music world filled with one-hit wonder disco acts.<br /><br />\\"Breathing\\" is a very brilliant song, but I wouldn't really class it as one of my favourites by Kate. However, this doesn't mean it's a bad song - it's actually one of her finest in terms of production and subject matter. It peaked at No.16 in the UK in April 1980 and is about a nuclear holocaust from the perspective of a baby/foetus, who is breathing in the damaging toxic gases via her mother. The commentary around the third minute is chilling and desolate, a stark warning to the damage of the environment. \\"Wow\\" is a glittering and sparkling pure pop song that peaked at No.14 in the UK in March 1979. As far as lyrical content goes, it's not her best but the sheer power of the chorus is mesmerising. The build up to it is also pretty epic, and Kate's voice never sounded more majestic. This is an anthem for Kate's gay fanbase no doubt, and was the only major hit from her second album. \\"Hounds Of Love\\" was released in February 1986 and charted at No.18 in the UK. It was the third single from the album of the same name, and still ranks as one of Kate's finest ever singles. The belting drum beat still sounds fresh today and the mimicking of hounds barking is pure craziness: the best way to enjoy Kate. Surrender your stereotypes and pre-conceived notions and just succumb to Kate's unadulterated insanity.<br /><br />\\"Running Up That Hill\\" was the song that catapulted Kate back into the limelight and is probably her second most famous song to date. The song climbed to No.3 in the UK charts back in August 1985 and was hailed by NME magazine asthe best song ever created by a non-black British artist. Pretty impressive, don't you think? The song is totally deserving of this accolade, and many a time I find myself wondering if this is - really - my favourite song of all time. The dream-like rhythm to this song swirls around my mind like a beautiful mirage as the relentless drum beat gallops along. Beautiful vocal arrangements, eerie production and lush percussion make this song an undeniable pop classic. \\"Army Dreamers\\" is one of Kate's lesser-known songs and peaked at No.16 in the UK back in October 1980. It was the third and final single from Kate's third album, which had stormed straight to No.1 a month earlier. The song is short and sweet, quite wistful and delicate. This is contrasted by the dark subject matter of a soldier in the army who died at such a young age, and for what? This is Kate's message, it's very anti-war, and for all the right reasons. \\"Sat In Your Lap\\" was the first single to be taken from Kate's fourth album. The song itself is a frenetic three minute journey into the crazy psyche of a woman who wants to be all-knowing and knowledgeable, yet is stopped by the fact that she cannot be bothered investing the time or patience. The song perhaps sends out a message about Kate herself, who spent countless months re-working her albums until they were perfect, which became evident with her fourth album. The song charted at No.11 back in July 1981 in the UK.<br /><br />\\"Experiment IV\\" is the only song on this album not to feature on any of Kate's first five studio albums because it was a brand new song, written especially for this collection. The song peaked at No.23 in the UK in October 1986. Kate had two singles in the Top 40 at this point - the other was her stunning duet with Peter Gabriel on the ballad \\"Don't Give Up.\\" This new song is really good, and has a great percussive beat. However, it's not as good as most of the other stuff here. \\"The Dreaming\\" was released in July 1982 and peaked at a dismal No.48 in the UK a month later. I find this quite strange as apart from being a brilliant song, it was the second and final song to come off the album of the same name. The other (Sat In Your Lap) came out more than a whole year before this song. Record companies wouldn't do that nowadays! The song features Rolf Harris on digaredoo and tells the story of the aboriginal tribe in Australia, constantly at war with the civilised (modern man). The last song on this collection is \\"Babooshka,\\" one of Kate's most famous and popular songs. It peaked at No.5 in the UK back in July 1980. People less familiar with Kate's career would probably see it as a novelty track, yet it's so much more: in it, Kate disguises herself as a mystery admirer and sends love letters to her husband to test his fidelity, to see if he will respond to this 'new woman' who is so taken with him. Very crafty, the lyrics work a treat and you can't help but smile.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />When all's said and done, Kate Bush is one of the most fantastic and out-there artists to ever grace the world of music. The fact that practically no one in America knows who she is tells you something about the current state of the music industry over there, and I feel a great shame that she's not more popular. However, part of Kate's charm and appeal has always been her mystery, and after almost 30 years she is still very elusive. Unlike Madonna, Mariah and Kylie and all the other chart divas who rely on record sales to justify their success, Kate Bush is entirely her own creation. She makes music when she wants to and exactly how she wants to. Very few musicians have this privilege, so with Kate you can always be sure that what you're hearing is 100% what she wants you to hear. I hope another collection like this will follow sometime in the near future, capturing the best singles from the albums that followed this collection, \\"The Sensual World,\\" \\"The Red Shoes\\" and \\"Aerial.\\"ine as the best song ever created by a non-black British artist.

B000002BMV|5.0|This album will always hold a special place in my heart as it was one of the very first albums that I possessed all those years back.  This together with Foreigner's \\"4\\" was the reason why I decided to pick up the guitar and to learn to love and adopt music as a hobby.  I basically wanted to sound like Neil Schon and Mick Jones for years after.  When my cassettes wore out and I decided to get cds, these 2 where among the very first albums that I got replaced.  Now, this album comes remastered for a better, cleaned up sound.  The best tracks here are \\"Don't Stop Believing\\", \\"Who's Crying Now\\", \\"Stone in Love\\", \\"Still They Ride\\" and \\"Open Arms.\\"  That's half the album already and the other tracks are decent as well except perhaps for the 2 weakest tracks, \\"Dead or Alive\\" and \\"Lay it Down.\\"  The Journey sound is a thing of beauty; the Steve Perry vocals and Neil Schon guitar sound are so unique that you just know you're listening to a Journey tune after the first few measures.  It was only when I started learning the guitar that I truly appreciated just how great a guitarist Neil Schon was.  His high speed, great technique modal scalar work is still awesome to behold after all these years.  One of the greatest albums of the 80s and very highly recommended.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|This is probably the worst album I've heard in my Life!!!!<br /><br />What a waste!!!!! Many years ago KORN defined a genre (Nu Metal).<br /><br />With this release they defined another one,..... NU CRAP!!!!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|Someone should explain to the rest of us who appreciate great quality music such as Ratt,Guns n Roses etc.Why lack of talent seems to be mistaken as musical genious?Kurt Cobain was nothing more than a degenerate heroin addict who didn't even know 3 chords on guitar and certainly could not sing.This a perfect example of people buying garbage because they are too stupid to make up thier own minds ans MTV shoved this crap down everyone's throat because it was seen as being trendy.The ONE AND ONLY REASON this genre of music caught on was because every misfit who ever wanted to be in a band but didn't have the talent to play melodic metal and other kinds of music where you have to be able to sing and play saw that you could be a talentless loser like Cobain and get a reaction!This album and this music does not have a single redeeming quality I have never understood why people got into this crap there are no guitar solos(for those of you who listen to this stuff that is something played by talented musicians like Warren Dimartini and Geoerge Lynch),no hooks or melody to the songs and the vocals are absolutley terrible.For god sake don't buy this or anything like it,instead help all of us real rockers who like having a good time support hair metal!The only tragedy to Kurt Cobains death is that it didn't occur a few years earlier. By the way I gave this one star because Amazon said I had to rate it with at least a 1.If it was up to me I wouldn't rate it as high as a pile of petrified dog sh#t.
6305252572|4.0|The movie doesn't really begin until Nolte gets Murphy out of the slammer. As he's walking towards his cell Murphy is singing away to the tunes of \\"Roxanne\\". You can't help but smile. The whole movie is full of great one liners delivered by both Nolte and Murphy. I was surprised to see a very young and buff James Remar as the bad boy. At times it does have a Beverly Hills cop feel to it but darker. After all these years it still makes for good entertainment.

The plot centers around four boys that are sent to the Wilkenson Home for  <br />Boys after a prank in Hell's Kitchen goes horribly wrong. But the guards there are perverts that abuse them, in so many ways.  <br />This ruins their entire lives. But when they have a chance for revenge latter on in life, they take it and a court room trial comes next to determine their fates.  <br />The movie is gripping, powerful and haunting. What makes it even more scary is that its' based on a book written by one of the 4 boys, based on reality.  <br />The acting is great with Robert DeNiro stealing the show! Kevin Bacon is creepy and Dustin Hoffman adds a lot! <br />Ultimately, this movie is one of my favorites of all time. The DVD treatment is lousy though. There are 2 side to the DVD that splits the movie in 2! What the heck? <br />But you can get it for a low price and you'll really enjoy it even though it's so hard to watch. It makes your mind think a lot...and makes you wonder what you would do in their position. Would you kill for revenge? It's so hard to think about these thinks and the fact that it's based on a true story makes it all the scarier.  <br />Sleepers is a masterpiece, a must see movie that will haunt you for days.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ghost Reveries, opeth's latest is plainly their best work yet.  it effectively goes from mean driving dark metal to calm instrumentals without missing a beat.  The band seems to have really grown collectively, and individually.  The mellotron is really cool too.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This cd was released 10 mo. ago and I love it more after listening to it all these months.  What more could you ask for, timeless songs sung by a voice that has that timeless quality, one that doesn't get old.  Go Michael!  I can't wait for the next one and the next one.<br /><br />  Every song here is wonderful, but a couple stand out for me.  \\"Home\\" is not an old song, in fact it is very new, but it has the same quality as the old standards.  \\"Song for You\\" with Chris Botti, gives me chills when I hear it, it is so good!  And, the last song on the cd, \\"You & I\\" is also a favorite.<br /><br />  If you haven't heard this cd, you are missing out on great music and a wonderful voice.  I recommend it.
034547581X|4.0|I would make this required reading for all potential leaders. Moore is not anti-war, but not pro-war, either; he recognizes it needs to happen, but he wants us to see it in detail. The first two thirds of this book are factual descriptions of the battles at Ia Drang in 1965, intelligently using monologues by those involved for paragraphs and even pages at a time. It is the battle through the words of those who were there, and in its detail and portrayal of context it is not only highly accurate but charged with a vivid sense of what the experience must have been like. After this, the authors speak on the political context of the battle, and then follow the families of American dead afterwards. To read that chapter takes a bit of determination. Gen Westmoreland gets lampooned and Chinese intervention get mentioned in the wrap-up after that, which is as tightly written as the rest, and includes criticism of American political methods and aims in the war. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history.
B00005JOFO|2.0|As far as I'm concern, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is over-rated. Yeah, the acting, direction and cinematography were top-notch, but the writing left a lot to be desired. For a 2 1/2 film that spans over 20 years, you'd expect some character development. Unfortunately, I didn't see much. What I did see was a tortured soul (aka Ennis Del Mar) and an optimistic soul (aka Jack Twist) from beginning to end. Nothing much happens in between. <br /> <br />I do not understand why \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is receiving all this acclaim and praise? A far better film was \\"Far From Heaven.\\" Why wasn't that up for 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture? As far as I'm concerned, the Academy Awards is bogus. <br />
B00005JOHI|5.0|Let's say up front that the 2005 Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley as Lizzie and Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy, is not meant to be a 100% accurate adaptation of the book. Trimmed down to a mere 2 hours, the story had to be cut up a great deal. It's also set in the late 1700s - when a 21 year old Jane Austen first thought up the story, instead of the early 1800s, when 38 year old Jane finally finished and published the work.<br /><br />That all being said, this movie is amazingly well done. In some ways, it's much more realistic than other depictions of the story. Many movie versions of P&P have the characters set up almost like cartoon characters. They are squeaky clean, their world is pristine, and they float through it. While many in the early 1800s had nice manners, their life was certainly not Lysol-clean!<br /><br />It was really nice, then, to see the quiet English town actually appear like a live, working English town. The story clearly has Lizzie show up with a ton of mud on her skirts after hiking across miles of marshy English countryside. In most movie versions, that means there's a hint of brown on her trimly pressed outfit. In this version, it's much more realistic. I've hiked around England - you get muddy!<br /><br />In some ways, the movie is like \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\\" - where you hear snippets of dialogue and if you know the story, you realize what is going on in the background. It really does cater strongly to people who know the full story well and don't need all the details filled in. Again, this is to be expected given there are only 2 hours of story here. Many of the backgrounds and details are shaved or missing. The characters, however, are still quite solid and fully done.<br /><br />Lizzie and Darcy of course are the main characters here, and they shine with a freshness that is really great. These aren't \\"story members\\" just walking through and trading barbs. You really get a sense that Lizzie is a flesh and blood woman who is feeling the powerful loves, hates, and other emotions. Darcy feels the same passions, reigning them in under his family training. Many of the scenes with the two characters are just amazing - when they are dancing, when they are in the gazebo in the rain.<br /><br />In some ways, I even feel the movie adds to the story, helping to elucidate scenes that might otherwise go over viewers' heads. Often, Charlotte's choosing to marry Collins is seen as a quiet, calm decision made without any emotion at all. I always found this depiction to be unrealistic. In this version, Charlotte makes it clear that this wouldn't be her ideal choice - but what else can she do? Does she really want to be a spinster and burden on her family? She's full of angst, but she's done the best she could with a bad situation.<br /><br />Also, it's always bugged me that in some movie versions, they made a big deal about Lizzie's \\"revelation\\" in Darcy's home that she really would have been happy as his wife. She feels this way because his servants love him so much, a sign of a truly \\"gentle man\\". However, some movies turn it into a gold-digging Lizzie looking around saying \\"Wow, I could have lived HERE\\". I was very happy that in this movie, Lizzie is touched by the gorgeous sculpture and the way Darcy's sister loves him.<br /><br />Even some of the minor characters are done amazingly well. I love Sutherland and Dench, they are simply wonderful. Others are less stellar - Wickham springs to mind as being an \\"elf lookalike\\" - but it's hard to expect every single cast member to be stunning.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a must-see for anyone who loves a romantic story full of incredibly fun dialogue.woman who is feeling the powerful loves, hates, and other emotions.

B00005MM01|5.0|There is a special place in my heart for this album and for all those who love it too.  It's a kind of high-water mark in my life, evoking a time when the world seemed fresh and clean, and full of sweet magic. <br /> <br />Listening to these recordings once again, with more adult, \\"sophisticated\\" ears, I am surprised to discover, once again, the excellent artistry they demonstrate.  Every note sung just so, as it simply had to be.  A well-polished gem.
B00005JLPK|2.0|At the risk of appearing \\"artistically uncouth,\\" I must admit (in hushed tones) that I did not find Frida interesting enough to even see it through to the end.  Urged by several acquaintances to experience this movie not only on the merit of its emotionally stirring story but for its visual effects as well, I was eager to give it a try.  I did feel drawn in at the beginning of the movie as Frida struggled through a harrowing recuperation from her injuries in a bus accident and discovered her talents in art in the process.  But not long after she began to get serious about art as a career and met up with Rivera, I began to feel that I was merely an observer to an endless parade of the artist's questionable personal actions, provided with little or no understanding as to the underlying reasons for those actions.  I think it was this lack of depth that caused my interest to wane.  The fact that there is little character development or even character understanding in Frida is not surprising since this is often the case with real-life stories.  But it does not make for a satisfying movie experience if this is what you enjoy.  As for the visual effects - supposedly a treat for the senses - I didn't find them particularly noteworthy.  If you're interested in a glimpse into Frida Kahlo's life story as an artist that you admire, then you probably won't be disappointed because the movie brings her story to life, but if you are looking for some level of emotional intimacy with the main character, you may very well be.
0553213105|5.0|For those who are able to set aside their modern-day literature expectations and experiences, reading Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful, even riveting experience. I admit that if I had been assigned this novel in high school or college, reading it would have been an ordeal and I would have cursed the teacher or professor all the way through. Maybe it's my relatively advanced age or the fact that I just saw the movie that caused my mind to open and made Pride and Prejudice difficult to put down and exhilarating to read. Besides the seemingly stilted language of the period, Austen leaves much, including emotions and dialogue, to the imagination. The former lessens more and more as the pages go by and the latter actually makes the story more sensual and exciting. I found myself rereading chapters for the sheer enjoyment of trying to get in the minds of Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Collins and all the others. The characters are unforgetable and I will revisit them from time to time during the rest of my life. Today Pride and Prejudice definitely makes my top ten list of novels to take to a desert island.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Mona Lisa Smile is more about the mores of the east coast elite than art history as its name might imply.  As with many real life situations, conclusions are not drawn with crystal clarity, tending to make the viewer feel a lack of  closure.  And all of the characters do not necessarily grow as a result of their experiences; instead, they merely become aware of their own limitations.  Julia Roberts succeeds in playing the multidimensional role of the art history instructor by occasionally allowing the viewer to see the nonconforming liberal underneath the quiet and reserved historian.  The supporting actresses who play the roles of the students shine in their performances with the exception of Julia Stiles who just can't seem to sound natural in her elocution-smooth accent.  The faithful recreation of  the 1950s culture of this elite group, including fashions, home d&eacute;cor, TV programs, dances, and traditional activities of the college keep the viewer interested, as does a dynamic plot.  The main value in Mona Lisa Smile lies in the understanding of a generation of women who were taught to believe that marriage and housewifery was the only meaningful option for women of their class and that it was guaranteed to provide fulfillment.

0452282152|5.0|In Girl with a Pearl Earring, Chevalier paints such an intimate and believable portrait of a girl whose fascination with and devotion to her \\"master\\" is so complete, that the reader cannot help but admire her and yet pity her at the same time.  Told in a simple yet powerful narrative, Chevalier traces Griet's growing attraction for the painter as well as the complex relationships within the entire Vermeer household and her own.  Each character sketch is a work of art:  the wife whose insecurity makes her self-centered and shallow, the perceptive yet hard-boiled mother-in-law who makes it her business to do what it takes to ensure their financial security, the simple-minded maid who takes offense easily and doesn't hesitate to punish those who offend her, the brother who is so disillusioned with his apprenticeship that he becomes reckless in the pursuit of pleasure, and the artist, who is willing to sacrifice a young girl's honor and livelihood as well as his own relationship with her, to become a successful painter.  Chevalier helps us to understand the private life of an exceedingly bright and sensitive but very quiet young girl who is surprisingly astute in her evaluations of the people she comes in contact with but yet naïve where her strongest affections lie.  Chevalier skillfully traces Griet's growing attraction for her \\"master\\" that develops into a bond she cannot willingly relinquish even when it threatens to destroy her chances for future happiness.  She also addresses the moralistic attitudes of the times that left young women of Griet's station in life with few choices if they were unlucky enough to attract the attentions of the wrong sort of man.  In addition to the complex personal relationships that Chevalier brings to life, she succeeds in creating a convincing portrayal of daily life in 17th-century Holland as well as the process of painting from the preparation of the paints to the finishing touches, through rich and sensual visual imagery. Overall, Girl with a Pearl Earring is an absorbing and evocative novel that is sure to give the reader a deeper understanding of the bond that can develop between two people who share a similar way of looking at the world as well as an insight into the emotions felt by those who lack the freedom or the desire to reveal them.Girl with a Pearl Earring is an absorbing and evocative novel that is sure to give the reader a deeper understanding of the bond that can develop between two people who share a similar way of looking at the world as well as an insight into the emotions felt by those who lack the freedom or the desire to reveal them.
B000002OX7|5.0|I've read some other reviews for this album.  Many of them have a sense of unpleasantness that leaves you feeling like this is a bad album.  Actually, this is a very, very good album.  Pete Townshend is a brilliant songwriter, and this album highlights some of the best material he's ever come up with.  He manages to capture the emotional teenage mind in a rock and roll atmosphere.  \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are pure classics.  I also enjoyed \\"Love Ain't for Keeping\\" and \\"Bargain.\\"  For any fan of The Who or classic rock, this album is a must.
B000BYY0RY|4.0|Kylie Minogue continues to become an endearing and talented live performer, which was clear in previous DVD releases such as Live in Sydney (2001) and Live in Manchester (2002).  This release opts more for the camp spectacle of the Sydney tour than the stylish elegance of the futuristic Manchester performance, so your enjoyment of this DVD may depend on how much you enjoy the campy side of Kylie.   <br /> <br />Certainly no expense has been spared for this concert; in fact, this is probably Kylie's most elaborate - and expensive - show ever.  It has many enjoyable moments, including \\"Giving You Up\\"; the energetic \\"Smiley-Kylie\\" medley; the beautifully choreographed \\"In Denial\\" sequence; a sexy \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" performance; and a faithful version of \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" which adheres to its original Europop version.   <br /> <br />Kylie's in great voice, and commands the stage well, although there is a touch of sadness watching the show knowing that Kylie would shortly be diagnosed with breast cancer.  <br /> <br />This DVD will undoubtedly please Kylie fans looking for an upbeat, high-energy show. If you haven't paid much attention to Kylie, this is a good start since she covers every phase of her career.

B000696PWC|3.0|Kylie Minogue shows, although she is not as big as Madonna, she has been in the music bussines for many years and that her music has changed over the years. After quiting Newbours she started her music career with singles such as 'The locomotion(1989)' and 'I should be so lucky(1988)'. These songs sound pretty out of date and fans will love songs like these, but many people who bought the album hoping to hear more like 'Can't get you out of my head(2002)', 'Chocolate(2004)' or 'I believe in you(2005)' will be dissointed by this release. The album really shows the way she changed over the years though and if you are looking for a nice overview of her music career, you will happy with this release cause you might have just found what were looking for.
B000002VQQ|4.0|In the 1970's I owned two of Patti Smith's vinyl releases, 'Wave', and this disc, her debut LP, released in 1975.  Though artist's such as Smith were part-punk, part-post psychedelia, the heir's apparent to hippie-inspired rock and roll, they still maintained a direct connection to the Baby Boom Generation, as evidenced by the non-Patti Smith compositions chosen for this disc, Van Morrison's 'Gloria', Chris Kenner's 'Land of a Thousand Dances' (previously recorded by Wilson Pickett), and on the remastered CD, Pete Townshend's 'My Generation'.  Of course Patti Smith's versions, though possessing all the intensity and passion of the original versions (and then some), also lack the relative innocence of those renditions.  In part, Smith's interpretations serve notice that that crown of rock's royalty has been passed to a new genre, if not a new generation.  That new generation, perhaps more of an addendum to the Baby Boom Generation, included a greater openness to alternative lifestyles, as Smith sings love songs to 'Gloria' and 'Kimberly' in her uncompromising manner.    I originally purchased 'Horses' due to a dearth of quality recordings being produced by my old standby's, such as Eric Clapton, Stephen Stills, Neil Young and Steve Winwood.  At the time, Smith's version of 'Gloria' was receiving considerable FM airplay, and she seemed to be on the cusp of something new and exciting.  While I wasn't enthused by the recording as a whole, it certainly was loud, raw, explicit, and challenging, qualities my previous favorites had apparently forsaken.  Smith's singing style was also completely unique, and despite the fact her lyrics were at times incomprehensible, it was always a treat to hear her deliver them.  I'm much more enthused by Smith numbers that possess a fast tempo and hungry, driving guitar work, such as the opening track, 'Gloria', promised for the rest of the disc.  Unfortunately you have to work through the punk-reggae of 'Redondo Beach', and the punk-bluesof 'Birdland' to get to the more serious pile driving excursions of 'Free Money', 'Kimberly', and 'Break It Up'.  These three tracks, in addition to 'Gloria', are to me the meat of the album.  Although the slower numbers are outnumbered on the disc, since 'Birdland' and 'Land' time out at about nineteen minutes, they claim much of the available recording time.  The original closer, 'Elegie', is also a slow track, timing out at 2:41.  Smith added a bonus track, an unremarkable 3:16 live version of 'My Generation' to this remastered package.    Patti Smith appeals to a more artistically aware and elite crowd than rock and roll normally attracts.  She spent time delivering her poetry without musical support prior to 1975, and even on this disc at times reads rather than sings her writings.  Nevertheless, Smith relies on a bare bones backing band of piano, bass, lead guitar, and drums, and the instrumental backing is simplistic as well.  I never found Patti Smith's brand of performing as something I would consistantly listen to, but it did find a niche in my collection, appealing as an alternative rather than a staple.  I guess society as a whole possessed the same view, as only one Patti Smith song, 'Because the Night', ever cracked into the Top-40 (#13 in 1978).  While I considered three stars, four is perhaps more representative of 'Horses' overall value.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|The arrival of \\"King Kong\\", one of the years most anticipated films, gives movie goers a big box office spectacle just in time for the holidays.  A lot of overwhelming expectations ride on this film and its director, especially since it is a remake of a beloved classic that most everyone has seen.  The question is this----Is Peter Jackson successful in remaking this movie?  I think the answer is yes.<br /><br />Although there are some problems with the film, I think overall Jackson did a nice job of bringing this story to the big screen.  Its obvious that this film was a labor of love.  Naomi Watts is perfect as the lovely Ann Darrow, the beauty who steals the heart of the beast.  Jack Black, the film director Carl Denim, adds humor to the story and Adrien Brody provides the human love interest for Ann Darrow.  But the true star of the movie is, of course, Kong.  And Jackson succeeded at humanizing the big ape, making the viewer realize that Kong has been taken out of his element.  Probably for me, the best moments in the film are the moments that Kong spends alone with Ann Darrow.  From the time that she dances for him and he sees her as a small, moving toy to the final scenes where she sees him in the street and the inevitable climb of the Empire State Building---these are the moments that make the movie.  The scenes are tender and, for me, are really the best moments in Jackson's remake.  I especially liked the scene where Kong with Darrow, discovers snow in the park---a nice touch.<br /><br />And for those who like action, there is plenty once their ship, the Venture, runs ashore Skull island.  From T-Rexes, huge long necks dinosaurs, giant insects and evil natives, the adventurors face a gamit of challenges, including Kong himself.  The special effects are good and keep the action flowing.<br /><br />Now for the problems.  To me the first hour is just too long.  I think the introduction of the characters and their storylines seemed to take forever.  My 8 year old nephew actually fell asleep for the first hour but awakened once Kong made his appearance. Also, as much as I enjoyed Skull island, I think the time spent there could have been edited a little.  The film score was okay but I think could have been a little more dramatic.<br /><br />Overall, however, I think this is a film you will enjoy.  Its a great popcorn flick and definitely should be see on the big screen.  Some of the scenes will be too intense for small children but my 8 year old niece and nephew enjoyed the film (the last two hours)---any younger and they may get bored or scared.

B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira wowed us this year with the release of not one but two cds.  Earlier in the year she gave us Fijacion Oral Vol. 1, featuring the top 40 hit song, \\"La Tortura\\".  Now she gives us her English offering, Oral Fixation Vol. 2, with its first single, \\"Don't Bother\\".  Shakira is an interesting artist with a great voice and creative lyrics.  My favorite songs from this set are \\"Don't Bother\\", \\"Animal City\\" and \\"Timor\\".  I really hope that she will release \\"Animal City\\" as a single from this cd.<br /><br />I discovered Shakira with her hit cd, \\"Donde Estan Las Ladrones?\\", which I still consider her best cd.  To me, Shakira is at her best in Spanish, singing more powerfully and passionately.  But I'm glad that English speaking fans are beginning to recognize her talent.  If you haven't given her a listen, also check out \\"Laundry Service\\" and \\"Donde Estan Las Ladrones?\\".  She's definitely a great addition to your cd library.
B00005JNQS|5.0|What a cute movie. My kids love it. I have a 13, 11, and a 3 1/2 yr. old and they all enjoy this movie. I think it is great because I think it was much more tastefully done than some of the other animated movies...many nowdays seem more interested in adult comedy than what is appropriate for children. However, I think that there are several parts/jokes that parents can really relate to (ex. the 12 hours of labor joke). <br />There are a few places where the humor is a little crude but the kids do not really get it and it is not nearly as crude as Shreck. <br /> <br />The only other parts of the movie that may desturb young children is when Ratchet goes to visit his mother, the sweepers, and when Fender looses his bottom half and picks up a \\"woman\\" robot's bottom. My 3 year old wasn't scared by any of these parts but she kept asking me why the \\"Mom\\" was mean and sounded like a boy, why the sweepers kept picking up parts and one of the robots and if they were hurt by it and where they were going, and why the boy robot had on a girl skirt. Some of these things sound a little odd but I think they were ok within the context of the movie. After doing a little explaining she was fine and has even been repeating a few lines from the movie...which she has never done before with any show. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone but I think parents should watch it first and make sure it is appropriate for thier children.
0385512058|2.0|While I was reading the book, I actually convinced myself to go the extra mile and keep open lines of communication with random people (albeit, financially/socially powerful) in my naive enjoyment. However, after I finally made it through (its 250+ pgs), I realized that a lot of the content is bogus and not realistic in a \\"regular\\" lifestyle (unless your dad fed you into Yale and you cruised your way to a Harvard MBA, and then could afford to finally ask yourself what you actually want to do). I do love how some authors pride themselves on their humble upbringing, but yet somehow acsend to Ivy League undergrad & grad school through a favor. Anyways getting back to my point, do not buy the book - I recommend sitting at Barnes, Borders, etc. and reading the first 60-80 pgs (max). If you're looking for some motivation/tactics of networking, you might find it within that portion. The rest 150+ pgs just beats a dead horse. I'm a slow reader and the small amount of time it takes to hit the first 60 pages isn't worth paying for.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Look.  I don't write reviews.  But I'm tired of everyone saying that this album is pretty good, but not as good as the Soft Bulletin, their \\"obvious masterpiece.\\" <br /> <br />I got into the Lips several years back after hearing Transmissions from the Satellite Heart.  A great rock record.  Then onto Clouds Taste Metallic and the Soft Bulletin.   <br />All those albums are great, every single one.  The Soft Bulletin really takes it there, though. <br /> <br />That being said, I was looking forward to giving Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots a try.  And I gotta say, I didn't think much of it.  Cluttered, confusing, it didn't have the hooks of their other albums that drew me in.  After a couple of listens I told someone \\"Well, Yoshimi Part I and Do You Realize are pretty good, but as a whole the album's not really worth getting.\\"   <br /> <br />But there is something to be said for patience.  Like many of the most rewarding things in life, this album needs time to ferment in your brain.  After putting it back on the shelf, a year later I picked it up again.  And again.  And again.  And I have this to say: This is probably my favorite album of all time.  I own somewhere around  500 albums.  I like many genres of music, from rock to country to hip hop to classical to electronic.  And I don't love any album as much I love this one.   <br /> <br />Listen to it a few times.  Take a break.  Then, one night, get high (or not), turn off the lights and lay down and listen to Yoshimi Battle the Pink Robots on the best pair of headphones you can find.  This album is so beautiful, sad, and uplifting.   The production is incredible.  The sound of the bass - what album has better sounding bass?? - plodding the course of many of the tracks cuts through to your brain, rhythmic and melodic simultaneously.  The guitars, the electronics, the drums both synthetic and live banging heavy and aggressive when needed, soft and sparse when not.  What ultimately brings this album to the top is the lyrics.  The power of the song \\"The Gash\\" from the Soft Bulletin is spread across almost every track on Yoshimi.   There are people who criticize this album for having simplistic or cliche'd lyrics.  But the kind of universal truth in lyrics like \\"I'm a man, not a boy/and there are things you can't avoid/you have to face them/when you're not prepared to face them\\" will draw in anyone who is genuinely trying to make a good go of it in this nutty world. <br /> <br />Also, as a musician, there's no album that is as intimidating and inspiring.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|This is a fantastic movie about lies, truth, and obsession.  One character works as a stripper(Portman) and dates an obituary writer(Law). The obituary writer is having a secret liaison with a photographer(Roberts) who is married to a dermatologist.  All the characters are strong.  The dialog is harsh and moving.  It`s a rare movie where all the characters have depth and you find yourself sympathizing with each of them.  See this movie.
6305971153|5.0|This movie is FANTASTIC! It makes us laugh, it makes us cry...... It's the staple Christmas movie in our house. It's not Christmas until you've watched Santa Claus. You will really and truly believe in Santa after watching this movie.
B0009F9O6M|4.0|Years ago (before the Internet) I was looking at a book about my favorite band called \\"Genesis: From One Fan To Another\\" by Armando Gallo. Inside there was a reproduction of was an old Charisma records tour billing from 1972 that included Van der Graaf Generator and Lindisfarne. Trying to determine what kind of environment could have produce the singular style of Genesis, I bought a Van der Graaf compilation CD.    At first, I thought they were a poor man's Genesis. Their keyboardist wasn't in the same league as Tony Banks and who was that horrible singer? But, once I listened to the drummer, my experience changed.    H To He was the first full-length VdGG album I bought. Peter Hammill's dark (and frankly depressing) lyrics are redeemed by the sharp and aggressive attack of drummer Guy Evans and saxophonist David Jackson. Killer is one of the standout cuts and is reminiscent of early King Crimson. With their cutting lyrics and superb musicianship, VdGG are one of those groups that stays with you forever.    [DW]
B000063DS1|5.0|These guys were an incredible group that put out great work for many years.  All that talent was evident in their final concert, \\"The Last Waltz\\".  The 4 disc set is loaded with amazing versions of their songs as well as the songs of many other influential singers/musicians from the 60s/70s.  Well worth your money.  A lot of great music.  Also be sure to check out the Scorcese film.  That was an awesome concert... wish I had been there.
B000001DTM|5.0|\\"Achtung Baby\\" has a special place in my life. At the same time U2 were unveiling their reinvented selves to the world, I had moved to Los Angeles to reinvent myself as a writer. I was driving to the office I worked at, and K-Rock in Los Angeles announced they were about to world-debut the brand new song from the new U2 album. This being morning on the 101, it meant that I was sitting for extended periods of time...and the heady buzz of \\"The Fly\\" came on the speakers.<br /><br />It was a good thing we were in gridlock, because I would have needed to pull over. I was that amazed. Bono had suddenly made the leap from charismatic flag waving anthem belter to charismatic rock god (\\"it's no secret that a conscious can sometimes be a pest...\\"). It was such a stunning transformation that - on the day \\"Achtung Baby\\" was released - I ran out on my lunch break to find a copy. The album thoroughly lived up to and even beyond my expectations. U2 had redefined themselves for the new decade, and had also thrust themselves into a new level of musical awareness.<br /><br />It came with not just the incredible cohesion of this album, but in the stunning songs. \\"Mysterious Ways\\" found the band exploring funk. \\"Zoo Station\\" was the earlier foray into the electronics that would burst out on \\"Zooropa\\" and the ballads were some of Bono's best lyrics yet. It culminates in \\"Achtung Baby's\\" centerpiece, the astonishing \\"One.\\" Correspondingly bitter, aching, resentful and hopeful, it is easily one of the best songs of the 90's. It takes the traditional themes of spiritual wanderlust and frustration and wraps it up in the conciseness of a lyric like:<br /><br />\\"You say love's a temple, love's a higher law.<br /><br />You ask me to enter, then you make me crawl.\\"<br /><br />\\"Achtung Baby\\" was the album that lifted U2 from their already lofty position in rock and set their path for the new decade. In my library, this is a desert island record.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I agree with others that this is one amazing movie. It is magnificent to watch in a theater, especially King Kong. The natives of Skull Island acted and looked terrifying, especially when they killed some of the movie crew. The rest of the actors do their bit extremely well. <br /> <br />This movie is a great example of a movie being perfect because of it's imperfections. A movie that has the heroine stand in her high heels on top of the Empire State Building clearly is not a reality based movie. In real life, she would have been blown off in half a second by the wind. But the effect is real enough that it triggered my fear of heights. I wanted to yell at the woman to get down. Or just jump and end my anxiety. The whole movie is filled with this unreal but real quality. <br /> <br />We brought our kids, 7 and 10. They spent a good deal of the middle third of the movie in the theater hallway. Even I wound up there during the Spider Pit scene. But other kids in the theater didn't seem so grossed out. My wife says she would not have taken the kids had she realized the violence in that part of the film. <br /> <br />That said, this is a highly unusual movie, not something you will see so well done every day. The film is extremely beautiful and moving (as in tender, scary, freaked out, funny). It would be a shame not to see it and especially not to see it in a theater.
B0002VEX7S|5.0|This cd lives in my cd changer. This album is one of my all time favorites and is one of Loreena Mckennit's best, if not her best. Each song on the album is unique and beautiful, each one stands out in it's own way. Songs such as Prolouge and Marco Polo give us a beautiful middle eastern sound, while La Serenissma is a senseous beautiful spanish inspired ballad. The mummers dance gives us a beautiful song celebrating springtime. Skellig brings us to the rocky shores of ireland, and is a beautiful and bittersweet song. Dante's Prayer is a beautiful haunting love song with a gregorian-type chorus join in with her, and lastly The Highwayman sets Alfred Noyes beautiful hauntingly beautiful poem of a highwayman and his love to music just as beautiful. Loreena Mckennit's lyrics are always beautiful, her voice is earthy and senseous. This is a MUST for anyone who likes a diverse and sensous cd selection. Go out and get it!!!
B0002ZMITY|1.0|I like Ali G, but this is so retarded that it is a waste of time.  It makes Half Baked seem sophisticated.  I laughed a few times, however.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This one of my favorite movies of all time. The cast which includes Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, Rob Brown and Anna Panquin is great, and the story is orginal and inspiring. This movie tells the story of an underprivlaged young man named Jamal who is uncommonly good writer in a world where it not wholely appreacited. He meets up with Sean Connery  who plays William Forrester, a reclusive writer who mentors him and in turn Jamal helps him come out of his own shell, Jamal attends a upscale prep school where he comes up some opposition in Professor Robert Crawford(F. Murray Abraham) who is a bitter, unsucsessful writer turned high school English teacher. He thinks Jamal being a black kid from the Bronx can't possibily write as good as he does and accuses him of cheating. There are also apperances by Busta Rhymes and even Matt Damon to give this movie a very diverse and great cast. The cimetography and the diverse sound track is also a great addition to the movie.
0553801503|3.0|The latest book in A Song of Ice and Fire series appears to be a meandering exercise in following side characters which adds little to the progress of the overall story line. I have loved all the other books, re-read them , kept well clear of the spoilers. But having just finished this one, and although George R.R. Martin still writes as well as in his other works (hence the three stars), I feel cheated.   <br /> <br />Nothing much happens in a book of 800 pages: Cersei becomes a main character but she is shallow and obviously self destructive so her progress does not keep me awake at night; Sansa grows up a little, same with Arya; Jon stays where he was in the previous book; Bran has disappeared; Samwel takes a journey in which he meets some colourful characters; and there is no further mention of any of the historical story lines e.g. about Rhaegar, Lyanna, the tournament of Harrenhall. The only characters which were further developed were Jaime, who having lost a hand cannot continue to be the golden ruler of the roost of knights and Brienne, the ugly maid warrior who (somewhat predictably, as the same thing happened to Tyrion) only becomes uglier although her character is developed nicely.  And it all ends in suspense, somewhat like a weekly TV serial, except that it comes in three yearly installments. <br /> <br />I would have much preferred to see the story with the main characters from the first three books continue and progress in this book and (if one can have a wish-list) some of the riddles if not answered then at least further explored. Sure, it is difficult to invent a whole new world so I have no problem at all with using it to generate any number of books. However I believe that George R.R. Martin could produce better work by writing a separate series or one-off books which deal with new characters or further explore the non-primary characters, rather than just adding more detail and more characters and going nowhere. <br /> <br />I would recommend not to buy the book if you can get it from a library or from a friend, for the next one I will try to read it before spending any money.
B00004VWAF|4.0|That may seem harsh but it's the truth. Take the title of the instance; On the Corner. What was \\"on the corner\\" for any major city in 1972? An abstract mix of sounds, but with a common groove, yes? Well there you go. Take his stated influnces for this piece, Sly and Stockhausen, have you listened in depth to those two composers? Groove and the use of sound verse silence. If you have these three pieces; what a corner in 1972 sounds like, Sly and Stockhausen... then you have On the Corner. I'm sorry that somebody in 2005 writes what amounts to \\"getting it\\" for a creation of 1972, but that's life. It's abstract music people, if all you want is someone to put out one album after another that sounds exactly the same then you just don't \\"get it\\". This is not music for people who don't like abstract reality, it clicked for me right away. I don't love it nor hate it, I like it. It will influence me. I'm sorry that Miles isn't around to hear this, but he wouldn't care anyway. I don't feel sorry for people stuck in one groove of music, but you must realize how limited that is. Miles was beyond Jazz, can't you \\"get it\\"? Jazz, like all labels, is a limit. If you don't like it, that's cool. See? I *really* respect Miles now, he's not \\"just\\" a jazz player to me anymore after hearing this several times over. Maybe this is just music for musicians, but that happens. I'm not sure people without exposure to music theory can really grasp what is \\"On the Corner\\".
0446310786|5.0|In this unforgettable story, a woman recounts a part of her childhood in a small Alabama town during the Depression.  Her father, Atticus Finch, was the local lawyer, an upright and wise man, who raised her brother Jem, and herself, Scout.  The summer before Scout started school, their idyllic lives were full of imagination and adventure; their games often concerned their reclusive neighbor \\"Boo\\" Radley, and how best to make him to \\"come out.\\"  Scout began the first grade and found many things confusing, not the least of which was her teacher's admonition not to read any more with her beloved father.  Summer came again, and with it, a controversial trial that would affect the children's lives forever:  A black man was accused of raping a white woman and, despite pressure from racist townsfolk, Atticus was defending him.<br /><br />The straightforward and innocent rural dialogue absolutely deserves to be read aloud to be enjoyed and appreciated.  I often found myself rereading passages again and again, just because they were worded so perfectly.  The children's adventures were very easy to picture in my mind, and the narration had a truth about it that was simple, inspiring and touching.  This tale of childhood innocence teaches lessons about tolerance and kindness, and paints one of the most remarkable characters in literature, the courageous and loving Atticus Finch.  This is a novel to be savored and enjoyed over and over again.  It is wonderful.<br /><br />Kona
B00007L4MJ|5.0|\\"Between the brain that plans and the hands that build there must be a mediator.\\" This famous quote by Thea von Harbou perfectly summarizes the main theme of the film.<br /><br />The story takes place in 2026 in the city of Metropolis, where the society is divided into two groups: the elite ruling class (brain that plans) and the working class (the hands that build). The way the city of Metropolis is represented is expressionistic in the way that the two different layers, the underground and the above ground, reflect the emotions as well as the living conditions of the people living there. In the above ground, the elite class lives a luxurious, happy life; entertain themselves in the \\"eternal gardens,\\" the skyscrapers rising to the sky represent the rising of upper class in wealth and power. Whereas, the workers live in the gloomy labyrinths of the underground, which is the power center of the city; they are stuck in dim buildings that are surrounded by huge machinery. There is no mediator between these two groups until one person from the ruling class dares to go underground; he is terrified with what he sees.<br /><br />The visual features used in the film are highly impressive especially when the technological conditions of the German film industry in the 1920s are considered. The symbolical usage of lights and shadows as well as the music contribute to the plot, and these features artistically enrich the film. The mechanical and cold atmosphere of the city is successfully represented through architecture. The gestures and mimics of the actors in Metropolis is one of the things that you cannot find in Hollywood films. This is absolutely a masterpiece of silent films.<br /><br />Lang's film has many levels; one can approach it politically, in terms of class dynamics or in terms of gender and the representation of woman or its association with the evil, etc. The characters are brilliantly used for conveying the sub-themes in the film. You have to see this multidimensional master piece of science fiction; it is a feast for the eye, for the ear and the mind!

0141301155|5.0|I am twelve years old. This book is very easy for anyone to read, ages 7 and up. This book only took me two days to read.

This is a great book for all ages, though it might be a bit weird if a thirty-eight year old reads this book.
B000000H57|5.0|In honor of winter's presense surrounding me, I'd like to discuss one of my favorite \\"seasonal\\" albums, Type O Negative's October Rust. And by seasonal, I mean it encompasses all seasons--just take the cover art, which by each song pairs photo of the woods in different conditions, different lights. October Rust is the most melodic of Type O's works to date, and as a result, the favorite of many fans. It may be softer than  their other albums, but still retains some aggression and lots of haunting through its ambience, deep guitar bellows, and Pete Steele's bottom-of-the-well bass vocals.<br /><br />Type O Negative has this way of merging sarcasm and beauty. It's just an ever-apparent characteristic of their style. In October Rust, they start out by playing a little gag on us, but before we have too much time to respond, we are immediately thrust into \\"Love You to Death,\\" a song of ultimate gothic romance. The romance continues with \\"Be My Druidness,\\" a tale of pure lust. The sun is alive and burning in \\"Green Man,\\" a song about the human condition through the seasons. Next, if you're dreaming of a black Christmas, you have to experience \\"Red Water.\\" It's  not a song of Christmas morning, but rather Christmas mourning. The mood and the transitions in this song are amazing. \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend,\\" the most catchy tune on the album, is all about kink and unconventional romance. \\"Die With Me,\\" a song about the departure of a loved one, is softer with beautiful crescendos. \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen,\\" though minimal in lyrics, carries some great moments, though one of the weaker tracks. Themes of burning continue into \\"In Praise of Bacchus, where we have wounded images of New York City--a song that intensifies the most at the end. \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" takes the basic melody of the Neil Young version and twists it into something completely Type O. \\"Wolf Moon\\" carries moods of isolation in the deep woods; of the warning and spell-like quality of a full moon shining upon darkness. Tortured sensuality drifts through \\"Haunted,\\" the final and darkest track.tured sensuality drifts through \\"Haunted,\\" the final and darkest track.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Since it's release, Ray of Light has been my favorite Madonna cd.  I always felt like she would never top that one.  Well, I was wrong.  Confessions is now my favorite.  There is not one bad song in the bunch.  It is a continuous, magical, fun trip to the dance floor.  My personal favorite song is 'Sorry', and I am glad that it is the second single to be released.  You just can't go wrong with this cd.  Buy it and dance your heart away!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album (if i've got my story straight - I'm pretty sure this is correct) was written in a kind of emotional white heat right after at least two members of the band had close family members pass away, and right at the top of AF's first rock star stride.  This album is beautiful, lucid and hypnotic; I can feel the emotion woven in with the vocals, to say nothing of arcade fire's seamless, pitch-perfect sonic textures.  It's quite the versatile album, all very well match up with each other.   <br />Excellent ten track set list.
1573301051|3.0|WOW! what a spectacualur performance by all these divas!  Its refreshing to watch a show were you know the people are actually all singing.  What talent they ALL possess!  My favorite of the show was the \\"Natural Woman\\" performance... Celine Dion really blew me away in this one (not that i have ever heard her sing a bad note in my life!) Definatly recommended to anyone who enjoys soaring vocals true talent; excellent show!
B000AP04NI|1.0|Yes well you guessed it.<br /><br />I too think that fox have managed the release of this badly.<br /><br />Fox should outsource any re-release to Warners who know how to manage these things appropriatly.<br /><br />Shame Fox Shame.<br /><br />I'm sure you're reading this fox people.  What action are you taking ?<br /><br />Amazon is a powerful tool and I might suggest that in the future you choose to test market some of your products with the people who are focused on quality.  Or you will continue to receive feedback that has people choose not to buy your products.<br /><br />Something Positive<br /><br />I did however enjoy hearing Ms Jones talk about the experience<br /><br />of filming this wonderful musical.

B000BNI90O|5.0|A fantastic score finally gets the treatment it deserves.  No LOTR fan should be without it.  You can throw away the earlier release of the soundtrack for this one. <br />If you don't buy this one, the other two may never be released!
B00003TL18|5.0|Roy Orbison, KD Lang, Bruce Sprinsteen, Bonnie Rait, Jackson Brown among them. A very cool addition to any music dvd collection.
B00005JNX0|3.0|The one thing great I can say about this movie is that the computer graphics are amazing.  I wish I could say the same about the script.  There are some laughs in spots and there are dead spots.  It tries to be too funny for it's own good and tries too much to be like Shrek.  Some laughs adults will enjoy some lines and some scriptlines will go over Children's heads.  But kids will enjoy this cute film.  Marginal recommendation.
B000000W5P|5.0|Five stars for this album cuz of the great song called Shattered. <br />And don't you know the crime rate is going up up Up Up UPPPPPPP!! <br />Funny, definately you want to repeat that track over n over again <br />. And that is the Stones' greatest song ever came out.
B000957O82|4.0|I didn't have much anticipation for this film and I though this was a routine chick flick.  However, Will Smith shows that he can take any acting role given to him and make it work.  He's become a veteran entertainer.  This film surprised me.  Kevin James (King of Queens) is hilarious as the accountant, trying to win the heart of his boss.  Eva Mendes is a lovely presence on the screen as the gossip columnist who uncovers Hitch's secret.  The story is wonderful, original and doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's a refreshing change of pace and will entertain all who watch.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Last night, I learned how to play Heavy Fuel, and it was great. <br />The sound sounded like heavy metal to me. But today, I got the <br />chorus, the whole song I can do. How amazing that is. I think <br />Knopfler does Heavy Fuel very well and it is one my all time <br />favorite songs. In my opinion worth repeat over and over n over <br />again. Calling Elvis is a very good album opener in my opinion. <br />The Bug is a good song too but better live. My Parties is a great <br />song too, last night I couldn't remember what track that My Parties was on. But then I relized that it was track 10. But <br />great buy along with Love Over Gold. Later, <br /> <br />Heavy Rocking Guitar Solo Kid.
0446605409|4.0|I like DeMille.  I loved NIGHT FALL.  And I liked PLUM ISLAND, tho there may be simply too many of Corey's macho antics-or this may be just another way of saying what others have said, that the novel is a little too long.  But also like others, I enjoy most of the smartass dialogue. <br /> <br />There is good suspense here for the most part, and I thought good characterization.  The main thing I object to is the clichd scene at the climax, where the bad guy has the drop on the good guy and talks to him instead of shooting him-thus of course giving the good guy a chance to reverse the roles (which we knew he was going to do all along).  Problem is, this is a hoary plot device, having been used some eight or nine million times by H'wood.  If the bad guy-supposedly intelligent-wanted to talk to the good guy (he should know better, since the good guy isn't going to tell him anything), he should first incapacitate the good guy by shooting him in the thigh or something like that.   <br /> <br />Other than that, and being about fifty pages too long, I liked it and would recommend it.  In fact, I have three more of DeMille's novels on hand to read. <br /> <br />Side issue--one thing I appreciated about THE PROFESSIONAL (Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman) is that the killer opens the door, doesn't say a word, but shoots three guys in about one second.  No BS.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is a good Beatles collection for some of their good songs <br />like Day Tripper, Hey Jude, Get Back, & Come Together. Never really liked the early Beatles. They were too slow, and old. <br />The White Album had a bit more of hard rock and metal, and that's <br />how I like it. But man, Hey Jude gets old fast with the repeat <br />the nana's, just like Foreigner's I Want to Know What Love Is. <br />Those 2 maybe the most boring songs I have ever heard. Except <br />Hey Jude is even more annoying because it has repeats for 4 minutes. And can't you hear Paul McCartney screaming at the end? <br />Really not fun stuff. I Want to Know What Love Is from Foreigner <br />only has repeats for 2 minutes. Both songs have great opening <br />stuff. Especially Hey Jude opens up beautiful with nice lyrics. <br />Day Tripper is my favorite song out of the 4 I like on this <br />album because of the guitar, that's why. Buy it for those 4. <br />And buy this album with The Beatles (The White Album).
0395389496|5.0|This is a beautiful book that is filled with magic. I loved it from the first time I opened it, years before the movie came out. Each time I read it, the story brings back the feelings of Christmas magic from years ago. It has a wonderful story and beautiful pictures to go along with it.<br /><br />The story is that of a young boy who doesn't think Santa is real because a friend told him so. He waits on Christmas Eve with his heart heavy, wanting desperately to hear Santa's bells. Unfortunately, he doesn't hear them. Instead, he hears a train whistle coming from his front yard, and there his adventure begins.<br /><br />Reading this book to the children has become a wonderful Christmas tradition that I hope will continue for years to come.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best. I just received a 3rd copie 2 days ago <br />from Redwood Middle School. Anyways, best songs on this CD are <br />Holiday, my favorite song of all time. and Whatsername. Holiday <br />makes me laugh when they say, PUNISHMENT, GOVERNMENT, DON'T AGREE <br />or MEANT FOR ME. What does Pulverize the Eiffel Towers mean? <br />Anyways, my other favorite song is Boulevard of Broken Dreams. <br />Are We The Waiting / St Jimmy is a great song too. So is Wake Me <br />Up When September Ends. It rocks hard and you have to buy this <br />with my available albums, Guns N' Roses greatest hits. <br />Buy it now.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I keep reading reviews complaining about lack of content.  Did you perhaps purchase a copy with no packaging?  Because the copy I purchased listed the contents, in it's entirety, on the back.  If you didn't want to buy the album for only 4 new songs, why did you?  There are other options such as downloading the songs you like from somewhere reputable.  To rate an artist low and complain because you didn't do your due diligence is beyond my ability to fathom. <br /> <br />As far as the album, loved it!  I haven't purchased too many albums of late that I've listened to for over 8+ months.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Wow! This is such a great compilation containing all their hits. <br />In my opinion, this is all you need from Guns N' Roses, this Greatest Hits. This album contains one of my all time favorite <br />songs, Civil War, & November Rain.My other favorites on this <br />must be Paradise City. Don't Cry is beautiful but not as lovely <br />or as good as Foreigner's Waiting for a Girl Like You. 11-14 songs on this rock!!!! Buy this great collection along with <br />Green Day American Idiot or my other available albums. <br /> <br />Listen, I'm gonna play Heavy Fuel right now, <br />can I talk to you later? <br />BYE BYE.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|This comedy had everyone in our family laughing most of the way through it.  Kids loved it because all the 'stars' of this movie had super powers...each one was unique.  So it made for dazzling (if not cheezy) extra effects.  My seven year old loved this movie...he would give it a five star. For adults it was good, but you can predict the plot throughout...so it's not very imaginative...but for a family flick it's really good.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I heard a song on the radio off of this CD, and I would have bet my trailer home that it was U2!  I couldn't believe it!  Really I couldn't.  Anyways, the way I look at it, if you can't be original then why be a cheap imitation of rock's greatest band??  That's what I'd like to know.  The only reason that I think most people have any interest in these guys is that the lead singer is married to Gwyneth Paltrow.  You don't have to agree with me, but you've got to admit that I'm entitled to my opinion.  Keep the rubber side down, and I'll see you at Sturgis. Carry on.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I was interested in this movie because of all the hype and the nerd on the front.  I think I saw some trailers too but I can't remember. <br /> <br />This movie was good here and there but largely boring.  It definitely had potential but it was wasted.  It's mostly a bunch of retards moving around and talking, barely making sense sometimes.  If I wanted to watch a bunch of retards I would go to an assisted living facility, not waste the $5 on the movie rental fee. <br /> <br />They had a lot of material and they hit the mark sometimes but really they dropped the ball.  There are definitely some \\"LOL\\" moments but the rest of the time it's boring.  Also, the quotes people like to use from this movie are not that good.  This is definitely not a \\"Caddyshack\\" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />Don't listen to the hype.  It's good for a rental but that's it.  If I had to keep watching it I'd start getting violent.  Could have been better but it's not.
B000065V9Y|5.0|I love every song on this record. It'd have to be the most personal record from PG, an artist who generally makes music for you to get emotionally and/or intellectually involved with (though you don't have to to enjoy it). <br /> <br />There are many well written reviews already. I'm posting this mostly to say that everyone's take on \\"Steam\\" seems to be that it's about lust and/or sexuality. To me it's more than that. I think the bigger point of the song is positive energy and motivation (\\"steam\\" as in a steam engine). And of course the physical connection in sex (or maybe affection in general?) is definitely -the song makes clear- a big part of it. And you know actually that's still a pretty revolutionary concept, if you think about it _REALLY SERIOUSLY_. Pretty neat how it allows you to totally rock out while being really deep and introspective (haha). \\"Give me steam, and how you feel can make it real, real as any place you've been. Get a LIIIIIIIIIIIIIFE with the dreamer's dream\\". Surely not just about lust/the personal pursuit of sexual pleasure alone. Connection, motivation, going somewhere, doing something. Feeling/being a part of something that actually means something. Ok I guess that's enough. <br /> <br />\\"Secret World\\" is a part of this same theme I think too [suggested by it being uptempo (a little faster than \\"steam\\") and sharing some little parts]. Amazing song. May take a few listens for it to really hit you. <br /> <br />Same I guess goes for the album in general, at least for me. I was about 15 when I got it, and not surprisingly I didn't really get into it/give it much of a chance. How I wish there were artists with messages/meaning like this on rock or pop radio now, instead of all the negativity and emptiness and aghhh.  <br />And if only records made in 2005 SOUNDED as good as ones made in 92? Huh? What? Yeah. I don't even have the remastered one. Can people not hear how bad a lot of records sound now? I mean listen to (freakin') Bono's voice onthe latest u2 record? What the heck is up?  <br /> <br />Anyway, shutting up now... :)
0553103547|5.0|I just got down reading the book and it's great.  I can't wait to read the others in the series.  For those that think the sex parts are gross you need to seriously grow up.  This is the kind of stuff that was common in a time like this.  I think maybe those people should read a history book once in awhile.  It's pretty sad people.  I bet these people thought sex education was offensive in high school.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan can make good music. This album includes: variety, emotion, history, and well-written lyrics. It does not include filler and monotony. It is not a copy of something that someone else is doing.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|What is good music/songs? <br />This soundtrack is one of the greatest I ever heard. <br />It is heart moving from the first minute to the last. <br />Excellent recording and performances. <br />Composer's talent and lyrics are all no.1 class. <br />Simple guitar, piano and string arrangements perfect fit the movie, also stand out on it own. <br />I did not see the movie, but I did read Annie Proulx's Close range: Wyoming stories. This soundtrack got the spirit of the stories. <br />Brokeback mountain#1, #2 and #3 is similar but arrangements are to the heart you can feels the flow of music running thru your brain. <br />ONLY \\"Angel up in flamed\\" and \\"It so easy\\" with different tempo but they also match with the NORTH WEST atmosphere created in the music. <br />I, personally, deeply moved by the voice of Emmylou Harris sung \\"A love that will never grow old\\" IT IS JEWELLERY, simple is beauty. It got all the elements to win ANY award. <br />My ranking for songs, from top to bottom, is: A love that will never grow old, He's a friend of mine, The Maker makes, I don't want to say Goodbye, King of the Road, I will never let you go, No one love you like me, Devil's right hand ... <br /> <br />I am sure no one would be disappointed by this soundtrack. <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|I did not know that any other band could make music as bad as Linkin Park's. American Idiot proved me wrong.

0783219598|3.0|Bambi/Old Yeller/Dumbo tearjerkers repel me. We bought Babe after a decade of avoiding it, but the previews were so cute and there wasn't a hint of darkness, puppies and piggy laughing together! A crowing duck!<br /><br />Babe starts with a scene in which his mother is carted off to the slaughterhouse in a MEAT truck. Sheesh. On the farm we see bloody hatchets and meat hooks, and dogs ravaging and killing an old sheep named Maa that Babe has become attached to, and there is much discussion of animals headed for the dining room table.<br /><br />The second movie Babe, a Pig in the City, centers on a group of dogs and cats abandoned by their owners to starve in the streets, and their subsequent capture and imprisonment at a medical lab run by jack-booted thugs.<br /><br />Ham-fisted? Yes.<br /><br />If you buy this for the kids to watch after Christmas dinner, don't serve duck or ham, please.
0307276902|3.0|I've just finished reading \\"A million Little Pieces\\". It is a beautiful story. It is a painful story. But most importantly, it is a DANGEROUS story.  <br /> <br />  James Frey rivetingly captures the emotional roller-coaster ride that is addication and rehabilitation. His personal experiences at the center and his character studies ring authentic to this reader. I experienced much of what he went through(sans the love interest) with my own stay at a private rehabilitation center in New Jersey, some four years ago.  <br /> <br />   Frey manages to sucsessfully capture the horror, the pain, and eventually, even the slow, step by tiny step,process of recovery, but he fails repeatedly to identify the benchmarks in his recovery, and more importantly,he fails to indentify the true catylists that were so instrumentel in helping him to achieve those bench marks. <br /> <br />    I applaud James Frey for his unique recovery, and his years of subsequent sobrierty, but I worry that his book will inadvertanly send the wrong message to those that need it the most.There is a little narcissism in us all, and people with addictive personalities have more than thier fair share. Mr.Frey's memoir is frought with narcissism and therein lies its danger.  <br />   After reading his account one is led to believe that it was his will, perserverence, and a little help from the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" that made it possible for him to recover.The rehab staff and fellow patients that surrounded him were little more than suopportive sidekicks and distractions. <br />   Now here is where it gets tricky. As for A.A. and the twelve steps, he gives them little credence or respect throughout his recovery and at times he is  simply downright nasty in his critisism of the program. He pokes fun at it and at those who believe in it and are trying to help him. <br /> <br /> Here in lies the problem with his memoir, and also why the book is dangerous. Each step of the way as he begins to recover, he states that hehis doing it all on his own and then he takes pot- shots at the twelve-step program, repeatedly telling the reader that the program is just trading addictions, and it is not for him. But in reality, he is doing exactly what he denies and abhors. By his own described actions, he is unwittingly,doing the very steps that he denies so vehemently. <br /> <br />  His descison to stay is the first step. His acceptance of Leonard and the Tao are steps two and three. His admsiions to his family, to Lilly, and to his friends is the fourth step asnd the fifth step is the climax of the book where he writes out his list and frees his soul.He discards the notion of a higher power throughout the book. Well, if leonard, Lilly and the Tao don't represent his higher power, I don't know what does.  <br /> <br />    I am glad Jim Frey remains sober today and I am also glad that his book had become so popular, but I can't help but worry that somewhere out there in thes big world of ours there is someone reading his book and looking for guidence with their own addiction and they will not be able to follow his path. Very few can. A.A. worked for him, whether he chooses to admit it or not and it has worked for millions of others. Less than 2 percent of addicts are able to do what James Frey claims he has done. Readers, be inspired by his road to recovery, but please don't try and follow his proclaimed path. it won't work.  <br />
0767836286|5.0|This movie single handedly made me a huge Jeff Bridges fan. I have always loved the quirky Tim Robbins movies, so this was a double pleasure! <br /> <br />This is a suspencful, yet not pure eye candy thriller. There are a lot of reali life comaprisons to resistance groups spread all over the US ready to overthrow and show their disconent for the government while they end up punishing innocent people. <br /> <br />Bridges plays a College professor, who teaches a class on Terrorism, and little does he know that his own life is starting to follow the down spiral of the very bad things he teaches. <br /> <br />He becomes fast firends with the neighbours across the street as he saves their son one day. As he is enjoying the new friendship  weird things keep occuring. There are suspicious things that they dont want him to see in the house, and when he tries to do his own spying to see what is going on, he finds out more than he can handle. <br /> <br />THis movie is really easy to spoil so I wont say any more, but it's a seat gripping thriller, that I am still pondering  in my head.   <br /> <br />The ending was incredible, and not a guesser. It left me with my mouth open, and my thoughts running. <br /> <br />Wonderful,  well done and intelligent movie!
B00005JNJV|4.0|I really had never got into the batman story. I really didn't like some of the older batman movies. I didn't give this movie a chance but saw it at a party. It really surprised me how good this movie was. It had brilliant acting and Batman was really cool. It won me over. Awesome Movie
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is an extremely valuable presentation of both some of the causes, and the conduct of the battles, of the greatest war the world has ever known.  This is vital history to which every educated person should be exposed, lest we repeate history for want of knowing it.<br /><br />The World At War features some absolutely magnificent analysis of World War Two.  Particularly good were the segments that dealt with the rise of Hitler and Nazism (\\"A New Germany,\\" \\"Hitler's Germany\\") and the battles on the Eastern Front (\\"Red Star\\").  I would say that this series does have a notable British orientation in that the War in the Pacific is emphasized far less than the European Theater.  Further, the battles of Singapore, and the struggle around the Burma Road get almost as much analysis as America's drive across the Central Pacific, which was the real center of gravity of the Pacific War.  These are minor quibbles, however; this is a fine series.<br /><br />A few criticisms.  The segment dealing with the allies' relations with Stalin immediately following victory features (I swear to God) an interview with -- Alger Hiss!-- who is presented only as a \\"State Department Official\\" or somesuch.  Hiss, of course, was jailed for denying falsely, under oath, that he was a Soviet/Communist agent.  This film makes no mention of the rather critical detail that not only was Hiss, as a Soviet agent, perhaps a bit pro-Soviet in his bias, but he was also one of those charged with briefing President Truman.  This seems to me to be a rather unforgivable lapse in historical perspective, but I digress.<br /><br />The above quibbles are minor in comparison to this overall very superb historical achievement.  This is a wonderful presentation of the war, thoughtful and at times profound.  The DVDs are nicely packaged for easy access to any particular episode, and my copy seemed to be perfect in every respect.  Viewers over 45 (me!) will need reading glasses to read the volume numbers on the DVD covers, however.  I guess they couldn't find any smaller type.<br /><br />This is a wonderful series, head and shoulders above most presentations dealing with the Second World War.  It will an asset to which the discerning viewer will return many times.DVD covers, however.

B00082IJ08|5.0|This is by far the best cd of 2005! I'm not usaually into the \\"newer stuff\\" that comes out these days but this band is incredible. They have a sound all their own and the \\"band \\" concept is great too. I can't wait until they get the tour on the road, it should be another ground breaking event just as their music is. If your tired of all the same old stuff you hear that sounds like everything else on the radio today, buy this cd. You won't be disappointed!
B000002I27|5.0|This is one of the band's strongest albums. Only one weak track on this album (I Can't See Your Face In My Mind) in my opinion. The album opens up with the eerie keyboard opening on the title track. Afterwards is You're Lost Little Girl, which I enjoy. The next big standout is Love Me Two Times, with great guitar work by Krieger. Moonlight Drive is an upbeat song, it's not my favorite, but it's still good. People Are Strange, one of my all time favorites by the band, follows. Afterwards is My Eyes Have Seen you, which I really enjoy because of its great bass and guitar work. After the weakest track on the album comes When the Music's Over, a drug induced and mellow finisher. I'm not really a fand of the band's mellow stuff, but I liked this ending. So in summary: <br /> <br />Excellent - Strange Days, You're Lost Little Girl, Love Me Two Times, People Are Strange, My Eyes Have Seen You, When the Music's Over <br /> <br />Solid - Unhappy Girl, Horse Latitudes <br /> <br />Weak - I Can't See Your Face In My Mind <br /> <br />This album is a must have for any Doors fan, new or old.
1400031354|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith does it again. This charming humorous delightful tale centering on the lady detective,Precious Ramotswe, is a quick read. Using unpretentious language Precious Ramotswe dispenses kernals of wisdom throughout the story.  Further, the reader is drawn into the mysteries of her investigations and the careful way in which Precious reads the character of other people.  We are now further introduced to her fiance, the mechanic,Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and her secretary, Mma Makutsi. Precious understands the importance of human dignity, and she makes sure to preserve that dignity in both the deserving and undeserving whenever possible. However, she is able to tease the truth out of liars and other dishonest people.   She does so without rancor or unneccessary unkindness. She is manipulative only when neccessary. However, she puts the cocky and supercilious in their place while still maintaining her own dignity.  In some ways she is very naive and unworldly, but in dealing with human nature she is wise beyond her years. We can all learn a thing or two from Mme. Ramotswe.
B000002I2G|4.0|This is certainly not the best Doors album (that right is reserved for LA Woman). But it's still a good album. And it's usually overlooked. With staples such as Touch Me and Wild Child it shouldn't be. The tracks are all solid. Although I find Easy Ride and Runnin' Blue a little too upbeat, they're still solid tracks. My personal favorite on the album is Touch Me, their principle hit off of the album. Other standouts include Wild Child, Shaman's Blues, and the title track. All in all, a good but overlooked album in the Doors' catalog.
B000059T1E|5.0|YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET THE \\"IMPORT\\" VERSION INSTEAD <br /> <br />There have been several different versions of this CD.  This latest version has remastered sound and two bonus tracks.  You might want to get the \\"Import\\" version instead.  It has two more tracks that were originally supposed to be on a live album. <br /> <br />The two bonus tracks here are studio leftovers.  They are not very good songs and certainly not up to the par with the original album.  Worse still, the horrible \\"I Just Want You To Know\\" is stuck in the middle of the original material, instead of tacked on to the end. <br /> <br />As a group, Traffic broke up after every album, and then reunited for the next one.  John Barleycorn Must Die is different in that it originally started out as a Steve Winwood solo album.  He even had two songs recorded, before bringing in Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi. <br /> <br />The sound on this album is very different than any other Traffic album.  It is more accoustic sounding.  It is very atmospheric, and muted, taking full advantage of Winwood's soulful vocals.  (Adding in that bonus track in the middle really upset the atmosphere). <br /> <br />This is their fourth album and much better than the first three.  Those have a dated, British sixties, psychodelic sound to them.  But, there are still some great tracks on those albums. <br /> <br />The albums that follow, Low Spark and Shoot Out have a sound similar to John Barleycorn, only with a brighter and heavier rock sound. <br /> <br />Chris Wood died in the eighties and Capaldi died last year.
1400032717|4.0|A lovely and beautifully written little novel that never loses the reader's faith. I think this would be a superb book for teaching fiction to high school and college students. What it does, it does perfectly, and I can't wait for his next novel.
B00002MHS1|5.0|There have been a number of different versions of this CD.  There is a US, remastered version that does not have the live bonus track (but keeps the bad bonus studio tracks).  It is less than half the price of this \\"Import\\" CD.      There are five bonus tracks on this album.  The studio tracks I Just Want You To Know and Sitting Here, Thinking Of My Love are pretty bad.  They are nothing like Traffic has done.  They sound like they were meant to be AM radio hits.  What's worse, is that I Just Want You To Know is stuck right in the middle of the original material.  It really upsets the flow of the original album.    The three live bonus tracks are an introduction to the band, a 7 minute Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring and a 12 minute Glad, with following Freedom Ride hacked off.  As the liner notes explain, Traffic was due to release a live album, but that was scrapped.  The group was Winwood, Capaldi and Wood with Rich Grech.    I really like the two live tracks.  I like the version of Glad better than the one on On The Road.  The sound quality is a little off (like there is some wow and flutter to the tape), but I think it gives the music a unique, eerie feel to it.  It really sets the type of atmosphere that you get at a great concert where the music takes you somewhere else.    The original album is one of Traffic's best.  It has different sound than the earlier Traffic albums.  It really makes good use of Winwood's soulful voice.  Later Traffic albums would be brighter and more rock oriented.    This was originally going to be a Winwood solo album and it sounds like it in parts.  With Winwood overdubbing most of the instruments, the album has a unique sound to it.  It certainly does not sound like a typical rock album.        Note that both Capaldi and Wood have died.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Is the release date someone's idea of a joke?   <br /> <br />I'm sure glad I ponied up the $50 for the bootleg.  It beats fastforwarding and/or rewinding!
B00005NB0H|5.0|It is amazing that a few songs recorded live more than 30 years ago could sound so great today! The sound is raw, live, yet crystal clear. The band effortlessly transitions from hard edged, pulse pounding, hard driving rock and roll, to delicately beautiful vocal and musical harmonies and melodies, often many times within a single song. (The Who was truly unique in this regard, in their time.) Townsend is practically ripping his guitar strings to shreds at one moment, and picking out a subdued melody in the next. I believe it was Townsend who once said Keith Moon thinks of the drums as a lead instrument, and I feel there is no great capture of Moon's talent than this recording. He truly was one of the world's most gifted rock drummers, and he had a style that was all his own. He is so fast at times, it is difficult not to think that there must have been 2 drummers. <br /> <br />Turn this album up and at some points it's so overwhelming that you can barely think, your blood will be rushing, and at other times so quiet you could almost hear a pin drop. The audience was obviously spell bound by the performance. <br /> <br />I am a long time Who fan, but forget about that. Even if you've never heard The Who before, if you have any interest in rock and roll, at it's roots, at it's greatest, in it's prime, you must hear this recording. You will have a new appreciation for the talents of these musicians after really listening to this album. It is, in my opinion, simply the greatest live album of all time, by one of the great live bands of all time, at the peak of their prime. Get It.
B000AARKOO|1.0|In \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", Orlando Bloom continues to distinguish himself in Hollywood as the consummate actor to recite interminable monologues at. He is an exposition magnet, a shimmering bull's-eye at which every symbolic line, bloated with meaning, may be targeted. \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" advances from one screen test to the next, with more competent actors reading their lines to an idiot savant whose one talent is the ability to unceasingly hold a vacuous, perplexed look on his oh-so-hunky sloping brow. Whenever he comes into frame with a fellow actor, the audience is threatened with another twenty minute diatribe during which Bloom must try not to drool, and the audience must try not to go to sleep. <br /> <br />For the viewers: Get up, go do some errands about the house, find something to occupy yourself once the jawing and scenery-chewing begins, it will proceed without you, and no matter how long you take, it will still be going by the time you get back. Try not to think too much about the moral lessons on freedom, justice, and \\"being a perfect knight\\" coming from Bloom's adulterous, priest-murdering, blacksmith-turned-insta-fighter. Ignore the fact that never has there been such a mind-numbingly boring adulterous, priest-murdering knight. Just put on your pewter-leper's mask, start growling at the screen like Jeremy Irons (who seems to forget he is not doing a voiceover and that he actually is on camera), and comfort yourself with the thought that Pirates of the Caribbean parts II and III are just around the corner. <br />
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Mediocre Matrix rip off with a twist finds poor Keanu Reeves trying to rip off his own series with a supernatural tale that has one bad clich after the next and doing a really bad job on top of that.. The director barely scrapes by with the bad script that everybody had to work with and the special effects are sub par for a movie of this size. I agree with the majority who wrote that only Rachel Weisz is fine here with a better than this film deserved performance but other than her effort, the movie just is not worth your time.  <br /> <br />Avoid, it's really that bad. <br />
0446577383|1.0|The story line and the characters were nowhere near believeable. I thought as did another reviewer that this book was written by someone else. It went to the bestseller list based on the Baldacci name. That name has now been used to make political statements wrapped in a novel, and thats something that always annoys me when I read action fiction,whether I agree with the statements or not.
6304765789|4.0|Directed by David Fincher, 1997's \\"The Game\\" is a very cleverly constructed and engaging thriller, although the implausibility of the whole 'game' leaves one with such a \\"give me a break\\" taste in their mouth that it simply can't be hailed as a masterpiece.    Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an incredibly wealthy investment banker who seems to be incredibly miserable, partly because of the daily grind of his work, and also because he's divorced and basically lives alone. His brother Conrad (Sean Penn) is seemingly aware of this, and in attempt to 'spice things up' for Nick, tells him about a suspicious company he should call named CRS, i.e. Consumer Recreation Services. Conrad tells his brother he's called them before and that they gave him a life changing experience in his own right. Nick ultimately gives in to temptation, not really knowing what he's getting into, and before he knows it, the 'game' begins.    On the positive side, the mostly dark cinematography of the movie is extremely fitting and effective, and with the construction of the script being as engagingly clever as it is, we don't get the first real inkling as to just how impossibly far-fetched it all is until about  of the way into this 2+ hour film. And the movie's 'big climax' IS suspenseful and surprising, albeit ultimately outrageous, and the final scene amusingly provides one last macabre twist.      The film is also a tour-de-force for Michael Douglas, who appears in every single scene.  It really is intriguing to watch a painstakingly maintained control freak have the proverbial rugs pulled out from under him at every turn, and Douglas is perfect for the role--intense, yet natural, and capturing the various emotions of his character masterfully.  Deborah Kara Unger's performance is also memorable--Douglas and she have an excellent on-screen chemistry.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, strikes me as being considerably miscast, but he doesn't have that much screen time anyway.    In the end, this is a better-than-average thriller. It's highly entertaining despite its extreme implausibility and the rather underwhelming & laughable ending.
0156027321|5.0|After recently having a run of bad-book luck, I decided to re-read one I knew I'd enjoy.  I loved Life of Pi the first time, and I loved it the second time as well. <br /> <br />I won't go into detail about the plot; there's plenty of reviews here that cover that.  On the surface it's about a boy stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific ocean with a tiger...but there are multiple levels of meaning to the story.  You've probably read that the book promises to make you believe in god...well that is questionable, but it does make you believe in the power of perception and attitude.  The ending blew me away - can't say much without giving it away, but I thought about this book for weeks after finishing. <br /> <br />Life of Pi is just such a great story.  I love the characters - mainly Pi and the tiger.  This book is so well-written that it made me love a tiger.  It is one of the rare books that kept me up reading too late and I was so sad to find myself nearing the end of it.  It is a book I have bought for numerous friends and is one of the few that I will continue to re-read.  I envy anyone who hasn't yet read it because my only regret is that I can't read it again for the first time.
B00005JNJV|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is one of the classier comic book adaptions of recent years. While it has far less in common with the DC comic book than one might think, virtually all the changes made to the characters and their history were essential for an audience that remembers the Tim Burton Batman films but seldom (if ever) reads a Batman comic book.  <br /> <br />This DVD is the single-disc version of the film, without most of the extras that the two-DVD set contains. Be aware of this before you order. If the extras are what you'd like, go for the two-DVD set. If not, used versions of the single-disc version are cheaply and readily available. <br /> <br />The film traces Bruce Wayne's journey from an embittered and self-destructive young man into his metamorphosis into a mysterious and powerful urban vigillante. Christian Bale throws himself into the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman, giving us the best Batman since Michael Keaton. He's also given ample support from a Who's Who of Hollywood blockbusters - including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, and Cillian Murphy. Along the way, there are strong echoes of the Tim Burton films, through the character designs, music, and general mood. There are also some top-notch action sequences, including one of the strangest car chases you're likely to see. <br /> <br />The film isn't entirely successful due to the almost total lack of chemistry between Bale and Holmes, and the absence of a truly gripping villain. Coming on the heels of the \\"Spiderman\\" movies, \\"Batman Begin\\" has villians whose motivations are far too shadowy to fathom. Liam Neeson turns in a fine performance as Ra's Al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy is appropriately eerie as the Scarecrow, but neither character is fleshed out enough (or over-the-top enough)to command our attention the way Jack Nicholson did as the Joker many years ago. <br /> <br />Still, this is a great start to what will hopefully be a long-running and successful series. This is a movie well worth watching again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Back in 2002, Firefly was the promising new sci-fi show on Fox cursed with such a horrible string of bad executive decisions, it's a miracle how it managed to gain a dedicated following. The network insisted on various changes to the show; they aired episodes in a different order than its creators intended; they even cropped the picture to a 4:3 aspect ratio for TV, although it was meant to be shown in widescreen. No wonder it eventually got canceled halfway through the season with three more episodes made but never aired.  <br /> <br />All this, I've only learned recently, as with 2005 came the release of Serenity, the motion picture, which has lead a whole new bunch of us to discover this interesting world. Having seen the movie, I was aching for more. As luck would have it, this time there actually was more: this very DVD set, Firefly - The Complete Series.  <br /> <br />I'm happy to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every way. On its own, the untimely cancellation of the show make Firefly hard to recommend without any reservations. Couple it with Serenity, however, and they make a thoroughly excellent package together. With Firefly, you get 675 more minutes of the same great cast of characters and many more of their interesting adventures, although each understandably somewhat less grandiose than that of the movie.  <br /> <br />Even the bonus features are impeccable. Of the 14 episodes, exactly half of them got a commentary track, each with a different set of people. Four of the cast are featured at least one once: Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Staite and Morena Baccarin. And of course, Joss Whedon, the brains behind the project, is along in three of them to share his thoughts. Beyond that, there's a gag reel, deleted scenes, behind the scenes features, and more.  <br /> <br />Really, the fact that this was released on 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, the same studio which so mistreated the show on TV, is no cause for concern. This DVD set does Firefly justice and treats it with the respect it always deserved.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is, you'll want to pick up both this and the Serenity DVD. That the two are unlikely to ever get officially bundled together is only because they were produced by different studios.
B0007P3582|1.0|The fact that this album is the top selling album of the year just shows how musical taste amongst the kids nowdays has deteriated.  It is said that John Lennon once wrote a great song in ten minutes.  50 Cent couldn't write a great song in ten years!   <br /> <br />Trivia: How 50 Cent got his name: <br />When he was poor and living on the streets instead of asking for quarters he would ask for 50 cent pieces.  Either he was very greedy or he thought it was cool and different.  <br /> <br />As for the album itself there is not one redeeming vaule about it whatsoever.  It is truly a massacre on your mentality.  The biggest hit off the album, \\"Candy Shop\\", talks about licking lollipops, riding women like low riders and other things I can't talk about here on this site.  Now isn't that exactly what kids need to hear nowdays?  And we wonder why AIDS and other STDs are so rampant today.  Regardless this song topped the charts and kids who are brainwashed on MTV buy it and listen to it. <br /> <br />The word N****** and the F word are used more often than the words, \\"the\\", or \\"it\\".  Women are no longer called women but are called ho's and other degrading terms.  No, I didn't buy the album, but I've heard enough from what my peers at my local college listen to to get the idea.  Kids I know were fine until they started listening to this album and now they can't say a single sentence without letting a profane word slip <br /> <br />On a postive note, I'm glad he survived getting shot because no person deserves to die regardless of how badly they messed up the world.  I'm certainly not glad that he is poisoning the world with his profanity and demented philosophy.  You're better off spending your money on a classic rock or classic pop album than this garbage.
B000002JSJ|2.0|In all fairness, I should give Presence one star. Out of it's seven songs, only one doesn't fall flat on it's face. The rest of the album is unlistenable, and virtually nothing here works. It's worse than its followup, In Through the Out Door...and that's really saying something.<br />So, what justifies two stars? Achilles Last Stand, the aforementioned good song, is arguably the best song in the Zeppelin catalogue. Don't get fooled by it's length, that's ten-and-a-half minutes of pure POWER. Sadly, the rest of the album ranges in quality from poor (Hots On for Nowhere) to nearly unlistenable (Tea For One). Every song simply sounds the same, with the exception of Achilles Last Stand. No quirky experiments with Eastern, folk or funk, part of what made Houses of the Holy and Physical Graffiti such good albums It kicks off in the right direction, but quickly spirals into disaster. Oh yeah, and the lyrics sound like someone opened up a can of Zeppelin cliches and  dumped them everywhere. Some Zeppelin albums work (the debut, II, Houses, Graffiti). This is not one.<br />To end this review, you don't even need to buy this album for Achilles Last Stand. You get it on the Lattter Days compilation. So why waste 15 bucks on this one?
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|You can truly get lost in this wonderfully recorded cd. The combination of theses two latin forces is magical. I have never listened to or head of either of these men. The first time i heard it, i was taken back by the passion in diego el cigala's voice. This is a must own. Buy It.
B000002JSP|1.0|My opinion about the two good songs on this album (Carouselambra and Hot Dog) will frequently change. While Hot Dog is fun, it's certainly pretty stupid and nowhere near the heights the group previously released. And I can't decide of Carouselambra is an epic, or a pretentious piece of keyboard-driven garbage.<br /><br />The rest is sad, especially considering that this is Led Zeppelin, often hailed as the Greatest Band Ever (even when they're not). I'm willing to bet that this is the group's weakest album, yes it's even worse than Presence. Though it contains more good songs than Presence does, neither Carouselambra nor Hot Dog match, or even touch, Achilles Last Stand. The rest, meanwhile, is synth-driven soft-rock...All My Love sounds dangerously close to ABBA, sadly enough. As do Fool in the Rain and Southbound Suarez. Oh, don't fall for how I'm Gonna Crawl is often considered their \\"return to the blues\\". It's closer to softrock than anything else.<br /><br />You have been warned. Do NOT buy this.
B0000CNY27|5.0|One of the coolest films ive seen.And one of John Carpenter best.This film is a true classic of cool sci-fi/b movie style genre.Brought to us by a true master of genre cinema.This film couldn't have been more fun of a ride.    New York 1997 is now a maximum security prison.Snake Plisken (Kurt Russel) is on his way in until a unidentified aircraft entering the airspace above Manhattan crashes in the prison.When identifying the aircraft its Air Force One.The head of the prison Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) sends Snake inside with a job to bring the president back and in return they will give a pardon.Once inside Snake's on his own.Dealings with prisoners,old friends savings his own life and getting the president from the hands of the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes) he got his hands full.    This film made on a small budget around 5 to 7 million.For such a aspiring project that earned 50 million in the box office all around the world made this film a hit for John Carpenter.After making Halloween that was a big success Carpenter got a two picture deal this and The Fog.Good thing they gave it or we wouldn't have got this cool flick.John Carpenter is very underrated director.And I mean underrated to the general public not to the faithful cult film crowds.This film is cult film.Many people don't like this film for the fact that it looks fake or silly and the effects are cheasy.This film was made for a specific crowd that was going understand and enjoy this film.This is not a film for the broad public.When I mean this not a general film for everybody.Example of a cult film with generally known film.Evil Dead and The Exorscist.Evil Dead is a cult film that was made for the cult crowd and horror fans.People in the U.S. will probably know this film instead outside the U.S. its not as known as the Exorscist.If you say to someone to mention one horror film most people will mention The Exorscist.Also this film is not as easy to approach to audiences as Titanic or Lord Of The Rings.About the effects that don't look good.I personally like the effects.One it's the 80's.Two the film had a small budget and three the effects the way it looks add the feel and the look of the film.     This film has great cast.To start off Kurt Russell.When casting for the film began Kurt Russell was first choice for the part only for John Carpenter.The producers didn't think he was the right one for the part and gave Carpenter choices to cast someone else which the names they had mention were Charles Bronson and Tommy Lee Jones.Two great actors but he had deny them so he could create one of the best cinema collaborations him and Kurt Russell.Kurt Russell created a cult classic hero in the process.In the film we get the honor of having the great Lee Van Cleef that we all remember from films like High Noon and The Good The Bad & The Ugly.Carpenter cast him is really a show of his love towards the films Lee Van Cleef had played in and his acting.Also we get other great actors Harry Dean Stanton that really is a underrated actor.And the guy that playes the Duck of New York Issac Hayes.Two great actors one towards cult cinema and the other one towards exploitation films.And the other cast member  that is also a frequent collaborator with Carpenter Donald Pleasance.This film also includes the acting talent of academy award winner Ernest Borgine and Adrianne Barbeau.    Most of John Carpenter films deal with violence,horror,science fiction and social commentary.Each of his films are very original,that's my most of his films are admired from Halloween to They Live to Assault On Precint 13.All of his films are made with lots of love towards cinema and to the genres he directs.In this film there is a little social commentary.In two movies that you can see social commentary on the government are this and They Live.In this one as we see in Snake Plisken as how he talks about the government and we see how the government is acting.The whole country is mplied to be upside down and there being some sort of anarchy against the government. Technically in the film like Snake mentions the government is not really the good guy.    The DVD has two commentary tracks one with director John Carpenter and Kurt Russel.Its a nice track imformative on many little details.The second commentary track is with producer Debra Hill and production designer Joe Alves.This is also a informative track but really towards the technical aspects of the film.The weird thing about both tracks are that they were recorded a long time before production of the DVD.So what makes me wonder what were they thinking of making a audio track if there was no real reason or the pre production of the DVD is on of the longest ever that is really hard to believe.Other special features are first a brand new documentary Return to Escape from New York that runs twenty three minutes with interviews with cast and crew and discussions on the creation of the film,script and the creations of the characters.After the documentary there is a deleted scene that was originally the start of the film.It shows how Snake Plisken got originally in trouble in a bank robbery.It runs for about ten minutes.There are also three trailers,a theatrical trailer,the shorter promo trailer and odd trailer entitled Snake Bites, which basically tells you what happens in the entire movie in four minutes stupid if you ask me for that trailer to exist.    Well that's it.The special edition of Escape From New York.Only John Carpenter and few other directors can make such good genre films that are really cool.This a cult classic you should check out.

1400032717|4.0|Haddon does a superb job of capturing the idiosyncrasies of the autistic, and has combined all of these to create a truly believable character in Christopher. This story is incredibly moving and really makes you both love Christopher and sympathize with his way of viewing the world. From his need to mathematically analyze things, to his hatred of the color yellow, Christopher offers a different, but extremely logical way of looking at the world that makes one stop and say to themselves: \\"why didn't I think of it that way.\\" <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen Firefly and had only vaguely heard it mentioned by a few of my friends.  Serenity was a delight.  It was one of the few movies I have seen in my lifetime that comes close to the magnificent character chemistry and science fiction intrigue that was provided by the original Star Wars trilogy.  Matching up to Star Wars is certainly a tall order, but I honestly feel that this is as close as you can get. <br /> <br />Having watched Serenity I quickly borrowed my friend's copy of the Firefly boxed set.  Firefly and Serenity are truly outstanding.  I would highly recommend this movie and series to anyone without hesitation.
0192833669|5.0|To all the fools who gave this masterpiece three stars or less: I pity you and your pathetic view of literature.<br /><br />To those who gave it 4 stars or more: you have my thanks and congratulations as true literary conoisseurs.<br /><br />To those who have not yet read the story, ignore the reviews and draw your own conclusions after you have done so.<br /><br />To those who complain that the birth of the creature was underwritten, consider this: Frankenstein did not wish for anyone, ANYONE, to have the knowledge and/or the ability to repeat his mistake. Thus, he deliberately left the birth of his creation vague in order to prevent any details of his knowledge from escaping into the world.<br /><br />Next time you read a book, perhaps you should actually READ it rather than just looking at the pretty letters.

0684833395|5.0|It is of the essence of every great piece of literature that at least some portions of the story do not make any particular amount of sense. <br /> <br />This entire book is like that. <br /> <br />Catch-22, in a nutshell, is one of the most bizarre, nonsensical, BRILLIANT books you are ever likely to read. The book is described as being the epitome of insanity because it is about life, an insane state of being. Catch-22 is a documentary of society and the pointlessness of war, but makes it points in such an odd fashion that the book may be lost on those without the cranial capacity to live as humans and who are instead content to live in sewers of humanity with only its dregs for companionship. <br /> <br />But don't take my word for it. Read it yourself.

B000BBOUU4|2.0|i found this movie to be nothing what i expected. obviously hoping that it'd be a fun, updated wacky (Burtonish?) version of the original... I instead came upon a strange, unfunny retelling of our beloved first film. and please don't misunderstand... i absolutely love Tim Burton and his films, and am one of Johnny Depp's biggest fans... yet i found Depp's performance awkward, and the film itself not warm, endearing or funny. <br /> <br />and what was with the single computer-cloned oompa loompa? and the overly serious child contestants? in the original they may have been brats, but at least they were funny. everything has such a serious, somber overtone here... <br /> <br />i guess it's worth a look, maybe a rental, but overall for me, this was a real disappointment. please go find Gene Wilder instead. that's your true Wonka story.
0792838068|1.0|This was the worst movie I ever watched.  I kept watching it thinking there would be SOME moment of redemption, something worth the cost of the rental!  I wished at the end that I had given up on it as quickly as the characters gave up on themselves.  I think the character Nicholas Cage played was as addicted to self-pity as he was to alcohol.  Okay, maybe there are people out there who let themselves get this bad, but do the rest of us really need to watch it for 2 hours?  I couldn't believe this movie won so many awards.
B00005JO1P|3.0|The story basically was about how Johnny wanted June very badly, and how long it took for them to get together. After they get together, the movie ends quickly. I dont know Johnny or June to much, the acting was good but not excellent. I thought Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job as June though. The part that I rolled my eyes at was an almost minute scene with Johnny with Waylon Jennings, who was played by his son, Skeeter Jennings. I thought it was a little tacky and would have prefered to see someone play Bob Dylan. Plus forget to tell the story about Johnny kicking out the lights at the Grand Ol Opry. That would have been cool to see. Go see it for Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, other then that, a weak biography of the man in black.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I think I appreciated this movie more because it was filmed on Tiger Trail, the road on which my high school was located. (Dunnellon, Florida) The first half hour taught me what people mean when they say their skin crawled.   <br /> <br />A funny thing for anyone who watched this movie... My mother saw it in the theater, then walked into a store, and suddenly the song came on the radio.  My little brother watched it, walked out, and a cat crossed his path.  As he tried to call my mother to tell her about that, his cell phone died.  The church from the scene with the bodies really DID burn down in real life, not too long after the movie was made.  And of course, they had no control over those crows. <br /> <br />Also, the line about the highway going through several states made me chuckle a little, because Tiger Trail is only a few miles long.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Don't we all love a film that begs, nay, demands a second or even third viewing?  Eternal Sunshine requires great concentration but not laborious concentration although the subject matter can get a bit weighty when examining the metaphysical questions that the film raises.  While the movie appears disjointed, it untwists itself to reveal a masterful story that has very few obvious holes other than the fanciful idea that memories could be selectively erased. <br /> <br />We begin in the apartment of Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) as he awakens, seemingly deliriously, and begins his day -- Valentine's Day.  On his way to work, he finds that his car has been dented, allowing the audience to relate to his character instantly.  He's a brooding, self-effacing 30 something who's quite amiable when engaged but withdrawn.  Impulsively, he decides to call in sick and hop a train to the beach.  Of course, the beach is frigid, and, for that reason, is deserted save for a girl in a bright orange sweatshirt, Clementine.  As the only two crazy enough to visit the beach in February, they seem to have an instant connection although their personalities are diametrical: Joel is an introvert, and Clementine is an extrovert.  Clementine engages Joel, and they begin a firecracker relationship that begins with a visit to the Charles River.   <br /> <br />The sanguine to his melancholy, Clementine seems to breathe life into the boring Joel, but just like that, she's gone.  After a fight, Joel tries to reconcile the situation, but Clementine acts like she's never met him before.  Confused, Joel seeks the advice of his friends, one of which, informs him that Clementine has had all of her memories of Joel erased by a company named Lacuna.  In disbelief, Joel visits the \\"clinic\\" only to have his fear confirmed: Clementine has indeed erased Joel from her memory.  Joel decides that he too will have the procedure because it's too painful for him to remember her.  During the procedure, Joel is forced to reflect on his memories of Clementine, and he realizes that there were a lot of good times, great times.   <br /> <br />Joel has a change of heart, but the procedure has begun, and there's no turning back.  Fighting to keep his memory of Clementine alive, we embark on a strange, imaginative (figuratively and literal) journey that evokes the full gamut of emotions.  We're forced to confront how we conduct ourselves in and out of relationships.  Ultimately, we see the best and worst sides of human nature, from the manipulative to the purely altruistic, and how they play a role, for better or worse, in a relationship. <br /> <br />Jim Carrey delivers a knock out performance with Kate Winslet stealing her fair share of scenes herself.  The plot twists are superb and keep you guessing throughout the first viewing.  Thanks to the disjointed timeline, we're kept one step behind, but we piece the story together to uncover the puzzle, jerking a tear or two and busting a gut along the way.  I watched the movie with my brother the first time, and he thought it was stupid.  For me, I was floored.  It spoke to me.  You will likely either love or find it over-hyped.  I had to watch it again, and it flies by the second time.  I could watch it over and over again because there are so many different takes on the message.  It's a must see for anybody who's ever been in a relationship.

1593072937|5.0|Having fallen under the gritty, mesmerizing spell of the Sin City motion picture, I was very interested in exploring the original graphic novels from which the movie was drawn.  The Hard Goodbye is by far the most impressive sequence in the movie, so it was a real treat to be able to sit down and go through the original story and artwork.  This is especially the case since the film brings the story to life almost frame by frame.  In a sense, if you've seen the movie, you've seen the graphic novel - yet there is more depth and atmosphere on these pages than any movie can reproduce.<br /><br />Marv is just a fantastic character, a big, ugly lug of a guy who grew up hard and never experienced anything real in his interaction with his fellow human beings - not until the night he met Goldie, a beautiful woman who was kind to him and made him feel truly alive for the first time in his life.  When Marv wakes up to find Goldie dead and the cops closing in on him in what is obviously a frame-up, he basically devotes his life to finding Goldie's killer and making him pay - long and hard.  We watch as he beats up and kills his way to the truth, on a pathway that takes him to the highest echelons of Sin City society and power.  Marv's a funny guy, in his own way, and you can't help but root him on with all your might.<br /><br />This book, like every Sin City offering, is very dark and full of violence.  Miller has a very distinctive artistic style that fits his subject and his film noir-ish genre perfectly - although I must admit that I sometimes have a hard time really seeing what I'm looking at in certain frames.  A lot of people can write excellent stories, and quite a few can produce unique, stunning drawings, but it's rare indeed to find a man who has mastered both arts and combined them in such a magical way.  The book is filled with stereotypical characters who defy their stereotypes, unabashedly bold, striking black and white artwork, and a dark, noir-ish atmosphere that completely draws you in not only to the story but also to the city itself.  Sin City is about much more than \\"booze, broads and guns,\\" and The Hard Goodbye is a remarkable achievement in an underappreciated genre.phere that completely draws you in not only to the story but also to the city itself.

B000068PQ7|5.0|In the beginning was the light and the light was of the lord and the light was the lord... here Gene Clark touches upon the timeless essence of some greater spirit.  White Light speaks with an inspired voice... the voice of an artist bound in this world, but seeking some other.  The material he works with transcends the limitations of language:  The album opens with The Virgin -- perhaps a reference to some beginning point or a moment of demarcation, an origin of the seeker.  With Tomorrow, the second track, is sublime, is gentle, is woven as a rich tapestry of words.  White Light follows the path of the seeker (Gene himself?) is a sort of alchemy of words (a la Rimbaud?).  For a Spanish Guitar, the 6th song, is rich and alluring, compelling even!  Tears of Rage (the 8th track) is filled with human passion -- a search which must ultimately fail in this world.  Of the bonus tracks, Opening Day and Winter In stand out as musings, wanderings (of Cain?), which begin, perhaps nowhere, and neander through wor[l]ds rich in image and allusion.  But... Ship of the Lord, a spiritual, stands as an inward plea for some sort of redemption of the seeker -- inspite of its relaxed outward presentation.  Here, within the journeys offered by this supreme album, we find Gene at his best:  caught between ups and downs, between the flesh and the redemption, between darkness and white light... and all of this enmeshed in a rich and hauntingly spare tapestry of sounds and words.  Here Gene touches logos...

If you buy it you'll want to kill yourself.  If you have a choice of having a tooth pulled and an enema at the same time, or being forced to watch this movie, choose the tooth pulling/enema combo.  I would rather be dipped in honey and thrown on a mound of fire ants than to have to watch this movie again. <br />I don't know what kind of drugs Berrie and Stone were on when they read this script and liked it, but it must have been good stuff.  Or maybe this is one of those things that looks good on paper.
6305064490|5.0|Director Frank Capra was a rare find indeed - a voice of optimism through some very troubled times.  Never was that optimism, along with his appreciation for his fellow man, more apparent than in this timeless movie.    Jimmy Stewart is magical as George Bailey, a man who dreams of adventure but is bound to his family business and to his adoring wife and kids.  Donna Reed also lights up the screen as Mary, the woman who stands behind George without hesitation.  George's uncle Billy, played nicely by Thomas Mitchell, has misplaced $8,000 belonging to the family Building and Loan business.  This has occurred on the day that the bank examiner has arrived for a routine inspection.  George has a nemesis in Mr. Potter (the great Lionel Barrymore), a tyranical business man who wants to see the Bailey business go away so he can make even more money. Potter has actually ended up with the missing money, but he uses that to his advantage. In desperation, George contemplates suicide, only to be 'saved' by his guardian angel, Clarence (Henry Travers).  Clarence offers George a chance to see what the world would have been like if he had never been born.    While the cast is uniformly excellent here, Stewart is the heart and soul of this film.  He is an everyman, showing both strength and weakness, desperation and joy.  This movie may strike some as sentimental.  While this is true, the sentiment is honest, and a reflection of the hope that people were looking for as WWII drew to its end.  If the rare opportunity arises, see this one in the theater.  The DVD offers a nice retrospective hosted by Happy Days star Tom Bosley.  Final grade - A+
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Hail to the King, baby. Is it Movie of the year? Read on.... <br /> <br />My reactions? I'm beguiled. Blown away. Stupefyed, even. King Kong is simply exhileratingly scintillating in every aspect possible, while retaining the brilliance of the novelty crammed 1933 smash hit. The movie was casted to utmost PERFECTION (those who are skeptical when it comes to Jack Black, well, don't worry, and even Andy Serkis make more than just cameo appearances!), no one could have executed this better than Peter Jackson. Period. It's revolting enough that this film didn't sweep the Oscars or Golden Globe Awards, let alone wasn't nominated to a satisfactory level. Yawn. <br /> <br />Anyway, from beginning to end, King Kong is an adventure that certainly is not to be missed. Sure it starts needing to get up to its eyes, but that's because it's establishing something called the vibe of the movie..... the characters, you know, character development? Some open spaces for humour that far exceeds the pathetic attempts stabbed by the LOTR trilogy, even if some parts of the film are intentionally humourous, while not quite funny IMO. <br /> <br />I think the movie opened brilliantly, with the zoo, the depression, and Ann Moss..... I was doubtful, but she just nailed down the part. As did that movie producer guy. Once they hop on that boat and begin their journey, the movie trudges in a whole different direction. A broodier direction, as not 100 percent stern the movie staves itself to be, it's actually a very ominious and frightening tale of courage, epic proportions, apprehension. Another thing is that the movie just FEELS so realistic - so gritty - and has that attribute that was also very apparent in the LOTR trilogy - it's the perfect collaboration of emotion, action, CGI digital special effects, superb acting, themes and deeper meanings, and a whole lot more, all coupled into a 3 hour film narrative. Infact, the movie cruised by so quickly that it felt more like a 2 hour movie to me.There's just so many sheerly intense, yet narly moments that are both full of chuckles and poignant shifts, many of them actually parallels to the LOTR trilogy, namely those large arachnid predators, that to Shelob, but that's just Peter Jackson being himself, 80s style grotesque stuff, y'know? <br /> <br />Oh, and did I mention that the relationship between King Kong and Ann is nothing short of extroardinary? Peter Jackson certainly knows how to convey on screen now nave, yet heartfelt monstrous creature is really, no differentiated than humanity, and the fact that humanity simply refuses to inure that other life is much closer to us than we consider in our minds. The nigher the end of the movie comes, the more you realize that it's man and their synthetic weapons of destruction that's the real monster here, not harmless (in a sense, at essence) savages and species, and the like. That's the thing though - the movie actually has a heart - a soul, something that is sorely lacking in most extravagant CGI boasting movies these days. Infact, the movie is so emotinally touching that it even caused me to shed some tears. <br /> <br />Hmm, onto the CGI digital effects. They blended it in, in a compositing sense, a lot better than they did in the trailers, probably because the Super 35mm 2:35:1 transfer was less clear, with what's probably going to be a cleaned up transfer in terms of colour rendition (also taking note of the fact that the movie was heavily digitally graded, similiar the LOTR trilogy, no such saturation was evident) MPEG-2 compression and artifacts/postersation, black/green/other colour levels, edge enhancement, and etcetra. So they weren't as cutted and pasted as I originally anticipated, and this is even more mutually beneficial and fulfilling considering the fact that CGI is integral in this movie. <br /> <br />Is the CGI digital model of King Kong the breakthough that it's been raved to be? In my opinion, no, although it's a fine digital actor that reaches a level of emotion that you can actually feel and relate to, and as the physical presence of a live, actually existing entity and a digital entity detection can be discriminated due to the sensitivity of the human eye, I'd say it's still quite easy to tell that it's CGI. The raytraced reflections in his eyes, yet the eyes alone, were done very well though, even if it's really not as groundbreaking as the Gollumn model from LOTR, or the Yoda/Grevious model from ROTS, or Harry Potter's, err, little revolutionary creature in his digital model glory that I can't remember the surname of, not that I really am all that enthralled by Harry Potter anyway. Sorry to stray off-topic there. Anyway, yes, the effects are more than just decent. <br /> <br />Speaking of the effects, it's minature speaketh time! Peter Jackson and his Wingnut/WETA digital team certainly managed to keep their flair for awesome loads of humungous, stupendous minatures, they're all over the place (in a great way, that is), on Skull Island, the ship, and so on and so forth. General cinematography is also takes a better direction this time around, Peter Jackson really knows how to direct with snazzy yet down-to-earth note style. On from the visuals, I had high hopes for the musical score to succeed as well as it would had Peter Jackson accepted Howard Shore's probably incredible effort. However, James Newton Howard still did an excellent job. I look foward to picking the score up, sooner than later, too. <br /> <br />That being said, I think that pretty much rounds up my review. King Kong is a masterpiece, folks - a fantastic film that won't, in all likelyhood, disappoint. It's definitely Movie of the Year, at least in my opinion, and quite easily rivals LOTR, not that it's really in a position to, and that both movies are quite a deviation from eachother, even if they do have a similiar feel due to being crafted by the same people. I walked into the theatre with nearly impossible expectations that Ididn't assume to be met - yet I was gobsmacked, regardless. And yes, when I say Movie of the Year, I mean better than Batman Begins, which was a fabulous flick. So do yourself a favor, and go see it. ASAP. The critics aren't mendacizing. Nor are the biased boneheads on IMDB. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />Overall Verdict: <br /> <br />Pros - Great acting, nifty story, beyond adaquate effects, magnificently thrilling moments, and an ultimately poignant adventure, and ultra-lengthy enough (3 hours and 7 minutes!!!) to fill my tastes! <br /> <br />Cons - Sometimes not funny when attempted to be, CGI could be integrated a bit better, and a bit more elaborate. And ummmm.... ummm, yeah, I'll get back to you on the rest of the cons some other time. <br /> <br />Score: 9.4/10.0
B000059Z8J|5.0|Richard Donner's 1978 Superman film was a cultural phenomenon, and with good reason.  Unintentionally following the Star Wars trend, it takes its subject seriously, which was rare for a fantasy film in the 1970's.  While Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman were the first-billed names, Christopher Reeve's thoughtful and sensitive portrayal of the Man of Steel is the reason that this movie is still fun today.  He separates Clark Kent and Superman into two distinct components of the same character.  His Clark is bumbling and unabashedly dorky; his Superman is upright, well-spoken, and kind, with a heroic, baritonal quality when he speaks.  Hackman, as the nasty Lex Luthor, has a lot of fun with his character, who was a bit more zany in the 70's, compared to the megalomaniac businessman of modern comics.  Margot Kidder does OK as Lois, although her gravelly voice grates on my nerves.  Jackie Cooper is very entertaining as Perry White, the Daily Planet's gruff editor, and Marc McClure nails Jimmy Olsen.  Ned Beatty is unnecessary as Otis, as is Valerie Perrine as Miss Tessmacher.  The film feels epic at times, helped by John Williams' brassy score.  The effects, great for the time, feel dated now, but it's still fun to watch.  Christopher Reeve was meant to play this role.  This DVD edition contains a longer cut, plus some great documentaries, screen tests, and more.  Final grade - A
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Yesterday after a lot of coaxing and grueling by my better half and friends I finally decided to go watch the supposed box office buster this year... \\"King Kong\\". But my momentary weakness did not lessen my apprehensions about the movie whatsoever. I dragged myself out of what could have been a wonderful Friday evening lazing in front of my TV into what my friends referred to as an \\"adventure of a lifetime\\". \\"Oh, the movie frenzy that can be brought about by a million dollar worth advertising campaign!\\" I thought. Well, it isn't the first time gullible people like my friends and sometimes even I (sighs) have fallen for the excessive hype created about movies even before they were released. \\"King Kong the official game of the movie!\\" I giggled to myself (like the persistent ads on TV were not enough!).  <br /> <br />So anyway, moving on...we started off really early for the show because the apparent crowd drawn by the movie would make it impossible to find the right seats to make the movie watching experience EXTRA special, or so I was told! And boy what a loss it would be to view an already huge \\"Kong\\" in the angle that would not do justice to his size! Well, fortunately (for me) we did find the right seats...\\"Thank god! Or I wouldn't have heard the end of it!\\" I said. Having arrived early (groans) gives you the wonderful opportunity to watch meaningless trivia and exciting hospital ads on a really big screen \\"Man, what a treat!\\" I thought. But it's a good tip for you late comers&#61514;. Also, it really helps you get a better perspective on to what lengths man is willing to go in order to conquer AND keep a good seat...even if that meant using every piece of your clothing to hold that seat! \\"Sigh, such singular dedication towards a really `meaningful' cause\\" I observed. Anyway, after an excruciatingly long wait and a bagful of popcorn, the movie finally commenced and silence fell upon the movie hall. \\"At least, now in the darkness of the theatre, I could take a short and a much needed nap\\" I thought. But, evidently that was not on the charts! <br /> <br />The title sequence...was to my surprise intriguing enough to grab my attention from falling asleep. The director gradually unfolds the setting of the movie in this sequence, deliberately drawing you into the early 1930s and the basic lifestyle of that time period. By clever compilation of selected movie clips that summarize the environment, people's attitude, clothing style, architecture and so on the director gives you a brief insight of New York during the time of the Great Depression. It was amazing how in such a short time he was able to transfer many levels of information to the audience. Yes, he also introduces the protagonist (or in this case Kong's one true love) Naomi Watts during this sequence, efficiently disclosing her profession and also to some extent her financial crisis. The background music for the title sequence sets a tone to the movie and is very 1930s. \\"Oh, guess it's not entirely a disaster after all\\" I thought and I was right. <br /> <br />In the movie, Naomi Watts is a struggling artist struck by poverty. She is depicted as a complex mixture of both vulnerability and courage. You find out that as a result of constant disappointments in the past she has developed a slightly pessimistic attitude towards life although she is shown to be brave enough not to stoop to prostitution driven by hunger. The director also carefully chose her attire and make-up style that give her a rather soft and tender look, I thought. <br /> <br />By now, the audience loved this sweet girl who displayed great emotional strength in such hard times. Well, I liked her too, partly because I agree that most good things tend to die off. I guess that statement in the very beginning sets the flavor and spirit for this movie.  <br /> <br />The next scene that I found extremely interesting and impressionable was where the filmmaker (in the movie) Carl Denham, was introduced. PersonallyI think that his performance was by far the most excellent and unpredictable. As the movie continues he is revealed as an overly obsessive, stubborn, eccentric, sometimes even arrogant, highly selfish and foreboding personality. The story of King Kong is a direct result of this mans singular obsession with making a documentary on the hidden Island. So, although many of you who watched the movie and totally detested the man should realize that without him, there would be no story hence no `King Kong' <br /> <br />As the movie prolonged, taking you to the part where the real adventure begins (the travel to Skull Island), in the spirit of not giving away too much to those of you who have not watched the movie as yet, I will just use one word.. HAUNTING! Although I think that the journey to the Skull Island was stretched a little bit more than necessary, I have to agree that it set a strong tone for what could be expected next i.e. a very unpleasant experience. Also the ship's crew portrays mediocre acting skills although fortunately for the director they could all depict fear quite well!! Moreover, the director's surreal cinematography in some instances of the movie adds to the mystery behind the Skull Island. <br /> <br />Now, moving to my most dreaded and favorite part of the movie i.e. the tribal at Skull Island created by the twisted imagination of some screenplay writer (shivers) and the introduction of the second protagonist of the movie...King Kong. <br /> <br />Ah King Kong, there is so much to talk about this fictional character who literally carries the burden of the second half of the movie all by himself. Although the director puts across Kong's existence as a freak of nature and a threat to human kind, his endearing personality makes it impossible to be afraid of him. It was strange to feel so attached and moved by a character that was not even real. \\"Do I actually like this movie? I pondered, but why? I thought. I have seen movies with wonderful direction, performances and special effects before, how was this movie any more significant from the other good movies? I had no answer then. As I continued to watch I gradually began to immerse myself in the movie. I couldn't help but feel connected to this being that genuinely portrayed all human emotions from loneliness to complete hopelessness. Of course all of this was made possible by the use of cutting edge 3D computer technology and had no natural bearings whatsoever, but yet it was believable. <br /> <br />That's when it occurred to me, it was not the special effects that made the creature real .I knew I was not particularly blown away by the computer animations either, which by the way were tardy in some of the scenes or the nerve wrecking `humans become dinosaur and bug food moments'. I was not dazzled by the acting either, since nobody was gratifying enough in that arena.  <br /> <br />So what was it that made my hands go numb by the end this movie? It was the STORY! The movie would have been a hit with me even if the fight sequences were less sexy or the dreamy eyed hero, Andy Serkis was replaced by the cynical Danny De Vito. For me, the story of one woman who was driven by destiny to reach an island far away just to meet the one thing she would ultimately end up losing forever was, as unfortunate as it may sound, a wonderful experience. The heart wrenching story made this giant fictional character seem `real' to me, hats off to the guy who wrote this fiction, which by far is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. King Kong is not just a creature with unbelievable physical strength but he is the epitome of what is becoming sadly scarce in our society today i.e. selfless love that does not understand nor follow the boundaries of human limitations. Watching him fall off that building in the final scene was unbelievable painful since to me it represented the death of humanity and hope in our hearts. <br /> <br />Indeed, good things always come to an end(sighs).
B00006FM77|5.0|I have the vinyl edition of this which I purchased via ebay about 2 years ago. I have been really anxious to get the CD version since I saw it was coming. Finally, I treated myself to the CD's.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to my mind is how incredibly raw this band was. I think it gave them a rock sound that I have really enjoyed far more than the 80's stuff. But, I think mainly it's Terry Kath's incredible performances on both guitar and his remarkable \\"Ray Charles-esque\\" vocals. He was absolutely brilliant in both capacities.<br /><br />Robert Lamm's vocals were always a favorite for me and I really think his level of soul here is exceptional.<br /><br />The new Chicago lineup is very good live and not to be put to the side for their quality. But, This 1971 Chicago band is one which they should look back and aim for again.<br /><br />It absolutely will blow away the competition and perhaps put them in a place creatively today that will give them a sense of true re-birth / sans nostalgia.<br /><br />I cannot stop listening to this powerful snapshot from one of my favorite bands from any era. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

I can't even begin to describe.   *His voice is also perfection.  *He's doing what he loves with great passion.

B000003TA4|5.0|In 1991, a little band called Nirvana, whose only album in release was the little known punk record Bleach, released one of the greatest, most influential albums of all time: Nevermind. Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain' held the reluctant voice of a generation, bringing a whole new style of music to the attention of the masses. Below are my scores for each individual song: <br /> <br />Smells Like Teen Spirit- 5\5: Nirvana's most famous song. Opens with a great power chord guitar riff that became the anthem for the nineties, accompanied by a fantastic scream-a-long chorus. <br /> <br />In Bloom- 5\5: Humorous and poignant, In Bloom is about the average dumb fan who doesn't understand Cobain's deep, introspective lyrics but pretends to like it anyway. The song proves to be a premonition, as thousands of Nirvana fans were later just like the one described in the song. <br /> <br />Come As You Are- 5\5: One of my favorites of theirs, it's one of Cobain's most emotional, with his powerhouse of a voice reduced almost to a whisper in certain places. A very powerful song, especially considering the band's tragic aftermath. <br /> <br />Breed- 5\5: For what's probably the only time, Kurt's voice isn't the star of the show, for instead Dave Grohl's lightning quick, pounding drumming takes center stage. One of their more punk rock songs, Cobain flexes his humorous songwriting skills some more in certain places. <br /> <br />Lithium- 5\5: Nirvana's funniest song, and their most sarcastic. A stunning contrast, however, is provided at the end when Kurt's angry howl takes over, jerking the mood from funny to angry to tragic and then, almost frightening.  <br /> <br />Polly- 5\5: My personal favorite from them, it's about a girl who was kdnapped at a concert and raped, but escaped from her captor by pretending to enjoy the torture, tricking him into letting her free. Displays Cobain's feminine views in a shocking portrait, with Krist Novoselic's dark, eerie bass lines seeping theirway into your mind. <br /> <br />Territorial Pissings- 2.5\5: The only real misstep on the album, Cobain's emotional, guttural voice just doesn't seem to have the power it does on the other songs. <br /> <br />Drain You- 4.5\5: Starts out extremely well with a very cool guitar intro that breaks into some powerhouse drumming from Grohl. Loses its intensity about halfway through, but then comes back for an amazing finish. <br /> <br />Lounge Act- 5\5: The only song on the album Cobain wrote about his ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. It starts with Kurt's voice calm and collected, until its crescendo reaches a peak in which his voice becomes a huge, wailing howl. Simply brilliant. <br /> <br />Stay Away- 4\5: Another more punk rock sounding song, very intense, but starts to get repetitive towards the end. <br /> <br />On A Plain- 5\5: A very deep, insightful song about Cobain's dark childhood and thoughts about the relationships surrounding him. These brilliant lyrics are contrasted deeply with the surprisingly upbeat, bright guitar work. One of their catchiest. <br /> <br />Something in the Way- 5\5: The most tragic song Nirvana ever performed. It's about Kurt's lifestyle as a teenager and his having to live on the street. One of the most emotional songs ever recorded in the history of music. <br /> <br />So, if you're looking for a place to start with Nirvana, be sure to pick up this one first. Not only is it them at their personal peak, but it's also undeniably the greatest album of the nineties but, in my humble opinion, the greatest album of all time.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Not often enough, a film overflows with the director's enthusiasm and glee, jam-packed with action sequences, outstanding special effects, good and bad dialogue and acting, everything, good and bad, is just completely over the top. When I see a film like this, I can tell the filmmaker is really in love with his job, because they have crafted a film with such loving detail that everything they have is on the screen.<br /><br />Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" is such a film. After watching Merian C. Cooper's original 1933 \\"King Kong\\", Jackson decided he wanted to make films. He has, reportedly, wanted to do a remake for years, but was unable to get the funding. Then \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy became an international hit and his fortunes changed.<br /><br />What he has created is an eye-popping, excessive, overly long, thoroughly entertaining adventure film with some believable romance.<br /><br />As this is his lifelong dream project, Jackson has put everything into the film. Using the 1933 film as a template, the director and his team of screenwriters have fleshed out the back-story of the characters, giving us details of their life before they reach Skull Island, making them interesting, human and believable.<br /><br />Carl Denham (Jack Black) is a filmmaker with ideas and aspirations larger than his budget. The studio wants a B-picture about the jungle and Denham wants to film an epic masterpiece on an uncharted island located on a recently discovered map. Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) is a struggling vaudeville performer. Her theater closes unexpectedly leaving her on the cold streets of New York, hungry, with no paycheck. Denham needs a lead actress, spots Ann, takes her to dinner, and convinces her to star in his movie. That evening, she meets the screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), more or less shanghaied by Denham. Ann greatly admires Driscoll's plays and would love to star in his newest production. When they arrive, Skull Island, a barren, rocky place, appears to be deserted, but the locals soon appear and believe Ann should be sacrificed to \\"Kong\\", the beast who rules beyond the giant wall the natives have built. Soon, Kong has taken Ann and the rest of the group trek through the strange island to get her back.<br /><br />At 187 minutes, \\"Kong\\" is a massive undertaking, both for filmmaker and audience. The extended length of time allows Jackson and his team to really explore the characters, helping the viewer get to know them before they arrive at the Island and all hell breaks loose. For instance, we learn the dire straits both Ann and Carl are in, prompting them to make this journey and this film. We learn why Jack, a respected playwright would become involved. All of this fleshes out the characters and helps them become more life like. When they are in danger, we care about their safety and the film becomes more memorable as a result.<br /><br />After \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, we expect the special effects work on \\"Kong\\" to be phenomenal. And it is. Later in the film, when we first see Kong, he takes our breath away. Extremely realistic in every aspect, he moves like an ape, reacts like an ape, and looks like a giant ape. If you have ever seen the 1933 film, Kong frequently changes size, in one scene he is 25 feet, later climbing up the Empire State building, he is 10 stories tall. Clearly, these special effects were advanced for the time, and the fact that they could create Kong at all is a miracle. But this wouldn't work in this day and age. Thankfully, with the advancement of special effects, \\"Kong\\" always looks the same size. He looks 25 feet tall when he first meets Ann and he looks 25 feet tall as he scales the Empire State Building.<br /><br />Just as the filmmakers have spent a lot of time fleshing out the humans, they also devote considerable screen time making Kong a real character. They give him feelings, emotions and a personality. Naturally, he is scary and intimidating, but the focus changes from terrorizing Ann to protecting her, becoming a scary adversary to all of the external forces that may appear to threaten her. In this film, we believe this change. He has believable facial expressions and interacts with the humans in natural, different ways. This may be the first time a CGI character has had a fully developed character arch. Andy Serkis, so memorable as Gollum in the \\"LOTR\\" trilogy, is largely responsible for making Kong a believable creature, giving the huge ape largely human characteristics. Simply great work.<br /><br />From the moment we first see 1933 New York, you realize you are in the hands of a master who loves to play with his toys. The city has a slightly romantic look, lights appear soft and glowing, snow rounds the hard edges, yet Jackson reminds us this is a city in the grips of the Depression. People are being evicted from their homes. The homeless have set up tent cities in the middle of Central Park. Theaters are closing. At times, the CGI backgrounds created for the film almost resemble the old fashioned painted backgrounds used in films of the 30s and 40s. I don't think this is a coincidence. I am sure Jackson did this as a homage to the films of this period.<br /><br />The entire sequence on Skull Island is filled with more special effects than any one of the \\"Jurassic Park\\" films. Kong battles some T-Rexes who want Ann for a tasty hors d'oeuvre, protecting her as he fights and rolls around with the dinosaurs. This sequence is what most filmmakers are striving for when someone describes an action sequence as \\"a roller coaster ride\\". Suprising, believable, exciting and wonderful. The rescue team has to deal with a brontosaurus stampede and, later,  insects so large you shoot them rather than swat them away. The brontosaurus stampede is equally eye popping and an equally diverting theme park attraction.<br /><br />Throughout, Jackson and his team have gone to great lengths to make every frame of celluloid believable, heightening the power of the film. Occasionally, they aren't quite successful. For instance, Kong's initial rampage through the jungle holding a screaming Ann, is not entirely convincing. The camera follows Ann, flopping back and forth, as Kong gallops through the jungle, revealing that she is clearly a computer creation. Even though these brief problems are distracting, they are also a little endearing, as though this might be another of Jackson's tributes to the original film. As much as I wish the graphics were completely believable throughout, I think the very brief lapses add a little charm to the film.<br /><br />All of the special effects work in the world will not solely create a great film. Jackson devotes a lot of time, as previously mentioned, building the back story of the human characters, making them believable, and he and partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have crafted some great dialogue throughout adding yet another dimension to what easily could be just another briefly entertaining exercise in CGI. All of this work with characters, dialogue and back story has helped to ensure his \\"Kong\\" will be king.<br /><br />Naomi Watts more than holds her own when sharing screen time with a giant ape. And she does a good job with King Kong as well. Ann Darrow is a more fully realized heroine allowing Watts more to work with. Watts gives us a first hand look as we witness Ann's struggles as an actress, to live, and to eat. There are also subtle hints at her character throughout, making her more complex and interesting than we could expect.<br /><br />Adrian Brody is also very good as Jack Driscoll, a rising playwright. Caught on the boat as it leaves, he has no choice but to make the journey. Resigned, with nowhere else to go, he sets out to write the best screenplay possible. Then he meets Ann, and falls in love. She is equally smitten, but unwilling to make the first move. Unfortunately, Jack is unable to speak the words he wants to say, pouring his heart out onthe page.<br /><br />I found the news Jack Black was cast in the film odd. Black's previous film work is filled with over the top starring roles in broad comedies. Nothing he has ever done would indicate he is capable of such a role in a film like this. Black's portrayal of Denham is interesting, over the top and inconsistent.<br /><br />Denham is an egotistical man, willing to put his film ahead of almost anything else, including the lives of a few crew members. As people in his crew are threatened, he secretly works with Preston (Colin Hanks), his assistant, to protect the film and their camera. When all hope of saving the film is lost, Denham comes up with Plan B. Black is able to adequately convey the inherent shiftiness in Denham's character, but at all times, there appears to be a joke or punch line bubbling below the surface, ready to break through. This makes the character seem less interesting, robbing Denham of some of the intensity he should have.<br /><br />Also, Black's performance doesn't have a lot of subtlety or nuance. When he realizes all chance of saving his film is lost, he shows little emotion except to stare at the exposed film. When he comes up with Plan B, to take Kong to New York, we don't see any part of his thinking, his planning, the moment when the idea pops into his head. This could be a result of Jackson's editing and direction, but Watts conveys a lot about her character whenever she is on screen, including having a relationship with a big ape. Black doesn't seem to view every moment of screen time as an opportunity to advance his character.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the occasionally corny dialogue, endearing in other actor's mouths, doesn't work well for Black. He doesn't have the skill to pull it off, making it occasionally sound like punch lines, eliciting laughs at the wrong time. Denham's famous last line loses all power because Black is unable to portray  the character's traits and pull it off. Thankfully, there is always enough going on around him to almost completely distract us from any problems with the character.<br /><br />At 187 minutes, \\"Kong\\" is a massive undertaking for the audience as well. Towards the end of the third hour, I began to wish Jackson had made two films. The first hour, as we learn about the humans, is fun and amusing. The second hour is action packed and builds a believable relationship between Ann and Kong. But this hour is so filled with amazing action that we are exhausted by the time it comes to a close. Then, when the film slows down, to reestablish New York and set-up the events for the climax, it begins to feel like we have been sitting for a long, long time. As the climax begins to build, things begin to move a bit, as Kong makes his way to the Empire State Building. In a way, Jackson is a victim of his own success; the third hour is unable to top the second. Don't get me wrong: \\"Kong\\" deserves each and every one of its 187 minutes, but it could also deserve each and every one of its 165 minutes and still be a truly exceptional film.<br /><br />Jackson's films just keep getting better and better. There are few filmmakers who could've handled the \\"LOTR\\" trilogy as well. With \\"King Kong\\", Jackson uses each and every skill, tool and artistic ability he has ever learned to create an eye-popping, excessive, overly long, thoroughly entertaining adventure film which will surely inspire a new crop of young men and women to become filmmakers.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what they create to interpret their lifelong dreams.believable, heightening the power of the film. Occasionally, they aren't quite successful. For instance, Kong's initial rampage through the jungle holding a screaming Ann, is not entirely convincing. The camera follows Ann, flopping back and forth, as Kong gallops through the jungle, revealing that she is clearly a computer creation. Even though these brief problems are distracting, they are also a little endearing, as though this might be another of Jackson's tributes to the original film. As much as I wish the graphics were completely believable throughout, I think the very brief lapses add a little charm to the film. <br /> <br />All of the special effects work in the world will not solely create a great film. Jackson devotes a lot of time, as previously mentioned, building the back story of the human characters, making them believable, and he and partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have crafted some great dialogue throughout adding yet another dimension to what easily could be just another briefly entertaining exercise in CGI. All of this work with characters, dialogue and back story has helped to ensure his \\"Kong\\" will be king. <br /> <br />Naomi Watts more than holds her own when sharing screen time with a giant ape. And she does a good job with King Kong as well. Ann Darrow is a more fully realized heroine allowing Watts more to work with. Watts gives us a first hand look as we witness Ann's struggles as an actress, to live, and to eat. There are also subtle hints at her character throughout, making her more complex and interesting than we could expect. <br /> <br />Adrian Brody is also very good as Jack Driscoll, a rising playwright. Caught on the boat as it leaves, he has no choice but to make the journey. Resigned, with nowhere else to go, he sets out to write the best screenplay possible. Then he meets Ann, and falls in love. She is equally smitten, but unwilling to make the first move. Unfortunately, Jack is unable to speak the words he wants to say, pouring his heart out on the page. <br /> <br />I found the news Jack Black was cast in the film odd. Black's previous film work is filled with over the top starring roles in broad comedies. Nothing he has ever done would indicate he is capable of such a role in a film like this. Black's portrayal of Denham is interesting, over the top and inconsistent. <br /> <br />Denham is an egotistical man, willing to put his film ahead of almost anything else, including the lives of a few crew members. As people in his crew are threatened, he secretly works with Preston (Colin Hanks), his assistant, to protect the film and their camera. When all hope of saving the film is lost, Denham comes up with Plan B. Black is able to adequately convey the inherent shiftiness in Denham's character, but at all times, there appears to be a joke or punch line bubbling below the surface, ready to break through. This makes the character seem less interesting, robbing Denham of some of the intensity he should have. <br /> <br />Also, Black's performance doesn't have a lot of subtlety or nuance. When he realizes all chance of saving his film is lost, he shows little emotion except to stare at the exposed film. When he comes up with Plan B, to take Kong to New York, we don't see any part of his thinking, his planning, the moment when the idea pops into his head. This could be a result of Jackson's editing and direction, but Watts conveys a lot about her character whenever she is on screen, including having a relationship with a big ape. Black doesn't seem to view every moment of screen time as an opportunity to advance his character. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the occasionally corny dialogue, endearing in other actor's mouths, doesn't work well for Black. He doesn't have the skill to pull it off, making it occasionally sound like punch lines, eliciting laughs at the wrong time. Denham's famous last line loses all power because Black is unable to portray  the character's traits and pull it off.Thankfully, there is always enough going on around him to almost completely distract us from any problems with the character. <br /> <br />At 187 minutes, \\"Kong\\" is a massive undertaking for the audience as well. Towards the end of the third hour, I began to wish Jackson had made two films. The first hour, as we learn about the humans, is fun and amusing. The second hour is action packed and builds a believable relationship between Ann and Kong. But this hour is so filled with amazing action that we are exhausted by the time it comes to a close. Then, when the film slows down, to reestablish New York and set-up the events for the climax, it begins to feel like we have been sitting for a long, long time. As the climax begins to build, things begin to move a bit, as Kong makes his way to the Empire State Building. In a way, Jackson is a victim of his own success; the third hour is unable to top the second. Don't get me wrong: \\"Kong\\" deserves each and every one of its 187 minutes, but it could also deserve each and every one of its 165 minutes and still be a truly exceptional film. <br /> <br />Jackson's films just keep getting better and better.

B00005JNX0|2.0|It's a shame this movie was below average. The animation was very good. Like Shark Tale, it had it's moments, but it didn't work as a movie. Dreamworks seems to have the problem to accommodate the actors with the characters instead of the other way around. Did the zebra really have to look like Chris Rock? Please.  Ben Stiller was uninspired as was Ross from FRIENDS. Again Like Shark Tale, the actors ruined the movie. The story had potential but ultimately fell flat. The only good Dreamworks production was Shrek Two.  <br /> <br />I know there is always the comparison between Dreamworks and Pixar but Pixar is by far the better company. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters, Inc. all have two things going for it: imagination & great story telling. They don't have to rely on second rate comedy to get laughs unlike Madagascar.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|Vegas' best export since the $3 buffet, the Killers have burst onto the mainstream scene with their wonderful debut album, \\"Hot Fuss.\\" Just when top 40 music started to get good again, with the emergence of bands like Coldplay and Maroon 5, the Killers have come along to join the bandwagon. While some may best know the band for their guest appearance on the cult tv show, The OC, do not think of these 4 boys from the desert as a built-for-tv band. The Killers are synthesizer-driven pop-rock, reminding me of bands like The Strokes and Bloc Party. Hot Fuss is chalked full of great songs, and the three bonus tracks that come along with this limited edition album are all great, especially \\"Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll.\\" A huge factor in buying any album is \\"Will I just skip through most of the songs and listen to the few that I already know?\\" Trust me, you will not need to do that with Hot Fuss. None of the songs are filler between radio singles. If you enjoy bands like Oasis, Strokes, and Weezer you'll definatly love \\"Hot Fuss.\\"
B00005JO1Y|4.0|King Kong is a film about a group of struggling film makers who venture to Skull Island, an uncharted land mass surrounded by mystery. Once docked, if one wants to put it that way, they find themselves up against natives, dinosaurs, and a gigantic ape named Kong who takes a fancy to the only female in the group. One man get the idea to trap Kong and take him to New York to use him for profit in a large production. Once there, the beast escapes, running loose in New York. He corners himself atop the Empire State building where he meets his demise.<br /><br />The cast is very good. None of them really stand out as being wonderful actors, but each are suited to their roles and do not detract from the film at all.<br /><br />This film is visually quite beautiful. The New York scenes, the island scenes, and the scenes on the ocean are all rather breath-taking at times. The CGI was not overused in the film and was done well so that Kong did not stand out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the cast. The giant ape is not revolutionary in this film as the original was in his film, but there has certainly been a large step forward technologically between the films.<br /><br />Peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong and made this film to pay tribute. Not only did he consult the original meticulously by contacting Fay Wray, the original Ann Darrow and by including some of the original cast and crew in this film as extras, but he added a significant amount of his own creative energy to the film. Because of this, the new version of King Kong is over 3 hours long instead of the 30s version's 110 minutes.  However, this is the downfall of the film. The beauty of classic cinema is that so much is said in such a short span of time. We all know that any film version of King Kong is going to be a spectacle; why try to add to that spectacle by bombarding the audience with more, more dinosaurs, more island scenes, more emotionalism, more everything? This only causes the film to drag on instead of flow and amaze.<br /><br />This new version of King Kong certainly stands on its own as a good film and because of the changed style of modern cinema compared to that of the original version, it seems like a completely different one. Depending on your taste, that can be either a good or a bad thing.of flow and amaze.

B00006GFAB|5.0|KISS-THE VERY BEST OF KISS: Shout it out loud kids...of the umpteen Kiss collections flooding the market, this is the closest the gruesome foursome ever came to getting it right. BLACK DIAMOND and COLD GIN aside, here's most of the band's bubble-metal chestnuts from the glory daze (STRUTTER, HARD LUCK WOMAN, CALLING DR. LOVE, ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE, DETROIT ROCK CITY), on through their disco cash-in phase (I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU), Ace Frehley's funky solo smash NEW YORK GROOVE, and the make-up challenged years of LICK IT UP. Sure, BETH is a much better power ballad than FOREVER, and GOD GAVE ROCK 'N ROLL TO YOU should have stayed in Argent's catalogue...but at least they ignored the ill-fated concept disc THE ELDER and their stinker nineties single I JUST WANNA, which ties Billy Squier's SHE GOES DOWN for dumbest sex song of that decade. This won't be KISS' last greatest hits cash-in, but they'll probably never cough up a better party platter than this one.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE MAKEUP MIRRORS
B000BB96MG|1.0|TERRIBLE.  This was the worst re-make I have ever seen.  It was billed as \\"Charlie\\" and the Chocolate Factory, which made it sound as if it was a \\"continuation\\", not a \\"re-make\\".  And, as far as I am concerned, nothing can compare to the original \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". However, I do enjoy a good re-make - but this was far from it.  The characters were WAY overdone.  The acting was terrible.  Johnny Depp has done SO much better in other movies.  He acted totally gay, and just stupid.  I like Johnny Depp in general, he has done so many wonderful movies, but whoever wrote his part in this one just ruined it.  Even in the original, Willy Wonka was NOT THAT excentric.  He was at least \\"living on the planet earth\\", unlike how this Willy Wonka was portrayed.  This new \\"version\\" of Willy Wonka went way too far, and it was just terrible.  Neither I, nor any of the 5 others with me while we watched it, would ever see it again.
0553213105|5.0|I am not one of Jane Austen's fans, not really. I love all kinds of books, but hers tend to bore me, with a glowing exception: \\"Pride and prejudice\\".<br /><br />I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't have to read it for school, I just happened to buy it based on a whim. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Thankfully, I found a book that was well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining, engaging enough to catch the attention of a 12-year-old and keep it without difficulty.<br /><br />The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England.<br /><br />The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, Jane (extremely beautiful and amiable) and the second, Elizabeth (witty but perhaps too proud).<br /><br />The dynamics of the town are changed when \\"a single man of large fortune\\", Mr. Bingley, arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy, and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how will that happen, given that Mr. Darcy is extremely conscious of his high social standing?<br /><br />Truth to be told, I liked the story, and the way in which Austen fleshed out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions. I also liked Elizabeth, and even though she was prone to mistakes, I preferred her to Jane, her extremely nice but too perfect sister. Moreover, I enjoyed reading about what sometimes happens to \\"hate at first sight\\" when time passes by, and how the main couple dealt with that, despite the fact that pride and prejudice made it difficult for them to really understand each other.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to highlight that I reread \\"Pride and prejudice\\" from time to time, and each time I am astonished by the amount of social criticism Jane Austen managed to include in what a first sight might have seemed an innocuous book. The author, who wrote \\"Pride and prejudice\\" in 1813, weaves in the story many themes that were relevant in 19th century England. Considerations of class are present throughout the book, and I think that the fact that Austen depicts so well their importance makes it easier for the modern reader to comprehend how constrictive they were. Austen also makes the attentive reader realize that the idea of marrying for love was a luxury very few women had then, as most had no other choice than to marry the first man that proposed. Elizabeth, who wanted to marry for love, was an exception rather than the rule.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Pride and prejudice\\" is the kind of book that never loses its charm, notwithstanding the age of the reader. All in all, I highly recommend this book as one that you will enjoy reading not only once, but many times. So, go for it  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcated out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions.

0446577383|1.0|After the blatant anti-American propaganda of the first couple of chapters I just had to force myself to keep reading because of Baldacci's earlier works--I figured he was creating a false platform for a twist.  But, the whole book was laughable at its often misstatement of facts, over-the-top political agenda, poor dialogue, contrivances galore, weak characters, (I mean, c'mon...a jihadist talking a comrad OUT of killing the POTUS when given the perfect opportunity--ok, let's ask them, who would NOT kill the president given a knife and no security, any hands?  Any? cricket, cricket)  This was a major disappointment because, given Baldacci's stock of prior works, I had assumed he was capable of critical, logical thought (usually a missing element for the far left)...this book is out-of-character for the author.  My own conspiracy theory is that the real Oliver Stone, with the help of Michael Moore, has threatened Baldacci, forcing him to write this garbage.  He's written it so poorly to leave us, his faithful fans, breadcrumbs to his true intent.  Or maybe in today's liberal-infested world of publishers, his editors pushed the concept down his throat.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Wow, I'm amazed to read all the reviews here. It seems like the age group is fairly low. People who like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and other giants, also like Soundgarden. That's a fact. The appreciation for great and honest music. There's a huge audience for that kind of music ranging from young to old. The majority of people who like Rage Against the Machine are young sweaty frat boys, meathead white boys who quickly jump to whatever band is poplular at the times to be in with their \\"friends\\". Yes, I like Rage Against the Machine. I think they were great. There was no other band like them, but It got OLD VERY FAST. I'm sorry to say that. When you have a guy who can't sing, you are limited in your capabilities of expanding your sound. I think that RATM made a smart move quitting before they became really annoying.  <br />Here's a history lesson for you young ones out there. Soundgarden came out in the mid 80's. They were one of the first alternative bands out there at the times. While most people were listening to Warrant, posion or whatever hair band was out there, they were making honest kick ass going against the grain kind of music. If I were to grow up in today's times and turn on the MTV VH! music channel and look for rock. WOW, what has happened. I would start to think that Green day, Nickelback were good rock bands. Its laughable.  <br />Moshing and being angry and sweaty gets old fast. You'll found out sooner or later. <br />Good album by the way!
B000BYA4JM|5.0|when i first did a search for madonna films on dvd two years ago i was shocked to see that \\"Who's That Girl?\\" wasnt on dvd- how could that be it's one of the best \\"Madonna-movies\\" along with \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" \\"Dick Tracy\\" \\"Truth or Dare\\" \\"A league of their own\\" \\"Evita\\" & \\"The next best thing\\"- yes people she can act and she is also funny!. <br />I first saw \\"Who's that girl?\\" when i was 11 or 12 & i loved Madonna's outragious character nikkie finn- \\"I am Nikki Finn, I will not be denied & I will know vengance!\\"- I loved the film  & have watched it over the years, although I didnt realise how over the top it was untill i grew up but anyway once you see it's all in the name of fun it's an absolute ball. <br />About time warner brothers! and while were on the subject what is it with studios who release dvds for films with hit soundtracks like \\"Who's that Girl?\\" who dont include the acompanying music wideo's in the special features especialy in the case of a film like \\"Who's that girl?\\" & \\"Crazy for you\\" which are sold on Madonna (& would sell a lot more copies with the music videos appealing to Madonna fans and 80's music buff's/collectors) \\"Desperately seeking susan\\" sufferd the same without \\"Into The Groove\\"- So Five Stars for the film and Four for the special features- unless the basics- the video's and trailer are included by the time it hits the shelves who knows- I've been surprised before! oh well that's what special editions are for- watch the movie, buy the soundtrack and have a ball- i know i will.

B000A88F22|4.0|I watched this whole season and loved it.  Britney is such a dork and she knows it and it is so cool to see a celebrity acting like this.   Who wants to watch someone with their nose in the air doing tons of things that we could all never dream about doing.  If you already dont like Britney Spears then dont watch this.  Or if you do, dont complain because you knew you wouldnt like it in the firts place.  But if you do like her then get it.  It is funny and cool to see someone acting real like that.  Its awesome.  And she is not a tacky redneck loser, whoever wrote that probably is.
0321200683|5.0|Deserves to take place in the great line up of GoF, POSA1, POSA2, EAA, Core Security Patterns (other \\"patterns\\" books omitted intentionally). <br /> <br />I have done Messaging and message based integration before, but this book takes essentially what is an art form and makes a science out of it. <br /> <br />First it starts with 4 different styles of integration (File based, Shared Database, RPC, Messaging) and discusses them intelligently giving their advantages and disadvantages. <br /> <br />Then it gets in to the major aspects/ pieces of Message based integration (Message, Channel, Routing, Transformation, End Points,  System Management etc). It again discusses them as patterns and develops a good vocabulary of the messaging domain. <br /> <br />Then comes the meat where for each aspect of Messaging, it gives about 8 to 15 specific patterns, names them, shows their pros and cons, gives the trade off and intelligently discusses their usage. As part of the examples it draws example from JMS/ TIBCO/ MSMQ etc. Priceless. <br /> <br />What I loved about this book is how it makes you rethink everything you may have been doing before in software architecture/ integration using technologies such as Web Services, JMS, J2EE etc. <br /> <br />For example, many would not have fully groked MDBs as \\"event driven\\", \\"competing\\", \\"transactional\\" message consumers, that are suited for \\"Point to Point\\" integration. Yes I know every body uses them but do you really understand the implications for transaction scope and threading? . Or Polling message consumers have their advantages ? <br /> <br />Good discussion on relate standards and technologies included (Web Services, Axis Implementation, WS-*, SOAP etc) <br /> <br />Buy this guys and may be enterprise integration would be less messy. <br /> <br />

B000002UA5|5.0|Lets be honest, the only reason any of us are reviewing this album is because of the all too short, but remarkable live disc.  I love Floyd just as much as the next fan, I even love the non-Waters albums, but the Ummagumma studio disc is absolute junk.  Over time I have forced myself to kind of like Gilmour's \\"Narrow Way.\\"  But therein is the problem, you shouldn't have to force yourself to enjoy music. <br />With that out of the way we can focus on the live disc.  It is by far one of the best things in Pink Floyd's catalog.  The only flaw is that is only four songs long.  (just a side note, but wouldn't it be nice if live at pompeii was also available on cd?) \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is considerably longer then the version on \\"Piper.\\"  The extra length really makes this song a sweeping epic.  Next is my personal favorite tune on the disc, \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene.\\"  The song is a completly haunting melody that builds in intensity.  Then out of nowhere Roger Waters' whispered vocals turn into this really horrifying scream that I'm sure has frightened many a listener.  It is a brilliant piece of rock theater, setting the template for later Floyd.  \\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun,\\" is longer than its studio version, and is well performed.  The closing track is the Roger Waters war epic \\"A Saucerful of Secrets.\\"  Much like Jimi Hendrix does on his classic \\"Machine Gun,\\"  Floyd tries to make the music sound like a war.  While not as powerful or successful as Hendrix's piece, the track makes for a fascinating listening experience that is superior to the studio version.  The song is a three part suite that rises into chaos and settles into a truly beautiful and mournful melody.  Gilmour's vocals at the end of the tune are classic. <br />There you have it.  Despite my three star rating I would say that this album is absolutely essential to your Pink Floyd collection for four reasons. 1.) the live disc which I can't quit raving about. 2.) the cool green slip case. 3.) the excellent album cover on the studio disc. (as an added bonus you get a little poster of that cover, cool.) and 4.) the f#@*#n' live disc.  nuff said
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I first saw the movie on its limited premiere here in NYC, initially thinking the soundtrack was good but not great (i.e. on the level of Morricone's soundtrack to Cinema Paradiso). Maybe it was my unfamiliarity with country music, or the annoying, distracting viewers immediately surrounding me...  But Mary McBride's moving on-screen performance of \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" compelled me to check out the soundtrack.  I've seen the movie again since listening to the music, and the soundtrack's definitely heightened my appreciation of the beauty of the film. Gustavo Santaollala's score is ethereal and sublime, its \\"brevity\\" making it ever more precious. By the way, he also wrote or co-wrote the country/folk lyrics sung by Emmylou Harris, Mary McBride and Teddy Thompson... truly an amazing talent!    HOWEVER, Teddy Thompson's incredibly moving, lyrical ballad \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\" was way too brief on screen and wholly washed over by the dialogue (rather, monologue) between Gyllenhaal and his incessantly motor-mouthed neighbor in the dance scene... what a shame! I'd be surprised if any viewers will even recall hearing this gorgeous piece during that scene, which only seemed to serve as an interlude of comic relief in the movie.  My vote for the best selection from the soundtrack and nearly worthy of buying it alone.    I also agree that Linda Ronstadt's song \\"It's So Easy\\" is disruptive and breaks from the unity of the soundtrack. Instead, the Allman Brothers' \\"Sweet Melissa,\\" which got more significant air time in the movie, should have taken it's place in the soundtrack.    Overall, though, a moving and beautiful soundtrack worthy of your time and money!
B00005JO1Y|4.0|I guess this movie was over hyped for me. It was King Kong. I know the story. I like the story. I liked the movie. But it didn't thrill me because I already knew everything about it.<br /><br />I thought Adrian Brody was a bore. The movie would have been just fine without him playing such an important role.
B00005JKCH|4.0|The movie Spider-man is a dream come true to the true fans of the comic series as well as a pleasant surprise to moviegoers who are looking for a decent and exciting storyline of a superhero. The storyline covers in good measured detail Peter Parker's path from high school teenage period to a hero with a burden and a matured mind. <br /> <br />\\"The story is about a girl ...\\", a great story-focus, M.J. and the pure and committed love expressed throughout by Peter Parker. Such noble and pure feelings of a introverted boy for a girl next door, old fashioned but in such a manner that proves that a love theme is always powerful and above every action packed sequence. <br /> <br />The Green Goblin character demanded more attention since such a modern Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde theme is essential to the dramatization of the story. <br /> <br />The soundtrack was exceptionally subtle and did not go for the easy musical trademark setting of the superhero. Well played out and well put through out the movie. <br /> <br />The story of Spider-Man is a modern tragedy. The character is going through a roller coaster of emotional changes due to unpredictable life turning events. Not your average superhero story. The director along with the writing team must have consciously aimed to that effect. <br /> <br />The tragedy though does not give away to an ending, because sequels need to be made, all of them welcome if properly done. The ending provides the base of Peter Parker's tragedy. The girl that he loved since he was six year old must finally be deprived of his true feelings for her. How come though? Simply, because he cherishes her life much more than his love gratification, he understands that Spider-Man can not allow any future Nemesis to hurt the people in his heart. His heart is turned to wood instead, amazing and furthermore beautifully sad how unselfish love manifests on such occasions. <br /> <br />Congratulations to all the people involved in the movie. We all hope for a great follow up that is based on the very same ethics of story telling and of course new and more developed evil characters.
B000002KO3|5.0|Remain in Light is a mind blowing excursion into funky polyrhythmic afrobeat territory courtesy of Brian Eno, producer extraordinaire and for this album a full fledged member of the group and Talking Heads chief David Byrne. There were a few clues as to the direction that the Heads took on this album. I Zimbra from their previous album Fear Of Music was a Robert Fripp driven and African influenced song that eventually became the blue print for King Crimson's amazing Discipline album. And Byrne and Eno had collaborated on the funky and sample filled experimental album My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts which had a very definite African influence. But Remain in Light went much farther than either of those two previous works in it's polyrythmic ambition, depth and strength of playing. For this album the Heads Tina Weymouth, Chris Franz, Jerry Harrison and David Byrne were augmented by Eno on vocals and keyboards (among other things), Adrian Belew (Zappa, Bowie, King Crimson) on guitar, Bernie Worrel of George Clinton's Parlifunkadeliment thang on  keyboards and others. Consequently the sound is greatly expanded from previous Talking Heads albums. It's more lush, the songs more ambitious rythmically, instrumentally and vocally, where Eno makes his presence known to great effect. This album was a true revelation, who thought that a band as artfully square, as clever as Talking Heads would put out something this dancable and funky? Perhaps not even David Byrne himself. In fact this album is so good that every album subsequent to this one was kind of a let down. Either they mined similar yet more simplified territory such as on Speaking In Tongues or tried to retrench and regain their original American oddball pop sound such as on Little Creatures or True Stories, but they never again were as successful artistically or as consistant as they were on Remain In Light.<br /><br />...The world moves and it swivels and bops<br /><br />The world moves on a womans hips<br /><br />The world moves and it bounces and hops...ves and it bounces and hops...
B00005JO1Y|1.0|There is about an hour and a half of plot yet the movie is three hours long. Half the actors can't act, Naomi Watts does a fine job at making her character 1 dimensional and uninteresting. Even the special effects get tedious, just giant stuff just keeps attacking people and that's the movie they don't even make it very exciting. You just hope the characters get killed. There's about 10 people on the ship and then the number keeps changing, people and people who get killed just randomly reappear in the film. It's terribly bad, just because Peter Jackson made it doesn't make it great.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I'm a 36-year-old \\"old school\\" (Maiden, Priest, AC/DC, OLD Metallica, etc.) metal fan and can honestly say that these guys are very worthy successors.  VERY talented across the board.  Some of the sickest drumming I've ever heard.  Maybe the singing takes some getting used to but the songs easily compensate.  Don't understand all the negative reviews.  Hasn't been out of my CD player for 2 months.  \\"Strength of the World\\" is probaby the highlight...a 9-minute+ opus that goes by way too quickly.  BUY IT...you WONT be disappointed!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|It' Summer 1963 in rural Wyoming. Two ranch hands, Ennis Del Mar (a very sexy and rugged Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (a remarkably vulnerable Jake Gyllenhaal) are looking for work when they get a gig as sheepherders on Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Ennis and Jack share hardworking days and lonely freezing nights, but most importantly, they both share a secret passion for each other that on one bitterly cold night reveals itself. They continue their summer working hard during the day and making love at night until one day Summer comes to an end and they go their separate ways.<br /><br />Four years later, they get connected again. Both are now married with children. Jack lives in Texas while Ennis remains in Wyoming. They are still in love and their yearning for each other is undeniable. However, their love affair is a burden as much as it is a bliss on both of them. They want to live out their love openly but societal laws forbidden it. They resort to frequent trysts but emotional needs cannot take it. They're between a rock a hard place and their only solace is their deep commitment and intense love for each other.<br /><br />The story of their love and how it unfolds is the story of the film, which is an absolute triumph for everyone involved in making it.<br /><br />I am very pleased, to say the least, to see two rugged, naturally masculine men romantically connected to each other in a major motion picture. Ennis and Jack's love story transcends gender and anatomy. It truly is a remarkable (and daring) achievement in American cinema!<br /><br />Ang Lee (Couching Tiger, Hidden Drago, director) did an outstanding job conveying the subtle yearning these two men had for each other. Of course, he had two very capable actors to deliver his vision, but yet it was his vision that really made this film a masterpiece. The performances were great, especially that of Heath Ledger, whom I believe should win an Academy Award for his role as Ennis. He stroke that precarious balance between detached and engulfed like no one ever could or ever will. A marvelous talent (and sexy looks to boot!)<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain, in my opinion, is a must-see for all. It's an R-rated film, so no kids allowed! This is a movie for everyone that's ever been in love with someone that for whatever reason couldn't have. It's also for everyone that knows or would like to know what true love truly is.<br /><br />Definitely one of the Best Films of 2005!ecarious balance between detached and engulfed like no one ever could or ever will.

1400032717|3.0|In the course of the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by Mark Haddon, he explains how autistic child is. Mark Haddon has written a wonderful and great novel about an autistic child. I agree with Mark Haddon by explaining how an autistic child is. By writing the curious incident of the dog in the night-time tells readers how an autistic child acts towards everyone who is around him or her. Mark Haddon writes about an outstanding fiction character and develops an amazing character's mind. Also how Mark uses prime numbers as his chapters. This is something different about the book I like. Aside from the prime numbers, he uses drawings, diagrams, and footnotes which caught my eye to read the book. As well as learning about autism and a child with autism.
0140149295|4.0|If you have seen \\"The Hurricane\\" motion picture, starring Denzel Washington (an amazing peformance), surely you'd think that you know everything there is to know about Rubin Carter. Unfortunately, that's incorrect. Furthermore, it's not even close. <br />Don't get me wrong - the motion picture is fantastic and it surely includes all the important details, but regardless to what kind of movie it is - you should know, and I can tell you that for sure because I read this book, that there are A LOT of details that aren't mentioned in the movie. <br />If you want to know the whole story I must implore you to take a long look at that book. But I should also tell you that there's a downside: The book can make you read even five pages in a row without any important or interesting thing coming up; it can also make your patience burst if you're expecting something to happen but it takes long pages, sometimes not even discribed so interestingly.  <br />Bottom line: if Rubin Carter and his amazing story interests you - I would suggest you read this book. It will make you see the big picture about this man.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I consider myself to be somewhere in between newcomers into Bob Dylan's work and his longtime fans. I first started paying close attention to his legacy of work around the turn of the century, and each step of the way I feel more and more respect for what he accomplished and his willingness to take risks and navigate against the current many times.<br /><br />The documentary \\"No Direction Home - Bob Dylan\\" by Martin Scorsese, only underscores further what a fantastic artist Dylan is. It follows him from his early days until the time right before his motorcycle accident in 1966, jumping between footage of interviews with the artist, friends, colleagues and people that knew him along the way, and live performances from his 1963-1966 period.<br /><br />Granted that the special features in the DVD set are not particularly special, the 207 minutes the 2-part documentary lasts feel like a short time, when you realize the transcendence of Dylan's work and how he broke new musical ground along the way. \\"No Direction Home\\" (a title taken from the lyrics to his classic \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\") will entertain and inform newcomers into his music and die-hard Bob Dylan fans alike, as it sheds new light on a fascinating era in our contemporary history.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|The first hour is spectacular - great effects, interesting plot, and Keanu is believable.  The second hour however slips and reminds me of \\"End of Days\\"  - plot problems and the female actress is not believable. If you liked Keanu in the Matrix, you will like this movie.  If you actually liked \\"End of Days\\" then you will love this movie.  Overall the first hour makes it worth watching, and since my expectations were low I really enjoyed it.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I have been reading so much lately from the critics about their praise for \\"King Kong\\". They say it is a movie that made them remember what it is to be a kid again. That it is a movie of pure visual joy. An escapist movie that's main purpose is to please. I think they are over doing it with the hype of that movie, but, if you were to ask me what movie do I think should be described this way, I would respond with, \\"have you seen \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\"?<br /><br /> Here is a movie that is endlessly creative. As I watched the movie I just sat back and relax while this whole new world unfolded before my eyes. I never questioned whether or not what I was seeing was possible or not because it didn't matter. \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" creates its own world. A world where anything is possible. Plus that's half the joy in watching a movie like this, or even the \\"Harry Potter\\" series. We can visit a place such as this. The world of make believe. That is what the movies are all about.<br /><br /> I've never been much of a fan of Tim Burton's work. I've always found his movies visually creative but too off beat for my taste. I have enjoyed \\"Ed Wood\\" and Edward Scissorhands\\" but everything else has left me cold. \\"Mars Attacks\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\" and the original \\"Batman\\" all have moments of visual splendor but no heart. But in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" I feel Burton has found the perfect blend. This is a movie where Burton can be as werid and creative as he wants because in this setting he can never really go overboard. Plus the movie has heart. He has found the perfect combination. That is why I think this is his best movie.<br /><br /> I've never read the book by Roald Dahl, which this film is based on, so I'm sorry to say I cannot comment on whether or not this movie is faithful or not. But, from what I've read from the critics supposedly this is. I have seen the 1971 film version with Gene Wilder though. I have always thought that movie was a bit creepy. I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but I remember certain scenes actually being scary. At least to a wimp like me. I have heard though people say this movie is creepy. Roger Ebert complained that Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka reminded him of Michael Jackson. I can sense why someone would say that, but I was never bothered by it. To be honest I was too busy being swept away by the film's visual to really care about his performance. But I never really found it creepy because again, in a movie like this you can never look at anything with a normal eye. The world created here cannot be compared to our normal existence.<br /><br /> If you honestly don't know what the movie is about it follows a young boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who wins a golden ticket when he buys a bar of wonka chocolate. With the golden ticket he, along with four other children, will be able to go inside Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and discover how Wonka's candy is made.<br /><br /> Along the way though strange these start to happen to the children. Each \\"accident\\" is of course fitting to each child's personality. One child loves to eat chocolate for example, so of course it is the chocolate that gets him in the end. Another child is spoiled and it is because of her ways she meets her own fate. \\"She's a bad nut\\", Charlie says. In this sense I've always thought the movie was a moral parable warnng children not to behave badly. I could be wrong, but that's how I've always interrupted things.<br /><br /> The only thing in the movie I don't like were the songs sung by the Oompa Loompa's (all played by the same person, Deep Roy). To me they weren't as charming or memorable as the ones in the orginal. Though four of the five songs have lyrics written by Dahl.<br /><br /> In the end though this is a minor complaint. The real star of the movie is the visual details that make up this world. Anyone looking for an escape from reality should see this movie. \\"Charlie and theChocolate Factory\\" was one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences I've had this year. Tim Burton hasn't just improved upon the original he has made his best film to date!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: An endlessly creative movie that creates a world where anything is possible. The real star of the movie is the visuals. This is Tim Burton's best movie!wing experiences I've had this year. Tim Burton hasn't just improved upon the original he has made his best film to date!     Bottom-line: An endlessly creative movie that creates a world where anything is possible.

B0002DB52M|1.0|Boring. I have to admit I wanted to like this film. I normally love experiments. But, this was an experiment that was just painful to watch. Everything about this film is pretentious, detached and it takes three times longer than it should. Yes, I get the sort of Our-Town set design. Yes, I get the conflict between self righteousness and forgiveness. Yes; I get the continuous sense of detachment. And, yes, I get that being too forgiving is not a favor. But after watching this I was left wondering why I had sacrificed three hours of my life to watch it. I still can't help thinking that with this collection of brilliant  actors, they could have done so many extraordinary things. However, they did this, instead.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|What a great CD. I can't even put into words how relaxing it is to listen to this after a long day. Just sort of puts you at ease with the world in a time when serenity is so often torn from our hands.
B000BCE918|5.0|This gift set collects the three Jurassic Park movies for a very low price. It's been awhile since I've sat down and enjoyed these films, and they hold up reasonably well. The first is the best, as it uses the initial awe and wonder to draw you into the story. The second trades awe for darkness and suspense, and works well despite the annoying environmental overtones. The third strips away all pretensions of plot from the second film and gives viewers an action-packed spectacle. All three films are entertaining in their own right, and the appearance of respectable actors helps give credibility the later films might otherwise lack.<br /><br />These discs are actually reprints of the discs released in 2001, which may still be on store shelves. The menus, video/audio, bonus features are exactly the same. Whats missing is the 4th disc of bonus features that came with the 2001 box set. It wasn't anything super-special, but Universal really could've added it here and chose not to. Also annoying is the cover flaps of the gift set box, which hang open with nothing to keep them secured. Otherwise the box is very nicely designed.<br /><br />Even without the 4th disc, this is a solid set. Those who have the films will find nothing new here, but anyone who doesn't will find a lot of fun and value.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana collects thirteen of Nirvana's best songs and adds the previously unreleased \\"You Know You're Right\\" to the beginning of the cd. While many of Nirvana's biggest fans are going to complain about this greatest hits complation, Nirvana is a good introduction to Nirvana for those of who do not want to purchase the individual albums. Most the songs that the listener would be familiar with can be found on this disc. Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come as You Are, Rape Me,& just about anyother Nirvana song you hear on the radio is here, making Nirvana the only Nirvana cd casual fans will need to purchase.
B000BJS4BM|4.0|The music itself should get near 5 stars. It's creative and different from most of music she's released in the 2000s, truly going back and connecting to her 80s dance roots. Each track has something to offer and the CD itself has a little of what made \\"American Life\\" unappealing to many; it's fun. Yes, she still has a message hidden beneath the dance roots but this is one of those Madonna records that I've been able to listen to everyday without getting tired of.<br /><br />As for the special edition, it's really nice. I don't regret buying it at all but saying that, it's not really for everyone. With such a hefty price tag, I'd expect it to come with more than just extra track. Maybe a poster would have been nice. Instead, the money seems to be put into the fancy packaging and production of the photo booklet. Steven Klein's work shines in his photos of Madonna in her now famous pink leotard outfit. There's even a nice little story to go along with the photos. The other booklet included is a diary that has the lyrics to \\"Like it or Not\\" handwritten and at times illustrated by Madonna herself throughout the bottom of the pages.<br /><br />It comes with a limited ICON membership (her fan club) but you really won't get much out of it until you become a full member. This is still a nice gift for the Madonna fan that may appreciate it. If you haven't bought the CD though and are wondering if this is for you, stick with the regular CD. You'll like it and you'll definately get your money's worth from it.
B000002UCN|5.0|Yep, George always was given short shrift.  While this collection contains some of his most memorable and well written/performed songs, it is woefully inadequate as far as length (which belies it's origins as an LP).   <br /> <br />Of note is that this is the least expensive place to get the studio version of \\"Bangladesh.\\"  All of the rest are, of course, easily found on Beatles' and other Harrison albums
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I buy a lot of soundtracks, and this one ranks up there as one of my favorites.   I have listened to it literally tens of times already. <br /> <br />I can't wait for the Season Two soundtrack to come out and I'll be watching to see what else Bear McCreary ends up doing.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith had me entranced and I think it was more because of all that has transpired between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.  I did not see this film in the movie theater.  I watched it on DVD and I could see how in the beginning of the movie, they were cold and distant from one another, as where by the end of the movie, they seemed to be very much connected.  I like to see the Director's cut.<br /><br />However, I thought the premise of the movie was cute, especially in the high speed chase on the freeway and they were having a get to know you better discussion and everything seemed all new as they were shooting at other agents.  This movie has comedy, action, adventure and romance.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn is hilarious in this film, from what I understand he did a lot of adlibbing in this film....
B000957O82|3.0|The film follows the artist formally known as the Fresh Prince (sadly D.J. Jazzy Jeff is nowhere to be found) around as the mystical Date Doctor as he helps the hapless men of New York land the girl of their dreams because as Hitch says, \\"Any guy can sweep any girl off her feet, he just needs the right broom.\\" <br /> <br />His latest client also stands to be his biggest triumph as a goofy account Albert, played by Kevin James hires Hitch to help catch the eye of the socialite, Allegra Cole, who is a client at his firm. But with about ten other accountants on her case, it's hard for Albert to stick out. Granted whenever Allegra's name was brought up I couldn't help wondering how much the filmmakers were getting paid from pharmaceutical industry. <br /> <br />But Hitch's greatest success could be in trouble when he meets a jaded woman that he tries to woo who just so happens to have a gossip column that regularly focuses on Allegra's dating life. But since this is a romantic comedy, hilarity ensues instead, or at least tries too. The movie tries a little too hard at the physical which is fine when James is on screen, but when it's left up to the Fresh Prince and Eva Mendez as the gossip maven, it sometimes fall flat. <br /> <br />Overall it was a decent movie with a couple good laughs even though most of the movie, much like every romantic comedy, was extremely predictable. There were also a few scenes that didn't really need to be in the movie like Hitch's flashback to his dorkier college days or the scene with movie killer Michael Rapaport. As for the extras on the DVD, there were a couple of run of the mil featurettes and boring deleted scenes that were rightfully left on the cutting room floor along with your typical gag reel. Also there was a video for 2005's summer anthem, Amerie's 1 Thing.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I'm not big on live cd's but I loved this, as I'm a big Alicia fan. 'Wild Horses' & 'Diary' r my favorites. <br />
B000B7BRMM|2.0|Just plain boring, and I LIKE Diana Krall. She has chosen a bunch of overplayed Christmas songs that I thought would at least be interesting to listen to her interpretation of, but that's not the case. Don't waste your time on this.
B00005U8EM|5.0|What if every moment of today is the same as that of yesterday? Some might say it is terrible and others might think it terrific. The difference happens in one's mind.<br /><br />Groundhog Day, a fantastic film, develops upon such kind of concepts. Every day is 2 Feb, everything happening is just repetition. Phil's transition of attitude of facing such circumstances is inspiring. Even if there is no tomorrow, one could still live every moment of today fully and happily. If there is no tomorrow, why not make oneself happy at each moment of the the very same day? One's attitude decides whether the repetition is happiness or sorrow.<br /><br />If there is tomorrow, the concept is still meaningful for application. Most elements of lives of every different day are the same. And how we face them is decided by ourselves.<br /><br />What an inspiring movie. I wish I could give it 10 stars for its implication, its fantastic acting and its romance and humor.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is one of the few intelligent movies out there, and probably one of only three 'intelligent' epics, the others being SPARTACUS and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.  By intelligent I'm referring to an extremely literate script, shades of gray politics within a world of black and white emotions, in this case the christians vs. muslims and vice versa.  This screenplay is extremely well-grounded in historical fact, like the other two films I mention.  Some people may have problems with this film because it is not as fast-paced as a slasher film, or as gory as GLADIATOR (which sprang from the 1960s FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE film).  Those films are predictable and also violence-ridden.  This film is dealing with the complexities of a situation where the only people who realize they are in a no-win situation, are also intelligent enough to realize they are locked into a black-and-white world they cannot control, as most people function via stark motives, hatreds, and loves.  Saladin, portrayed here so wonderfully, was really the \\"hero\\" of the Crusades, being so respected in real life, even Christians in Europe would name their babies for him.  In a sense, the Christians are the bad guys of the time period and also of this film.  Many westerners would be uncomfortable with any story that didn't have their alter-egos exemplifying the ideal.  Saladin was the most intelligent and mature of the rulers seeking to (re)claim Jerusalem as the centerpiece holy place of three religions, and he is treated respectfully and accurately, as is Baldwin of Jerusalem.  but the closer you get to the religious \\"fanatics\\", the more you can see the film as a diatribe against fanaticism, though it is against fanaticism of any kind, whether christian or muslim.  For Balian, the hero whose journey the audience is tracing, he starts off as a rather desperate young man in mourning, spiritually confused, and in need of a new foundation: he finds it in his father and in his father's devotion to the king of Jerusalem, and Balian takes this cause as his own.  But overriding all this is Balian's need for personal redemption, and much of the movie is his internal struggle as he has left the village he's known all his life, is now truly cosmopolitan, and has to adapt to everything while remaining true to his moral code, and there is some inconsistencies as there are growing pains - an affair with a future queen, but denial of marriage to her if it means the execution of her husband. All of the cast is well-suited to their roles, including Eva Green (as future queen Sibyla) and especially Orlando Bloom.  They both have the requisite look of the period as well as the talent and especially expressive features to convey the characters' thoughts and emotions.  Often the most riveting moments are when caught in close-up, either character silent in repose - they remind me of the SUNSET BOULEVARD line \\"We had faces then!\\"  These two have FACES.  They are also both striking looking in coloring, making them a good physical match on-screen.  The obligatory romance between the Balian and Sibyla characters seems to be the only hollywood movie indulgence the director took.  In conclusion, DVDs are hard to rate, because are you rating the movie or the entire package, which includes the extras?  If possible I would give 5 stars for the film itself and only 2 stars for the package, as the extras comprise only promotional background documentaries shown on the TV and internet, and the theatrical preview.  They are informative, but there are none of the television ads, nor any deleted scenes or commentary track, which seems amazing.  So, LORD OF THE RINGS still holds the crown for the most complete set of extras ever assembled (a truly exhaustive amount).

0975991477|5.0|Wanda Burch, author of SHE WHO DREAMS, [...] <br /> <br />In The Biology of Belief, Bruce Lipton simplifies complex bodies of scientific information on biological organisms and suggests paths to healing. In a wonderful melding of Einstein and quantum physics with personal discoveries in his witness of healing outside the conventional medical environment and his discovery of the universe of possibility in a single cell's life, Dr. Lipton comes to the conclusion that \\"every material structure in the universe, including you and me, radiates a unique energy signature.\\" <br /> <br />In Lipton's discussion of epigenetics - a new field of biology that is unraveling the mystery of how the environment influences the behavior of cells without changing the genetic code -  he finds that each individual cell functions as its own universe with the membrane serving a much greater purpose than originally thought. The membrane can be regarded as the security service of the cell, allowing in and keeping out what it \\"learns\\" is safe or harmful. It becomes both guardian and gateway.  <br /> <br />Lipton shows us that the cell has a kind of intellect which can be \\"taught\\" by experience and thought, making it even more important for its owner to act and react positively and in a healthful manner to the environment, to thoughts, to suggestions, and to outside energy. Genetic transfer can happen - and does - but we have the ability to influence profoundly the intellectual makeup of our cellular structure, so much so that we can influence genetics themselves and influence change in the future generations. We can also change a genetic tendency by \\"teaching\\" the individual cell what it needs to know or by altering our physical and mental environment so that the individual cells understand the kind of change they need to make - each cell its own universe but with the ability to then teach the cells around it.  <br /> <br />I am reminded of a big dream in my own healing journey in which I useddream imagery as adjunct therapy to medical treatment for breast cancer.. In that dream, I saw two \\"cities,\\" one in ruins. As people worked to rebuild the ruined city, a second city, which lay across a bridge, magically rebuilt itself, only better than the first. Every positive influence exerted in the ruined city exacted a more perfect city across the bridge. There were mysterious cubes in the dream, keys to the cubes, and guardians as well as builders. I called my dream \\"Cell City\\" and felt there was an important lesson about the influence of thought and human ability to not only heal but to influence the rebuilding of the body's cells in magnificent ways. I found myself re-exploring that dream as I read The Biology of Belief.  <br />I recommend Dr. Lipton's simple, direct exploration of research that may provide a bridge for other scientists and certainly provides an invitation for all of us to take responsibility in making connections that will bring health to ourselves and to our environment. He charges us to expand our role in influencing and being influenced by the universe and in the melding of psychology, biology, and spirituality. <br /> <br />© Wanda Burch 2005.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Although the majority of fans and critiques say the opposite, I would have to say that this is one of the best Radiohead albums. For me, this is tied with OK Computer as my second favorite album by them. It owns the Bends (though not by much, and completely puts Amnesiac and Pablo Honey to shame. I see this album as an amalgamation of the more electric side of Radiohead with the rock side of them. Songs like 2+2=5 show that they can still bring the rock while songs like Sit Down Stand Up hark back to Idioteque and the like. <br /> <br />Highlights: Everything but the Gloaming.

0316096199|5.0|I loved this book, it was so amazing, inspiring and extremely hard to stop reading. Her story of her rape in her freshman year of college and life in the aftermath of it is written in such vivid, descriptive language that is both raw and harsh but beautiful at the same time. She struggles in her relationships with her family members, friends and men. Sebolds writing is so real that I felt that I was experiencing it myself and at times the reality of it made it painful to read. Anyone who liked the Lovely Bones, also by Alice Sebold, will love Lucky and vice versa. However, I personally enjoyed Lucky much more. The writing in Lucky is so personal and heartfelt and she really sends the message that you have to stand up for yourself in order to survive.

B00004RFFS|5.0|The cruel torture of a group of vampires condemned to live forever in the shadows, at the eve of every shinning day, the absence of center mythically speaking and all its misfortunes and miseries are magnificently expressed through a solid script, that combined  tragic solemnity and serious reflections around such distorted argument through questionable deformed stereotypes.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I have never ever had a spanish album before, I can understand the language and when I first heard this CD i thought it was great, it sounded much more superior compared to Laundry Service (her previous studio release) and I loved it. The first single \\"La Tortura\\"was a huge hit and was a stand out on this record, I would think that would be the only song I would listen to on this cD, the bottom line is, it was...for about 2 weeks. Then I discovered the rest and I loved it! there are only 2 songs i didnt like:<br /><br />Escondite Ingles<br /><br />Lo Imprescindible<br /><br />all the rest is great!<br /><br />I love La Pared and the acoustic version included on this album surpasses the original!<br /><br />Even though I havent heard her previous spanish albums, I know that her spanish albums will always be better compared to her english. Im not totally bashing her english efforts, I love them too, but Fijacion Oral Volume I is just that little bit better than Oral Fixation Volume II.<br /><br />I highly reccomend to any of those who are just curious about the album, or can speak spanish to totally check it out, If it dosent impress you, La Tortura should be just enough to do so!<br /><br />\\"La Vida es un collecion de recuerdos\\"
B00003CXA2|5.0|This film is a denunciation of generational excess.  The film spotlights some of the traumatic disasters and cultural phenomenon, the curious history of the 60's and 70\\"s, a watershed for boomer youth; God help us; it has marked us all.    I guess if your top button is buttoned and your pants are hitched up, and if your hair is cut severely, then you have the Tom Hanks look for a Southern fellow that's mentally deficient, though he can run fast enough.  I agree with other reviewers, it's a Tom Hanks career highlight.  He is the good-hearted bumpkin that bumbles his way with honor.  The plot juxtapositions Hanks solid, folksy morals versus raw evil or angry ambiguity.  He knows there is his mother and there is a God.  That is powerful life-fulfilling fuel.      In contrast, Forrest's childhood friend Jenny is lost.  Robin Wright plays the sexually abused cracker's daughter.  She's plenty smart and is perceptive enough to realize that Gump is a sweet friend, loyal.  However, she's on the run most of her life, drugs and 60's rock and roll and then LA and disco coke parties.  Naturally, after each of her prodigal returns to Forrest, she loves him physically, but she cannot love spiritually.  She does not find peace till she exorcises her lifestyle demons, seeking comfort in Forrest's arms; then there's the bittersweet finale.    To booster my theory, Gary Sinese as Gump's Vietnam Lt, loses his legs in battle.  Gump wins the Medal of Honor by saving his platoon and Sinese too.  Lt. Dan is from a military family and is bitter that he has lost his legs rather than dying heroically.  Again and again, Sinese's post-Vietnam life is in turmoil as he is flabbergasted by Gump's successes.  The good Lt.is bitter in his cups.  Later in the shrimp boat storm scene, Sinese finds the Secular Hollywood God; literally he is baptized.  (Does Sinese really have legs or not.  Amazing special effect or they used an actor with stumps.  Ya got me?)    Yes, there is a religious message:we areruled by destiny and we float in the air like a feather simultaneously,an obvious Christian message that is never spoken as the PC crowd grapples with eternity.
B000002UY5|5.0|I bought this cd when No Rain was playing on all the radio stations and the video was on regular rotation on MTV back in 92.  I listened to it alot back then but somehow over the years I stopped listening to it.  I was in my friends car the other day and I liked the music he was playing and it sounded somewhat familiar so I asked who it was, obviously he said Blind Melon.  I remembered that I have the cd so I decided to give it a listen again now that I am older and I think I like it more than when I first purchased it.  Excellent album throughout the whole cd.  Mix of classic rock, country, bluegrass, and jam-band.  Great album to add to your collection.
B00005I44H|5.0|Murray Perahia's musical integrity is unquestionable. Every time you listen this admirable pianist you feel the astonishing clarity of his impeccable phrasing as the final result of a conviction, a long journey that began in his soul and finished in his hands.<br /><br />There are just a few pianists in the world who still maintain a musical thought (that has became an authentic rareness) far beyond the astonishing technique and refinement. Perahia playing is ambitious; that 's why he sounds so interesting and ever challenging the traditional canons.<br /><br />In 2006 I really hope Perahia will record again Mozart 's  Complete Piano works. So keep in mind this formidable artist of the piano.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Ok, so I have listened to both albums and I have to say they are both good.<br /><br />The english versions of \\"en tus pupilas\\" and \\"Dia Especial\\"are just weird when I hear them I cant help but sing along to them in spanish. But also the bottom fact is that both albums have there fair share of dumb tracks<br /><br />Fijacion Oral, Vol 1 : The Dumb Tracks:<br /><br />Escondite Ingles<br /><br />Lo Imprescindible<br /><br />Oral Fixation, Vol 2: The dumb tracks:<br /><br />Hey You<br /><br />Timor<br /><br />I love all the other tracks<br /><br />Yeah sure, the new album dosent have the flare that Whenever, wherever made Laundry Service such a big hit but the bottom line is that it is cool. Her songs that are from spanish to english arent very good but they are still worth a listen and good to present to those who havent heard Fijacion Oral Vol 1.<br /><br />Get This album NOW! and while you do pick up FIJACION ORAL, VOL 1! If Laundry Service put you off, dont worry! This is MUCH better!<br /><br />Go now!!!<br /><br />\\" Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich\\"
B000H30B2C|5.0|REVIEW: When Peter Jackson brought his idea of King Kong to the movie studios back in 1996 he was quickly denied it. So, in the mean time he did three small films, you may have heard of them, they were about some ring or something like that. Universal came back to Jackson and said that if he still wanted to do it that he could. The result is one of the most awe inspiring films of all time. It's seriously hard to describe the scope of a film like this version of King Kong. We all know the story, I mean the script is 72 years old. Carl Denham, an eccentric filmmaker, is about to be finished because his producers are fed up with his recent flops. He decides that he's going to make a grand epic by exploring the uncharted and mythical Skull Island. He lures Vaudville actress, Ann Darrow who is reduced to stealing food because she can't find work. Jackson creates the perfect atmosphere of an America during the depression and we get this sense of desperation on both Denham's and Ann's part. On the boat Ann meets Jack Driscoll, her favorite playwright who is writing Denham's screenplay. They find Skull Island unexpectedly in the fog and in an incredible scene the ship tries to maneuver from the jagged rocks of the island wall. Once on shore the characters encounter the natives who kidnap Ann and give her as human sacrifice to Kong, who lives on the other side of a massive wall.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place on the island as the entire group tries to rescue Ann. The island has an atmosphere that is just undescribable. It's absolutely wonderous, and the scale is just immense. The brontosaurus stampede through the canyon is incredible. The visual effects are amazing in the film, and Jackson seamlessly blends visuals with sets to make it work. Later on Kong protects Ann as she tries to escape three Tyrannosauruses. The sequence is breathtaking, and you will watch with your jaw dropped as these giant beasts fight to the death. Another sequence is the spider pit scene, which was not in the original but is reportedly a lost scene. It never made it into the final cut of the 1933 version, but it is here in full glory. The most vile insects imaginable blown up to a huge scale will make you cringe into your seat. Everything is done to the extreme, but not to a point where the audience says \\"oh that's impossible, that would never happen\\", well maybe it's impossible but it's fantasy, so lighten up. Nothing is too extreme to a point of implausibility. The greatest thing about this version is the emotion, the connection between Kong and Ann that was hard to absorb from the original. We see a connection of two souls, a lonely beast who is the last of his kind, and a women who has been thrown out on the street. It's a love for one another's presence and Jackson handled that with expertise.<br /><br />The film has a shift in tone once we leave Skull Island, and Kong is captured and brought back to New York. We go from this incredible land of mystery to the city where Kong is put on display. Carl Denham has saved himself and thinks he is back on the top, which is all he cares about. Once Kong escapes and rampages through New York City looking for Ann we start an emotional ride all the way to the end. The moment Ann and Kong ascend the Empire State Building you start to anticipate the inevitable end. You watch as Kong basically climbs to his doom just to spend one last sunrise alone with Ann. After a poignant scene at the top there is the shot of the biplanes coming in from behind the building and it sends unnerving chills down your spine. The film's climax is stunning, one of the grandest most iconic scenes of cinematic history recreated through the mind of a master. James Newton Howard's score adds an emotional boost to Peter Jackson's poignant and epic vision. The movie is more than a visual effects romp, it is a truly beautiful story expressed in such a way that it will leave a grand mark on you as a movie goer. This new version has 13 minutes of restored footage, mostly stuff that is a homage to the original like the underwater escape off of the rafts.<br /><br />Jack Black plays the overly eccentric Carl Denham with perfection. His reaction, as he stands in the auditorium after Kong escapes into the city, sends a message that this character has basically brought upon is own demise. Naomi Watts plays her role mostly through screaming and through facial expressions, and she does a fantastic job interacting with a character who was digitally added in later. Andy Serkis did the motion capture for Kong, just as he did the acting for Gollum. His facial expressions and body movements give Kong a human presence, and it helps with the emotional connection of the two characters. Jackson even gave Serkis a side role in the film as Lumpy the cook, which I thought was great too. Adrien Brody plays Jack, who I think never comes to realize the connection Ann has with Kong and he feels distant from the audience as a character.<br /><br />VIDEO: King Kong looks absolutely stunning. This new version is pretty much the same transfer as the previous release. King Kong is a film with some sort of special effect in nearly every shot, so this transfer needs to look great. Color tones are right on the money, black levels are handled well, and the picture is overall incredibly sharp.<br /><br />AUDIO: The sound is again Dolby Digital 5.1, and some are asking \\"where is the DTS?\\". While this film would have been spectacular with DTS the Dolby Digital is only a hair behind. Simply, the sound is explosive and dynamic. Ambient noise is effectively spread across all channels to envelope you. The canyon stampede is probably the best sounding scene in the film. Don't dwell on the fact that there is no DTS, the Dolby track is very impressive.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES: The special features are spread across all three discs. The first thing you'll find is the great commentary by Peter Jackson, which is incredibly informative and on par with the Lord Of The Rings commentaries. The next thing on the set are the deleted scenes, and there are a whole lot of deleted scenes. The visuals are unfinished, but it's interested to see what was left out of the already 3.5 hour extended edition. Next on disc 1 is the blooper reel, and this is probably one the best blooper reels I've seen on a DVD. It's pretty long and incredibly funny, and it just shows that Jack Black is funny no matter where he is. On disc 1 there is also a hidden featurette that is extremely funny, it's not hard to find at all. Moving on to disc 2 we have the incredible making of documentary. You can watch the whole thing together, or in the separate segments. There is an introduction by Peter Jackson and he explains that nothing here is repeated from the Production Diaries or the previous DVD. There is some really interesting stuff here, and all film students or film buffs need to watch it. The entire filmmaking process is shown in great detail from pre-production to post. There is also a featurette on recreating Skull Island and how the filmmakers wanted it to make it look like the same Skull Island from the original version. There are also a bunch of animated pre-visuals (basically takes the place of storyboards), and a video gallery which shows the concept drawings in montage form. Finally, you can load the third disc into your DVD drive and view the original 1996 script that Jackson cooked up just have it shot down by Universal, then you can compare it with the final version for the 2005 version. An amazing supplement of features is topped off with three trailers.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"It wasn't the airplanes, it was Beauty killed the beast.\\" When our generation watches the original King Kong we see a clay gorilla walking on miniature sets. When Peter Jackson watches the original King Kong he sees everything that we see in his film today. Every filmmaker has their one source of inspiration, and King Kong was his. I'm glad he shared it with us. We go to the theater for films like this and even though it is the second remake of this story, Peter Jackson has brought this film a new life and made it his film. It is truly a wonderful, exciting, heartfelt, and touching homage made for modern times.ative and on par with the Lord Of The Rings commentaries.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|What do you get when you have an actor who can't act, a director who can't direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it? You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy.  The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Out Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performances that this film really did not deserved. Other than Weisz and Stormare, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie.
B00008R9KF|5.0|Stephen Frears paid a felt tribute in Fassbinder' s memory through this picture. This launderette is an authentic micro cosmos that allowed to join two well opposite personalities so different in attitudes and particular ambitions.<br /><br />Somehow S.F. continues exploring the advanced roads initiated by his predecessor; and even Frears lacks of the human touch that became a true landmark in Rainer, he achieves a mature film that focuses and handles the complex ambiguity of this couple in London.
B000AL730O|4.0|I may be fourteen, but the Beatles are my all-time favorite band, and Paul McCartney is my favorite Beatle. Needless to say, when I heard that he had a new album coming out, I was pumped and wanted to get it immediately. I heard a clip from \\"Fine Line\\" off of [...], and I loved it. That particular song kind of has a \\"Lady Madonna\\" ring to it, I'd say. Soon after \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" came out, I had it.    Amazing. Absolute musical genius. He's done it again. These songs may not be as classic as \\"Live and Let Die\\", or the invincible anthem \\"Band on the Run\\", but they are still very Paul-esque, and very musically stellar.    \\"Fine Line\\" is kind of reminiscient of the Beatles. It reminded me of \\"Lady Madonna\\" the first time I heard it. \\"How Kind of You\\" isn't great, but it's okay. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a lot like \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", making it very good. \\"At the Mercy\\" isn't anything special, but I like it. \\"Friends to Go\\" is one of the best. Kind of...\\"Get Back\\"-ish, but not really. \\"English Tea\\" is amazing, and sounds quite British. \\"Too Much Rain\\" is another quality tune. I don't like any of the others except for \\"Anyway\\"...great melody.    I'd give it five stars if I liked more of the songs, but those are the best. Enjoy the tunes.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I just bought this album this last weekend and have listened to it a number of times since.  It is absolutely fantastic.  As other reviewers have noted here, this is the perfect single disk collection of his work.  I have a random mix of a couple of his albums plus some \\"greatest hits\\" disks, but none have come close to this one in encompassing his career and giving you nearly every track you would probably be looking for.    If you are a pretty serious Johnny Cash fan, then you almost certainly have all of these songs, so this disk may not be a \\"must have\\" for you.  If, however, you are like me, a casual fan looking for a solid collection of his hits, then this is most definitely the one for you.  Pick it up, you will not be disappointed.
B00003CXBK|3.0|While Princess Mononoke was in itself a very well done movie the English dubbing is well...how do I put this...terrible.  People should learn that using real life actors in voice over talent is a recipe for disaster.  Billy Bob Thornton comes off as being a flat and emotionless persona in the movie.  While Claire Danes and Minnie Driver do carry out their roles admirably they are far from the grade of talent that exists for this kind of work.  In relation to the gore of the movie I must say that this criticism is ill founded.  I mean to say when one gets his/her arm cut off or their head for that matter and their is absolutely no blood there is an issue.  In short turn off the English dub and watch it in the original Japanese for a better experience.
B000BNI90O|5.0|such a great soundtrack! it's fun to hear the music without the dialogue in the background, yet still knowing what part of the movie the music is from.  if you really liked the movies, or just enjoy listening to very well written orchestral music, this is for you. 100% enjoyable!
B00004XPPE|5.0|A coldwar epic, coldly realistic whereas Dr. Strangelove was surreal and ironic. I can't add anything to what the others have apready said except that if you are a military aviation fan the film contains a rare loop of a Convair B-58 \\"Hustler\\" taking off. I guess its supposed to depict the 6 bombers that are the subject of the emergency in the film but its a loop of the same plane. Too bad  the Air Force wasn't more forthcoming with footage of this beutiful plane.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|First, people need to understand it is not Mariah releasing the albums, it is IDJ, so stop blaming her. Also, most people who already own the album are not going to buy it again, rather they will buy the singles individually. These re-releases are directed at those who do not have the album. <br /> <br />This is an amazing album and the new additions add a lot and is a big improvement over the regular TEOM. So Lonely (One and Only Part II) and Makin' It Last All Night are two great songs. Although Mariah's voice has tightened over the years, not as good as it was in the past, this album has several outstanding songs which Mariah can still proudly boast and show off her still-great voice. Songs like Mine Again, Fly Like a Bird, Joyride are some of her best songs to date. We Belong Together, her biggest single to date, shows her talent as not only a singer but also a songwriter. People should stop writing random \\"Mariah Sucks\\" comments. Mariah is very talented and has changed over the years. If you don't like her new stuff, tough, but say so. Don't just write \\"this sucks\\" and diss the artist. <br /> <br />If you do not yet have Emancipation, this edition is the best. Mariah deserved the 8 Grammy Nominations and this is possibly the best album of 2005.
B00000099Y|5.0|tool is amazing, and this has been a favorite album of mine for years. go listen to that pop crap you're so into these days.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie is SCAREY! I saw this a couple of months ago, thinking it was a good Halloween horror picture that would be a lot of fun to watch. I was WRONG! I didn't sleep all night after I watched the film because I was so terrified. It was a great movie, but very TERRIFYING!  <br /> <br />Emily Rose is a college student who gets possessed by a demon. Unfortunately she dies and her priest is charged with her murder.  <br /> <br />This film makes the original Exorcism movie with Linda Blair look like the Muppets Take Manhattan. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is NOT for the faint of heart and I do not recommend it for children. I have never gotten so scared from a movie in my entire life, and I have seen plenty horror pictures.
B000000OTU|1.0|Awful CD. Aerosmith are one of the most overplayed and overrated <br />rock bands of all time behind the even worse, AC/DC. The singer <br />just screams, this isn't music, this is just noise. I mean the <br />only good song is Janie's Got a Gun, everyelse spit. This music <br />is trash, throw it away and don't buy it again.  <br /> <br />Get Your Wings is all you need from this overrated band.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine recently devoted a special issue to the top 500 albums of all time, and Revolver was Number One. Its no surprise- Revolver truly is an incredible album, both conceptually as well as in individual songs. In colleges across the country, the Beatles have made a fierce comeback and are one of the most listened to and widely loved bands around, and revolver is at the top of most people's list as one of if not the best album. <br />You must own this album!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Great album, better than anything AC/DC ever did. Billie Joe <br />Armstrong doesn't scream, this is more music, not noise. Avoid <br />AC/DC if you can. This is good heavy metal.
B00000JFV9|5.0|I love the songs. Raw music of the 70s. To think I was only a kid back then and these songs impregnated in my mind and heart. I love Curtis Mayfield. A must own CD for any music lover.
B000002KET|5.0|There is so much to say about this CD, there isn't enough words to describe it. Beside the grungy guitar Black Sabbath are highly noted for, there is something called melody. The two combined have created a brilliant sound. Though the production was a little shoddy, it adds to the flavor, and mood of the recording. Here is an overall review of each song <br /> <br />SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH  9/10 <br />A NATIONAL ACROBAT     10/10 <br />FLUFF                   4/10 <br />SABBRA CADABRA          9/10 <br />KILLING YOURSELF TO LIVE 8/10 <br />WHO ARE YOU?           10/10 <br />LOOKING FOR TODAY        8/10 <br />SPIRAL ARCHITECT         9/10 <br /> <br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath does not dissapoint. My personal opinion, it is an essential, classic metal masterpiece. <br />You won't waste your money.
B00005JOFO|5.0|It's funny to me that on the cusp of the year 2006, there are those who still feel the need to water down the point of this movie in order to make it more palatable to the general movie-going public.<br /><br />This IS a gay movie, and it's about time.  Having sat through hundreds of variations on My Best Friend's Wedding or some other 'chick flick' with both straight female friends and gay male friends, I can honestly say that this film has been a lifetime in coming for me.  I suppose that if you're not a gay man you can't relate to this very important point, but after a lifetime of having to rewrite hundreds of movies in my head after leaving the theater to dream what it would be like to see a movie about love between two men, especially one starring two headlining straight men, it is a seminal moment.<br /><br />This is not a chick flick; there are no dashing leading men and there is no clearly defined happily-ever-after.. but what there IS is the indelible impression of the hell-and-back reality that many thousands of gay men have gone through while traveling the slow road to acceptance.  40+ years after the story in this movie started, the journey continues.  The making and the success of this movie, in my opinion, is one of the milestones on that road.<br /><br />I've never quite felt like I felt when I left the theater after seeing this movie, but I am so thankful that it was made, that it was made WELL, and that if only one non-gay person out there has the lightbulb moment that we love and lose and love again just like everyone else, it will serve more than as just a greaet cinematic experience but one that opens the eyes and the hearts of others.
B00005JKN9|2.0|Although the production values are excellent (the set decorations, costumes, and period music) and the story historically accurate(immigrants clawing for a place in society, the 1863 Draft Riots, the north's own prejudice to non-whites), \\"Gangs of New York\\" is an utter failure at entertainment. Scorcese seems to think non-stop violence is the best way to hold an audience's attention span for 167 minutes. Packed with gore, torture, and scenes of battle, this film is only for those with a strong stomach. I went eagerly to this movie as an armchair historian and Civil War buff but had to force myself to watch it and came away utterly repulsed. I can't even recommend it for historical value. Two stars only.
B0002B76OK|4.0|Most rate 'dance of the lemmings' as there best, but this is much more consistent. Any album that has the majestic 'archangels thunderbirds' three minutes of perfect West Coast physc/rock with great female vocals from Renate is worth the price of admission. Whereas 'Lemmings' was heavily influenced by Pink Floyd/Jefferson airplane 'Yeti' is much more representative of Amon Duul's roots, that is lengthy tracks with lots of improvisations and spacy interludes. There is a stunning 18 minute improvisation with an incredible build up and when the whole band enter it is breathtaking. The suite on side two is obviously the stand point and the phasing is effective, not to obtrusive like most albums of the time. On the downside the improvisations 'yeti talks to yogi' and flute driven 'sandoz in the rain' outstay their welcome, but this shows that in 1970 German rock was just as exciting as their USA and U.K counterpoints and often (as with Can) much more influential. Up to 'Wolf City' the band could do no wrong. After that my advice is tread carefully.
B00005B36H|5.0|Wow, what a great album. I know it's been out since 2001, but I never really got the time to understand the whole meaning behind it. It is a terrific album with both soft and aggressive sides, which is what I really like about Tool. If I ever am agnry, I'll put Ticks and Leeches on, or if I'm just relaxing Disposition is a good song. Anyway if you are a Tool fan, or just want a solid rock album, definitely pick this up. They deserve the credit.     I also laugh when people say, \\"Now look at bands like Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park. That's real music.\\" People have no clue what they're talking about and they're trying to get some sort of recognition in their life by posting it in a review. Some people just don't understand the complexity behind Tool.    The Grudge - 9/10 - Begins with some sort of generator powering up. When it kicks in, you'll be hooked. Hard drumming and a good bass line. It's an angry song, but it fills the needs to exceed to be a solid opener. The middle is like the beginning, it swithces on and off. The best part is the ending because it's an all out grunge fest. It releases what it kept in the beginning and lets it all go. Great song.    Eon Blue Apocalypse - 5/10 - Just a bunch of guitar picking. It would be better if it was longer, but it just acts as an intro to The Patient. The only part I like in this song is the end, because it sounds like it would be a good intro for Schism. Anyway, lets move on.    The Patient - 9/10 - Cool guitar in the beginning, but it almost sounds af it was a techno song. The beginning is a little slow. It might take a while to get into, but it's worth it. Really good song if you take it into consideration. Once again, another song I like near the end. It's where I feel the song really gains it potential.    Mantra - 6/10 - I gave it a 6, because it's a very creepy song. It's not even a song. When you first hear it, you're wondering what is that weird noise. It's said that it's Maynard's Siamese cat being squeezed and made into some electronic voice. You'll have to hear it for yourself.    Schism - 10/10 - Took me a while to get into. When I first heard it, I hated it. But was I wrong. Possibly the \\"hit\\" on the album. Without a voice in the chorus, and after three verses it changes into a different part of the song. Another song that lashes out at the end.     Parabol - 8/10 - I thought it was cool how they split these songs apart. This doesn't have much umph, but it serves as an intro. It's like a totally different Parabola, but with the same lyrics. Nothing really special, but then it feeds into the next masterpiece.    Parabola - 11/10 - I might call this Tool's most outgoing song. Most of their songs are dark and slow, and this one just seems like its got a good side to it. I never could see Tool doing this kind of style. It almost sounds like an APC song. A big highlight on this album.    Ticks and Leeches - 9/10 - Now we come to the angry sond. Definintely angry. It is said they rarely play this live because it's so much work on Maynard's vocal work. From the title it's clear that's its an angry song. Really fascinating guitar and fast drumming by Danny. I don't think Tool has ever done a song this crazy    Lateralus - 10/10 - Once again we have another highlight. The self titled track is another masterpiece. Starts off slow, but it slowly kicks in. So your not leaving empty handed. Beginning almost sounds like EBA. The same drum work sounds like Ticks and Leeches a bit.     Disposition - 8/10 - I personally think this is a great song to relax to. 4 minutes and barely any lyrics at all. It's calm, so don't expect much. The next 2 tracks, all were made to be one song. But when Disposition ends it sounds a little something like...    Reflection - 10/10 - Cool drumming in the beginning, well actually throughout the whole song. It's hard to describe the tone of the song. Kind of a space/Arabian effect. Not a song for everyone but I think it's fits me well.    Triad - 9/10 - Deserves a 10, but there is just silence at the end. This is pretty much every song wrapped into one. It's instrumental and a great rock song. Intro drags a bit and the riffs are repetitive but it's what you think.    Faaip De Oaid - 6/10 - Don't ask what the title means, but it sounds like an officer from Area 51 giving some report in the background. It is heavy static effects and there is random drumming in the back. Kind of dull closer.    Really impressed. A must have. 5 Stars!
B000059LGC|4.0|This second outing by John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin is no where near their first, Murder on the Orient Express.  But it is still a great mystery.  The style of the movie is identical to the first, prelude followed by gathering of the cast, then a murder or two and finally a gathering of suspects and unmasking of the killer(s).  The only difference is Albert Finney did not want to reprise his fabulous interpretation of Hercule Poirot, instead they have Peter Ustinov.  Ustinov makes a very good Poirot and needs little change physically.  Ustinov would recreate this role in two more feature films and four more television adaptions. <br /> <br />As the film starts we meet heiress Lynette Ridgeway (Lois Chiles).  Her best friend Jackie De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) is engaged to Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale).  Lynette gives Simon a job at her estate and ends up marrying him!  They decide to honeymoon in Egypt and a steamer up the Nile.   <br /> <br />Now we assemble the suspects.  We meet Andrew Pennington, Lynette's trustee (George Kennedy), who has embezzled from her and needs to cover it up.  This is followed by Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) and her paid companion Bowers (Maggie Smith) whose father was ruined by Lynette's family.  Mrs. Van Schuyler has a fascination of Lynette's pearls. And of course the perfect honeymoon guest, the jilted lover, Jackie.  Of course, Poirot needs an assistant Colonel Race (David Niven).  Also on board is Lynette's maid Louise (Jane Birkin), anarchist Mr. Ferguson (Jon Finch), Dr. Ludwig Besser (Jack Warden) whose clinic Lynette is trying to shut down, novelist Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury) who was being sued by Lynette and her daughter Rosalie (Olivia Hussey). <br /> <br />The plot is fairly typical Christie, murder attempt, red herrings, murder, additional murders and the solving of the murder. <br /> <br />As usual, the plot is overly complex but all the clues are right there in front of you.  This is deliciously fun.The stand outs are Angela Lansbury and Maggie Smith.  Lansbury is over the top as the over the top potboiler writer.  This lead to her much more subdued turn as Christie's other main stream sleuth, Miss Marple.  Which lead to the role that made her a household name, Murder, She Wrote's Jessica Fletcher.   <br /> <br />Maggie Smith is perfect as Bette Davis' bitchy paid companion.  It is not often that Bette Davis got upstaged in films.  In this one, Smith just runs over her with her perfectly time quips. Smith won the Oscar that year for California Suite but I think this was much better. <br /> <br />Orient Express was the perfect murder mystery move.  Death on the Nile is a deliciously fun mystery. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|There are just not enough good things to say about this movie.  Yes, there are some plot quirks that are a little distracting, but on the whole it is just what the 'doctor' ordered.  And Kaylee's (Jewel Staite) lines are HYSTERICAL!!  No spoilers here; you'll have to see it yourself. <br /> <br />Don't swallow a bug.  See this movie.
B0007GAERG|1.0|i'm not a mariah fan, ok, but when you listen to a record of a singer you don't like, all you expect is find good reasons to start appreciating them. it happened to me with the u2, sting, even britney or christina aguilera. but not with mariah. the strength of the voice is not everything (see other great singers who have \\"normal\\" voices but great creativity and charisma). i'm not surprised by the dozens of awful reviews. she's stuck in this ghetto-black-i'm screaming-he's rapping- stuff that doesn't mean anything anymore (if it has ever). stop screaming. just sing. stop copying and faking. start inventing and daring. go one (well, a thousand) step beyond.  <br />in other words, my dear mariah, buy the last madonna cd. you'll see what music and creativity is. or look for your your parents' cds and listen to the beatles, elvis. or, hire someone who don't make people dislike you (if sales are good, but only in the us, next time people will stay away from your \\"music\\") <br />
B0000CABBW|2.0|Whale Rider is an okay movie. not the best movie i have seen it's okay and it does have a touching story to it. other than that i wouldn't buy it. It's slow & boring for me. but if you like these types of movies it's for you.<br /><br />Plot: Ever since Pieka was born her grandfather has rejected her because she wasn't a boy. Her grandfather is a tribe leader and he needs his grandson to take over for him, but instead he got a granddaughter. Paikea was a twin and her brother died at birth. Now Pikea has to show to her grandfather that she can lead the people and become a great leader.

0066620996|5.0|The primary thrust of the book is to present an analysis of winning US companies and how they achieved that status. Do they have anything in common? Can we learn something from their success? Most of the conclusions and comments are simple and convincing. The author helps us to focus on the goals and methods of maintaining and or growing a healthy business. The ideas even pertain to a small business or a government agency.<br /><br />I like the sports analogy in the book. In the Olympics as in life and business you have a broad variety of performers. The athletes for example are all different - even in the same Olympic event.<br /><br />The top athletes that go to the Olympics all have talent and they have good coaches. But only one person in that pyramid of athletes sits at the top at the end of the day with the Gold Medal. Usually there is more than just raw talent involved. It is a long process to reach that Gold medal and the athlete must have many other things. The winner has at a minimum the discipline and the passion or love of the sport to spend a lot of time preparing and honing their abilities. Plus he or she must have more than just a desire to compete but a clear and engrained desire to win. Together these are all key ingredients to make a winner.<br /><br />The book is very well researched and uses a group of bright and energetic college age researchers to help the author assemble and debate the facts - the performance of well known public companies over a long span of time. The facts are precise - they are financial performance versus peers - something that can be determined with precision. The winners are determined in this performance analysis of sales and earnings growth and stock prices. In some ways it is easy to measure these financial parameters and compare companies. It is harder to answer the question why (?) this company.<br /><br />As noted by other reviewers one must read the book carefully.<br /><br />Just like a glass of wine, the written book reviews do not do it justice and cannot completely convey the message.<br /><br />Read the book. If you are in business it is the type of book that you will keep within easy reach and look at from time to time.<br /><br />The book has a number of surprises (for myself) that shoot holes in the myth of the super duper CEO. He has a number of other good ideas about performance, team building, developing products, market selection, management, delegation, building companies, case studies, etc. One might disagree with some points but overall this is simply a great book and it is easy to see why it is a long-term best seller.<br /><br />A must buy and 5 stars.cannot completely convey the message.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|I went into this movie with a lot of doubt.  There has been numerous Kong remakes, sequels and such.  I was going into the theater thinking that I really don't want to be here. I thought I was going to see the exact same movies as all the other King Kong remakes.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  First let me warn you that is is a long long movie, just a bit over 3 hours.  And admittedly, the first part of the movie was a tad slow.  It was all character set up.  We get to understand the two man characters played by Jack Black and Naomi Watts.  The boat trip is the bridge to when the characters arrive on the island and from their, the movie not only really takes off, it is as different of a monster movie scenes than the previous versions.  This is where the picture shines the best.  It is intense, compelling and wonderfully acted.  The CGI look seemless.  In fact everything that takes place is so intense, you don't notice the audience around you anymore.  Of course for the main two human characters in the film, you don't know who is going to live or not, which was cool.  When the finally leave the island, I thought, ok, the good stuff is over and here comes the stereotypical fish-out-of-water King Kong sceen.  You know, people looking up, screaming, etc.  But you know what, there is nothing stereotypical about this (well, maybe one or two things).  Bravo to Jack Black for playing someone as different as he has previously.  Naomi Watts was her usually outstanding self for the roles she is given.  She has an Oscar coming to her one of these days.  And a very good job for Adrian Brody as well.  I have to warn you, it's not for young kids, at least not for those under the age of 10.  Still today's kids will eat this one up.  And it was well worth the admission price.  It needs to be seen on the big screen because it is good old-style movie making.  Peter Jackson is bonafide big time director.  I don't think Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard could have made a better movie.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|\\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is one of the most beloved songs in the history of popular music. A colossal #1 hit all over the world, it received every single award a song could win except an Oscar, and if it had been in a soundtrack it would have won that too. Garfunkel's vocals can only be described as angelic, and the arrangement is as rich as anything in the classical repertoire, resulting in one of the rare songs that is impossible not to feel deeply sentimental about. Heard extensively in the 1970's, in my opinion this song is almost underexposed now - maybe someday a filmmaker will choose it for a soundtrack and help it be discovered by a new audience.
0060007737|1.0|I found many of the basic principals of this booked flawed. <br />The internet branding portion is almost completely irrelevant, given what happened in the past few years.
0393314804|5.0|Welsh wrote this one while he still was a member of a writers' group in Edinburgh.  <br /> <br />You can tell. It's a page turner, episodic and full of gallows humour, twisted morality and ultrabathos. The film won't prepare you for even a fraction of it. This and The Acid House are Welsh's finest works in my opinion (excluding his early b-sides, hem-hem). <br /> <br />Even Scots readers often have problems with the language at first. Try reading aloud. If you enjoyed A Clockwork Orange, you'll have no problems, however, as even sans glossary, you can work out most of the slang... for anything else, go online. Resources on this book are extensive, and it is widely held to be one of the most popular literary books of this centuary.
B000006045|5.0|\\"Mezzanine\\" is, from start to finish, a classic. The bleakness of it all is a refreshing break from the happy-go-lucky world of today's music, even with the new whining trend in rock 'n' roll. Every piece of it is sheer perfection and if this is the future of music, as some reviewers forecast, then that future is extremely bright, even if it's industrially dark as well.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Style should be the name of the genre that the Gorillaz are making their name in, as their sound can barely be classified into any one category except new age and it definitely runs in its own path. Some have called it funk, some hip-hop, I've called it alternative, others have called it techno. They use all sorts of instrumental sounds: drums; electric and acoustic guitars; possibly a bell; a harmonica; a piano and keyboard; and with plenty of base backing these sounds.<br /><br />And we can't forgot the characters that make up the Gorillaz or their distinct, sometimes creepy, always funny appearances.<br /><br />Gorillaz Gorillaz is as varied as mentioned, but there seems to be one theme in all their songs: unpredictability. None of these songs seem to make much sense, and with their cool instrumentals a chaotic lyrics. The lyrics, all of them, are still great, from the slow voiced songs, to the classic-style raps, to the foreign language, all of them have a sound that's addictive.<br /><br />The stand-outs on this CD, and believe it or not there are some I think are a cut above the rest on this excellent CD, are Clint Eastwood, both the normal version and the remix; Sound Check, a haunting song about gravity; 19-2000 and the remix about cool shoe-shines (I think); and Rock the House, which carries a classic rap style that throws itself back to the days of the Sugerhill Gang's Rapper's Delight. But like I said, this CD has so many hits that the ones I consider the best are not the best by far.<br /><br />I can't really recommend this to any one group. Just buy it and you won't be sorry. The Gorillaz, with the release of this and their later CDs, have solidified themselves as a rare breed: that breed being the one that just doesn't mess up.
1401206905|4.0|Following what could be called the best Batman story ever, Dark Knight Returns, this book makes a fitting prelude.  But who's most striking is not so much Bruce Wayne, as DKR dug a lot deeper into hi psyche than this book does, but the young Lt. Jim Gordon. <br /> <br />Before Batman aided him in becoming commissioner, he was a tired man with a baby on the way and a discouraging job as an honest cop in a corrupt city. <br /> <br />Like so many heroes, Batman had a rocky start being accepted as a force for good in his city.  Nobody tells a story like this the way Frank Miller does.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Many other reviews state that this CD is \\"missing something\\" or is \\"too much like other artists\\", but I don't believe either of these opinions. Every track on this record is original and has something different to offer. Yes, it is true that I was, as many others were, lured in by the catchy and overplayed singles, but this is one of those few instances where I've actually ended up listening to and liking all of the songs on this CD. The rock stylings along with heartfelt piano melodies are one of the finer attributes of the songs, while the thoughtful lyrics add to the emotion and experience.This album is among my favorites and has been ever since I got it. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|This is kinda like Falling Into Infinity circa 2005 and shows that Dream Theater can still write a solid song. It's definitely not their best but it's a giant leap up from the sonic mess of metal ideas that was Train of Thought. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are mediocre, but the pop songwriting of \\"I Walk Beside You,\\" the metal and hard rock of \\"The Root of All Evil\\" and \\"Panic Attack,\\" and the epic 20 minute title track all make this album deserving of a listen. <br /> <br />In addition, drummer Mike Portnoy and vocalist James Labrie have both turned in their most tasteful and, in my opinion, best performances on their respective instruments on this album. Portnoy does not go overboard with his trademark double-bass fills and Labrie sings well within his range, expressing a lot of feeling and singing in a pleasing tone. <br /> <br />\\"Awake\\" it ain't, but Octavarium is a pleasant suprise from a band I'd given up on.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I don't know people.  Seems my brain cells got a little scrambled with this one. Let's see....can I sort it out? Man created God. Man formed Aqualung and like creatures were tortured and misused. However, the spirit of creation still lived within Aqualung because, although a man, he was a lesser man. And mankind did not realize the spirit lived in all men. So people, who is Charlie and why did he steal the handle?<br /><br />It is a chaotic universe to say the least.  Ian Anderson- with this one- is searching and trying to make sense of an absurd world. It seems to me that what he is saying is this - that your God will be as good as the sum of your total. Which, by today's standards, is not very good at all.<br /><br />  But.... let's get to the music. When your brain starts to hurt from trying to understand it all, that's when the ears have to do their job. Anderson begins this epic with some downright disgusting, awful creatures i.e; Aqualung, Cross-Eyed Mary, Mother Goose (screaming). The innocence of our youth is shot with these guys hanging around. Then an important observation in Cheap Day Return - Ian wonders if the nurse treats his old man correctly - she just cares about an autograph. Thus, what, if anything, is the \\"real\\" in any relationship. The answer is as diverse as there are people on earth. Ahhhhh..... but wait! Should we ask God to help us? Ian gives himself away and us answers by stating \\"We are our own saviours\\" in the song 'Wond'ring Aloud' and by the title of the next song, 'Up to Me'. Good, people, now we are getting somewhere.<br /><br />  Ian finally comes to terms with this faith-based journey with the epic 'My God.' Man has manipulated God. Has made God an excuse for reprehensible actions. However- your own personal God can be as fine or as terrible as you want him to be. After all, \\"He's inside you and me.\\" God- to Ian - is ever constant. And it is not man who is misused or ignored by God, but just the opposite. 'Hymn 43' reflects this theme. Yes. Life can be a chaotic jumble but, eventually, we will all just \\"Paddle right out of the mess\\" as in 'Slipstream\\".<br /><br />  Life is a train. It's out of control. In 'Locomotive Breath', Old Charlie (Christ?) stole the handle and the train won't stop going, no way to slow down. (I know, I know- that was the lyric).  The saga finally winds up with another big message.  In 'Wind-Up', nobody can teach you what God is. Or tell you how God wants you to be, or what is or is not acceptable to God. And then....... ahh..... can you feel your eyes opening...just a little?  Mankind manipulates God, in order to manipulate YOU! Pretty clever wrap-up that!<br /><br />  As in anything, this is just my interpretation, and, hopefully, an insightful and interesting one at that. On a more personal note, I got a chance to see them perform this on stage at The Fillmore East in New York in the early 70's. Just phenomenal! Anderson at his creative best and probably the best line-up he ever had over the years. I haven't said enough about the music. Very accomplished rock and very worth owning. As an afterthought - my opinions are never concrete and open to change. Thus, if you get this c.d. and don't agree with me- it is all fine. The c.d. begs that you \\"think\\" and in that regard Ian leaves it up to you. I thank all of you for reading my review. Gotta go now. See if I can jump off this locomotive!Life can be a chaotic jumble but, eventually, we will all just \\"Paddle right out of the mess\\" as in 'Slipstream\\". <br />     Life is a train.

B000BJS4BM|5.0|Although I agree that this is really for fans only, I do enjoy this Special Edition.  Unlike past Madonna Special Editions, this one actually has some value, including the bonus track, \\"Fighting Spirit\\", which is a grower.  The photo book is gorgeous, and I love the theme, which tells the story of a \\"woman on the dance floor\\".  The journal is not as great, only because, as a collector, you know you will not write in it.  At any rate, this is a nice gift for a Madonna fan.  The album is AWESOME, and if you do not want the Special Edition package, pick up the regular release.  You will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />Confessions On A Dance Floor is even chosen as one of Rolling Stone Magazines Top 50 Albums of the Year!
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is truly a great rock record. Caution:it takes a few listens before it really sinks in. After the first listen I was extremely disappointed. It wasn't anything like Audioslave's debut. But really what's the point in making the same album twice? So I gave it a few more tries, and after more listens the album really grew on me. Audioslave has truly gelled as a band, and sound more mature. Songs that really stand out: #1 Zero, Out of Exile, Heaven's Dead, Your Time Has Come, The Worm, The Curse. Easily the best rock record of the year!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I bought this album based on the positive recommendations I read here--and they were right.  From a touching rendition of a Dylan song by Willie Nelson, to the gorgeous singing of Emmylou Harris, to the surprise of hearing Rufus Wainwright singing \\"King of the Road\\"--I played this album through twice when I got it.  I find that the nonvocal movie theme music provides nice interludes between the vocal numbers.  Rewarding on many levels, this is a great soundtrack.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I've seen the Stipes live and agree that this DVD captures the spirit of their live performances. Yes it's a crazy mixed up mess but it all comes out right in the end. The filming is as edgy and grainy as their music and they exude a raw presence that a whole lot of bands strive for but few attain.<br /><br />For those who question their musical talent: check out Jack throughout the entire show - his playing is really remarkable. As for Meg's drumming - I don't think anyone could do better or add to their performance. (Sometimes it's true that you can have `too many notes.')<br /><br />The Stripes a live band more than anything else and this DVD captures to garage quality of their show.
0395389496|5.0|The book, The Polar Express (winner of the 1986 Caldecott Medal), is great. My 4 year old son has loved it since he was 2.<br /><br />Do yourself and/or your child(ren) a favor. Stick with the book. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks and Warner Bros RUINED their chance to make a simple, beautiful movie from this simple, beautiful book. The movie is full of extra, unrelated, unecessary, bizarre and sometimes scary crap that absolutely ruins the story. My son flat out stated that he didn't like the movie and kept asking why it was so different from the book that he adores.<br /><br />Again, though, I heartily recommend the book to anyone. It is a very special story, and the illustrations are wonderful. What a shame that the movie producers couldn't just stick with what was already so well written.

B000068OSK|4.0|The album that really defines the Stripes. The recording is edgy and raw and exudes a power and confidence that other bands only try to imitate. I was surprised to learn what an excellent guitarist Jack White is and he really shines on this CD. His slide work is really good. And for all the complaining I love Meg on the drums - just a good beat without a whole lot of `filler.' There's a good catch phrase for the Stripes - `more real music, less filler.\\"  A must have for so many reasons.

B0007LXJDM|4.0|I was surprised by the dark sentiment of the film but I suppose that `Neverland' would not likely come from a happy soul.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie tremendously and thought the boys stole the show. The performances by Depp and Winslett were excellent but it was their interaction with the now fatherless boys that gave the movie its tender quality.<br /><br />One thing I wish is that the writers developed both of Barrie's female relationships more. I never really did understand the rift with his wife: they seemed quite happy together even when he was first gallivanting with his new found family. They finally dissolve without much of a hint as to why. His relationship with Davies is equally confusing: he meets her with her boys in a public park and within a matter of days or weeks they are playing house. I can see why some reviewers thought the relationship to be creepy - it was odd at best.<br /><br />An excellent movie that makes you feel that you want to be closer to those around you.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I love this CD. It has a variety of music genres on it and I would recommend this CD to anyone who listens to a wide range of music like I do. You will not appreciate this CD unless you listen to a little bit of everything. It is the ultimate chill CD and I listen to it all the time. Love it!!!!!!!
B00097DXZS|1.0|I remember way back when Santana was a band.  There were actuall members of the group.  Santana has, over the course of years, turned itself from a highly progressive and original band, to a solo guitarist who changes the line-up of the band way too often.  Is there a Santana band anymore? Last time I checked, Carlos is the only one that comes out in commercials, liner notes, ads, photos, etc.  This album is the third, and hopefully the last, in a series of Carlos Santana's collaborations with other artists.  Only four, (FOUR!) songs out of the whole album is Santana by itself.  The rest is Carlos Santana playing with other groups.  The only good song (which is actually a mediocre song at best) is the first one, Hermes.   <br />Santana has often had albums in 3's.  Their first 3, then the 3 jazz fusion albums, then the 3 \\"Back to Basics\\" albums (Amigos, Festival, and Moonflower).  Hopefully, All That I Am is the end of a trilogy of commercial sell-out albums.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|The traditional smoothness of Diana Krall's versions of these Christmas songs is refreshing and welcome. I like her style. It is genuine. She has that great smooth and crisp sounding voice and the soft jazz approach of these standard Christmas songs is impressive and captivating. The quality and craftsmanship of the artistry on this CD really enhances the Christmas season.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Madonna's new Album Rocks, this album, without a doubt awesome, its fun, full of energy and great music that will make you dance, I love it. <br />It's been in my car and in my IPOD since the release and I have not switch to any other artist. <br />She is great entertainer; I bought 8 CD for gifts this Holiday. <br />Cheers <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya's music remains enchanting and beautiful. Her voice along with some of the soft piano accompaniments and solos are undeniably meditative and relaxing. I often find myself drifting off into reflections of peaceful euphoria. This album seems a little different from her previous ones. It seems to have more of a cohesive quality, which I just cannot really put my finger on. I like it.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I could not imagine my wife and I spending our Sunday evening TV viewing hours watching a concert on DVD!  But we did!  I sucked us right in and we couldn't turn it off! <br />And I was constantly amazed of how talented this guy really is.  Listening to CDs, yeah you hear the music, but when you see it, and the interaction with the band and the audience, and the lights and the set, well, it's just incredible!! <br />This guy is heading straight to the top! <br />And I hope DVD is the wave of the future of music, so you can really experience the artists.  CDs are one diminsional, bleh.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Moronic and down right boring Keanu Reeves vehicle is an insult to your senses. The movie is shot way too dark in certain scenes of the film and the special effects are tepid at the very best. Keanu Reeves gives his all but regardless of his efforts, he's not right for the role. His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happing.  Makes no sense but that's some of the inconstancies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now.  That would have worked much better and been much more effective than the overblown special effects movie that it is now and probably would have been much scarier to boot.  I would have rather paid to see that then this film right here.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Great movie! <br />Great dinosaurs! <br />Great Gorilla! <br />Great Action! <br />Great Romance between beauty and a groilla! <br />But I din't like the part with the bugs. <br />Puts a tear in your eye when Kong dies. <br />I hope Peter Jackson gets an oscar award for this! <br />Great dedication for Fay Wray at the end of the credits. <br />Very releastic as if it was the 1930's <br />Even though i don't like Lord of the Rings I still think Peter Jackson's a great director <br />And I'm definetley getting this when it's released on DVD and I hope it's a deluxe edition loaded with extra features! <br />Oh and along with thousands of other people i really hate the fact that the King Kong ride at Universal Studios was replaced by Revenge of The Mummy. It was an awesome ride! Best ride ever! <br />
B000BB1MI2|2.0|I wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't open my heart to it.  It is strangely cold and unwelcoming.  I like Depp normally but this performance missed the mark somehow.  It's like he couldn't quite find a rhythm for the character.  There are very few laughs and a hackneyed storyline involving Wonka's father that seemed superfluous.  The effects are neat, but without a compelling story it really doesn't matter.  Burton managed to squeeze the humanity and fun out of the beloved Dahl story, and left us with something chilly and bizarre.  And not in a good way.
B00008NGHI|5.0|For the audiophiles: Among my favorite SACD's.  I listen to the SACD stereo layer on a quality headphone rig, and this recording is very-well done, clear, natural, balanced, and very well-mixed.  In fact, I prefer it to her SACD 'New Favorite', both in performance and recording playback.  The performance, mixing, and recording quality is among the best of live albums that I've heard, and is better than most of the studio recordings I own.  Worthy of the SACD format, and of high-quality playback hardware.  A good disc for demonstrating your system.  Note: I have not listened to the 5.1 layer. <br /> <br />For the Music Lovers: This album really grew on me quickly and is now one of my favorite albums.  Alison's vocal abilities are stunning; her abilities are exemplified even more clearly when you consider that this is a live album.  bluegrass/country music collector or not, anyone willing to appreciate the top offerings in a genre will likely enjoy this album.  It would be hard to not acknowledge the mastery of musicianship, vocals, and selection of songs.
B000091A5V|1.0|I absolutely love Nirvana.  I have about $3000 in incredibly rare nirvana memorabilia.  Altough In Utero is my definite pick of studio albums, most people don't realize that there are about 10 other side collections, collections that you can really only find on Ebay...these albums had the most unbelievable side of Nirvana noone ever hears. <br /> <br />Is there anyone out there who has heard of the Outcesticide series? Anyone? <br /> <br />I hate this album because it is a collection of the most easily accesible Nirvana songs ever.  My father barely knows how to run a computer and made this cd of downloaded songs exact in 45 minutes!!!These songs are everywhere.   <br /> <br />Anyone ever heard of the song Sappy? NO.  It's on Outcesticide 1.  It's a song about Kurt's turtle.  Didn't know he had one huh?  How about D7 from Hormoaning EP?  You'll never hear that one...about heroine use. <br /> <br />For every album you find here, there are 2 more to discover.  Look on ebay, there are so many entire concert cd's it's crazy. <br /> <br />I hate this album because Nirvana didn't release it, and not because Kurt's dead, because Krist Novoselic (bass) and Dave Grohl didn't release it.  This was released after those 2 lost the rights of the band to Courtney Love.  This disc was released soley on the purpose of getting Dave Geffen another house and to put another unearned greenback in Courtney's husband-murdering wallet. <br /> <br />If you wanna get a studio release that will really break open Nirvana for you, go get In Utero or Bleach because you hear from their hearts.  Unplugged is absolutely phenomenal as well.  Nevermind is a great album too but you can hear that on the radio. So why give another cent to Courtney Love because the remaining member's won't see a dime of it. <br /> <br />Spend your cash on anything else out by Nirvana, go download some rarities or get the video \\"Nirvana Live: Sold Out.\\"  At the end of which there is the sickest version of \\"Endless, Nameless\\" (also known as the \\"secret song\\" off of the original Nevermind press)which i believe to be the best explanation of how the band used to go off the hook.   <br /> <br />Great songs.  Poor cd because these songs are way too accessible. Get In Utero, Bleach or Unplugged for your money's worth.
1563898586|5.0|Personaly, I am not a big reader, which presnets a delima when it is a requirement for me to be reading something in lit class. So i choose LXG because of the fact that it is a great movie and the book is a graphic novel. Once I started reading this book i could not put it down due to the great illustrations and the very interesting plot. <br />This is a great book which definalty meets my high expections for it (because of the movie). I would definatly recomend this this book to any kind of aduience that enjoys science fiction and/or history. I give this book five stars because it surpasses what is expected of it and provides a fun read. <br /> <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|If you're a fan of Roald Dahl's book, this movie is definitely for you. Unlike it's very good predecessor starring Gene Wilder, this one stays closer to the book and doesn't add new storylines. Gone from the Wilder movie is the fizzy lifting drink scene. The golden eggs from the older movie are replaced by squirrels and nuts, as stated in the book. Still missing in action, however, is the chapter \\"Square Candies that Look Round\\". The other four children also have two parents go with them to the factory in the book. <br /> <br />What is missing in the adaptation is made up for by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast. If you are a Depp fan this one should be at the top of the list (right there with Pirates). The Oompa Loompas are all done by the same guy through some advanced special effects. While the popular \\"oompa loompa\\" song is missing from this version, the oompa loompas sing the old lyrics that are printed in the book. <br /> <br />Tim Burton's influence is also worth it. While it does add a bit of darkness to the story (which you won't find in the Wilder version) it does make the film very impressive. <br /> <br />Special effects are excellent. The movie is also family friendly and doesn't have the sex or f-bombs that many modern movies have. I recommend this to anyone, especially fans of the book and Johnny Depp.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Hey teenagers...    Pssst, get this...    (whispers) music is dead    Shhhhhh don't tell anyone i told you - you need to keep wasting your money on it to keep these (and other) talentless reprobates employed.
B000002QWD|5.0|This is an album that should be in everyone's Christmas collection. It features not only Bing Crosby, but also the Andrews Sisters. <br /> <br />White Christmas, the smash single that was also the namesake of a movie, is perhaps the most well-known track on this album. Another popular track on this album is Jingle Bells. While there have been some recent remakes of this version (it features a distinctive clarinet solo) this one is by far the best. Mele Kelikemaka is a Hawaiian Christmas song that is widely known, and the Bing Crosby version seems to be the most popular version. Christmas in Killarney is another song that seems to be unique to Bing. <br /> <br />There are many other well-known carols on this album as well including Silent Night, Adeste Fideles (with both Latin and English), Santa Claus is Coming to Town, I'll Be Home for Christmas, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, Silver Bells, and It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas. All are done in a style that appeals to any age group. <br /> <br />Faith of Our Fathers is not technically a Christmas song but it's on the album too. Great rendition of it, too. <br /> <br />While Bing has indeed recorded more songs than the ones here, this album contains a great variety of carols that will please anyone.
B000002WCJ|5.0|Helloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 2 is one of my favorite albums ever. This album just really flows my boat, combining a fierce duel-guitar attack, some great bass and drum work, and Michael Kiske's vocals, which are some of the best that I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Today, Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II is considered a model for power metal albums, and for a good reason. Simply put, the music in here is exellent. There are so many classic tunes in Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II.  <br /> <br />Some of my favorites are Eagly Fly Free with it's nice uplifting feeling, Save Us, which is a fast tune with a nice chorus and great guitar solos, and March of Time, which has great lyrics and a very, very catchy chorus. <br /> <br />Then there is I Want Out, which has entered my pantheon of favorite songs ever. I Want Out is just such an awesome song. It starts out with very catchy riffs, has some very good and interesting lyrics, and has an anthemic chorus with great vocals.  It's hard not to get the chills when you hear Michael Kiske screaming \\"live my life and to be FREEEEE!!\\" while the catchy riff is being played towards the end of the song. I hadn't been blown away as much by a song since the first time I heard Iron Maiden's The Trooper. <br /> <br />The other tracks are also great, which include You Always Walk Alone, Rise and Fall, Dr. Stein, We Got the Right, and especially the epic Keeper of the Seven Keys. <br /> <br />Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II is a great album. I'm a fan of understandable metal (metal without all the growling and screaming). Keepers Part II is a great album that will obviously appeal to power metal fans, but also fans of metal period. Keepers Part II is to power metal such as what Master of Puppets is to trash metal, it's just that good and important to the metal genre.
B000089CJI|4.0|Usually, I listen to stuff that's a lot heavier, but this just does something for me. I think the one thing that I really appreciate about this album are the dynamics. From song to song the flow of the album changes a lot. Not only does it vary from song to song, but the singers use of dynamics also impresses me. I think that is one big factor in my attraction to softer music... the use of tasteful dynamics. This really does sound like a happier/electronic Death Cab, but I think it's worth the money. If you like Death Cab a lot, this is a must for your collection. The songs are just very well written. Buy it. It will make you happy.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|On very rare occasions, it's a good idea not to follow the book.<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer's cult novel \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" has a wild chronology, and the journey is sprinkled with magical realism and countless flashbacks to minor characters. It COULD be crammed into a film, but it would not be a very accessible one. In fact, it might be almost unwatchable.<br /><br />Enter actor Liev Schreiber, who chopped out much of the backstory and focused on the \\"road movie in the Ukraine\\" storyline. No, it's not like the book. But taken on its own, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is a a striking, humorous and poignant film. Schreiber should be proud.<br /><br />Jonathan (Elijah Wood) has a funny fixation about remembering the past, which includes putting life souvenirs in plastic baggies and taping them to the wall. So his curiosity is piqued when his grandmother tells him of Augustina, a woman who rescued his grandfather during World War II. With only a ring and a photo to guide him, Jonathan travels to the Ukraine to find Augustine.<br /><br />He's met at the station by Alex (Eugene Hutz), a hip-hop tour guide who speaks his own peculiar dialect, Alex's weird, melancholy grandad (Stephen Samudovsky), and grandad's \\"seeing eye b*tch.\\" As they search the Ukraine for Augustine, if she is still alive, Jonathan begins to learn about the ways the past infringes on the present -- and a bit about himself as well.<br /><br />Schreiber apparently decided to adapt \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" when he began to chronicle his own family history, and discovered that it was strikingly similar to Foer's novel. For a beloved cult novel, editing and reshaping is a risky business. But in Schreiber's case, it becomes a whole different animal -- it retains the spirit of the original, if not the sense of history.<br /><br />While this is Liev Schreiber's directorial debut, it doesn't feel like one. Instead, it feels polished and experienced, with beautiful cinematography that ranges from night skies to a field of dazzling sunflowers. In sepia-toned flashbacks, Schreiber follows the less-is-more rule by merely hinting at the Holocaust's horrors, which is, oddly enough, more effective.<br /><br />And his script has pathos and anguish, but also plenty of humour (most of it provided by Hutz), such as the scene where he tries to figure out what a vegetarian is, prompting Wood to tell him firmly \\"Nothing! No meat!\\"... only to have both men ask what's wrong with him. The only problem is that at times the road-trip format gets a bit precious, and the storyline stalls once or twice.<br /><br />Elijah Wood gives a remarkably subtle performance as a quiet, slightly neurotic young man who seems to be searching for something in the past to make him complete. Hutz balances him out with the colourful, slightly wonky Alex. He's both comic relief and a sort of wiser older brother for Jonathan. The plot revolves around these two, and they are balanced out well.<br /><br />Okay, it's not the book. But then again, it really doesn't pretend to be. Instead, Liev Schreiber's \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is a bittersweet comedy that will leave you with a smile.sunflowers.

B0001I562I|5.0|This is a really beautiful and very intelligent film, its got  a very good story with great special effects and good acting, its got some very funny dialogue betwen Max and David too. Its a great film. Its nice to read the reviews you guys have written, it seems there are many other people who feel just the way I do about the film. I wish the DVD would of had more special features like an interview  with Joey Cramer and those kinds of things. Because of Christmas I recently bought this film for my 10 year old nephew. I remember I saw it first when I was about 8 years old and I saw it once on TV about 9 years ago, I am now 25 and I hadnt seen it since. When I got it for my nephew just recently I watched it probably 5-10 times before I gave it to him, I loved it, im a teacher too and I even showed it my class. I sent the DVD by mail to my nephew who lives far from me but I think I will buy another copy and keep it for myself. Its one of those great movies like The Neverending story and the Goonies, im sure it will be around for generations. Maybe they should do a remake of it and release it again or somthing. Its great I loved it.  <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is a classic, simple as that. Its got everything a good rock album should have; heavy riffs, classic solos, and totally uncompromising lyrics. In fact, uncompromising is a pretty good word for this album, and GN'R in general. Its a trait that has got them into trouble over the years, but I wouldnt want them any other way. Musically, I guess you could describe this as a blend of the best parts of Punk and Heavy Metal. Its just great Rock n' Roll.   <br /> <br />BTW, to the fool who's been going around Amazon.com posting idiotic, insulting and childish reviews (there's always one, isnt there?), could you please either express your opinions in a way that is somewhat mature and intelligent (or at least semi-literate. Capital letters and punctuation are not the enemy!). You have the nerve to call people who like an album you dont like \\"losers\\", and accuse them of just giving good reviews to \\"fit in\\" or be cool. Who posts a review on Amazon.com to try to be cool? Slightly flawed theory, dont you think? You also have some nerve asking people what \\"their\\" problem is! You're the one with the problem, a major ego problem. I hope for your sake you're only 14, at least then you have an excuse. By the way, I have listened to the album, so has everybody who reviewed it.
B000084T18|1.0|Rather than comment on each song and give most of them 10/10, I'm gonna be real and say this sucks.

B00005JO04|4.0|Two oil companies working in the muddle east merge and they assign and attorney from the law firm that represents them (there is some indication that the law firm may have an actual financial interest in the oil companies)  to find out why they failed to get a specific contract that went to the Chinese.  <br />\So we have legal eagles  and oil power brokers breaking the law and they assign a lawyer from their own firm to investigate the contract with the Chinese and why their undue influence did not work.  They are so powerful they can didctate to the CIA and to the King of (call it Syriana) who shuld be the next Amir and it wont be the liberal # 1 son but the weak # 2 son. <br />Agent BOB is assigned by the CIA to kill number 1 son so the path is clear for # 2. He goes to Lebanon to get permissin from the AlKaydda (spelling) to operate in Lebanon. They agree but the man they use as a connection for Bob turns on agent Bob until the leader of the AlKaydda intervenes. After all, he gave Bob his word. <br />Bob now suspects that something is up. He finds out that the # 1 man in the law firm is dircting all of this including him so he goes to this man and makes sure that the # 1 lawyer knows that if he Bob is not freed up from this investigation, he will kill the lawyers family. <br />Bob now freed up and passport worthy, goes back to Lebanon and attempts to interfer with a direct CIA missle attack on # 1 son as he and his group of generals move to take over the country.  Bob is successful in stopping the caravan and while standing next to the young prince's Rover, the missle hits and blows him and the prince and his wife to bits.So much for America's promotion of democratic liberal Amirs who want to do right by their country and institute progressive ideas like voting and freedom for women. <br />In the mean time, two young Pakistani youths are turned into human bombs with a weapon that it just so happened that BOB sold to some bad guys early in the movie and they ramthis weapon into the oil company to make a point they know nothing about and become martyrs. <br />Conclusion: to get the oil merger approved, the oil company and the law firm have to give up sacrifical lambs to the slaughter for violations of the law and in the end, the major oil and legal pwer brokers sacrifice BOB, one of their own and....some third party guy who works for the freedom of Iran from the tyranny of the Ayatollah, to get the merger and oil fields they want, all in the name of cheaper gas prices.Matt Damon? after his client was blown up, he decides it might just be in his best interest to go home to America and his wife and remaining kid and live on his $175 million. AFter all, had he not chaged seat with the Prince's wife, he would be dead along with the Prince. <br /> <br />Conclusion: America, the oil company, the law firm and the American people got exactly what they wanted, Syriana a muddle east country puppet they can control.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|hey dont get me wrong i like the show. <br />but when i got The Complete Series.  <br />it was not The Complete Series <br />it had two disks labled disk 3. <br />so now i am hopeing for a exchange
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce is a beautiful young woman and has a voice(I'm not even sure if it is so great as everyone hypes it to be) but this cd is just ok. I don't see how she won five grammys for this material. I feel a great cd should have a mix of uptempo, midtempo, and ballads. This cd is just marred down with a lot of slow tempo and ballad-like songs that really don't hit the soul. When I listen to an R&B cd I like to hear songs that hit the soul. \\"Crazy in Love\\" is a great song with a killer beat but that's where the fun ends. I think alot of people bought this album based on that one song expecting the others to be similar. The cd has 4 uptempo songs followed by  11 subpar ballads and slow tempo songs that sound alike and mesh into each other. The cd is not the worst cd but it definitely isn't great. If you want hear how this cd should have sounded listen to Tamar's (Toni Braxton's sister) cd.
B000002N9L|5.0|I can sort of see why the Come CD would maybe make them mad, but not this one. Well, maybe singing about ejaculating all over the floor and the last track, \\"Had U,\\" would do it, but I don't know. If you ask me, I think Chaos and Disorder is another one of his masterpieces and Warner Bros should be thankful that Prince is so damn talented. This CD is almost as good as the Gold Experience! <br /> <br />I guess why some people don't like Chaos and Disorder too well, is because it's more rock than funk. This is probably the hardest rocking CD he's ever done! Just because it's lacking the funk doesn't mean that this sucks. Every song on here is actually really good, and there isn't any filler at all. I'm really glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews on here, and went ahead and bought this. \\"Chaos and Disorder,\\" \\"Dinner With Delores,\\" \\"I Rock, Therefore I Am,\\" and \\"Into The Light,\\" are some of his best songs! <br /> <br />
B000ASDFJU|4.0|Don't let fans like c.lake taint your opinion of the show.  When the tsunami comes and drowns everyone on the coasts we surely won't cry about it; good riddance to snarky jerks who don't even read the reviews they are complaining about.    My only problem with the entire S&tC series is that Carrie ended up with Big in the end.  He was a creep.    EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention this before but a BIBLIOPHILE is a person who likes BOOKS, not someone who is really into THE BIBLE.  Good old c.lake disproves the myth that all the stupid, subliterate morons in America live in \\"fly over country.\\"  Quite a few of them live on the coasts, too.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Its a disgrace about the current state of rap. With Jay-Z goodbye, Eminem calling it quits just recently and bad pop-rap rappers like 50 Cent and Ja Rule controlling our airwaves, we dont know what to expect. That is until Kanye West released his 2004 debut \\"The College Dropout\\". This is not pop-rap saying he's gangsta, but how rap should be done. His obvious political and religious message in \\"Jesus Walks\\" is something different from talking about the ho's, ice, drugs and Escalades with 20 inch rims. Yes, that is on this album but it is done how it should be, with quality. <br /> <br />This will not go down as the greatest rap album of all time, but Kanye West and his debut will go down as the savior of modern rap. What the music world is going through today, with horrible rap and the nu-metal scene, we should be proud of performers like Kanye West. But as for the album, it has some great songs and it has its weak songs, but that is how it is on every rap album. So, if you are looking for a good modern rapper, get Kanye West's \\"The College Dropout\\" and his 2005 sophomore album \\"Late Registration\\" which I am not much of a fan of.  <br /> <br />Final Grade: 4.5 out of 5 - Kanye West For President
068817776X|5.0|I found out about the book through a recommended reading from Amazon and chose to buy it.  I enjoyed every minute of it and finished reading it in one day.  The account of mrs. Beer's life and how she chooses to phrase things made me feel as if she was actually in front of me telling me the story.  I liked the fact that she explained the consequences she had for doing certain things and how that ended up tying to something that happens later. <br />it was nice to see photos so I could put a face to the names. <br />i commend her for sharing her story and her life with an audience like me.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I was at a Fall out Boy show the day this album came out, and Panic happened to be opening. They were so amazing live that I ran to the lobby to buy their cd. Though Brendon's vocals have been compared to Patrick Stump's, there is certainly a distinct difference, and live, it is even more noticeable. Urie uses raw power behind his vocals--he didn't even really need the microphone. <br /> <br />The album itself is well-crafted and a slight variation on the usual pop-punk/ emo genre. Ryan Ross' lyrics are clever and often, a little unbalanced, the hooks are like heroin, addictive to a fault, and the entire experience really makes you want to dance. <br /> <br />I think that we can expect terrific things from Panic! At The Disco, despite the inevitable crtical fallout (pun intended) they are receiving. <br /> <br />An honest and true effort, should leave you smiling and tapping your toes.
B0002KVULG|3.0|i saw this movie when it first came out in 1979 and it scared me out of a nights sleep. i bought it on laserdisc and found it didn't hold up very well,and the transfer was less than fine also. still i love vampire movies and bought the dvd when it came out. the transfer is fine but it still doesn't live up to the first viewing i had. the actors are great , the score is one of the best i ever heard for a vampire movie, the sets are wonderful, but something is still missing and the film still leaves me just a little misty for the effect it had on me in 1979.
0765309408|5.0|I don't read much sci-fi because so much of it is so bad. But if everyone told a story as well as John Scalzi, I'd read a lot more.<br /><br />  On Scalzi's Earth, many centuries in the future, you can sign up to join Colonial Defense Forces when you're 65. Actual enlistment doesn't occur until you turn 75. Senior citizens as soldiers? Yes. The CDF's task is to make the habitable planets of the Universe safe for human colonization. And it's a nasty Universe out there: hundreds of sentient species also want those few habitable planets.<br /><br />  Scalzi crafts a marvelous story around John Perry, an advertising copywriter from Ohio. Perry's wife died almost a decade earlier and Perry, on his 75th birthday, finishes up the enlistment process.<br /><br />  The CDF doesn't talk much on Earth about its activities out amongst the stars. Large numbers of Indians and Pakistanis are emigrants, seeking a better life far from Earth. But little is known about the CDF and why they want only old people as enlistees. There are rumors that they are reborn in one way or another.<br /><br />  Perry learns the truth as he is initiated into the CDF. He becomes a strong, vigorous solder fighting on behalf of human colonists. Perry, as the hero of the story, isn't your average soldier. He does some heroic deeds and has more than his fair share of luck, earning him respect, rank and medals.<br /><br />  But Scalzi creates a great story of combat against alien species, the impact of renewed youth on old people, the politics of a policy where force is the first order of the day and he throws in a unique reincanation angle as well.<br /><br />  This is a relatively short book, only 322 pages. And every page in engrossing. Scaezi has a sequel out - and I can hardly wait to read it. This guy is a great science fiction writer.<br /><br />Jerry
B0000CNY27|4.0|i saw this when it first came out and it still is one of the best action films of the 80's. kurt russell and john charptner are the john wayne and john ford of their generation. there isn't a false note in this fast and fun action movie. just enjoy the fun and fantasy of a pre 9/11 future new york and as they say of the \\"duke\\" this film \\"is a number one , the tops\\" . it also has one of lee van cleef's last proformances. he truley was one of the most underrated actors in film history. enjoy it and call him \\"snake\\"
B00005JOFO|5.0|1963 Wyoming range provides a quaint and ultimately charming setting for the spirited romance between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). These two cowboys fall in love with each other on a sheep herding job.<br /><br />The plot of the film though, is their carrying on the relationship in secret. The two men must do this because of whom they are and the times in which they live in. Specifically, they are after the magic of their first summer together--something readily transcending labels, categories, and generations.<br /><br />Director Ang Lee did a tremendous job with the movie, based upon E. Annie Proulx's short story. Credit also goes to Dianna Ossana and Larry McMurty for a great screenplay. I've unfortunately seen enough movies to know that great adaptations are the exception rather than the rule. In addition to it being set in the early 1960's there actually is the feel. It wasn't just a case of somebody claiming their film was set in the 1960's with obviously current props.<br /><br />I am really impressed with the people who were involved with this film. In spite of the meterosexualization of society, heterosexual American men are still squeamish about being involved with anything related to gay sex. This heterosexual woman joins Madonna in commending Ledger and Gyllenhaal both for their decision to read for the film. I honestly do find it shocking that these hang-ups remain in 2005.<br /><br />Some films you have to guess why they have received awards and award nominations. However, Brokeback Mountain is one of the titles where audiences will instantly know why it won or was nominated for (among the countless honors) National Board of Review Top 10 Films, Director of the Year, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Best Picture, Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, and Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director, Best Actor Motion Picture Drama, and Best Supporting Actress./> <br /> <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|We're in front of what has been 2005's best album without a doubt. It's a pleasure to put this record high in your car when you're on your everyday morning journey. I've been doing it since I own this CD and I think I'll never get bored of it. James Blunt makes music as it was made before, with his heart. How, if not, would someone publish so much beauty in a couple of songs? If I had the chance I'd tell everyone who's someone in music bu$ine$$ to put away their fears and bet for people like James. Maybe, that way, one of the most valorous treasures humans ever invented could be cured from it's long time illness. <br />1- High 4/5 <br />2- Wisemen 4/5 <br />3- You're beautiful 5/5   Way better the single version <br />4- Goodbye my lover 6/5   Best of the whole album. Don't worry if you drop a tear with this one, it might remind you to some situation you're going through. <br />5- Tears and rain 3.5/5   Big potential, foolishly wasted <br />6- Out of my mind 3/5   Weakest <br />7- So long Jimmy 4.5/5   <br />8- Billy 5/5   I love the piano riff after chorus <br />9- Cry 5/5   Beautiful, emotional, great. 2nd favourite. <br />10- No bravery 4.5/5  Nice ending <br /> <br />As you see, there are no bad songs here. Give Back to Bedlam a try, you won't regret it. <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|First, put on the CD of \\"Born to Run\\". The new mix sounds brighter than the previous CD (there is an audiophile-targeted version that some people like better).<br /><br />If you've never heard the CD, it's something that was meant to be played in the car on a summer night. \\"Thunder Road\\" (the title taken from a Robert Mitchum movie) about a romantic young man begging Mary to \\"get the hell out of Dodge\\" because it's a town full of losers. Next is \\"Tenth Ave. Freeze Out\\", Bruce's bio of the E Street Band and meeting Clarence Clemons. \\"Night\\" is another \\"getting out\\" song, getting out of work to go racing in the night and cruising, something that \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" would explore more. \\"Backstreets\\" is about broken friendships, where the best friend got out and left him there.<br /><br />\\"Born To Run\\", the unofficial anthem of Jersey, is another \\"getting out\\" song, pays homage to Phil Spector, and pours everything into it as if his life depends on it. \\"She's The One\\"  has got the \\"Bo Diddley\\" beat about a heartbreaker. \\"Meeting Across The River\\", something that could've been off the first 2 albums, about 2 young guys doing something they shouldn't be doing. The song would be perfect for a \\"Sopranos\\" episode.... Clarence's sax playing on here is haunting. The final track, \\"Jungleland\\", winds it all up, not just for \\"Born To Run\\", but for the type of writing he did for his first 3 albums, specifically \\"Rosalita\\" and \\"NYC Serenade\\" off of his second album. The sax solo takes the song up a notch.<br /><br />The album cover is one of the most recognizable, with Bruce on one side, guitar in hand with an Elvis button and Clarence on the back cover playing the sax. It's not a dated \\"70s\\" album.<br /><br />The 2 DVDs are the reason to pick this up though. The first, called \\"Wings for Wheels\\", could've been part of the \\"Classic Albums\\" series. It goes into detail about Bruce being on thin ice with the label and having to put something out to put him on the map, and everything that happened during the sessions,including having to replace 2 band members. The band recounts working on grueling sessions for hours upon hours. Bruce is interviewed driving to the place he was trying to get away from as well as in the studio. As with \\"Classic Albums\\", Bruce and Jon Landau discuss the songs at the soundboard. There are a few surprises  here: videotapes of the sessions that show Bruce at his crankiest and weary, but keeping it going; in Surround sound, you get to hear some of the demos on their own.  Bruce's former manager Mike Appel is also part of it, which is kind of a surprise considering they battled in court after this album, but time must have healed some wounds, but both Bruce and Jon give Mike credit for keeping them going when they were stuck. ..<br /><br />A CBS promo film from 1973 is included here and is a far cry from  the Bruce of the 80s or even \\"Born to Run\\". The E Street Band is loose and \\"jazzy\\", Bruce's acoustic roots that would come out in \\"Nebraska\\", \\"Tom Joad\\" and \\"Devils and Dust\\" are here. Too bad they didn't film the entire show, it looked like a lot of fun.<br /><br />The other DVD, \\"Live at Hammersmith Odeon\\" was long-forgotten until a few years ago. Bruce thought he put on a terrible show at the time because of how the British received them(politely, and if you see Old Grey Whistle Test DVD, the reviewer wasn't impressed). Supposedly he stormed off stage at the end, but it looked like he has fun in the film. On \\"Wings for Wheels\\", Bruce didn't care for how they were promoting him and started tearing down posters in the venue.<br /><br />But watching this, it's a crime that it was never released sooner. It's a representative setlist of his earlier shows, where \\"Rosalita\\" was the highlight, and a majority of \\"Born To Run\\" is done in concert, minus \\"Night\\" and \\"Meeting Across the River\\", both of which were rarely done in concert since, although the latter was done on his acoustic tour earlier this year.<br /><br />The \\"Live 1975-1985\\" CD is mostly Springsteen from 1978 on, a more polished show, samplings from different tours, and you can tell that the shows were a far cry from the early shows after watching this and the 1973 footage. \\"E Street Shuffle\\" is a far different version from the studio version, and you get to hear \\"Lost in the Flood\\", \\"Kitty's Back\\", and \\"For You\\", and towards the end, the closers \\"Detroit Medley\\" and \\"Quarter To Three\\" which turned the venue into a neighborhood bar, the E Street Band being the best bar band in the world.<br /><br />The footage is mixed quality, the footage from the stage looks like it was filmed last week, but from the front, it's more grainier, but not bad enough to be distracted from watching a great show unfold.<br /><br />Bruce is one of the most bootlegged artists, and justifiably so. The live shows were and are always what sold him to people more than the albums ever did, although from \\"Born To Run\\" on, he seemed to put more attention into his studio output, the \\"Tracks\\" box set shows that he always had a lot to work with, not to mention the overall tone of the albums could've been radically different with each of them.<br /><br />The tours have been recorded and filmed over the years, he's given the fans a lot in recent years, hopefully the tours from \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" to the marathon \\"Born in the USA\\" shows will also see the \\"light of day\\" on CD and DVD.ier this year.  <br /> <br />The \\"Live 1975-1985\\" CD is mostly Springsteen from 1978 on, a more polished show, samplings from different tours, and you can tell that the shows were a far cry from the early shows after watching this and the 1973 footage. \\"E Street Shuffle\\" is a far different version from the studio version, and you get to hear \\"Lost in the Flood\\", \\"Kitty's Back\\", and \\"For You\\", and towards the end, the closers \\"Detroit Medley\\" and \\"Quarter To Three\\" which turned the venue into a neighborhood bar, the E Street Band being the best bar band in the world.  <br /> <br />The footage is mixed quality, the footage from the stage looks like it was filmed last week, but from the front, it's more grainier, but not bad enough to be distracted from watching a great show unfold.  <br /> <br />Bruce is one of the most bootlegged artists, and justifiably so.

068987474X|4.0|Meet cute guy, give cute guy number. Guy doesn't call. Why?<br /><br />Many reasons, not all necessarily bad. Some guys feel anxiety around women, unsure whether woman is attracted so will freeze instead of getting number.  Sometimes a guy may psyche himself out of it. Maybe he lost your number, or maybe he got several numbers, and got confused.<br /><br />Have an abundance mentality. Men are like buses.  There will be another one along shortly.<br /><br />Alternatively, he may have liked you, but upon reflection, there was something about you, and it could be something trivial, like you had man hands, overweight, thick neck, too tall, too short, wrong curves, inappropriate fungus growth, too needy, too inattentive, literally anything.<br /><br />Recently, I attended a meeting where a recently married couple gave a presentation.  They met at a funeral service, he got her number but he did not call for five months.  The reason.  He was in another relationship, and was not ready to pursue this relationship that was not entirely over.  He had some serious explaining to do.  Eventually after a year the woman ended the relationship, frustrated at the lack of communication, and the signs of love she was seeking.  At that point he wrote her long letters, and pursued her, and worked to resolve the issues, and eventually they got married.<br /><br />Women seek love, men seek respect.  Women want relationships, men want sex and love, women want commitment, men freedom.  So men are sometimes reticent about getting into a relationship.  Eventually though, most guys want to settle down.<br /><br />I thought reading the book that the writer was interpeting these situations to match his own preconceptions.  The results of his admittedly small survey, 20 friends in relationships, about how they met, and who pursued who is unscientific.  I could easily talk to twenty people, with totally different results. You should be as proactive as you need to be to get the guy.<br /><br />If a guy won't meet you in person, if he does not return calls, if he has different other things going on in his life, which he plays up, if he doesn't want you to meet his family, if he's making excuses or maybe he feels an unspoken expectation of commitment hanging over him, if he has not introduced you to his friends, then let's face it, he's not that into you.  Ask what can you learn from this, so that you can do better next time.<br /><br />Ladies, judge actions not words, because men will spare your feelings yet actions are more revealing.  Ask a guy friend for his opinion.<br /><br />Guys, if you are dating a woman, and you are not that into her, let her go. You will set two people free to pursue the right relationship, and make four people happy ultimately.calls, if he has different other things going on in his life, which he plays up, if he doesn't want you to meet his family, if he's making excuses or maybe he feels an unspoken expectation of commitment hanging over him, if he has not introduced you to his friends, then let's face it, he's not that into you.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" is a revolutionary work in the cinematic medium and is considered by many to be the first film of the science fiction genre.  When released in 1927, it stood in stark contrast with American standards of filmmaking, which were mostly shot in open outdoor areas.  Rather than imitate nature, \\"Metropolis\\" consciously rejected it, with some of the most elaborate and complicated structures ever designed for a motion picture.  In doing so, Lang embraced the modernism of his era, in which mass industry continued to widen the gap between classes.  The films construction of the `man-machine' was an appropriate reflection on the times as well.  As technology was becoming something which people were growing increasingly dependant upon, the worker was transforming into an extension of the machines in which he or she used.  This mechanization and overall feeling of loss in ones own humanity is exemplified by the film's opening shots where the workers switch shifts and operate machinery in a robotic and calculated manner.<br /><br />\\"Metropolis\\" is often criticized for being overly exaggerated.  People need to take into account when the film was made and the specific context it holds within that particular time period.  Obviously, certain aspects of a work made so long ago may seem awkward to many, when it is being judged according to recent expectations.  Perhaps one of Lang's most amazing achievements lies in how well so much of the material has withstood the test of time and how incredible of an achievement it was back in 1927.  I would further argue that the films expressionism is actually the glue that holds it together.  Whether from the larger-than-life sets constructed in the Babelsburg films studios, to the fictional technology used to construct the `man-machine', the films expressionistic techniques have ultimately heightened the work and helped in making it the artistic achievement and critical success which it has come to be regarded as.

0553579908|5.0|I will start off by saying that the A Song of Ice and Fire series is my personal favorite fantasy series to date. With that being said, A Clash of Kings is the book that really brings a lot of intrigue to the series. <br /> <br />If you are a fantasy fan who craves action but does not enjoy an overruse of magic, this is the book and the series for you. A Clash of Kings is full of battles and these are realistic battles, something that is sometimes lacking from modern fantasy novels. <br /> <br />The main reason this book is set apart from its predecessor, A Game of Thrones, is that it introduces a vast amount of new point of views. If you are not familiar with the layout of these books, each chapter is told from the viewpoint of a different character. A Game of Thrones is a great book, don't get me wrong, but most of the point of views are members of the Stark family and the only real deviation from this are Tyrion's and Dany's chapters. A Clash of Kings has viewpoints that are all over the place, from the Wall, to King's Landing, to across the narrow Sea, and more. <br /> <br />The Seven Kingdoms are fragmented, with 5 kings reigning in the land. Each viewpoint gives us a look at the different kings and their retinues, which is a great plus.  One of the most interesting things about this book is that none of the \\"kings\\" has a point of view chapter; everything we hear about them is from secondary sources, be they Catelyn or Davos or whoever. <br /> <br />This is definitely fantasy for adults, however. There are sexual situations, including incest and prostitution. There is also a vast amount of death and gristly portrayals of these deaths.  <br /> <br />Still, this book is a masterpiece. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and is tired of reading the trash that Robert Jordan is putting out these days (books 1-4 were great but, come on, book 11?). A Song of Ice and Fire is a great fantasy series that must be explored if you are a fan of the genre.
006441034X|5.0|A wonderfully crafted fantasy filled with nuance and surprises.  No one is quite who or what they seem (sometimes literally), the bad guys have glimmers of humanity and the good guys are packed full of faults.  As soon as you finish reading it once, read it through again to pick up everything that you missed. <br /> <br />Sophie is the oldest, and therefore unluckiest, of the three daughters of a perfectly respectable hattmaker in a nice little villiage.  When her father dies, she resigns herself to a life of toil and stays in the hat shop to learn the trade.  Until, that is, a wicked witch puts a curse on her and she must go out into the world to seek her fortune.  Almost immediately, she runs into the moving castle of the very wicked Wizard Howl and decides that he can help her if no one else can. <br /> <br />If you saw the movie, be forewarned that this is a very different book.  Many of the characters are quite different, their motivations differ, even Sophie's curse is a little different.  The movie and the book are each very good in their own way, but try to come to the book with an open mind instead of expecting certain things to happen. <br /> <br />Diana Wynne Jones has been my very favorite author for the past 15 or so years (ever since I randomly picked up a copy of Charmed Life because the girl on the cover had a pretty dress), but she is just so prolific that I occassionally come across books of hers that I've never read.  This, I'm sorry to say, is one of them.  It is certainly one of my new favorites, and I recomend it to anyone who enjoys good fantasy writing and/or fairy tales turned on their heads.
B0002858YS|4.0|Probally the best album of 2005.The songs \\"somebody told me\\" and \\"Mr brightside\\" tie the whole album together. All the other songs are great, but those two songs are my favorite. A great sounding cd as well! For any IPOD owner definitely a must to add to your play-list, as the IPOD sound really showcases the vocals and rock'n sound! If you ask me, there one of the top 10 rock bands of 2005. You need to buy Hot fuss, a no brainer for anyone looking for an awesome gift or an excellent rock experience.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|For children, the approach of Christmas is a time of breathless anticipation.  For many adults, it is a feeling of slow strangulation.  There is no question that this is an adult Christmas film, best watched after everyone under about age 14 is tucked safely into bed for their long winter's nap. <br /> <br />Don't fill your eggnog glasses too full, however; because fifteen minutes into \\"Christmas Vacation\\" you'll be laughing so hard that you'll be wearing your Old English and J&B on your reindeer sweater.  Quite simply, this movie is the most side-splittingly funny film ever made about the American tradition of all getting together in one house for Christmas and driving each other nuts. <br /> <br />Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) is the focal point of the hilarity, caught as he is in a futile struggle to live up to his own impossible expectations about himself and his role as his extended family's new patriarch and benevolent provider.  The three sets of elderly grandparents who detest each other all add to his feeling of tension and pressure; and the uninvited appearance of cousin Eddy, his family and his snot-soaked dog in a moldering, ancient RV is the final jewel in this crown of comedic genius. <br /> <br />Add to this equation the whining teenage daughter, the ever-patient and eternally suffering son, the boss who doesn't even know his name, the Christmas bonus check that still hasn't arrived, and the 25,000 \\"Imported Italian Twinkle Lights\\" that simply refuse to light, (or twinkle,) and you have in Clark a man who is standing, as he howls at one point, \\"on the brink of Hell.\\" <br /> <br />Throughout it all, the exquisite and irreplaceable Beverly D'Angelo breezes around as Clark's beautiful and inhumanly loving and patient wife; proving conclusively that even being married to the perfect woman isn't enough to make a man happy when he expects the superhuman from himself. <br /> <br />With these ingredients and these actors alone, we have a potentially good, funny, interesting film.  There is, however, a third element that pushes this movie over the top and into the realm of true, timeless greatness; and that is the sheer love it has for the often burdensome cross of family. <br /> <br />I challenge you to watch this and not tear up at some point.  When Clark finds old 8mm film of his childhood Christmases in the '50's; when his father comes out to the laundry room to give him a loving word of advice; when the godd**n lights FINALLY come on.  These are just a few of the moments where I pretend my nose is stuffed up, and keep my face turned so that my tears are invisible.  This film genuinely loves Clark and his all-too-familiar family; and even though each heartwrenching moment is likely to be followed by an exquisite gag that will have you crying and choking at the same time, I challenge you not to love yourself and everyone around you (even your relatives) just a little bit more after watching this classic. <br /> <br />Merry Christmas.
0553213105|5.0|If you don't fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.<br /><br />Jane Austen's best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.<br /><br />Pay attention to Elizabeth's words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen.  There are many occasions where Elizabeth's character shines through.  She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself.  It is as if Jane said, \\"Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like.\\"<br /><br />Elizabeth is multi-layerd.<br /><br />What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen's ideal man.  He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there.  And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy.  Isn't it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?<br /><br />Also, pay attention to Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Bennet.  Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they?  Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant.  He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.<br /><br />Mmmm.  Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?<br /><br />Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy.  This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth.  We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine.  Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.<br /><br />I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.<br /><br />Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.her Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy.

B0002VL6YG|5.0|As far as complete cohesive the-whole-album-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-the-tracks goes, this album is definitely among the top 3 albums of the Eagles.  To be very honest, I didn't think much of \\"Hotel California\\" as an album although there were a couple of great singles on that album, as far as great albums in their entirety goes, that one fell short in my opinion and is highly overrated.  Not so \\"Desperado\\" though with it's great mix of country (\\"Doolin' Dalton\\", \\"Desperado\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\"),rock (\\"Outlaw Man\\") and even folk style ala Crosby, Stills and Nash (\\"Bitter Creek\\"), this Western/Cowboy outlaw theme album really scores big with really great tracks and now it comes in a mlps format with very good remastered sound as well.  This is my second favourite Eagles album after \\"The Long Run\\" and comes just ahead of \\"Across the Border\\" another great album by the way.  This version of \\"Desperado\\" is the best one there is out there with great packaging, great sound quality and great tracks, this is highly recommended.

The ending was just right.<br /><br />One hopes that Chevalier will do more of the same with other great works of art that she loves.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|That Ian Anderson and his band Jethro Tull should create one of the finest \\"traditional\\" Christmas albums ever? This from the performer who based his most enduring album Aqualung on a direct criticism and disavowal of organized Christianity? Notice the cover- there, outside the church, the little guy hopping around on his leg playing the flute...\\"Dharma for One\\".     But that is the nature of the best of Jethro Tull: not so much has Mr. Anderson been an \\"ideologue\\" (as stated elsewhere on this review page) but rather someone who, like a lot of us, and maybe despite ourselves, finds a kind of peace once we slog through all of our choices and pre- or mis-conceptions. All right...well maybe.    I don't presume to know where that place is for Jethro Tull, but I do know that the music on this disc is bright, clever and just jazzy enough to appease traditionalists and non-traditionalists alike. The darting flute and guitars are a Tull staple, and perfectly suited to this collection of Christmas music. The originals are surprisingly sweet and melancholy; the lyrics as ever smart and unexpected.     For those of us who have been Tull fans for a long time, the familiar embellishments and flights of fancy are especially sweet. Where on earth do you hear that mandolin played like on  \\"A Christmas Song\\"? I've never been to the Scottish Highlands, but I'll be darned if I don't see them when I hear \\"Another Christmas Song\\". But it isn't all sweet...isn't there just a hint of menace in \\"Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow\\"? But fret not- \\"Share your joy at Christmastime!\\"    Okay, 5 stars for Tull longstanding fans. 4 for the rest. I imagine those who can't see anything redeeming in Tull won't dig this either. Beats heck outta most of the other schlock rock Christmas albums out there. It ain't Brian Setzer but never shall the twain meet, I would think.
B000065U1N|4.0|This is a great war movie, packed with one of the best surround sound ever made for movies. Even just for testing your suround theatre system, this movies is a must see. Acting is overall good.  <br /> <br />One strong impression I got is that this operation is badly planned. The gerals have to be blamed. Their beucratic style in the movie made a point. The big mistake is that the leadership badly under-estimated the power of the warlords and the potential dangers out there. There is bad coordinatoion between the units too. It is painful to watch these brave soliders die in vain, due to a great part their officers' incompetence.
0780622650|3.0|Don't laugh at the title of this review.  \\"Lost In Space\\" is the perfect film to watch if you'd like a handle on how most motion pictures are made these days.  Take an old TV series, slick it with gee-whiz special effects, toss out the plot, and let folks munch on popcorn as they \\"ooohh\\" and \\"ahhh\\" at the wonders on the screen.  That's all that this film really is.  Has Hollywood run out of good, original ideas?  From the \\"Beverly Hillbillies\\" to \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" to \\"Starsky and Hutch,\\" we've been brutalized by the moviemakers with one TV rehash after another.  I've also seen a trailer for the new \\"Miami Vice\\" film.  What's next, the \\"Square Pegs\\" movie?<br /><br />Anyway, back to \\"Lost In Space.\\"  The story sounds like a really good one.  Using environmental destruction as the motivator in this flick, work-consumed William Hurt and his Robinson family are jettisoned off to Alpha Prime in order to design the Hypergate, which will allow humans to leave Earth at rapid speed to Alpha Prime, which is an inhabitable planet.  Of course, things go awry when Dr. Smith, sinisterly played by Gary Oldman, sabotages the mission and the family is forced to use their hyperdrive before the gate can be designed and they hurtle into unknown expanses of space and time.  This gives the family a bottomless pit of adventure to be thrown into.  Instead, we get ho-hum adventure that looks really cool on the screen but, in the end, is relatively nothing but fluff.  The ending leaves the film wide open for a sequel, though that will probably never come to fruition.<br /><br />The acting in this film is pretty good.  The best performances in this film are by Hurt, Oldman, and Mimi Rogers, who plays the mother of the family Robinson.  Matt Leblanc is very good as Major West, though you can't help but see dumb Joey from \\"Friends\\" in every scene that he's in.  I kept waiting for Ross or Chandler to come popping out of the scenery to bring Leblanc back to the ol' coffee shop.  Heather Graham plays Judy Robinson respectfully, but there's not a lot for her to work with.  The younger Robinsons, Will and Penny, are rather annoying at times.  Jack Johnson plays the forgotten young Will and Lacey Chabert scowls and hisses her way through puberty as Penny.<br /><br />This film is brilliant as far as visuals go.  The mere expanse of space in this film looked so great on the big screen when this originally came out that I often caught myself watching the scenery more than the actors.  The special effects were top-notch back in the 90's and they still hold up wonderfully today.  The Robinson family's spaceship, Jupiter 2, is designed beautifully.  The landscapes and even the famed robotic spiders are nicely rendered as well.<br /><br />The problems with this film are abundant, but if you can sit through trainwrecks like \\"Hulk\\" or visual buffets like \\"Independence Day\\" and still like yourself the next morning, \\"Lost In Space\\" will not be a total lost cause.  Like I said before, the plot is almost non-existent, but the special effects are some of the best in the business.  Unfortunately it seems that too much time was put into the effects and nothing else, just like most modern action yarns.<br /><br />In closing, I have to admit that I bought this film fully knowing what I was getting into.  The film just has too many cool whiz-bang effects to be ignored.  If you're looking for depth and character development, steer clear of this film.  But if you just want something to watch while your pounding nachos or popcorn into your face, this movie fits the bill.<br /><br />Lightly recommended to fans of sci-fi.  Fans of the original will notice a few nice cameos but will probably hate this film.  If you love films just for the effects, then this is one of the best flicks you can ever watch.aham plays Judy Robinson respectfully, but there's not a lot for her to work with.

0060765496|5.0|One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.<br /><br />This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.<br /><br />Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.<br /><br />The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.<br /><br />The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.<br /><br />This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.<br /><br />A grand story, and a great film!child's hope for the future.  <br /> <br />The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|\\"King Kong\\" is a good film.  It's one of the better movies to come out in the past year.  It is full of action, romance, and comedy.  It has a solid cast and a nice musical score.  The special effects are very good and the writing keeps the bulk of the story moving at a rather swift pace.<br /><br />With all of that said, I have to admit that there were a few things that I didn't really like.  The beginning of the film, including the introduction of the primary players and the trip to Skull Island, definitely would have benefited from a little more editing.  It's just too long.  Once the crew reaches Skull Island, however, the story picks up to a very nice pace with a couple of comedic and loving interludes between Kong and Ann Darrow to break the pace a bit.  The action is scattered amongst charging brachiosaurs, giant insects and natives.  The stampede scene does seem a bit overdone, but it is very fun to watch.  The battle between Kong and the T-Rexes also seems to suffer a bit from overkill, but it's put together so well that it's enjoyable to watch on the screen.<br /><br />Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are all good in this film, but let's face it, Kong is the star.  The CGI gorilla with a big heart is quite impressive on the screen, and his emotions flow smoothly and quickly from anger to hate to sadness and even fear.<br /><br />The outcome of this story is obvious.  Jackson pulls out no magic tricks for the big guy when he climbs that Empire State Building.  The ending is rather moving, but Black's Denham character sort of weakens it.<br /><br />In short, this is a very good action/adventure/romance in the old cliffhanger vein of the 30's and 40's.  It's also very obvious that Peter Jackson loved this film very much and put a lot into its development.  However, much like George Lucas went a little overboard with special effects in Episodes I, II, and III, I think that Jackson is guilty of the same thing here.<br /><br />I should state that the PG-13 rating is primarily for some rather gruesome death scenes on Skull Island.  There is a little language, but watching men get sucked to death by leach-like creatures may not sit well with younger viewers.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of popcorn adventure and, of course, Peter Jackson.  Just don't expect a tale as wonderful as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.  This film is sufficient, but don't let people carry you away with talk of awards.  This film may get a nod for music or even special effects, but none of the actors have enough to work with here to gain an Oscar.  Just know that if you like gorillas tearing up the jungle and a sizeable chunk of New York, you'll enjoy this film.te that the PG-13 rating is primarily for some rather gruesome death scenes on Skull Island.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is riding high (thankfully not on horseback), and the well-executed electronica/dance formula of her new album, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is indeed the culprit. Although her ambitious yet ultimately underwhelming 2003 disc \\"American Life\\" fizzled away soon after its release, it hardly forecasted her demise, for \\"Confessions\\" is a far more sturdy collection.<br /><br />Taking off with \\"Hung Up,\\" the Material Girl's 36th top-10 single, it is evident from the get-go that this album relies less on introspection than on sing-a-long choruses and frothy dance beats. Longer than its radio version, the track sounds even better stretched out to a majestic six minutes, until it blends into the hypnotic \\"Get Together\\" after a ticking alarm clock suddenly blasts. The pulsating track, which can best be described as an electronic freeze-out, will rub listeners in all the right places with its spare yet sexy lyrics and mercurial pace.<br /><br />The aptly titled \\"Let It Will Be\\" is a scintillating affair that takes the listener on an abbreviated ride on the roller coaster of Madonna's history, while maintaining the credo of its namesake. \\"Jump\\" and \\"How High?\\" follow the same self-effacement but delve deeper - beckoning listeners to make judgment calls about their own lives while still remaining personal. The former, which benefits from smoldering dance beats and a solid melody, belongs on the radio.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the vocoder-stuffed \\"Forbidden Love\\" is a slow-burning '80s throwback, while the pulsing synths of \\"Future Lovers\\" recall Donna Summer's disco classic \\"I Feel Love.\\" While delightfully retro, both songs are adventurous enough to suggest a futuristic sound. Fashioned similarly is \\"Sorry,\\" a tribute to those who simply cannot forgive.<br /><br />Other tracks include \\"Like It Or Not,\\" a blunt ode to self-sustenance, the tongue-twisting \\"Push\\" and \\"Isaac,\\" which reflects the diva's notorious interest in Kabbalah and contains Middle-Eastern chanting.<br /><br />The sole misstep on the collection is \\"I Love New York,\\" which has embarrassing lyrics and a choppy melody.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Confessions\\" is an infectious, high quality pop album that serves as yet another testament to Madonna's longevity. While it may not be as formidable as \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Like a Prayer,\\" it is a genuine gem.<br /><br />A deluxe edition includes an extra track, \\"Fighting Spirit,\\" a 40-page picture book, an 80-page journal book that includes some of Madonna's diary entries, and a one-month subscription to ICON, her fanclub.<br /><br />Last but not least, iTunes offers three different variations of the album, as well as assortment of club mixes of \\"Hung Up.\\"g. <br /> <br />The sole misstep on the collection is \\"I Love New York,\\" which has embarrassing lyrics and a choppy melody. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Confessions\\" is an infectious, high quality pop album that serves as yet another testament to Madonna's longevity.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|I loved this movie as a child.  It had a magical aura about it, with all of the crazy creations in the factory and the eccentric and fascinating Mr. Wonka. <br /> <br />This version is a good modern-day representation of the movie.  The sets are outstanding and creatively done.  The Oompa Loompas are slightly more disturbing in this version (which may have something to do with the fact that they're all played by a single actor), but they're entertaining.  There is a slight twist in plot in this version, as you get to delve a bit more deeply into Willy Wonka's childhood, but I feel it works within the story. <br /> <br />This movie certainly has the Tim Burton stamp on it.  Even if you didn't know he was the director, you would be able to draw similarities between the feel of this movie and his others such as Edward Scissorhands.  It's worth a watch.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|(from an earlier feature, copyright 2005 Michael F. Hopkins)<br /><br />If anyone thought that director Peter Jackson would<br />rest on the laurels of his grand success in adapting<br />Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS into three of the finest<br />movies ever made, this film will make them stop and<br />wonder anew. Jackson's long-awaited upgrade of KING<br />KONG is a superb motion picture, balancing wit and<br />tragedy, satire and sentiment, delivered with<br />rippling power and a passionate depth which will<br />not be ignored.<br />Bypassing the camped-up travesty from Lorenzo Semple<br />Jr. and Dino DeLaurentiis which stunk up the late<br />1970s, the Oscar winning scriptwriting team of Jackson,<br />Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens grow their story from<br />the original 1930s RKO classic; paying persistent<br />homage and respect, while filling out the story<br />even further. Where the original KONG was a product<br />of the Depression era, Jackson's KONG provides a<br />sharp perspective of those turbulent times, and<br />what such sheer desperation could drive one to<br />do.<br /><br />Those who complain about the film's 3 hour plus<br />length, particularly those who bemoan the film's<br />first hour need to watch the film, not their<br />stopwatches. Jackson's sense of pacing, so crucial<br />to deliver the lengthy RING cycle, serves him<br />well once more. KONG's pacing is brisk and fluid,<br />at times cutting as a pitchman's jive, at other<br />times as gentle as a precious moment quietly<br />shared. In a word, it smokes.<br />Further, the first hour is the all-crucial intro<br />of characters and motivations, which is a particular<br />point where Jackson, cast, and crew nurture the<br />original tale of thrill-seeking showmanship into<br />a saga of clueless adventurers running headlong<br />into their own worst nightmares.<br /><br />Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens bring this particular<br />point home with their broader look into the key<br />individuals of the steamship's crew. Instead of<br />one-spot bodies to be dumped over the cliff, we<br />are given a diverse array of characters which the<br />audience has a deeper stake in, whatever happens.<br />Even when the tale dangles the poignant thread<br />of Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart Of Darkness\\" as a<br />gaze into the myriad motivations at hand, we<br />have at least one spot which revels in an equally<br />unholy obsession borne straight from Herman<br />Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\".... or Clint Eastwood's<br />\\"White Hunter, Black Heart.\\"<br />While Thomas Kretschmann's Captain Engelhorn<br />paints a tougher, more wary seafarer than the crusty<br />depiction in the original film, the one to watch<br />most vividly is First Mate Hayes, a wise and<br />world-weathered sailor beautifully delivered<br />by Evan Parke. Of all on the ship, it is Parke's<br />character who knows exactly what's in store<br />for most of them, and warns young Jimmy<br />(a Jack London-like wayfarer brought home by<br />the fine talent of Jamie Bell) that what's coming<br />is no adventure full of derring-do, fortune and<br />glory to be had by all. Time and tragic trespass<br />prove the fatal accuracy of Hayes' words.<br /><br />Speaking of that very trespass, Jackson's wry depiction<br />of endangered indigenous people reacting to outside<br />intrusion vs. the pitiful minstrelsy of grass-skirted<br />\\"natives\\" selling doo-dah stereotypes on \\"The Great<br />White Way\\" is an ingenious set of scenes in themselves.<br />Between this and the weather-beaten compassion of Parke's<br />performance, Jackson, cast and crew directly address<br />the one great flaw in the original KING KONG, and<br />masterfully turns it around.<br /><br />However one may have expected the LORD OF THE RINGS<br />composer Howard Shore to provide the music here, the<br />ever-conceptual James Newton Howard delivers a<br />masterwork of a score. Able to turn motifs on a dime,<br />and keep the balance of the greater drama(s) at hand<br />at all times, this KING KONG score is one of the<br />all-time classics.<br />Already acclaimed for his epic scores for the penetrating<br />films of M. Night Shyamalan, and other standouts (such as<br />his rippling 2003 score for P. J. Hogan's definitive take<br />on PETER PAN), Howard is justly recognized as one of the<br />most multitalented of all film scorists. His occasional<br />quote of a Max Steiner passage from the original KONG's<br />legendary score is a dutiful riot! All in all, Howard<br />delivers quite an inspirational feat of composition,<br />all around.<br /><br />Alan Lee's design work, once more, is sheer magic. At<br />points, some of the Skull Island overviews touch upon<br />Frank Frazetta's legendary vistas, capped with Lee's<br />own touch of the substantially fantastic.<br />No faerie lands here, the ethereal eye of the highly-<br />acclaimed illustrator captures the dangerous allure of<br />the prehistoric jungle, rife with dinosaurs and assorted<br />crawling ghastlies which recall Jackson's earlier work<br />in the Horror field. With each peril, however, Lee,<br />Jackson and the remarkable team at WETA imparts the<br />presence of an unknown world; an unknown which is<br />needlessly disturbed in the name of Western financial<br />pursuit.<br />Just as aptly, the traps and hypocrisies of the Western<br />jungle are depicted with stunning detail. Hearing Al<br />Jolson sing about good times and lots of money, while<br />the film's opening unveils scene after scene of crippling<br />want, is as sharp a reflection of the tale's timeless<br />duality as one can get; a particularly special summation<br />of the times that this tale comes from.<br /><br />In this, Kyle Chandler, Adrien Brody and Jack Black<br />unveil a brilliant comment of the differing faces of show<br />biz, then and now. Brody plays a creative auteur entrapped<br />amidst corporate confinement and exploitation, while<br />Black captures the chummy-sounding personification of<br />okeydoke on the make, and Chandler portrays a Grade-B<br />leading-man hopelessly full of himself.<br />For all the bluster of Black's Carl Denham, or the<br />preening of Chandler's Bruce Baxter (a comment on the<br />original KONG's Bruce Cabot?), it is the quiet wisdom<br />of Brody's Jack Driscoll which rises to the occasion,<br />meeting each new danger with great courage. Needing to<br />come to grips with his own words, Driscoll will dare to<br />cross lethal terrain, and stand at the top of the<br />world to secure the well-being of one special woman.<br /><br />Let's talk about that woman. Naomi Watts is just<br />plain wonderful. To Ann Darrow, she brings the air<br />of naivete, gusto, wit and wide-eyed innocence which<br />marked Fay Wray's original portrayal of the role.<br />With this, Watts adds an astonishing depth in<br />projecting the despair of virtue besieged by the<br />despairing times of The \\"Great\\" Depression. Too,<br />with her uncanny ability to gain Kong's respect,<br />Watts certainly brings new meaning to the term<br />\\"Broadway trouper\\"! Small wonder that Ms. Wray,<br />just before she passed on in 2004, gave Ms. Watts her<br />personal blessing. A signature performance.<br /><br />Which brings us to the standout work of Andy Serkis.<br />If you think his body language was superb portraying<br />Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, wait until you see<br />his bravura performance delivering the unspoken<br />drives of the Great Ape. WETA's digital imagery does<br />the original's SFX wizard, Willis O'Brien, great honor<br />with their wondrous genius, but it is Serkis' gifted<br />physicality which brings the majesty and tragedy<br />of KING KONG so achingly home.<br />In turn, it is between Serkis' Chaplin-worthy pantomime,<br />and Watts' grasp upon the loneliness lurking beneath the<br />terror, that the saga's crucial bond takes firm hold here.<br />What ensues with Kong and Ann is not a lust misplaced by<br />menace, but the camaraderie of two lost souls; each facing<br />the abyss, shorn of illusions for a brighter future. What<br />comes from that bond is what makes this KING KONG so very,<br />very special.<br /><br />Now we wait for Jackson and friends to deliver THE HOBBIT!<br />Meanwhile, an image I will carry in my mind and soul, for<br />years to come, is that view from the Empire State Building;<br />looking into the vast, unknown horizon, for one loving<br />moment, without grief or fear...nding personification of<br />okeydoke on the make, and Chandler portrays a Grade-B<br />leading-man hopelessly full of himself.<br />For all the bluster of Black's Carl Denham, or the<br />preening of Chandler's Bruce Baxter (a comment on the<br />original KONG's Bruce Cabot?), it is the quiet wisdom<br />of Brody's Jack Driscoll which rises to the occasion,<br />meeting each new danger with great courage.

WETA's digital imagery does<br />the original's SFX wizard, Willis O'Brien, great honor<br />with their wondrous genius, but it is Serkis' gifted<br />physicality which brings the majesty and tragedy<br />of KING KONG so achingly home.<br />In turn, it is between Serkis' Chaplin-worthy pantomime,<br />and Watts' grasp upon the loneliness lurking beneath the<br />terror, that the saga's crucial bond takes firm hold here.<br />What ensues with Kong and Ann is not a lust misplaced by<br />menace, but the camaraderie of two lost souls; each facing<br />the abyss, shorn of illusions for a brighter future. What<br />comes from that bond is what makes this KING KONG so very,<br />very special.<br /><br />Now we wait for Jackson and friends to deliver THE HOBBIT!<br />Meanwhile, an image I will carry in my mind and soul, for<br />years to come, is that view from the Empire State Building;<br />looking into the vast, unknown horizon, for one loving<br />moment, without grief or fear...
B000058983|5.0|I'll make this as short as I can: <br />Forever Changes is unique, it's perfect, and it's essential. <br />Arthur Lee does not have the best voice in the world, nor are the rest of the musicians masters of their art. It's offbeat, but extremely listenable; it's incoherent at times, yet you'd be hard-pressed to find a more intregral, cohesive, and uniformly beautiful album. <br />It's been on my top 3 list for the past 35 years, and I own over 7,000 CD's, and listened to countless others. <br />If you're reading this, you're curious about Love. Rarely if ever will you read such definite and devotional accolades about any album. When music can provoke such reactions in so many people, you know this is no run-of-the-mill CD. <br />This album is in a class by itself. No comparisons, no peers. Period.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I went to see King Kong last friday, and I was totally impressed by this extraordinary vision of Peter Jackson. <br />I have always been a fan of the Kong myth ever since I first saw the underrated 1976 film, and later the 1933 original, and let me just say that this one is better than both, yes, even better than the original. <br />Peter Jackson has created a fantastically monumental masterpiece, which I'm affraid the average american moviegoer or film critic will never quite appreciate because of their blatant ignorance and superficiality. <br />This movie has some very fine points, hidden from these people, which make it much more than just another giant gorilla flick. <br />That's why there are many bad reviews about it, and it hasn't lived up to its hype in the box office (even though its still early to say), because it's not for the common, insensitive people. <br />The action is breathtaking and thrilling, but the true power of the film rests on certain details, that a lot of people will never understand, it made me remember my childhood, the women that I loved, and even the memory of my long gone pet Bouvier, in a way that no movie had ever done. <br />One of the best parts was actually trashed by these imbecile critics, the frozen lake sequence had something that made me happy and sad in an unexplainable feeling that translated into some tears. <br />It's much more than the age old tale of Beauty and the Beast, it's an amazingly powerful story that Jackson has conceived in such a manner that can only be appreciated through your heart and soul. <br />Thank you Mr. Jackson, you have done it again.
B00004SAAX|5.0|It is hard to express in words what an incredible achievement this is.  The immense feats of memory alone, demanding far greater efforts than sighted performers face, command our respect.  So does the consistent quality of Walcha's playing.<br /><br />Bach's almost mathematical absorbtion with fugue lies at the centre of his genius.  He was an organist first and foremost, an organist all his life.  Like Bach, Walcha is an obsessive controller who uses music to shape his world.  He treats each piece as a treasure to be cherished and burnished, and this makes him the greatest Bach organist since Schweitzer.  We are told that Bach would travel miles to hear great organists perform, and Helmut Walcha is just such an organist as those.<br /><br />The magnificent instrument used here is celestial in tone.  To those for whom Bach fugues conjure up images of Christopher Lee playing Dracula, or dull Sundays in church, here is one of the great achievements of Western civilization, a glittering pinnacle of Baroque art, performed by a great modern spirit, in one handy box.  You can't have Michaelangelo ceilings in your home, or Bernini bronzes in your living room, but by golly, you can put this on your stereo.
1400032717|4.0|I liked this novel. It's the type of novel you could probably read a second time, but I'd advise you read it in a day or two instead of taking several weeks because the pace of book is meant to be read this way. The Curious Incident of The Dog In The Night-Time is a novel that anyone can relate to. Young, old, even children because it deals with all types of issues from gossip to horror to mystery and beyond belief. This is an action packed book about a child who went through an odd life not like most people go through. Chris goes through obstacles and defeats his fears and overcomes all his odds. It is an amazing story that anybody should be able to read and love.
B0009OPO0S|4.0|I am a long time fan and I love this album.  I think once you listen to it a few times you will love it too.  I think you have to be a real fan to like it.  My friends all say it is not good becasue it is pretty mellow compared to her past albums which is true but I look past that.  There are a few fun track like the obvious, la tortura and my personal favorite las de la intuicion.  I think this cd could have used a few extra faster tracks but from what i heard on volume 2 i do not think she wants to go in that direction.  Over all it is a pretty good album to relax too.  The DVD is very fun too, it shows how she is on a personal level through the eyes of her own video camera and an awesome video, la tortura.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is BY FAR the best movie musical I've seen in a long time.  It's gorgeous in every sense, from the cinematic splendor to the star-studded performances and special effects.  The music is ten times better than the original Broadway cast in my opinion; Rossum (Christine) is stunning not only physically but vocally as well, and gives her character an inviting youthful exhuberance.  SUPERB in every way, period.

B000000H42|5.0|One of the most evil things ever created, it's just awesome! <br /> <br />The album is overflowing with satanic sounds and lyrics courtesy of King, check out these lyrics: \\"I denie Jesus Christ, the deciver and i abjure the Christian faith holding in contempt all of its work\\".  <br /> <br />How is he able to get his voice THAT high?  <br /> <br />The two guitar players (Denner and Shermann) are polar opposites but manage to blend together beautifully, Shermann plays evil, heavy as hell riffing while Denner goes for all out melody and harmonic acrobatics.  <br /> <br />I say if you don't mind the pro-Mestopholies lyrics and creepy atmosphere, you will find one of the most technically stunning guitar albums ever made, up there with classics such as Malmsteen's \\"Rising Force\\", Micheal Schenker's debut album or any other so-called \\"virtuoso\\" guitar-fest album.  <br /> <br />You can also classifiy it as one of the greatest vocal preformance albums, as King's voice is not on the same level as other metal vocalists, no, he is the equilivlent to most opera singers. Most metal vocalists try to make their voices as harsh possible, often resulting in less then proficient singing and even worse lyrics. King's voice is a remarkable work of art, his satanic cries and growls literaly have the ability to send shivers down peoples spines. <br /> <br />One of the few documents of recorded music that is worthy of a 5 star rating.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|I really love Shakira.  I think she is fantastic and I love this cd.  I think the songs are very good and for someone who loves her I think they will feel the same way I do when I say' \\"Where is the Shakira that we fell in love with?\\"  I mean this cd is not bad,  I love How Do You Do, and other songs on the cd.  But whoever said that this cd takes her back to her Donde Estan Los Ladrones? days was definately listening to the wrong cd.  Ther are no songs like whenever whereever, estoy aqui, pies descalzos, bruta ciega sordomudo, or ojos asi.  This cd is prety much a slow pretty boring album.  I like singers like Jewel and sarah mclachlan, so to me it is fine.  Honestly no one who is not a fan now is going to be a fan from this album and some of the fans looking for that lovable Shakira will not find her here.  I wish she would have added some more of her upbeat fun dance tracks on this cd but that is the way it is.
0060825219|4.0|I've returned once again to one of my favorite authors to review his latest work. Paulo Coelho of international fame for The Alchemist, 11 Minutes and The Devil and Miss Prym, has released his latest The Zahir. According to the book, the Zahir in Arabic means present, visible, incapable of being unnoticed. It is something that grabs our thought, mind and spirit and demands our full attention. It is believed to lead to either Holiness or madness.  In this book, the Zahir is a woman, an idea of a woman, a longing. Our main character sounds very familiar to our author; in fact our hero is a famous author now living in Paris, with his books being published in nearly every language. (which sounds like Mr. Coelho. This book is being published in 50 countries/languages this year alone. [...]) The author writes books that millions love, adore, and claim changes their lives. Yet he appears to have stopped living the type of deliberate life he writes about. He has settled into a complacent life.<br /> Then one day his wife disappears. Over time she becomes his Zahir; he writes a book about love and for a while the Zahir fades. Then he meets the man he believes she had left with and the Zahir returns.<br /> This is a wonderful story about becoming, and remembering who you were meant to be, not who you settled into. It will stir in you a passion to be more than you think you can be, and, to give more, and love more purely. Follow a man who goes in search of an estranged wife, only to find himself.
0440236304|5.0|This is the first book in a set of 4 books by the author, the books start with his training as a paratrooper in WWII, and follow his time in the war until he gets discharged after the war. The books in chronological order are 1)Currahee! 2) The Road to Arnhem 3) Seven Roads to Hell 4) Beyond the Rhime. By all means, read every one of them.<br /><br />For those who call WWII, the last \\"good war\\", this is a wake up. This war was just as full of horror and nightmare as any conflict, and the men treated as poorly. We get a view of the daily misery of the troops between the episodes of their bravery driven by the urge to kill or be killed. The author was a member of the newly formed Screaming Eagles 101st Airborne Division, and they made history and a reputation in this war.<br /><br />In this first book, Burgett takes us to his training as a 19 year old Paratrooper in 1944, and then on to England. The newly formed division gets the supreme test as paratoopers. Paratroops or Airbonre units are dropped behind enemy lines to shock the enemy, draw the enemy to them, diverting resources from the main line of attack so infantry and mechanized untis can move in. This may include seizing a key road or river crossing until the main units arrive. It is incredibly tough for them as they are often outmanned, outsupplied, and outgunned, facing tanks and artillery with nothing more than their own rifles, bazookas, and mortars they can fly in with. They are expected to do this for 1 to 2 days before relief arrives. But in Normandy, they were kept in action for seven harrowing days.<br /><br />This book series by Donald Burgett is the most graphic and honest description of being an active fighting soldier in WWII I have read and left a deep impression on me. Simple words and detailed memeories from a simple man. It is a great read, and I could not put it down.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a film of epic proportions! All involved in this project should be extremely proud of themselves. The film is an Ansel Adams photo come to life, yet with an emotional center that no previous \\"gay\\" film has ever had.  <br /> <br />Too many films have been made about young men coming out of the closet. There's almost a cookie cutter mold for creating these films. Maybe that's part of the reason that this film is so fantastic...it's not about coming out. It's about the far more realistic - not hiding, but simply controlling your feeling, burying your love and remaining \\"in\\" the closet. Good or bad, that is what many gay men force themselves to do. Is it bad? That's not for anyone but those men involved to determine. Is it detrimental to them and their lives? Again... <br /> <br />For Jack and Ennis (gyllenhaal and ledger), as cowboys in the early 60's all the way through the early 80's, coming out of the closet or even hiding in full view is just not an option. It \\"doesn't play\\" you could say.  <br /> <br />Oh, Jack is willing to take the chance - he's the risk taker of the two, but Ennis...no. Ennis knows what awaits them if they dare openly face their \\"dark\\" side. <br /> <br />So instead, for over twenty years, these two \\"straight\\" cowboys, each with a family of his own, meet clandestinely at the \\"scene of the crime\\" - at Brokeback Mountain for a week or so a couple times a year and they maintain their passionate love affair. <br /> <br />Are they gay? Are they straight? Are they hiding? Do they really love each other? I'm not going to tell you. That would be spoiling the film for you. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say, that no major studio, no major director, no major actors have ever tackled a film of this stature or magnitude. Oh, don't give me the crap about \\"Philadelphia\\". It was a cop out. Hanks and Banderas never kissed. They never related to each other. No, this film is the one that will forever be seen as the film that broke all the stereotypes that went before. It is the film that will be referred to in film history books as the one that broke down the walls. <br /> <br />Every actor in this film is firing on every cylinder. Ledger, who up until now, I thought was a light weight pretty boy, delivers a tour de force performance. He's the quiet, yet very much NOT the introspective man. He just doesn't have much to say. He swallows his words but you can see every thought as it rolls across his face. Ledger should have the best actor performance nailed. Gyllenhaal, too, delivers a performance of amazing depth and emotional range. His anger...his desperation... his loss... towards the end of the film, is palpable. Michelle Williams (Ledger's actual wife) as Ennis' wife cannot possibly be the same actress who played Jen on Dawson's Creek. No way. This actress is masterful and mature and you certainly can feel her pain. Her face tells the whole story. Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway also deliver absolutely phenomenal performances. This is a vehicle for some of the best performances you'll ever see on film - ever! <br /> <br />This is the film that lets the world know that even the most masculine of men can find deep within themselves an aching need that, no matter how hard they try, cannot be suppressed by playing it straight. These two men tried against all efforts to fit the mold society set for them. But as Jack says, \\"I guess ol' Brokeback really got us good.\\" They are bound to each other. <br /> <br />Does it have flaws? Yes. It's overly long. Twenty minutes could have been shaved off. However, with this film I'm beginning to realize why all of Ang Lee's films seem to drag on too long. He wants to take us along the road with each of his characters to the most complete of jumping off points. He wants us to fully understand them. Is it always effective? No. However, he is the director. And his past efforts are certainly example enough of how masterful this director is. I'll grant him his extra time so long as he continues to show us the true emotional center of characters, instead of relegating an entire character's reason for being to a single line of dialogue as many American films do. Lee's films are much more realistic and allow the audience to truly connect with the characters. <br /> <br />I'll be buying this film for certain. It warrants watching over and over (if nothing more than for figuring out what the heck some of the characters are saying from time to time). <br /> <br />Simply awesome!
B00000APLB|3.0|The Rolling Stones' \\"live\\" records have never been particularly outstanding.  Many point to GET YOUR YA-YA'S OUT and it is the best the Stones have ever done.  However, several other bands had overshadowed GET YOUR YA-YA'S OUT as \\"live\\" albums go in the early 1970's.  THE WHO LIVE AT LEEDS and THE ALLMAN BROTHERS AT THE FILLMORE EAST come to mind as prime examples.  Even Cream's WHEELS OF FIRE released two years before kicked the \\"live\\" Stones' butt.<br /><br />All that having been said, GET YOUR YA-YA'S OUT is still the standard against which all other Stones' \\"live\\" records are measured.  Unfortunately, GET YOUR YA-YAS OUT has a spark and fire that LOVE YOU LIVE does not.  For most of the record, the Stones sound tired and sluggish.  By the time you get to the end of the first disc, you don't have high expectations for the second disc.<br /><br />Nevertheless, things do make an interesting turn with the Stones doing a small set at the El Mocambo.  Well, almost.  You would think the Stones doing a blues set in the small confines of a clubhouse would be like shooting fish in a barrel; but you would be wrong.  \\"Mannish Boy\\", \\"Crackin' Up\\" and \\"Little Red Rooster\\" all sound underpowered and unimaginative -and doubts finally set in that the Stones may be all washed up.<br /><br />That is until \\"Around and Around\\".  Chuck Berry chords must kick some adrenaline into Keith Richards' veins because this is where LOVE YOU LIVE takes a quantum leap into the energy of a stampede of wild horses.  This song and all that follows is everything you could hope for in a \\"live\\" Stones' record.  Of course, choosing \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" to close the album is almost guaranteed to make a believer out of anyone.<br /><br />So where does this leave us?  Three quarters of a double disc set is uninspired while the last five songs lift the Stones on Olympian heights.  Well, I'm glad I have this album.  Granted, I skip the dross and go right for the gold every time.  Occasionally I give the rest a listen to see if I've missed something; but it all adds up the same.  So if you're a true Stones fan, get it and know what you're getting.  If you are new to this \\"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\\" stuff, pass this up for the real classic albums:<br /><br />1.) BEGGARS BANQUET<br /><br />2.) LET IT BLEED<br /><br />3.) STICKY FINGERS<br /><br />4.) EXILES ON MAIN STREET and (perhaps)<br /><br />5.) IT'S ONLY ROCK AND ROLL<br /><br />Build your Stones collection around these albums and you'll be the better for it.kip the dross and go right for the gold every time.

0743442539|5.0|John le Carre gives us a serious and gritty cold war era spy novel with \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\".  The main character is an agent  in Berlin who is recalled to London after his last contact is killed at the Berlin Wall. What follows is a spy plot that follows the main character through the depths of humanity and intrigue. This novel is so well written that you feel the emotions, paranoia, depression and anxiety  of cold war Europe in the 1960s. This is no James Bond novel: no sexy heroine, no fancy casinos and hotels, no witty phrases, no implied sex on a sunny beach. This novel is a hard core look at the spy business that pulls no punches and spares none of the innocent. This truely is the best spy novel ever written.
B0002EXH4A|2.0|What did he do??!!!!!!!!!! <br />Not only he started making bad music, he also managed to ruin his previous masterpieces.  Buy the original 'So far so good so what?' and 'Peace Sells' (both 5 star) and forget that these versions even exist.  <br />God... I can't believe this...one of my favourite album of all time treated as a commercial product with no respect but the man who actually created it. <br />Words can't even describe what I feel, but real Megadeth fans know what I'm talking about. <br />
B000BJS4SU|4.0|While this album is not original, no blues artist is really. The blues have always been a carbon copy of African Spirituals mixed with rudimentary instrumentalism. The blues genre does not have a large variety of sound or structure. It is, arguably, one of the most simple and formative styles of music, which does not leave a whole lot of room for artistic derision, except in the intricacy of a solo or refrain. The difference of style comes in the difference in guitar sound, the choice of notes. <br /> <br />What John Mayer is doing, is applying his blues knowledge and talent to his already established pop success. People love his pop lyrics and style, and most are unaware of his talent in playing the blues. What he is attempting with this album is to combine both capacities to keep the old pop audience and drag in a new audience of blues fans. It is an attempt to resurrect or conjure new blues fans in a new, popular form.  <br /> <br />Is it successful? Well, it's still a new experiment, but it's a good start.
B00005JO04|2.0|The film is nowhere near as good as Traffic, which is a very good film.  Syriana is full of gaping potholes and fuzzy motivations in addition to having a mess of a narrative structure.  More crucially, if you are looking for a good political film, Syriana fails completely as a thriller.  Harkening back to films like the very good Three Days of the Condor and the superb, mind-blowing Chinatown, the film assumes that our government is still acting in secret on behalf of big business, as if there were secret conspiracies driving our government that we don't know about.  Hello?!!  Former and failed oilman Bush openly invaded Iraq and we are still occupying it.  What conspiracy?  Everything is out in the open with Bush and his cronies.  If something criminal is leaked, like Bush signing an illegal order to allow spying on Americans without a court order, Bush just defiantly keeps doing it.  Syriana, which totally avoids Iraqiana, is very reassuring to the Right even though it intends to be a liberal film.  According to the film, the U.S. government (Congressmen and CIA) as well as oil men are TOTALLY in control and entirely successful at achieving their agenda.  There are a few good one liners and monologues in the film, but they are mostly in the trailer, which is far superior to this utterly disappointing film.   <br />

B000001ELF|5.0|Ok, So some say this is only an OK CD, but everything is just an opinion in our world. <br />This Is The Best Of the Kiss solo Albums The only other One you should bother buying is Paul Stanleys solo Album. <br />Now lets get to the review. <br />Rip It out- Nice way to start the cd off. Fast paced song. Lyrics are about a man who has been hurt buy his ex. Some of us can relate. <br />Speedin Back to my baby- I guess Ace decided He wasn't so upset with the girl. another great song But its just funny one song he is upset about losin the girl and the next he is speedin to get back to her. hahaha. <br />snow blind- great song I can't really say it any other way. great song. <br />Ozone- Nice opening, this is a song you kick back and do your thing of choice to. it makes me sway back and forth during a party. great song. <br />whats on your mind-Its an ok song. listen to the sample not the best song on the album <br />New York groove- Great song......Great..........great song. Has an almost hiphop style to it. Its not hiphop so don't get it confused but it could be remade into a hiphop song. nice beat pattern. <br />Im in need of love-this is another ok song like whats on your mind not horrible but not the best. <br />wiped out-classic song..this song is the Sh*t.. no other way of puttin it. <br />Fractured Mirror- This is an all instrumental Nice.........Its pretty good people overate it but its good. <br /> <br />well the only thing i can really say is buy this album if your an Ace or Kiss fan and don't worry about it havin only one good song on it. remember this is when music was good. its not modern day crap where you buy a nelly album and the only good song on there is the one on the radio if that. <br />peace
0792843584|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the complete version during its one week run at Cinema I in NYC in November 1980.  Running the same length but substantially revised and improved by Cimino for the VHS/CED/Laser versions released in the mid 1980s (and now on DVD)this is probably the version Cimino would have liked to have opened in November 1980.  It's what I would call a flawed masterpiece; a one of kind film made by a director reaching beyond his grasp.  The result is  pure picture making.  To those who say it is too long, or confusing; they should pay a bit more attention.  I've seen the film over 20 times and it becomes a richer experience each time I watch it.  There are no lose ends or editing problems; the issue being style.  As one reviewer wrote in 1980, Cimino chose the lyrical over the narrative.  By the way, the Sunday performance during which I saw it, Vilmos Zsigmond driving up from Phily where he was shooting Blow Out, also attended with his crew.  Once the film was over I heard applause from his section of the theatre.  Gene Siskel was also at that performance having flown in from Chicago to review the film.  As I left the theatre, glancing over I saw him busily jotting down notes.  I guess he was too busy filling out his score card to watch what had been up on that screen.  No applause from him.<br /><br />--Joseph Egan--
B0007O38F8|5.0|Let me first start by sayin all these people writing reviews on this cd are just hating, probably guess there favorite pop/rap stars aren't sellin like 50 is sellin. Let me say this...I listen to old school rock and some old school hiphop. and I don't mean old school like snoop and dre or tupac I mean old school like slick rick and Krs-one, Rakim, Run Dmc, sh&t like that. So I know real hiphop. Not too many artist out today are real hiphop. Take my list of none hiphop none emcees. Nelly, T.I., THat sad excuse for a rapper mr. snowman young cheesey. Oh i meant young Jeezy, Lil wayne. and the list goes on. Just cuase you got a hot record don't mean you have skill. Anyone can get someone on a hook singing a nice melodie and have a bangin beat but that don't make their lyrics grade a or even grade d. <br /> <br />ok enough with trying to convince abunch of stupid Teens who only like something cuase its with the in crowd. lets think for ourselves. <br /> <br />1) Intro- pointless <br />2) In My Hood- good song strong picture painting words, normal 50 style. <br />3)This is 50- Normal rap braggin on himself and how many guns he has but still some nice lyrics, good beat. <br />4)Im supposed to die tonight- One of the best songs on here. Em on the beat but the lyrics are banging. <br />5)piggy bank-Another great diss record, the only problem I got is why does 50 have to call out a legend like Nas, Sorry 50 leave it alone man before you get ethered like Gay-z. fat joe and jada who are wack anyway. <br />6)gatman and robbin- This song is probably one of the worst on the album. it doesn't fit in with the record at all. it belongs on eminems album. not bad just not 50cent. <br />7)candy shop- what can I say the ladies love it. but I am personally tired of all the \\"Club Bangers\\" people put out to sell records not that some of the lyrics are decent, this was clearly made for a single nothing heart felt. <br />8)Outta control- Nice song its 50cent doin his thang,nothing spectacular. <br />9) Get in my car- Hi tek on the beat you know this beat is fire. Now fif comes threw with the regular hiphop formula now days which is girl i got this and we can do that. but he also takes a stab at vivica fox. <br />10)ski mask way-classic g-unit robbin steallin killin ya know it ain't nothing spectacular. <br />11)a baltimore love thing-This song is smart. ITs about heroin. fif plays the role of the drug and he basically just writes a love letter to a fiend. great story telling ability shown here. great song. classic song. a song to remember. <br />12)Ryder music- normal modern day hiphop song. drugs guns girls cash. ya know how they do it. <br />13) disco inferno- ya all know this song so i won't speak on it form your own opinon but don't shy away from this ablum because of this song. <br />14)Just a lil bit- yall know this one too but I like this club banger. its got some nice harmony to it. <br />15)gunz come out- you can imagine what this is about. <br />16) my toy soldier- probably the stand out of this song is tony talk of new york yayo. this is probably the only song he ever wrote that i like. With lines like waves in my head lookin like a tsunami. for that alone i say you will like this song. fif doesn't shine much on this one but its still one of the best songs on the album just for yayos verse. which says alot cuase yayo sucks. <br />17)posistion of power- its an ok song fif brags about his money. thats it. <br />18)build you up-another love song with jamie foxx. tell me why mr. fox is trying to make records somebody please. he needs to quit acting and quiting makin records especially with the loud mouth out spoken egotistical Konman kanye west. they both blow. <br />19)god gave me style- This song I don't know what to think it is good lyrics are strong but it just seems like a filler track. <br />20)so amazing- Another track huanted by olivia awful singing. why did fif sign her onto g-unit. bad move and i bet her album sells less than the talkof nys did. <br />21)I don't need em- Good way to finish off the album. this song is strong and to the point basically its fif giving everyone the finger. but the beat is nice the and his flow is tight. <br />bonus track. <br />hate it or love it remix. well i hate it. Lloyd banks did get to shine very much but buck and yayo got their time in there. oh another thing the game is wack so don't expect to hear another documentary ablum from him cuase that album was only good cuase dre produced it. <br />Now i see a problem in hiphop albums there are way to many songs on the albums now days and most of them could have been canned. <br /> <br />well i hope you enjoy my review as it is the only review that is actually a review on this page. <br />
0307276902|5.0|I have read 3 of Oprah's book club picks ( East of Eden, Anna Karienna, and The good earth) I liked East of Eden and Anna Karriena but they where not great. Then I dicided to pick this book up becouse everyone was telling me it wasa great and they where right. When I first started to read it I could not believe what I was reading at times I could not read forrward becouse it was to hard to, then at times I felt like crying. The book is so powerfull and real it's imposiable not to get hooked. The book's about James a crack head, drunk and a lot more going into rehab and meeting diffrent people like Lenord, Lilly and more and his acount in his stay. He writes about what it's like to go through not having drugs or a drink of alchol. He tells us stories of his life and what he did wrong and we see how his parents deal with it. The book is good to read if you think your life is messed up read it and you wll aprechate everything you have. the book alos shows true love and how people will stick with you through the best and worse parts in your life. The book is beautifully written and dosent drag on at parts like some books do. Overall a must read for everyone it's one of the best books ever!!
B000002UAU|5.0|At the time of the initial release of Sgt. Pepper, there werw NO SINGLES released from this album, yet almost everybody knows every song. What else needs to be said?.....
B00000DHZJ|2.0|The selection is weighted towards his earlier Jimi Hendrix Experience pieces and when possible, shorter versions of the songs are given.  There is a good sampling of those here, but the sound quality is overall very flat.  This is not an especially well remastered recording and if you want to get a sense of how broad and complex a sound this musician was capable of producing you might well look elsewhere.  If you just want something to download onto your IPod, this might do it, but it is generally a disappointment and not up to the task.

0740748475|5.0|My gawd this book is heavy!  I love it though.  Without question, Calvin & Hobbes is my favorite comic strip of all time.  When I was a teenager and young man in the late 80s, early 90s, reading the daily Calvin & Hobbes strip was part of my daily routine.  And I still remember how depressed I felt when the last original strip was published at the end of 1995. <br /> <br />What makes Calvin & Hobbes so great is that it is so consistently laugh-out-loud funny.  Every page of these books gets a laugh out of me.  You look at most of the comics in the newspaper and you just can't say the same about them--at best you might get a chuckle, but you never laugh out loud. <br /> <br />The quality of this collection is actually better than what I expected after reading the other reviews here.  I'm quite happy with it.  I like the \\"scrapbook\\" appearance of the pages--they look like someone has cut out the strips from the paper and glued them onto the page.  It's a nice optical illusion, and I keep touching the pages expecting a change in the texture of the paper, but it's only an illusion. <br /> <br />In a phrase, I love it, and anyone who was a fan of Calvin & Hobbes will love this too.
B00006M183|5.0|I love this album because it's repeatedly enjoyable. Like all great albums, the more you listen, the more you receive. As soon as you cozy up to Save You, with its machine gun charm, you realize that Love Boat Captain, the song following, is stuck in your head and won't get out. This songs chokes me up. All You Need is Love, you bet.<br /><br />These are my favorites on the album, but I love almost all of the songs..almost all. I just seem to have a problem with Eddy's talking stuff. Each album seems to contain a ramble that sounds like reincarnated Dylan (oh, wait, he's alive). Bush Leaguer has sentiments I can agree with, but I'd just rather read the stuff on a lyric sheet or something.<br /><br />But enough about that. This album grows and grows on me. The fact that I at first found it lacking seemed to guarantee that it will be a favorite.<br /><br />Thank you again, guys. I swear, you keep developing and getting better!
B000B8QF14|5.0|This Cd is simply AMAZING! It Proves That Green Day are a Brilliant Band If they Can Performe to that Standard Live.The DVD is Pretty Cool Aswell.Get this Cd it is a FANTASTIC buy
B000BJS4SU|5.0|If you're looking for fresh and honest music, look no further. In the days where rap, r&b and hip hop are in domination, it's nice to know that John Mayer has given us devoted \\"real\\" music lovers something new to listen to.  <br /> <br />Definitely a must have. <br /> <br />

B00005JLF5|4.0|The many gritty, involving science fiction dramas that have cropped up in recent years- shows like the new Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, the various Stargate entries, etc., etc, probably owe a lot to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, one of the first of the edgy SF programs of the modern era.  As such, there is much to appreciate here.  Just be aware that DS9 (especially the first couple of seasons) may seem a little tame and sedate compared to the many similarly-toned series that followed in its footsteps.<br /><br />Also, just looking at DS9 as a Star Trek show, the usual caveat applies: as the characters haven't been fully fleshed out in the initial episodes, there is a tendency on the part of the writers to trot out those oft-used Trek plot devices to keep things moving until more character-driven plots could kick in.  So, in this inital set, you have to sit through a few too many of those somewhat tedious \\"crisis of the week\\" or \\"disaster of the week\\" types of stories between the handful of really good episodes.  Of course, once the Dominion War (a DS9 \\"crisis\\" that wasn't tedious at all) takes center stage during later seasons, then long stretches of the show surpass so much that has been on TV before or since.<br /><br />So, my recommendation is to enjoy this perfectly okay first season with its only occasional glimmers of greatness, while reminding yourself that your patience will be rewarded with the really good stuff in later episodes.  Finally, the DVD extras in this Star Trek set are generous, well organized, and interesting.
B00006LLNU|4.0|i feel kind of bad writing this review and only giving it four stars, because i haven't fully digested any of the songs past number three. I have listened to the whole CD a couple times, but none of the songs except those three have really stuck in my head and all that. All the songs on here are great and are defidently worth memorizing, but i personally havent yet. But i felt compelled to give this review anyway. <br /> <br />I first heard of this band on a commercial for a CD of theirs on MTV2 a couple years ago. It was probably this CD, but i have no way of knowing without seeing the commercial again. This band is truly one of a kind. They can summon these huge instrumental symphonies with just guitars, keys, bass, drums, vocals, and various other sounds that pop up at the right time. The songs have a central melody in all of them that all other intruments and aspects are at the mercy of, and it gives it a very neat quality. The music is very serene and is the musical interpretation of looking out a window and seeing a gentle yet huge snowstorm happening before your eyes as you look out at a forest-type landscape. It is truly captivating, and very moving. Every melody on this is completely stellar, and by stellar i mean amazing, 10/10. The vocal melodies are great, the guitar melodies are great, the piano melodies are great. The singer is very Thom Yorke inspired, as he sounds a lot like him at at times, but i don't look at the guy from Sigur Ros as a rip off as he has his own thing about him. The central guitar melody that drives the second song is one of the best soft, clean guitar parts ive ever heard, and the piano melody that drives the third song is one of the best piano melodies i've ever heard. If you wanna hear great music with an emphasis on melodic brilliance, and can get past the fact that the singer sings his amazing melodies in a foreign language (i think it is nordic, but ive rea that the singer sings in some language called \\"hopelandish\\", which surpirised me a lot. Someone please point out \\"hopeland\\" on the globe for me)then you will be truly pleased.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />There are some bands and some CDs that can completely, truly, and fully express an emotion or thought or idea. The releases by super insane speed kingpins Strapping Young Lad perfectly personifies true chaos, Van Halen and Limp Bizkit truly reflect true fun, Amnesiac by Radiohead truly personifies real loss, U2 truly express a true and fresh sense of wonder that comes with being a person on this planet,  and this untitled CD by Sigur Ros truly expresses serenity. Buy this and hear things as you see them at this time of year (for people who go back and read this review, i am writing this in Winter of 2005, Christmas Day is exactly one week). By the way, another CD that does a fantastic job of sonically representing the hopeful and occasionally sad side of winter is O.K. Computer by Radiohead. It is SUCH a winter sounding CD
B00005JO1Y|5.0|...to-be-a-classic! I must say my expectations were rather high, well, it was even better! And I'm no Peter Jackson-maniac, not at all -but I must say that the man with his taleneted crew knows how to entertain and move their audience. Even those who are familiar with the story of King Kong will sit tightened to their seats. The action-scenes are fantastic, the atmosphere of the movie capturing (it really is so exiting!), it grabbed my attention from the start -and held a tight grip until it was finnished, and I didn't want it to end actually. The only negative thing is that, well, \\"King Kong\\" has a tearwet ending. Indeed. But it's not a bad thing -don't get me wrong now, it's just that it kind of stays with you for a while afterwards, at least if you're of the easily-touched kind -and I guess I am. <br /> <br />See this movie! I guess there's not much more to say! Bravo!
B00005J6T0|5.0|True Blue is a great album, and presents some of Madonna's biggest hits. The best songs on it are \\"Open Your Heart\\",<br />\\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"White Heat\\" and \\"Love makes the world go round\\". Amongst the two singles Open your heart and Papa don't preach are \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"True Blue\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\".<br />Most of the album is lisenable apart from the throw away track \\"Jimmy,Jimmy\\". Overall it's a great album, and Madonna really evolved on this album. Two great remixes are included on this remastered version of True Blue.<br />Track by Track rating.<br />1. Papa Don't Preach.<br />This is a good song for Madonna, and an essential madonna hit.<br />This track is very well known. It has a good beat and is very fun to listen to. 5/5<br />2. Open Your Heart.<br />This is one of Madonna's greatest hits. The album version is great, but check out the 12 inch remix because it is even better. Probably my favourite Madonna track after \\"Like A Prayer\\" this one has got to be the albums best track. 5/5<br />3. White Heat.<br />This song is equally as catchy as Open Your Heart and is a great pop song for this album. It could have probably been a single. It has a bit of monolouge at the beginning but is a great song. Like Open Your Heart it is very 80's sounding pop music. Makes you want to get up and dance. 5/5<br />4. Live To Tell.<br />This was one of Madonna's first serious ballads, and many people said it was her most beautiful song at this point in her career. It is quite a nice song, and fits in well with this album. Another hit. 4/5<br />5. Where's The Party.<br />This song was O.K. but I didn't find it particually catchy. This song sounded as if it belonged more on \\"You Can Dance\\", but I am glad they included it on the album. It is an attempt at a dance track from Madonna. It doesn't sound too bad, but it doesn't sound great either. 3/5.<br />6. True Blue.<br />This is the albums title track and is quite catchy, but does sound a lot like a song by a 60's girl group. I guess that's how it's supposed to sound. This was at the time another big hit for Madonna. Like Open Your Heart you may not instantly recognise the title, but you will recognise this song when you hear it. 4/5<br />7. La Isla Bonita.<br />This is a good song. It's probably one of the best latino sounding songs from the 1980's i've heard. It is full of rhythm and will make you want to get up and dance. This song is the most similar song to \\"Who's That Girl\\". It was also a big single from the album. 4/5.<br />8. Jimmy, Jimmy.<br />Like \\"Where's The Party\\" this song did not really catch my attention, and even though quite catchy at points this song was one of the albums filler tracks. Nothing rememberable. 2/5<br />9. Love Makes The World Go Round.<br />Some people found this song annoying, but I like it. It is a good song with an important message and I feel it is a better party track then \\"Jimmy, Jimmy\\" or \\"Where's The Party\\". It has a lot of latino flavour, and is quite energetic and good to dance to. Not a bad song. 4/5<br />10. True Blue - The Color Mix.<br />This is a colourful remix of the song ( as it's title implies ) and is better then the original. Warner Bros made a good choice including this track on the remastered version of \\"True Blue\\" 5/5<br />11. La Isla Bonita - Extended Remix.<br />Once again just like the True Blue remix this song has more beat then the original and is a better track. It has an extended intro and outro where the beat builds up and extra instrumental parts in it, and the beat is heavier. 5/5.<br />The sound quality of this album is great and differs in no way to any of todays albums. The cover Art is also fully restored to all it's glory, and is the exact same as the 1986 L.P. cover art.<br />Overall this album is worth the buy if your a fan of Madonna, and is one of her most vibrant and colourful works, churning out plenty of hits.e another big hit for Madonna. Like Open Your Heart you may not instantly recognise the title, but you will recognise this song when you hear it. 4/5  7. La Isla Bonita.  This is a good song. It's probably one of the best latino sounding songs from the 1980's i've heard. It is full of rhythm and will make you want to get up and dance. This song is the most similar song to \\"Who's That Girl\\". It was also a big single from the album. 4/5.  8. Jimmy, Jimmy.  Like \\"Where's The Party\\" this song did not really catch my attention, and even though quite catchy at points this song was one of the albums filler tracks. Nothing rememberable. 2/5  9. Love Makes The World Go Round.  Some people found this song annoying, but I like it. It is a good song with an important message and I feel it is a better party track then \\"Jimmy, Jimmy\\" or \\"Where's The Party\\". It has a lot of latino flavour, and is quite energetic and good to dance to. Not a bad song. 4/5  10. True Blue - The Color Mix.

1400032717|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book. I thought it was original, smart, suspenseful, and resourceful. I think it's very effective in the way it portrays the behavior problems, emotional problems, and thinking patterns of autistic people. It its well written and the descriptions and diagrams are excellent.
B000002BMV|4.0|In the office I worked in back in 1982, I was the only black girl, and I worked with three other white girls who LOVED Journey.  I remember when they came to Cleveland, there was nothing that was going to keep them from going to the concert to see them.  I had never heard of Journey - wasn't into them.  One night, I was at home and turned on MTV, and there was the video playing on this band that the \\"girls\\" in my office was so gaga over.  That was the night I feel in love with Journey.  Oh, how I loved the sincerety of Steve Perry's voice - as well as the musicianship of the band as a whole.  Who's crying now!  I turn that song up loud every time I hear it - an era of bands that's long gone goodbye.....
B000001FMX|5.0|i just think that in all my years as a human...i need them now...and i need a jet black dusty wig to put on and shake, <br />and i need to start performing on a stage somewhere...now. <br /> <br />i can play these songs and only listen to this mad voice. and i can play these songs and listen to a screaming guitar made from my left rib.  <br /> <br />i can't win....i am forever lost to the new york dolls....y'all. <br /> <br />if you don't want to be lost don't buy this album.
B000641ZA4|5.0|If you were an avid watcher of MTV back in the '80s when it was still 'music television', there was no way to escape watching at least one, two or more Genesis videos during the day. The band was riding high during their second wave of success (post-Peter Gabriel) and they embraced making music videos wholeheartedly.<br /><br />With MTV and VH1 now seeming to show less music and more 'trash' (reviewers opinion), the \\"Genesis Video Show\\" DVD is a huge welcome treat and is a must for the avid Genesis fan.<br /><br />The collection spans the years 1976 to 1997 and includes every music video the band ever made during their career. It also shows the many sides to the band's personalities displaying humor (as with \\"Illegal Alien\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\", \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Anything She Does\\" and \\"Land Of Confusion\\"), intimacy (\\"Hold On My Heart\\", \\"Follow You Follow Me\\"), seriousness (\\"Mama\\", \\"No Son Of Mine\\", \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\") and pure musicianship (\\"Abacab\\", \\"Ripples\\", \\"Home By The Sea\\").<br /><br />The sound and picture quality of the DVD is amazing bringing out the music in a stunning new mix (courtesy of long-time producer Nick Davis) with crystal clear images. There are also individual credits for each video that can be displayed by hitting the start button on your DVD remote before the actual video begins.<br /><br />While the \\"Genesis Video Show\\" is a near perfect display of all the Genesis videos, there are a few downsides to the collection. First of all, the band's early days with Peter Gabriel are sadly underrepresented on this DVD - the 1999 version of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" being the only Gabriel track here. While the band did not make any commercial promo clips or videos during the Gabriel-era, it would have been nice to have seen a vintage concert clip or two from this period. This also would've given a more complete picture of the band in this collection.<br /><br />The second flaw (which is a big one in this reviewers opinion) is in the video for \\"Man On The Corner\\" which was taken from the 1981 Abacab tour. The true version of the video is a live performance with the band actually playing the song on stage in real time. For the version on this DVD, the original picture is maintained but the studio album version is heard in place of the actual performance. This creates an awkward experience while watching this video because Phil's lyrics in the live version don't always match that of the studio version. Why this was done this way is a mystery and the video should have been left as is with its original live track in tact.<br /><br />Apart from these flaws, the \\"Genesis Video Show\\" is a fantastic journey down memory lane and is a great collection of videos from this most-loved band. Buy this DVD, sit back and enjoy the ride. It'll be like living in the '80s all over again.ner\\" which was taken from the 1981 Abacab tour.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|just watch it and you'll see why it's one of the highest rated dvds on amazon.
B000301YY8|1.0|I don't like this dude.  The song Beautiful is so overplayed on the radio and it's so boring, that if I hear it again, it will be too soon.  A friend had this cd in their car the other day and the stuff I heard was also boring.  I wouldn't buy this.  I'd be looking for something a little less likely to put me to sleep.  His voice is weak and annoying and I'm sorry - it's just not that good.
6302212529|5.0|THE LITTLE MERMAID is the first movie I ever remember owning. Since then,I've watched a good dozen times, and it still gets me every time. I still howl with laughter at the antics of Sebastian and Flounder(he's so cute!), sigh romantically as Ariel sings to Eric on the beach(ARIEL RULES!!!!), boo(then cheer later)at King Triton, and shudder as Ursula makes her plans for \\"triton's undoing\\"! The wonderful music and lyrics by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken make me dance around singing. It belongs with all the classic Disney films. All in all, a wonderful film.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|This was back in the day that Whitney was at her peak.  She has gone off the rails slightly in the past couple of years, but this dvd highlights all her excellent work in the past.  As someone who has always loved her music, it's great to have all those favourites with a video to match.  My all time favourite Whitney song is Didn't We Almost Have It All.  Thankfully it's on here along with so many other great hits.  I highly recommend this DVD because it's nice to remember a 'Great' in the height of a career, than to see them in the slump they may presently be in.
