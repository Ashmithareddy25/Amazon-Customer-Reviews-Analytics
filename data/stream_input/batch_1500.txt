B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Santana's instrumentals are heady to say the least, and Shape Shifter is no exception.  I think it was Carlos who said he was \\"looking for that one (perfect) note,\\"  and in my opinion, he keeps finding it in many different ways.  As for the currently popular string theory, his music definitely strums my chakras.  I only recall one vocal, and it is beautiful.  Thank you Carlos and band for another great album.

The only thing that i would change would be the prices of some store items, like characters, because it takes forever just to get a couple thousand coins. But overall, this game is amazing, and it is an app that everyone should enjoy.
B007LE2VDM|4.0|A Thousand Years was a song that, despite its Twilightiness, stood out to me among the hit radio fluff. You don't find many songs on the radio anymore that you'd describe as \\"sad\\" or \\"delicate\\" - they are almost exclusively dance club beat-heavy songs or Adele-like voice blasting - but here in A Thousand Years there was a song appealing enough to break into the popular mind, despite looking rather out of place next to your Pitbulls and your LMFAOs.<br /><br />I watched a couple of interviews with Christina and came away mildly impressed and more than mildly fond. She has a tattoo for Johnny Cash(!), and she grew up loving the music of Fiona and Alanis(!). Clearly she has good taste. Plus she seems funny and sweet-in-that-tough-Italian-way, someone I'd like to be friends with.<br /><br />Christina's voice is always lovely, but she sometimes, for brief moments, strikes notes that are just mind-sexingly gorgeous. It sounds like waves of sadness and hurt and longing are merged and condensed and released as a perfectly feminine harmony.<br /><br />Okay, now for the criticism: Put bluntly, musically, this album simply isn't very good. That's not necessarily an insult because it doesn't seem to even be trying to be good. It seems instead that it's just trying to provide some harmless background instrumentation for Christina to sing on top of (which, of course, she does well). But it's disappointing to me that someone who idolizes Alanis and Fiona wouldn't try to do more musically. I don't want to accuse her of writing her music in a way that is sufficiently simple and sufficiently adolescent to be eligible for Glee or Twilight fame, but it almost seems like that's what's happened. If that's the case, I find it pretty seriously heartbreaking because those moments of vocal mind-sexery imply that we could be missing out on a remarkable musician.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Update 6/27: I am updgrading from 3 stars to 4 because three of her songs are more interesting than I initially realized: \\"Arms,\\" \\"Miles,\\" and \\"Tragedy.\\"ially realized: \\"Arms,\\" \\"Miles,\\" and \\"Tragedy.\\"

B007J4T2G8|4.0|[[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />Although there were many moments that my toes were curled (must be my Catholic upbringing)I love a good love story.<br /><br />Yes it was very erotic (learned more than I wanted about eroticsim)but, it had a basic story that was different from the normal story that becomes very boring.<br /><br />I looked forward to under standing why someone could have these kind of needs and how another seemingly virginal person would withstand and eventually crave the needs of this type of person.<br /><br />It was a story that was against all my beliefs, but I was drawn to want to understand this person who's needs were so foreign to me.<br /><br />I read the trilogy and even though it was so graphic,(not my ordinary read) the story was well told and the story line held me.  It was sometimes hard for me to go into the depths of erotisim, but I think that it is real in our world too, although not in everyone's world. The now generation is much more real and graphic than the world I was born in to. Good or bad...I don't know for sure.  Maybe it depends on the person who delves into this type of reality?<br /><br />The culmination of these books was a true romance with a lot of spice ( maybe I needed a bit of spice in my life!) I thought it was very evocative.  I was left was alot of thoughts of how did they do that?...<br /><br />I enjoyed these books when I wasn't too red in the face to read it.  A good read.<br /><br />Hope those who read these has an open mind.<br /><br />Not porn exactly, but certainly not for everyone!
B0081HLM2E|4.0|Headhunters (Hodejegerne) is a taut Norwegian-German thriller that, in its best parts, is reminiscent in style not only of the Coen brothers but also of Alfred Hitchcock as well.  Directed by Morten Tyldum and adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg from the novel by Jo Nesbø, Headhunters starts off casually with what seems to be an art thief explaining why he does what he does.  But just when you think you know what's going on and where things are heading, the film starts taking one unexpected turn after another, methodically ratcheting up the tension and the stakes, until you, like the art thief, are wondering just what the hell you've gotten yourself into.<br /><br />Set in current-day Oslo, Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is one of the top professional headhunters in Norway, assisting top-name companies find the very best in executive talent.  It's a good job and it pays well, but unfortunately not well enough to support the extravagant lifestyle Roger lavishes on himself and on his wife of seven years, Diana (Synnøve Macody Lund).  Which is why Roger is also one of the top art thieves in Norway; he needs the money to keep up the lifestyle that his regular job cannot support.  He freely acknowledges, in his inner narrative to the audience, that he's probably compensating for the fact that he's short (1.68m or 5'6\\") and ordinary-looking where his wife is tall and beautiful.  And because of his insecurities, he's constantly giving her expensive gifts - like financing the new art gallery she's opening - but stubbornly ignoring the one thing she really wants from him: a child.  But at the same time he's also having an affair with a woman named Lotte (Julie Ølgaard).  He knows it's probably a bad idea, but his doubts about his wife's love leave him in need of still further validation.<br /><br />Fortunately for Roger, his work with top-name companies and high-level executives is always bringing him into contact with the kind of people who like to indulge in expensive art, so he is able to use his day job to find suitable targets for his secret sideline.  He also has a valuable if distinctly unrefined partner named Ove Kjikerud (Eivind Sander) who works for the home-security company that most people use and who can enable him to get in and out of the target houses without triggering the alarms. The pressure of maintaining this lifestyle, however, is enormous, and so Roger must constantly pull one job after another, pointing out how the theft he pulls off early in the film won't even cover this month's mortgage payment on his expensive house once the middlemen take their cut and his partner Ove gets his cut. So he's excited when a juicy double-plum suddenly drops right into his lap.<br /><br />Roger's current big client is a hi-tech security company called Pathfinder who is looking for a new CEO.  And so when, at his wife's gallery opening, she introduces him to a man named Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), he quickly realizes that Clas, a former special forces commando and security expert who until just recently was working as an executive for Pathfinder's biggest rival, is the perfect match for the job.  And when he finds out that Clas is apparently in possession of a lost Rubens - a painting potentially worth millions - Roger sees the answer to all of his financial problems.<br /><br />But then things start to go wrong.  And then more wrong.  And then horribly, horribly wrong.<br /><br />(Note:  I'm trying to avoid any major spoilers, but there are a few potential ones in this paragraph.)<br />When Roger slips into Clas' apartment to get the Rubens, he makes a discovery that throws his entire world into disarray.  Which provokes him into a fit of pique and makes him sabotage Clas' chances for the Pathfinder CEO job.  Which somehow triggers something and the next thing he knows he's finding an apparently dead body in his car, and then he's running for his life, thinking Clas must've realized he'd stolen the Rubens... only to discover that Clas isn't after the Rubens at all.  And at every turn, people around him are either getting killed, or trying to kill him, or both.<br /><br />The performances are all top notch, from Aksel Hennie's outwardly super-confident but inwardly insecure Roger to Eivind Sander's clownishly crude Ove who obsesses over the Russian prostitute he spends all of his money on and who uses security cameras in his house to let his buddies at the security company watch some of the fun now and then.  Synnøve Macody Lund's Diana is layered, leaving the audience as well as Roger wondering what she knows and whose side she is truly on. Julie Ølgaard's Lotte turns on a dime, going from earthy erotic to neurotically needy to the completely unexpected as her character's role in the drama changes.  The standout performance though comes from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known to English-speaking audiences as the casually amoral and dangerous Jamie Lannister from the Game Of Thrones TV mini-series.  In Headhunters, Coster-Waldau's Clas is charming from the beginning, but even then you can sense that beneath that charm is something else, something calculating and, as events begin to unfold, tenacious, controlled and deadly.<br /><br />It's the cat-and-mouse game between Roger and Clas that really rivets you, heightened by Hennie's bringing out Roger's increasing fear, confusion and desperation while Coster-Waldau reveals the relentless dispassionate predator in Clas.  The tension just keeps getting racheted up higher and higher, with Clas resorting to more and more extreme measures to get Roger and Roger resorting to equally extreme measures to survive.  Tyldum does an excellent job with the pacing and with the twists and turns in the plot that keep you guessing as to what will happen next and how things will finally be resolved.  Stylistically, a lot of Headhunters reminded me of films by the Coen brothers where all of the details matter and how actions can have the most unintended consequences.  It also reminded me a lot of Hitchcock in the way that his protagonists often got swept up in events where they must struggle to find out what's going on even as they try to stay alive.<br /><br />My only real complaint about Headhunters is that I felt the ending wrapped things up just a little too neatly to be believable, and that the characters who survive at the end got off way, way too lightly.  One of the things I like about the Coen brothers' films is that no matter what the game is or how it ends, nobody gets to walk away with all of the chips.  Headhunters could have used a bit of that philosophy.  If I could've rated it four-and-a-half stars I would've, but the too-neat ending kept me from giving it the full five.<br /><br />But that aside, Headhunters is a really well-done thriller that keeps the tension and the stakes mounting higher and higher almost to the very end.  Highly recommended.iscover that Clas isn't after the Rubens at all.

B007TBCTRK|3.0|marc streitenfeld delivers in \\"prometheus\\" a reasonably good score straight out of the moody wing of the zimmer-gregson-williams school of film scoring embellished with some postmodern twists. in concept, the score is quite similar to something like HG-W's \\"smilla's sense of snow\\". this means -- a simple but okay theme, uncomplicated harmony, long, flowing and lean melodic lines whose spareness works well in evoking the vastness of space and barren landscapes on display. every now and then, the requisite chaotic passage erupts to support the monster action on-screen. electronics are very tastefully incorporated -- there are various rumbly noises and sound effects, but nothing sounds overtly synthesized or unnatural and the textures are interesting and unified. an unexpected bonus: quotes of goldsmith's marvelous original score, including the main theme and the conch effects. parts of the score, such as the track \\"hello mommy\\", also reflect the long shadow cast by elliot goldenthal's alien 3 score -- the distorted guitar, rattling percussion and brass fireworks are straight out of the goldenthal method. the score, overall, works extremely well for the film. as a piece of standalone music, it is less successful. when you strip away the effects and orchestration, the underpinnings of the score -- melody, harmony, and rhythm -- are just too simplistic to reward repeated listens. one can only imagine what an elliot goldenthal or howard shore might have done with such an opportunity. all that said -- far from a failure.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|My first introduction to Rush was in 1985 when I was 14. I was captivated by their early releases, but must say they have evolved unlike any band out there. They have not tried to do the same thing and expect the same. Instead they have stayed current while maintaining their unique sound and on top of that they are only three guys as old as my Dad, but as young as any twenty something wannabee rocker out there.<br /><br />This album is fantastic as I have had at least 5 full listens. Every time I am in awe of the grooves, the lyrics and especially the bass chops and Neil's power and finesse on the kit. Alex adds beefy hooks and layers texture to compliment the fullness of this trio.<br />Lyrically, I am still exploring this album and can't wait for the book that comes out in September.<br /><br />So, for 27 years they continue to prove to me that they are the kings of Prog rock, but really are they prog....no they are the might RUSH!<br /><br />Five stars hands down!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|One would think with the recent revival Rush have received in terms of popularity and mainstream acceptance that they would be content to rest on their laurels and tour off their greatest hits for the rest of their lives. One would be wrong. Over forty years into their storied career, the three men that define Rush - vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer/lyricist/philosopher Neil Peart - are still going strong, sounding every bit as focused and inspired as they did in their halcyon days.<br /><br />Rather than pay tribute to a bygone area, \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" Rush's 20th (!) studio album take the road less traveled and breaks new ground for the group. Reconvening with producer Nick Raskulinecz (who helmed 2007's \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" as well as other recent mid-career revivals from Alice in Chains and Deftones), the sound that defines Rush on the album is big and bold. There isn't a song here that doesn't hit hard. Whether it's through the use of a pulsing bassline courtesy of Lee (\\"Caravan\\"), a sweeping orchestral arrangement (\\"The Garden\\") or an all-out guitar solo from Lifeson (\\"Headlong Flight\\"), Rush do their best to create an album that is as dense and expansive as it is heavy. And heavy it is. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is perhaps the heaviest Rush album to date, which will slap a grin on the face of anyone who's ever been a fan of the band. Just as heavy as the music are the lyrical passages by Peart, which ooze of his signature existentialism and enlightenment. This combination makes \\"Clockwork Angels\\" an instant classic and one that will sound every bit as new and fresh to the average fan as it will sound like home.<br /><br />The fact that Rush are still going strong and still pushing themselves this late in the game is a testament to their character and their ever-growing reputation as being one of the best bands not only in Canada, but in the entire world. Like most of their career, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" transcends generations; it is every bit as appealing to the average Rush fan, whether they be 15 or 50. So whether in mp3 form, on compact disc or even vinyl, if you are reading this, you owe it to yourself to experience \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" If this effort is any indication, the band still has a bright and fruitful future ahead of them.as appealing to the average Rush fan, whether they be 15 or 50.

1936608898|5.0|People are bombarded every day with information and misinformation about health, and particularly about food.  My job, educating corporate groups on all aspects of health, allows me to see just how confused people are.  It doesn't sound hard - just eat real food.  But people don't know where to start, and are utterly confused by everything they hear.  They need a simple users guide... an owners manual to themselves, if you like.  This book is exactly that.  A book written by Dallas and Melissa Hartwig, but highly collaborative in the making and refining.  These guys do a superb job of teaching you how your body responds to food and just what it needs to return it to a baseline of optimal health.  When trying to convey complex physiological and biochemical functions in an easy to understand format, you often lose a degree of accuracy or fidelity to your message.  But the Hartwig's nail it.  You can read this book with ease, from cover to cover, gaining deep insight into the effect food has on your mood and health, and confident in the scientific accuracy of what you are reading.  If you really want to change your life, It Starts With Food.

B007N85ZXY|4.0|This album is for fans of Ragged Glory, Year of the Horse, Greendale, and Broken Arrow. It's raw and sloppy rock and roll at it's finest. The music is loose, cathartic and joyful. No complaints there. The song choices however are a little strange for me because they are simply too familiar. I've heard \\"Oh Suzannah,\\" \\"she'll be coming round the mountain....\\" and the rest so many times it's hard to listen with fresh ears. Maybe Neil is challenging his listeners to rethink these standards but it is a big challenge. The one star reviews here on amazon simply do not make sense since this is definitely the Neil Young rock sound. Crazy Horse has always been a vehicle for Neil to let loose and on this album he definitely does. Then again, great art should always evoke a strong response and with this album you will either love it or hate it but you won't forget it.

B000OVLBHG|3.0|Paul Verhoeven has a real cult following.  Most trashy directors do.  I mean, looking at his filmography, it's hard to find a `great' film in the bunch and yet many celebrated cinephiles count films like `Basic Instinct' and `Showgirls' as two of the best films ever made.  I'm assuming they follow this logic up with the whole `so bad it's good' argument, but honestly I can't rally behind this.<br /><br />Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen, `Starship Troopers' is easily the best.<br /><br />Having read Robert Heinlein's novel while still in school, I can say that Verhoeven's adaptation isn't especially faithful, but he does pull some of the more blatant themes and uses them to propel forward the action in a way that pulls your eyes into focus.  In like Verhoeven fashion, `Starship Troopers' is at many times exploitive and does seem to have an occupancy with flesh and sexuality, and the soap operatic relationship circles does have an eye-rolling effect on viewers who are looking for a more focused action epic, but `Starship Troopers' does get a lot of things right.  The action in particular is stunning.  This is a bloody bath of alien warfare, and those bug creatures are grandiose and grotesque and totally hit every mark, and the gore factor is a huge plus for a film of this nature.<br /><br />The `hidden agenda' here is a nice touch because it adds weight to some of the more ridiculous aspects of the film.  This is essentially a satire pointed at governmental control in the guise of a mindless sci-fi epic and it does manage to make that point rather effectively, but to use that as an excuse for some of the more glaring issues the film has (the acting, the clich&eacute;s, the wasted development) is kind of lazy.  There are many `smart' satires that straddle that fine line and actually balance out the exploitive with genuine wit, and `Starship Troopers' doesn't quite get that.<br /><br />It is a fun film, sure, but it is also an easy film to criticize because it seems to relish in its own inadequacies.elish in its own inadequacies.

B001CN2WXM|5.0|LOL, my Ammy buddy Beany is going to have a fit when he sees this, considering that I gave his beloved `The Black Dahlia' a one star rating (sore subject, I know), but I can't help but salivate all over this flawless piece of filmmaking (by god, 1997 was an amazing year for film).  Having read Ellroy's novel, I just love the attention to detail taken to truly flesh this story out, and incorporating aspects from other novels (namely The Big Nowhere and White Jazz) was an act of genius for it really helped helm the depth of the film from start to finish.<br /><br />`L.A. Confidential' is one of the finest modern noirs ever put to film, because it understands the importance of paying homage without carbon copying the style of the classic noir.  I've made this argument in my review of `The Black Dahlia', but it bears repeating.  The style of the 50's noir was so entrenched in the aura of the times that it became a natural and obvious `cool' that just permeated those films and made them so engrossing.  That style is not really present in modern films.  Acting and filmmaking has evolved to the point where trying to mirror that style can result in awkward storytelling.  Case in point, `The Black Dahlia', a film that is jilted from the start by poor construction and a dated approach to a genre that has been exemplified by risk taking directors who have tried to inject new life into the genre.<br /><br />Curtis Hanson nails that here.<br /><br />The strength of this film lies in the way the actors attach their respective roles.  In a film year that brought us great ensembles in films like `Boogie Nights', `The Full Monty' and `The Ice Storm', `L.A. Confidential' towers above them all.  From Kevin Spacey's slickly layered corrupt cop to James Cromwell's stern command of his character's inhibitions to Russell Crowe's commanding portrayal of Buddy White and all his violent aggression, this cast is flawless.  It still bugs me that Kim Basinger was the ONLY actor to receive an Academy Award nomination (and I strongly feel that her win was a `win for the whole cast' in the eyes of voters), for she was very good yet pales in comparison to her male co-stars.<br /><br />The production design, the sharp edits, the beautifully layered script and Hanson's marvelous attention to detail help propel this to the top of the heap as one of the finest films to come out; possibly ever.  It is certainly the best film noir to grace the big screen since the days of Bogart and it rivals most of those in sheer audacity and ambitiousness.<br /><br />The classic `good cop/bad cop' story has never been fleshed out this deeply.ademy Award nomination (and I strongly feel that her win was a `win for the whole cast' in the eyes of voters), for she was very good yet pales in comparison to her male co-stars.<br /><br />The production design, the sharp edits, the beautifully layered script and Hanson's marvelous attention to detail help propel this to the top of the heap as one of the finest films to come out; possibly ever.

Yes, I understand that sounds odd (that my best friend was eighteen) but I've always been like that so it does make sense in my world.  Anyways, I absolutely loved this movie then, and maybe it's nostalgia but I still love it.  I've had a recent disagreement with an Ammy friend when I made the statement that this was one of the best sci-fi flicks of the 90's, but I still stand by this statement.  It knows exactly what it is and it stays very true to itself.  This isn't trying to be extra smart.  This isn't an `E.T.' or a `Blade Runner'.  This is an action centered sci-fi comedy and as such, it is a total blast.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have great chemistry, and the action scenes are tremendous.  The CGI works wonderfully, the makeup win at the Oscars was totally deserved, and who doesn't just love that theme song!  Yes, this is cheesy at times, but it isn't trying to be anything other than what it is and it embraces the cheese factor by balancing it out with genuine wit and charm.  I love it when Will Smith embraces his obvious niche, and this is it.<br /><br />`Men in Black' is just a lot of fun.  Sadly, the sequel was a disaster of epic proportions, and I'm scared to see the third one.
B0086700CM|5.0|ok so addictive found myself playing this in ssr got yelled at by a teacher. but it was totally worth it!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This movie was as entertaining as other Tom Cruse projects. I enjoyed it even if it seems predictable; but isn't that what we sometimes want?
B007I2BZIE|1.0|Look, I just can't get past the production values of this release. It is un-listenable if you're going to go the duration. This Nick guy is NOT the producer for Rush. Not sure what he was thinking, but you gotta think the three band members must have heard this jumbled mess, and agreed to release it. Vapor Trails was bad, but their last effort seemed to be on the right track. Now we're right back in the hole. So no, I'm not going to give it another 6 spins at an hour plus a pop, don't have time to waste, and I just couldn't take it. I don't know if Terry Brown was a genius, but if he was, there must have been alot of then running around in the mid-seventies. The concepts of dynamics, space, tone, clarity; all forgotten or dismissed. There are some well produced records out there, mostly in the jazz world, so I think we still have the technology to do it. Too bad. And without more listens I won't be able to get USED to Geddy's terrible vocals (range-bound with no melody), and scattered and unfocused songs. BTW, I am a big fan going back to 1974, and this does not knock them off their pedestal. They did great things, but all things must and do pass...
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game will keep you entertained for a long while. Many levels, neat graphics and soundtrack. Worth every penny. I hope they make another one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app! Great for balancing your checkbook or just about any calculation you need. You can see the last number you put in so you don't lose your place.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I'm not sure if I'm listening to the same thing as all of the raving fans of this album are. At first, I had to check my iPod to make sure I hadn't selected the wrong recording because this is just as disappointing as previous releases.<br /><br />Let me state for the record that I am a die-hard Rush fan as well as a musician. Rush was an inspiration when I started playing. Unfortunately this album is yet another in a string of disappointments for me as a fan and as a musician.<br /><br />Now let me review. Let's just first all agree, Peart's lyrics are absurd. They've always been absurd. Who cares? Did any of us really start listening to Rush because of the lyrics?<br /><br />The songs, in terms of musical composition, are dull, monotonous, mostly in a minor tonality and all of very similar tempo. Even after several listenings, there isn't a single thing that sticks in my head. That's not a good sign.<br /><br />Peart's drumming has gone from finesse and amazing creativity to the kind of ham-handed pounding that people usually associate with my limited drumming skills. Unfortunately that has been the case for some time now. Lee's singing is as dull and monotonous as the compositions. Lifeson gets a little more spotlight on this one, but there's really nothing special about what he's doing. Maybe the production is a little better here but that's as far as I'll go.<br /><br />I hate to compare the recent work of a band that's been around for a long time to the work from earlier in their career, especially when the early work was so spectacular. Everybody needs to move forward. But perhaps it's time the guys look back and evaluate what made some of their earlier work so good (not popular, but good) - it was different, groundbreaking, and the playing gave you \\"Holy cow he did what?\\" moments. When you heard Rush playing, even without Lee's singing, you knew it was Rush. Today, it's Lee's singing that's the only thing identifying the band. Take his vocals out and the band could be any one of the forgettable bands that are out there these days.<br /><br />Yes, my expectations are high, so maybe I'm just bitter. I keep waiting for a new Rush album that gets played a few times, grabs me, and becomes the only thing I listen to for months. It hasn't happened in a long time, and it certainly didn't happen with Clockwork Angels.
B000000OTY|5.0|If I had to choose between the dvd/blu-ray or cd version of this concert, yet a difficult decision, would have to go with the cd.  The quality is great on it and of course loaded with masterpieces of Peter Gabriel's.  I never get tired of listening to it nor will I ever.  By far one of the greatest live music cd's I have ever heard.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|The Alchemyst is a good, quick, bedtime read. The characters have ties to history and Michael Scott has a way with bringing these historical figures voice and life. The story is fast-paced and engaging, a good read for preteens and adults alike.
B0035J6TA8|3.0|This is a different type of album for Peter Gabriel but was nice to see him try something a little different in recording other people's music since outside of a few songs has wrote all his own music to date I believe.  If you are new to his music or looking for a universal cd then I don't think this is the place to start but if you are a dedicated fan then be sure to consider it for your collection.

B003ICWTTM|5.0|I'm a long-time Springsteen fan (since 1975), and the set list on this includes most of my favorite E Street songs.  This was an impulse purchase for me, as a consolation (as I was unable to secure tickets for any decent seats anyway--stinking StubHub scalpers!) when they played on their current tour.<br />My family and I watched it after work/school over the course of a couple of nights, and even those who aren't as fervent Springsteen fans as I am, and had never seen him in concert before, commented on what incredible energy he has and what an amazing performer he is. The blu-ray edition is spectacular.<br />I have to admit, I cried when the Big Man appears.  RIP Clarence.<br />I would highly recommend this to any Bruce Springsteen fan!
B005LAIGWS|1.0|If you liked the original \\"Ghost Rider,\\" you'll be sorely disappointed with this sequel. The story line is silly and the movie is a punctuated -- all too often --- with sophomoric cinematic techniques and effects. Save your money and pass on this disaster.

B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I didn't even bother finishing this book and I'm mad at myself that I wasted $12.99 on it.  It started out with a lot of detail about her mother dying of cancer, which is upsetting.  Then, to help herself get over the sadness of the death of her mom, she cheats on her husband several times and becomes pretty seriously involved with a man who introduces her to heroin.  All the time this is going on she talks about what a great man her husband is and how much they love each other.  I didn't understand this at all. She even legally changed her last name to \\"Strayed\\" after her divorce, because she strayed - like she's proud of it. Finally she gets started on the hike and I thought I'd finally start liking the book.  Right off the bat she talks about going to the bathroom in using such a weird term for it that I can't get it out of my head unfortunately. Then, when I came on here to read some of the reviews to see if anyone else thinks like I do and saw that there is the killing of a horse in the book, I just gave up.  All along she talks about how she and her husband got matching horse tattoos to remember their marriage by.  I wondered why a horse and now I know that I don't want to know.<br /><br />The parts about the hike I did read were good, but I just kept waiting for something to gross me out or make me sad and then decided it wasn't worth it.  I really should have known this book would be kind of dark when I saw that Oprah chose it for her new book club.  I always found her choices to be upsetting and nothing has changed there.  I bought the Oprah version and she underlines several passages and then comments on them.<br /><br />I see that many people do like this book, so it could just be me, but if you are a little sensitive to disturbing images like I am, you may want to skip this book.

B005H9B44A|2.0|I love Thor, it's great fun.... However, resist the temptation for instant gratification and don't purchase the Instant Video Option. The sound quality is horrible. The music and the effects totally drown out the dialog. It's really apparent at the beginning with Odin's narration. Just wait a couple of days for the DVD to arrive. You'll be glad that you did.
1594744769|3.0|After a couple of chapters into this book, I was like WOW !!!  Couldn't put it down, the story drew me in and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  The beginning of the story was creepy and mysterious, just up my alley - I was hungry for more, so I kept reading late into the night.  What seemed like an awesome tale ended up turning bizarre.  At that point, I was so far into the book that I couldn't put it down, I needed to find out how the story wrapped up and so I continued reading.  I enjoyed the author's writing style and it might have been the only thing that kept me from setting this book aside without finishing it.

1932735410|5.0|I had about 4 years of PM experience. I had the right number of pre-exam PMP course credits. I read the reviews in 2011 and selected Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep Book. I followed the study instructions in the book (which include following along in the PMBOK Guide). I studied hard for about 2.5 months in evenings and on weekends. I passed the PMP Exam on my first try. I believe that I owe not only passing the exam to Rita's book, but I also credit reading this book with giving me a truer understanding of the words in the PMBOK Guide and of PMP in general. Caveat: The book came out in July 2011 but the exam changed (supposedly dramatically) at the end of August 2011; I would like know how well the 7th edition covers the new exam (and if it does, how did they get the inside scoop before the exam came out).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I won't be saying much because the 1800 other reviewers who gave this one star have already pretty much said it all: this book is awful. The classy cover art appears to be the only reason this isn't sitting with the rest of the Harlequin romances--it's so painfully dull. All the cliches are here: the innocent virgin, the controlling/irresistible man, female orgasms that happen as often as blinking, etc etc. SO LAME.<br /><br />The only thing I have to add is the actual definition of SUBCONSCIOUS: a part of the mind/action/behavior of which one is NOT AWARE. Just sayin.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|More keyboard oriented and trippier than the Black Crowes. Mellower than New Earth Mud.  Excellent flowing record.  This is something that bears up to repeated listens.  My only (minor) gripe is in the production, which is, I think, a little muddy, especially compared to Chris' Black Crowes work.  All in all one of the better records so far this year.  Chris can sing the proverbial phone book and it would be great. I look forward to seeing them soon.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I first downloaded this app on my blackberry, and I have read about 15-20 books from it. It's great, most people take their phone everywhere with them, so if you have a couple of minutes of down time at the doctors office, or waiting for your car to be serviced, this is an awesome app to have. I just downloaded it on my 7\\" tablet, and it's even better than before, now with the larger screen size, it's no different than reading a paperback novel that you would buy in the stores now-a-days. You can get quite a few books from the Kindle Book store for the same price as 1 book retail in the stores. They have tons of free books, and alot more pretty cheap.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just got this app for the second time. First time on my Blackberry Torch, this time on my 7\\" Android 4.0 tablet. It's a great app on both devices. Now I can carry this to church on sundays, and have no issues finding where the pastor is preaching from quickly and easily. I know it's not the same experience as with a written bible, but it's pretty close. I can still highlight, and take notes, but now I can also adjust font sizes for easier reading, post favorite scriptures to facebook, or just send them in a text message, or email, and it's alot lighter than a bible of similar size. Plus, this app had daily reading/devotional plans, and it keeps track of where you left off if you got interrupted, or had to quit reading for a minute. I recommend this app to anyone looking for a nice bible you can take with you absolutely everywhere on your phone, or tablet device.

I can't imagine anyone else liking it.<br /><br />It was one of the most boring of all Grisham books, and that is saying something. Not much really happened in this book. And there is something disturbing about a 13-year-old who gives out legal advice (\\"yes, your parents should go file bankrupcy. Good luck!\\"), and seems to have no life behind wanting to be a judge.<br /><br />I downloaded all of the \\"Boone\\" books because I thought they would be some light, simple reading.

B000G6O2TS|5.0|The Schleich line of mounted knights on horseback is superior to anything else out there,  as are  all of their figurines.  They also make  excellent  dinosaurs, farm animals, cowboys,  dragons  and<br />other figures.  Their line of horses are also outstanding.  I have been buying the mounted knights for about the last ten years.  At first I purchased them for my own children,  and now I give them as<br />gifts to all my nephews, who love them and mount them on shelves in their rooms.  I have also purchased a complete set for myself.  They come packaged in a beautiful display box.  I hesitate to even<br />call these \\"toys\\".  Excellent way to get kids away from the TV and video games.  Just wish these were around when I was a child. Well, I still am a child, according to my wife.  The  Amazon prices are<br />great .  Also there is another maker of similar figures out there called PAPO.  Here's a heads-up.  On some toy store web sites the PAPO line of knights is posted with the  SCHLEICH line.  I have<br />bought some PAPO products in the past.  They are not bad for younger children to play with, but in no way are they the quality of the Schleich line.

B0075CRED2|4.0|When it has came down to George Michael, he musically has been one of the most distinctive singer/songwriters whom not only made great songs from the 80's to today, but has had some of the most brilliant covers of all time from acts like Stevie Wonder, Elton John and many others. Back in the 80's, he had massive success with Wham! and his solo work with Faith. But with all of that, he still wanted to mature and spring ahead into a different light. He did that in his music as well, by stripping himself from his image, but also the sex symbol image that people have loved from his Faith days. In that, he made a mature distinctive style in his voice, but was heavily overshadowed in his strength.<br /><br />George Michael's 1990 album Listen Without Prejudice Volume 1 which has been re-issued in the United Kingdom sounds well, and remains as bold and classic today, as it did when it came out over twenty years ago. The songs show a style in the voice that stands well, and every song from his the acoustic guitars on Something To Save, to the somber Mother's Pride from the voice and the piano alone, all the way to the driven Freedom '90!. While George wasn't in appearance in his videos anymore like he showed, he wasn't even on the album cover either. George had wanted to show that the songs could speak for itself, and he could blossom as a person. He did, but his label didn't like it, with the lackluster attention of the album. Still, George made a good attempt in his voice and style, in each note and soul. As a result, George left the label after a lawsuit interfered with George, and he was forced to pay Sony nearly $10 million dollars, yet he did walk away to record again. Still, there is so much George had to say in his voice that still stands shoulders here, better on this album than most other artists today in their records.<br /><br />While George Michael did record a sequel to Listen Without Prejudice Volume 1, it never was actually released and instead it would be his 1996 album Older that would continue to shows George Michael's soulful style. Still, if you are a die hard George Michael fan, than this would be a great buy for your music library. It is definitely a great buy, and the songs are definitely still worth their money today. It is definitely a good buy, considering that there are a lot of poor records and artists that have came out with music today. George made you want to listen without prejudice and it still stands high.<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Album Cover: B-<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+is 1996 album Older that would continue to shows George Michael's soulful style.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|Perhaps it was because the book is as exciting as an Associated Press report. Many of the characters are boring, it's ridden with clichés, there's little that stitches the story together, the political mumbo-jumbo and jargon plagues the writing as a pack of ravenous zombies. The book as a whole is a collection of vignettes covering a genre that has been beyond overdone. Do yourselves a favor and skip this, find The Walking Dead graphic novels (not the mediocre TV adaptation) and give it a try.

B007Y30OQ6|4.0|<raynor08@gmail.com> wrote: For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \\"fanboy\\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.<br /><br />Physical Characteristics The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.<br /><br />New and \\"Improved\\" Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.<br /><br />The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \\"new\\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.<br /><br />The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however)so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Smart Covers aren't really \\"smart\\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.<br /><br />Multitasking Support One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-ta
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book exceeded my expectations with the interesting stories that it contained to support the data that exists around habits.  It was very interesting to hear how people with certain brain damage could still perform certain tasks through the powers of habits.  There was a great story on Rosa Parks in the section on the habits of societies.  It contained information that I was unaware of that was quite interesting.  Also, there is a story on addicted gamblers and related studies.  Another on sleep terrors and a case of man who killed his wife in his sleep.  Lots of good stories on the habits of some large corporations, as well.<br /><br />There is really just some fascinating stuff in this book on the brain and the information we are learning about it.  It was a fairly quick read.  There are tons of references in the book for those who wish to do some fact checking.  The epilogue of the book is where the author provides some guidance on how to recognize and change habits of your own, if you wish.  I expected more of this in the book, but was not disappointed by the direction the author took.
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood has been a mainstay on the country and pop music charts since her rise to fame as quite possibly the most successful winner of American Idol to date.<br /><br />Her newest release \\"Blown Away\\" does feature some classic Carrie elements but also seems to venture into new territory with mixed results. Several songs include some surprisingly electronic beats and some have lyrics of a deeper, darker nature than anything else we've seen from Underwood in the past.<br /><br />The most notable tracks on the album include \\"See You Again,\\" \\"One Way Ticket,\\" \\"Do You Think About Me,\\" Nobody Ever Told You\\" and \\"Who Are You.\\" Between these songs Underwood delivers a little bit of traditional country but mostly a mix of fun and uplifting music and lyrics with a lot of pop.<br /><br />The lesser quality tracks would have to include \\"Two Black Cadillacs,\\" \\"Thank God For Hometowns\\" and \\"Cupid's Got A Shotgun.\\" The first has a fairly traditional country vibe but is extremely dark. The other two go the extreme country route as well with the first being too basic and the second coming across a bit cheesey.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are pretty decent but nothing outstanding.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Blown Away\\" is probably not one of Underwood's best efforts but it is still far better than most of the music out there. I would give it a grade of a B-.
B0086700CM|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!  I love this game its the best. awesome people who created this game. I have no other words than AWESOME and BEST GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

030758836X|3.0|In the beginning, it was boring.  Couldn't understand where the great reviews were coming from.  I rarely finish a book that doesn't grab me instantly.  But I decided given those reviews, to stick it out.  Midway, I was hooked.  Very intense, complex, and very, very good.  Only to have it completely and totally fizzle out in the end.  I was left with an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. I had planned on reading her other books, but now I am not sure I want to bother.<br /><br />This book is like a race car.  Started up slowly, built up steam to an incredible level and blew up before it got to the finish line.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I wanted to see this when it came out but did not have time to get to the theater.  forgot about it then saw the avengers, and have seen all the Iron man movies, so had to rent this, helped to fill in the gaps.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say?  Not great literature, but a great, easy read!  Fun book...don't think I need to say more.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I was kind of surprised I liked this book so much.  I thought at first that the alternating chapters between characters and time lines would be confusing, but I actually really liking it.  I enjoyed the perspective on the Holocaust spurring from an event that I really knew nothing about.  I had a little trouble keeping up with some of the characters and remembering who was who besides the main few characters.  I thought I was about to be disappointed in the end, but I ended up enjoying it to the last page.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good game to play in your free time. recommend it to you and your children!<br />thanks to nordcurrent for a such game
B0031RS2I6|5.0|Wel yes, at least to me, this is the funniest novel I've ever read. The passage between Bertie Wooster, the amiable but accident prone hero, and the incomparable Jeeves, following the famous Market Snodsbury Grammar School speech, is a priceless gem. I won't reveal it here for fear of spoiling it for the unfamiliar reader. But when you do read it make sure you're not on a train, bus or a public space, and above all, if you're 'reading' it as an audiobook, pull over to the side of the road. 'I very much fear,' as Jeeves might have put it, 'that an accident will result otherwise.'
B003O86FMW|5.0|did you ever think that there could be as good of a book as this?AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am 14 years old and I thought that this was the best book ever.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I'm trying...really I am. But coming from a lifelong fan...first of 39 shows of theirs for me was '78 Hemispheres...Clockwork Angels is quite the disappointment.<br /><br />First and foremost they need to dump Nick R. Sonically this thing is a muddy train wreck of a mix. I downloaded the 96hz/24bit flac version from HD Tracks cause I wanted to have the best possible sonic track available. Geez I was hoping for more improvement over the 3 mp3 releases. There is definitely improvement but the mix is such a cluster in the first place it's hard to do anything with it other than add more muddy dynamic range. On a very good system too.<br /><br />There are some highlights. Musically they are still playing fantastically. Especially when you consider their age. But for the most part it's a gigantic wall of distorted sound. Peart's drums are quite often lost in all the noise. Alex's guitar has opportunity to shine but too often it's just distorted and over amped without definition. Geddy's voice is all over the place. As is the structure of the songs. Like they had a million ideas and wanted to get them all in at once. Just doesn't work. There's enough low end mud and thump to be very annoying. Seems they must be trying to attain the 90's Seattle grunge feel. It just doesn't work. They are better than this.<br /><br />Wasn't the Vapor Trails fiasco enough to teach them? Apparently not. As some one else said....Terry Brown we miss you!<br /><br />3 Stars ONLY cause it's Rush and at least they're still around and touring.
B0086700CM|5.0|LOVE IT SOOOOOO MUCH!!  IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER!! EVERYONE SHOULD GET IT ON THEIR iPad, Kindle Fire, Nook, etc. BEST game ever invented along with zoo story 2 and monster park and aqua pets.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't read a book in years. This book I read in 48 hours!  Now I have everyone at work ready it too. Extremely addictive.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|... but hardly in a league with Payne's previous three films -- Election, About Schmidt and Sideways -- and I have to wonder whether the seven-year layoff threw the director off his stride. While The Descendants features a reliable performance by Clooney (albeit what has become a fairly standard Clooney performance), a creeping stiffness occasionally overtakes the script and the characters seem a bit cliched (i.e. precocious younger and angry older daughter, idiot boyfriend, grumpy father-in-law). In the past, Payne so worked over his cliches that they were no longer cliches; he mined their essential reality and revealed them to us in ways that seemed new. This time, working with two new writing partners, he doesn't and his movie seems facile (notably the coincidence at its heart), scenic and mainstream rather than personal.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so fun you can play so many different games and earn coins easely but the gunnery game is lights out
B007I2BZIE|3.0|It's like your big brother has this album playing in his room and you are forced to listen through the closed door. Why can no-one since Terry Brown capture the awesome sound of RUSH? Where are the dynamics? Listen to By-Tor and the Snow Dog. That song has it all and the drums sound like thunder. OK, so the mix is bad. Red Barchetta tells a far more exciting story in one damn song. OK, so the story is so-so, maybe the book will help. I love a balls to the wall jam like on Freewill, where it fits in with the theme of the song. Clockwork Angels is just jam, but very little peanut butter (melody). In my house we call that a girl sandwich,(ironic, but so what...)Lastly, the Garden was set up to give Alex the stage for his most awe-inspiring solo ever to end the song, but they cut it short and keep singing and pounding away. What a shame. We miss you Terry Brown.
B000002TYX|3.0|When this first volume of Beatles Anthology came out in 1995, there was great anticipation of many unreleased studio recordings being released from their many productive sessions at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, along with demo recordings, as well as the new material that was recorded by the three surviving members. Some of the material, such as the songs from the Decca Records test session, have been available in the grey market for years. The biggest disappointment with Volume 1 is the stunning lack of alternative studio recordings for the \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With The Beatles\\" albums. Even though the tapes for the 11 song, 12 hour, \\"Please Please Me\\" marathon, album sessions no longer exist, some copied session tapes exist from John Lennon's tape archive and, undoubtedly, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr probably have some interesting things in their personal archives that they could have contributed from this session as well, but chose not to. These personal Lennon archive tapes have been the source of numerous bootlegs that vary widely in quality, since the late Eighties. Most of the session tapes for \\"With The Beatles\\" DO exist but, strangely, these tracks were left off too. In their places, in both cases, are recordings of performances from radio and television, and other live recordings all of which range from poor to just average in performance and/or sound quality. John Lennon said, in later interviews, that the Beatles had lost it as a live band by the time they got their first big taste of fame. Some of these recordings prove this to be somewhat true. The alternate studio tracks that are present and the new track, \\"Free As A Bird\\", make this package worth buying. Fortunately, Volumes 2 and 3 would feature far more alternate and unreleased studio tracks that would more successfully satisfy the appetites of hungry Beatles fans craving anything new.
B007KAJG3K|1.0|The movie was great, but as a product, it's very hard for me to give any package that *only* contains an Ultraviolet a good score. If it had UV and Digital Copy, that would be fine. What burns the most, is that Digital Copy was great. Everyone was happy. Ultraviolet is a severe downgrade. Consumers do NOT like buying downgraded products. If we started with UV, we probably wouldn't notice. But going from Digital Copy to UV is an obvious downgrade. Flixter has horrible service. Having to download the app to your PC is horrible.<br /><br />Not being able to view on your portable device without Wi-Fi or 3G/4G/LTE, is horrible. (Digital Copies are supposed to be PORTABLE, I can't view UV on an airplane, or during a card ride. Great, I can view it at home where I have Wi-Fi, but then I could just pop in the Blu-Ray, couldn't I?<br /><br />Ultraviolet is such a poor idea, and terribly implemented. I really hope it fails, because it's bad for consumers. Quite simply, UV is *NOT* portable, it's limited.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I am from a military family and I love this movie. I love the fact that Real Navy Seals were in this movie and showed this country how great our Armed Forces are.  I was moved to tears. Great action! A different movie,  Not the B.S. that is  in Hollywood now about zombies and vampires. This is what our trained soldiers really do for our country. God bless them!

0894803123|5.0|I bought the Cuisinart 2 quart Pure Indulgence ice cream maker. I have made vanilla, eggnog, coffee, oreo, chocolate chip & chocolate ice cream. Absolutely Fab. My only suggestion is buying the pasteurized liquid eggs. I make ice cream every week & my family loves all the recipes.<br /><br />Pasteurized liquid eggs is the easiest way to go. They now come in 3 packs (1 pack = 2 eggs). This saves you a lot of time so you do not have to cook & temper your eggs. The strawberry ice cream is to die for, it is my family's new favorite.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|With stunning visuals with a flawless script and cast \\"Prometheus\\" clearly shines as the star sci-fi film of the new decade. The epic masterpiece of veteran director, Ridley Scott, tells of a group of scientist searching the the ultimate question, \\"Where do we come from?\\" and finding the horror of the truth. Perfectly paced, and a beautiful cast lead by the superb Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), with nods to its father masterpiece and a clear ending which perfectly sets up the beginning of  \\"Alien\\", and the hopeful possibility of the continuation of Elizabeth Shaw's adventures, it could possibly be the best movie of the year.

0385534639|5.0|The Wunschtraum clock was by far the coolest thing in the circus in my opinion, although I had to re read that chapter about 4 times before I was able to understand what exactly the clock looked like, I also had to buy this book in my native language spanish and re read the same chapter for I was scared I was missing some details.<br />The second coolest thing was the labyrinth Marco and Celia created.<br />This magical, deliciously written book is about two selfish magicians who decide to play a game. They each choose a player and a venue is set up for the game. The venue happens to be the circus.<br />The players fall in love with each other and they gradually find happiness.<br />I think it's safe to say that this book could have been a lot easier to read if the writer didn't mix past, and future, the change in dates confused me terribly.<br />By page 35 I had already read the phrase \\"a great deal\\" too many times. By the end of the book the phrase was branded in my brain.<br />Widget and Poppet were super cute.<br />I have a few things I wish I could ask the characters because I feel like the book went on and on with meticulous details about what the circus looked like but left out details about the characters.<br />Any way, I loved this book. Very original story.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|What made \\"Alien\\" such a great movie was not only a believable and terrifying monster, but great characters and brilliant writing. The Nostramo was an entirely believable ship and the actors fit seamlessly into this universe so much so that when the creature began taking them out, you felt empathy for them and fear on their behalf.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ridley Scott falls prey to the new bells and whistles available to him with the new technology that litters this film. Between the blue screen landscapes and interiors and the overlaid holographic computer screens, the characters and story play third fiddle while Prometheus burns a cold, sterile flame. To be fair to Scott, he is not the only filmmaker who allows his work to be leadened by such technology, but one would have hoped that a filmmaker of his stature and reputation would have dialed down the periphery details and focused on the elements of story and character that could have elevated this to a great science fiction film. Instead, it dies within the first ten minutes. A truly great disappointment and unfitting prequel to one of the best films of its generation.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I thought it was great,  until  i tryed to buy colors. i saved my coins to buy a color pack and it just took my coins and didn't give me my colors

0547569653|3.0|I read this book because Jurek was featured in Christopher McDougall's [[ASIN:0307279189 Born to Run]], which I loved. I also enjoy running books more generally, so I figured I'd give this one a try, even though I knew going in that there was another major aspect that I was less interested in: in addition to running, Jurek is also very focused on diet, and achieved his major ultramarathon victories while being a committed vegan. So, as is obvious from the title, this memoir focuses both on running and on food.<br /><br />The first thing to emphasize is that it is a memoir, more than a book focused on a specific running event. Jurek tells us a lot about how his difficult childhood gave him the determination needed to succeed as an ultrarunner. We also read about the death of his mother, his messy divorce, and his attempts to find peace and transcendence through running. I came away with the impression that Jurek is a really good guy, committed to his beliefs but not the sort to force those beliefs on others.<br /><br />Still, the fact remains that memoirs just aren't my favourite type of reading. Thinking back on the running books that I've enjoyed, I think I prefer the ones that focus on a particular race and provide people's backstories as part of the lead-up to the main event: books like Born to Run, or [[ASIN:0061373141 A Race Like No Other]], or [[ASIN:014312207X You Are an Ironman]]. Or, in the case of books focused on an individual, there's something else about their particular story that grips me: I was interested in [[ASIN:0618919104 Triumph]] because of the political issues surrounding the Berlin Olympics in 1936, and I was interested in [[ASIN:1934030732 An Accidental Athlete]] because I can relate to the feelings of a non-athlete taking up running. The story of someone who's just always been a good runner, though, seems not to hold a lot of interest for me unless there's something more as well.<br /><br />And of course, there is something more here: the focus on veganism. For people who are already vegans themselves, or who are even remotely considering it, I can imagine that this book would make for a compelling read. I did appreciate Jurek's point that he felt much better and became a better runner after he switched to a vegan diet. I just can't imagine doing it myself, though; the amount of extra effort involved is just too much for me.<br /><br />Since I do generally want to eat more healthily, though, I had thought going in that I might still be interested in some of the included recipes. There's one at the end of every chapter, or 22 in all. In reality, though, I found that the recipes just slowed down the book; whenever I got into the flow of it, that flow was soon interrupted. I don't know that I'll actually try out any of the recipes, either. The ones that I'm more likely to make--basic mainstream Mexican-type things like guacamole, salsa, or refried beans--are things that I don't really need this book for. On the other hand, I'm not really interested in some of the more extreme vegan recipes like pizza bread with tofu \\"cheese\\". Maybe most importantly, though, the fact that the recipes are mixed in with the main text of the book, and not listed in the index as far as I can see, means that I'm just unlikely to look at these recipes now that I'm done reading. The only way to get at them is to flip through the book and consider each one individually, which is pretty inefficient. I think it might have been better both for the flow of the text and for future reference if the recipes had all been gathered together at the end.<br /><br />So, all that is to explain why I seem to be one of the only people who didn't love this book. I don't think it's a bad book at all; I probably just wasn't the ideal reader. If you're interested in general memoirs or veganism as well as running, then you may want to give this book a try. But if you're just looking for something else like Born to Run, then this may not be quite whatyou want.you want.

0316023744|4.0|Thanks to recent good World War Two books (such as the masterpiece \\"Inferno\\" by Max Hastings) and enduring WWII classics, readers have a wealth of great WWII history books to choose from. The world tore itself apart in flames of war sweeping across planet Earth. 70 million people horrifically died. Beevor's WWII overview of WWII is especially good at filling in important details.<br /><br />See WWII book list below.<br /><br />Now Antony Beevor, an accomplished British historian of the Second World War (including \\"Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege\\"), has produced a comprehensive narrative of World War II that is one of the best. So much information is packed in each concise paragraph. Some of the stories are astonishing: Unprecedented combat violence across the globe. Cold exterminations. Textbook military tactics and misguided blunders. Rapes. Critical strategic interpretations are sometimes amiss or missing, unfortunately in this book, including the aims of Nazi ideology and USA's emerging influence for a new post-war world of free determination and free trade, as compared to the world before WWII with colonialism and the Versailles Treaty.<br /><br />Contrasting Beevor's \\"Second World War\\" against other great and recent WWII overview books, this book has fewer gaps in details, without the book seeming scattered. For example, \\"Storm of War\\" by British historian Andrew Roberts focuses on Hitler and has \\"must read\\" interpretations, but the coverage of the Pacific is light. In contrast, Beevor's book has great coverage of Japan's overlooked war in China that killed millions and details other important areas. The bloodbath Eastern Front is covered well in both books. \\"Inferno\\" by Max Hastings, also British, tells the overall story of the war brilliantly and adds the individual's experience but omits essential strategic issues, such as the Atlantic Charter. Beevor, in contrast, is more comprehensive. Gerhard Weinberg (A World at Arms) brilliantly covers strategic dimensions, including Hitler and USA, while Beevor's book has better battle coverage but it misses the Nazi story and USA's strategic role, and Beevor's bibliography (at his website) does not include the best books on the strategic dynamics of USA. John Keegan (Second World War) sticks to the major military battles. Martin Gilbert (Second World War) abruptly begins with the invasion of Poland and hardly covers the Pacific.<br /><br />See book list below. You will want to supplement Beevor's detailed book with other WWII books because some interpretations are debatable or missing. As an example, hundreds of thousands of French civilians packed-up and fled to the southwest away from the coming Germans, jamming the roads, and Beevor declares, \\"Once again it was the women who bore the brunt of the disaster and who rose to the occasion with self-sacrifice and calm. The men were the ones in tears of despair.\\" Wow, that's a broad statement about a lot of people. As another example, Storm of War details how Hitler made a critical blunder in ordering the German tanks to stop from advancing into Dunkirk because of perceived soft ground and ideological neutrality with Britain, while Beevor just says Hitler stopped because his advancing forces were thin. Read other books (see list below), including books articulating Franklin Roosevelt's post-war influence for collective security to prevent world war 3, USA transitioning from isolationism to superpower, the Atlantic Charter based on FDR's freedom ideals and decline of colonialism, pivoting from Churchill's pecking at the Europe underbelly to the invasion of D-Day urged by US generals, the destruction of the Nazi Third Reich, the establishment of economically strong democracies in Germany and Japan, and post-war economic stability to prevent another Great Depression. (Weinberg: A WORLD AT ARMS; Black: FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT CHAMPION OF FREEDOM; Borgwart: A NEW DEAL FOR THE WORLD; Louis: IMPERIALISM AT BAY; Fenby: ALLIANCE THE INSIDE STORY OF HOW ROOSEVELT, STALIN AND CHURCHILL WON ONE WAR AND BEGAN ANOTHER; O'Connor: DIPLOMACY FOR VICTORY). That was a sharp contrast to the Versailles Treaty and world of colonialism before WWII.<br /><br />Churchill was furious about the Atlantic Charter because he wanted colonialism but needed U.S. help. Later in 1944, Churchill and Stalin made a secret deal in Moscow called the \\"Percentages Agreement\\" or \\"Naughty Deal\\" to give USSR primary control of Eastern Europe countries, a sell-out of those countries, and Britain influence in Greece (and not self determination). Churchill told Stalin, \\"Might it not be thought rather cynical if it seemed we had disposed of these issues so fateful to millions of people, in such an offhand manner? Let us burn the paper.\\" Stalin replied, \\"No, you keep it.\\" Beevor discloses that but says nothing about FDR's post-war vision from the start, instead making him look naive at Yalta. Actually, the Yalta agreement called for free elections and proclaimed the freedom of self-determination, using Atlantic Charter language. President Ronald Reagan later said, \\"We reject any interpretation of the Yalta agreement that suggests American consent for the division of Europe into spheres of influence.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I disliked this book so much, I don't even know where to begin. The main character was boring, annoying and poorly developed. Is she innocent and naive or clever and witty? The same phrases are used over and over (her breath hitched, he gasped, she looked for a hair tie, he has gray eyes...). The sex was mostly boring and just happened too much, making the reading tedious.  And why was he always saying things like \\"I'm going to take you now, Anastasia \\". It read like he was explaning a dental procedure to her. I could go on but I don't want to waste any more time on this book. If this review keeps just one person from reading this crap, I'll be happy.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I would call myself a non-fiction type of guy.  In fact, outside of school, I've probably only finished a handful of novels.  I do however have a passion for excellent writing and for North Korea.  This book definitely fits the bill.  A friend suggested that I read it and I am so grateful that she did.  I was hooked a few pages in.  About a third of the way through, the protagonist no longer was a character but an actual person to me.  I no longer saw it as fiction... the things, the places, the people, they were all real.  It was heart wrenching.  I stopped reading it for a few days because I didn't want to read about what pain he was about to face.  I couldn't stop thinking about him though during that time, and pressed on reading.  Again, so glad that I did.  I've already started to tell all my friends that they NEED to read this book.
044042321X|4.0|Esse quadrinho &eacute; excelente p/ vc acompanhar a leitura no livro original. Muito melhor enchergando as ações e batalhas. Existe algumas partes que vc gostaria que o desenhista tivesse feito diferente, mas.. não dah p/ agradar a todos neh.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it it can captavate you for hours. get the app well that's it y u now vote for romney
B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter (of Mars) is the best film I've seen in a long time, like someone took all the coolest elements from my favorite sci-fi and fantasy films growing up and combined them seamlessly. I've since started reading the Edgar Rice Burroughs books that it's based on and I'm enjoying those as well. Unfortunately, the film wasn't marketed well but don't let that deter you from giving it a chance!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is really good.  It great to download music and videos and listen to them without Internet connection.Really a great app. If you are always on the road and don't listen to the radio.Then this is a great app for u.
B0086700CM|4.0|its cool but I'm use to it on the ipod cuz the screen is smaller so its a little bit different
B005HSL626|5.0|it is great . me and my fusion have completion's to see. who can get the higher score. it is awesome for me and her,
B007UWBGVS|5.0|I didn't exactly follow him and that particular TV show but when I saw this new album on Amazon with the eye catching cover, I couldn't resist listening to the sample. That got me hooked and my money hooked outta my wallet too. There are plenty of idols, sorry singers, out there with an album, what makes him different is that this is no music that is preppy or poppy. This is really MUSIC to me. Also note that if you buy the album, that digital pdf does not contain any mention of the lyrics, just the usual photos, thanks to and credit.
0345803485|1.0|Is anyone else catching that this guy is a sociopath? Controlling, jealous, isolating.... just remember- Ted Bundy was considered good looking as well. Ana is simpering and the dialogue is terrible. I don't know any educated 20- something year olds who speak like this. Very inauthentic and poorly written.
B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter is an excellent movie.  It is filled with excitement, action, unique visuals, excellent SFX and interesting characters.  The whole family can enjoy John Carter again and again.
B0086700CM|3.0|I was surprised in how difficult this game can get. its a lot of fun, especially with the stuff at the store.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Saw the movie last week. Enjoyed it immensely and realized some of the plot holes people are mentioning is a deliberate mechanism to have plot lines feed into a sequel. A master film maker as Ridley Scott knows exactly what he is doing. Every penny spent is on the screen and the lead actors do a fine job. Glad the riddle of the Space Jockey was solved and while some of the storylines follow a predictable pattern ( nothing is original in this world..just how you treat it )it is things we have come to expect and enjoy.Like a rollercoaster ride.  . . and Charlene did look fabulous!....and now we know in the least where the alien creatures come from and their intended purpose in the whole scheme of things...can't wait for the dvd![[ASIN:B007055JQ8 Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series]]
B005JABSB6|5.0|I purchased 4 of these glasses for my Sharp LED 3D TV.  Works great.  After a quick charge via the micro USB connector, the glasses powered on and work fine.  There are no quirky things to report and when I play a 3D movie for my friends, they are amazed.  The glasses fit nicely on your face.  I am pleased with this purchase and would make it again.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Combining all versions of the masterful sleuth was a brilliant move. It makes for a continued take on Holmes that refreshes the character for the next generation. Buy this movie!
B005HS4CUY|5.0|What a great collection!!  Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Mr and Mrs. Potato head, etc....how can you go wrong with this collection and when its 3D!!!  This is a must for any 3D collection.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Very impressed with this CD and the songs in it. Adam did a great job with this and should be proud. the songs are great and his voice is amazing.
B007R41E8O|1.0|This game should be called Hit the Hint. Hidden objects are truly hidden, unless you have x-ray vision. I wonder if the developers even cared if it would be enjoyable. Plus including the intrusive open feint add-on was the icing on the cake. At 99 cents this app was 98 cents too expensive.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love it but now it wont download so that stinks but now I love it now :) so yeah :) I am board
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it saves the thing I was working on last it is the biggest calculator I have ever seen that is digital and some calculators don't divide but this aclualy does.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome.Been waiting for amazon app store to get this app. Love it :-) Plwy it on my sisters I pad and now I can play it on my kindle fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read for anyone. Perfectly written forbidden love story. I can't get enough! I just want to read the books over and over.
B004FOA84A|5.0|this was my first app and I thought it was great. after I got more apps this<br />one became one of the best ones. would like to get more of the same type.
0439023521|5.0|I finally decided to read Hunger Games and like many readers, I could not put it down....\\"it had me<br />from page one\\".  This is a compelling novel about a government so controlling that it can force teenagers to hunt and kill each other for the entertainment of the ruling class; it is inhuman and brutal.  There is a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness and despair throughout and yet the main characters show morality and compassion and affection.  If one criteria of a \\"good\\" book is that you keep dwelling on it, then for me, Hunger Games qualifies and deserves the popularity it's getting.<br />5 Stars.
B007R41E8O|5.0|this was a great game with a twist at the end that I did not expect,I could not stop<br />until I finished the game. Make More like it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Fifty shades is a filthy, sexy, fantasy/love story. Don't be afraid to read it, its fun and liberating. I was on a flight carrying the book on with me. The stewardess said \\"oh my God are you reading that too...she clutched her hands to her breast and gasped\\" what more can I say!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Me and everyone that I know love this app! it is fun and entertaining for kids and teens. I love how you don't need wifi so we can all play in the car or anywhere we want.
B007SNMVH2|2.0|Boring movie. Despite being a vampire/horror film fan, this new Underworld movie was so boring I had to stop it in the middle and not continue watching. Hughe disappointment!
B00881VLCE|5.0|l recommend this game for anyone who likes puzzles.<br />It is fun and challenging.  I have enjoyed all the different pictures that you have to choose from.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|I am not familiar with earlier Soulsavers albums, but as a big fan of Dave Gahan I simply had to check it out. It's fantastic. I like Gahan's solo albums more than I like 2-3 recent albums from Depeche mode. They have more depth to them, they are more appropriate for his age and state of his life. DM should stop chasing after teenagers, trying to score mainstream hit song and start making music for adults, just like Gahan does. The Light The Dead See is exactly what I'm talking about. Very mature, complete. Great lyrics, great music, great atmosphere. I can't get enough of this album. My favorites: Bitterman, I Can't Stay, Presence of God and Longest Day. Buy this album, you will not regret it. The more you play it, the better it gets.
B00845PV16|2.0|I`m glad I didnt go to the theater to watch this. Graphics ok, but the first one was better. Needs a better plot, and a better producer.
0439023521|4.0|I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first when it came to purchasing this book. I love dystopian novels, but I was not convinced that I could enjoy one targeted towards a younger reading audience. Eventually, after enough good words from friends I decided to give it a try. 3 books later, I am sorry it is over. The Hunger Games trilogy was an easy read. I read all three books in less than 3 weeks. I felt that the author was able to effectively communicate the brutality and harshness of the story perfectly. I would be comfortable allowing my daughter to read the series, yet there was enough detail and emotion that I was able to appreciate it as well. I love that the story is narrated through the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. I felt this allowed the reader to better grasp exactly how the  story affected those involved.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is written in a sort of simpler style, but you must remember that it was geared towards a younger audiences. I felt the end result was a story that beautifully captured the horribleness of the situation without being to graphic. Readers young and old should be able to appreciate what Suzanne Collins has accomplished.
1450419895|2.0|..of muscles used in different exercises, as well as a decent encyclopedia of exercises. The book falls totally short in another aspect, it contains a lot of pseudo science and opinion about the physiology of exercise, essentially derived from the present trainer-oriented, locker room lore of fitness. I recommend Body By Science, by Doug McGuff MD for a real scientific take on exercise, as well as Mike Mentzer's High Intensity Training.
B00881VLCE|4.0|If you love puzzles then you'll love this game. There are many pictures and puzzle sizes to choose from. Great way to pass the time!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game for puzzle lovers! Lots of levels for long game play. Very good on kindle fire. Definitely recommend. Enjoy!
B0086700CM|5.0|simple game and very adicting.  good for all ages my 7 year old loves to play and so do I. the only thing I have a thumbs down on is the prices in the store. I hate when I try so hard and get 700 coins in one round and go to the store hoping I can buy a character but it turns out they cost 25000. you can use real money but I don't want to. only bad thing the rest is perfected
B007CKNX28|5.0|A seamless blend of every kind of musical virtuosity, Jack White's latest offering is unclassifiable and uniquely interesting and enjoyable. Whether you have followed his music over his career or have never listened to him, give this album a try, it is likely to appeal to you in some way.<br /><br />I just listened to it again (and again with a friend). Is it jazz? Rock? Blues? Country? Appalachian? Pop? Is it the 1950's or is it the future? In any case, it's a joyful noise.<br /><br />Jack White is a unique musical genius of our age, the record is full of great melodies, rhythms, harmonies, and lyrics that can range from haunting to raucous. Each song individually is a masterwork and the whole thing coheres.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds! I love it. There's perfect levels and it hasn't crashed yet. The birds are better than ever on this one. Pick it up. The ads dont even bother me.
B007UWBGVS|5.0|From the beginning beats of \\"Trespassing,\\" the title tracks draws you in, with its \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" bass line. Adam's point is very clear, and he gets that point across with his killer vocals and sassy lyrics. I love the groove, the stomp, clap-clap - everything about it. Next is \\"Cuckoo,\\" which is just about getting a little crazy, and is a fun dance song.  Definitely these first two songs should be singles.  Next up is the funky \\"Shady\\" with help from Sam Sparro & Nile Rodgers on guitar, this song is my jam. Every song on this record is my favorite, tbh.  The heart-wrenching rawness of \\"Underneath\\" - in Adam's vocals and lyrics, just KILLS. ME.  \\"Chokehold\\" is very sexy.  You really need to get the deluxe edition for the AMAAAAZZZING bonus extras - \\"Runnin'\\" is just...JUST SO GOOOD you won't even believe it, \\"Take Back\\" is another good one, and \\"Nirvana\\" is the perfect way to end the album with this beautiful lullaby.  GO GET IT! Get some for your friends!
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app is very good for checking yahoo mail and is very quick. There's no crashing with this app and I'm happy with it.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Ok..In my own mind, I am the biggest Rush fan out there, just as all of you are in your minds. But I want to give my honest critique.<br /><br />I truly believe that some of these songs are brilliant and are the best they've done in a long time. The title track is incredible and sparks many great memories from past Rush masterpieces. The Garden is just absoulutely the most beautiful thing they've ever done. There are other gems on here as well.<br /><br />Now, I wasn't a huge fan of Vapor Trails or Snakes and Arrows, my favorite Rush period was from their beginnings up until Counterparts. I found VT and SnA too \\"in your face\\". Not enough downtime in the music to allow me to think about and enjoy what I was hearing. I didn't find melody and, most importantly, dynamics, in those albums and thought the song structures were just not there on many of the songs..not all of them, mind you. I think for a majority of Clockwork, this has much, much improved. But there are stll songs on Clockwork, that follow suit of the previous two. I have to admit, it drives me nuts. However, with that being said....<br /><br />...what works here, REALLLLLY WORKS!! There is some classic Rush on this album!! And by that, I don't just mean songs that remind me of old songs. I'm talking about songs that make me feel like I remember what a Rush song used to make me feel. I'm talking chill inducing, excited, and maybe a little teary eyed. I didn't get any of that from VT and SnA. So I can take the things I'm not sure about from Clockwork and overlook them. Because the good of this album is just THAT GOOD!!<br /><br />Production wise, this CD is an absoulute gem. Musicianship is top notch of course. I think its some of Ged's best bass work in a long time.<br /><br />I have yet to really dive into the concept of the album. But I will definitely take the time to really sit down and read the lyrics (story), as I listen to the music.<br /><br />Keep in mind..this is just one \\"biggest fan's\\" opinion.<br /><br />Favorites so far (after 24 hours of listening)<br /><br />Clockwork Angels (The verses here with Alex's arpeggios are beautiful...exactly what I'd like to see more of)<br />The Anarchist - (Love the middle eastern feel)<br />Halo Effect - (All around great tune)<br />BU2B2 - (Yes, its just a short passage, but I love it. I'd love to see more of this)<br />The Garden - (Jus beautiful)<br /><br />Take my review for what it's worth...which isnt much, as we all have different tastes. But I felt I needed to write out my thoughts so far.<br /><br />AND...LOL...My ultimate final thought on this album. I know I sound critical..I just really love what I love about Rush. But, the fact that I'm still buying Rush albums the first day they come out, just like I have been since the 1980's, is not lost on me. And for that alone, I couldn't be happier and more appreciative.<br /><br />Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, Geddy, Alex, and Neil.
0736420959|4.0|I bought this book for a class that required us to buy a children's book to analyze how children are taught about death through children's book. First of all, i love this movie so i decided to get the book version.<br /><br />The book is great, full of colors and it would be a great book to read as a short bed time story. Its very durable too and nice quality since it isnt a \\"softcover\\"<br /><br />The only thing i wish was that it was a little bit longer and had a little more details, probably because i watched the movie and expected more out of the book but over all its definitely a book i would recommend for children. Its full of nice pictures and dialogue. For this cheap price, $4, on amazon is definitely worth it
B005CGI4EG|5.0|There are some slight differences in the original series and the shows on these disks. Perhaps the shows were edited down because of the time schedules and what the time slot would allow. But the added small bits aren't any more objectionable than the rest of the show. I would suggest to the diehard fan that they look on YouTube or other video spot using the words \\"Married With Children unaired pilot\\". Because there is a single show that hasn't been aired or added to this collection or aired on TV with different actors playing the roles of the two children. But still this is a great collection and almost exactly as I remember it.
B000002JPA|4.0|This is Dream Theater Fan Favorite Album it has hits songs like Pull me under & Another Day & Take the Time.The good thing about Dream Theater is that every album thay have out is Great it's hard to chose whic one is the best.This album is Dream Theater most progressive Type album it as soft songs like Another Day and some progressive songs like Metropolis Part 1 \\"The Miracle And The Sleeper\\" &  under a glass moon.This is good but i like systematic chaos and Awake and metropolis part 2 scenes from a memory and more of ther albums better than this one.Images & Words didnt age that well This album last up to 57 min.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Love this game. Played it on my desktop so I was excited to find it for my kindle fire. Graphics look great on the fire. Have not had any problems with freezing or random reboots. Highly recommend this game.

030758836X|5.0|I always get a warm feeling inside when I come across a book that doesn't quit and keeps you coming back for more. I ignored mostly all of my errands and priorties until I was able to complete this book. The way Flynn switches perspectives between Nick and Amy keeps you on your toes. I don't want to give too much away, but if you're looking for a excuse to ignore your responsibilities for awhile, this book is it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got halfway through the book and just threw in the towel. The characters are unbelievable. The virgin never has even masturbated female character who has supposedly just graduated from an American college in the year 2011, had never owned a computer or even had an email address until this gift from god perfect 26 year old billionaire sexy gorgeous well-endowed athletic trained pilot boy genius Lancelot buys her one so that she can research the \\"Red Room of Pain\\" lifestyle she's apparently going to enjoy the 3rd time she has sex ever. Right. And this guy would be interested in an inexperienced, dull as dishwater girl like her. Not only unbelievable, but just completely dull. I wasn't interested in either of them. The writing is repetitious and just ridiculous with the \\"down there\\" and \\"inner goddess\\", gasping and lip chewing. This is a badly written romance novel.<br /><br />I am just sick this book was even published. It is complete trash. And that people are reading it and giving it 5 stars!! It's just criminal. There should be regulations or something that prevent the masses from even being given access to a book like this. Save us from ourselves regulations. The kind that keep us from acting against our own best interests. I'm embarrassed for them. And a movie??? Seriously? I plan to boycott everyone involved.

B00845PV16|4.0|Some reviewers have called this the worst movie ever.  Sorry - that award goes to 1984's Against All Odds.  Nicolas Cage was cast just right to play Johnny Blaze in both movies, mainly because the Spirit of Vengeance is said to be insane by Moreau and Nic Cage has long proven that he's not all there.  :-)  Violante Placido is absolutely gorgeous, and the fight scenes on the highway aren't bad, either.  If you have an Amazon Prime membership, rent it with Amazon Instant Video and watch it on your computer so you'll only be out $3.99.  Whatta bargain, as Eddie Murphy said long ago.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these for my son's listening pleasure and he found them to be just wonderful.  They fold up for easy storage and have a nice long coiled cord, with gold coated tips on the phone plug.  We liked them so much we are going to get a pair for myself.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|there last one snakes and arrows & this album was to me are 2 pf there best album since presto.id say i love probably 10 of the 12 songs.at least 5 could be played live with there classic hits!gettys voice isnt what it use to be but his voice is mature and sounds great.great riffs,drums,bass and solid song writing.and to me i will be listening to it for years to come and proud to put next to presto<br /><br />and it sounds like most people who dont like the album is because of the compression which i dont blame them.you shouldnt need an audiophile system to have it sound good!luckly my tube amp gives it that added analog sound.<br />BUT if your judging the album quality by mp3s you must be shot in the HEAD!at once!
B004RFYEEC|4.0|I'd heard nearly all the material on the 2 disc set as long ago as 94 on various bootleg sets, however the sound quality on this release is way, way better.<br />I also loved the interviews and the video that was made available on Youtube prior to release, if you haven't already seen it check it out.<br />The only bummer for me was the booklet, very superficial compared to the captitol BB releases. So lose a star for the packaging but overall still a spellbinding set.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|If you are not familiar with Rush's music, I can't tell you what to make of this album.  I am a real admirer of their work as a band.  I like all their stuff and find myself frequenting their \\"synth\\" period most (Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Hold Your Fire) but I also listen to Presto and Roll The Bones a lot as well and Snakes and Arrows and Vapor Trails.  I have read all of Neil Peart's books (with the exception of The Masked Rider) and have watched all of his documentaries.  Just thought a little context would be appropriate.<br /><br />A few years ago Rush released two tracks to this album as singles, Caravan and BU2B (Brought up to Believe).  The tracks are, in short, heavy.  Caravan is based around an addictive, killer riff and a has an all out \\"jam session\\" in the middle instead of the traditional guitar solo.  BU2B is the heavier of the two.  The lyrics and the sonic qualities are a bit of a paradox, but the end result is something better than the individual parts.  Earlier this year the band released another single, Headlong Flight.  A spectacular effort by the Canadian power trio.  Great riff after great riff.  A nice heavy sound.  Powerful and full of great bass.<br /><br />Based on these three songs I was ready for a full album of heavy rock and solid hits.  In actuality, while the album is quite heavy overall for the band, it is remarkably melodic and hints at nostalgia.  Rush has always been a band that firmly planted well outside the mainstream and, for the most part, they will continue their journey in that territory, where they are most comfortable.  But the melodies and guitar parts they laid down for this epic set of songs is laced with the subtle aromatics of the mainstream.<br /><br />The standout on the album is the last track, titled The Garden.  While Rush has their fair share of softer songs (Tai Shan has always been one of my favorites) this one breaks new ground for the band.  Lyrically it is as direct as anything Peart has written.<br /><br />All in all, the band is playing and writing as good, or better, than they ever have..<br /><br />All in all, the band is playing and writing as good, or better, than they ever have.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|I will begin saying that with the premiere of 'Only The Horses' a couple months back - then 'Crazy Love' then 'Kiki'...  I thought it was all pretty awful.  Beginning with 'Horses'...  It sounded like a very lame rehash of something out of the 1990s.  'Crazy Love' just didn't grab me at all.  'Kiki' I just thought was a joke - and seriously didn't think it was a legitimate track off the album.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />The album and how it's sequenced is the real magic here.  I LOVE IT!  'Horses' is pure dance pop fun.  It's a great song to sing along to too.  'Crazy Love' & 'Kiki' are both fun and funny when you really get the lyrics.<br /><br />Melodies - rhythm - all in overdrive.  Again, the sequencing is the real secret here.  The production is great too.<br /><br />This has gone from sounding (to me) like a Jake Shears solo record to a new direction for Scissor Sisters (for me).  It's got everything the past records have but it's a much more seamless production and works very very well.<br /><br />Amazing how giving a disc a couple more spins to really let it sink under your skin works...<br /><br />This is the perfect disc for summer 2012.

B0081HLM2E|4.0|[[ASIN:B0081HLM2E Headhunters]]<br />As a Jo Nesbo fan, I eagerly anticipated the release of the first film I<br />have found based on one of his books..While the film is wonderfully done,<br />reading the book first was essential to maximizing the enjoyment of the<br />film..The texture and fun of the book could not be reproduced..There are<br />just too many ironies and false leads to capture in the time alloted..<br /><br />The author chooses to fool the reader of the book, at least for awhile..<br />Those watching the film can not really imagine all of the plot..What<br />makes most of the action piece together, at least for the bulk of the<br />story, has to be spilled within less than 30 seconds of dialogue as one<br />of the villans, a surprise in itself, tells her understanding of a complex<br />and twisting plot as she confronts the \\"hero\\" before a struggle to the<br />death..Most of what is revealed during this dialogue has been explored in<br />depth to the reader, but just at a glimpse to the viewer..I doubt most of<br />those in the theatre got a keen grasp of that plot revelation, but the<br />pace and fun and gore of the film makes for a memorable moviegoing time,<br />nevertheless..But fun is fun, even if only on the surface of a story much<br />more entertaining to digest slowly, like a great meal served on the page..<br /><br />The fact that our \\"hero\\" has shrewdly set up a solution to be grasped and<br />exploited by a greasy media type drowning in his own narcissism to present<br />to the public a contrived and false explanation of many of the homicides<br />which pop up along the way is again a gem to read about as our \\"hero\\" is<br />removed from both suspicion and prosecution for the mess he has created..<br />The moviegoers would find the scenes themselves both entertaining and<br />part of the resolution of the story, but without the deliciousness of the<br />irony and dark humor that Jo Nesbo has delightfully sent our way, and to<br />my thinking, beyond what can be seen on the screen..<br /><br />Sorry to be so obscure, but I do not wish to give anything away..To those<br />who read first and then watch the story on the screen, the movie is a gem;<br />to those unfamiliar with the book, the movie is fun and worth the time,<br />but a much more shallow experience..After reading, one asks: \\"How on earth<br />are they going to show us this episode??\\" That made the movie exceptional..

0307949486|3.0|This book did not work for me the way I expected, given its mega-success. First off, it's way too long --672 pages instead of a trimmed-down 300 pages which is about all the plot needs. Larsson seems transfixed on minutiae such as mentioning that coffee is served at the beginning of every scene involving dialog. He is a detail person and I suppose lots of mystery fans like that, but it's way too much for me. Despite it's length, the characters are not that interesting. There is virtually no humor. Perhaps that is the Swedish writing style, kind of an Ingmar Bergman pathos. The dialogue is robotic. The girl with the dragon tattoo is the most interesting character, although her childhood which caused her to be a social misfit is barely touched. But the main character, Michael Blomqvist is a bit of a blank in the personality department. There's not much there, there. Too much time is spent on the intricate details and there are too many characters to keep track of -- most of them with the name of Vanger, making it difficult to tell them apart. As a mystery - it's a great plot, but Larsson's writing style lacks the ability to make that plot and particularly the characters interesting to me.
0345803507|1.0|I am a third through this book and feel like throwing it against the wall.  If the author took out all the \\"oh my's\\", \\"inner goddess with her halfmoon glasses blah blah\\", \\"you're mines\\", \\"ah's\\", hands running through his hair, sharp intakes of breath, and ALL the other repetitive lines, the book would be half the size!  EL James has written 3 novels about absolutely nothing apart from 2 immature adults having sex every which way.  Just when you think there's going to be a half decent story line, there's not!  And just when you think the characters might have a night or 2 away from each other, they don't!!  EL doesnt give us a chance to get excited about the two characters being intimate together, she just writes about it too much.  Christian's character is almost likeable but Ana is downright nauseating.  She barely has a personality.  And the bit that gets me is that all three books cover about 6 months from when they first met!!  Ridiculous.  Don't buy these books, you are wasting your money and time.  If you want a good romance novel, the Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons is the single best novel ever written.  Sorry EL James, *sharp intake of breath* you suck!
B00845PV16|4.0|Maybe peoples standards are too high I thought the movie was pretty solid.  The only possible critique I can think of is the idea that the devil's physical form is less powerful than the Rider because he's possessing a mortal host.  Well...  The devil is a fallen angel/demon possessing a mortal host but so is the rider.  They're estranged family in that sense the playing field is a little more level but it should still be tilted in the Devil's favor so physically assaulting the devil should be a bad idea.  The plot was fairly straight forward which I liked.  Often the over complicated plots don't work and the script gets so wild they're less satisfying and a guy with a flaming skull for a head seems perfectly sensible in comparison.<br /><br />I thought it was a fun ride.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been waiting for years to hear a breakthrough album like this from Rush. If you are an old school Rush fan and have not been checking in on their music of late, now is the the time. I'm on my first listen to the new album, and this has an edge, creative, interesting sounds, and killer bass and drum. The vocals are better sounding with good harmonies and not doing too much. The guitar shreds and fills out the sound nicely. I hope you enjoy this creative outburst from a band I have always enjoyed listening to. Thank you RUSH!

034580404X|3.0|So aside from the books themselves this box set sucked. The actual \\"box\\" part of it is extremely cheap and flimsy. I'd compare it to the thickness and rigidity of a manila folder. Twilight and Hunger Games has nice boxed sets why couldn't they have done a better job with this? If it wasn't for the fact that it was cheaper to buy the boxed set instead of the individual books I would definitely not recommend buying this.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie was simply amazing. It was one of the most touching and thoughtful movies I've seen in a while. Needless to say the action was non stop.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|A lot of this movie is just more metallic menace from outer space. However, there's a larger dose of humanity here than you usually find in movies heavy on explosive special effects. People have solid, individual presences, holding their own amid all the mechanical sound and fury. There are actually some humorous and heartfelt moments along the way - and even a lovably bumptious love story. How far would YOU go to get the girl of your dreams a chicken burrito?<br /><br />And then there's the last phase of the battle. That's bound to bring a tear to the eye of even those movie-goers most averse to the genre of Star Wars extravaganzas. The ending is something special.<br /><br />I do wish they would have provided a somewhat more valid justification for the necessity of that ending. I also wish they would have played up more of its details - showing more of the process that would have been involved in launching the final attack. Also, the people who play the biggest part in the touching resolution are oddly not mentioned when the military brass hands out kudos. That's a galling omission that detracts from the film's making a point of honor.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the ending, flawed as it is, is still bound to thrill viewers, especially members of \\"the greatest generation\\" or anyone closer to the time of those veterans who fought the previous \\"Great War.\\" So while a wide range of people can find something to enjoy in this film, whether it be the metallic blasts or the love story - this DVD might especially thrill dads and granddads - and would make an evocative present for them.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Sherlock Holmes was one of my favorite movies of 2009, so my expectations for this film were high. I was not disappointed in the least. Though the first film was tighter, I enjoyed this one far more. Game of Shadows has a very ambitious plot, that falters somewhat half way through. Holmes and Watson's trip to Germany, while host to the most exciting scene in the movie, is a bit cluttered story wise. Everything makes sense, but it isn't until the end of the movie that you find out why.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is compared to Benedict Cumberbatch, star of the excellent BBC show \\"[[ASIN:B004132I20 Sherlock: Season One [Blu-ray]]]\\", a comparison which I find unfair. While Cumberbatch is indeed brilliant in his portrayal, Downey is equally so in a completely different way. Their performances are apples and oranges, with the only similarities being that you will enjoy both. Jude Law, once again, shines as Watson. Him and Downey have chemistry, the likes of which I have never seen on film. The term bromance is tossed around too frequently these days, but it fits Holmes and Watson to a tee.<br /><br />The villain of this film, Moriarty, played to perfection by Jared Harris, elevates an already entertaining film to something with some weight behind it. He is a foe of intelligence on par with Holmes and the game they play is fascinating to behold. While there may be one too many action sequences, the fight at the stag party, and the always wonderful Noomi Rapace is given nothing of real importance to do, this is, as stated above, an unfailingly fun, and wonderfully enjoyable movie, well worth your time and hard earned dollar. Highly Recommended.
B0086700CM|3.0|the game in general is very fun but on the kindle fire it freezes to much I don't want to uninstall b/c of other comments on how it wont reinstall...
1590171993|5.0|I tend to dislike alot of contemporary fiction - but this book has a simplicity, directness, and complete lack of contrivance which masks the deep level of craft.  It is very similar in form to the authors epistolary historical novel Augustus - both tell the story of a lonely, stoic man struggling to maintain meaning in an often-hostile and hypocritical world - but Stoner is the deeper book precisely because of the simplicity of the account.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|Forget about wishing them well. Another jumbled mess. Geddy, quit singing so high. You're voice doesn't sound good high anymore. Yet, a few good songs on the album...'The Garden' and 'The Wreckers\\" are keepers. The rest, throw aways. Tis a shame cuz there are some good parts in practically every song. But, now, now! Taken as a whole....that's another story. That's where the word 'lame' comes to mind. Take the beginning of 'Carnies' for instance. I swear if that doesn't sound like a sixty nine dollar Zoom pedal from Musician's Friend, I don't know what does. Yet, the chorus on that song isn't half bad. Very begining of 'Seven Cities of Gold'...not bad...the rest of it..barf city. And that hyped up title track, 'Clockwork Angels' dissapointed me the most. Can't stand it when bands include old crap (Caravan, BU2B) on new albums. Geddy, you really should listen to a few Billy Joel albums before you go about writing the next album. You know, just to keep you from straying too far from what a melodic song should sound like. Or even better, pull out some of your OWN albums. Anything before 'Presto' would do fine. I'm gonna say it again. Fire that producer. He isn't helping at all. I recently listened to Slash's new album and thought it was produced very well even though I didn't care for the music all that much. You should see about getting that person to produce your next album if Terry Brown is not available. In summary, a couple of new Rush songs to add to my collection, but once again I get that feeling of dread that Rush has come and gone with another crappy album.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|This TV mini-series really gets the zombie genre better than a lot of zombie films do. A great concept that was surprisingly well executed. Not sure how this got produced, must have been a fortuitous fluke, but the film-makers really captured the nail-biting, claustrophobic fear like only the best zombie films have pulled off. Sure, one or two characters are a bit over the top but I guess that is a prerequisite British TV, right?

B005TF06H8|4.0|The material is more geared toward college than high school students... kind of reminds me of the later episodes of Buffy. The torturous violence gets a little old as well. Other than that, the series is a fun one. The story lines hold your interest and develop better than the books do. The television series is better, in my opinion. I really hope Elena ends up with Damon. I weary of Stephan and his stupid decisions. Alpha up, man!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The fact that Rush can produce Vapor Trails, Snakes and Arrows and now Clockwork Angels thirty plus years INTO THEIR CAREER is outrageous!! Production problems aside, VP was outstanding, S&A even better and now the latest, Clockwork Angels, a masterpiece. The opening salvo of Caravan and BU2B, even though they were released earlier for the Time Machine tour, are stronger versions here. The title song is my favorite so far. Headlong Flight and Seven Cities Of Gold are epic Rush, The Wreckers has a chorus that will stay in your head all day, FM radio will crave it. Wish Them Well is a positive, uplifting precursor to the finale...the most unexpected Rush song, perhaps ever, The Garden. This album being a concept of a lifelong journey, ending it with bombast would not have fit. It should end with reflection, peace, perhaps solace... in your place of comfort...your garden. I hope they play the album in its entirety for the upcoming tour, Clockwork Angels deserves to be heard as you'll hear it here.<br /><br />PS...As for those ridiculous calls for Rush in the RRHOF?? Who cares? I think the band actually wears the snub like a badge of honor anyway...and who gets into rock and roll to be in any hall of fame??

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I wrote a blow-by-blow account of the album's music yesterday on my website, which I won't repost here. However, I WILL say that, despite the fact that this is easily as heavy an album as the last four or five outings, I also think it's the most melodic, diverse, progressive thing they've recorded since at least Hold Your Fire, and probably going back to--dare I say it--Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures. It's not a hoary old prog classic in the vein of 2112 or Hemispheres, but it IS a highly listenable concept album that doesn't sound dated or out of character for the band that Rush is today.<br /><br />I also don't like giving five star reviews, because I don't want people to get the impression I'm too easily impressed. However, this album has everything I wanted from a Rush album in 2012, so I can't help but give it the high five. My review draws favourable comparisons to past albums, but in no way do I think this album is derivative or lost in time. It's a fantastic song cycle. Just listen to it with open ears and a willingness to accept that they can still play all those classics, but they aren't going to deliberately repeat those albums, no matter how hard we wish for it. Considering how uncharacteristically hook-laden-and-yet-progressive this album is, why would we want them to?
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is just porn and I don't get the hype. There are parts that are very arrousing. I read that the movie rights have been sold. Wow, how how will they do that and maintain the integrity of the story? I don't think I'm a prude, but this gets boring after a point. So far I haven't wanted to read the sequels.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Will Neil's well for surprises ever run dry? With this twist of the Great American Songbook brought about by his ragged comrades-in-rhythm, Crazy Horse, perhaps not. I must confess it's slightly off-putting at first, but by opening up after half a dozen listens, it grows stronger and stronger into what can actually be deemed a classic Neil Young album. Except for his lovely acoustic-based \\"Wayfarin' Stranger\\", this record feels like the studio version of \\"Weld\\" where everything rocks in that Crazy Horse lumbering mode. Having absorbed the rock and roll, folk and country idioms during his formative years in Canada, it makes complete sense for him to do renditions of \\"Oh Susannah\\" and \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" his way. And they're outstanding. With \\"High Flyin' Bird\\", they do an adaptation in which they revisit the arrangement from Neil's very first band, the Squires. They also bring an already superb fifties uptempo doowop, \\"Get A Job\\", and validate it into the twenty-first century. Neil's historical synopsis of each song in the liner notes further proves his love for these songs while having loads of fun playing them. And it really comes through in the music. Neil's lead and the background vocals from the band speak volumes too. Conceivably, he might not get away with this concept a second time unless he goes the \\"Comes A Time\\" or \\"Harvest\\" route. Until then, give this a shot and rock out to it by a campfire.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I was 10 years old in 1977 and when I saw Star Wars for the first time that summer, I walked out of the theatre thinking I just saw something magical. John Carter captures that same movie magic with a great story, great characters and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino. Where Star Wars is Wagnerian space opera, John Carter is more of a personal journey of the central character. I'm glad this movie kept Edgar Rice Burroughs' original setting of Carter as a 19th century Civil War vet and they didn't try and modernize everything. This is an old-fashioned adventure/romance story that gives you a great feeling of nostalgia for a long lost time and place.
030758836X|2.0|As an English degree major, one of the most common refrains from professors is, don't necessarily trust the voice of a first-person narrator.  And, what happened in this book is the first-person narrative of the female protagonist, Amy, doesn't create a very sympathetic character right from the start.  You are meant to empathize with her and if not dislike, deeply distrust the male protagonist, Nick.  She comes off as spoilt, a narcissist, and seems to have a very all-over-the place personality, and apparently the ability to hold unbelievable grudges.  Unfortunately, the opposite happened for me.  It just felt like a set-up the entire time.  And, literary tricks and twists when handled this clumsily, leading to the latter two portions of the book, being read just to align truths, lies, and the somewhere in-betweens.<br /><br />I actually felt mentally and emotionally dirty after reading this book.  Even in the most depressing of books that are even a mediocre read, there are some redeemable qualities about the characters.  I felt neither of these two characters were even remotely redeemable and I walked away feeling like I had just met two of the most loathsome people in the world.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is massive. It's thick, creative, lyrical, purposeful and colorful. There are no duds on this album, and I can spot a Rush dud from a mile away, having identified at least one on every album since Grace Under Pressure. I highly recommend that you listen to it as an album at first, whether you link up the mp3s or buy the CD.
B0088LU3P0|4.0|People who say this season sucks need to watch this episode. The paradox between several differant characters tonight were utter brilliance. Especially the one between Don and Glen.

Don and Joan are both put in a no win situation in which both make a decision and say stuff they shouldn't. The sad part is,pretty sure I would have handled the situation worse. It made for a lot of good conversation with other people about some heavy topics. It was nice to see Betty acting like a mom for once. I thinks Betty gets that her kid is pulling away and she better fix it. My one complaint was that they should have explained the commissions and fees jargon meeting. Not all of us are executives , just saying.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|The male character of this book has serious issues with violence and dependency.  It's not a good book for young women to read.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I was wondering if there is an auto sync for the buisness calendar. I looked and looked to no avail. If its in there can someone please help out.<br /><br />Thanks,
B00846WWVM|4.0|this game works really really well on the kindle fire. its really fun and challenging although when I got it, it was marked down. I don't think it is worth 1.99 so if u r gunna get it, wait until its marked down again.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|the product was delivered in time and i have been enjoying value for this product since i purchased it.the tracks are marvellous and shows the ingenuity of celine dion.thanks
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love this app I spend my day Playing this game its very addicting I really recommend this app!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. it has cool prehistoric animals and items. I am at level 18 now and it is more awesome by the minute. I love it and you don't wi-fi.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! IT MAKES U THINK ALOT AND THIS GAME DOESNT HAVE ISSUES!!!! IT DOESNT FREEZE AND TAKE 5 HOURS 2 LOAD!!! I LOVE IT
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|This product is wonderful because it contains the classic princesses mixed with one of the new ones.  My disney princess fanatic loved them!
B0086700CM|4.0|I recently got this app when it was featured as the app of the day.  I was reluctant to play because of the various hyper that I had heard about the game, bit was not disappointed.<br /><br />The object of the game is to run as far and long as you can without getting eaten by the temple monkeys, falling into the water, stumbling on a tree, catching on fire or faceplanting into a beam.  The further you run, the harder the course becomes.<br /><br />As you run you are able to collect coins, which you can use in the store to purchase items that make your run easier.  You are also able to purchase additional coins for items with real currency.<br /><br />The first few times you play this the game may come across as frustrating and and lame, bit stick with it...I'm sure you'll become addicted to beating your high score in no time at all!<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can only play this game with an Internet connection.  It would be nice to be able to play this offline as well.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Finally I found a puzzle app that is jigsaw and not the square style. If you like jigsaw puzzles this is a great app. Plenty of free puzzle packs and a ton if you don't mind spending $.99 for more. Many options for pieces to use for varied difficulty. Best jigsaw app on Appstore.
B0086700CM|5.0|I looooove it I just cant stop playing. its so additive. I spend a lot of time trying to get as far as I can; kinds hard tho but I guess that's the beauty of the game
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I was looking everywhere for this DVD for my Mom for her birthday and Amazon came through like they always do and I got it for a really good price and it made my Mom's birthday! :)

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|What a wonderful read! I loved it and devoured it in two days. This book got my husband reading late into the night rather falling asleep in front of the TV. He actually dropped a f-bomb when i told him book 2 was not out yet and had to wait.
B001W79MB8|5.0|I received the item in perfect condition. I as well as plenty of my friends and family have enjoyed it. There were a couple instances when the movie stopped for a second, but it was only while watching on my player, so it very well might have something to do with my player and not the movie. All-in-all, a very good buy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't really read books but everyone was talking about this book so I had to pick it up. I have to say as soon as I started reading I could not stop untill I finished it. The author did an amazing job on hooking you in and waiting more!!! This is the best book I ever read
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book series sucks. I dont't understand the hype. I was encouraged to buy these books by a number of friends and I am now considering whether they were truly my friends. The repetition, tiresome sex scenes and lack of any story line has placed these book for me as the worst I've ever read. I will be reading more reviews before I purchase anymore books in the future, this series at least made me learn this lesson.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. me and my sister fight over it. I love how u can change people. get it now :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I couldn't put this game down when I first got it. With every additional update, I find myself having that same level of fun.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|If you're a Joe Walsh fan this CD is a must-have.  It's loaded with the classic Walsh sound we grew to love and also with life lessons from someone who's been around the block a few times.  BUT IT.
0553573403|5.0|Basically every other 5 star review in here is what I have to say. The story is rich and totally engrossing. The characters are complex and realistic. The 800 pages seem to fly by while you get lost in a tale of politics, murder, romance and war. The main thing about this book is that although it is labeled as fantasy, it really doesn't read that way to me. Normally I would not pick up a fantasy novel, they just don't do it for me, but after hearing all the buzz about the show on HBO I thought I would try to read the book before starting the show. I starte it a few days ago and I haven't been able to put it down. I'm staying up till 4 in the morning to read this book and then going to work at 7....it's worth it!  Just sayin, if you are like me and are normally put off by a fantasy title, just do yourself a favor and give this a chance to hook you in. I can gaurantee most people will NOT be disappointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game! It is a little difficult to get the hang of at first, but once you do it's nonstop fun!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love jigsaw puzzles. This app works really well on my Kindle Fire. There are lots of free puzzles. I will say it did seem that your finger hit the add button quite a bit. Overall I believe it was worth it.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|Sure, the sets look dated and some of the acting isn't perfect, but the incredible musical score, engaging space battle scenes and iconic performance by Ricardo Montalban as Khan, earn this film a permanent place among the great science fiction films of all time.  As is always true, skip the Director's Cut. Editors are well paid to do their job, and this movie is no exception. As if the film weren't great enough on its own, it makes a terrific sequel to the Space Seed episode from the original series, with Montalban playing the same role in both shows.<br /><br />If you geek out on the music, like I do, the soundtrack to Star Trek III is perhaps even a bit better.  James Horner's best score (yes, even better than Aliens).
B0006AAS5G|1.0|Don't buy this product. about one week after i bought this watch, I was trying to adjust the time, the adjusting pin came out, which I could never fix. Why should it be so fragile when i paid $100? the look was good though
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is super fun u should get it its really really AMAZING!!!!!!! You should get it NOW!!!! So get it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I find myself thinking about this game all the time! Fun and witty. I enjoy the sour effects too! you can name your charcters too
0439023491|5.0|Well I'm exhausted!It's 1:22pm and I have just finished reading Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2). I do not want to give too much away to those who haven't read the book, but I must tell you this: I deliberately cancelled my purchase of the final book,Mockingjay, and almost didn't purchase this series due to negative reviews. I'm glad I trusted my own instincts and those tasteful persons who loved the book and gave positive reviews.Thank You!<br /><br />Amazing, fresh, different! Just a few of the wods that I can use to describe it!Peeta is every girl's dream. Katniss is raw and real.She is believable and her attitude is just in tune with what is expected of a person who has endured starvation, death and desolation! I am now struggling to purchase the final book in the series, and have it shipped here to Barbados.I want it now!!!!!!Can't Wait!<br /><br />Enjoy, Readers!!
B007MAETA8|5.0|After a couple disastrous personal years Mayer has produced what is his best album yet. It's rare to find an artist who is a brilliant songwriter, fantastic singer and stellar musician. He is the total package. Although he doesn't show off his killer chops on this album, his skill is ever present. This is one of those albums you just can't stop listening to.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first read the sample of this book from the kindle store. This is where the obsession began. The next day I decided to buy it simply because my mind would not stop traveling through the silo. That night I purchased Wool, I had made dinner and wanted to eat while I dove into my first book in six months. In less time than seemed possible I was a quarter of the way through Wool and none of the way into my cold dinner.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works really well. I play it all the time. I like that there's an option to receive playing tips.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|Doesn't give you much in terms of what you need to do, or how to jump-start on it.  Quite disappointed considering the reviews I read on here.  All I needed was one story to tell me why having a habit is powerful...instead, the entire book consists of 5-6 different stories with the same purpose.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This is the strongest album Rush has released since 1985's Power Windows (in my humble opinion).  I say this because it is the only Rush album in the last 27 years that I feel maintains its consistency from start to finish.  After 3 complete listens it occurred to me that this band is not ready to hang it up yet.<br /><br />My favorite tracks:<br /><br />The Anarchist<br />Carnies<br />The Wreckers<br />Headlong Flight<br />The Garden
B00846TTDG|4.0|I am retired military and can tell you the action scenes in this flick are VERY realistic. The acting/dialogue on the emotional bits can be a little tight but this movie is about the fight. If you want to know what our special forces guys do - this movie gives you a peak into their world.
B0086700CM|5.0|Be careful! This game is extremely addictive! I've never had so much fun running through a temple. The download is a little big, but worth it in the end.
B007L5KT76|5.0|I am a huge RDJ fan and he plays the crafty, snarky Holmes very well. The action scenes are wonderful and the plot has delightful twists and turns. Great, rich cinematography and use of color. Thumbs way up!
1936608898|5.0|If you want to do one good thing for yourself today, read It Starts With Food and follow Dallas and Melissa's guidelines and don't look back.  I haven't.  This book presents the science and practice of healthy eating as part of a healthy lifestyle. It really does start with food. I have not seen this information so well presented anywhere else.  Kudos, Dallas and Melissa.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining. I heard from some of the purists that they missed some of the elements that are present in the book. Since I didn't read the book, I wasn't hampered with expectations. I really enjoyed the action, the cinematography and the effects. There were cute bits to the dialogue and endearing characters. The women were hot AND fierce and truly co-starred with the hero. A great movie when you like sci-fi and just want to escape for a bit.
B002OSY2T6|2.0|My husband picked up this toy at Kohls because it caught my 4 month old's attention.<br /><br />Thankfully I had a 30% coupon so I didn't spend a whole lot on it (maybe $9).<br /><br />I was looking at buying my son a mirror anyway. And I liked how this toy had a large age range (3-36 months).<br /><br />The flashing light and sounds do catch my son's attention. However we can't seem to keep thing thing standing up. It probably spends 90% of playtime face down. The littlest bump and it falls. My son is now starting to crawl and I can't imagine it standing up long enough to be pushed with him.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this toy. It's a good idea...but poorly constructed. I often look at it and wonder why Fisher Price didn't make it more of a ball shape so it had more of a chance of standing like it is supposed to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVE THE BOOK SOOOOO MUCH! It is definitely one of my favorite books of all times!<br /><br />It has changed me a lot!<br /><br />I recommend reading it! and i promise you will never want to put it down!
B007SGM084|5.0|EL James is a fantastic writer. I can't put the book down. It is a true love story albeit on a taboo topic. It just astounds me, I can sense the emotions in the words. Great book, can't wait to go to the next one.
B006NXI58M|4.0|I was not sure how the author could continue to make these books interesting after the action of the first one.  But this one does not disappoint, it is gripping and it was nice to escape in the world she has created.  Before reading the series I did not have high expectations and thought the books were aimed at young adults, I had also not seen the movie so had no idea what to expect.  These books are all well written and keep you on the edge of your seat,  I did not feel condescended to and really enjoyed the read.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. I love it and can watch it over and over again. Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman (most beautiful woman in the world-even by today's standards). I got the kids to watch it, and they loved it as well. This movie is great for the whole family. How many movies can you say that too, not many.<br /><br />Perfectly cast with Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. All at the top of their game. A real plus for any movie collection Please keep this classic a classic by renting/buying it today. You will not be sorry
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds both turn in great performance as CIA operatives.  Denzel had gone rogue ten years ago and has a file that will expose many transgressions by the CIA and other agencies worldwide.  When Denzel is brought to the Safe House Ryan is in charge of protecting, Ryan finds that escaping with Denzel may be the less evil of the alternatives when the Safe House is breached.  Denzel will use any method to escape and Ryan must figure out a way to bring him in alive. The movie is full of action right up to the conclusion when both men must fight for their lifes.  If you enjoy the spy genre, this one should be on you list to rent and then quite possibly buy.  If you enjoyed this you may enjoy another [[ASIN:B00004TJJS Safe House]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I'm a big fan of Alien and Aliens, thought Alien 3 was decent at best and really hated Resurrection, so with Ridley Scott taking us back to the start of the series, Prometheus was one of the top films I was looking forward to in 2012.<br /><br />The plot is mostly about the creation of life on Earth and where we came from. The events take place about 30 years before Ripley and her crew land on a neighboring planet, where they find the same huge alien species that suffered the same fate here. Yes it is confusing at times (hence the four star rating), but I did manage to have most of my questions answered on that one big movie site (ya know the one). It does tarnish the mystery element of the Space Jockey from the first film, but I didn't think it took away anything from the series either. Maybe it didn't reach my high expectations as a whole, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />The acting from Noomi Rapace (the new Ripley, or is it the old?) and Michael Fassbender (the new Ash/Bishop android) stole the show. Both were very convincing. Charlize Theron also added quite a bit as well.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D visuals were clear and impressive. None of the CGI looked bad...well the last minute or so could have been less blurry. You'll know the iconic moment when you see it.<br /><br />I read that Ridley Scott said he will be releasing the Blu-ray with 20 extra minutes. Like Kingdom of Heaven, I think this will elevate the movie even farther than this shorter cut.<br /><br />Smart, beautiful, intense and full of questions to ponder over long after you have left the theater, Prometheus is one of the strongest Sci-Fi films I've seen in a long time.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|but its lost in all of the distortion... I was going to wait to write a review but decided to go ahead and post this but will update after i have given it some more spins. I noticed my ears were just getting tired after a few songs like with Vapor Trails. I ripped a few of the tracks to wav files and opened them in Audacity and sure enough, the songs are clipping all over the place. I can't believe they did this again...<br /><br />And it just seems to me that Alex's playing is lost in all of the distortion, except for the solos, and some of the vocals just get lost in the mix.<br /><br />I will say that \\"The Garden\\" is a breath of fresh air on this disc. Like I said, i will give it a few more listens and then update this review. But the clipping kills the experience.

B007FH9GT2|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. If you don't believe me, just watch it. Heads up: intense rape scene. It's creepy but a necessary part of the main character's story.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Any Sophie Kinsella book is a real good read, especially now that it is summer reading time.  Her choice of words, insights and surprise endings always keep me wanting more.  I enjoy some of the British every day words that we do not use in the States...we all now know the word \\"fastener\\" for a hat etc.  As Kinsella's characters get even deeper in messes and seem as though they will never get out of a situation you are gob (her word, a British phrase) smacked when the unexpected happens.  I have read her books in paperback form and on my Kindle Fire. (As an aside I love my Kindle Fire)- I also like the books she has written under her REAL NAME, Madeleine Wickham. I highly recommend this book, one of the better lite reads I've read in awhile.  Prepare yourself for laughter!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|A challenging game that keeps your mind working. The only thing that I dont like is that you have to do all the pages again if you lose a level.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wanted to read it in one night because I just had to know... y'know?  Wow. Talk about dysfunctional relationships. Good, weird, entertaining read.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|It had it's ups and downs but at the end I loved it. Not as good as the other 2 but a very good ending. Definitely made you want more.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought it to see what all the hype was about.  This book is not for a woman who likes to be in control or has had a controlling relationship.  Although it is somewhat of a love story, it is not my kind of love story.  I am far from a prude and have read my share of adult books. This left me empty.  I didn't even finish it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I had no ideal when I downloaded this game I would spend so many hours playing! I love this game!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|please add me i need neighbors --gummaybearz would be great!!! ty very much guyssss i will add anyone and everyone who sends me a request and thid game is great!!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|It's not every day that you find a new twist on an old story that really works. I have never come across this view on vampires and shape shifters before; its pretty cool and inventive. There was nothing about the plot that was predictable, the characters were well defined and multidimensional, the romance was steamy, the action was intriguing and exciting...truly a must read.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|First and foremost, I don't truly believe there could ever be a successful sequel to The Phantom of the Opera. Andrew Lloyd Webber set the bar so high the first time, it's very hard to meet or exceed the expectations in a sequel.<br /><br />The set is beautiful, the costumes and performances are striking and dramatic. By many measures, this is a good show. My biggest problem with Love Never Dies is that the characters have changed too much to be believable.<br /><br />The Phantom has gone soft. He killed, controlled, manipulated, stalked, and terrorized people before. Now we're supposed to believe he's this sentimental softie who makes bargains with Raoul? I don't think so. And speaking of Raoul, who is this lazy, unsupportive drunk? I didn't even recognize his character this time around. I didn't find Christine likable at all and didn't even feel any real sympathy for her character. I guess the only character I did connect with was the child, Gustave, and even he could have been developed more.<br /><br />I realize this takes place 10 years later and people can certainly change. But for the sake of consistency, protagonists and antagonists should not change drastically in the second installment. At least not at first. If their personality changes or evolves throughout the story, that's expected. But opening up a show with characters who are new versions of themselves is usually a bad idea. This makes it more difficult for the audience to identify (and re-identify) with the characters they've known before.<br /><br />There are treats throughout the show that give a subtle nod to Phantom fans. Musical notes and lyrics have been borrowed from the first one to give a sense of familiarity to this one. It's somewhat fun to go through and identify them. You'll find yourself saying, \\"Oh, I recognize that song! It samples such-and-such.\\"<br /><br />Other than a general sense of familiarity, most of the songs are forgotten as soon as the show is over. The only one I've found stuck in my head was \\"The Beauty Underneath,\\" which really stood out to me. It was dark and powerful while reminiscent of the original Phantom theme.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Phantom, you must see this. You may not love it, but how could you not want to see what happens next?<br /><br />As far as sequels go, I really think Andrew Lloyd Webber did the best any one could do. Like I said, the first one is hard to top and I don't think it ever could be topped. So this is about as good as it gets, and even better than I'd expected! Bravo for that.stuck in my head was \\"The Beauty Underneath,\\" which really stood out to me.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I have invested considerable time and money in the first four books of this series.<br />I really enjoyed the first three, but the fourth book was a disappointment<br />.<br />Despite the negative reviews for the fifth book, I was still prepared to purchase it.<br />UNTIL I saw the price tag.<br /><br />$14.99 for an e-book?<br />Really?<br /><br />I vote with my wallet and until the price is reduced Random House can go pound sand.<br />I bet they are the mummers that convinced Martin to stretch this farce to seven books to increase their profit$$$<br /><br />I still love Amazon.com and I wish they had more control over pricing.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This app can read your account information and has full internet access. Why? What data are they collecting and who do they send it to? Why would an app that lets you read a book (the Bible) need that? And why can't you turn it off? Looks like a scam to collect personal information. Just saying.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|with my first baby, i must have bought 50 pacifiers because we always lost them...these are pretty hard to loose and my second daughter can put them in her mouth easily. the one night i put her to bed with out it, just a normal pacifier, she woke up screaming in the middle of the night because she couldn't find it...never made that mistake again and she hasn't woken up in the middle of the night since.  and i put mine in the dishwasher...sanitizes and cleans perfectly. squeeze out the water, and put in a towel for a little bit and it is dry.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This could have been much better but half way through the book I was wishing the book would get to the point already. Also the book is very repetative which is very annoying. Its like both the female and male leads of the story don't have any other words to convey their feelings but the limited ones they always use through out the book.. The idea of the story was interesting but was not well done. Also Christian grey the male lead in the story is too bossy for my taste. He's a turn off for me. Sure he may be hot and wounded but abusive, which is a huge red flag!
B007YA5NRO|4.0|I had owned the Fuji X10 for six months and felt the guide would not help much in taking advantage of the camera.  Still doubting, I went ahead and got the book.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprise to learn a few things that were not entirely clear to me, which made the price of the eBook worthwhile.  The X10 is a compact but advanced camera, and it's up to the photographer to set its many options, which are not always obvious.<br /><br />The guide is well written and illustrated.  I recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game very fun and cute!! The adventures are great! I like all the cute effects they've added! just downloaded it today and hooked already!!
0307913147|5.0|Ready Player One absolutely blew me away, and took me by complete surprise. I was pretty sure that I would like it, but I wasn't expecting to LOVE it so much. It's easily one of my favorite reads/listens of 2012, and is now on my favorites bookshelf. This book is full of fantastic nerdy-ness, and Ernie Cline's world building is incredible! If you're a fan of late 20th century pop culture, then this is THE book for you. I couldn't help but feel nostalgic while listening to this audiobook, and loved every minute of it!<br /><br />Ready Player One takes place in a dystopian future where essentially human kind has sucked the planet dry of natural resources. Their escape is the OASIS, a virtual world where as avatars they can work, play, go to school, socialize, and hunt for the \\"egg\\" in the game to win Halliday's fortune - all while being completely anonymous.<br /><br />It wasn't much of a jump for me to think that our society could end up plugged into a virtual world in the not-so-distant future. I liked how there was emphasis on facing the world, meeting people in real life, and focusing on what is real. I love how Wade's character started off as being completely isolated, then established true friendships, and even fell in love along his quest.<br /><br />Whil Wheaton as the narrator was fantastic! I don't think there could have been a more perfect narrator chosen for this book! I was a little surprised that Books on Tape didn't use sound bytes for classic noises (Pac-Man, game over, etc.) but Wheaton did a pretty good job at making the sounds himself. It was probably safer to not include the actual sound, as it may have sounded cheesy or over the top.<br /><br />Ready Player One is most definitely an adult/YA crossover title; though I'm not sure teens will be able to appreciate all the references. If you're a fan of the 80's, dig pop culture from the mid-70s to present day, and enjoy a good quest, I think you'll LOVE this book! I highly recommend Ready Player One, in print, and most definitely the audio version!in print, and most definitely the audio version!

0143123173|3.0|The Cold Dish, is a good mystery and a certainly better than average debut.  Like most writers of mystery series, Mr. Johnson invest a lot of effort in pointing out to his readers that his protagonist is quirky, in a nonchalant, self-deprecating and endearing sort of way and like most writers he way overdoes it.  (If brevity is the soul of wit, then subtlety and nuance are the soul of originality.) He also really, really wants his readers to know that he is well-read, so he liberally sprinkles references to great writers and classic novels throughout the story.  However, all the references are either passing or glancing and are contrived to the point that they are distracting and even silly.<br /><br />The main problem I have with The Cold Dish is the callused attitude of Wyomingites (or at least the denizens of Absaroka County) have toward the violent gang rape of a handicapped child.  If Johnson's depiction of how crimes like this are treated is at all representative of reality, then people with young and/or handicapped daughters should be advised to stir well clear the state of Wyoming.  The clumsy literary references were merely annoying, this problem underlies the entire novel and buttresses the whole plot.  I never bought into the idea that such a heinous crime would be so lightly treated and its perpetrators so light punished.  I think the story would have worked much better if the rapists had been acquitted of the original crime.  But a two year sentence with time off for good behavior for the violent gang rape of a disabled minor?  Didn't buy it.  Sorry Mr. Johnson, you wrote a very good book but, for me, this marred the whole effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked this book very much and will read the next in the series and probably many more.  Did I mention that I have a copy of The Adventure of  Huckleberry Finn in my office and my favorite book is To Kill a Mockingbird?

B007PVHBHC|3.0|I feel alot of fans of particular artist are afraid to give critical feedback because they feel it's a contradiction to their fandom. I disagree. I'm looking so far at 11 5 star reviews of Banga and I just can't vibe with that. There are some good tracks here for sure, but those who call this a musical comeback (that would imply a comeback to the passion and energy of her 70's work.) are simply misleading. This is No \\"Horses\\" and further than that this isn't even on the level of \\"Wave\\" which is my least favorite of her 70's material.<br />Let me get to the standout tracks here-<br />Amerigo- is a beautiful opener with spoken word cut in and out of singing<br />April Fool-A very pop friendly track<br />This is the Girl-A tribute to Amy Winehouse<br />Banga-The most energetic track on the album sadly enough.<br />Maria-A beautiful balladesque track<br />After the gold rush-stellar cover of neil young.<br />So 6 out of 12 tracks are worth the price and wait of the cd. the rest I have to admit are boring and bleed into the background despite one trying to push it to the center of attention. The reason? Who can relate to these topics? patti use to evoke emotion with literary refrence now she just provokes boredom with it.
B000002JPA|1.0|i recently listened to this for the first time since the 1990s. i have remained very familiar with \\"Pull Me Under\\", but i was puzzled why i hadnt given this CD a spin in over 18 years!<br />oh, thats why - BECAUSE IT SUCKS. wtf - rock vaudevillian music? meandering symphonies that tire and sure, are at a fierce meter and therefore difficult to play w/ perfection, but sound like absolute drivel.<br /><br />the cd rests in the trash bin at this moment. i actually endured the whole thing without screaming.

1936608898|5.0|Full Disclosure: I know Dallas and Melissa (D&M henceforth). I've eaten dinner with them, ranted with them, laughed with them, and shared stories with them about working with people to help improve their health and well-being. That does not dilute any of what I'm about to type.<br /><br />D&M are highly sought after by health and fitness practitioners to teach everything they're laying out in the book. You might find yourself reading \\"It Starts With Food\\" (ISWF henceforth) and thinking it sounds too polished, the authors just a little too perfect...but you'd be mistaken. D&M are just as passionate in real life as they are in the written word.<br /><br />They ooze care, they really want to help educate you so that you can take control of your own health and well-being destiny. I've seen Melissa cry at the thought of transformations made by people they've worked with over the years through their Whole 30 program...they really mean everything they say in the book. You'll laugh at the funny bits, be intrigued by the science, and perhaps take a bit of ego-driven umbrage to their (loving) browbeating but the fact remains: they want you to succeed and want to teach you how through any means necessary.<br /><br />But you've got to take the first step. Buy the book, review the material, take the Whole 30 challenge, and be surprised at not only how much better you feel, how much sexier you look, and how much clearer you think but how, in hindsight, it really comes down to the original medicine: food. It truly starts with food.

1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa have done a great job with this book.  I have a library, an entire wall of books-- nutrition books, diet books, exercise and human performance books--and I frequently make recommendations for my family, friends, and patients concerning exercise, treatment options and nutrition. (I am an Orthopedic surgeon who specializes in Spinal Surgery).<br />\\"It Starts with Food\\" has earned a place on my recommendation list.<br />Dallas and Melissa have written a very readable book, with well thought out and well studied recommendations.<br />This is a book for everyone. It is not just a diet book.  It is a book describing a healthy way of eating for Life.<br />My recommendation:  Read this book, then implement its ideas.  Eat this way. It is a healthy way to eat, for even more reasons than they go into in this book. Then go on and pursue your dreams.  You will have a good nutritional foundation from which to grow.

B0078ZYXSA|5.0|So it turns out that Homer Simpson was right when he predicted in a classic episode of that great show \\"you haven't heard the last of Dexys Midnight Runners\\". True its taken some 27 years for the band to return with this album and much water has passed under the bridge with the controversy of Kevin Rowland's solo output, a short reunion tour in 2003 and a growing feeling that this new record which Rowland kind of promised in 2005 would never materialize. But here it is and it's wonderful. Let us pause at this point for a small detour since some critics are stating its Dexys best record ever. This is questionable since \\"Don't stand me down\\" remains one of the most precious bits of vinyl in many a discerning record collection and while \\"One day I'm going to soar\\" is a splendid record it contains nothing in its grooves like the incredible majesty of \\"This is what she's like\\". Nevertheless after this hiatus all sensible predictors could not have anticipated an album quite so rounded, thoughtful, cathartic and packed with great songs. The 58 year old Kevin Rowland remains one of the most potent and original forces in British music and while that voice might not be quite as soaring as it once was it has grown with stature and learned maturity into a truly brilliant instrument.<br /><br />All shades of the human experience are to be found in the grooves of this record not least ageing, love, dejection and rejuvenation. On the lead single \\"She got a wiggle\\" we see a silly title hide one of the most gorgeous Al Green inspired songs that Rowland has penned. It's all dark and burning with passionate intensity. On the opener \\"Now\\" you have six minutes of brassy power commencing with a slow start and Rowland reflecting on college days until it kicks into a classic Dexys signature song, which harks back to \\"Soul Rebels\\". It is obvious from the outset that the band is tighter than an ill fitting pair of jeans and with Rowland's backed by Pete Williams and Big Jim Paterson from the original line-up and the addition of the Style Council's Mick Talbot and the sterling new female vocalist Madeline Hyland its hardly surprising, The second song is \\"Lost\\" and its a classic with Rowland singing better than ever and not afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve as he regrets how his soul was \\"lost inside\\" pointing at the deep pain of his darker years. \\"One day I'm going to soar\\" is a very soulful record and the lounge lizard almost jazzy \\"Me\\" epitomizes a new level of relaxed depth with a tell tale spoken passage in the middle of a song which demands repeated plays as Rowland confesses that \\"all these people are depending on me... I don't know who's friend or foe\\". It is followed by the excellent \\"You\\" that rolls along like an old Stones classic and would require your feet nailed to your floorboards to stop them tapping. The big centre point of the album is the seven minute plus \\"I'm thinking of you\\" which just about stays on the right side of being repetitive and is lifted by a nice saxophone solo five minutes in. In terms of \\"I'm always going to love you\\" it musically starts like an old Philly sound record until Rowland trades sweet nothings (which all end in tears) with Hyland in a song which has a one take in the studio ambiance. \\"Free\\" was performed with gusto on Jools Holland the other week in a great live performance and comes over on record with even more power and punch, but even better is \\"Incapable of love\\" where Rowland exchanges verbal punches with Hyland over his lack of commitment to a relationship. Finally \\"Its Ok John Joe\\" is pure Rowland with a lonely piano playing over a long spoken introduction where he confesses, \\"I'm only learning to operate in this this world\\". It rolls out slowly but surely over its eight minutes and sees Rowland quote Marvin Gaye and indulge in a therapeutic if questioning lament on the pitfalls of lost love.<br /><br />Its difficult to describe in words the unadulterated joy that this splendid return after sucha time brings to this reviewer. Rowland is a performer we should treasure and speak of in hushed tones. He has certainly dropped howlers aplenty and blurred the fine line between genius and fool. That however is the price you pay for a talent that refuses to lie down. Indeed you strain to think of any bands that dare to bare their souls and inject such heart into their music as Dexys. After listening to this scintillating album you can guarantee that for a time everything thing else will sound devoid of passion and guts.a time brings to this reviewer.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|A rich, interesting, strong, and riveting album, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" has been approaching for a long time now, with its first two songs appearing many months ago, and the crazy-good \\"Headlong Flight\\" popping up as the true first single. There's so much here, I'm grateful for some early exposure. It was a great and welcome marketing move.<br /><br />The songs are all great, from the complex to the downright old school; it's a great blend. Geddy sounds great in voice and bass; Alex is flourishing a wicked guitar with taste and class; and Neil does everything right, with inventive driving rhythms and decorative percussion mixed in everywhere.<br /><br />What a great album!

1936608898|5.0|I met Dallas and Melissa at one of their Whole9 nutrition seminars a while back. Since that time, I've been hopeful that they would write a book to detail the life changing concepts they taught in the presentation.<br /><br />As soon as the book was available, I got a copy and read it cover to cover. The book is very well written and entertaining, and despite my familiarity with some of their concepts, the book introduced me to new ideas and further increased my confidence to follow this nutritional pathway for health.<br /><br />The fundamentals of their message make sense immediately, nothing gimmicky. I found the scientific explanations to be very interesting, which also served to strengthen my belief that these intuitive concepts are valid.<br /><br />From all the various nutrition and health books that I have read, when it came down to brass tax, I recently recommend this book to a family member looking for guidance. I think that say a lot.

1451608659|4.0|As I write this, the summer Olympics are just around the corner. So it is an ideal time for this memoir to appear. Dominque Moceanu remains the youngest American gymnast to win an Olympic gold medal. Of Romanian heritage, she was raised in what she describes as a harsh environment with cultural traditions that set her apart. She also had a very strict father prone to rages, a domineering coach, and a strange childhood.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Moceanu decided to open her book with a chapter titled, \\"Sisters\\", a section focusing on the discovery of a sister she'd never known before and one who was given up for adoption by Moceanu's parents. She does introduce the chapter by listing the highlights of her life - winning an Olympic gold medal, a court battle against her parents, etc. Still, the discovery of her sister is an intriguing and somewhat baffling choice for the start of the book. Instead, the saga of meeting her sister - and their continued connection-  could well have made a fascinating book by itself.<br /><br />It isn't until the second chapter that Moceanu describes her background and roots - her parent's courtship and marriage and Moceanu's birth (which is only noted at the end of the chapter).<br /><br />And then...finally...the book focuses on Moceanu.  Quite logically, she begins with her childhood. She felt very different, an outsider. Because of her parent's traditions, the food, clothing, and customs at home were unlike her peers. She took solace in gymnastics and was fortunate enough to excel at the sport.<br /><br />When she was accepted by the Karolyis, she found Bela Karolyi to be a tyrant who was all too eager to tell Moceanu's father about any mistakes, however small, in the gym. Memories of a turbulent life are mixed in with chapters focusing on Dominique's sister. I found this to be somewhat confusing and out of sequence..<br /><br />But Off Balance still held my attention. Although gymnastic routines may be beautiful, the brutal world in the gym, the long hours, and working through extreme pain add perspective to life behind the beauty. Most of Off Balance is grim but at moments there are flashes of joy. This is Moceanu's truth and while readers may hope for a different view the life described seems honest and real.<br /><br />I have no idea if the facts are accurate when it comes to gymnastic training. But her resilience and courage, hard won, is inspiring. I've left out many details because I don't want to spoil some surprises, especially one about Moceanu's sister. There is also a deeper look at Moceanu's home life, her experience with Karolyi, and participation in the Olympics. I'm deducting one star because of the uneven pace and chronology.the gym, the long hours, and working through extreme pain add perspective to life behind the beauty.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|If you are like me, and a great read means literally and figurativley getting lost in the story, then The Name of the Wind should be your next purchase. Not only did I lose myself in the characters, but also in the adventure, the landscape, the traditions, and the acedmic nature of it all. The story within a story is an inticing aspect for most readers, but this book goes even deeper, often telling other stories within the the second layer. This story is masterfully written and, as a person with a broad imagination and little patience for anything with too much of an air of childish fantasy, this story pulled me in in a few minutes and kept me from the tv or my video games for over a week. I couldn't help but fill any and all of my free time to bring myself back into the story. I bought the second book immediately after finishing this one and I cannot give this series high enough praise as an avid reader. Patrick Rothfuss, PLEASE FINISH BOOK 3!!!

1400156653|1.0|The accent of the narrator is really irritating. What's more is that he does not even sound Indian as pronounces places in India like he has heard it for the first time.

1400069289|5.0|The entire book leads up to the Appendix, which contains the portion of the book where the reader starts to change his/her own habits. You could argue that the appendix alone would make a great magazine article: \\"Use this hot tip to transform your life!\\"<br /><br />But you need all the background to understand the way habits work. You need all the extra evidence so that you'll trust the behavior modification strategy. There are extensive notes at the end of the book which refer back to original sources.<br /><br />Now that I have read the book, I will refer again and again to the Appendix, because that's the core of it all. In the past few days since finishing the book, I made a few small changes to my daily habits. I plan to tackle bigger and bigger changes as time goes on. I expect to get better with practice.<br /><br />Why put forth constant effort to maintain brute force willpower when you can step back to examine the tiny impulses that drive your desires and behaviors? Great book!

Audrey Tautou is perfect as Amelie...  besides being adorable, her facial expressions do much to add to the feel of her character and the comical quirkiness of the movie.  It is a celebration of mysteries and little miracles within the magical essence of Paris, with scenes of extremely unique and charming cinematography.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed watching the additional disc with Audrey's screen test and cast interviews.

B000E1YVZU|1.0|I LOVED the stage version with the original cast - I saw the play in 1996.  AMAZING.  Most of the actors were not Broadway performers, which added a sense of realism and urgency to the roles.  However, this filmed version is so bland and boring it's barely watchable.  My biggest complaint is the direction - the staged version had energy and sass - the film drags along until you can't wait for it to be over.  I wish there was a filmed version of the original cast circa 1996.  Avoid this movie.

BORING!<br /><br />I don't see any real sexual tension between the characters, and I still don't understand the attraction from Christian to Ana. CONFUSING!<br /><br />The use of UK phrases is just out of place. The overuse of phrases like \\"crap,double crap,inner goddess,down there and lip biting\\" is awful.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|The new Rush album for me is a let down, it doesn't rock, it's concept is hard to play along with and the production sounds muddy. The first third of the album uses bad sounding special effect noises, the middle third is ok and the last third of the album is a waste of time. In the year 2012 I expected more, production techniques now days apparently have passed Rush by, that's to bad, I can tell they put some work and effort into the tracks but they just don't really pay off. Nothing on this new record is a special song, rocks hard or makes you go wow. There are of course some moments of clarity and that's when Rush sounds the best on this album, I think these guys are capable of a lot more and perhaps this release is just getting them in the mood again to release a real corker in the near future, please guys write some hard rock tunes and give it the crystal clear production that your songs deserve, this one was a ground rule double maybe the next one will be a home run, here's hoping.

She never needed anything else. Or so she thinks until Dex calls off their dream wedding and she uncovers the ultimate betrayal. Blaming everyone but herself, Darcy flees to London and attempts to re-create her glamorous life on a new continent. But to her dismay, she discovers that her tried-and-true tricks no longer apply--and that her luck has finally expired. It is only then that she can begin her journey toward redemption, forgiveness, and true love.<br /><br />After reading Something Borrowed quite awhile ago, I finally got around to reading the next in the series.  This book focuses on Darcy who is pregnant and left at the altar by her fiance', Dex.  Thinking she can start her life over she flees to Londan and stays with her friend Ethan.  Darcy starts learning that she has been quite self-centered and childish with the help of Ethan and finally manages to learn about her own faults and correct them, mainly focusing on her growing baby.<br /><br />The writing is good and it is a fun read.  This is my kind of go to book when I want a nice fun read.  4 stars!

0743298039|5.0|I am reading the Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield, and I am completely hooked, while I am also very encouraged by how much writing advice I am finding within its pages. The book's plot circles around two authors and devoted readers who are setting out on a quest to tell the never before shared tales of their past. One of them has willingly sought out this fate, while the other is uncovering this result as the book progresses. Neither of them wants to open up to truth's transparency, but both desperately need it to be free of the ghosts of their past.    As writers and authors, they usually avoid the task at hand by talking about writing itself. Vida Winter, one of the two authors, said some very interesting things last night when I was reading that I just had to share. First she said, \\"All stories have a beginning, middle, and end. It's their order that's important.\\" As a writer, I find this to be a very vexing part of constructing a story. What to tell when, how to tell it, and who to say it with is a constant uphill battle. But, it is the challenge that turns the tide of the war. Once accomplished, the order of a story, its characters, and its voices all come together to become art, perfect within their imperfection.    As both of these characters struggle to disclose their past, I can totally relate to them. By telling the story of themselves, it is like they are giving away the secret of their art. In response to this phenomenon, Vida Winter rambled on, \\"Life is compost.\\" She explained her meaning saying that all the events of life, its relationships, events, memories, dreams, etc. all pile and decompose together into the potting soil of the stuff stories grow from. Telling the tale of your own life is like draining the supply of one's creative matter to work with. Still, the beauty of this statement is the wonderful depiction of one's life with the art that comes from it.    Personally, I enjoy writing memoir, and find it rather freeing, but even so I nevertell the full tale. I keep most of it to myself so that it's still mine to work with. Otherwise, it becomes like a ship setting sail to be lost at sea. It is jettisoned from my repertoire of sources to pull from. The tale has been told and can no longer be used as fuel for another. Hence, I prefer to write fictional stories with aspects of my life, but without its full truth.    So, what are your thoughts on these lessons from Vida Winter? Do you believe life is compost? Is your life's story the fuel of your writing? Mine is, and I guard it as such. My life has a beginning, a middle, and an end. I am still arranging its tale. It won't be told until I've finished.

What would you do?\\"<br /><br />Linh Cinder lives in the Eastern Commonwealth, with her stepmother, Adri, and her stepsisters, Peony and Pearl. Cinder is a mechanic, and it is when she is at the market that she first meets Prince Kai. He has come to ask her to repair his android. She agrees. And thus begins a whirlwind ride, intertwining a dystopian future involving cyborgs and Lunars and a dash of Cinderella.<br /><br />I've heard some mixed things about \\"Cinder\\", which is what has kept me from reading it for so long. After the disappointment of [[ASIN:0062024043 Insurgent]], I figured nothing could be quite so disappointing (and boring), so I started reading \\"Cinder\\". And, by golly, I really liked it. Sure, it's got its problems, but I think it shows real potential and is very creative and vivid--and pretty darned exciting!<br /><br />In my criteria of what makes a good book, a well-written character is near the top. And Cinder is a pretty well-written character. I love how she's a mechanic, sorta nerdy, but also not opposed to the girlie side of things. So yeah, I saw a lot of me in her. She was a smart protagonist, quick-thinking, compassionate, strong, and all around likable. I loved her relationship to Iko, the robot, and her relationship to Peony. Cinder was a character I could root for, a character I wanted to succeed.<br /><br />Of course, she wasn't perfect. There is a BIG SECRET about her that you can guess only 50 pages into the book, yet Cinder doesn't find out until the last 10 pages. Also, I had quite a time trying to imagine what she looked like. She came from Europe at one point but lives in New Beijing. So is she Caucasian or Asian? No, it's not a deal-breaking thing, but I do like to have an image of the character as I progress through a book (series). In the end, I pictured her as Kaylee from Firefly.<br /><br />The other characters were amazing. Prince Kai was definitely not your stereotypical Love Interest. He had concerns and desires apart from wanting to be with Cinder. He took his responsibilities seriously. And, let's face it, how he meets and falls in love with Cinder was probably one of the sweetest romances I've read in recent times.<br /><br />I really appreciated how Meyer wrote the stepmother and stepsisters. It would have been easy to make them over-the-top evil, but she didn't. Adri felt like a woman, burdened with this girl her now-deceased husband adopted. Sure, that doesn't make what she did any better, but I did feel some empathy to her. Same with Pearl. Peony was absolutely great; she was Cinder's confidant, a sweet, hopeful girl.<br /><br />Even our villain was pretty intimidating. A lot of YA villains tend to be all EVULZ, and while Queen Levana was no joke, she at least had the backbone and gumption to BE that all EVULZ woman. I felt she was a real threat, not some wishy-washy villain that the heroine will easily unseat.<br /><br />The story was enthralling. I was completely absorbed through the entire thing. There weren't any dull moments, moments where nothing is happening with the story. Sure, I felt that the story may have relied too much on the Cinderella element--I think Meyer had a strong enough idea, she didn't need the fairy tale element to make it work. But I still enjoyed every moment.<br /><br />And the dystopia element actually worked. A lot of YA dystopias fail at this point. [[ASIN:0062085484 Shatter Me]] tells you the world is horrible by saying things like \\"there isn't any food\\" or \\"people aren't allowed to read\\". Insurgent is based upon an idea that falls apart when you look too closely at it. To me, \\"Cinder\\" felt like a fairly plausible dystopian-ish future. New technology, new governments, new ways of life. About the only thing that made me skeptical was the Lunar aspect. How did they evolve their bioeletrical abilities? Does it have to do with living on a moon with 1/6 gravity? (Of course, this line of thought brings MANY things about the Lunars into question, so it's probably best that the science geek of me leaves that alone.)<br /><br />In many ways, this was the book I had hoped \\"Insurgent\\" would be: a fun, adventurous book about a strong, confidant woman doing the right thing even when she may be the only one fighting for a better life. When I hit the final page, I wanted to immediately reach out and grab Book 2. Hopefully, Meyer will write quickly so I can find out what happens next!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

0545265355|3.0|I am reading the Hunger Games Trilogy right now. Honestly, it is an awesome idea, world, and plot implemented in a really creative way. There are many conflicts, both interpersonal and societal that are addressed within each of the books. Suzanne Collins seems to be the master of ending with a cliff hanger as well. Seriously, nothing ever comes to an end without stopping short of beginning something else. Her dialog between characters is realistic and even humorous at times, which I appreciate as something few can manage as easily. She masterfully conceals things from the reader by immersing us within the narrating character. We know something beyond our perspective is going on, but we are just as in the dark as the main character is.    Still, there is one thing that I can't help but complain about here. Though the Hunger Games Trilogy is a unique \\"most read,\\" I really think ti should have been shorter. It seems to have fallen into the genre's need for a trilogy. I get it, things are better in threes, especially financially, but this series really could have been told in less words after the first book. Another thing that goes hand in hand with this is the reiteration of the main character's internal voice. Not only do we hear Katniss Everdeen \\"thinking it,\\" but then we hear her \\"saying it\\" in the next scene either verbally or mentally. A lot less time could be dedicated to hashing and then rehashing out what the reader should already be given credit to understand on their own. It's almost insulting!    Without all this thinking and re-saying and mental somersaulting through what the reader has already come to admittedly understand, the series could have easily been told in one, longer book. I know. It isn't what any normal publish company would ever say, but, as a reader and someone who desperately wants to maintain the quality of modern writing, I would say books these days need to be shorter and denser with a whole lot less words and more room for the reader toimply and deduct rather than being told EVERYTHING. More showing, less telling. More reader, less writer beating the reader over the head with the story.    This goes for a lot of modern writing of late, especially within the fantasy/sci-fi genre. Yes, it's great to have a lot of a good story to read to make it last longer, but in the end it kills it. What ever happened to short and sweet? Too much of a good thing is bad. What are your thoughts?    For more, visit: [...]
0515149489|3.0|I recently read The Witness and loved it very much. I was wanting to find another NR suspense book and got this one (audio book version). I have no problem with the narrator (I'm usually finicky about that) and the characters are charming. I even fell in love with those dogs, but there was no suspense except at the very end. I was hoping for more action and suspense through the book. No, I'm not asking for constant action or a Jason Bourne novel, but with what the book is about, I expected more. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This movie is more of the same stale generic sci-fi garbage we've been seeing for years. It brings nothing new to the table. It raises a million questions but answers none of them. It makes absolutely no sense at all & it's just a bunch of scenes put together that don't go anywhere. The creatures are really retarded looking & just appear with no rhyme or reason. And it has nothing to do with the Alien franchise. The only reason it's getting good reviews is because they stuck the Space Jockey from ALIEN in it to trick Alien fans into thinking it has something to do with Alien. So they're all giving it good reviews because they want the Alien franchise to continue & they feel some kind of strange loyalty to Ridley Scott. I've seen better direct to video releases. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage, just wait for the DVD or Netflix.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|If they gave 1/2 stars I would give this 3.5.  This is a fun, easy read.  I was able to read this in a couple of days.  Very interesting perspective, but very unlikeable characters.  The only one remotely likeable was the cop.
0307592731|3.0|I alternated between being mesmerized and incredibly annoyed while reading this book. I listened to the audio version, which was wonderfully narrated by Bernadette Dunne. On the plus side I walked about 30 miles while listening. If your idea of camping is a motel room with the windows open, you might find this a more fascinating read. If you are outdoors person, not so much. I give it 2.5 stars which rounds up to 3.

B004QL7K6G|2.0|George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are a pretentious NY couple. When their jobs go south, so do they, to live with Paul's uncouth brother (Ken Marino) in Atlanta. Unable to live with him, they opt to go live in a hippy commune. As it turns out the members are not as likable as George originally thought and one has designs on his wife.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the film to become funny and break out of its predictable mold. It never did. Perhaps the funniest thing was Aniston ranting about Penguins being killed by global warming and living with the seals and polar bears in the Arctic. I didn't know if it was intended to show Aniston's character was stupid or the writer of the script was stupid. Penguins don't live in the Arctic. And since no one at HBO caught the goof while watching her film, I bet it was a stupid mistake made by writers who are not smarter than a fifth grader.<br /><br />I was bored for most of the film.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex talk, full frontal nudity (male/female). No sex scenes.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|I loved and hated this book. The content is great although I was becoming a little frustrated by more of the good guys falling. Was pleased to see at least one of the bad ones topple.... at last! Loved it overall though, and I'm now ready to tear into the next one!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I enjoy this ministry and greatly appreciate each movie made thus far.  Each film is better than the previous in every aspect.  Ever improving film quality, writing, acting, etc.<br /><br />This film is a much needed call to fatherhood...and a call to family as well, which is needed just as much.  Families are the building blocks of society.  With so many broken families we have many problems in society.  I love how the film reminds us that fathers are called to lead their families and be their true heads.<br /><br />I also especially love how this film, even if it was not intentional, kind of modeled the Love and Respect I've been learning from Dr. Emmerson and Sara Eggerich's ministry when the characters chose to rely on God's word (rather than their personal whims or the whims of popular culture).  I mean, men need to be the men they were created to be, and they NEED to be respected.  They were made with the desire to serve, provide, protect, etc.  It's true that media and pop culture's over emphasis on love and the feminine view of relationships with neglect and even condemnation of men's need to be respected have been damaging.  Not only does this movie enourage men to be fathers, it encourages men to be men and to be respected as such!  Yes, I am a woman and I am happy to give (unconditional) honor and respect!  When involved parties are truly well-intentioned and willing to yield to God's laws of relationships, it really does foster a loving, respectful relationship.  This in turn affects family as a whole, which, when done on a massive scale will spill over into society level by level, from homes to neighborhoods to communities, etc.  (BTW it is God's laws of physics that keep our physical universe stable and predictable...if we would use our freedom of choice to yield to His relational laws for society, couldn't have stability there as well...food for thought)<br /><br />Great film and great message: Be strong and courageous!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is sizzling.  Not for the sexually squeamish. I'm sure some would think this was downright pornographic and I guess it is.  The sex leaves nothing to the imagination.  It held my attention for the day and a half it took me to read it. Already read the other two books in the trilogy.  The writer is not what I'd call fantastic but she sure gets her point across.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a nice game.nice time killer. I don't liienhow one set of animals disappeared other than that its a very cool app
B000VSAEYI|5.0|First of all, I love it.  Secondly, I love it!!!!  I love that it doesn't keep a lot of water in it because I have a 22 month old, so I can keep an eye on her even from a bit of a distance without having her slipping and knocked down by deeper water.  I love that it can have sprinklers or not depending on your mood.  I like that it is pretty roomy and comes with little floaty toys.  We had five 2-4 years olds hopping in and out at the same time without problems.  I love the slide.  It is a little challenging to climb up for the 22 month old because she is small for her age, but she manages just fine and she has a blast with it.  Just make sure that there is enough water on it.  I was prepared to grease it up a little with sunscreen because a reviewer said that it wasn't slippery, but it has been fine for us.  We also use our Little Tykes toddler slide so that it empties into the pool and that kind of spits the kids out faster than the blow up slide on the pool.  Even the 8-12 year olds were playing in the pool and loved it.  The 9 year old uses the slide to bounce off of and it has withstood her gymnastics very nicely.  There are 7 little individual sections to blow up and then the main part.  This is super fast for us because we have an air compressor, but the little parts are time consuming to empty because there isn't a separate release hole for them.  We have sprouted a couple of holes around the perimeter, but it is because someone drug a toy into the pool that snagged on it.  The holes have been easily mended with the patch included.  Awesome little pool for a GREAT price!
0345803485|1.0|Most overly dramatic train wreck since Twilight. The author threw in some \\"big words\\" just to make her sound like a more accomplished writer, then proceeded to use only those same few \\"big words\\" for the ENTIRE SERIES. Writers are supposed to be creative, and at least know how to use a damn thesaurus. Jesus. The sex scenes were ridiculous and unbelievable, to say the least, not to mention redundant. Very redundant. As in had to put it down because I got bored in the middle of one, and also started skipping through parts to get the suffering over with. Also, the main character's life is just beyond believable. This isn't in the fantasy genre, so I would have assumed it would be mildly realistic. Yeah, no. Nothing about it is believable. The main character really just needs smacked across the face good to realize she is a needy, simpering, pathetic excuse for a female with a psychologically abusive man, not some poor, hurt, fifty shades of whatever \\"little copper haired boy.\\"<br /><br />***Final words: redundant. Ridiculously redundant***
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan for over 3 decades. I've always been a fan of \\"conceptual\\" albums.<br />This satisfies on so many levels...and it grows on you - the more you listen, the more you hear things you might not have the first time through.<br /><br />Kudos to the guys for an outstanding achievement. There is so much going on here musically and it all combines for a beautiful work of art. Several songs satisfy the rocker in me and several satisfy the poet in me. You'll find it all here.. blazing rifs (touches of past albums), harmonizing vocals, soft strings, and lyrics that tell a wonderful story, wrapping it all into a super satifying package.<br /><br />Geddy, Alex and Neil really outdid themselves this time. In my opinion, their best achievement in years. Read the liner notes between the song lyrics. They add to the story and enhance the experience.<br />A separate round of applause for the producer. The cave man did it again.<br /><br />Can't wait to see them live (again).<br />Enjoy!
B00005NTN5|5.0|BOUND is in a class of its own. No other movie with lesbian protagonists even comes close.<br />There's a real story and it's NOT about Tilly and Gershon being lesbians and expressing their<br />lesbianism and finding who they are sexually and all that crap, although they are definitely portraying<br />lesbian characters. The mob scenario is riveting and the heroic ending for the two women is magnificent.<br />SEE THIS FILM. Thank you Wachowski's, for a great movie movie.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun! Watching ads/promos was easy<br />way to collect coins, however,  I upgraded to the paid version. Still gave this 5 stars, though!<br />I did notice for the kindle fire, both downloads had the same name on the icons, so when it was time to delete the free version, (as suggested by developer) it was confusing. Overall; a lot of bang for your buck...except in this case, \\"no buck\\"!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have a Kindle and the Kindle app on two devices.  The devices with the app always sync to the Kindle, but never the other direction or to each other.  In other words, if I am at the furthest page read on the Kindle, the other devices will sync to that; if I am at the furthest page on my cell phone, for example, neither the Kindle nor the tablet will find that.  I spoke with someone at Amazon about this problem and their answer to always manually sync the apps after reading rarely works.  I don't know what the fix needs to be, but it would be great if this would work.  If it weren't for this problem, I would give 5 stars.

B000063DI9|5.0|If the guitars were any louder than they already are, the album would be drowned in Guitars (as far as Maiden goes this may not be a bad thing). The synths on this album add tremendously to their sound! They didn't drown their music in synths, they didn't trade guitar mastery for the ability to play with synths, they just added a new layer into their music and the result- it was much needed. The music here is just as heavy as ever. Dave and Adrian pull off some great solos and leads throughout this album. They are great and you can hear them just fine! Steve is his usual self with his superb bass skills. Nikko is on top of his game here. The drum parts on these some of these songs are very interesting. The main star for this album imho, is Bruce! He decided to sing in a raw voice style and I personally think that this factor added even more to an already great album! I can't say that I'm a Maiden expert. I've heard all of this album and \\"Brave New World\\" and I've heard many songs from their classic albums. But from the classic songs I've heard, I can't see why people are saying the guitars are too low in the mix or anything...maybe it is because mine is the 2002 remaster.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. \\"Moonchild\\"- I'll admit, it took a while for this one to grow on me. I always liked the opening on the acoustic and then the synth part but the actual song after that took a while to grow on me. Now that it's grown on me, I can say this is one of Maiden's heaviest songs and best as well. The synths add a great deal to the intro of the song and then the song itself after the synth intro is FILLED with amazing guitar work and just amazes me! Bruce's voice is a POWERHOUSE!!! His voice is so powerful on this song! I love it so much! Great, great song!<br /><br />2. \\"Infinite Dreams\\"- A nice progressive little tune. I like how it's softer in the verses and gets power in the chorus and has a faster section with the solos and fun stuff. The song is just overall great. I love listening to this song's melodies and it's just a very unique song. I like that Maiden is experimenting with things.<br /><br />3. \\"Can I Play With Madness\\"- Oh boy! This song is catchy! The guitar parts during the verses are pure awesomeness! Drumming on this one: Love it! This may be commercial, but hey! At least they didn't do a hairmetal song or something stupid like that! The synths are utilized during the chorus and just add a great tone to it. This song is just one of my all-time fave Maiden songs. Once again, Bruce is killing on vocals! He just has a great sound here and sounds very inspired!<br /><br />4. \\"The Evil That Men Do\\"- This song is good! Bruce's voice in the verses is sinister and it sounds cool! Then in the pre-chorus ans chorus he goes up higher and gives us that signature high voice he's known for. This song is very catchy as well. I like the guitar work throughout this song and the high vocal harmonies are always awesome!<br /><br />5. \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\"- This is great! I love the intro to it! The song itself is awesome of progressive! Some people who bash this album just don't like progressive stuff; I get that. I mean lots of progessive stuff is over 5 minutes. I personally love that, but obviously it's not for everyone. This song is great, but I would've liked to have more vocals towards the end. I don't like how after like 3 or 4 minutes of a song, they drag it out with long guitar solos. The soft drum interlude in the middle is pretty cool and the chorus/synth work is pretty cool. But if I wanted to hear 3 minute long guitar solos, I would've gone to a DragonForce album. Don't get me wrong; this song is fantastic, I just wish they would've had more vocals in it towards the end.<br /><br />6. \\"The Prophecy\\"- This song is interesting. It's in a triplet feel and it took a while to grow on me too, but I like this one a lot as well. It has progressiveness to it and the intro is just awesome! I like how it starts off as a guitar/synth thing and then the electric guitar duo just comes out of nowhere and blasts you out of your thoughts! I like this one's verses are amazing as well. Bruce has some more sinister voices here. There's also some pretty tasty guitar work goin on in this song as well!<br /><br />7. \\"The Clairvoyant\\"- This song is amazing! Love the guitar part that comes in right after Steve Harris' bass solo intro. There's GREAT guitar work and tone on this song! With the exception of the speed factor, the tones here sound like something DragonForce might do so I think these guys influenced DragonForce (I like DragonForce, but they are not nearly as great as the Irons and some of the other bands I like). But anyway this song is one of the best songs here (actually if asked my fave on this album, I don't think I could choose. I like all of them! Except \\"Only the Good Die Young). The verses of this song are heavy and the pre-chorus has soaring guitar melodies and then the chorus is heavy and sounds like a time signature change or something. It goes together very well, but you can tell there was a change from the pre-chorus to the chorus. Another great one!<br /><br />8. \\"Only the Good Die Young\\"- I personally don't like this one. I don't know what it is about this one, but I just don't like this one. I mean it has all the things that makes the rest of the songs great but this one just comes off as a little bland compared to the rest of them. It's not bad, but I just don't care about it.<br /><br />Verdict: Is it a great album? YES! Is it Maiden's best? To be fair, I've only heard this one and \\"[[ASIN:B00004TH7Z Brave New World]]\\" all the way through and I love both equally. I love the power and progressiveness that both show very prominently. I recommend both of these albums. If you are not a fan of progressive music, this could be either the album that gets you into progressive music or maybe not. If you like Dream Theater and Symphony X, this isn't as progressive, but it's still a great listen like any of their other albums. Up the Irons!ar/synth thing and then the electric guitar duo just comes out of nowhere and blasts you out of your thoughts! I like this one's verses are amazing as well. Bruce has some more sinister voices here. There's also some pretty tasty guitar work goin on in this song as well!<br /><br />7. \\"The Clairvoyant\\"- This song is amazing!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just picked up this book yesterday and as of midnight last night, I've finished 250 pages of Fifty Shades of Grey and if it's poorly written I'll be a monkey's uncle! The last book I read that captured my attention this quick and held it like this was Red River Prosecutor by Judge Kevin Bacon. Granted there are some grammatical errors in Grey but the publisher is at fault for that. Also, I've noticed that it grasps my attention so well, that I overlook the errors while reading cause you succumb to the author's details and boy, the imagination kicks in big time!  The details by E. L. James are so vivid, I feel like a fly on the wall watching as the book unfolds.
B000OVPTAG|3.0|To put all doubts aside, the \\"Mists\\" was undeniably written mainly for a female audience.  Firstly, a pregnant woman told me it was \\"really good.\\"  Not only are the main characters women, but much of the content is feminine, and some of it very purple indeed.  Marriage, husbands, pregnancy, birth, babies, parenting, family relationships, all kinds of romance, thoughts about personal appearance, and personal animosities.  There all also some fantasy elements of a kind more particular to women.  Morguase snagging every young man who comes her way and still looking very good at fifty.  Gwenhwyfar turning, just for her, the here - apparently homosexual - Lancelet.  Also, this was somewhat subtle, but seemingly a bisexual ménage à trois with Gwen/Lance/Arthur.  Another new element some may find objectionable is the topic of abortion.<br /><br />Despite being a man, I did like some elements of this book.  Some of Bradley's writing -- about mortality, about the changing times, about the struggle to do the right thing, about love -- encourages a level of self-contemplation.  And I think it is always good to try to gain some insight into the female mind.<br /><br />Though some of MZB's changes are interesting, I think some are for the worst.  Blood relationships formed an important part of medievalism, and the family element is engaging at times.  But I feel she expands blood to the detriment of the original story.  What is the point of the round table, if Arthur is cousin to half his knights and they cousin to the other half?  What is the dream of Camelot, if it was all nepotism (including Merlin)?  Also, I think the incest plot rings falsely as, in the story,  Britain was a land of many kings and subkings, as opposed to lands like ancient Egypt or the Inca Empire with their god-kings.  Also, I thought Pendragon wasn't really from a long line of high-kings.<br /><br />Again, I think the paganism is an interesting element, but it is expanded to the detriment of Christianity.  There isn't really any sympathetic Christian character until Gwenhwyfar undergoes a change, at the very end of the story.  There also seems to be a lot of plot holes in the pagan subplot, vis-à-vis prophecies, the sight, and Morgause.<br /><br />Finally, the book is too long.  Parts of it seem as nearly sluggish or repetitive as Mallory's jousting lists.  At least 200 pages should have been trimmed, especially seeing how epic battles are summed up in about a page.

1936608898|5.0|First I'd like to comment in regards to the reviewer being skeptical about all the glowing reviews. There were quite a few advance copies made. This is standard procedure in the book industry to help create a buzz about the book - nothing shady here!<br /><br />Okay, now my review:<br /><br />ISWF is the perfect guide for anyone looking to make healthy changes in their life. I've been eating this way for sometime with great results and found Dallas & Melissas book insightful, informative and fun. In order to get the most out of this book you will need an open mind, a positive attitude and the ability to take action in your life.<br /><br />ISWF has all the nerdy science info for you logical types and all the practical how to guides for the \\"just-shut-up-and-tell-me-what-to-do\\" types. It is beautifully written, clear and concise with a pleasing layout.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend ISWF for anyone wanting to get well, get fit or just live well.

0823015033|5.0|This is the book to have on creating polymer clay figures. She has many tips that I wasn't aware of when I did these kinds of things 10 years ago. I decided to get back into it and bought this book to see what was new in this area of the craft. Her way of making the eyes is much better than I used to do, and there are all kinds of pictures on doing different things. I think anyone, no matter if you are a beginner or have been doing this awhile would find something useful in this book.
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|It's definitely a fun little flick, especially if you're a fan of Evans or Faris. Evans definitely steals the show, and I have a hard time believing that I would have even remotely enjoyed it had he not been in it.<br /><br />It's an extremely unrealistic movie though (though really, which romantic comedies are?), so you'll probably have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy it. I doubt much will stick with you after the movie's over either. I watched it about 3-ish weeks ago, and I'm struggling to remember the smaller beats of the flick.<br /><br />It's worth at least a rental.
B007C3TVEY|5.0|The cast of this movie is exceptional.  Ezra Miller is spellbinding.  A must see movie that touches the very core of a mother's worst nightmare.

1601251505|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />Im not going to say again all the great things that have already been said in the novel of reviews this product already has.<br /><br />I will say that unlike a lot of the reviews my pen and paper started with the last days of 3.o dungeons and dragons and most of it has been with 3.5 dungeons and dragons.  Also I will add my group has tried such great systems as Savage Worlds and Shadowrun and while they were nice as far as I am concerned for one reason or another all but good old standard d20 3.5 fell aside.<br /><br />From my perspective Pathfinder has well continued the 3.5 system and expanded it to the point all my players and myself have been very happy using the system and will all agree its the best we have used.<br /><br />I would like to add that class archtypes are the best highlight for me as to what they have done to give that extra customisation each of us was looking for.<br /><br />I agree with what an earlier reviewer said about not screaming back and forth about 4.o vs Pathfinder. For my group it was my group tried it and didnt like 4.o so pathfinder it was =P.<br /><br />I would recomend this product to anyone who came up with any version of d20 rules, hopefuly we will see a revision of d20 Modern soon **hint to Paizo**
0345803485|4.0|Very well written!  Not really what people who have not read, assume it is about.<br />It's sensual and erotic at times, but it is more of a deep love story, two people nurturing eachother through lots of laughs for the reader; it is a comedy as well.<br />A tad amount of S&M, but nothing that the reader cannot withstand.  I myself, am<br />in love with both characters.  I am at the mid-point through \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and it has added a romantic ingredient.  I'm thorougly enjoying.  E.L. is an amazing storyteller.  I have already ordered the final book to the trilogy.
1466401885|5.0|This is my first time reading a book by this author. I bought it because of the reviews and a recommendation from another author. Loved the story. Loved the emotion it evoked! I finished it after reading for two evenings. I would have finished it in a day if I stayed in. Pick it up and read it!

B004G5ZY7E|4.0|There have been a few books I picked up for my Kindle based on recommendations here - and this was one.  I almost burned my eyes out - and the book definitely got under my skin.  The author does a good job keeping the hair on the back of my neck up - and making sure I always had a light on when I read.  I already have other books by the author in my wish list - I wouldn't think twice about recommending this.
0307951529|5.0|I was very excited to read this book and it exceeded my expectations.  I love the combination of story and practical tips.  This isn't about creating a huge business it is about creating a business that creates value and freedom and can look and be different for everyone.  I marked it all up and have already used a lot of his ideas in my business.<br /><br />Love it and totally recommend it!  It is good if you are already in business as well as if you are just starting out.
B004WW88BK|5.0|It's a very comprehensive collection of Robert Johnson's songs. It includes alternate versions of some songs. I had no<br />trouble downloading it to iTunes. A very satisfying compilation at a reasonable price for two  discs of material. I<br />am a relative newcomer to most of Johnson's recordings, having heard the songs mainly in cover versions.
B003TH14H4|4.0|Before you choose instant video over DVDs, be aware that NONE of the extras are included!  You only get the actual episodes.<br /><br />That said, Amazon Unbox plays smoothly on my computer with no issues.  Amazon keeps a library for you, but you can also download the episodes to your hard-drive.<br /><br />For the actual content, I would have given 5 stars, as I love the series.  I just wish that the description had given full information on the missing content.  I would have ordered the DVDs instead.

B007URCTOG|4.0|Very touching story of a man who loses his wife in a car accident; not death, but lost to her memory.  She wakes up from a coma to remember only what happened before they had met.  It's a really sad struggle to see the two of them trying to make their marriage work; heart breaking at times when you see the flashbacks of what used to be and how disconnected they are at the present.  Almost made me shed a tear, but I was watching it with my Mother and Brother...so had to hold it back.  I bet when I watch it with my wife later we'll both be sobbing.  Great story that has a couple unexpected twists in it.

1936608898|5.0|I was thrilled when Melissa and Dallas asked me to review their new book, It Starts With Food.  Knowing their passion for nutrition as it relates to wellness, I expected nothing but the best...and I was more than impressed!  This is no ordinary \\"diet\\" book...it details the why and how to reset your health and nutrition using their Whole 30 program.  They have a knack for explaining very \\"science-y\\" facts in a way that ANYONE can understand.  They also have a knack for keeping you entertained!<br /><br />This is a MUST READ for anyone trying to better their lives!<br /><br />A couple of things I especially liked:<br /><br /> The discussion on the psychology of food cravings and how to differentiate between the two...even if you have been paleo for a while, we can always use a reset!  If you are new to Paleo, this book WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!.  This chapter is invaluable!<br />Their approach to eating and nutritionl is mainly focused on achieving optimal health...many \\"diets\\" promise rapid weight loss without even considering the health implications...this is not a diet book!

0307949486|4.0|Journalist Mikael Blomkvist has taken a personal and professional hit, one that comes with a three month jail sentence for libeling a financial mogul. As crooked as the untouchable giant is, Blomkvist's passion for justice was no match for the power of money. It was a harsh lesson to learn, and one that put his career and everything he holds dear on the line.<br /><br />Following his conviction and public embarrassment, Blomkvist receives an unexpected request from a man known for being one of Sweden's premiere industrialists. With that call comes an opportunity that will change the course of Blomkvist's life.<br /><br />Forty years ago, a young woman, niece of industry giant Henrik Vanger, disappeared from the mostly family-owned island where she was staying. Once a year every year since that fateful horror, her killer has taunted Henrik with memories of the beloved child, with his failure to protect her, with his failings as both a man and a corporate giant. Forty years Henrik has been haunted by inaction and cold leads. Now in his eighties, he wants answers, and in Blomkvist, he thinks he's found the tool necessary to dig for those answers, whatever they may be.<br /><br />As Blomkvist's and Vagner's lives start to intersect and a family dynasty suffers intense scrutiny, a young girl will be drawn into the hunt. Brilliant and cold, odd and passionless, Lisbeth Salander doesn't have friends so much as she has people she probably wouldn't kill. A savant at information gathering, it is her skill set more than her personality that appeals to Blomkvist. At first.<br /><br />The alliance they form and the attention they put towards a mystery that spans the last century will uncover a rotten core of pretty lies and powerful deceit. Together Blomkvist and the girl with the dragon tattoo will try to solve a case that has baffled police and criminalists for years so they can bring closure to a man in the twilight of his years. The race for the truth will become a cat and mouse game that will threaten their lives and rip apart their souls. Unfortunately, solving that extremely cold case is one thing. Living with the answers...that's quite another.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />I avoided this book for so long, and for fairly predictable reasons. So much hype, and most everyone talking about it like it was the best thing ever written. I know myself well enough to know that those types of books usually don't work for me the same way they seem to for everyone else.<br /><br />To a degree, that was exactly the case with Larsson's incredibly popular debut. I didn't think it was the most incredible book I'd ever read. I did, though, like it. Parts were absolutely awesome, thrilling, suspenseful, intriguing, and completely worthy of every ounce of praise it's received; some parts bored me to tears (like the first 200 pages or so). I wasn't crazy about Blomkvist, who I didn't much like as a man, but respected quite a lot as an investigator and a journalist. I loved Lisbeth Salander intensely.<br /><br />In fact, where the first two hundred or so pages struck me as rather emotionally flat and colorless, including character introductions, so much exposition I would have happily been struck blind as I was wading through it, and a mind-numbing expose on the financial climate in Sweden, every word of every scene with Lisbeth was vibrant...and slightly off-kilter...and excessively colorful. The girl is not normal, but I sorta fell in love with her morally ambiguous and sometimes cruel little heart.<br /><br />She was the sole reason I kept reading...right up until Blomkvist and Vagner meet. From that point on, it felt like I was in another hemisphere reading a completely different book in a totally new language. Maybe I just related more to an uncle's pain and sense of loss, or was captivated more by his extensive and decidedly peculiar family history (sorta like the Adams family meets the Manson family). I know my interest is more peaked by the missingand the dead than capitalist crooks with dollar signs where their hearts should be.<br /><br />And when, finally, Blomkvist and Salander start working together directly...well that's when this book shined its brightest for me. I loved them together. I still didn't much care for Blomkvist as a man, and I think he's got some serious issues with women, but he and Salander just fit together in the story in a way that took me aback, I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />That's what I'll take from this book that both thrilled me and bored me. That's what I'll remember most. In time, maybe I'll forget the first two hundred or so pages and remember only the last three hundred and fifty or so. I don't consider this the greatest book I've ever read, and I do think there was a ton of superfluous detail that did nothing for the story at all. I liked it, though. Parts I completely loved. And the girl with the dragon tattoo...well, she just totally rocked.<br /><br />~*~*~*~<br />Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.and the dead than capitalist crooks with dollar signs where their hearts should be.<br /><br />And when, finally, Blomkvist and Salander start working together directly...well that's when this book shined its brightest for me.

B007BZM30M|3.0|I've probably ignored this song a hundred times, turned the station while it was on the radio during one of my drive time channel surfing sessions.  But, when Jimmy Fallon & the Roots teamed with Carly Rae Jepsen for one of Jimmy's jam sessions complete with kazoos, a triangle, a tambourine, bongos and literally toy percussion vibes this song came to life.  You owe it to yourself to see out the video and give this song a real listen.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|So as with all of Brian Wilson's songs the more you listen the more you hear, and this album is no exception. The first go around you think very nice. As you play it the third and fourth time your ears begin to pick up the genius of Brian Wilson. Brian's band and Jeffrey Foskett round out the true Beach Boy sound. The original guys Al Jardine and especially Mike Love are still great. Brian's voice is not what it was in the 60's but who's is.  Just buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I'm glad Mark Cuban finally wrote this book!<br /><br />I read it twice in a row and took lots of notes. There's so much value in this read.<br /><br />Mark emphasis on the journey that you have to take on, in order to achieve success and reach anything you want.<br />It's a journey and as Steve Jobs said: 'The journey is the reward'<br />All this is very inspiring and I would recommend it to anyone who is aiming big in this world, anyone who wants success and wants to learn from the bests how to work on it.<br /><br />I liked his philosophy and I can relate to his sayings. I have a similar view on 'The Business of Sports', because I myself am found of sports and even more of competition.<br />I believe that sports and further more the competition is a GREAT school for life.<br />Of course this is a huge advantage when you grow and get introduce to the real tough game of life, and then to the game of Business.<br />Like in the book, I consider Business the Ultimate sport.<br /><br />It's really the psychology of achievement of a competitor that is explained in a easy, fun and simple way so that we can relate to it and then follow with the best implementation.<br />I, like the author, believe in entering a 'never ending journey of improvement' is the best way to achieve success and fulfillment in your life and this in any field whatsoever.<br /><br />Congrats to the author for all his hard work, endeavors, failures and finally his great achievements (including this book)!
B007Q476KU|3.0|Although the movie was watchable, I found it to be lacking in so many ways.  I do not feel that the storyline portrayed the hype around the movie.  All in all, it was disapointing.
1936608898|5.0|Melissa and Dallas have written a wonderful book! They have such a gift for explaining complex biological processes in a clear and understandable way.  They explain what food does to your body once you eat it and the effect it has on your health.  The title of the book is perfect because you truly come to understand that whatever your health is, your well-being, your happiness, your \\"whatever\\", it really does Start with Food!  Their Whole 30 program changed my life and I am so happy that countless people will be able to follow it after reading this book.  I highly recommend It Starts with Food to anyone who truly wants to change their life in positive ways!

0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins' book \\"The Hunger Games\\" tells a great story that can appeal to many different types of readers. The story is about a young woman living in a dystopian nation. In this nation the government selects two teenagers from each area of the country to compete to the death, in this way the government maintains control of its subjects through fear. What makes this book great is that it can be as meaningful as the reader wants it to be. The book is a very easy read which appeals to people looking for a simple story. On the other hand, if the reader is looking for an Orwellian style story about corrupt governments, this book has that as well. The political ideologies that are discussed are subtle enough that it doesn't ruin the story line, but present enough to get the reader thinking. The main character could just as well be compared to Prometheus from Ayn Rand's book \\"Anthem,\\" as she could be compared to Juliet. Whether you want to read the book for its tale of a child overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds, or for its storyline of resisting oppressive governments, or for one of a million other reasons, the fact is you should read the book.
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|The movie was all around very well done and is not the reason this product got only 2 stars, if it was JUST the movie itself I would have given it 4 or 5.  The fact that this only comes with an \\"Ultraviolet Digital\\" copy instead of a fully usable, real digital copy is why I gave it 2 stars.  I like to take my movies with me on my iPad or laptop (which doesn't have a BD drive) and when I'm on the road I don't have wifi access so I can't stream the UV copy with out using all 5gb of my data plan.  So without a legitimate downloadable digital copy this version of the movie should be at least $10 cheaper since you can only watch the UV copy where you have wireless internet.

B000W93CHC|4.0|Very good story, but too detailed in sex and not enough on building stuff. It's a bit long, should should be titled a book without end.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Probably the summers biggest box office disappointment.  One of the most anticipated films...was one of the biggest flops.  I hope the other summer releases are not as disappointing.  I'm not making this a long review. (Who actually reads those things?)  But, you may want to save your money and just catch it as a rental. It's probably worth a buck or two.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I have always loved this movie but I guess from a distance.  I was scared to death when I first saw it but now that you know the ending it does not have the same impact.  However, the transfer is pristine and it allows you to focus on details that you would have otherwise missed.
0425263908|5.0|I know people are comparing this to 50 shades series but I think they are different in their own sense. I absolutely loved this book, couldnt put it down....I am very sad I have to wait soooooo long for the 2nd one, hopefully the 3rd is not too far out from the 2nd?? I am also hoping they branch off with the other characters like Cary?? We will see.. Anyhow can't get much steamier than this book. Loved the chemistry right off the bat, the naughty talk and impulsive encounters.. Great job Miss Day If I could give 10 stars I would.......Cant wait for the next

Particularly those of us that have never created anything more than the toxic waste we feel the need to spew on open forums.<br /><br />That being said, my son and I enjoyed the hell out of this film in glorious IMAX 3D. The sound and visuals were simply the best I have witnessed. This is how you deliver on a cinematic promise folks. No - this is not Alien, and this isn't 1979 either. And, although I'm not 11-years-old like I was back then, I sure felt like it watching this film. Looking forward to adding the Blu-ray to my collection. And yes, it's going right next to my Alien Blu. Deal with it spanky.
B000WLIEKK|5.0|My title says it all. This album is a complete masterpiece.<br />For those of you who don't know, Alter Brige is basically Creed without Scott Stapp.<br />Mark Tremonti's guitar kept goosebumps on me pretty much the entire album. The uniqueness and pureness of the vocals were flawless and quite a nice change of pace from most other hard rock bands. I am so glad that they didn't put the title track as one of the beginning couple songs. It was well worth the wait.<br />Honestly, there is not a single song on this album that I am not completely in love with. Especially the intoxicating melody of the final song.<br />Clean good music. No language and no references.<br />Five stars is NOT enough for this album but since that's all I can give it, that's all I'll give it.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|The movie makes you feel like you are 10 years old again.  If you read Burroughs Barsoom books that the movie is based on as a kid and had a sense of wonder and a smile on your face, this movie will give you that feeling again as an adult.  It is also one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over again.  Part of this is due to the plethora of details in the film - you'll notice something new each time.  The other reason is because it's fun.  Do you find yourself watching Waterworld when it is on cable for the 100th time?  You'll find yourself doing the same with John Carter.  It's funny, it's fun, there's some great moments, it's not perfect, the marketing was terrible - what everybody else that liked it said.

B002VX0A40|5.0|This toy is really cute! It hangs down about 12 inches from the hook to the bottom of the tail. My daughter is only 6 weeks old but she already loves it. She'll stare at it and even wave her arms around like she wants to touch it, so I'm sure she will appreciate it even more as she grows. The feet and wings are crinkly, the ball has little beads in it, and the tail has a little mirror attached. Love it, wouldn't change a thing about it.
B007VGXS8M|2.0|Not comparable to the book whatsoever. In the book you never had a time limit, you could just sit back, relax, and just take a look.<br /><br /> In the game you have a time limit, which isn't relaxing.<br /><br />If the creater made a no time limit mode, then I would change my rating.

1594203059|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!  It is so thoroughly footnoted that one must say it is a history book.  But most important is that it removes the \\"fog of war,\\"  or the \\"fog of facts\\" that often shroud history is a mystic veil over understanding.  Niall's modern approach of key \\"apps\\" that explain the key dynamics in the last 500 years clears the mist of history and brings it into clear focus!  It provides understanding so that one can learn and see ahead.  Knowledge and understanding is power, and this book is a megalith of wisdom.  It should be required reading for all highschool and first year college students.  Niall, a sincere THANK YOU.
B003K16PFU|1.0|the subject of this book ie the spanish civil war is hardly known nor understood by most people who do not live in spain. this book adds very little to understanding the issues or the players. the titles of the parties are so numerous that it is very confusing to tell which stand for what and why and why i should care.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is my second full-length King novel and it certainly didn't disappoint.  With lively descriptions and colorful characters, you'll feel as though you yourself have stepped back in time.  You'll wish for a chance to see how your own \\"what ifs\\" could play out, and then you'll think better of it.  With twists you won't expect (and some you will) and characters so real you'll want to meet them, this book will keep you engaged from page one and guessing/racing to the very satisfying end.

This book appeals to both the individual looking for optimal health, as well as nerds like myself that have to know how and why everything works.  They explain how and why food can be linked to all kinds of conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, depression, and even chronic tendonitis.  The information contained in this book is something that everyone should learn, no matter what their goals.
072325804X|5.0|The quality of the book and packaging was absolutely superb.  I couldn't have anticipated anything better.  The jacket on the book protects strong binding, both are stored in a high-quality cardboard box decorated to match.  I can't say enough good things about the book, the graphics are beautifully done, the pages are of good quality.  So excited and can't wait to read the stories to our little ones someday. If you haven't read the stories, they're timeless classics, and if you have read them - well, they're timeless classics that young and old will adore.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love it , but it doesn't have the colorful coins like in the IPod app. Also, he isn't wearing his hat!!! xD
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome reading!  The first book of the \\"Shades\\" Trilogy was fantastic! I know I enjoy a book when I can hardly put it down and cannot wait to return home from work in order to pick up where I left off!
B0086700CM|5.0|at first I hated this game because it was so popular and annoying so I never played it. my friend had it on her ipod so I tried it. then I got obsessed with the game! I went on an 18 hour drive and that is all I played. it is great because its free... but it is stressful too because u are scared ur gonna die!! I think u should buy it!!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is amazing. I play it all the time. at least 5 times a week. beet game iv played in the last month.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|The Rider returns in this sequel/reboot. Everything that was good in the first film is retained and all of the dopey nonsense is discarded. Then the amp is turned up to 11. Cage brings the crazy, Neveldine/Taylor bring the mayhem. The new film suffers from a middle section that drags a bit, but by the end I was left wanting to see more filmed adventures of Johnny Blaze.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think one of the most fun things to read about was Anna's \\"inner goddess\\"...she cracked me up.  E.L.James really knows what a woman will think, of course, it takes one to know one!  Bravo, just sad that the trilogy is over!
B0086700CM|5.0|Been waiting for kindle to get this app!  I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much as I have on my iphone.
0345803485|5.0|Well writing is not the issue here. She is very capapble of dragin us along into the orgasm. Slow and sure. Why would you say he is not good. maybe not harvard but she gets women. OMG I have not finished the first and you are completely wrong. Get what the customer wants.....
0156027321|5.0|I am not a writer by any means. I am a reader by all means. I cannot describe here the number of books or the kinds I have read however I can tell you this one means everything.<br />It is unbelievable and that is what caught me offguard. That so many people would pick this book to be \\"the book\\"  to read.  I didn't want to read it. And yet. Eventually I gave in to peole coaxing me to do so...<br />this doesn't matter...that I'm not a writer...I'm just a reader<br />I can't critique something I'm in-love with<br />I have a collection of books...only the best remain....all else given away<br />Life of Pi is on my shelf<br />and every time I walk by it I look at it and I'm punched in the face with it and I think \\"I didn't see that coming.\\" My stomach hurts, tears well and then I smile...<br /><br />such a different ending to such a marvelous book!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book of \\"Shades\\" just continued to get better.  Again, difficult to put down.  I was happy letting life go by while reading to see what was next in store for Anna and Christian!
0439023521|5.0|This book pulls on your heart strings, and makes you fear the up coming situation with the characters.  Katniss is sassy sarcastic and likeable.....The men in her life pull you two ways and you want them both to be happy with Katniss.  True Devotion to a human life is shown here....couldn't be a better book.
B007L5KT76|5.0|SHERLOCK HOLMES: GAME OF SHADOWS is the follow up to Robert Downey Jr.'s and Jude Law's very successful action-adventure SHERLOCK HOLMES. The entire cast is reassembled for GAME OF SHADOWS, including Kelly Reilly as Mary Watson and Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler.<br /><br />GAME OF SHADOWS concerns the first showdown between Holmes and Professor Moriarity (Jared Harris), the brilliant but evil genius who is Holmes' nemesis. The year is 1891, and Europe is on edge due to a number of assassinations and bombings. Each nation is blaming the other, and it seems that World War I will break out 23 years early. Only Holmes realizes that Moriarity is behind it all, for reasons of his own.<br /><br />Moriarity attempts to destroy Holmes by targeting Irene Adler and the Watsons. Fortunately, Holmes has new allies as well, including his older, smarter, even more eccentric brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) and Madam Simsa Heron (Noomi Rapace) who leads a gang of revolutionaries once coopted by Moriarity but now fighting against him.<br /><br />GAME OF SHADOWS outshines the initial film. The pacing is faster, the scriptwriting more crisp, the humor more incisive, the action less pyrotechnic. If the film has a relative weakness, it is in the female leads. Kelly Reilly and Noomi Rapace both give well-acted performances in inconsequential \\"pretty girl\\" roles. Rachel McAdams is wonderful, but her part in GAME OF SHADOWS is much abbreviated. This is really a men's buddy film nonpareil. Downey and Law, having given us the backstory of their characters in the original film, have incredible chemistry together as Holmes and Watson, and are able to explore in depth the complicated, sometimes ridiculous, often rivalrous relationship between the two men. All in all, it is great fun.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Simply amazing that after 40 years and 20 studio albums that they could come up with something as fresh and energetic as this.  I'm not going to get into a track by track review as many have but I will say that taken as a whole, this album is fantastic.  I've read a few of the negative reviews (and there literally are just a few) and can't understand them.  Especially for those that claim to be Rush fanatics.  Anyone claiming to be that simply cannot trash this one.  One of them even mentioned that Geddy Lee should go listen to some Billy Joel releases to figure it out.  Billy Joel, give me a break!  What the hell is someone like that doing reviewing a Rush release?  Go pull out those old, stale BJ \\"Big Shot\\" records and have yourself a good time!  This is for serious music fans who know and appreciate where Rush is coming from and where they are going.  I defy anyone to pull out a 20th studio release from any band (not that too many have survived long enough to put that many out) and compare it to this and not conclude that these guys still are putting out stellar music that is relevant and musically without peers.  The other guys (Rolling Stones anyone?) they just keep on touring on the back of the stuff they put out 20-40 years ago and could never dream of devoting an entire world tour to a new release.  Just buy it and enjoy!
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Why does every new BluRay have to come with a copy of the movie on DVD and an UltraViolet copy? Neither of these do anything for me! If I have the movie on BluRay, why would I want to watch it on DVD? And since I use Apple products and don't use Flash the UltraViolet copies do absolutely nothing for me.<br /><br />But I did really enjoy this movie. It wasn't quite as good as the first, but Noomi was awesome as always!
B005QUQP76|5.0|While I would like a few more buttons, the M60 delivers perfectly in every other respect.  I bought it because it is the best mouse out there for someone with a fingertip grip, and it lives up to my expectations.  All of the buttons are programmable, including the buttons that usually change the DPI.  Additionally, it feels much sturdier than it looks.  I use the mouse for both first-person shooters and MMORPGs, in addition to browsing and checking my email.  All of this is on two operating systems.  I have found myself relying on its DPI adjustment buttons for a couple of things, and once I adjust it there is once again no problem.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|We purchased this for our son to have while traveling. It keeps the Xbox 360 safe from damage. The picture quality is great for the small size screen. We often go for extended trips of over 3 weeks, so this allows our son to play his favorite games while on the road. He can also watch netflix when wireless is available, so that is an added bonus. We plan on getting a PS3 slim to take on future trips. Ds uses this at home also, and has it set up on a desk. This way he can get his gaming time, and we can get some TV time. He isn't bothered by the screen size at all and prefers it over the TV.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive. the graphics are nice and crisp. overall I say its a great game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recommend  this movie. I would like averybody to buy this wonderful English serie. I would like it to be undertitle in spanish.
B0086700CM|5.0|i was really happy when amazon got this app it works faster than on the ipod i hope amazon keeps trying to get some more popular apps.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I first had doubts about this bag and I was skeptical about the price 'cause its cheap and I had doubts about the quality but man, when the package came in, which was neatly packed, I was quite surprised about the quality of this bag. This is a good purchase.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I would love to give this game more stars because it was GREAT at first... then it started having problems. Once I downloaded the newest update it made it impossible to connect with friends and harder to advance since u cannot visit friends villages... I finally got irritated and quit playing.
B002NXQ0X8|2.0|I love Pete Yorn.  I buy everything he puts out without even listening to it first.  I did the same thing here and what a disappointment.  I never heard her sing before, so I should have listened to samples.  Her voice sounds so...fake.  Like she's trying to have a style, but it's not natural.  She sounds like a poor imitation of Norah Jones.  Thankfully there is one song on the album that she doesn't sing in.  So I was able to salvage something in the end.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I first heard Rush in 1976 when a buddy popped 2112 into his 8-track player. They have been my favorite band ever since. Since Snakes & Arrows is not one of my favorite Rush albums, I wasn't sure what to expect with this new release. Wow, it is better than I ever expected. This is definitely in my top 3 for best Rush albums and after more listens, maybe it will be number 1. I don't see how any Rush fan could be even mildly disappointed in the album. Every song is a treasure. Pure awesome sauce!
B0086700CM|5.0|first of all it is very entertaining when your bored and its really easy to get in to totally get it
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I love this case that I got for my new kindle fire. I have it in red and the color definitely pops. It is thin and protective. I only wish it had a little hand sleeve to be easier to hold while riding on a crowded subway, but I've heard other reviews that those sleeves can sometimes damage the screen so I guess I can't complain. All around, this is a great case!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting so long for temple run to come out.Then one day I went to go on the app store and it was the app of the day.My recamendation is to get temple run!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book was just as good as the other two and held my<br />attention until it was finished.  The ending was a surprise and a<br />good way for the author to end the series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|okay its royalty awesome but I would give it a five star if it didn't have any ad's if it had no ads then it would be a five star
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I'm not saying everyone will like this film, but sci-fi/fantasy/romance fans shouldn't be deterred by the bizarre critical reaction to John Carter.  Wooden acting? Uh, no.  Hard to understand? Um, only if your IQ is in the Celsius range. Derivative? John Carter (the book) is the thing from which may modern sci-fantasy tales were derived. Fun characters, lively action, interplanetery romance, great effects. I've yet to introduce this movie to a person in my acquaintance who didn't enjoy it. Thumbs up. Sequel, please...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Recently I've been hooked on various apocalyptic stories, that's how I wound up reading Wool. It was so much more than anticipated. Looking forward to reading more in this universe!<br />A deep thanks to the author.
0553386816|3.0|I found each story interesting and a good read. However, the end of each story left me cold. There were no surprise or interesting endings.  They just stopped.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just have to say that this game rocks! it is so awesome!  I have to say that the controls suck a little,  but it's still a good game.
1595828753|4.0|Part 2 is more lighthearted and funnier than Part 1, which is great for kids but maybe a step back for adults. It lingered too much on Toph's zany metalbending school. Don't get me wrong, it was funny but for a 3-part series, I was hoping to tackle a lot more of the main story in this book. Still, it does end on a high note that sets up the conflict in the final book (I hope). I would rate this book more along 3.25 stars but I rounded up since The Promise as a whole tackles interesting subject matter and maintains the integrity of the characters.<br /><br />As a stand-alone book it's not very strong but within the series, it's a good enough expansion of the Avatar universe for fans who can't let go of Aang and friends.
B000SW2F6M|4.0|this movie was good picture quality also good. i would recommend this to any one who likes to watch time period movies
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is kinda dumb but it addictive .....its so stupid but I love it ...the monkey bird things r a good touch but they look horrible. hahahahahahaha but u will love this game after the 3rd try. I know I did :) this game is so amazing nd I just love it....I cant stop playing.. :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was recommended to me by one of the brightest, most intelligent women I know. Since it came from someone only a couple of years older than me and with similar interests to my own professionally and academically as well I assumed our tastes in literature would also be similar. I was wrong. This book was incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most about the book is that it was poorly written. The character development and plot were weak. I was frustrated with how unrealistic the build up of relationships between characters were, and how downplayed the emotional and mental ramifications of these types of relationships were (and I'm not even talking about the physical abuse, I just mean it was unrealistic to think that a 22 year old woman who had never had a relationship would experience her first one, especially one of that type, in the fashion that was portrayed here). Additionally, the story was very repetitive. It was my impression that the author was trying to captivate the reader with each telling of a sexual encounter, and instead I found myself yawning and flipping through pages until the end, because each followed the same formula as the previous one.<br /><br />I chose to keep reading this book because I hate not finishing books and because I was stuck in an international airport with a delayed flight. I would describe my reaction at finally reaching the end and almost feeling some redemption that the story did not wrap up completely unrealistically neatly only to see \\"To be continued\\" as \\"enraged and disgusted.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the reason my friend enjoyed the novel while I did not lies primarily in the fact that she is married with a child while I am not (though I am in a happy, serious relationship). Maybe in a few years I'll understand why reading this type of novel may give some women a thrill, but I was extremely disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This product is satisfactory. I recommend it to anyone. It is quite addictive. It is worth the price. I am a fan of angry birds.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|well my cousin has an ipod and he already updated his game free-version while we're stuck here waiting 4 that update with much more designs and new things to communicate with!!!!!!!!  ;(  IM WAITING 4 THAT UPDATE!!!!!!!!

B00881VLCE|1.0|as soon as I installed on my kindle fire, my Dr. Web antivirus program detected 2 security threats! Beware and uninstall IMMEDIATELY!!
1936608898|5.0|First of all, let me come out and say this is NOT a book about dieting.  This is a book that teaches one how to maintain healthy eating habits for a lifetime.  Dallas and Melissa have spent the last few years educating thousands about nutrition and health.  They have created a website and do not charge one dime for the information they generously provide.  The information from their seminars, on their website, and the research that backs it up is all in this amazing book!<br /><br />I have personally witnessed firsthand how their Whole 30 program has changed people's lives.  This book presents the sound knowledge behind their claims and even debunks information about food that we were all once led to believe; information that has created a rise in type 2 diabetes and obesity, among many other inflammatory and detrimental diseases in this country.  With all of the answers in \\"It Starts With Food\\", they are realistic in their approach and address all possible questions or concerns one may have.  The Whole 30 has not just helped people with weight loss; it has lowered cholesterol, lowered blood pressure, reversed type 2 diabetes, reduced or eliminated arthritis symptoms and the list goes on.  This is no miracle.  You just truly are what you eat and this book teaches you the difference between nutrient-dense food and food that is not worth eating.<br /><br />They include many recipes plus the foundation to many recipes so that you can mix things up and never eat the same thing twice.  Having the choice of putting medication into my body or just putting the right foods into my body, obviously I will go with the latter.  This book gives the encouraging boost needed to get started on a healthful journey that can be sustained for life.  Genuine in their approach with some tough love thrown in, if you are serious about your health, this is the book that will undoubtedly educate you and change your life. You will never look at food the same again.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This I got just because I have never seen it and it sounded alright. It has been 36 hours and I already bought the sequel. I feel like I need to watch everything associated with Evangelion now, I am brainwashed because this movie is like Anime Robot Gods.<br />Great story line, amazing sequenced scenes and a thorough job on the English Dubbing. If you are a fan of anime(any genre of anime), robots, action, or just a good time waster, this is for you!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it is an cool game it is fast to download and install and it is fun and creative you get to draw
B0014NDXGA|2.0|Purchased the unit a year ago and all was well (2011). The unit still works well, but has developed a brown spot in the viewfinder.  A call to the customer service folks reveals that they know about the issue, but say it is a heat issue and not covered by warranty. This unit has never been in exteme heat even though I live in the high desert.  Hottest temp has been 93 and the unit should easily withstand that heat - I do! The repair is over two hundred dollars.  So for now, I'll live with the brown dot as long as it works.  When it quits, I'll buy another brand.  Sorry Bushnell, you need to review your warranty guidelines for this kind of defect.
1466401885|5.0|I originally started reading this book in hopes of filling in \\"space\\" after reading the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy. However, Beautiful Disaster stole my heart! It is by far the best book I have read in quite some time. You really feel as if you are in the story with them. Jamie McGuire does an amazing job of getting all the emotions of each character across. I truly felt every emotion, love and hate.My Favorite part about this book was that it wasn't one of those \\"we fell in love a week\\" things. There is actual time placed in the book. I couldnt put this book down. In fact, I've already re-read the book!
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I saw this on opening day and just got it in the mail. I finally have the Underworld Trilogy and the pointless Rise of the Lycans side movie. Since it was filmed in 3D the same way as Avatar, I am almost ready to buy a 3D tv and the 3D disc.
0385504225|5.0|Have read all of Dan Brown's books.  He does a mega amount of research.  Hope this one is made into a movie.  It was a great book -- good plot with lot's of mystery.
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence M. Krauss', \\"A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing\\" teaches the reader to begin questions with \\"How\\" rather than \\"Why\\" when it comes to questions regarding the natural world and teaches the reader to be critical of religious/philosophical claims regarding the origin of the universe, which Krauss feels should be answered by science since it is a question about the natural world.<br /><br />This book is a completely amazing page turner!  Lawrence Krauss explains cosmology and particle physics so well that even the layman could reiterate quantum  energy fluctuations of virtual particles in a vacuum verbatim!  From the beginning to the end of this book the reader should feel amazed by the grandeur of existing in such a universe or rather multiverse at such a time which has been said to be the \\"golden age of cosmology\\".<br /><br />It really is a truly amazing book and I highly recommend this to anyone who is agnostic-nonreligious-pantheist or even anyone who has a simple interest in the universe and how it works.  When I say I recommend this book for anyone \\"agnostic-nonreligious-pantheist\\" it is because this book is actually better suited for those who do not believe in a personal God.  The book is atheistic insofar as it explains the physical world for what it is and how it is; in the preface of the book Krauss invokes his mantra: \\"The universe is the way it is, whether we like it or not.  The existence or nonexistence of a creator is independent of our desires.  A world without God or purpose may seem harsh or pointless, but that alone doesn't require God to actually exist.\\" and Krauss states \\"The purpose of this book is simple.  I want to show how modern science, in various guises, can address and is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing: The answers have been obtained -- from staggeringly beautiful experimental observations, as well as from the theories that underlie much of modern physics -- allsuggest that getting something from nothing is not a problem.  Indeed, something from nothing may have been required for the universe to come into being.  Moreover, all signs suggest that this is how our universe could have arisen.  I stress the could here, because we may never have enough empirical information to resolve this question unambiguously.  But the fact that a universe from nothing is even plausible is certainly significant, at least to me.\\"
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I wasn't expecting this album to be so much fun.  A perfect mix of dance, rock and funk with some stirring mid-tempo and ballads added to the mix.  Song after song, I said it couldn't get better and yet it did.  The lyrics are insightful even on the dance tracks.  One of the best CDs I have ever purchased, and I have been buying music for 5 decades now.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|This is honestly one of the greater titles by Liam Neeson. People can blab and blab about all the \\"fake\\" things in it. But, I doubt they would know. Dire Wolves can and usually do reach that size. A spear could do what they did with them. And it is easy to imitate other animals' noises with practice. But, I think the only reason people complain is because there are no super agent, triple flip, 360 degree, pistol headshots coming out of his laser eyes.
145470246X|5.0|I purchased several books from the master beading serie. This one is by far my farorite. The explaination is very clear, even for a beginning-intermediate beader like me. Every project is so beauteful & inspiring. Highly recommand this book.
B004FK8RKG|5.0|yes i like it i put it on my helmet and i enjoy music on mortorcycle<br />thank you for the speaker
0061433047|4.0|I Shall Wear Midnight is much darker than the earlier Discworld Tiffany Aching books; and while a good story is not as fun to read.
B004LWZW88|5.0|My entire family enjoyed this movie. That is pretty dang hard to do since my dad thinks Citizen Kane is the best, my mom doesn't remember movies, my sister is a pony freak, and my brother \\"hates\\" family time. IMHO the only reason there are any bad reviews about the movie would have to be some knucklehead flaming because something in their day did not go right or they want to bring others down. I highly recommend this movie!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on the Amazon app store.  It's great to play and I recommend it to everyone.  I think it would be a great game for any age. Plays very cleanly on my device.  I play it all the time.  I have no complaints. To all the people who are complaining about it are just complainers and fault finders.  I very thankful Amazon continued to leave it free and not charge for it. Don't take my word for it, though, because it's free and if you don't like it you can just uninstall it.  But I promise you'll love it if you give it a chance.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies of the year.  This wasn't just some put together hackjob from Disney like they've been putting out recently (Pirates sequels ring a bell anyone). Anyway, don't listen to the critics, at least give the film a chance it deserves.
B00633W614|3.0|Seens to be a filler between the first part of the trilogy(that was a great read)and the third that I hope will be a great read.<br /><br />My opinion is that the book is not what I expect from Archer.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Rufus has once again blown me away.  \\"Welcome to the Ball\\" is amazing!!  \\"Barbara\\" is a beautiful song, and \\"Candles\\" makes me nearly cry.  The music is just beautiful and really paints a vivid visual as you listen.  The lyrics, are genius as usual, and the album flows so perfectly.  A must buy!!  \\"Montauk\\" funny yet sweet and a loving mention of his mother.  If you&iexcl;¦ve ever been to a dive you&iexcl;¦ll love the song &iexcl;§Respectable Dive&iexcl;¨ &iexcl;V one of my BFF&iexcl;¦s brought me to one once and I always flash back to the place whenever I listen to the song.  º<br />Great job Rufus!!!
0345802934|1.0|This book could have been reduced from 1300 pages in length to about 200 pages. Boring. Pommelled ideas over and over. I kept reading to find out what the hype about this author is. I know I will never read anything else by this author. Story was stupid and pointless. The science fiction element was never developed and left you hanging. Very disappointing and gruelling  experience.1Q84 should be retitled to IQ84. Reading a book like this can probably downgrade your IQ.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can't say enough about this app!  I love being able to access my notes and reminders no matter what device I am using. Download skitch and the package is complete!
0062014102|5.0|This book is not for light reading.  It is very detailed with lots of technical information to make you understand how holographs work.  It takes a certain amount of patience and perseverance to continue with it's reading. However, if you choose a book with a title like this you have to be the kind of person who can deal with it.  I have not finished reading it as yet but I can tell it's one of those books that's best read twice.  That being said I'm glad I got it because it is a real education and so mind expanding.  A keeper for the spiritual seeker.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the hype that went before the launch and interviews with some of the more highly rated talk shows I blindly went ahead and downloaded it at the outrageous price of what???.... something like $17.00 or more. Then to find myself trying to continue reading it  only find it got more and more ridiculous. The english language was sorley lacking of any imagination and very repetitive.An absolute waste of time. How it got to the rate that it did astounds me. I will be sure to read the reviews from now on before I buy anything....By the way your prices are getting so high I am not going to continue to buy. At least with the paper book you can pass it on and for this price I will consider the latter...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|... and not that good, anyway.<br /><br />I read this book looking for a steamy romance novel. I like silly stuff like that, and maybe a little bit of \\"excitement\\" to make my heart beat a little faster!<br /><br />This is not a romance novel, FYI. It is literary porn. There's no story to talk about, really, just unbelievable excuses to have raunchy sex. The phrasing is redundant and there isn't much attention to creative writing. The characters repeat themselves and the descriptions are used over and over again, so even though there are a hundred and one \\"sexy\\" scenes, once you've read one, you've read them all. After the first couple \\"sex scenes\\", I just wanted to throw my Kindle down and move on with my life... but I powered through, so that I could have the authority to say, \\"Yes, I read it. It was awful.\\" The story ended abruptly with a dozen loose ends, and YES I know it is part of a trilogy, but I am more than happy to leave these uninteresting characters where they lie. Goodbye, ANASTASIA STEELE. I'm going to stick with more deeply moving romances. Maybe I'll read Pride & Prejudice again, just to cleanse the palate.<br /><br />Basically, if you're looking for mindless descriptions of rather BRUTAL sex scenes, Here's your book! Enjoy! If you're looking for something with more story, more romance and a talented writing style, keep looking.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I'm not one for breaking down every song and writing lots about each.  But I do want to give my 2 cents and say I truly think this is a great album.  I'm still in the first impression stage as I just picked it up last night but from where I stand right now I'm really enjoying it.  Musically, lyrically, the whole package.  It's hard to explain but when I hear a great Rush song it transports me back to when I was younger, makes me feel like clueless teenager again. This entire CD has done just that.  I couldn't wait for lunch today so I could run out to my car and pop the CD back on.  It's funny I always have an overwhelming urge to thank Geddy, Neil and Alex personally after a new CD is released.  A lot's changed over the decades but the one constant has been great music by my favorite band of all time :).  If you're on the fence, pick up Clockwork Angels....it will not disappoint
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|it does tell u how much memory it takes its 6.6 Mb look at the product info just telling everyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My brother in law told me I should check out this series from a North Carolina author whom his brother knows.  OK, I'm looking for something new to read.  Well, I'm sure glad I did! I'm sure that this will make the big screen in no time. I see that hundreds of others have explained what the books are about, so I'll just add my two cents in confirming that no one could possibly be sorry they bought this omnibus.  Don't even bother with just getting the first story as a stand alone, because you'll want to buy the rest anyway, I guarantee it.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|This movie is the perfect cure for insomnia. You will get your badly needed slumber during the long and quiet segments with the actors chatting. Suddenly the sound will increase by 100% with dramatic music during the wolf attacks. This will be your alarm clock so you don't oversleep. You will definitely be snoozing for the very disappointing ending. Stay tuned for a brief scene after the credits which may of been included due to audience complaints. It is quite obvious that wolves never act like that, so just think of this as a horror movie or the senior version of \\"Teen Wolf\\". Don't waste your time or money on this one.
0345803485|1.0|This book...this book..this book. Please. As an avid reader, and one who enjoys the occasional bit of erotica, I was excited to see one of 'those books' being hyped. I shouldn't have been. Fifty Shades is nowhere near what I thought it would be. The lead character, Ana, is unbelievable and the, um...love interest(?), Grey needs only to don a cape to be any more unrealistic. I hate the use of the word 'baby' in any context, and I seriously think it appeared in a book about Dom/Sub relationship exploration no less than 300 times. I know that this is the first of a trilogy, but I cannot bear to think about reading another word on this sub-par plotline.

B007UWBGVS|5.0|Adam has said this is the kind of music he loves, and he has created a treat for us.  Great funky fun music for dancing (I found that the first half is a perfect 25 minutes for my elliptical machine workout at the gym - also great for walking).  The second half is composed of gorgeous ballads with lyrics that mean something, both to him and universally to anyone.  Overall, his beautiful voice and harmonies make this such a great listen.  It has funk-electronic-dance-rock blended to perfection.
B0086700CM|5.0|Totally. Completely. Awesome. I love LOVE. this game its so so fun and I can't stop playing it. FUN FUN FUN FUN I LOVE THIS GAME :)(:
B007PTJOV0|5.0|So much fun! This app is so cool. can't. believe its free! My kids and myself enjoy it. Thank you!
1936608898|5.0|FINALLY!!!  I have long awaited this book and it's HERE!  I discovered the Hartwig's awesome website/blog long ago and the best of the basics are condensed in these 320 perfect little pages.  What I loved about this book was the utter honesty and love that shine through as you read it - it's funny, serious, scientific, real.  These two actually care about what they are talking about and they speak at a level that is easy for anyone to understand.  Even if you like the more scientific approach they give you that - seriously, they have 20 pages of references!  Being a vegetarian I am turned off by a lot of these \\"paleo\\" books but this is more about FOOD, all food, and what it does in our bodies after we put it in our mouth.  I appreciate that they speak to their entire audience - vegetarians, vegans, athletes, pregnant/breastfeeding moms, kids.  This book will raise your body awareness and make you look at food in a whole new way.  Then, your life will be changed for the better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good old game. I just love this game  for passing the day away. wish i could change the background though. have fun.

0060763280|5.0|This is one of those books that makes you slap your head and go \\"oh, I get it now!\\"<br /><br />T. Harv Eker uses simple examples to provide powerful insights into the psychology behind how wealthy and successful people think vs. those who struggle with money.  I won't say that mindset is the only reason why some people are wealthy and others aren't, but after reading this book you'll realize that it is an essential component.<br /><br />I also recommend this book to anyone interested in personal development because the concepts are universal.  It makes you realize just how much of a role your beliefs play in all areas your life, and then you start to question everything you've been taught.  You'll begin to notice how all of your thoughts are affecting your life.<br /><br />For instance, you can read this book and simply change the word \\"wealth\\" to \\"health\\" (or anything else one wishes to achieve) and you'll find most of the concepts remain the same.<br /><br />This is one of my top 10 must reads books for success in life, so if you haven't read it, get it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Thanks to Fifty Shades I have had many sleeplessness nights, made me late for work and late dropping the wee one off to daycare and I'll do it all over again with books two and three.<br />I usually don't get so engrossed into romance novels,however, this romance story has a sadistic twist.  Parts of this book even made me blush which is saying a lot because PG is not in my nature.<br />** Careful this book will make you realize the lack of excitement in your marriage. I often sulk around the house demanding my husband to be more like Christian Grey.<br />***My one annoyance is the constant use of the words \\"inner goddess\\" much over kill on the use of these wording.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome it is the best game I ever had .<br />um....,........its pretty awesome I'm 9 and I think its pretty heart taking good
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Wonderful!!! you have to see these guys live to appreciate how good they are.<br />I always listened to them before when i was in the mood,there first cd really stood out as something different really quite marvelous!!!.<br />I have them all now and play nothing else hardly, this is certainly one of the best,long may they continue to delight and charm audiences they seem to get better and better and i can,t wait for there next tour.

After staying up all night to read this book I could not stop thinking about it. I read a lot of reviews about this book comparing it to the Fifty Shades Trilogy and I am sorry to have to say this but it is not. Gideon and Eva are in a league of their own.<br /><br />Eva has just graduated from college and has gotten her dream job in New York. She moves to New York with her best friend Cary who is the epitome of HAWT SEX ON A PLATTER! But she and Cary are best friends and they stick together no matter what. On her first day in New York she decides to go for a walk and to time how long it takes to get from her apartment to her new job. As she is walking enjoying all of the New Yorks sceanry she stops off at her new place of employment to see where she will be working. When she leaves the office building a women who is also leaving drops her purse and everything in it goes everywhere. Eva being nice helps the lady pick up everything but as she is going to retrieve some stuff she looks down and there are these black pair of shoes and when she looks up she is captivated by this GEORGEOUS man!<br /><br />This is the beginning of the end for Eva because she is enthralled with this man. She goes home and tells Cary all about Mr Dark and Mysterious because she can't seem to get him out of her mind. Then at work she finds out who Mr Dark and Mysterious really is and she can not believe it. Eva can't stop thinking about Gideon and Gideon can't stop thinking about Eva. Gideon in a bold move tells Eva he wants her in every way possible. Eva is no dummy and she can smell bad boy and trouble all over Gideon so she tries to resist but what is a girl to do when she is being persued by the HOTTEST man in New York.<br /><br />As Eva gets to know Gideon she finds herself enthralled with him and obsessed with him. The only thing is when it's good it's good but when it's bad it's bad. Eva knows she has some secrets and she is sure he has some secrets as well but she exposes her secrets and when Gideon does not share his she secrets Eva decides it is not worth the hassel or the heart ache to stay with him. After leaving him she is miserable and as she is trying to get over Gideon he decides he wants her and chases after her. Her will power to resist him breaks and she decides to give him another chance.<br /><br />What is Eva to do? Can she love a man who is so controlled and needy at the same time? Will the secrets kill each other? Will the other women in Gideon's life break them apart? This is a must read for ADULTS!

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is the best app created in my opinion. (: It is so addicting but fun! And if you have nothing to do, a great time passer! There is no doubt you shouldn't get Temple Run!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good program sleek design. Not so accurate. Sometimes forecast doesn't even fit the radar. I found the weather channel app to be a slight more accurate for my area.
0345803493|4.0|OK so I finished all 3 50 shades books.  I like most of it, especially the way the author incorporated modern technology into the story line. I a not really into the dominant/submissive lifestyle, but if someone actually encouraged me to eat, like the character Christian did, I would take a spanking or 2!  The author also seemed knowledgeable in describing the other aspects such as hang gliders, helicopters, jet skis, etc., making the experiences seem realistic.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I've been waiting for this product for two days and when it got here I was so amazed at the speed.  I had forgotten to order it when I purchased my Kindle Fire.  I read a lot and this USB cable will help me to store my books in a different location so that I can make more room for more books.  It also helps me to download updates for my Kindle Fire so that it will be up-to-date and performance better.  I'm very happy to have it now and have been able to add and subtract things to my Kindle which allows me to customize it to my style.  Its a must have item for the Kindle Fire.
0439023521|1.0|I cannot believe the rave reviews that this book has received.  If you at all enjoy reading well-written books, please don't waste your time with this one. This book I can compare to fast food where you want a quick bite rather than a savored delicious meal. Don't get me wrong, I love a quickie at McDs every now and then. But I would not rate it as a five star restaurant!<br /><br />I read this because I felt obligated, as it was a birthday gift. I normally don't read fictional genre. If I do, I would like the plot & charcters to be believable.  This book is so far-fetched it should have been made into a cartoon and not a movie. I read the first 2 chapters, got bored and read the last chapter just to find out what happened in the end.<br /><br />Warning:  For people who enjoy reading good quality books....don't be fooled by the reviews.
B0086700CM|5.0|very addicting gameplay. this game does not get tiring at all. I love how there is objectives as well as the regular gameplay.
0226039331|5.0|Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature is a masterpiece for serious Bible students. It could be used by the regular student of the Bible as well as the one who is in Seminary. The only thing is that you need to know the Greek alphabets and know how to read basic greek. I use this dictionary quite often, during my studies. Iam not a seminary student, but do learn the Bible. In a couple of days I did a quick study of the basic greek alphabets, know how to read words and sentences in greek, (though I cant understand) and that's all you need to know to use this lexicon. For each word, it gives the different meanings according to the context in which it is used. I believe each and every word in the Bible has depth, when used in context. This definitely is an awesome tool for the serious learner of the Word of God.  God bless.
B007ZQHMPI|5.0|These books are hard to put down.  Besides the steamy dark romance there was a great story line.  I hope E L James continues to write as she kept me entertained.  I am now looking forward to a movie coming out!

B0087YZBMS|3.0|I've been fascinated by Amy MacDonald's music since her debut album This Is The Life.  While I thought she took a step forward with her second album A Curious Thing, I believe that she has taken a step back with Life In A Beautiful Light.<br /><br />First and foremost too many songs (\\"Pride\\", \\"Slow It Down\\", and \\"The Furthest Star\\" for starters) on this album suffer from the overly repetitive lyrics found on This Is The Life.  The worst offender is \\"Slow It Down\\".  After the second chorus she repeats the phrase \\"down down down down d-down down\\" enough times that I couldn't count them.  It is a shame because the song is otherwise really good, and it ties back nicely to \\"I Got No Roots\\" with the vocal rhythm on the chorus.<br /><br />In addition to repeating lyrics within a song listeners will also find repetition across songs.  It stood out to me how many reference to dreams this album has:  \\"The Furthest Star\\" - \\"My dreams fell apart\\", \\"The Game\\" - \\"Why did I dream last night?\\", \\"In The End\\" - \\"Wishing I was dreaming.\\"  If you try to determine what MacDonald thinks about her dreams, you could at best offer, \\"It depends\\".<br /><br />Life In A Beautiful Light does continue the trend of sounding more mature.  Some songs are melancholy \\"The Furthest Star\\", some sad \\"The Game\\" \\"Left That Body Long Ago\\", while some are hopeful yet earnest \\"Across The Nile\\" and \\"Human Spirit\\".<br /><br />As for stylistic changes there are a few nuances that I found different from MacDonald's previous work.  She uses a fair amount of vocal harmony on \\"The Green And The Blue\\".  I thought \\"4th Of July\\" and \\"The Days Of Being Young And Free\\" seem to have more of a pop influence than I recall in the past.  The last thing may seem like a bit of a stretch, but the guitar lick playing in the background of \\"Across The Nile\\" reminds me of \\"New Year's Day\\" from U2.<br /><br />In the end, I think that Life In A Beautiful Light is an OK CD.  There are parts of it that I like and find interesting, but I am disappointed in the regression in Amy MacDonald's lyrics.  She is still a very talented artist, and I hope that she bounces back on her next album.<br /><br />Download this:  Across The Nileam disappointed in the regression in Amy MacDonald's lyrics.

0061714402|5.0|I loved this book.Dave has been thru some very hard times and he left nothing out.He is very open about himself and he left nothing out. It is amazing he his still alive.Not one part of this book is boring and he never rambles on.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I got OfficeSuite Pro for free from Amazon appstore. It is too slow rendering PDF documents. It is more than ten times slower than QuickOffice and other viewers.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this for my kindle fire and its amazing,  I also have it on ipod touch . the only difference between the two, is on kindle fire it lags like every 1/40 times you play (ex. when you swipe to jump it delays it by a few milliseconds and then causes you to jump off the ledge ) same with turning. but overall its an amazing,  fun,  addicting game and I love it. 5 stars<br />my highscore is 8,973,462
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The writing was beautiful, the story unique, the characters riveting.  I did not want to put the book down!  Yes, the author hops back and forth in time, but seriously, the chapters are dated and you can follow the story line with very little effort.  I marvel at the creativity of this author; the book was a masterpiece!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I generally don't review books because so many \\"reviews\\" are manipulated. But after seeing such a string of one-star reviews I felt the need. I hated this book my first time through. Honestly, I did. I felt that it strung my along with a promise of \\"all will be revealed\\" and then failed to deliver.<br /><br />So I read it again. And again. A total of ten times now.<br /><br />First off, my sales have increased a total of 1,000 percent by using the information provided inside of this book. And yes, the keys to getting your sales off of the ground are inside. You simply have to dig around to find them. I agree that a lot of it is promotion on his part. But I simply cannot argue the fact that my Twitter following has risen from less than a hundred six months ago to twelve thousand avid readers and climbing by the day.<br /><br />If you are looking for a \\"how to publish\\" book, this isn't it. It never made the claim and I don't understand the negative words thrown it's way for failing to do so. It is a book that will show you(in due time) how to market your book. John doesn't spoon feed the secrets of how to get rich quick. If he did, I wouldn't have bought into it. He simply gives you the direction you need in terms of marketing, tells you only hard work will get you there and wishes you well. It doesn't sound like a lot, I get that. Still, I have read this book a total of ten times now and have learned something new each time.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Three little words that I have to describe this book: \\"Just Read It !\\" Flynn has written a novel whose female protagonist seems downright likable initially. As the plot line develops, the reader is plunged into a world of a pathological narcissistic liar whose needs for power and control is absolute. I devoured this book in five short days.Truly a best read for 2012.
B005K17RU0|4.0|its really cool but it freezes at times when ur on satelite to look at storms otherwise great! I would suggest it to any1 looking for a weather app
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was so excited to finally have my copy of fifty shades of gray, that  I was so disappointed, when I read it. Honestly is just twilight for adults. Anastasia is just like Bella, she doesn't know how beautiful she is, she is so clumsy, her mom's a little crazy, she can't believe he likes her. And of course Cristian is Edward a Greek billionaire god, who is always afraid of her safety, he makes her expensive gifts which of course she just can' t accept, even the scene at the Ihop is identical to the little Italy in twilight. So for me, the plot was just lame.<br /><br />As for the erotic part, it's just  unbelievable how he looks at her and she immediately orgasms, honestly it's just boring. I liked the ending though, it's unexpected, and it makes you just wanna grab the second book, and see what happens next.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok, I'll admit it.....I read all three books.  Friends and Family kept asking if I had read them and I hadn't even heard of them.  When I checked at our library, I found that some 550+ people were already waiting for this book so I decided to wait and hope someone I knew bought them.  As it turned out, my daughter (23) brought them home from one of her employers and the adventure began.<br /><br />I didn't hate the book but I didn't love it either...there was just too much missing.  Anna seems almost mythical in her naivete and you wonder how she survived college, while Christian seems to be a knight in tarnished armor with a kinky side.  Nothing about their relationship rings true and you just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  There were a TREMENDOUS amount of repetitive words and phrases to the point where I kind of wanted to smack Anna because she kept biting her lip.  Seriously?  Seriously!<br /><br />If you are new to the Dominant/Submissive world, some of the scenes may set your heart racing and you may end up having to research some of the things you are unfamiliar with...but inevitably you realize that it is just brain candy...books written for entertainment...books meant to cause sexual excitement, not to engage your brain.  This is escapist fiction and it delivers what it promises....an escape from the ordinary world where most of us live.

B0061TQBRK|2.0|2009's Shallow Life, Lacuna Coil's first album with producer Don Gilmore at the helm, was widely criticized for its pop-rock oriented sound. The band was seemingly bent on shedding their Gothic roots in favor of a more generic, radio friendly modern-rock vibe that only vaguely echoed the best of their previous work. These criticisms were very much warranted, as Shallow Life was by far the blandest record released by the band up to that point.<br /><br />Lacuna Coil supposedly heard those criticisms, and during the production of their follow up, Dark Adrenaline, they weren't coy about their intent to release a darker, heavier album. Were they successful?<br /><br />Eh... not really.<br /><br />The only difference with regard to heaviness might be somewhat thicker sounding guitars, but that only serves to make the album sound even more dense, not heavier. Otherwise, the album is Shallow Life Part II. Don Gilmore was the producer at the helm once again, and as such, little has changed sound-wise.<br /><br />Is the album darker? Again, not really. The music is too bland to create a truly dark atmosphere. The lyrics are every bit as empty as they were on Shallow Life, if not more so. What are they really singing about on \\"Trip the Darkness\\"? Songs like \\"Against You\\" and \\"Army Inside\\" seem to recycle the confrontation/self-empowerment theme that was done to death on the previous album.<br /><br />Of course, lyrics have never been the band's strongest area. All of their albums have had their cringe-worthy moments, mostly due to their tenuous grasp of the English language. They've gotten a pass from most fans (including myself) over the years partly because they are Italian and partly because the ethereal beauty of their uniquely Mediterranean brand of Gothic metal rendered the actual lyrical content moot.<br /><br />However, on the last two albums, that transcendent beauty is basically gone. Gilmore seems to have sucked all of the space out of their sound. The intricate layers of clean and distorted guitars has been mostly replaced with an indecipherable wall of down-tuned power chords, making what layers are there fade into sonic mush.<br /><br />Gilmore isn't entirely at fault here, as the band creates few, if any memorable progressions or riffs. There's almost no palm muting or any other flourishes to make the guitars rhythmically or melodically interesting. They try to resurrect their layered sound at times on songs like \\"Kill the Light\\", but it comes off as a pale & lifeless imitation of their old sound.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the cover of \\"Losing My Religion\\" - it's absolutely terrible (which is a shame; I really liked their cover of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" off of Karmacode).<br /><br />The problem here is that the band ran with the flawed premise that heaviness and darkness = old Lacuna Coil. What really made Lacuna Coil special was their balance of of darkness & light, where aggressive & chunky riffs and pretty gothic arpeggios & synths could not just co-exist but together create a sound that rose above the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Waldemar Sorchyta (their previous producer) seemed to understand this. Even when Lacuna Coil's guitar duo made the somewhat foolish choice to embrace seven-string instruments full-time on Karmacode, Sorchyta found a way to balance the increasingly sludgy distorted guitars with the other elements of their sound. Andrea & Cristina's voices (while mixed perhaps a tad low on Karmacode) continued to soar effortlessly as they had in the past. Perhaps it's just the aging of their voices, but under Gilmore, the duo to me sound almost labored at times on Dark Adrenaline as they strive to stand out from the overly dense production.<br /><br />The packaging for Dark Adrenaline is every bit as generic as the sound. Once again, the color pallet is basically two-toned. A clear glass ampule replaces the crystalline hand grenade of Shallow Life as the focal point of the cover. The back cover photo is once again a shot of the band either trying to look hot (Cristina) or bad-ass (everybody else). It looks like it could have come from the same photo shoot that produced the back cover shot on Shallow Life.<br /><br />Dark Adrenaline is almost a carbon copy of Shallow Life in my opinion - dense, uninspired, bland. Neither album is offensively bad, they simply have lost the magic that made their first three albums and two EPs so incredible, at least to my ears. Those five CDs hold a special place in my collection (I'm a long-time fan going back to early 2001). My copies of the last two albums are bound for the used CD bin at my local record store. There is simply no redeeming reason for me to hang on to them.

I actually started by doing the p90x workouts and those were helpful in getting me started. However, even though I did get in good shape as far as low body fat (8%) and toned muscle after completing that program twice, I was having a very hard time gaining more size and strength. I tried many different lifting routines and different diet plans but I would always remain relatively the same with my strength and size. Now after reading Bigger Leaner Stronger (BLS) I know exactly what I was not doing, or better yet, over-doing this whole time. Most of the knowledge I gained from BLS concerns the proper ways of lifting for strength and growth (I was way off). Although my diet has been pretty close to what Michael recommends, it took me a ton of time and reading literally hundreds of forums and articles to eventually get to where I am today. I could have accomplished this so much easier by just reading BLS. He lays out everything very clearly and the whole book is very enjoyable from start to finish. The workout plan he lays out is straight forward and I couldn't be more excited to get started. My only problem is that I am recovering from surgery and have at least 3 more weeks before I can get started with any weightlifting. This is specially hard now after reading BLS, but once you read it you will know why. I am also starting his other book on Muscle Myths and looking forward to that read. I do plan to track my gains an post pictures once I start the BLS program and I will try and post them to this review. Overall, the book is a must read for anyone serious about weightlifting and specially for beginners. A perfect 5 out of 5 stars for BLS!
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game because it can be very time costly and can make u want to play it for hours it is soooooo much fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so addicting.  I wanted to go to the end to find out how it ended after I was about 1/4 done, but I didn't.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of the best games that I have downloaded for my kindle fire. it is an entertaining game with good graphics.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app! Works great on Kindle Fire, and the ads are minimal. I would recommend to a friend for sure.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|a must have to finish my collection  thought i woould not find  it once i realized most stores had already pulled from sales floor
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This was an amazing purchase Daft Punk at its best! Love this movie and the music. If you like edgy film scores that are aggressive then this is one for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so fun Cu's you run for your life and.you get new charachters and. turn invisable and stuff. the monkeys are ugly.though you can also get head starts
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|i bought this video for my kids,its picture quality is amazing,i dont find any difference  as  i compared it to the expensive blue ray print.and my kids just love kung fu panda....i feel very  happy and satisfied.
B00122A28A|5.0|Madonna is often cited as being in her prime during the 80s but this proved she still had some fire left. Her vocal range combined with William Orbit's genius produced an incredible album. Nothing Really Matters is my favorite song!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|As always, Nicholas has written another fantastic book.  He kept the story moving and very interesting at all times.  Kept you involved in what was going on in their everyday lives and how it affected his storyline, and I just loved this book.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|This is a great series. The story line is captivating and hard to stop watching!  We are really enjoying it!
0307593312|4.0|As you would expect Murakami takes you deeper and deeper into another world with every chapter. Like most of his books I am putting 1Q84 under psychological thriller.
B0086700CM|5.0|I recommend this app for anyone.  The game is totally awesome and is my favorite game.  Also workers great for kindle fire.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|not too hard but enough to be a challenge.  would like to be able to zoom in but was still able to play without too much difficulty. would definately recommend.
B004LROMWU|2.0|i was excited by the idea of a Spielberg TV series about aliens. I LUVS ALIEN SCI-FI SHOWS!!! i do not however enjoy the family values and family situations forced upon us by mister Spielberg and the execs at all the studios/tv corps. it makes this type of production boring. it seems that they will not decide who they want to watch their shows/movies - not enough sex and violence for most adults, too many adult ideas and situations for most kids. it's a mess. the storyline is not very original or intriguing. and they do that stupid \\"let's get a bunch of morons to make situations worse and get them into trouble because it makes a story\\".<br /><br />Someone has to say it, so i guess it's gonna be me. this production is the same as Mr. Spielberg's other flops (Tera Nova, War of the Worlds...). not sure why he has to do the family dynamics thing, but it has to stop. He could at least try to make it a bit more interesting by making the dad gay. if you want to see a good tv show about aliens and family values, watch Alien Nation. that was a great movie, then TV series. save your money on this one. Spielberg - move on already!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun. the only negative is you get so into it you start making loud noises in public&hellip; maybe it's just me.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am hooked on puzzles and this one has great pictures and is very easy to use! the colors are so vibrant as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the first time purchasing a book on Amazon for my Kindle iPhone app.  I was a little nervous about how it would work, but the process was very simple.  The book was great, and now I've moved onto book #3 of the Hunger Games series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hi and who ever created this game it os so totally awesome .. and you can earn so many points..So you are totally awesome
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|was excited to see an office app this deeply discounted. it really isn't tho as once you open it you find out you need to buy updates and add-ons for a few bucks each. I hate apps like this.  if I could give zero stars I would.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Considering that the book was topping the Amazon best seller books, I picked it up. I can't understand how such a sickening, immature book can reach the top of the charts. The characters are based out of America but everything is Brit. No one talks in the book, they murmur. The lead characters can't think of anything but sex. Sickening! I can't even be bothered to finish it !
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I can make an appointment on my Kindle and it automatically updates my Google calendar and vice versa. I can add my husband and son or anyone I have an email for and it generates an email invitation AND puts it on their calender. We can access the Google calendar from any computer wherever we are (even while at school my son can see he has an orthodontist appt) as well as my Kindle!
B0086700CM|5.0|omg i just lovey love love dis game sooooooooooooooooo much. trust me i want to add more o's. but its just so exciting and the charectors are so detailed. i just love it
0345803485|1.0|...and so does anyone who gave this book 5 stars. Seriously, \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavin deBecker. Christian Grey is the epitome of a man with violent tendencies. If you (unluckily) meet anyone like him in real life, RUN!<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, its hard to tell if this author is actually an adult. Surely any sane adult would either have called the cops or at least stopped engaging this psychotic man by now. Seriously the amount of warning signs in this book (couldn't finish it,  so even halfway thru) are horrifying. Her friends and family are worried for her and notice a negative change. She cries all the time. He mistreats her, either verbally or physically, and then apologizes, begs her love, and buys her something expensive. It's insulting! And the list goes on but others have mentioned it: he tells her what to wear, needs to know where she is at all times, gets insanely jealous at any other male in her vicinity, and does NOT listen to or accommodate her concerns. Any younger readers out there: this is not cute, this s not sexy, this is abuse! Someone out there will treat you well without any of that.<br /><br />What a waste of my life. the writing and character development were also atrocious.
B00445JSWS|3.0|At first, from my point of view it is not easy to describe this DVD/ CD  release of Depeche Mode. But after all, I think this release is not a real landmark of Depeche Mode. This one is the first official BlueRay production of Depeche Mode & like many people or fans, I hoped the best in things like sound & image quality. To both sides I just can give a good, but not very good or a amazing rating. I´m convinced that these original copies are not made in best form, but rather like the band saw the things at this time.<br /><br />I´m a fan of Depeche Mode since 1987, and I buy or keep not all releases of Depeche Mode, but this special DVD/CD/Blue Ray release is the first where I´m not sure - I think - I keep it more for sentimental value.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Rio is so much fun to watch! The plot is full of adventure, the music and animation are EXCELLENT, and the characters are soooo entertaining! My 5 year-old daughter and I cannot get enough of this movie. I highly recommend adding Rio to your animated movie collection! I also purchased the soundtrack, which is great for listening to in the car.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This 50 Shades of Grey trilogy is absolutely great. It was one page turner after another. I advise anyone who wants a little spice in your life to buy this triology you will fall in love with Christian Grey!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Okay, so I'm already a die-hard fan of science-fiction and ESPECIALLY dystopian fiction. This was like 1984 in its wonderful depressing setting and The Giver in its world-conspiracy intrigue, only with amped up suspense, thrills, intriguing characters (and not just the \\"good guys;\\" it's always refreshing for a villain to not be \\"evil,\\" or at least to have some explanation). Add in some post-apocalyptic ass-kickery, and really brilliant writing, and this book is an all-around winner. There were times I was on the edge of my seat (figuratively, I read in bed like most people), reliving traumas from Amnesia: The Dark Descent because I just *knew* that... well, I don't want to spoil it for you. Read this book!<br /><br />And, since Hugh Howey says he reads all his reviews, I just want to say to him:<br /><br />Thank you. When a book transplants me to another world and lets me live an adventure that I'll never have in real life, I always feel a tremendous debt to the author. Also, after finishing the latest A Song of Ice and Fire book, it was so nice to have, well, nice things happen in a book! Even if that book is mainly filled with despair. I look forward to reading more of your books, and to seeing what happens in the Wool universe. I think you've got a movie-deal coming eventually. I only ask that it be split up into a trilogy so that the story will be done justice, and that you are involved in production. And that I am cast as Juliette. Or Shirly. Or Mechanic #5. :D<br /><br />Lastly, I really appreciated the ongoing metaphor with the yarn (or wool). I'm a crocheter and it's lovely to see the things I appreciate appreciated by others. So thank you. I wish you all the best, Mr. Howey.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|couldnt put it down. you sure know how to tell a tale. six thumbs up!!! great character's, suspenseful and all together nifty bosso!!
0345803485|5.0|I got the book within 1week after purchase although after i purchased it it said it wouldnt arrive for 3 weeks  Even though it was used it looked brand new!
0765348780|3.0|I found this book a little too showy and confussing, and the characters lack some depth. Hope it gets better in the next one. (i've read book II in spanish but the translation was awfull). Regards from Buenos Aires, Juan.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I would reccommend this game to all viewers.  it is very fun .my friend Natalie showed me and I loved it so I got it .and now my friend Melisha loves it to .GET IT NOW HURRY UP OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF NO FUN.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Cute game. My only complaint is about how finicky the touch control can be.  Cute story, decent graphics.  Not too difficult.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|Sounding like the British Beyonce, Emeli Sande slides onto American soil with a smooth fusion of urban pop that is simply delectable.  Beginning the album as if in a confessional, the track \\"Heaven\\" gives us a head bobbing glimpse into a Sande prayer. Then in the same spiritual vein, the track \\"My Kind Of Love\\" professes the simple yet powerful message that when you're at your worst, that's when you'll be loved most.  As the album progress, Sande moves the mood downward singing of a relationship she had no idea was going down in flames in \\"Suitcase.\\"  Sande's ability to create both a sincere love song and and sincere break-up song on the same album is something truly special.  The most stand out track however is \\"Wonder (feat. Naughty Boy).\\"  This track is reminiscient of Fun.'s \\"We Are Young (feat. Janelle Monae)\\" and serves as an uplifting anthem for anyone and everyone.  Overall, the smooth composition of the album transitions nicely from song to song leaving the listener lost in the world of Sande.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy books and I can honestly say that I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a series a much as this one.
B002Q9MZHE|2.0|This product arrived on time and the price was great.  However, it is a movie version of this classic opera and the sync between the voices and actors is off.  Very annoying.  You can tell the voices were dubbed on a different track after the actors were filmed.  Very poor.
B000001FN3|5.0|What a bargain this was.  Such a rich album of great music.  I had this on vinyl a long time ago.  It was good to fgind it on CD.  I have never seen it in any store.  What a great find.  It is a true treasure.  It put Edgar Allen Poe to music as only Alan Parson could have done. The seller gave great service on this product.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have had this watch for about a month and so far i am very happy with it;<br />It has been very accurate, I have not had to reset it since I got it.<br />In my opinion it is the perfect size for my wrist. the design is simple and elegant, and probably suitable for any level of formality if put a leather band on it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I was wary that I would have a deficient case and my iPhone would be ruined. If you follow the instructions on the website, there is no reason for your phone to be ruined in water. I have brought mine swimming in the pool with me and it took great underwater pictures of my friends and I. The case is a little difficult to remove and it can't be placed on my iHome anymore to charge but it's worth not having to worry about my phone! Everyone should get one and I recommend the pink color!<br />Super cute and easy to use.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Get this game. its worth it. lol got this game for a dollar so strychnine if u haven to pay 6. I still would though.
0345803493|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SET OF BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. VERY HOT AND IN THE MOMENT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HER WRITE MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS BUT I AM GUESSING THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME TRILOGY. AND IF YOU ARE EASILY UPSET BY SEX TALK ETC WELL YOU SHOULD READ THESE BOOKS AND OPEN YOUR EYES TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is a manual for building the body of your dreams!  Mr. Matthews lays it all out-how to gain muscle and how to lose fat-and gives you the diet and exercise program to obtain the results you want
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|who doesn't like angry birds? i love angry birds! I don't know anyone who doesn't!  I love you angry birds! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083GPDBO|4.0|One of the most realistic depictions of real teenage boys that I've seen in a long time. This is a really refreshing take on a superhero movie, and doesn't mess with the core mythology of superheroes that so many of us like. Definitely worth seeing.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This anthology sets the bar for what every anthology and collection of multiple films should do.<br /><br />Least importantly it has nice, high quality packaging with fantastic artwork. It is something that will look great on a movie rack.<br /><br />Most importantly, this has all the features any Alien fan could want. With all films having theatrical and director's cuts, it is all the film anyone could want. The quality of both theatrical and directors cuts is great as well. There is just a little extra 'pop' with these films on blu-ray.<br /><br />As for special features, this anthology gets high marks as well. With over 50 hours of special features, there isn't much more one could want from the Alien Universe.<br /><br />Overall, extremely pleased with this purchase. I have not found one draw back to this anthology yet. Very highly recommend for Alien fans and even people who have never watched the films. Superb collection for a Sci-Fi classic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Like many other five star reviewers have said, I, too, read the complete series in a matter of days. Then, I went back and read all three books again...immediately. I have now finished reading them a third time. I don't disagree with the comments about some of the writing flaws, but I could certainly get past that to what really mattered...the love story between Ana and Christian.<br /><br />As for the sex...it just seems you can't please everyone. Some people think the sex is too explicit and others think it is not explicit enough. Some parts were a little too much information for me, but that didn't affect my enjoyment of these books.<br /><br />Now as for books four, five and six in this series....please....don't.<br /><br />I love the way the trilogy ends. Ana and Christian's \\"happy ever after\\". What would happen in the next books? Ana and Christian break up? They lose all of their wealth? One of them gets sick, incapacitated or dies? No thanks. I like the ending just the way it is.<br /><br />Although, having said that, I really did like the epilogue, if that's what it was, where we get to see Christian's point of view about his first couple of meetings with Ana. I wouldn't mind reading some more of that. I'd especially like to read about his feelings at the end of book one, when Ana leaves; and the part in Book Two where he offers himself to Ana as the submissive. Whoa!<br /><br />So, if there are more books to come in this series, I hope they revisit the love story from Christian's point of view and leave the future up to us to imagine.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and was cheering Caesar the entire time. I did wish the ending would've shown a better reunion, but was ultimately happy to see Caesar get back to his beloved redwoods.<br /><br />I didn't watch this movie for the science or possible facts. I watched because I wanted to see the beginning and to see \\"what if\\". It was just what I wanted and I thoroughly enjoyed it-- even the typical trope.
B004LROUNG|4.0|As usual John Gresham writes in a manner that makes the book into a \\"page-turner\\".  As a senior practicing lawyer, he depicts the legal profession in a most unflattering light (all are ambulance chasers) that I find offensive personally.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Love Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther novels. Bernie is a wonderful character full of morality and integrity overwhelmed by strong self preservation that ultimately causes him to want to self destruct.<br />In Prague Fatale the plot is excellant and character development outstanding. Heydrich came to life as did all the key players. I could have read this whole book non stop. The best Bernie Gunther novel yet. I cannot wait for the next.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I started this game with the intention of playing for fifteen minutes and ended up playing for an hour.  I am not a big gamer at all, but this is the best game I have played.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Truly enjoying this style of writing! Love the way each chapter is one character's story! Keeps you on your toes... Martin builds the characters and setting with a lovely choice of words... Sometimes harsh words that reflect the setting and situation. Highly recommend this set!
B00355R3OS|5.0|For a 20 min workout this one is a killer! I love to switch up my workouts with shorter and longer and even though this is a shorter one you get that great worked out feeling in such a short period of time. Imo Jillian has that perfect balance of motivating and encouraging without taking any crap. Also great as it works out numerous muscle groups:) Definitely worth the 2 bucks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game! Entertaining and addictive! Awesome game to play with friends and/or family members. Never a dull or boring moment!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. YouVersion Bible allows you to read differt version of the bible like the King James version and the New King James version. This app also allows you to bookmark important bible verses. It provides a way for me to access my bible on the go. I can use it at appointment, while I am on the go, in class, and meetings.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|After 3 years of having Far on repeat, Regina Spektor came up with a new, and deliciously perfect, album.<br />I am happy to confirm that her writing skills haven't been worn out at all: you can see (actually, hear) this by listening to tracks like Ballad of a Politician, in which she compares their behavour as that one of a prostitute by his unreliable hand-shake. She still plays with her voice in a way nobody does: just listen to Open. And although it may cause you a strange sensation when she does that thing with her throat, it's just the perfect way to paint that feeling of claustrophobia, asphyxiating, and desperation. No lyrics could match that.<br />And musically... flawless. Perfect. The opening song, Small Town Moon, is just one sweet work of art.<br /><br />I have a good feeling Regina Spektor will never disappoint me.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I originally checked it out from the library, and after reading it, I HAD to buy it.<br />What I enjoy most about the book is how personable Ozzy is. Though semi-eccentric, he is really down to earth and easy to relate to, in a weird sort of way. The biography is written exactly as I picture him speaking, and I've laughed, smiled, and cried at multiple times.<br />I'd recommend the book to anyone, not just Ozzy or Black Sabbath fans, because it's a very interesting read.
0345803507|5.0|This was unusual reading material for me but I became spelled bound by the ease of reading and the content.<br />I was on of those useless books that once you start to read you could just not put it down and hated for<br />the book to end.  I was glad I bought the triology.
B00846TTDG|5.0|One of the best military themed movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone; two thumbs way up!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I m going to keep this short. This album is the 20th studio release from one of the most astoundingly creative and powerful trios to ever live. Words can not describe how brilliant the 20th album, Clockwork Angels, is.  It is a 100% gift to the fans from one of the most prolific artists to take the stage. Only Pink Floyd can convey a story more vividly and they have been separated for some time due to creative differences. Do your self a favor. Get the album today, listen to it many times, soak it in, lyrics, concept, music, drums, bass, and guitar.....Go to a show and I dare you to tell me you are not astounded at the delight and brilliance that is and always will be in music history. R - U - S - H!!
0071762345|5.0|Been keeping researching a lot for informative social media books to read in my spare time. Mainly because our university professors know very little about the social media. Dave does a good job of giving practical advice as well as interesting case studies. Definitely worth reading, I learned a lot.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|stop working rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr very good u need to fix this now and i mean now now now now now now
B0002F6BRE|1.0|this is the worst movie ever made.  this is not funny one reason this adult acts like he is a kid.  this man grows up around elf's and he does not get a hint that he is different from them even though they come up to his knee.  the fat guy sends the elf guy to new york to see his dad.  Santa said do not eat the gum on the road but he then eats the gum on the benches.  either this guy trys to hard or not enough to act at all.  will the skill-less actor acts like a baby.  his day brings him to his work and he elf see a small man and he calls him an elf and the short man did not like that and after a while he said say it 1 more time so he did and got beat up by the little man.  see that is how dumb he is.  no humor at all.  worst to ever be made.  if you see this you will see what i mean.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its one of the best games ivhave Everett played. I am almost done and about to complete this game!!
B00004RFFI|5.0|this got to be one of the top greatest natural disaster movies out there and if not on any list well it is on my list.  see the point of the story is there are storm chasers following tornadoes and they also got to have these little thing to get picked up in the storm to tell them the storm from inside out.  that way to give every one more of a warning.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|Horrible App. First of all it is not even close to what I searched. &quot;GPS&quot; is what I had searched and this app only gave me maps. I wouldn't recommend this app, but if you like maps then you should download this app.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well, it has been AGES since I have properly reviewed a book and I am somewhat intimidated to be diving back in with such a behemoth of a story that has already garnered global attention and veneration. However, seeing as though these books served as my renaissance to the reading world (2011 will forever be remembered as the year of the beastly books) I have to throw my hat into the ring of universal praise for what was easily the most spellbinding series I've read in a long time. Now, full disclosure, it took me a while to get over the names of the three main characters (Katniss, Peeta and Gale). Katniss is a mere letter variation of the feline meth I put in my cat's toys, Peeta is a similar variation on an appetizer I order at a Greek restaurant, and Gale is a woman (I'm assuming in Gale's case the author was trying to be crafty and name him after the hurricane-like calamity the Irish like to call a \\"storm\\", but whatever the reason, fail. You named your rough and tough love interest after a woman, Suzanne. That is a fail). But after I moved past the naming debacle and the fact this is a series about post-apocalyptic, youth on youth genocide, I was beyond hooked from start to finish. I read all three books back to back whilst on a Mexican holiday for my 30th birthday, ie, I was half in the bag for most of them and I STILL finished the third book with a cloudy, but strong impression that I had just experienced literary entertainment of the finest quality. Yes, the seemingly endless and increasingly disturbing methods by which this author kills off her characters (most of whom are under the age of 18) is mind boggling and certainly calls into question her qualifications as a parent, but truthfully the story as a whole is good. It is DAMN good. It is everything one could ask for in a series: creative and fast paced story-line, characters with whom you will develop attachment and a significant trace of the lettered heroin few authors have discovered and used to make a book literally impossible to put down. This is one of those series that will have you engaging in awkward behaviors wherein you are reading at inappropriate times and locations (office bathroom, dinner parties, during an intimate one on one conversation with another person that may or may not be crying...you don't judge me). In any case, five stars. Five glowing, magnificent stars. Hunger Games, I love you and readers, I implore you, read these booksbook literally impossible to put down.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I expected this to be a light read and geared toward the young adult audience. I was pleasantly surprised by the maturity and depth of the characters, the compelling story and the provocative parallels to our own corrupt system.<br /><br />I voraciously read all three. Highly recommend.
B007JRU4N0|1.0|I fell asleep about 1/3 of the way through. Story was bad, pacing was poor, characters not engaging nor believable. Not worth my time.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|A couple of days ago I read a review of Ridley Scott's \\"Prometheus\\", and the film critic's biggest complaint appeared to be that he found the film to be very confusing.  First of all, I'd like hear what this critic has to say about one of David Lynch's films; if he was addled by \\"Prometheus\\" then \\"Mulholland Drive\\" must've had him scurrying for the exit.  Because, while there are surely complaints to be made about Scott's nominal \\"Alien\\" prequel, confusing it is not.<br /><br />In the year 2089, while exploring caves in the cliffs on Scotland's Isle of Skye, a pair of archaeologist/lovers (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) discover an ancient \\"star map\\".  Soon enough, they realize that the location of the stars in the image matches up EXACTLY with similar drawings from other ancient cultures.  Four years later, the sinister Weyland Corporation is jetting the pair, along with a complete crew--mostly self-serving and unlikable types--to a distant planet that may be home to humanity's creator(s).  The starship is named Prometheus and its occupants include corporate bigwig, Meredith, an Ice Queen (Charlize Theron) who is too-obviously up to no good (or is she?); Michael Fassbender's David, both devilishly good-looking and just devilish as the corporate android with several agendas; and Janek (Idris Elba) the ship's stalwart captain, who is probably the most sensible one of the bunch.<br /><br />Once on the planet, the explorers find themselves in a series of interconnected caves that turn out not to be caves at all; they also find that they are not alone.  There are several different species of creatures, one, our \\"creators\\", not even indigenous to this particular planet.  There are some spooky scenes, too, although none come close to the claustrophobic terror of Scott's original \\"Alien\\".  When one of the female members of the mission suddenly finds herself (impossibly) pregnant and graphically aborts the \\"fetus\\", it's somehow reminiscent of that dinner table scenein \\"Alien\\" when the creature bursts out of John Hurt's chest.  It's a queasy, disturbing scene that stays with you.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace, so captivating in \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and its sequels, is completely believable as archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw, wearing her conflicting emotions like a Kabuki mask, her shell-shocked victim eventually giving way to Ripley-like heroics.  As her other half, Logan Marshall-Green--looking more like a male fashion model than a seasoned archaeologist (not necessarily a complaint)--is also heroic, yet much more vulnerable than Rapace; when he says he wants to \\"meet his maker\\", he gets more than he bargains for.  Charlize Theron uses her blonde, athletic good looks in the same way that Michael Fassbender uses his--both seem like androids but only one truly has that distinction, and both are dripping with malevolence--but I think that Fassbender gives the better performance.  In fact, considering that he's playing a robot, Fassbender arguably gives the best performance in the film.  The rest of the cast aquit themselves nicely, but some seem like stock characters spouting stock dialogue and doing various stock things until it's time for their characters to get killed off.<br /><br />Above all, the special effects in \\"Prometheus\\" are wondrous; the team who created the ships, and this world with its strange and dangerous beings, are true artists.  The musical score, by Marc Streitenfeld, is portentuous and exciting, and there is a sleek sexiness to the costumes worn by most of the characters that would be equally appropriate for a superhero movie.<br /><br />The movie questions the morality of creating life only to later seek to destroy it, assuming that alien beings would have the same sense of morality as humans.  It also presents searching for our origins in space as an elusive task, at best, one that is pursued at considerable peril, and with an almost certainty of deadly consequences.  Director Ridley Scott asks these questions, answering some and apparently deferring others for a presumed sequel.  At no time during the film are our \\"creators\\" (designated The Engineers) presented as benevolent beings dedicated to anything other than their own shady and violent enterprises.  Scott and his writers seem to be trying to create a new mythology here, and while there is an air of mystery, I'm not sure it's enough to sustain a whole new franchise, much less reboot the ailing \\"Alien\\" franchise.<br /><br />.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book kept me awake reading very late into the night. I'm looking forward to seeing more books from this author. I haven't had this much fun since Pillars of the Earth! Thanks Hugh.
B00846REIS|1.0|This was a huge disappointment after reading Fifty Shades of Grey.  It was so bad I didnt even finish the book. I don't recommend this read.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Didn't have high expectations for a prequel that obviously didn't have Andy involved. (RIP mate.) Boy, was I in for a surprise! Watched it end to end one weekend.  Sure, over the top sex and violence, but c'mon, what's not to love about that! ;)<br /><br />A worthy mini series that has be now chomping at the bit for S2.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love how this works!  Being able to get a sample of the book first is really nice.  And the best part is downloading it to my phone!  I always have my book with me and if I have time, I open it up and start reading!  I highly recommend this!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best version of solitaire I have played! Kudos!<br /> You have got to try this game. Have fun!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I loved this movie! This was the first military related movie my boyfriend, who is a soldier, could watch without saying 'they would never actually do that' the whole time! Very Action packed and keeps you wanting more!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a little slow in the beginning, but overall this book was awesome. The psychological aspects to this book, along with the sense of really getting to know the characters is what makes this a great story. The prose and context of the court scenes was an integral process of understanding the legal system. Knowing that everyone doubts everyone else puts this thriller suspense book on the brink of breathing fresh air into a truly unique tale of \\"whodunit?\\"
B007N0REX6|3.0|Been following Myles, and really liked Alter Bridge. Got this CD for Myles' vocal abilities alone. The mix on the CD seems to separate the instruments to much. The result is a sound that is not quite meshed. Slashes guitar, heavy on the right, seems to come in and say, \\"It's me, Slash, playing here\\", while the rest of the guys just play along. What is also interesting to me is, you can almost guess who wrote each song by the way they start, and how loud Slash is in the mix. Oh, and Myles...stop trying to sound like a chicken...just sayin'<br />Slash.....keep the big names out of your music, your fine just by yourself. Just not jellin with the rest on this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this app after my sister told me how much fun it was on her iPod. I find myself picking it up every time I get bored! It's simple but addicting and challenging. the graphics aren't the best, but hey, it's a free app.
B005K17RU0|4.0|pretty good app. seems to work just fine on my fire.<br />easy to use. good at finding where I am and using that actual local for the forecast.
B0086700CM|2.0|I don't care much for this game and surprised by the reviews. not much else to say. I just don't like it
B003A6X0P8|5.0|this is an awesome sounding cd from an awesome classic band love it. i would recommend this cd to any deep purple fan
B007I2BZIE|5.0|First of all, all the songs are fantastic. Others have written extensively on that. Secondly, the production while \\"loud\\" is very clean sounding and sounds good. I recommend listening to this on a good sound system or high quality headphones.<br /><br />What I found most interesting is that it is heavily inspired by Voltaire's story Candide. This is even mentioned in the liner notes. In Candide, the title character was raised to believe that God was watching out for us all, and that all is for the best. After he realizes this is not true, he doubts his faith and sets out on a quest of self discovery. The story is actually really absurd and hilarious (which is on purpose, as it is satire). Here, that general theme is represented musically with a science fiction twist. I can't wait for the novel to come out, which will be fun to compare to Candide.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The product was excactly what I wanted and it atrrived in a very timely manner in excellent condition.  The descrption of the product being sold was very accurate!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have been using this app for about 2-3 wks.  I really like it & have found it to be invaluable to my business.  I am a tutor & it saves me from going over on my sessions.  If I go over, it's my dime, not theirs - so this has already saved me $$$.<br />The app is simple, clear, easy to use (ALWAYS a +!).  The music (as an alarm) is a plus and can be tailored to my different students (both kids & adults), makes them feel special when I use a sound or music sample from their country, or that they KNOW is especially for them.  Whether the tune is Todo de Fuego, Bach, or Snoop Dogg.<br /><br />Another plus is that the music starts out quietly (as an alarm) & builds in intensity if I ignore it.  OR I can dismiss it entirely.  The thing I love most is that it is eminently customizable, whether I want it to make the noise as alarm for a certain amt of time, fully loud, start quietly and build.  Then again if I want it to dismiss the alarm on a 'shake' of the phone, or any of the other choices...it's great & I wouldn't be without it!<br /><br />I'm happy!
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|FUN, Light Hearted take on  what could be the angst of being a women; an enjoyable read, I would highly recommend this book by Caitlin Moran
B007SGM084|4.0|this book is not written so you can improve your vocabulary, so get over that and dive into a FUN world. It will most certainly keep you entertain and curious SERIOUSLY
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is pretty awesome. I've had it for almost a month and still have to play it every day! It's great for anyone who loves puzzles, crosswords, etc. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but I love it now!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This thing is great for what it is- a toy for adults. It's not a super accurate prop replica, and I don't think it would hold up against being played with by a young child. But, if you want a neat little toy from the show to have sitting in your office, it's for you. I imagine it would also make a good costume accessory to go with a Dr. Who Halloween get up, especially with the light and sound.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game occupies my 6 year old for hours. Works good and haven't had any problems on my Fire. It has a crazy amount of games.
0446572993|4.0|Baldacci weaves a very intricate yarn in his latest book, \\"The Innocent.\\"  After about 100 pages I found my mind's eye seeing protagonist Will Robie as tough-guy actor Jason Statham, and smart 14 year-old Julie Getty as the pre-pubescent McKenzie Phillips in \\"American Graffitti.\\"  Just happened!  Baldacci did an excellent job of fleshing out his main characters and putting them in (mostly) believable situations.  He hit the gas pedal hard in the last 100 pages to ramp up the action - - and the stakes - - to really grab the reader's attention.  Two minor quibbles: he kind of telegraphed a couple important character developments far in advance so I could see them coming from a long way off.  Even so, \\"The Innocent\\" was a great read that I didn't finish until 1:40 a.m., which should also tell you something!
B000JIHP88|5.0|MI NENA LO ADORA, CASI TODAS LAS NOCHES SE DUERME CON LA MUSICA.<br />SUPER RECOMENDABLE, HERMOSO LOS COLORES QUE TIENE, CALIDAD IMPECABLE.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an amazing game! I recommend it to you. This game is very addicting. This is one of those you will put in your faves.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing this on my kindle.  This game is very addicting.  It challenges your mind but allows you to enjoy. If you have not tried you need to.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games keeps you busy. I like the puzzle and ghr dart games the most. free games 101 worth the space on my kindle
1594744769|3.0|I really loved the book as it began. The narrator was wonderful (Jacob cracks me up) and the plot was very interesting and different. But as the story went along, and more characters got introduced.... I began to lose interest.<br />Maybe it was the whole Emma thing that turned me off.<br />However, just be wary of the fact that the book does indeed get boring towards the end. I enjoyed it very much in the beginning, but that faded quickly.
0786891416|5.0|I recommend deeply to all of the fans! And even for thous who aren't watching Castle.. Read Heat Wave! Now! Btw costumer service in great too! Enjoy!
1455510319|4.0|Michael Connelly is a terrific writer, and this is another solid story with one if his defining characters (the Lincoln lawyer). I recommend reading all of his works. Almost everyone one of them is a gripping read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best thing. ever wish I could get points more easy.<br />I love this app soooooooo much wish I could marry it
0066620996|1.0|I hardly ever write book reviews but I felt compelled to write one for this book, especially since its rating is undeservedly so high.<br /><br />This is probably the worst book I own, and surely the most unsatisfying read I've had in a long while. It is thoroughly useless because its method for analysis is 100% unreproducible and thus 100% unscientific - it's entirely subjective.<br /><br />How is anyone supposed to believe that \\"Early in transition, Philip Morris saw that it could become simply the best tobacco company in the world.\\"?? Is there proof of this? More importantly, how does one see when one can become simply the best company in the world?? How does one know if he or she is a \\"fox\\" or a \\"hedgehog\\"?<br /><br />This book is packed with sweeping statements of zero use to anyone with a brain.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is super awesome!!!!!!! I love it there are tons of levels and it is so easy to use!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to be released for the Kindle Fire. I downloaded the app the day it was released! I'm glad to say that the game works great on the device! The gameplay is very addictive and there are loads of stuff to upgrade and unlock! The game lags a bit but that flaw is very minor in my opinion. It's free! It's awesome! It's TEMPLE RUN!!!
1455518999|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was different but interesting.A good book is both entertaining and educational. I have started another book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It took a few chapters to get into 50 Shades, but once you start I couldn't put it down. It's not the best written book I've ever read but the story of Christian Grey is so intriguing. Don't give up on it too early or you will be missing out on an amazing journey!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I belong to a bookclub and I read at least one book every month!  I have read the entire trilogy of Fifty in a week.  Couldn't put it down.  I'm already having withdrawals from Christian and Ana.  Can't wait for E.L.James to give us the next book!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been dieing to have this game on kindle fire, and the only game that was simalar to this game,(which sucked), was cave run 3D. But now that this is on the kindle fire, I am so happy. It totally beats cave run and you should get it right now!  :-)
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very interesting book.  Dr. Davis doesn't leave out any details...very informative.  I didn't realize wheat is so bad for you and how many parts of your body it can affect until now.  I changed from white to wheat when the FDA recommended doing so and now I'm sorry I did.  I'm not quiet finished reading the book but have enjoyed every minute of it so far and recommend it for everyone to read.  You'll be happy you did.
B005GUQIDC|5.0|purchased this for my husband, loves to listen to it in \\"the man cave\\" nice to have a husband who enjoys GOOD music
B0086700CM|5.0|it is cool to play because you can jump and you can turn it is just fun to play love Milan
B0079XNWQA|5.0|heard a (1) hit wonder from this c.d. loved the song and decided to purchase c.d. as I never had heard of this band. This is the ultimate in feel good music, EVERY song a hit. Just ordered another c.d. from band, can't wait!
B0083GCK5G|5.0|I am generally not interested in artists who try to reinvent their careers after 20/30/40 years.  However....the Beach Boys were such a fun part of my youthful years, I just had to have this album.  And I am thrilled with it! Boy oh boy....the memories are pouring forth....
B0063GORYU|5.0|it's just like the computer version. I love it because I don't have to be connected to the Internet to play.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|No plot, 3d not very good and overall it sucked big time. Total waste of money and the time to watch it.
1416585710|3.0|Okay book
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Short and sweet; I stumbled upon John Scalzi about 4 years ago after picking up \\"The Android's Dream\\" and have enjoyed all his novels since. Sure, this is no \\"Old Man's War\\", but it's still a great, engaging, and most importantly, entertaining read. A definite read for any Star Trek fan or science fiction fan in general. Definitely worth your time!
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Wow. This is one of those albums you stumble across and then realize how lucky you are that you have.<br /><br />Chris Robinson from the Black Crowes and an excellent band. It's like going to a show in the mid-70s and finding out members of the Allman Brothers, The Band, the Grateful Dead and the Black Crowes have formed a band and you are getting to check them out before everyone else.<br /><br />The songs are long and luscious. Great playing and singing. A perfect summer disc. Check this out. If you believe in a long, prolonged, derangement of the senses in order to obtain the unknown - this song collection is for you.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|The great beginning. Even my husband, who hasn't read the books, enjoyed the hbo episode. I can't wait to purchase the blue rays.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|I would read Katherine McCarthy's review or Manuel Grosso Galvan's. They say it better than I can. The songs are exquisite as are the arrangements. The playing is magnificent and the recordings make it seem you are there watching the CD unfold.<br /><br />Best songs? Hard to select. Banga, Seneca, Constantine's Dream, Nine, Amerigo and Fuji-san. There isn't a song here that does not shine.<br /><br />The version of \\"After The Gold Rush\\" brought tears to my eyes it is so beautiful. It just doesn't get any better than this.
B005723JSQ|5.0|It was such a fun read!  I was smiling the entire book.  I would actually read this again!!  Loved it!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Haven't finished this book yet.Find it boring and much the same as one and two.More sex,different positions, different places. My sex life is more intriguing.
B005HSL626|1.0|It is fun but after three weeks I could not play fruit ninja<br />just get the paydedone it might work better.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie was so fun and enjoyable! I found myself singing to the songs and very into the movie! Diego and Julianne were so good in this movie!! Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, and Russel Brand were very unforgettable in this movie. The soundtrack is amazing and I need to see it on Broadway pronto!
B0086700CM|5.0|I admit I am addicted!! Works great on the Droid Razr. :-) Excellent graphics, no glitches- only issue is when I swipe, sometimes it doesn't respond (may just be me). All in all a fun game!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. Easy to use. Lots of free puzzles. should have 500 pieces also. $0.99 for additional puzzles are a good deal too.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Beautifully realized with fantastic creatures and wonderful effects. Many details are only noticed with repeat viewings, thankfully this is a movie you can enjoy watching over and over again!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game. but u will need friends you can add me as a friend little4400 you will have hood clean food.

B0086700CM|5.0|the most amazing and fun game I have ever played.  always makes my mood happy.  its a family friendly game that make people stop and watch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little games that are very addictive. the only problem is it take sooo many points to get to the next game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading the first chapter I really believed this book was written by a Jr. High school student.  Besides the appallingly bad writing the plot is completely unrealistic and the main character seems bipolar.  Don't waste your time on this book.  I can NOT believe this book is a best seller!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|In reading the info about the update, the \\"What's new in version 6\\" message lists \\"font package\\" as the first entry. What is the font package? I got a message to download 11 MB of fonts at app opening, but then it directed me to the developer's web site to buy the font package. Where is the update for version 6? Shouldn't this simply be part of the initial download?<br /><br />I bought this 6/11/2012. The version listed is 6.1. Overall, I am happy with being able to create Office docs and edit ones I already have. It is helpful to be able to do this using the Kindle Fire as I travel. Obviously, this is not designed to take the place of a desktop or laptop, but it is a quick app to use for viewing and editing the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.<br /><br />I have not found any mathematical errors in the Excel sheet, as another reviewer listed. Perhaps that was one of the \\"fixed bugs\\" listed in the version 6 updates.<br /><br />I am glad I bought this during a sale since it is only 99 cents right now. For that price, it is a good buy. I would be less annoyed if it did not begin with a request for me to pay $5 for the font package, though. If the new version was updated with fonts, then the fonts should be in the updated app.<br /><br />The files loaded quickly and were easy to edit. They appeared as expected when transfered to a computer. Overall, a good program, but it is missing fonts. If you want to spell-check with the word processor's dictionary, that, too, is an additional charge. So, the in-app requests for additional fees make this a less-than-5-star app.<br /><br />At 99 cents, it is worth the purchase, though, since it does what it states it will do, albeit with fewer than anticipated fonts.
B000L3CHC0|4.0|Great watch for the price.  Still looks better than most watches available in the price range even though 2011 model.  Water proof better than most sport \\"diver\\" watches.  Not oversized but perfect in size and weight for medium seized wrist.  Definitely recommend for casual dress watch.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Attempting to fish playing on Fire seems not to work. The screen becomes unresponsive and the game has no function to end fishing... so you're stuck in game unable to quit fishing mode even upon device reboot.  Flaw almost seems intentional.

B004NSULHM|5.0|The Radiohead sound is really changing through the years and the many great albuns they created...They start as a rock band, but since KID A i really think Radiohead became another creature...Another great creature...From Pablo Honey to OK Computer, what you hear are guitars, bass, drums, vocals and some piano...Since KID A they change it all...in some songs you can´t even hear a normal guitar sound, and they definitelly added some eletronic and weird atmospheres to their songs...It´s another type of sound, but for me IS BRILLIANT...Hearing this one KING OF LIMBS, i clearly remenber the impact of KID A and AMNESIAC...This one KING OF LIMBS is another nice strike from RADIOHEAD...I like all the 8 songs...It´s a nice eletronic rock trip, maybe the best since KID A...Thom Yorke is a SUPERB vocalist...If you like the new RADIOHEAD sound, after 3 or 4 spins, KING OF LIMBS can really be a nice music trip!!!REALLY LIKE IT!!!
1401201911|5.0|Once upon a time there was an infant named Kal-El from the distant planet Krypton. When the planet's red sun was going out, Krypton was on the verge of destruction. In order to save one of their race, Kal-El's parents place him in a little spaceship and send the ship to Earth while everyone else dies with Krypton and it's sun. Kal-El would eventually become Superman, the Man of Steel. And where on Earth does his ship land, not on a small farm in Kansas, but in the heart of communist Russia!<br /><br />If you think that I'm making this up, I am not. In this parallel universe, Superman now fights for the soviets, the expansion of communism, and Joseph Stalin. Eventually after Stalin's death, Superman takes control of the Soviet Union and soon America is the only noncommunist country left on Earth.<br /><br />An entirely original Superman Storyline by Ultimates writer Mark Millar, filled with lots of action and meaningful moments! The best Superman storyline ever since The Death of Superman!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love these books so much.  After so many horrible things happening to so many good characters - I finally had a moment where I actually screamed \\"yes!\\" and pumped my fist.  Wont ruin the story - but it was good to see something good finally happen to a character I love.<br /><br />Cant wait to read the rest of the books.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|End This Depression is an objective, positive yet realistic book about how America (and the rest of the struggling world) can work to end the recession that has lasted since 2008.<br /><br />Krugman is non-partisan, and doesn't hesitate to pull punches where punches are due in discussing political and 'expert' opinion on economics and the recession.<br /><br />Where End This Depression is refreshing is the novel is very much focussed on solving the problem, something which appears to be missing from the publishing environment on this subject (except the typical polemics - which generally propose solutions of vote for the right people and everything will be fixed.)<br /><br />My only criticism (which is perhaps a slight on myself) is that I didn't find End This Depression particularly accessible. In truth I struggle with most economic analysis, and when reading non-fiction I do judge on how well non-experts will follow them. Thats just my response though.<br /><br />Otherwise Krugman is much required reading for any who are sick of the fear-mongering and rhetoric on the economy and are interested in some real solutions.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This guy is the complete package.  Amazing.  His instincts for constructing a song are without flaw.  Although each song has merit on its own, rightfully this album should be enjoyed as a whole.  I wish someone would have told me that before I obsessively repeated \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" on youtube.  What a talent, this Gotye.  And his vocal range?  Makes one's mouth water.<br /><br />True music lovers, don't hesitate to add this album to your collection.  I haven't been this excited about new music since I discovered The Kin in 2007.
B005EVVESM|4.0|Another birthday gift - this one for my daughter.  I didn't like the provocative cover, but the musical content is fantastic.  I was so happy to see my pre-teen pick a \\"non-Disney\\" album she could relate to, and identify it as her favorite.  My little daughter is growing up, listening to healthy music, and not afraid to show her personal tastes.  Maroon rocks!
B0010SKSTO|4.0|It is an interesting read, but the presentation seems a bit dis-joined. Good descriptive dialogue of what to look for  , how to interpret, what to consider, and includes photographs of body poses. I did try observing people and trying to predict their intentions from the pointers in the book and yes the book is correct, but don't expect to be an expert in a few minutes.<br /><br />You notice that if you put into practice what you have read, you begin to observe people in a different way. Feet are now one of my first observations!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|if you get this game please type in paige _ garchow and friend me send me some energy and ill help you out and send you energy.  but BEWARE this game is extremely. adicting I love it and people who says its boring the clearly morons. who didn't read the paragraph about this game
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This book does a substantial job of covering the relationships amongst the presidents from Hoover to Obama.  It is an easy read but offers a lot of facts and seems to have good research behind all of their information. It definitely gave me a new appreciation for the relationships presidents have with each other and their desire to protect and perpetuate the Presidency.  The authors seem to slant a bit left in their analysis; but overall it is good information and offers new insight into the \\"club.\\"
B000NA22C6|5.0|I don't know why I thought it said Spanish subtitles. Probably because it has every other subtitle you could imagine... EXCEPT Spanish! Ahhh! I still love this movie. No regrets about upgrading from DVD.
B0086700CM|5.0|Definately the best game ever. It's really fun and addicting. That is all I have to say on the subject.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time this afternoon.  I have not seen the BBC series.  I read the book probably 5 or 6 years ago, so I am not coming into this with completely \\"fresh\\" eyes.<br /><br />First - this is certainly NOT an \\"action\\" movie in today's traditional sense.  I think if you've read any of the negative reviews, here or elsewhere, you probably know that.  I really do think if you go into this expecting a spy movie in the vein of James Bond or the Bourne movies, you are setting yourself up for instant disappointment.  While that might not be fair to you, if you didn't know what the movie was about, it's also not fair to criticize the movie so harshly just because it didn't meet your idea of what it should've been, based on a genre.<br /><br />Also, people have described it as boring, slow, confusing, etc. etc. etc.  I can't agree with any of those adjectives.  The movie is deliberate - it builds, over the course of the movie.  You don't meet a character and be told - \\"and he's best friends with that guy\\" or \\"and he doesn't like that guy.\\"  You are shown hints and situations that teach you to figure this out for yourself.  You have to pay attention.  You have to learn the character's names.  Since I was busy doing some other things, I put the captions on so I didn't have to have the sound up so loud - that really helped me clarify that quickly, and also helped when the speaker was off camera.  I could easily identify who was speaking and what exactly they said.  I don't intend to \\"talk down\\" to anybody, but honestly, it must be said that this is not a movie to casually watch.  I tried that - and found myself reversing the DVD to catch what had happened.  You need to focus on this movie and pay good attention.<br /><br />I have no intention of giving spoilers or details here - you can look in about a thousand different places to find that information, if you haven't read the book or seen the BBC series.  Suffice it to say this is truly a \\"spy thriller\\" masterpiece - no explosions, not many guns, but intrigue, deceit, double and triple crossings galore, not to mention some really exciting scenes that really did make my pulse race!<br /><br />I do want to mention the superb acting of the entire cast.  I thought each and every one was phenomenal.  Some were (basically) unknown actors to me before - Tom Hardy, for example.  I know he was recently in a rom-com but he should take on more dramatic roles, because he nailed it.  I expected nothing but greatness from Gary Oldman, and got it, along with Colin Firth and Toby Jones.<br /><br />Admittedly, I am a HUGE fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, which is what led me to this movie in the fist place, but I feel that every bit of praise he's received as an actor in this role is well deserved.  His character, Peter Guillam, was one of the more developed in this version, to great effect in my opinion.  I've read quite a bit of dissension on reviews here and elsewhere about the decision to portray Guillam as gay in this version.  I don't think it damaged the story - in fact, I think it made it more clear that Guillam had a LOT to lose and took even bigger risks than other agents would have in doing the same work in helping Smiley.  Although it seems like they all risked an equal amount in risking their lives, Guillam was also risking his legacy and his name.  Had the other agents found out about his lifestyle, not only could he have lost his career and possibly even his life, but also every scrap of their respect.  I find it somewhat funny that people blame this character shift on a \\"political correct Hollywood agenda\\" rather than the fact that homosexuals did exist in this time and were terrified of being \\"outed.\\"  The emotional heft that (again, in my opinion) was added to the role and the risks that Guillam took, and his anger at some of the steps he did take, was brilliantly portrayed.  I believed every single moment of Cumberbatch on screen.  I am truly astounded to see howSherlock Holmes/Dr. Frankenstein/The Creature/Paul Marshall/all the other characters that I've seen him play but can't remember the name of at the moment really BECAME a 1970s spy - without any great change to his appearance (well, the hair) or any hammy over-acting.  Well done to a fantastic actor.

0312611692|5.0|I've just finished reading \\"Why the West Rules for Now - The Patterns of History and What They Reveal About the Future\\" by Ian Morris and I have to say, WHAT A BOOK!! It is an amazing perspective of our world, from the beginnings of humans settling down (around 12,000+BCE) to now, with some powerful thoughts on the future. I love history, so facing a big book like this is no big deal for me, and the best thing about it is the way it's written - Ian has a lovely, informal style, bringing in lots of references to popular culture, as well as humour, which makes it readable for everyone. I think this is very important as many of his contemporaries write too academically - which means it doesn't appeal to a broader readership.<br /><br />Looking at our entire social development, but focusing on four areas of measurement - energy capture per capita, organisation/urbanization, war making capabilities and information technology - Ian traces human social development back to when we first started jacking in the \\"hunter gatherer\\" lifestyle around 12,500BCE. Kicking off in a place known as the Hilly Flanks - later Ancient Mesopotamia, and today mostly modern-day Iran - this is the earliest known evidence where humans settled, got organised, and from there, it all began. There is other evidence, such as pottery making in China in 16,000BCE and wall building in Peru in 11,000BCE, but this is where Ian begins and explains his case. It's a fascinating journey.<br /><br />Social development, as defined by Ian in the book is: \\"the bundle of technological, subsistence, organizational, and cultural accomplishments through which people feed, clothe, house, and reproduce themselves, explain the world around them, resolve disputes within their communities, extend their power at the expense of other communities, and defend themselves against others' attempts to extend power. Social development, we might say, measures a community's ability to get things done, which, in principle, can be compared across time and space.\\"<br /><br />Based on the premise that the world has evolved until today with two cores - East and West - Ian compares social development of both cores, with both progressing in essentially the same way but not always at the same time, with the East sometimes overtaking the West, but it is the West that predominately leads the East, until a short time into the future when the East may again overtake the West - but that depends on the decisions we make today.<br /><br />The book also tracks \\"The Five Horses of The Apocalypse\\" and the impact they had at the times they reared their ugly heads. The five horses are: climate change; famine; state failure; migration; and disease. Sound familiar? Scary stuff indeed, with many of these things being predicted.<br /><br />There are a couple of conclusions Ian focuses on that I took away - some in his words, some in mine:<br />* People - in large groups - are all pretty much the same<br />* We always get the thoughts we need to deal with the time we are in - so for example, the religions humans developed and still follow make sense in the context of this argument, because they met a need at the time they were created, but maybe are not relevant for this new age?<br />* People are essentially lazy, greedy and frightened, looking for easier, more profitable and safer ways to do things - that's a continuing theme throughout the book<br />* We've always had wars and migration, but when you read it in the context of our entire history, war no longer makes sense - in any way! Empires always fail, war costs money and destroy countries' economies, and future wars have such potentially catastrophic consequences that it's time to sort out this aspect of humanity. Our future is about being together as one whole, with one Core, and making it work for everyone or...<br />* We need to let go of the nationalism and hatred tied up in history - especially towards current or former colonial powers. They did what was \\"needed\\" then and the whole world moved forward because of these actions. The reality is, most of the old world countries have had a go at it at some point, and the new world countries are following suit - but for the world to keep growing and prospering, the time to let go of hatred is upon us, or we will be no more. Hard to imagine when we can't even watch international sport without kicking the crap out of each other<br />* Migration is top of the pops for issues within Western countries around the world (as we see too often in the media), but the greatest social developments occurred because of migrations - so perhaps it's time to change this mindset?  The reality is we need to. According to Ian, it is expected that 200 million \\"Climate Migrants\\" will be on the road by 2050 (five times as many as the world's refugee population in 2008) and that means there's going to be a lot of thirsty and hungry people needing help. Are we already getting organised to deal with this? But then, we don't exactly have a great track record of helping those starving... The threat of war around this issue is frightening as well...<br /><br />And then we go into the future, and reading the worst case scenario is not easy on the mind. He doesn't leave us without hope though, and that's why I think this book is REALLY important. According to Ian we are facing two scenarios - singularity and nightfall.<br /><br />My take - singularity is us all coming together, we are one Core, and we all work to make the world work for everyone. We are more efficient at capturing energy and using less per capita, because if we keep increasing at the rate we're going, we're going to destroy our world anyway. The way we organize our world needs to be done on a global scale, with effective global governance of some description (something I don't have too much faith in right now with the EU imploding), but this will be an important part of our future. Our war making capabilities will not go away, but as we have the ability to destroy our world 50 times over with nukes, we obviously need to get that aspect under control - state failure and rogue states is another massive threat as far as this is concerned. Then we have the fourth aspect - information technology - but who knows where that is going? We're hardly even aware of many of the advances happening behind closed doors, but then again, what we do know is mind boggling enough. Making sure these advances are to the betterment of humanity is what is important now.<br /><br />Or we have nightfall, the complete destruction of our world as we know it, where humans may or may not survive. If we survive, we'll enter a dark age, but eventually we'll come out of it and head back onto the same path, with either the West or the East harnessing the power of energy as they did in Britain in the Industrial revolution 200 years ago, and we'll reach the same level of development we're at today and perhaps again face the same issues moving forward? If we don't get it right this time, maybe our ancestors 400-500 years down the track will?<br /><br />I hope humanity has the wisdom to ensure we take the path to singularity, but it's hard to believe sometimes. It feels like we're on the cusp, and hopefully we're entering a third axial age with new thoughts for new times?<br /><br />I loved this book and there's so much more I could say, but I do believe it's a must read for as many of us as possible. I think it's a very VERY important book, which really crystallizes things from a very big perspective.needed\\" then and the whole world moved forward because of these actions.

B0086700CM|5.0|how wouldn't love this game. The monkeys are so funny. And ot is so great to have it on the kindle fire. Thank You app store. You stooped my boredom!!!!:)
B005LAIGJQ|4.0|This was not your typical Eddie Murphy movie. It was funny but had a serious note to it about appreciating life and the power of words. This movie did not have enough romance to build the relationship between the husband and wife but it showed how the man got wrapped up in his work and using words to deceive and get whatever he wanted. It was funny for the first half but not one the kids would really enjoy like some of his other movies. There was no nudity but there was some strong profanity and some violence. Not a movie to watch over and over but worth a viewing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible app! I really enjoy the daily devotions it offers with daily reminders.  The Bible studies are great also. it also offers other versions of the Bible like NIV, KING JAMES, the Message bible,  etc. which helps with studing.  I love how you can look up a scripture and take notes and highlight what you are reading.<br />I really, really, love this app.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is such a sweet movie, very short and the soundtrack is wonderful.. It is a holiday favorite for me.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|\\"Suits\\" is great viewing and the pilot will have you hooked from the outset. It has not aired out here in New Zealand yet but I first saw the pilot on a Singapore Airlines flight earlier this year and had to see the rest of the series hence why this was my first purchase using Amazon and will probably not be my last.<br /><br />The combination of wry humour, great acting from fresh faces and quick witted dialogue ensure this series is going to enjoy longevity and I'm really looking forward to purchasing the second series.
0805047905|5.0|This book is one of the best childrens books ever.  A true classic.  Simple, predictable, easy to read and understand and gives the young reader an opportunity to feel confident and successful as a beginning reader.  Love.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I heard this book being talked about on a local radio station. Thought it sounded interesting. I certainly dont mind a sexy book. Not bad. A bit cliche S&M. But enjoyably sexy. I haven't rushed out to get the next one.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|When I first played the app, it was easy to learn. The puzzles get progressively harder. One mistake will carry through for a while and adds to the challenge. It's very fun to see the random dots and lines turn in to a figure! Definitely a worthwhile time-waster!
B004J4WKDI|5.0|Every page of this book is a feast for the reader. You can smell the atmosphere and taste the concoctions. This is the best book I have in more than a year. I love magick and the author handles this with elegance and sophistication. I look forward to her next book. I say Bravo !
B005KR6NS6|5.0|This movie is simply great! It has everything going for it: story, photography, music, locales, acting, choreography, a nice balance between color and black and white...I could go on and on and on... The dvd plays right thru, no menus or set-up options. The copy I got plays fine on my region 1/A Bluray player.If you like dance flix, especially Tango (check out \\"Tango\\" by Carlos Saura) then you will not be disappointed.

B0019IB26I|5.0|Shipped in a few days and was in perfect condition.  Would recommend this CD to any Mayer fan as well as having in your atmosphere.  Mayer is entertaining for concerts and the extended songs are great.
B007L96SI6|4.0|Anyone expecting Haley's d&eacute;but to be some sort of Etta James-meets-Diana Krall affair will undoubtedly be disappointed, as there is no blues or jazz content here.  But taken on its own terms, this is an enjoyable pop album with a strong retro-soul influence (Motown in particular).<br /><br />That Haley co-wrote 13 of the 14 songs (the &#34;deluxe&#34; CD includes four additional tracks) is certainly impressive, although what we have here is a young, potential five-star artist saddled with a lot of three-star production.  This is symptomatic of her too-close association with &#34;American Idol&#34; and Jimmy Iovine/Interscope.  The harsher evaluations here have a point when they single out the general overproduction problem.  This tends to distance the vocalist from the listener unnecessarily, as Haley's voice at times gets buried in the programming mix.<br /><br />Exceptionally, the hyped-up production works very well on &#34;Now That You're Here,&#34; which may be the catchiest soul-inflected dance-pop groover since Kylie Minogue's &#34;Can't Get You Out of My Head&#34; ten years ago.  Listen closely to the second verse and the line &#34;You're like poetry, desire justified,&#34; and you'll hear the phrasing of a superb young singer who is standing sultrily on her own ground.<br /><br />The only inexcusable misstep on this album (for which I blame the producer and not Haley) occurs in the opening track, &#34;Oh My!&#34;  It gets off to a flying start with Haley's &#34;Jamesetta&#34; Brown soul scream, which is perfect; but then, midway through, it is marred by an obviously pasted-in rap cameo by B.o.B.  This is as about as trite as it gets these days, adding nothing but a bit of abject commercialism in the form of mind-numbingly useless filler.<br /><br />Besides the aforementioned &#34;Now That You're Here,&#34; particularly strong tracks include &#34;Wasted Tears,&#34; &#34;Wonderland,&#34; &#34;Walking on Heaven,&#34; &#34;What You Don't Know&#34; (a wealth of &#34;W&#34; titles!) and &#34;Hit the Ground Runnin'.&#34;<br /><br />In summary, this is a fun d&eacute;but album by a creative and free-spirited young woman with boundless energy and talent (and a natural, one-of-a-kind smoky vocal tone).  Here's hoping she will eventually find her way to a more organic label that will help bring out her full artistic potential.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I cannot understand why this movie had such a poor initial reception; it's terrific!  Follows the book<br />fairly closely.  Special effects are top notch.  I would recommend John Carter to anyone.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|Bought this CD, have listened to all the songs, and really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Kelly Clarkson's music.
0345803485|1.0|I've heard people go on and on about this book. I got to read a few chapters free as I am a Kindle owner. That's a half hour I'll never get back!<br />The woman, I can't bear to call her an author, writes like a tenth-grader. She uses words inappropritely and repeats and repeats herself. I wanted to scream at the number of times she mentioned how \\"handsome\\" the main character was. He, and his long index finger that kept touching his upper lip! Please! She sounds like a middle-school kid, I take back the \\"tenth-grader\\" remark, with her first crush.<br />It goes to show just how ignorant most people are. And this crap goes on for two more books? Unbelievable.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter caught me by surprise. I totally missed it at the theaters, never even heard of it before several of my neighbors started raving about how much they liked it. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it: this is a lesson in how CGI can enhance good story telling without overwhelming it. The plot is fairly simple, even a bit old-fashioned, but it is also pure fun to watch.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I managed to grab this book while it was free some time ago.<br /><br />I suggest reading it not only when you want to publish yourself but also when you are regular reader. It really sheds some light on industry as a whole.<br /><br />If you are thinking about publishing your work as a e-book, it is real must-read! Author knows what he is writing about and what is more, he seems to be 100% honest. Actually, what is funny, this book being available for some time for free is example of promotional activities covered by the author in this very book.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book.
0765316994|4.0|Like most Scalzi books, Redshirts is a breezy read, so I was easily able to finish it in just a few hours.  Other Scalzi hallmarks, great dialog and snappy repartee, were also present throughout and had me laughing out loud in many places. The first few chapters seemed a bit slow, the situations awkward, and the science questionable, but my faith in this inimitable author was rewarded as I got into the middle section and an explanation for all of that presented itself . . . or at least the characters thought they had found an explanation. The reader, clued in via meta-meta-meta winks and sleights of hand, is in a better position than the characters to judge what is really going on, despite all the knotty plot twists, time travel, and alternate universes, but not by much.  Readers who are able to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy the ride will be rewarded by a really surprising ending that adds a welcome dose of gravitas and soul to what otherwise could have been a mere romp in nerd paradise.<br />John Scalzi was at my local independent bookstore just days after this book was released, and I was present when he took some time to visit with a small scifi book club at the store prior to addressing a larger crowd.  Although one or two in the group contended it was not \\"scifi\\" enough for them, most of the folks in the club liked the book and would highly recommend it.  Interestingly for a scifi book club, several individuals professed to have very limited knowledge of Star Trek, yet still said they had found the book accessible and enjoyable.  Scalzi said he tries to write so that anyone can appreciate his books, not just geeks.  One person asked Scalzi if he had found it difficult to keep the different time frames and universes straight.  To my surprise, Scalzi said he did not do anything special, just kept it all in his head and kept on writing. He said his writing method could be called \\"fractal drafting\\" in which he writes some, goes back a bit, revises, goes forward, goes back, revises, keeps writing, and so on until the book is done.  He told the group the three \\"codas\\" at the end--which were loved by some in the group (myself included) but not by others--were not something he had originally thought about including in the book, but once he got to the end, he sort of felt the characters needed to say something from their points of view.  He appended those three short stories at the last minute, giving his editor a four-for-one.  I, for one, am very glad he did.<br /><br />Post Script:  I read this book just days after finishing \\"How to live safely in a science fictional universe\\" and couldn't help but notice there were many synergies between them.  This book felt like the manifestation of the \\"narrative\\" that Yu alludes to, yet never fully describes, in his novel (which was FANTASTIC)<br /><br />Post Post Script: The audio book is read by Wil Wheaton, and although I have already read the book, I think I may have to download it and listen to it because the karmic nature of Wesley Crusher reading a book called Redshirts is just too great to miss.<br /><br />Post Post Post Script\\"  Scalzi was great in person. I highly recommend you see him if he is every in your city.  One of the things he talked about last night was his short story \\"Shadow War of the Night Dragons: Book One- The Dead City.\\"  He wrote this as an April Fool's joke, after some website (?) declared these were the most-frequently-used words in the titles of fantasy novels.  To his (and his publisher's) surprise, the story has now been nominated for a Hugo.  On Scalzi's website there is a video of a guy reading this story--possibly one of the best videos I have seen all year.  Takes about 14 minutes but is well worth it.  Listen to the end.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the characters, and unlike most of today's popular romance writers, Sylvia Day can write great fiction.  She writes excellent descriptive prose, and her character development is unparalled. Like I said, it could be a great book if the sex scenes were not so explicit. True, there is sex in good literature, but not the way this is written--way too much detail.  Leave something to the imagination. That's why I only gave it four stars, but otherwise, it's a great read.

B001E45XT4|4.0|Though, at the beginning, it seems to have way too much treble and be a bit too tight on your head, this headset turns out to be very good for the price. The quality of the microphone is surprisingly good compared to various other headsets with double the price. Though the sound quality seems semi-lacking at the beginning, you quickly get used to it and immersed in its comfortable design while still having the ability to hear anything important going on around you. That may be a setback as well as the fact that people around you can hear what you're listening to. But overall, for its cheap price and comfortable design, if you don't have around $50 to get a nice surround sound headset, this is a very good headset to buy.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Using \\"God\\" in the title of the first studio release by the Beach Boys in over two decades does not make it \\"God Only Knows,\\" yet one can almost Smile at the subliminal implication, be it intentional or not. It's hard not to imagine the worst after surviving band members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and Dave Marks decide to reunite and record new material just in time (all right maybe a wee bit late) to celebrate their 50th anniversary. The result however, is a surprisingly credible continuation of days long thought, long gone.<br />That's Why God Made the Radio marks The Beach Boys 29th full length studio recording. From the opening vocals of Think About the Days, there is no question that Brian Wilson is seated comfortably in the Driver's seat. Beautifully melancholy, this 90 second introduction showcases the band's relatively unhindered vocal prowess accompanied only by piano. Unfortunately, the title track and alleged radio single immediately follows. Still impressive in the vocal department, That's Why God Made the Radio is comically cliché. Recalling the days of \\"tuning in the latest star from the dashboard of my car,\\" it unjustly feels as if America's Band have become little more than a sad caricature of what once was.<br />\\"The good times never have to end, and now's the time to let them happen again\\", Mike Love sings on Isn't it Time, a bouncy tune that would have fit seamlessly on an 80's era Beach Boys release. It's clearly evident that the lead singer's agenda in pursuing surf, sun and Fun, Fun, Fun remains hopelessly intact, especially on Spring Vacation. Mr. Love is in great voice here, co-writing a tongue in cheek cut that laudably pokes fun at just how we got here:<br /><br />\\"Some said it wouldn't last.<br />All we can say is we're havin' a blast...<br />Easy money, ain't life funny<br />Hey, what's it to ya?\\"<br /><br />The cut itself is non-offensive with its laid back adult contemporary feel, but by this point in an albumthat spans only 39 minutes, the hoped for magic is beginning to wane, taking on an even more tribute band feel.<br /> The Private Life of Bill and Sue is simply as ridiculous as its title implies. This one likely remained in the can during Brian Wilson's Imagination sessions in the mid 90's when reality television was still a hot commodity. Pseudo Margaritaville fodder, it's nothing more than reality show Kokomo.<br />Shelter is another unremarkable middle of the road ballad likely culled from the very same sessions, as co-writing credit goes to Imagination producer Joe Thomas, who collaborated on 11 of the 12 new tunes.<br />Just about the time you're getting ready to consider throwing in the towel, something wonderful transpires. Mike Love's Daybreak Over the Ocean is simply stunning. Originally considered for his unreleased 2nd solo album in 2005, this track captures the true essence of the original Beach Boys sound so perfectly that it could conceivably have found a home on 1965's Today.  A perfect complement, the Wilson/Love (and Thomas) penned Beaches in Mind is a solid modern day summertime anthem.<br /><br />\\"Southbay surfin' again.<br />Haven't been this way in I don't know when<br />If I have my say, we'll be back again<br />Where the good times never end\\"<br /><br />How this cut was not chosen to be the single, especially considering the time of year at which this disc was released will forever remain a mystery.<br /> The album takes a decidedly more poignant turn with Strange World, as Wilson's more reflective side takes over. It's a drastic change, similar to the monumental leap taken decades earlier from 1965's Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!) to the revered Pet Sounds in '66. Strange World even comes complete with a bicycle bell, quite possibly a second subliminal implication to another introspective tune from that long ago classic LP.<br /> From There to Back Again is unquestionably, the finest moment here and begins a suite of three songs that brings the album to its foregone conclusion. \\"Sunlight's fading and there's not much left to say,\\" Wilson mournfully laments on Pacific Coast Highway, a cut that begins with an A cappella intro almost eerily similar to Our Prayer from the legendary Smile sessions, a feeling that carries on to Radio's swan song, Summer's Gone. Beginning with the lonely tinkling of wind chimes and a haunting piano that subliminally (hmm) echoes the renowned riff of Wilson's old nemesis, Heroes and Villains, there is no question that the final message here signifies far more than its title implies.<br /><br />\\"Summer's gone.<br />I'm gonna sit and watch the waves.<br />We laugh, we cry<br />We live then die<br />And dream about our yesterday.\\"<br /><br /> Seemingly inspired, Brian Wilson has finally found closure here. Whether the band follows his lead or decides to continue further is anybody's guess. Ultimately, the Beach Boys have delivered with minimal disappointment. Should this prove the final bow, they have departed on an admirable note, leaving in their wake nothing less than Good Vibrations.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|By definition, an avatar is a descendant who is a modified reincarnation of an earlier ancestor.  The definition really doesn't apply to the characters in Avatar who assume alien form to survive in a hostile planetary environment; they're more like participants in a virtual reality environment.  Rather, the definition applies to the movie \\"Avatar\\" as a whole.  As I saw it, \\"Avatar\\" is an avatar, in a way, of Star Wars.  While \\"Star Wars\\" took the framework and concepts of King Arthur and Camelot and placed it in space, \\"Avatar\\" took the framework and concepts of cowboys and mystical Native Americans and placed it in space.<br /><br />  Therefore, you have, as I believe Boston Herald critic James Verniere put it, \\"Dances with Giant Blue Ewoks\\", which is a rather comprehensive description.  The only tweak is that instead of traditional cowboys, we have the traditional bullheaded military/industrial complex obsessed with conquest and pillage. So, as a majority of the posters here have sagaciously observed, originality is not \\"Avatar\\"'s strong suit.  But then again, was \\"Star Wars\\" original?  The only original movie is arguably the first one ever made, and even it had to borrow from oral and written folklore and stories.<br /><br />  Okay, enough digression.  \\"Avatar\\" is certainly derivative, but is it any good?  It's astonishingly very good I think, because James Cameron is not only a master of technology, but also good storytelling.  As you felt for Luke as he journeyed toward adulthood and his Jedi destiny, you will feel for quadriplegic Jake as he gropes his way forward towards physical independence, love, and defense of a higher spiritual good.  Sure, you've seen these morality tales before, but seldom with such impeccable CGI (and 3D) depictions, intense characterizations of both human and the alien Na'vi, unrelenting adventure and violence, and compelling spirituality (\\"God does not take sides, but preserves the universal balance\\").  \\"Star Wars\\" had these elements, and of course soared to popular and critical acclaim.  \\"Avatar\\", \\"Star Wars\\"'s avatar, of course duplicated this feat, even more so.<br /><br />P.S.:  Pandora strongly reminded me of a planet you would find in the \\"Star Wars\\" mythos.  Wishful thinking, of course, since they are separated by immense time periods, but I would find a \\"Star Wars\\"/\\"Avatar\\" crossover interesting.s, and of course soared to popular and critical acclaim.  \\"Avatar\\", \\"Star Wars\\"'s avatar, of course duplicated this feat, even more so.<br /><br />P.S.:  Pandora strongly reminded me of a planet you would find in the \\"Star Wars\\" mythos.

0451232577|4.0|Fall of Giants is the first book in the 'Century' trilogy. The story covers the tumultuous period, between the years 1914 - 1924. The story centres around a large cast of characters, located in Britain, Germany, Russia and the U.S.A. The characters come from all walks of life, rich and poor. All events of the time are covered, such as World War I, votes for women, and the Russian Revolution, to name a few.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book an enjoyable read, but with such a large cast of characters, none of them can be fully 'fleshed' out. Having said that I don't know which characters could be left out! I feel this book is not quite as good as the Pillars Of The Earth, or World Without End, also by this author, but I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
030758836X|2.0|While reading the first half of this book, I felt exactly like I was being pulled slowly uphill, click by click, on an old-school, wooden rollercoaster.  The writing is very skillful and the alternating narrator's voices in each chapter works extremely well to keep the reader climbing uphill.  I will fully admit to getting this book on a Friday and sitting outside by the pool all day Saturday reading it, getting a moderate sunburn, to boot.  I couldn't put the book down.  I felt the apex at the top of the rollercoaster hill coming.  Then came the plunge -- the second part of the book when the true villian is revealed and all the various plot twists and turns come to light.  For me, this part of the ride was not nearly as satisfying as the uphill climb.  Quite frankly and as some other reviewers have noted, what started out as a realistic, believable concept went awry.  So many fantastical things started happening and so many horrible character flaws were revealed, that I lost my ability to root for or conversely, hate anyone.  I don't expect every book I read to conclude by tying up all the loose ends with the appropriate people being justly punished -- as a matter of fact, I often prefer that doesn't happen because it's not often realistic.  I'm also comfortable with endings that are open to interpretation.  But this ending?  No spoilers here, but let's say I was completely speechless at the utterly ridiculous ending.  I kept turning the page hoping against all hope that there was at least one more page, one more chapter that would make sense.  So instead of a nice, smooth trip into the station at the end of the rollercoaster ride, I felt like my car jumped the track and I was left somewhere on the side of the road trying to figure out what happened.  I loved the very idea of this book, I loved the writing and I loved the first half -- but after that, I felt almost duped and disappointed and that the author simply ran out of gas.  At least I got a nice tan this weekend.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Ok, I rented the movie and watched it online.  I was very disappointed that this movie was so poorly directed.  I couldn't help but note the following discrepancies on the Director's part; 1. Doesn't know anything about guns, whatsoever 2. Don't have any idea what the North Slope of Alaska looks like 3. Don't have a clue about wolf behavior 4. Don't have a clue about what Alaska looks like (the part of Alaska that they were supposedly in)5. Sadly, like most people think all Alaskan's live in igloo's and it is cold all the time. 6.Have no concept of how long a flight from the North Slope to Anchorage would take 7. The depiction of how much daylight there would be with the weather was not accurate.  I will explain all of these further<br /><br />First of all the ignorance about guns. I howled with laughter when I saw Liam Neeson shoot a wolf that was running at full speed with a scoped rifle.  It is hard to hit a wolf running with a rifle in the first place, or any other animal for that matter that is moving at high speeds.  Hitting it on the run with a scoped rifle is near impossible, but not impossible-you can always get lucky I guess.  The director also needs to pay attention to what kind of ammunition a rifle takes, and what kind of ammunition a shotgun takes. Obviously, you can't fire a shotgun shell in a rifle or rifle ammunition in a shotgun.  Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I saw Liam dig out 12 gauge shells and make like they were for his rifle. One more thing.  Do not, I repeat, do not try to do what they were doing with shotgun shells, ie making thunder sticks, lol.  You will get hurt extremely bad, I can almost guarantee it.<br /><br />The director has absolutely no clue what the North Slope of Alaska looks like, where the Oil fields are.  The North Slope is for the most part flat as a pancake and the tundra turns into gigantic pools of mosquito infested swampy habitat in the summer.  Summer? In Alaska?  I will get to that later for the peoplewho are reading this and are that ignorant. If you have seen the arctic national wildlife refuge films which show caribou running through pristine mountain ranges....well, you guessed it, not accurate.  Anwar is also flat as a pancake.  It is always disputed whether to allow the big evil oil companies to drill for oil there or not.  The area was basically stolen by Jimmy Carter from the Alaskan people in one weekend during his presidency, and made a Federal preserve.  There is only about 70 people who live in ANWR on the coast, and all of them want to drill baby drill.  I agree, it is absolutely mentally challenged to not develope the resources there because of the potential environmental impact.  Of course the Natives are so greedy, I don't know if it would be cost effective to drill there anyway.  They are the big reason why it is so expensive up on the slope.  Anyway, the slope is flat as a pancake.<br /><br />As for wolf behavior.....There has only been one case of a wolf attacking a human in North America.  It was a little boy who was bit on the butt by a young wolf.  The wolf was thought to have rabies, and was destroyed.  Turns out the wolf did not have rabies, and it was unclear why the boy was bitten.  This occurred in Alaska a few years back.  Anyway, they don't attack humans the way the movie depicted.  Back in the dark ages in Europe, there were many wolf attacks resulting in thousands of human deaths.  This was a learned behavior, and once they realized humans were easy picking, it was on.  Their normal food sources were seriously dwindled down to almost nothing also, which resulted in them attacking humans in Europe.  In Alaska there are way to many wolves. Every attempt to thin the numbers by the state of Alaska is met with severe resistance by tree huggers from the lower 48, who most don't know their butt from a hole in the ground, let alone managing wildlife. I am for shooting them from airplanes or even poisoning them.  You would have to realize how the moose and caribou herds have dwindled down because of wolf over population.  Anyway, the director who directed this movie has no clue about wolf behavior.<br /><br />Alaska has seven mountain ranges, and the mountain ranges that they would have crashed into in the movie, looks absolutely nothing like it did in the movie, lol. The biggest discrepancy was how big the trees were. It could have been filmed in the Kenai Peninsula, but looked like Washington or Oregon maybe.  The fella dying of altitude sickness, totally made me laugh out loud. Anywhere there is a lack of oxygen is going to be above the tree line.  In the lower 48, which is what Alaskans affectionately call the part of the United States below Canada, the tree line is about 11,000 feet give or take some. In Alaska, the tree line is only about 3000 feet.  The man would never have died from altitude sickness at the altitude they were in the movie. lol  Man, this director was either a total idiot, or just thinks most people are.<br /><br />On the plane before the crash, everybody is asleep at one point.  Although Alaska is two and a half times the size of Texas, the flight from the slope to Anchorage takes roughly one hour and forty minutes, so the likelihood of everybody sleeping is slim to none.  Heck, they wouldn't even have time to serve drinks hardly!<br /><br />As for all the people who are so ignorant that they think all Alaskans live in snow bound conditions year round and in igloos.  It gets hotter than hades in parts of Alaska in the summer.  Mainly on the slope and interior, not on the South coastal areas though.  Temperatures in Fairbanks get over a hundred degrees in the Summer.  It has something to do with the 24 hours of daylight this time of year.  That brings me to my next topic, I don't think the amount of daylight depicted in the movie matches the weather in the movie.  I mean, it would not be that cold up there with that much snow, if they had that much daylight.  If it is that coldand snowing, there would almost be total darkness.  Once again poor directing without enough research.<br /><br />The above where just some of the obvious discrepancies with the movie.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it really pains me to see how ignorant some people are about the 49th state. When I watch a movie I always look for accuracy, I just can't help myself.  Liam Neeson is a great actor, and I always like movies with him.  I can't really remember a bad one with him in it.<br /><br />One final note, how did I miss this?  The North Slope oil producing areas are all dry, meaning absolutely no alcohol.  If you are caught bringing it into the work or sleep areas, you will be fired, no questions asked.  Believe it or not people can't go two weeks without a drink.  That is what they work two weeks on two weeks off-12 hour shifts. NO ALCOHOL! Poor research on the director/writers part.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Born And Raised is the fifth studio album from Pop Rock singer John Mayer. Mayer is currently one of the best acoustic singers due to his melodic vocals and how well they combine with his guitar playing. With this album Mayer moves away from the sounds heard on Continuum and Battle Studies for a more folk and country sounding album like the sound which can be heard on his first two albums. The album incorporates many genres between pop, folk, country, blues and rock while keeping the signature John Mayer sound which results in an album filled with soothing and mellow songs. Born And Raised does not really fit into just one genre, but instead has influences from many different genres which creates a unique sound.<br /><br />The theme of the record is Mayer's thoughts on growing up and maturing and the wonderful struggle that takes place for both to occur. Mayer has faced many struggles with the media and this album is mostly about his reflecting on how he has now matured and learnt from the mistakes from his past. This is most shown in songs like Shadow Days where Mayer sings in the chorus \\"Hard times have helped me see. I'm a good man with a good heart had a tough time got a rough start, but I finally learned to let it go... my shadow days are over now.\\" The album is the most personal and from the heart album which he has released to date in my opinion as he responds to his past troubles and how he has now changed in many of the songs.<br /><br />Unlike most of Mayer's previous albums, this one does not feature many ballads and sounds unique when compared to his earlier releases. Born And Raised like his previous releases showcases the vocals and songwriting ability of Mayer combined well with different instruments used throughout the album. The album is consistent throughout and is a great new album from Mayer which gets 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Listen to the entire album and download individual tracks from the album below.<br /><br />Top Tracks: Shadow Days, SpeakFor Me, The Age Of Worry, Queen Of California, Something Like Olivia, Born And Raised
B001T4WZ04|1.0|I don't like leaving one star reviews. I always try to focus on the positives. The only positive was the star of the movie was hot. Hot woman in a mini-skirt with a samurai sword - PRO! I love japanese movies, I love samurai movies, I love scary movies, I love gory movies and this ticked all the right boxes when I was looking for a movie to buy. This was a low budget movie. It was gore for gore sake. I don't mind gore. Check out gantz, really gory, but awesome movie. This was pointless gore. The story got really silly. It was just a case of what weird and twisted things can we do? I knew the movie would be like this from the reviews, but I expected plot and awesome action. The fight scenes were rubbish. There is nothing good to say about the movie, the star was hot! I think there are much better movies out there to spend your money on.
B0083GCK5G|3.0|Thatfs Why God Made The Radio is the 29th album from the legendary pop rock group, The Beach Boys. The album was created as a reunion album for the 50th anniversary of the group and is the first album with new material from the group in 16 years. With this new album the group makes a welcome return to the summer fun songs and great harmonizing which hasnft been seen on an album from the group since the 70s.<br /><br />With this reunion album from The Beach Boys, the group showcases the incredible harmonies and easygoing celebration of good times which made the group iconic in the first place. The album opens with a wordless opening which blends the harmonies of the group smoothly together and sets the tone for the rest of the album. Songs like Thatfs Why God Made The Radio, Isnft It Time, Beaches In Mind, Strange World and From There To Back Again bring you back to the classic songs from The Beach Boys and are all some of the top tracks to be found on the album. The album is slower paced than past classic Beach Boys albums, but manages to combine the iconic harmonies of the group smoothly together with songs reminiscing about the past and good times. The Private Life Of Bill And Sue showcases the vocals of the group who still seems to have it even 50 years after the group first began. Along with the release of the album The Beach Boys are having a world tour to go along with the release of the album so if you want to see the group live go look for tickets since it just may be the last tour that the group ever does.<br /><br />Thatfs Why God Made The Radio isnft fast paced like The Beach Boys hit albums from the 60s, but is still one of the best albums from the group in quite some time. The album is consistent throughout in showcasing the harmonizing vocals of the group and does not have one track on the album which I disliked. The album sounds more like the rightful closing album for this legendary group which would be a good note for the band to go off towards thesunset with and gets 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Top Tracks: Beaches In Mind, Thatfs Why God Made The Radio, Isnft It Time, Strange World, Daybreak Over The Ocean, From There To Back Again

B0079XNWQA|4.0|\\"Love Is A Four Letter Word\\" is the fourth studio album to be released from pop artist Jason Mraz. With his fourth album Jason Mraz takes a much more mellow tone with the majority of the songs on the album while trying to put out a positive message in his music. In this album Mraz attempts to put out the message that bad times must occur in order for the good times to be appreciated and that you are truly alive when you love life. Throughout the album Mraz shows off his vocal range and his ability to create colorful inviting melodies. Although Mraz has somewhat changed his sound in this album, his signature songwriting style and emotional performances are still present. The songs Living In The Moment, I Won't Give Up, The Woman I Love, The Freedom Song, 5/6 and 93 Million Miles are the stand out tracks from the album. Overall the album is solid throughout without a bad track to be found.  With Love Is A Four Letter Word Mraz has created a very soothing and mellow album which I give 4/5 stars.
B007Q476KU|1.0|This movie is almost unwatchable. It's like Saving Private Ryan crashed into Black Beauty and all the good parts were destroyed.<br />The first act seems to be written for 4 year olds. The script is so sickly sweet it gave me a headache and Director Steven Spielberg seems to have pulled the characters fro the book \\"Cliche English characters for dummies\\". Once the story moved onto the battlefield the movie makers seemed to give up on the dialogue altogether and we got endless beauty/heroic shots of the horse and main character. This part seems to have been produced with the sole object of making 9 year old girls cry. I can't review the end of the movie because with less than 20 minutes to go I gave up and stopped watching. This shouldn't matter really, because even though I'm a fan of some of Spielbergs' work he very rarely knows how to end his movies.<br />Even worse than War of the Worlds. Don't waste your money.
B007HO392S|4.0|Blown Away is the fourth studio album from country pop singer Carrie Underwood. With her fourth album the progress which she has made as an artist and songwriter since her early albums and American Idol days is evident more than ever.  The album opens with three extremely pop country songs one of which is the opening track Good Girl which is already a top ten single for the five time Grammy award winner. While the first three songs carry a somewhat darker tone, the songs become more lighthearted as the album goes on.<br /><br />Blown Away showcases Carrie's dynamic range and songwriting abilities as well as her ability to create an album which is a good mixture of both pop and country. As usual for Underwood most of the pop songs found on the album carry a darker tone while her country songs carry a lighthearted tone. Songs One Way Ticket, Blown Away and Good Girl are the strongest songs on the album and showcase Carrie's vocal ability.<br /><br />The album starts off extremely strong, but drops down slightly in quality for the second half of the album with the exception being Leave Love Alone. While I enjoy the pop influenced songs from this album most, even though I am not a big country music fan I still enjoyed the country songs found on the album. If you are a Carrie Underwood fan or even somewhat like country music then this album is a must listen which you should enjoy. With her powerful voice Carrie creates a successful heavily pop influenced country album which gets 4 stars. Check out some of the album below and leave your thoughts on the album.<br /><br />Key Tracks: Good Girl, Blown Away, Two Black Cadillacs, One Way Ticket, See You Again and Leave Love Alone

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am in totaly shock as I go through pages and pages of these BAD reviews.  I spent WEEKS not buying this book because the reviews were so bad.  I had a few friends read it and say it was a fun read, so I decided to go ahead and buy it.  I just finished the first.  I was SO infatuated with this book, I could not put it down.  I do NOT like BDSM or whatever it is you refer to it as, so unlike thousands of others, I do not like it for the erotica.....frankly, that part is really BAD because it is so repeditive.  But the story captivates me and is GOOD!!  Sure, the writing is not exceptional due to them repeating the same thing on every other page, and the sex is so often that it doesn't even make it \\"fun\\" to read.  But the writing is no where near as bad as people make it out to be!  It is a great story, and a love story at that!  I am SO glad I went ahead and jumped on the bandwagon with this book.  I just put the first one down and can hardly wait to get the second one today.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|In The Innocent, David Baldacci gives us a world class hitman who develops a conscience just as his employers - a subcontractor of the US military - decide to remove him.  There are some lines even mercenaries are unwilling to cross and Robie refuses to kill a teenage girl who appears to be an innocent bystander.  Instead, Robie takes it upon himself to protect her even when it might cost him everything that he holds dear: his life, his profession, all ties to his life.<br /><br />Fortunately, David Baldacci is a master of action and suspense, so this implausible story comes alive.  Robie while unbelievable is an engaging hero and we find ourselves rooting for him just as he takes on an impossible burden.  The young girl is a typical teenager insofar as she's moody, difficult, and not fully appreciative of the risks that Robie takes - which helps the story along and endears her to both Robie and readers.  Another winner by David Baldacci.<br /><br />ISBN-10: 0446572993 - Hardcover $27.99<br />Publisher: Grand Central Publishing (April 17, 2012), 432 pages.<br />Review copy provided by the publisher and NetGalley.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. From the start, I found Christian Grey down-right sexy and appealing. Anastasia was funny (her inner goddess) and very quirky at times. I liked the set up for when she and Christian meet, and how their relationship starts out. You sense from the beginning that they are both hot for each other, but it is nice to see how that tension builds.<br /><br />My thoughts on the BDSM portion: It was a hot read, enough to whet your appetite for sure. When I think BDSM, I generally think of something a bit more hardcore than what takes place here, but by no means does that distract from the overall hotness of the scenes. Mr. Grey will make you swoon and keep you turning the pages to learn more about him.<br /><br />Now for the things that distracted me...I've heard it mentioned that the story line is comparable to Twilight, minus the vampires but add the kink. I have to say, the similarities were incredibly uncanny. I kept rolling my eyes (hmmm, what would Mr. Grey say about that?) because I was dumbfounded at how much it fell in line with Bella's character...why do that? It's been done, very successfully no less, but readers want fresh material.<br /><br />I finished this book in two days, hungry for more of Mr. Grey and his Red Room of Pain. Stay tuned for my review on book two.<br /><br />My Rating: 4 Stars (the only reason it didn't earn 5 was for the lack of character originality).
B007PTJOV0|4.0|honestly I think it is okay. it is fun, but a little challenging. if I had ever played Mario bros, it would be easier for me.
0345803493|4.0|Whew! The hotness continues, though I was disappointed because the title Fifty Shades Darker lead me to believe that the BDSM scenes were going to get darker,but instead, it was referring to the darker side of Christian. Not that that is a bad thing, just not what I was expecting. The story takes more of a romantic turn, all hearts and flowers as Ana would say.<br /><br />I liked the fact that Ana stands her ground on a few things, really challenging Christian. A man so used to power and control over every aspect of his life is suddenly questioning things because of this bossy little girl he is so smitten over. It's endearing to watch their relationship bud into something more than a sexual contract. Again, you sense where the entire story is headed.<br /><br />I liked learning more about Christian's past, his relationship with Elena, and his adoptive family. He opens up to Ana in ways he never has before; exposing some of the rawest parts of his past that molded him into the man he is today. Little by little, as Ana begins to understand where he is coming from, she reassures him of her love, something he can't wrap his head around because he feels he is unworthy of love. It is a constant and very redundant conversation that plays, \\"I love you. I will never leave you. You are mine.\\" A few times is enough to pull the point across that he has severe abandonment issues and needs constant reassurance of her love, but it gets to the point where you roll your eyes because it is just too much of the same stuff being said.<br /><br />The sex scenes were hot. The descriptions are sometimes overused, but not to the point of annoyance. One thing that is overused, okay two things: His gray eyes, yes we get it, the guy has gray eyes. And, the word mercurial ...how many frigging times can she use that word?! I now loathe that word.<br /><br />I keep coming back for more of Mr. Grey because there is still a lot to figure out about him. Stay tuned for my review on the last book inthe series.<br /><br />My Rating: 4 Stars (loss of one star for the overuse of certain words and phrases over and over and over and over).
B0086700CM|5.0|a great game I enjoyed every bit of it but it is more easy on phones get it its fun and free
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a truly fun game. So much so it will be ever so hard to stop playing. I recommend for adults and teenagers.
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun to play and i like play card... also u dont have to many interuptions.. try it i think u will enjoy it
0321811984|5.0|This book forever changed the way I design and use PowerPoint in the classroom!  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />I'll never design a death by PowerPoint presentation again, nor will I create a slidument.  My images are cleaner and more effective.  I wish I had read this book the day I started teaching.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|This game was great until I started buying gems. $380 later :(. I finally had to delete it off thekindle fire.
0321704452|5.0|Great read, lots of good ideas on how to make presentations more memorable and more effective.  I found this book to be incredibly helpful!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Rounding out the collection with some second releases, military and sifi stuff that you can drag out and watch time after time.... I missed this series when it came out on TV and just recently watched it on DVD... Great cast, good storyline, ashamed it didn't run longer...  This is a great series set and definitely a keeper...  Great price and great selection on movies... Fast shipping.... What can you say... Amazon and it's dealers are great.. I live in a rural area and have the world for a shopping mall thanks to them.... Not often do I applaud technology but I have to here....
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Kudos to every author who bleeds ink from their veins to tell a story!<br /><br />But,for me, this book is like an SBDM Fairytale.  Redundant and lame adjectives were used throughout the book and the few inspired phrases that were well crafted were used multiple times word for word. The second time you read them it's disappointing.  The characters were unrealistic and unrelatable.  In almost every piece of fiction I read, I can cast a character in my mind, but I could not do that with this book. The sex actually became boring because the banter in Anastasia's head was distracting and immature.  It became predictable.  And I can't beleive I am saying this, but there was too much of it that was over the top.<br /><br />I will admit that there were moments when the story sucked me into a fantasy world but it didn't hold me for long.<br /><br />This book is like junk food.  There's a place for it, and I occassionally like to indulge,  but I was hoping for a gourmet dinner after all the hype.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I have the Firefly series and had to have this to complete this set... I wished they would have come back with a few more seasons of this underrated sifi... Firefly & Serenity are keepers you can drag out and watch time after time.... Great price and great selection on movies... Fast shipping.... What can you say... Amazon and it's dealers are great.. I live in a rural area and have the world for a shopping mall thanks to them....
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|developers are really dedicated and improvements are frequent and well thought out. also a lot Support from other developers. I have used the free version.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is one of the best series I've watched in a very long time...  This series has a exhilarating story line, a great cast that you personally connect with, great action scenes that leave you on the edge of your seat...  It's captivating... I can't wait for season two....  I truly hope it's producers and directors do not screw it up by continuing to go out of their way to put sex scenes and nudity in it.... I know...  it's cable network and expected but with this outstanding story and strong characters it's just not needed.. I don't mind a little T&A but please don't mess up this series by struggling to introduce awkward shock & awe in the form of Adult Content... There's a couple of times early in the series it actually distracted from the storyline...  They got a good thing here...Just can't show to the kids....  I'm looking forward to several more seasons if the writers can last....<br />Great price match offer by Amazon on pre-order...  Amazon is Great!!!  Game Of Thrones Great!!!
B005FISC52|5.0|The shipping was fast. The quality of the product is perfect. I just finished watching the complete season and it was awesome! I love one tree hill! The only \\"bad\\" thing I would have to say is that this season should not be the last one! When you watch the end of 9th season, you just know that they could do a 10th season!
B00177YA1K|4.0|Filling in some gaps in the collection with some second releases, military and sifi stuff that you can drag out and watch time after time....

0345803485|5.0|This book arrived quickly and in great condition.  Everything you have heard about this book is true!!!!!!!!  Can't put it down........need to purchase book two!!
B005LAIH2W|2.0|I was very disappointed in this movie.  The acting was pretty shody & the story line was like a STAR WARS WANNABE, AVATAR without the epic features, and no credibility.  Disney lost on this one!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Funciona perfectamente en mi kindle fire, y se sincroniza sin ningun problema con lo que escribo en la laptop. Para cualquier persona que trabaje en oficina y tenga que idear proyectos, esta es una buena herramienta.
B001S86J0I|4.0|I love this movie.  The only thing that takes away from this low cost deluxe edition version is the fact that it's the censored version, which personally upsets me.  I would have liked to see the movie with its original audio.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addicting. u jump slide and turn ur way through the maze that never ends. and so try to buy/ upgrade everything
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love Sudoku, but never liked it on computers/phones due to clunky interfaces that were never any better than sitting down with a $.99 pulp book and a pencil.<br /><br />No more.<br /><br />This game plays exactly like I play - only I can actually read the notes and numbers I've written down. The puzzles are generated so you should never see a dupe, and there is a fairly large set of difficulty levels which is appreciated. If \\"Hard\\" is too hard, just knock it down a notch and don't worry that you're going to get something super simple.<br /><br />And the hint system is possibly the most perfect thing about this wonderful app. Want a pointer to get you looking in the right place? Ask for a hint. it'll tell you a row to look in, or a column, or a set of rows and columns. Not enough? Click hint again and it'll tell you what number to look for. If you're still stumped, click hint a third time and it tells you not only what the answer is, but also HOW YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT YOURSELF. Fantastic learning tool and exactly what I want in a game like this. This hint system is no crutch. Using it to learn now, I hope to some day master even the most difficult puzzles all on my own.<br /><br />As others have said, disable the tracking stuff, unless you like OpenFeint (as many do. I don't). Don't knock the rating of the game down for it, though, because this game deserves the highest rating it can get.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter (of Mars)is an incredible movie unjustly roasted by critics, practically abandoned by the studio and largely ignored by the American public. What a shame. Do yourself a favor and watch a modern classic so you can say you were there from the beginning.
B0086700CM|5.0|hahaha Im glad I finally got this for my kindle. The app works great. Temple run is so fun and addicting :)
B001H9JBW6|2.0|I'm surprised by the number of highly positive reviews posted here - from the start, I thought the story fell flat from its potential and I only hung in for the love story subplot.  I suppose if you weren't aware of all the ways data about our every electronic move are being used, it could be a shocking revelation.  But it felt like old news to me, and all of the twists and turns seemed like they'd been rehashed from other productions.  The ending (spoiler alert: the bad guys win in every possible way) certainly did not make up for how long and drawn out the plot was.<br /><br />For British drama that's chock full of conspiracies and cyber-stalking, moves fast with a lot of tension, and has intriguing characters, I'd recommend the MI-5 series instead.
0439023513|2.0|As if you read the first two books, the chance of getting this book is pretty high. Or that's what I did. But I could not stay focused for more than 1 page at a time. Compared to first book, this book was slow but I kept reading because I wanted to know the end. Maybe I was so keen to know how this book ends.<br />I wish there were more actual exciting events in this book. I rated 2 stars because I won't be reading this book again. However, if the movie comes out, I will go see it.
B007MU85D0|5.0|So, I'll be honest.  I got this album not because I was passionately in love with this band, or even because of how catchy \\"Little Talks\\" is.  I bought this because it was on sale for something like $3.<br /><br />Having listened to it thoroughly over the last several weeks (and, in doing so, practically foresaking all other music in the process) I couldn't be happier!  Granted, there are a few songs that I skip over now... but only because I have fallen so madly in love with others.  \\"Dirty Paws\\", their opening track, is definitely my favorite.<br /><br />The way these two singers harmonize and play off each other is absolutely enchanting, not to mention their lyrics are very engaging and worth listening to several times over in an attempt find better  meaning (though, little talks still has me reeling).  All in all, it is a wonderful album... even at full price!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I have read the trilogy in actual paper format, liked it a great deal and was looking to purchase it for my kindle fire library when I did some simple math.  Purchasing the books seperately is $2.00 cheaper then buying the trilogy in a bundle.  Think I will keep that $2.00 and say a mental thanks to my elementary school teachers from long ago for teaching my how to add.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is definitivily the best Album Rush has ever done. Absolutely Astounding. A Sonic Masterpiece! The Greatest Rock Band Ever!
B005K17RU0|4.0|it seems to be very accurate and for kodiak Alaska that is saying a lot! the best feature is the extended forcast! sure helps out a lot.
B005L38QK2|3.0|for this price it should have more buttons. Or have it flash for each elite demon you kill, and or they should have added in a small vib to it for when your life is below 20% reminding you to take a poition, or even auto poition. really now.. for this price I expect much more.<br /> ( if you want a 7 botton gaming mouse, Razer makes the Tron mouse that is cheaper and has the buttons you need, and is also a sweet techie item to have.. even the whole set of mouse and mousepad with trails is cheaper than this mouse)<br /> as of 6-13-12
B0054JZC6E|5.0|sooooooooooooooooo much fun I like that there are so many games but. you can work up to them it is probably the best game ever
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Where did this album come from? This album is astounding. A musical, lyrical, and conceptual tour de force, Rush has shown that they just get better with age. Clockwork Angels reminds me of 2112 in that both are stories about a person, in a place, experiencing things. But while 2112 was the work of a super-talented but young band, Clockwork Angels is the work of mature musical masters, comfortable with each other, long-time masters of their respective instruments, and willing to do exactly what they want. This album is beautiful, vibrant, musically complex (naturally), but thematically complex as well. The soft beginning to BU2B beautifully captures the mood of a distant, steampunk land. I don't know where this album came from. Snakes and Arrows wasn't my favorite Rush album, and then they come out with this, which is just incredible.<br /><br />I've always loved Rush. They are probably, overall, my favorite band, and this album is easily one of their best.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|The Grey is a decent movie. I hesitated to purchase it and watch due to the \\"highlighted\\" reviews. But if you like to struggle with themes of life and death - fate, then this is a good movie. Not sure why others didn't like it - maybe expecting too much or more of a hollywood spin - but this movie doesn't take the high or low road. It just is.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays a great role. The other actors are excellent too. You see men who have to wake up and deal with their feelings about the reality of their life and the prospects of dying or living. And how they want to go out - if they have a choice. It's worth 3.99 without a doubt. Enjoy.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|I had several people try to install this unit on a laptop with Vista with no success. I'm not sure if just because we don't know were doing or if it's not compatible. We are going to try to install it on a computer with XP. Hopefully we'll have more success.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I enjoy games like this. good seek and find. puzzles challenging but not impossible. keeps you entertained.  well worth the money. cant wait for more like it.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is an amazing game. the only problem I had with it was not wanting to put it down.
0307719774|4.0|I bought this journal in December of my freshman year. I thought it would be interesting to see how my opinions of things changed as I went through high school and into my first year of adulthood.<br /><br />The book itself is incredibly well-made. Very sturdy (which is good considering it's supposed to last you 5 years lol). I read some complaints about how small the book is. Yes, it is on the smaller side, I suppose, but it's appropriate for what it is and makes it easy to take with you. The page size, on the smaller side once again, have also not been a problem for me.<br /><br />The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I was expecting something a little more deep, more...to the soul, I guess I could say. But most of the questions are not like that. Although, I guess from what I've been doing, what makes the questions deep are not the questions themselves but the answers you give.<br /><br />I would get this for someone as a Christmas gift because, naturally, the book starts on January 1st. I think it would be a good gift for someone starting high school, college, or maybe just entering a new chapter in their life.
B006OAB3ME|1.0|I have always loved the Beatles, and have like their individual works, but this collection is slow, and nasaly--awful. I didn't even make it through the whole cd--sorry Paul.
1466401885|3.0|Had high hopes for this book, but it did not really do anything for me. It was a light read and nothing very exciting went on in the book.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|As others have posted, just google it, UltraViolet Digital Copy is a joke and is useless.  You must create an UltraViolet account, then a Flixster account. It doesn't end there. If after doing so you will find that UltraViolet supports only Apple IOS, but not all releases. I have a Verizon droid with the Flixster app also along with downloading the Flixster app to my desktop and Ipad. I have two Paramount movies with Ultra Violet (Hugo and Adventures of Tin Tin), I had to download a Paramount desktop app.  In order to view them I had to download the Paramount app to my Ipad.  I downloaded the Flixster App on the IPad but none of my UltraViolent Movies are available in my \\"collections\\".  Don't forget to sign in to Flixster with your facebook account to receive your free gifts (old movies).  Since Green Lantern is a Warner Brothers film, I then had to download \\"Flixster Collections\\" desktop app and the Warner brothers desktop app. Now none of my four UltraViolet movies or the four \\"free\\" movie gifts from Facebook are in my Flixster or Flixster Collections app and my redemption codes are no longer valid! I did manage through Paramount to download my two purchases to my IPad but not to my Droid which UltraViolet does not support.  Yet there is no way to download Warner brothers Green Lantern to my desktop, Droid, or Ipad.  I understand copyright infringement but when I purchase a product that states digital download, I should be able to view and/or stream it to my computer, phone, or Ipad. No more buying anything with UltraViolet stateing it is a digital download is an absolute lie and a consumer rip off. Any attorneys out there?  I want a class action law suit!
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first two books, they kept me wanting more through to the last page! But I'm sad to say this one was hard for me to stay interested in and took about 5 times as long to get through.<br /><br />The first two parts sort of drug out way too long while the action in the end was completely cut short and I feel kind of leaves you wondering what happened in the end? Where did all the story telling go?<br /><br />On a brighter note, I more than likely will pick up the first book again someday because I enjoyed it soo much!
B007VCMGPM|5.0|Before listening to this album, I thought that Steve Vai's Fire Garden was the best instrumental guitar album ever, but this has surpassed it. I'm now officially a fan of John 5. This album was so close to being the perfect album. There were only two songs that I found okay, Creepy Crawler and The Lie You Live. Everything else was superb. John 5 has definitely established himself as one of the elite when it comes to modern day guitarists. I would imagine if you're a pure metal head, there might be a couple of songs on this album that's not your cup of tea, but this album is still worth getting. I'm definitely going to check out some of the older albums of John 5 and his work with other artist after listening to this album. Just pure excellence!!! 5 out of 5. 10 out of 10. A+. 100%. Perfect score. I can't think of anything else to emphasize how great this album is. Stop reading this review and get this album.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|since I don't use it unless I absolutely need to, I think it's fantastic for what it does. I can't ignore other reviewers' remarks about poor memory storage and new terms of use, but I have yet to use it for anything other than making a shopping list or dumping my brain. and someone said Springpad is better, but I've tried that too and it's not as easy to use or nice to look at.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game, but hate the adds though! I never have a proble with it ever. I would recommend it.
B005IYNQAY|5.0|'Speaker For The Dead' is Easily one of the best books I've ever had the fortune to read.<br />I honestly liked Ender's Game but there were many parts that I wasn't happy with. There was absolutely nothing I wasn't happy with in 'Speaker For The Dead' except for the number of Spanish/Portuguese names. I haven't studied the language to any degree so even with Mr Card's pronunciation guide in the front of the book, I honestly had trouble with some of the names and sometimes couldn't tell a couple characters apart.<br /><br />'Speaker For The Dead' is an amazing story with a perfect amount of drama and I was immensely satisfied with the purchase. The ONLY thing I recommend if you're buying it or thinking of buying it, or reading it at all, is DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION until you've finished the book.<br /><br />I read it first because it's at the start of the book, and it's a really good introduction, I commend Mr Card for writing it, it's much more interesting than the ones I've read in other books. But it gives away the secret of the whole book! Mr Card has invented a Fantastic Tale with a brilliant plot and he gives away the whole thing, the twist, before you even start!<br /><br />If you hold the intro until you read the book a second time, you're in for a great experience.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a fan since 1985.  This is ballsier than anything they've done in decades.  I've had mixed feelings about everything they've done since the 80s, and Snakes and Arrows definitely sounded like they were starting to get old, but this album turns the clock back in a big way.  (And wow, the Taurus bass pedals are back too.  Make sure your sub is adjusted).
0345803485|1.0|America what are you thinking?  This book is horribly written .  The publisher should be ashamed of neglecting to edit before rushing off to print.  I cannot believe it has achieved top seller status.
B007JRUA7K|1.0|Truly BORING ~  and all five of my guests thought the same ~<br />I can't think of twenty more words to say about this movie, so I<br />had to  \\" say i can't \\" .
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I'm a 44 year old American woman who does not like violence & does not like wasting my time, so I thought I'd maybe like this series at best.  It is not typcially my kind of show at all, BUT I'm so glad that I gave this series a chance, because I LOVE this series more than anything I have ever seen in the movies, read about, or on TV!  Let me say, that I am referring to season 1 & the prequel - not season 2 (that is only fair).  The writing, acting, EVERYTHING is a masterpiece in season 1.  The violence & sex were always related to the story in some way.  I don't ever think there will be anything like it again which is sad, but I will be forever thrilled that I had this experience!  It is something you have to see in order to determine if it is something you will love as much as I.  Each episode builds.  There are a lot of surprises (which is unusual for me since I've seen/heard just about everything as an ER mental health worker).  Be open & give it a chance - it might end up being a favorite for you too.  You can always stop watching it.  Oh, by the way, strangely I liked watching the series more on my kindle than on my 52 inch screen HD tv - it seemed like I was right there in the action!  So, don't hesitate to give an episode a try on a kindle if you have one.  One more thing, I heard that the next season will be the last.  That makes sense, because that seems true & natural - plus the show was never the same with the change of some of it's characters in season 2.  I hope the last season is at least good but regardless I am so thankful for all the folks who gave me a little taste of masterpiece in my lifetime!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie really blew my mind. Being a huge Alien fan had me going to see it but what I got was something more. A movie that made me think. I love thinking & so many movies are brainless to me. I love thinking about creation & evolution. This universe is so vast & spectacular things happen when you can explore like this crew does. This is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. Thanks Ridley!
B005IQZB14|2.0|I'm only writing this review to WARN YOU that you may want to skip the bloody shooting of a beloved horse that goes from bad to worse; you will know it when you get to these pages so you will have time to skip it if desired.  I was upset when I read this portion of the story & could only hope there was a good reason for it to be included but... I did not get any meaning out of that section or actually any part of the story which surprised me given the great reviews & I usually love reading about peoples' experiences.<br /><br />I gave the book 2 stars for the mildly entertaining stories about the people she met along the trail, because it was an easy read, & because it sounded fairly honest.  I found the story emotionally unsatisfying.  I didn't care for the author & was unmoved by her words.  She seemed as open & honest as possible looking back into her youth.  The experience she described sounded fairly typical for a person in their twenties who was self-absorbed with little depth especially in the last half of the book.<br /><br />The author may have been transformed but it was not clear as to how - it probably would not have mattered much ultimately to understand this if there was something compelling somewhere else in the story.  Remember that this book is truly an unsentimental memoir that has little to do with hiking the PCT.  If that sounds good to you, go for it.  If you are finding you are not enjoying it, it does not get better in my opinion.  My friend read this & liked it, so it is truly personal preference.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book.have purchased 2&3.would read more books by this author.I've never read any other book like this. I think every guy who cares about women should read this book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very entertaining game. Really enjoy this great classic. hours of fun for all ages.  recommend to others to try for themselves.
B005HSL626|4.0|my kids love this game. my 10 year old could play this forever, she tries to beat my score every time.
0470450266|3.0|See title. Most other reviewers here have it right about the book quality. My problem is I wondered if anybody has had trouble with being able to listen to the audio on the CD's included videos as I have. The CD's chapters include videos with Scott describing his workflow as he sculpts the model. What a shame... the sibilance in the voice recording is brutal on the ears. Basically any SS SSSound that he SSSaySSS iSSSS incredibly loud and impoSSSible to LLLiSSSten to!!! ARGHH! It's so frustrating because Spencer is a great teacher and the material here is invaluable.<br /><br />It's like the audio quality was a complete afterthought and he just recorded it off his Macbook or something and called it a day.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed this app because it has lots of customizable features and is easy to use. Also, not too many adds and doesnt freeze.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.  I think everyone should get this app.One of my favorite apps ever.Get the app it is FUN.
1603427244|5.0|When you want a particular cast on or cast off, this book is what you need to have great illustrations and photographs to demonstrate each method. The book is organized by Cast On (stretchy, circular, basic, decorative) and bind off (same idea, stretchy, as for necklines, basic, decorative and sewn.) The best place to use each is discussed, and there are great photographs of the detail of each kind of cast on and bind off.<br /><br />There are two cast-on's that were of particular interest to me; the Channel Island cast on, which is not only elastic, but has decorative bumps rather like picots or \\"teeth.\\" And the Cat Bordhi \\"Moebius\\" cast on (which is not the irritating twist in circular casting on, that's a disaster) but a way to make a twisted tube that can become a shrug, hood, shawl, etc.<br /><br />The book is full of good photographs showing needle, yarn and hand position and the stages of the cast on or bind off. I have been knitting for fifty years, but I forget how to do some of the more arcane style of casting on, for example--we stick with what we know best but it may not be ideal for every application.<br /><br />If you knit, this is a really handy reference--I constantly need to review the more infrequently used methods for cast on and bind off. This really is a helpful reference and I recommend it highly.<br /><br />BONUS ITEMS for the review: There are two cast ons not in the book (because I invented one of them and stole the other idea from machine knitting.) Not faulting the book, but I thought I'd mention them here because I use both quite a bit and they are helpful.<br /><br />The first is a provisional cast on using waste yarn and a \\"ravel cord\\". In the book, the waste yarn method is the crochet method (where you mount stitches onto a crochet chain that can be removed to release live stitches. These can be picked up or grafted later to make a seamless join.)<br /><br />The problem with the crochet method is two-fold (though it's a very useful technique.) One--it's bad for fuzzy yarns. Can be difficult to pull off the chain and release stitches that can be picked up cleanly and easily and two, you have to be consistent in picking up your cast on into the back of the crochet stitch (the \\"tea kettle handle\\" part of the chain stitch.) If you pick up occasionally into the front of the crochet chain, it becomes difficult to release stitches later.<br /><br />So a substitute for this method (if your eyesight isn't up to the crochet method or you are using a very fuzzy yarn) is to cast on with your fave method using a smooth, similar gauge yarn and simply knit two to four inches in this \\"waste yarn.\\" Then, knit one row (or round) of smooth, 1/8\\" satin ribbbon, which is widely available at any store carrying sewing or craft items. Cut this at the end of the row, leaving a four inch or longer tail. Now, start knitting in your working yarn. When it's time to release the stitches, you can either pick up the bottom loop of the working yarn through the back of the ribbon stitch, or you can pull out the ribbon, which will release smoothly from the yarn because it's slippery.  It helps to use a contrasting ribbon color; for example, using a dark waste yarn or dark working yarn, use a bright, light ribbon, and vice versa.<br /><br />The second method (my invention) is a circular cast on (for starting shawls or round objects that begin with 8 or so stitches in the center of a circle.) Wrap yarn around your finger once or twice leaving a five inch tail of yarn, then dip into the center of this loop, pull up a loop onto your needle and pull a loop through that (as if you were crocheting.) Repeat seven more times. Mount these 8 stitches on four needles  and start your knitting. Pull the loop tight. The first 8 stitches will be longer than the rest--and it will look like a daisy. Very nice for starting lace shawls or doilies. I've never seen this method anywhere (though I'm sure someone else has invented it, too) but I love it for lace circular knitting.or lace circular knitting.

B00881VLCE|5.0|If you love puzzles than this is the app for you. Dont let the word magic in the name throw you off. it isn't magic. It is basically having multiple puzzles on your favoritee electronic device. I went camping a few days ago and sitting down in the sun while doing a puzzle was magnificientt. Highly recommend this app for anyone that loves puzzles and relaxation.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|kills time very easily. it's. a very addicting app and I haven't. made any in-game purchases yet. I've. become addicted to the kung-fu scratch mini game.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so much fun. But like all games, it gets boring after u have it for a while. I love it though! Its so cool.
1423136802|4.0|Where to begin...  It came a day earlier than predicted (Which I always love) and was very well packaged.  The books are great!  I really got into the Greek Mythology with these books.  The author, in my opinion, really did his research and made the characters real.  I don't enjoy reading and it may be a while before I get into another series again, but these books were extremely entertaining.

B001MS7IBS|4.0|Everything was great, I love this show and I didn't have the blu ray collection so I decided to buy it once and for all. When I received this one (first season) I was really excited about it, but I expected a little more about the features regarding the subtitles, because I'm more comfortable with the spanish subs (which is my mother language), I know that it was my fault 'cause I didn't see the product details, but I must say that there was no other offer with this characteristics, I mean there is no blu ray of Fringe first season with spanish subtitles. Anyway I'm almost the happiest girl with my collection. I just need the fourth season and we are complete!!
B007SGM084|1.0|I don't understand... there are no printing costs, inventory costs -- why does this trilogy cost so much?  One of the reasons I love my Kindle is the cost of a book is less than that of one on paper (hard or soft cover). It makes no sense to me.  We are saving trees.  This is a download for goodness sake!
B0086700CM|5.0|a very fun addicting game. simple controls and instructions, graphics are funny. very happy  with it. good for killing time on the bus or whatever.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is my first review, and I'm glad to be writing it up for this app.  This installs and plays extremely well on my Samsung Charge.  Graphics are good, menus are clear, and the game play is smooth and enjoyable. The levels increase in difficulty at a linear and predictive rate.  This one is worth your time and money.  Simply put, the Developers earned my 5-Star vote!

B007URCTOG|2.0|This is the consummate chick flick. Based on true events it reads like a campfire story for the romantic notions of love without boundries. Having to watch this after an actual wedding only added to its pompous blow by blow of situational angst for the poor main characters. Have your phone handy to sneak in a sports score or two during the swollen violin scores you will endure. Brace yourselves and be willing to present a hanky.
1781161097|5.0|When Prometheus: Art of the Film was originally made available for preorder early on in the year for $19.95, I knew I had to preorder a copy with my Amazon Prime account. When the book finally arrived, it is everything I wanted in an art book and more. The book is hardcover and expansive, showing concept arts and storyboards that were adapted into the film and early concept works that were discarded in preference of other mediums (i.e. original Fifield transformation concept, the introduction scene, etc.). The book also has a plethora of graphic novel style storyboard of the screenplay, highlighting key important scenes of the movie as well as:<br /><br />* 3D rendering of various spacecrafts, vehicles and alien life forms that we see in the movie<br />* Sculptures of the creatures we see, including preproduction clay models.<br />* Costume designs<br />* The behind-the-scene making of the sets (both concept art, pencil sketching, actual wooded construction to finalized sets)<br />* Details on what went into the designs (the Prometheus, the lifeboat, planet, the pyramid mounds, Weyland Industries, the ampule room, Juggernaut, etc.)<br />* The gratuitous section on the Engineers is worthwhile in itself<br /><br />I think the best thing about this book is the supplementary text by the people who were involved in the movie, including Ridley Scott. These supplementary text not only explain the design, thoughts and process in designing the film - but chunks and pieces of the text clarified bits and pieces of the film, including the Alien universe. For example, Scott confirmed that LV-426 is a different planet and that the black slime is a form of biological weapon whom its creator could not ultimately control. All-in-all, this art book is instant gratification for the visual sensors - and a great addition to art book collectors, or just to anyone who enjoyed the film and would like to know more about the story and the effort involved behind the making of the film.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is one of the best story out there. I love the series!  I hope that George Lucas continue to make great movies.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Not an exagerrated review, and not a long one. Rush's latest release is far better than anything they have done in a loooong time. They have meshed what was brilliant about the 80;s..Avante garde about the 90's and fresh about he 2000's.<br />There are some wonderful keyboard work and some wonderful melodies.Anybody  who states differently have earwax stuck in their brains.<br /><br />All of them are on top of their game and play fabulously. Get this now.
B000002572|5.0|I had this album when I was a teenager and loved it then and was over the moon when I found it on Amazon. I still love listening to it now. Great album!
1936608898|5.0|As an owner of a CrossFit affiliate I've read just about every book there is to read about the Paleo Diet over the last few years.  \\"It Starts with Food\\" is, in my opinion, the perfect starting place for someone looking to change their habits and take a 30-day challenge to get started.  The book is very user-friendly and much more entertaining than some of its more \\"scienc-y\\" cousins on the shelf.  I am already recommending that my clients read this and get started on the program right away!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fabulous game. I love it! The animation is great as well as the sound effect. I would definately recommend this game to all friends and family.
0547569653|5.0|Everything is cool about this book. At first it is strange to find a recipe at the end of the first chapter, but then it becomes a pattern and it absolutely makes sense. It is a way to stay connected to practicality and day to day reality even when the story takes us to extreme as well as unknown territories. Scott Jurek is honest and direct. He is no hero, but not the average guy neither. He is one of the best example of an ordinary man doing extraordinary things. Having read the book right after Rich Roll's \\"finding ultra\\" I must say that I found Jurek's much better. Scott Jurek has been around 15 years. He is not the last medias sensation. He has accumulated titles, records and honors by the dozen year after year after year and really speaks from an extensive experience allowing him to go deep into the understanding of his own path. I love the permanent questioning. I find it sometimes missing in \\"too-good-to-be-true-success-stories\\". Here the questions go far and reach deep inside. I love the technical tips. I love the extensive description of his training sessions. I love the way he describes how his vegan diet allows him to enjoy food at an even higher level. I love the fair recount of his own weaknesses and contradictions. The book is obviously highly inspirational, but for profound reasons. It is not about just the achievement, it is really all about the path taken to get there and the lesson learnt in the process. And this is why, in addition of being very easy and fun to read, it is also very precious.
B007LB1O3I|2.0|I don't know why I keep buying Madonna's cd.  I am not a fan of her dance songs.  I like dance, hard rock, and pop. Maybe I am trying to listen to something different. Her songs are very short and kinda noisy without a punch.  The songs keep repeating the same beat over and over.  The songs get old very fast.  Compared to Femme Fatale from Britney Spears, Femme Fatale is a whole lot louder and longer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I highly recommend. my high score is 567,477. I love it. yes sometimes it lags. but not all the time. its free:)
0547569653|5.0|I remembered Scott Jurek's name from Christopher McDougall's fantastic book, Born to Run.  When I saw Scott had a book coming out, I was interested and veganism was the hook.  I want to move more to a plant-based diet and this book is encouraging - not at all preachy.  Eat & Run is a  fascinating story of endurance, (both in life as well as in running ultras) but I never expected the book to be so poignant, especially about his relationship with his mother.  I started to run a year ago because my 12 yr. old son started running cross country and I wanted to be out there with him.  I had never run in my life and now run farther than he does (of course, he runs a LOT faster).  So glad I read it.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|John J. Martinez basically has it all covered.  A fantastic review.  I would just like to add a few of my observations or comments about the music.  Mr. Martinez explained each song.  If there is really any bad points with the music on this album is that it is more thematic than other Rush albums.  It has a story running through it and one that will later be a novel.  \\"Concept\\" albums are usually the poorest sellers of most bands.  Exceptions being Pink Floyd and the Who come to mind.  The Kinks got dropped from two labels due to their grandiose concept albums (I, being a big fan still bought and liked those albums, but few others did).  I feel that the most recent Nightwish album suffers from being tied to closely to a storyline.  But this Rush album is actually really good anyway.  Of course Rush has some experience with this in a different form.  They have a few songs that are in several related tracks spanning several albums.  Stories among many unrelated songs on the same albums that connect with a later album's song; a fairly unique technique.<br /><br />About this album specifically, Alex gets more guitar solos in than on the last several Rush albums.  And the solos are really varied, and different from most that he has ever done before.  I don't know if anyone else has noticed it, but I definitely hear a lot of things on this album that remind me of Led Zeppelin.  Not that any song sounds like a LZ song, just a lot of little subtleties.  And that is not a bad thing.  The point being, I don't ever remember Rush reminding me of anyone other than Rush.  I have all their original albums (not all compilations).  Well, as a professional musician friend of mine once said, there are only so many notes in a scale.<br /><br />On the down side, the lyrics on this album don't grab me immediately as much as some of my favorite Rush songs.  But perhaps as I understand the story better I'll get into it more.  Also the tempo of the middle of the albums get a bit repetitive.But not so much as to make it boring. I really liked Neil's sci fi stuff on many past albums.  I just love the strangeness of the repeated line \\"1001001\\" in \\"The Body Electric\\" I believe that is binary for 73.  Could 1973 be the year the band originally formed?  As I said at the outset, Martinez got it down.  Hopefully you get something out of my doodlings here.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I think you can guess why I rated the movie 1-star. Sadly I have reached wits end with this scam digital copy garbage cloud.  This makes three different movies/three different studios where this ultraviolet digital cloud is a disaster at best.  I work in IT and I have never seen such a horrific conglomeration of useless websites with such complexity.  I am beginning to think digital copy is a complete scam.
1606860909|2.0|What a terrible book! The characters were unlikeable, the plot was predictable, and the premise of 19 ex-girlfriends named Katherine was too ridiculous for me to believe in the story. I thought \\"show, don't tell\\" is just a writing tip learned in elementary school, but John Green could have used it: the main character spends the whole book analyzing himself and others to no end. I kept giving it chances, but in the end I regretted wasting any time reading it.
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 books in the Hunger Games series, even though there are aspects that readers either agree or disagree with, love or hate. I just read them all, back-to-back, accepting the author's vision of the story, and enjoyed (when possible) the ride. I think she pulled it off and stand in admiration.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Few albums have been released that have grown on me as much as \\"Funeral.\\" Admittingly I didn't see what all the commotion was about when I listened to the album the first time, even the second time. But something snapped in me and I realized the genius of the repetition, the gradual building up of instrumentals, the aching, beseeching vocals of pain and suffering. Each song is crafted brilliantly and for the patient listener you're rewarding with deep lyrics, epic breakdowns, and soaring choruses. If heaven could sound like anything, I'm sure Funeral would be playing right after you enter the pearly white gates. There's a ton of heart, emotion, and a fear of growing older deeply embedded in this album. Even in the angst is there a child-like quality, a playful, crazy attitude of rebellion in the vocals. This is Arcade Fire at it's finest.
B0086700CM|5.0|really fun game but sometimes a little glichy although its easy to buy different characters and boosts for the game with the coins you earn by playing really fun game I reccomend it!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun game that I share with my grandbabies.  well there are some down load issues we enjoy playing this.  there needs to be more ways to get acorns though this shouldn't cost everytime to build
B0086700CM|5.0|the only thing that I don't like is that it glitches out while your running.  other than that its a really great game.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|What a fun movie. And now it is being made in to a Broadway musical, written by Harvey Fierstein and music by Cyndi Lauper!  Can't wait to see that!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|A true powerful miracle of epic Rush proportions. This album is a triumph and packed with power and emotion. 12 songs -- all dynamic and masterful. Buy this now!
B005LAIGWS|3.0|Okay, I am going to try to not give away any parts of the story or the movie too much in case you actually buy this film.<br /><br />Ghost Rider is the best comic character ever!!!  With that being said, that is the only reason I gave this movie a rating of 3 stars.  I am a huge Ghost Rider fan and this movie really disappointed me.  Moreau was a good character, Carion was a good character, Nic Cage was good too (when they didn't have him \\"extreme\\" acting and jittering around)...even the mother was a good character in it.  Unfortunately Sony screwed this movie up so bad by changing Danny's story line, they could've easily made this into the Spirit of Vengeance comic line w/ Blaze losing most of his power but still helping out the new rider, and Danny becoming the new Ghost Rider would've been a great lead into future movies...but instead they came out with this mixed up decayed script and filming that was an ultimate failure.  Ghost Rider doesn't levitate, he doesn't drive a crappy looking bike, his biker gear/clothes don't look like burnt marshmellows would...the direction of this movie was horrible as it was made by the people that did Crank as a movie of Crank.  While I love Crank it was not the way to do a comic movie, too jittery way too often in the movie...made it cheesy and lame.  This movie should have had more ties to the first since that one had a much better story, and again...it really didn't.  Ultimately, if I wasn't a huge fan of Ghost Rider I would've never seen this in theater or bought the bluray (so I guess they win since I did still buy the bluray).<br />Another disappointment was Best Buy had an exclusive steel book case if you reserved your copy early.  I reserved mine as soon as it was available and there was supposed to be combo disc sets as there are with most movies these days.  When I went to buy the movie I was told that it was a last minute change by the company to make more money by only selling individual discs...WTH?  My kids follow my lead and look up to me and they like most of the same things I do.  I am a huge Ghost Rider fan, so they follow suit.  How disappointed they were to see the bluray didn't come w/ a DVD copy for them to watch in their room.  Another disappointment since there is no way I would ever pay double the cost for this movie.  I will have to wait for it to join part 1 int he $5.00 DVD bin before they ever get a copy to watch on their DVD players...what a let down.
0141301155|5.0|The story of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is an amazing tale of a young and poor boy who lives in a small cottage at the end of town. One day, in his Father's newspaper, he reads that Mr. Willy Wonka, the owner of the world famous chocolate factory in his neighborhood, is placing 5 Golden Tickets in his famous Willy Wonka's Chocolate bars. Those who find them will be invited to Mr. Wonka's chocolate factory for a special tour.<br /><br />The children who find these golden tickets are (in order from first to last) Augustus  Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beaugarde, Mike Teavee, And little Charlie Bucket.<br /><br />Once at the factory, they are eliminated one by one in order of ticket findings. After each one is eliminated, the Oompa Loompas sing a song about their fate:  Augustus Gloop goes up a chocolate pipe, Veruca Salt gets pushed down the trash chute by a group of smartly trained squirrels, Violet Beaugarde chews a piece of gum and turns into a huge blueberry, and Mike Teavee shrinks when teleporting himself by television. Charlie survives every task and is rewarded with a life-time supply of chocolate and the privilege of living at the Chocolate Factory, as well as owning it once he is old enough.<br /><br />This story is fascinating. It was written by Roald Dahl in 1964. I was excited and drawn into the story from beginning to end. It was a pleasure to have the privilege to read it.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />  Natasha A. Allard  (submitted by her third grade teacher)
B00275EHJG|5.0|My 3 yr old grandson watches this over and over and has all of the figures. Best of the 3 Toy Story movies.
B007BVOF8E|1.0|I wanted so much to enjoy this movie, because I am a fan of John le Carre's books.  But, I was so bored!  I could not follow the \\"intelligent\\" storyline, not because I'm not intelligent, but because I couldn't stop thinking to myself \\"Geez, I wish this wasn't so frigging BORING!!\\"  There were so many of my favorite actors, all of which are incredible talents, but all the characters they played were so flat and colorless and humorless and uninteresting!  What a waste.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I listened to this on an audiobook, which adds a lot to the ambiance at times. However, I haven't even finished it and have already pre-ordered the next book. I loved the premise that two educated people from entirely different life circumstances and even different species can be drawn to each other, despite all the obstacles they must overcome. The love Diana and Matthew share is strong and should satisfy romantics who like fantasy and romance combined. There aren't any blatant sex scenes (so far), just fairly mild connecting. If you want graphic sex books involving vampires, there's plenty out there. If you want a fantasy love story with a plot, I absolutely recommend this one. And I'm thrilled that the next book continues the story of Diana and Matthew. I'm so glad to have found a new author that makes me look forward to the next great read.
0345529057|5.0|Please buy these books, they are a fantastic read, lots of story and good backup characters to really immerse yourself in. As for the packaging it arrived damaged, the box that the books came in was ripped up and for some reason WATER damaged as well. Kinda sad about the box but I'm sure yours will be fine. Im looking into seeing if Amazon can send me another box for it, it would be nice to be able to have the set all together! Anyways the books are really small in size, but that means it has a LOT of pages, about 800 pages for the first one.However they are made of nice material, they bend easily and the pages don't get all messed up when you open them. And they are a wonderful delight for packing and traveling! I'm currently on a road trip across the United States and i got these for my trip. They are a wonderful addition for any time i need to just relax from exploring and reading in our RV. If you like small sized books these are the perfect addition to your collection! (just make sure you tell Amazon to do a better job that what i got!) lol. Enjoy them folks!

B0034G4P94|5.0|When i first saw this movie i had no intention of buying it. I never heard of it before, and i had seen so many other fighting movies it didn't appeal to me. The only reason i got it at first was because i needed a 4th DVD for blockbuster's 4 for 20$ deal (sometimes if you're lucky its 5 for 20$) So i was desperate to get any DVD to complete the deal and had no idea this movie would turn out to be one of my favorites EVER! That may seem like a big thing to say, but this movie really does have it all. I was completely surprised by how good the story was, how great the acting was, and how i could keep going form start to finish in one sitting. (and its not exactly a short film haha) Heres what you get from this movie:<br /><br />Tom Hardy is now one of my favorite actors, the way he portrays Tommy is full of emotion and dedication to what he wants to do. You end up cheering for him even though he plays a guy with an attitude. Whats great about this film is that you can relate to pretty much ANYONE. For anyone who has had problems with paying for their home bills, Joel Edgerton who play's Tommy's brother in the film does a fantastic job as a father who is desperate to make a life better for his family. You really end up relating to the brothers in their own way.  And when it comes to knowing how to draw your attention in Nick Nolte does an AMAZING job as the father of the two brothers (in my opinion he should have won the Oscar for best supporting Actor but WHATEVER) From there the movie really picks up, showing great shots of city streets as they train for an upcoming martial arts tournament as well as what the MMA media world really looks like with fighters from all over the world coming together. As for the ending i defy you to try and not feel any emotion, but thats all I'm going to say.<br /><br />This movie is worth your money, If you get it for 5 dollars or even 20 at a Best Buy or something. The acting is fantastic, and the characters really actually feel likereal people. Thats what movies struggle with to get my attention, i like to actually feel like I'm in the movie, not just staring at a screen for 2+ hours. Rent this movie if you must just to be sure, but you will enjoy it. Fantastic job and i commend everything that went into making this movie.<br /><br />EXTRAS INCLUDE:<br /><br />\\"Redemption: Bringing Warrior To Life\\" Documentary<br />\\"Philosophy In Combat: Mixed Martial Arts Strategy\\"<br />Simply Believe: A Tribute to Charles \\"Mask\\" Lewis, Jr.<br />Cheap Shots: Gag Reel<br />Brother vs. Brother: Anatomy Of The Fight<br /><br />and more!<br /><br />so there you go! hope this helps you make up your mind. I know i enjoyed this movie and you will too!

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Every five words is a cuss word. They can't even have a normal conversation without throwing a \\"F this S\\" and \\"MF don't TELL me what to do\\". It's ridiculous how often they swear...it's just as annoying as if they were saying \\"giraffe\\" every five seconds.<br /><br />The wolves are digital...enough said. I hate digital crap it looks beyond fake. Jurassic Park is 19 years old and the dinosaurs today still look way more realistic than any digital stuff in today's movies. Also, the wolves are way too big and sometimes aren't even making wolf sounds...Hollywood created their own sounds to try and make them scarier. I give props to the 2006 horror flick \\"The Breed\\" for using real dogs.<br /><br />The actors aren't convincing and I could care less if any of them die in the flick, but they try to make it sad every time one of them gets killed.<br /><br />The ending was awful. I was actually thinking, oh wow this is gonna get GOOD! Then BAM, it's over, they didn't show how it ended. Left it up to the imagination I suppose...haha how creative.
0307951529|5.0|I found this book totally by accident while looking for traditional business books but happy I decided to purchase. Having already decided to start my own business, I thought it would at least validate my decision. Boy, did it ever!<br /><br />Even if you are just considering starting your own business, The $100 Startup is a great read to see how everyday people have successfully created businesses with very little money. All that's required is a little imagination.<br /><br />Does it answer everything you need to know about running a business? Of course not. What it does is give you tools to get started and build your business in practical ways by following real people, not fictional case studies.<br /><br />The website -- 100startup.com -- also offers free resources mentioned in the book. A bonus in my book!
B0077PBPJ6|3.0|Maybe it was a mistake to view this right after being immersed in \\"Downton Abbey\\". Same time period. Same Masterpiece Classic presentation. Same Battle of the Somme. But the comparisons end there. As the plot explains, Steven, a young man working for a callous factory owner in France falls in love with Isabelle, the owner's wife. The story jumps back and forth between their illicit tryst in 1910 to the horrors of trench warfare in 1916 where Steven is now a junior officer in the British Army.<br /><br />The initial sequences are what lag the most. Despite the obvious attractiveness of the couple, Steven and Isabelle both seem oddly allergic to words. Instead, there are long loving gazes, long anguished gazes, long questioning gazes. They exchange about ten words between them, half of them inaudible. It is here that one misses the rich conversational wit, compassion and swordplay of \\"Downton Abbey\\". Isabelle abruptly disappears (we later find out why), Steven is left in torment despite having Isabelle's willing sister, Jeanne at his disposal.<br /><br />The actions picks up during the World War I segments as it is obvious the Brits are still haunted by July 1, 1916, the day they lost 20,000 men in one day during the catastrophic Battle of the Somme. The blasted expanse of No-Man's Land is an exact replica of the one used in both \\"Downton Abbey\\" and \\"War Horse\\" which makes you wonder if it is a space specifically rented out for WWI movies. But the scenes of battle are unsparing and horribly graphic. Steven is assigned to a tunneling outfit, the \\"Sewer Rats\\" and forms a friendship of sorts with Jack Firebrace, a solid workingman who is suffering from the loss of his young son. Jack's poignancy helps mitigate Steven's wallowing self-pity as well as reminding him that love is the only thing that matters, a lesson that Steven will need to utilize to become a full man.<br /><br />Steven and Isabelle reunite briefly during a lull in the fighting but I found myself not caring. I had enough of their doe-eyed gazes which lack chemistry and tension. I was more intrigued if Steven would man up and take responsibility for those others who have come into his life (I am avoiding spoilers here!).<br /><br />Overall, \\"Birdsong\\" was a small disappointment, only worth watching if there's nothing else available.g. I had enough of their doe-eyed gazes which lack chemistry and tension.

1475143389|5.0|I really like Mike's take on health overall. This book doesn't have any of the fluff that you see in a lot of other health and fitness guides. He admits that it won't be easy but that it is worth it and gives a lot of great tips to stay at it and get in better shape. Everything is backed up by hard, logical science instead of obscure studies. All sorts of good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am addicted to this game! It is so fun! I would recommend this game to anyone!! Get it!!! You will love it!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I read this book in about 3 days. For me that is fast... light speed actually. I loved it from beginning to end. It is a story of redemption, faith and exceptionalism. Makes me proud to be an American. What a land that can produce such amazing people! It is one of the best military books I have read and one of the best books period. Adam definitely bore fruit... wish I could have met the guy.
0307730697|4.0|I knew it was coming, but I cried anyway. Over the course of a couple hundred pages, I grew to love and respect the character of Adam Brown, as well as his wife Kelley, whose part in this story is impressive in its own right. Though I knew from the moment I opened the book that Adam would not make it to the final page, I wept almost uncontrollably in my bed as Kelley and her children were told the news her husband - their father - had been killed in action. They were tears of pain for Kelley and they were tears of joy for the hope and peace that Adam was welcomed into after a life of military and personal warfare.<br /><br />Fearless is the biographical account of Adam Brown, a Navy SEAL who was killed in combat in the mountains of Afghanistan just two years ago. A member of SEAL  Team SIX, a group forever etched in history as the men who took down Osama Bin Laden, Adam Brown was described by all who knew him as truly fearless. Even more powerful, perhaps, is that his fearlessness was matched only by his selflessness. He truly was a soldier and a servant, in every sense of the words.<br /><br />If Adam's story was only about the road to becoming a Navy SEAL and the ultimate sacrifice he paid while serving his country, then it would still be worth reading. But this story is so much deeper. And so much darker. When Adam - a guy everyone loved and who once had the whole world at his fingertips - fell into a spiral of drug addiction and pushed away any attempt at help, it seemed that prison or death were the most probable outcomes.<br /><br />Thanks to his faith in a risen Savior, the love of a beautiful woman, and the prayers of his desperate parents, Adam found new purpose in his life with the Navy SEALS; his exploits in training and on the battle field are the stuff of a feel-good Hollywood movie. Adam seemed to recognize that while he was alive, but, even so, was convinced that the most important part of his story was the fact that he had been redeemed from a life of utter brokenness. As one of his comrades stated, \\"He must have known he'd be a hero if he were killed in action, but he gave the go-ahead to humble himself, to let the world see those skeletons in his closet, to share his testimony.\\"<br /><br />Fearless is a great story - a truly inspiring testimony that everyone should hear. While I found Blehm's writing style to be rather lackluster, Adam's story practically tells itself. I am glad Blehm believed in  it and did the work of researching all the perspectives of Adam's impact, especially since so many of the men telling the story were tragically killed just months ago. We are almost guaranteed to meet Adam in a movie about SEAL Team Six and the Bin Laden mission, but I truly hope that a talented and passionate screenwriter translates Adam's story to the big screen. It is a story of hope and faith and pain and demons that people need to hear.f utter brokenness.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|simply amazing. This app has kept all my random post its and similar stuff organized. It's been a life saver since I downloaded it.
B005D5EYHW|4.0|When Audible.com offered BossyPants for free, I thought it would be a good opportunity to finally give audio books a chance. The book itself is hysterical. It's smartly written, as you would expect from Tina Fey, and offers a lot of insight into her younger years and the events that shaped her career. Having it read by Ms. Fey herself was an unexpected and delightful bonus! It was great to hear her words in her own voice, they way she wanted everyone to hear them. The book sounded great (on my Kindle Fire) and went by really fast during my commute.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't been into reading for a while until I kept seeing friends of mine talking about this book. I bought the book for kindle and read it within 2 days. AMAZINGLY ADDICTIVE is all I can say!! I just finished the last of the trilogy and I want more!!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I felt like I was in a Jason Bourne adventure except that Jason was a lot more savvy and Will (main character) has a sassy, jaded 14 year old tagging along (do kids really talk/act this way?) The book was well written (what is it with the typos in just about every book I've read lately??) but the plot has a few holes. Suspend your sense of logic and it's a decent read.
B007SGM084|3.0|hmmmm...how to describe?  It is enjoyable to read, the sex becomes predictable in all three books, a little overdone.  The story line though is interesting.  Beginning to feel like an X rated tween series though at the end of the third book.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|Let me see if I can frame my remarks in a positive way. I felt the soundtrack from \\"Prometheus\\" was wholly forgettable. By that I mean I didn't find a discordant note in the film. Marc Streitenfeld's score blended with the action on screen quite well. So much so, I didn't even notice it. It did, however, leave me with a very moody, haunting feeling. Now that I've listened to the soundtrack on CD, I do remember the different tracks. It grows on you like a facehugger. And even though \\"Love the One You're With\\" is not part of the movie's soundtrack, it is worth noting Stephen Stills' song here. You'll have to see \\"Prometheus.\\"
B007R41E8O|4.0|Nice graphics and a good challenging game. Thought it would be a bit spookier but did not mind that it is not.
0764197843|5.0|The material I used is very useful.  When I wrote the actual toeic test, I found it was easier compare to the Barron's.  Barron's practical test really helped me a lot.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Unlike a lot of other Rush fans, I really did not care for Snakes & Arrows. In fact, I thought it was one of the worst albums that the band had released. One of the things that I've always loved about Rush is that they are able to take incredibly complex musicianship and thoughtful lyrics and write them into a song that still has a great melody and hook. They seemed to have lost that ability on Snakes and Arrows, with the exception of \\"Far Cry.\\" Honestly, Vapor Trails before it wasn't a whole lot better in that department either, and really only about half of Test for Echo was good.<br /><br />I was excited for the new release, as I am with every new Rush album, but based on their recent track record, I was skeptical as well. I was hoping that playing Moving Pictures on their Time Machine tour would inspire newfound creativity in the band that would show up on the new album, much like how revisiting past great albums might have helped inspire Our Lady Peace on their newest release.<br /><br />Admittedly, I will still need some listens with Clockwork Angels to fully appreciate the album, and so far I seem to be enjoying it a bit more with each listen. However, I feel 4 out of 5 stars is a pretty accurate rating for this album. It's not great, but it is a very solid effort. I think it oversteps the previous three albums that I had mentioned above. Rush definitely seems to have found and channeled new inspiration in writing and recording this album. The individual performances by the band members are the best that they've been in a long time, and the album as a whole sounds cohesive and inspired.<br /><br />Song by song:<br /><br />1. Caravan (7/10) - This song is a very cool opener to the album. Musically, there are a lot of ideas in this song and a lot going on. This is a heavy song with plenty of complex transitions and time signature changes. My complaint with this song is that the melodies are not very strong or memorable. This is a good song, not a great song.<br />2. BU2B (10/10) - Great song. This song is heavy and driving. This song is the first proof on this album that Rush can still churn out a memorable hook. When the song comes out of the bridge section and goes into the final chorus, I can't help but say \\"Yeah!\\" Lyrically, I think this song has the double effect of advancing the story and also being a bit personal to Neil.<br />3. Clockwork Angels (4/10) - Musically, this song sounds a lot more like the Rush of the 70s and early 80s. Like Caravan, this song has its share of complexities and interesting transitions. Again, though, the melodies in this song are just not very strong.<br />4. The Anarchist (10/10) - This is probably the best mix of Rush's older sound meeting their newer sound. It's a heavy, driving song with a great hook and some very cool guitar and bass riffs. There is also an excellent middle-eastern sounding solo from Alex. Like BU2B, this song is just fun to listen to.<br />5. Carnies (3/10) - This song starts off with a great guitar riff reminiscent of \\"Working Man.\\" The problem with this song is that even now that I've listened to it a few times, I still can't tell what part is actually supposed to be the chorus. The hook in this song is incredibly weak, if there is one at all. Musically, though, it is a cool song.<br />6. Halo Effect (6/10) - This semi-ballad that features the acoustic guitar in the verses is a breath of fresh air after the heavier, faster, complex songs that dominate the first half of the album. It is a nice, melodic song. It feels like it should lead somewhere else, though, like the song wants to lead you into this great hook that it just doesn't do.<br />7. Seven Cities of Gold (7/10) - This song finds a cool groove and features some good guitar riffs. This is another fun song to listen to. Geddy proves that he can still belt out the high notes.<br />8. The Wreckers (10/10) - Whoa, where did this one come from?! This is probably Rush's most melodic sounding song since \\"Nobody's Hero.\\" Dear Roadrunner Records: Release this song as a single.<br />9. Headlong Flight (9/10) - This is another song that throws back to Rush's earlier sound. All around very good song with a good hook and a shredding solo from Alex.<br />10. BU2B2 (5/10) - This is more of a transition song that brings reintroduces the theme from the first BU2B track.<br />11. Wish Them Well (7/10) - This is a pretty rocking track with a decent hook. Geddy hits some notes in the background toward the end of the song that I did not think he was still capable of hitting.<br />12. The Garden (9/10) - This is another left field song. It is a lengthy, melodic ballad to end the album. The final two minutes of this song are entrancing, and a great way to end the album.<br /><br />Ultimately, I doubt that I will regard this album in the same class that classics like Moving Picture, Permanent Waves, or 2112 are in, but this is definitely a very solid album, and a pleasant surprise for someone who was not expecting a whole lot.<br /><br />---------<br />UPDATE<br />---------<br /><br />After having allowed this album to sink in for a couple more weeks, I am ready to update my previous review. I stand by my initial reaction to the album of it being about a 4-star album. I could tell that I would most likely enjoy it more with each listen, but really, what is the point of posting a review of this album several weeks after its release? Rush fans [like myself] are going to pick this up in its first week. The album did not jump out to me like it did to some of the reviewers who posted 5-star reviews. I did really like it, but I still saw flaws.<br /><br />Now that the album has sunk in for a couple weeks, I have grown to really love this album. It truly does get better with each listen, and even the areas that I had complained about above do not seem so glaring anymore, especially in the grand scheme of the album as a whole. I am editing this review and changing my rating of 4-stars to 5-stars (assuming Amazon lets me do that).<br /><br />As I stated above, I look for a good mix of complexity and melody in Rush's music. The prog rock fan in me enjoys the complexity of the songs; the hard rock fan in me enjoys the heavy songs; and the general music fan in me looks for a good melody and a catchy hook. One of Rush's biggest problems over the last couple of albums is that they haven't been writing very good melodies or hooks. With the first couple listens of Clockwork Angels, I could tell that this album was a vast improvement in that category over their last few, but it still left a lot to be desired. Now that I have listened to it a lot (and I do mean A LOT), many of the melodies and hooks that I found initally to have not been very strong have been embedded in my head. Assuming that I am able to change the rating of this review, this will now be a 5-star review, as I am confident in saying that this album is in my top-5 by the band.<br /><br />Also, in case you're wondering, I'll update my song-by-song rating as well:<br />Caravan - 8/10<br />BU2B - 10/10<br />Clockwork Angels - 9/10<br />The Anarchist - 10/10<br />Carnies - 8/10<br />Halo Effect - 7/10<br />Seven Cities of Gold - 10/10<br />The Wreckers - 10/10<br />Headlong Flight - 10/10<br />BU2B2 - N/A<br />Wish Them Well - 8/10<br />The Garden - 10/10's Hero.\\" Dear Roadrunner Records: Release this song as a single.<br />9.

B007Z9QWVK|5.0|Beautifully woven story between the past and the present.  Abbie Cornish delivered an impeccable interpretation of her character.  Andrea Riseborough was magnificent as Wallace Simpson.  The music, cinematography and costuming were excellent.  Madonna brought her own signature creativity to this film.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is fond of period pieces.

B005M0R524|3.0|Started watching the series on Netflix and wanted to continue with season 2.  Obviously, the set has season 2 ... but it is missing the Christmas Special from season 2 (that's one missing brick).  Also, the audio is weak (brick number two).  Every other disc I've gotten in blu-ray has given me great audio in my 7.1 audio setup.  This only delivers 3.1 and feels rather flat.
B00729GQ0A|2.0|The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton is the first book in the Forever Girl series. I have to say that I'm not crazy about this book. I really had to struggle to get through it. I kept hoping that as I continued to read that it would pull me into its story. It didn't. I will say that this book had an interesting take on vampires, witches and shape shifters. It is a very unique perspective of the paranormal world.<br /><br />The story begins with Sophia trying to find your place in her community and life. She is a practicing Wiccan and is constantly harassed by the local fundamental Christians, which includes her mother. On top of the harassment, she constantly is hearing a buzz. To get rid of the buzz, she performs a positive energy ritual to dispel the noise. Instead of helping, the noises change into voices and get worse Sophia's calls it her \\"curse.\\" The importance of her \\"curse\\" slowly (and I mean slowly) unveils itself in the story. I'm still unclear about the source of the voices. . My first issue was that it was not explained why the ritual unleashed more power. I had a hard time connecting the dots on why the ritual set certain things into motion. Sometimes I felt that some explanations were dumped on me in a haphazard way and it was difficult to understand how it relates to the overall series story.<br /><br />There are several characters introduced in this book.  Sophia's romantic interest is Charles. I found their relationship very uninteresting. I was not able to experience the buildup of their relationship. All of a sudden they were in love with really no development.  Sophia's close friend is Ivory. I have to say Ivory is a bizarre character. Her relationship with Sophia was really unexpected and, to me, didn't really fit with the story. It wasn't uncomfortable; I just felt it was out-of-place. I had a very hard time connecting with these characters. To me, there was a real lack of character depth and development. Sophia's attachment to these characters wasn't really fleshed out enough. There was many times where I was scratching my head wondering why?<br /><br />Sophia's family issues were only, I felt, marginally touched upon. You don't actually meet her father who Sophia seems to have a good relationship. It took me almost the entire book to figure out that her parents were still married. The way it was described I thought Sophia came from a broken home. It was really hard to grasp the family dynamic. Why did Sophia turn to the Wiccan practices? Was it due to her family pain or due to otherworldly reasons? More explanation of how the Wiccan religion actually affected Sophia's life would have been appreciated. I didn't really get that she was a devoted practicing Wiccan.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, but in the end, I just couldn't. My main overall problem was that I found the relationships to be under-developed and difficult to relate to. I hope that the next book in the series has more character development and depth.wasn't really fleshed out enough.

1936608898|5.0|Having also read pretty much every nutrition based book on the market at this point, I was curious how the Hartwigs would add something new to the deluge of information available. What they've done in It Starts With Food is to simply removed the dogmatic Paleo or Vegan or Low Carb nonsense and focus on what the science tells us, asking simply \\"Does consuming this food make you more healthy or less healthy?\\" - wonderfully straight forward.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|This movie is one of only two movies that I bought without first seeing.  And I'm so happy I did.<br />In addition to Matt Damon and Emily Blunt (the perfectly believable soulmates), there is an outstanding supporting cast, especially Anthony Mackie and John Slattery. I liked George Nolfi's allusions to religion and spirituality. It wasn't heavy, just enough to make viewers think. There were great comedic elements to the film which balanced these serious themes.  I highly recommend it!

B0052T7ICM|5.0|This album represents a true gem, fulfilled with a vast collection of Rock tunes that are memorable. Ted McKenna and Jerry McAvoy sound so brilliant (drums and bass resp.) and so tight as the platform where Rory's guitar and songs are built. This is an authentic power trio, Rory wanted that, he got rid of the piano player (Martin) and the other drummer (De Ath) and kept McAvoy and hired McKenna (ex Sensational Alex Harvey Band)for this album. The opening track is just a little taste of what the whole album will sound as \\"Shin Kicker\\" is a fast rocking song, followed by the incredible \\"Brute force and ignorance\\" that is one of the greatest Rock songs I've ever heard, with a slide solo at the end that gives a bluesy sound to the song. \\"Over night bag\\" is a great song, very solid as well. \\"Fuel to the fire\\" is a great ballad with an emotional solo at the very end.Not to mention \\"Shadow play\\", \\"Last of the Independents\\" and \\"Cruise on\\" . Whatever I might say I will still be short on what this albums represents in quality, what Rock and Roll  truly is, fun.

B006RUJST6|4.0|Really enjoyed this quick read! Loved the slam poetry, and the story line.  I gave four stars because I agree with another reviewer about Kel's age being wrong (does not act like a 9 year old) and also a few other mistakes throughout the book.  However this did not take away from the story and I would definitely recommend this book!
B005LJETYI|5.0|This novel is compelling and fast paced.  I read it in one sitting.<br /><br />The author incorporates many elements veteran science fiction readers will be familiar with: mechs and temporal dislocation, all wrapped in a  coming of age tale.  There is also at least one really interesting Big Idea, but I won't spoil it here.  I also liked that the characters were believable, and that the pacing fit the narrative arc.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this novel to anyone who has an interest in military SF, and I'm looking forward to reading some more of this author's work.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|\\"Prometheus\\" is visually breathtaking, with a number of spectacular special effects, which would be even more breathtaking in 3D. It boasts two very talented actresses: Noomi Rapace, Lispeth Salander in the Millenium Trilogy, and Charlize Theron.  Viewers will recognize the alien spaceship, the command chair, and helmeted alien from the first Alien movie. The story, however, suffers from any number of ambiguities. I will accept a certain number of ambiguities, but the motivations of the characters should be reasonably understandable.  Kubrick achieved this in his masterpiece, \\"2001, a Space Odyssey\\". In that film, the meaning of the monolith and the Louis XVI bedroom are left to the viewer's imagination, but there was never any doubt about the character's motivations. In \\"Prometheus\\", what was the significance of the opening scene in which a character consumes some liquid, undergoes physical changes, and dies? What was his motivation? Why did the android put his finger with a drop of oily-looking fluid in the man's drink? What did he know? How did the crew come to understand so quickly that the canisters on the alien spaceship were WMD's targeted for earth? How did Dr. Shaw believe that the aliens had decided not to annihilate the the earth? One may infer that they all knew something, but whatever it was, I must have missed it. On other hand, this seems to have been the most intellectually challenged crews in the history of the genre.  A self-important creature feature.
0345803507|4.0|The last of the trilogy.  Was sorry it ended.  Left me wanting more.<br />Maybe the subject matter was growing on me...<br />Would still like to know how the author did \\"research\\" for the books.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Another long time VH lover, that got weary of SH's tired voice. And OMG, Eddie and (oh, what was the Jewish guy's name--just kidding--D.L.Roth, sounded better than ever--heaven, only knows what kept his voice, in such terrific shape)  I hope they both outlive me, because I don't know if I could live without them.
1936608898|5.0|The best book on nutrition written!! As the proud owner of over 25 fad- diet books, I can atest to this book being the best! It is black and white. It's like they are in your head and know how you/ I think about food. It's crazy! They break each section up to make it not only easy to read, but easy to follow. And, with the real life senarios and testimonials, I found it very relatable to my own life.<br />I am just finishing up my third WHOLE30 and I feel amazing. They really outlined a great plan and gave me all the details on what to expect (from the good and the bad). They really helped me overcome my unhealthy relationship with food. I know look at food in a different light. I want to eat food that will make me healthier, not tired, stressed or sick.<br />People, buy this book. Again, read the second sentence in this review and TRUST ME!! I'm serious. This book will change your life and your realtionship with food.
B003QSMCKO|1.0|We watched the movie on the computer.  The image was pretty good, but something was wrong with the sound.  Even with the volume turned up to maximum level on the computer, we could barely hear the sound.
0446604844|4.0|After the disappointing \\"True Blue,\\" it was nice to read another Baldacci thriller that fills the bill again.  Sidney and Jeffrey Archer are your typical upwardly mobile couple, raising their little daughter Amy.  Jeffrey works for a technology company, Sidney (yes, she's a girl) is a corporate attorney.  Jeffrey has been doing some mysterious stuff after hours but the plane in which he is flying to LA mysteriously crashes, killing nearly 200 people.  On the day of Jeffrey's memorial service, Sydney receives a phone call...from Jeffrey...which sets a non-stop thriller in motion that ultimately goes off in so many directions it's sometimes hard to keep up.  There is corporate greed, a sex scandal, double identities, sociopaths, chases, gun battles, people sneaking around in dark office buildings.  It's a thriller you can't put down.
0143119680|1.0|This is the kind of book where the hero is a \\"wine expert\\" because he serves Dom Perignon champagne to the heroine.  All the sympathetic characters get back stories of how nobly they behaved, and how much they were acclaimed, in various historical eras, while the sneering villain practically twirls his mustachios.  Every fireplace has a \\"cheery\\" blaze and everyone's sight and hearing are \\"keen.\\"  I'n not sure which I disliked more:  the heroine's annoying hand-wringing over her inescapable witchly heritage, or the wannabe snobbery of the author's descriptions of Oxford college life, the hero's Jaguar, stately home, wine cellar, etc.  What a disappointment.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|You may notice that I omitted \\"animation\\" in the title, because I don't compare it to other animation movies. Kids might be drawn to it because of the rich animation. But the soul of the movie is the story, which only adults can truly appreciate.<br /><br />The movie is funny, inspiring and heart-warming. And no, you don't need to like cooking or even food to love this movie, because in the end, it's about friendship, family and most importantly, finding the courage to be who you are, even when nobody else believes in you.<br /><br />This little rat who wanted to be a chef taught us a lesson about life.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice layout and Simple design with excellent basic features. I like the tape feature. Great addition to my Kindle Fire apps.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|A must read for women of all age's, not for the prudish but this is some author can't wait till she write's something along the same line's. Loved all 3 book's and in fact read them again, She is the talk of the world....About time that someone wrote what most women fantisise about.....\\"LOVED IT \\"
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is the most AWESOMEST game in the world! its really fun and I enjoy the monkey-like-things. I REALLY love this game!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out on Kindle Fire and I when I saw it, I was soooo excited. Of you don't have a lot of clutter on your Kindle, it will operate wonderfully!
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Being a long time guitar player, and Megadeth being my favorite band, I look at them differently than most \\"non guitar\\" players. Their chops are getting more furious, more complex, more melodic, and more versatile, etc. I remember reading an article right after Dave's unfortunate incident with his hand, and after Dave recovered, he told the magazine (Revolver, I think) that \\"bands now days are not taking the time to really learn their craft\\". That is why I say Megadeth are getting better and better. They are not putting out albums to just put out albums. They put a lot of work into their \\"craft\\". The latest album, Th1rt3en is one their greatest albums yet, musically speaking.<br /><br />For hardcore Megadeth fans, you can see how their music is evolving. When United Abominations came out, \\"Washington is Next\\" became my favorite Megadeth song. But with Th1rt3en, \\"Black Swan\\" is my new favorite. Though all of their songs jam, there are usually a few songs that really stick out, and usually one song that really hits me the first time I hear it. Black Swan was that song on Th1rt3en. 13 is also one of those songs that really bring it home. Sudden Death has some sick guitar work and amazing solos! After the main solo, the way they bring it back into the Chorus is just grabbing! I mean, I want to slam the walls. This album is up there with the rest of the great ones.<br /><br />By the way, Youthanasia is still my favorite album overall.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|SHERLOCK HOLMES:  A GAME OF SHADOWS, is a shining exception to the Sequel Law.  (Sequel Law:  They suck.)  In this highly entertaining second offering, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law take their reprised roles as Holmes and Watson to a higher level; they're grittier, more developed, deliciously nuanced, and even funnier.  As much as I enjoyed the original 'Sherlock Holmes', I liked the second installment even more.  (And here's hoping there's one more installment to complete the trifecta; such a box set would be a must-own in our DVD collection.)<br /><br />There is a core group of four actors who make this exciting, high flying adventure such grand fun:  Downey and Law, of course, along with Jared Harris as the brilliant-yet-evil Professor Moriarity (a most formidable and dangerous adversary for Holmes), and Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's eccentric older brother (who is hysterically funny).  There is plenty comedic relief here, from Watson's honeymoon train ride going awry, to quite the ostentatious bachelor party, to Mycroft making a most memorable entrance to Watson's blushing bride (Kelly Reilly).  And it's a good thing there are bountiful humorous moments, because there is a dark side to this film, epitomized by Moriarity's cunning evil, which sets the stage for some unbelievably astonishing action and special effects.  Director Guy Ritchie and his crew cut no corners here, and it shows; this is a white-knuckle thriller that promises to have you squirming in your seat.  It's entertaining indeed to watch Holmes and Watson attempt to thwart a world war, with an open ending that hints at least one more installment in this franchise is coming our way.  And will this reviewer enjoy such a development?  Elementary, my dear Watson!<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have followed Rush faithfully since 1980. Clockwork Angels is the most spirited effort since that era. As a fellow musician I am still amazed by their musicianship. If you have never seen them live don't miss out
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I am 41 and have been a fan of The Beach Boys and Brian Wilson since I was a kid and I admit I have very LOW expectations for the new album when I heard it was being recorded.....I was wrong...VERY wrong.<br />This is better than Brian's much lauded solo debut in 1988 and better than anything the Beach Boys have recorded since \\"Love You\\" in the seventies.  Maturity, great instrumentations, great lyrics and a wonderful sound all around.  Two thumbs up.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|If you have doubts, lay them aside, pick up this album.  If you don't have any doubts, then what are you waiting for?? This album is amazing, all the more so for the fact that these guys are no spring chickens anymore.  They are not resting on their laurels, but pushing ahead.  Yippee!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|It's a great movie. I loved the Avengers movie that I saw in the theater and Capt. America was a prelude movie. I enjoyed learning the history of capt. America.

0345803493|3.0|This book is 50 times getter than Grey. Why ? 50 reasons at least.<br /><br />Here is the link > http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F6BU9TRSYJB7/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615334601&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br /><br />Much more realistic than fantasy.
0345803507|5.0|Loved reading the 3 books.  For me there was more than sex...there is a story behind that about 2 people and how they change their lifes.  I hope people will see through that and pick up the book and give it a chance.  Yes, it takes over your life because you don't want to put it down.  The details of the books help you..they make you feel like your there..you can see what is going on.<br />I enjoyed all 3 books.  I was disappointed at the end of 3.  It was good don't get me wrong but...I can't say because I don't want others knowing before they have the chance to read it.  Just sad because you are really into it and...Then you realize most likely...and wishing that would have come later in another book.<br />Now that I'm done with all 3 books, I'm a little lost because they did take over my life for 2 weeks.  It was a good 2 week though.  Every time I walked away I couldn't wait to read more.  The books offer so much...laughter, danger, sad (makes you cry), sex, eye's opening, etc...something is always happening-never a dull moment.<br />IV read people talking about Mr. Grey how every women will want a Mr. Grey and he' not out there or getting their hopes up..well of course we wish we had a Mr. Grey--maybe not all of Mr. Grey for me but he is so good to Ana for the most part.  We are adults and know we won't have a Mr. Grey-wish your husband was more like him but...that isn't \\"real\\" in most cases.<br />It's still worth reading.  I hope there is more to come.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have read all the hateful comments about this book, and it's very sad that we live in a world full of haters who can't either find something kind to say or just keep your comments to yourself.  This is a perfect example of \\"media hype\\".  Don't aim your negative comments toward the author of this book - aim it at the media.  Once the media gets ahold of a product or story, they are like a dog with a bone.  Most people in this world are looking for a negative energy force to latch onto so that they can condone their own miserable mediocre lives.  At least this author had the courage to step out of her comfort zone (after successfully raising her family) to follow her passion.  Everyone is not going to like her product (that's life).  But if you already see that someone has voiced a negative comment, why must thousands of you jump on the bandwagon behind it?  And why are you listening to the media and following their hypnotic suggestions of what to read?  Maybe now you realize that the media has a job to do and so do you, and YOUR job is to think for yourself and stop allowing them to influence your purchase choices!  And try to find positive energy forces to follow.  Congrats to the author for following her dream!!!
B0049OSQ18|4.0|This cd arrived really fast. It was exactly what I expected after seeing The Decemberists featured on Austin City Limits.

B003YCI1PM|2.0|This was supposed to be a new CD, but the manufacturer's tape was missing.  Also, the CD case was broken.  The disc was in good shape, but this should not have been sold as a new product.
B001B7CNY2|5.0|On Blu Ray, U-571 confirms just how good Blu Ray can be.  The video is sparkling clear without grain in even the darkest of scenes.  The video transfer was simply excellent.  However, it is the audio transfer to DTS-HD Master Audio that is the factor that really stands out.  There are rarely any Blu Rays that you will find where the audio in 5.1 is so beautifully used.  The directionality of the discreet channels whether front left or right or the rear channels is simply amazing, it is a true demo DVD for the audio of your system.  Whether there is an explosion to the right front, a glass spilling at the left rear, water pouring in around you,..this disc leaves you in the middle of it all.  Make sure your sub woofer is set properly as it will get a good workout.  Remember that if you hear your sub as a separate speaker, it is set too loud; sub bass is non directional.<br /><br />The only negative, if you want to call it that, is that while the Standard DVD version came with a DTS audio choice and was a well made DVD( I have this as well) the Blu Ray version left out all the extras that were available on the Standard version.  Only the director's commentary remains.  In this case, it is a shame as the extras on the Standard version were historically interesting and very worthy of inclusion which I personally find not to be the case with a great many 'extras'.<br /><br />Apologies to those who are only interested in book report summaries of the plot and judgements on the acting.  I'm not that guy and you can find storyboard summaries in probably most of the other reviews.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B004IJY4L0|5.0|I listen to lots of music and this is one of the really good ones from the past few years.  Give it a try...
B000ICLRHK|4.0|I have the Standard Def 5 Star Version of Speed and thought I'd pick up the Blu Ray version.  The Standard Def version did have DTS 5.1 audio which is rare on regular DVDs and that version was really quite good.  So what could I expect with the Blu Ray version. For one thing, the audio is DTS HD loss less and does a credible job of tracking movement though out the sound stage.  There are times when the musical part of the audio overwhelms what may have been discreet channeling of the various foley effects but I did not find that too bothersome.  The audio here is quite good but unless you have a really fine home theater set up, I do not think you will hear much difference between the two versions.<br /><br />The video transfer is excellent with no observable grain or artifacting.  Then again, the SD version was almost as good if not equal in my opinion.<br /><br />For those interested in extras, the 2 disc standard version had plenty of good extras aside from the standard commentary.  The making of the bus jumping scene was a thrill to see.  On the Blu Ray version, other than the commentary, there really are no extras.  There is a very silly game included that bored me after the first try or two.  How they can call Scene Selection an 'Extra' is beyond my understanding.  There are no deleted or extended scenes.<br /><br />If you don't already have the film on DVD than, certainly, the Blu Ray is the one to get, but if you already own the 2 disc set I do not believe that you will get a significant difference in quality in the upgrade.<br /><br />For those interested in the story line and acting..you can't beat Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock is still a budding star.  Kneau Reeves in this pre Matrix film gets his feet wet as the action hero.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksrchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Great Movie to see.  It's about a young men trying to figure out what he wants in life, what he needs in life and what he has to do in life. Shipping was fast, and on time. [[ASIN:B0013D8LCW Shelter]]
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read many \\"just for Kindle\\" books that vary from terrible to pretty good.  This one ranks as excellent.  A major publisher should pick this up and get it into wider release.  And, wow, what a movie it would make.
0345803493|1.0|I read the 1st book out of pure curiosity, from all the reviews. Was a little grossed out at times; but decided to give the 2nd a try, hoping for the better.  There is not much of a story line; just redundant cheap porn. Very disappointed in some of the 5 star reviews. I understand this is fiction, but how does this depict us as women? That we all secretly want to be submissive, self loathing, no-brains; that yearns for the approval and desire from some freak that was abused as a child?<br /> \\"Oh, Fifty-my Fifty; you scare me\\" \\"Please shove that up my ass and tell me you love me\\"... CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.<br />How many High School Girls do you think have snagged their mom's copy of this book; to see what the fuss is all about? Are they reading this believing they need to de-grade themselves to win a boy over? We are supposed to be uplifting and empowering other women. And encouraging our young ladies to ACT like young ladies! This is not love.<br />Oh, and realistically; how many women have THAT much great sex and orgasm instantly? A Woman did not write this book!
B000X2H8G4|5.0|This product works good except it's not powerful enough to replace my hearing aids. It picks up all noises like fans running which takes away from it's effectiveness.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Bought the 2d Blu-Ray the other day and watched it.  IT ROCKS!!  I really have no understanding of why it did so poorly in the theaters.  For something that was based off of a book from the early 1900's this is an amazing story.  It had a good balance of fight scenes and dialog that kept you wanting to know more.  By the end of the movie all I could think of is Good grief I hope they make a sequel as I need to know more.<br /><br />So don't listen to any critics out there buy/rent/download this movie it is quite a ride.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good movie overall it is fun and a good way to pass time. I like the challenges it gives you to keep you wanting to play. I am a girl so these are my favorite type of games to play. I'm on my bf account so I know he hares that I am using up all the Internet to do this review.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I am a long time Beach Boys fan and didn't have really high expectations for this album.  I honestly expected to hear a few glimpses of the past Brian Wilson magic.  But, I have to say that this album is easy to listen to and has plenty of the trademark Beach Boys harmonies that will have you singing along.  This is the best thing Brian Wilson has done since his solo album, \\"Imagination\\", but this album is deeper.  I won't do a run down of the album song by song as others have done that but suffice it to say that as one reviewer in a magazine said, these guys sound better at this age than they have a right to.  The cool thing is that the sound is like turning back the clock to the 1970's Beach Boys sound.  If you read the latest edition of Rolling Stone, the background info on the recording of the album is fascinating.  Brian was of course in complete control of the recordings and only he knew which tracks would make the album.  Something like 28 tracks were recorded, so hopefully some of the others will be released in the future.  There is even a track with a vocal previously done by the late Carl Wilson.(This track did not make this album).  While I am thrilled with the album and recommend it highly, I can't help but think what might have been for the last 30 years if Brian had kept his sanity and if the band had not quibbled and fought.  Oh well, we better enjoy this one because if it is the last new Beach Boys record, it is fitting and really well done.
0802130208|5.0|Humorous, absurd, engaging, impossible yet believable (just barely), this is an amazingly zany and entertaining novel. The immensely egotistical Ignatius J. Reilly of New Orleans, Louisiana, sees himself out of place in the 20th century and lets everyone around him know about it.<br /><br />The cast of characters includes his long-suffering mother Irene Reilly, activist and philosophical counterpoint Myrna Minkoff, bar owner and pornographic photo star Lana Lee and especially the very funny janitor/vagrant Burma Jones, along with many other unique and memorable characters.<br /><br />Ignatius J. Reilly is thrown into the job market by his mother to help pay for damages they inflicted on a building with their automobile while arguing. The lead-up to that event opens the story and is a comedy in itself. As an employee, Ignatius turns every engagement into a wild ride until he gets predictably fired. The situations are zany yet not quite fantastic enough to dismiss.<br /><br />The dialogue is continuous, unpredictable and downright funny. The phrasing, the New Orleans dialect, the hilariously contrasting viewpoints of identical situations by those characters present, all combine to surprise and entertain from cover to cover.<br /><br />A unique aspect of plot development is the way scenes are portrayed and reader's focus is shifted from one to the next simultaneous event. The author paints excellent visual images of places and people that make one feel as though you are witness to a Broadway play or a television sitcom.<br /><br />I tried to rate this a 4-star book, but cannot think of any reason to deduct that fifth star. So 5-star it is.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love playing this game, however the app won't  even open on my Android tablet. Can someone please offer me some help with this issue. :(
B005LAIHKY|5.0|Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are joined at the hip. Of all their movies this one is THE BEST. I came home from the theater and tried to buy the DVD. I have never done that before.<br /><br />Seeing is believing. So watch it for yourself and decide.
B00845PT18|2.0|I was waiting for this to come out to watch and I wanted to buy it before it came available for rent and I'm glad I did not. I love Nic Cage but the story, the movie, everything in this movie is not up the expectations I had from the first one. And I have to say the first one was better, way better. Make of it what you want, but for all the fans of Nic Cage I would recommend to rent this and than decide if this is the kind of movie you want to spend your money on to have it in your movie library. Two stars are only because I really like Cage. But otherwise would give it one star.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Prometheus of mythology brought fire and changed the world. Prometheus of Ridley Scott brought \\"ehh\\" and occupied me for a few hours.<br /><br />Are there some stunning visuals? Sure, enough for PC slideshow, but not a whole movie. And please, can we broaden the color palate just a tad? I mean I saw Minority Report, I'm ready for more than blue-grey.<br /><br />The story has interesting moments and some big-ish ideas, but not a lot more than a re-run of \\"In Search of ...\\".<br /><br />And if you can remove characters from the movie without leaving any real absence, you should. Sorry Vickers, you're out of here. (\\"But she has a difficult relationship with her father!\\" Wow, high drama.)<br /><br />OK, some fun, some cool graphics, but the sum of the original Thing from Another Planet (similar alien confrontation), 2001 a Space Oddity (Have some Champagne, Dave), Alien, last King Kong (bug attack), and other sci-fi films and TV shows does not a classic make. Just more derivative fodder.<br /><br />Addition: I just have to add that for all of it's weaknesses, and it had MANY, I think Event Horizon did a better job of drawing interesting characters and tension than Prometheus. Ouch.
B0088W7KM8|2.0|Starts off with one minute of colored bars and varying pitch tones, followed by technical description of the video feed.  The show begins around the 2 minute mark.  But wait, there's more weird stuff.  The \\"commercials\\" haven't been cut out, you get to watch 2:30 minute or 3:00 minute black screen intervals.  Bunch of weird stuff at the end too, but I haven't bothered wasting my time on any of it.  Preview for the next episode, then it sort of replays, but without sound.<br /><br />Overall, I like the series ok, but the presentation is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Remember, the show starts at the 2 minute mark, and you need to fast forward either 2.30 or 3.00 minutes for the commercial breaks.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I can't wait to see where this series goes, and look forward to the next book.  The author does a great job of developing a relationship between the reader and the characters.  He pulls you into the story and you become a witness to the tale.  I will definitely get more of my friends to start this journey.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I love the loose, wheels-half-on-the-track quality of Crazy Horse.  Nothing has to be precise as long as the energy and groove are right.  Several of the tracks on Americana are intense and driving (Oh Susanna, Clementine, She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain, Gallows Pole)and those are the most effective for me.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought Neil wrote Wayfaying Stranger, Travel On, and High Flying Bird.  He makes them sound so personal.  Overall, an amazing album that hasn't left my CD player since it arrived.

Having read the trilogy on my Kindle, I could neither loan or give him my copies. The next best thing was to buy him the gift set which I did, and you know what..............I'm going to purchase another set for myself! This was such an enrapturing series of stories that I must have them for myself! I'm going to put them on my \\"Wish List\\" to start with, just to see if my \\"Fairy Godmother\\" might come through, but regardless................they will be mine!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Having lived in a small Louisiana town in the 70's, I can attest to the accuracy of much of this book. It is written with humor and great insight. The \\"heroine\\" comes to see that eyes will only be opened with a dramatic push. Her book that shows life through the eyes of the \\"black maid\\" is cutting edge for the times. So many of the characters in this book, were very much alive still in the 70's and the mindset was still in place. Excellent read and thought provoking.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|A little bit of everything on this one.<br />I enjoyed the youtube studio videos as well!<br />Now for a U.S.tour?<br /><br />Everything these guys do is always \\"GOLDEN\\"

B005CRQ4XI|1.0|You think you are purchasing a book about a women who \\"heals herself\\" through the courageous trials of the Pacific Trail.  Instead, she shares about the adultry with multiple men during and after her marriage to a wonderful man, drugs, and finally abortion. I say finally, but I could not read past the horrifying 3 chapters as I was hoping the story would get better, sadly did not.<br />We all have our troubled pasts, or difficulties through growing up.  Maybe even difficult moments with family, so much so that they cannot speak to oneanother.  To use that as an excuse to behave in a manner that is completely opposite of what our consciences tell us is the difference between right and wrong is beyond me.<br />Please do not waste your money on this trash!!!
B0049IHX2C|4.0|I don't know why the Movies were in two cd cases, especially the second disc being in a old music cd case, but maybe I could keep it as a soveigner or give it to one of the old folks I talk to at my work.

Those can be found everywhere and frequently contain \\"spoilers\\" or information best left to one's own discovery.<br /><br />\\"The Night Circus\\"  is among the most imaginative books I have read. Like \\"Harry Potter,\\" the author does a remarkable job of creating characters one would like to meet and a venue like none other.<br /><br />The true plot is not easily deciphered. Like Margaret Atwood's novels, one often has to work to discover what is really going on. Even then, many aspects are open to personal interpretation. I still have questions and can't say I'm 100% satisfied.<br /><br />But there are no doubts about this incredible circus. Extensive descriptions can distract me (as in \\"The Tiger's Wife\\").  Here, I couldn't wait until the sun set and I was again led into this fantastic place, past the big clock, through a dark starlit maze, and into another magical tent.  And that's not even mentioning the delicious cocoa, candy apples, popcorn, and cinnamon sticks that literally made my mouth water.<br /><br />This book stimulated my senses and kept my brain in overdrive - in a good way.<br /><br />I have nothing but admiration for this writer, who is truly an artist in every sense of the word.

0385344228|4.0|Courtroom drama, and back story told in this book by the father of Jacob. For those that love courtroom, legal thrillers this is right up your alley. Starts off some what slow but picks up, stick with it you want regret it. I was somewhat surprised by the ending and at the same time saddened by the action taken.
B0073XORCY|4.0|The intent of this collection has already been stated, so no need to rehash. Ian's a brilliant poet, and that ability continues to shine, as does his penchant for mixing it up a little with the key changes in the music. It's also good to hear his voice sounding better than it has in a while, without the straining vocal register he'd struggled with. As the founder, face, voice, and creative backbone of the group, Ian is entirely within his right to change the whole personnel lineup and still call the group Jethro Tull. However ...<br /><br />Martin Barre's unique style is missing, and this missing ambience of the disk somehow makes it all \\"less than Tull\\" to this 40+ year fan ... with all respect to Mr. Opahle. Chemistry is that intangible thing that truly gives a group its sound, and as tightly arranged and skillfully played as this album is, it still doesn't sound quite like Tull to me. It's very good, and the track \\"A Change of Horses\\" is perhaps an obvious statement on Ian's part to move on with his career in a different direction. Without doing extensive calculations, the 400,000 hours refered to would be no exaggeration of the work volume he and Martin did together. And my oh my, those have been great hours and great years.

0425221806|4.0|Of the dozen or so Koontz novels that I've read over the years, this was far and away his best one. Heartfelt, action-packed, and engaging, I simply loved it. It has a little something for everyone. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />~Vlad Vaslyn~<br />Author of Brachman's Underworld<br />[...]
0545123291|3.0|I really wasn't that into this book. I'm not sure what it was exactly that bothered me, but I had a really hard time wanting to read Linger. I vaguely remember feeling the same way about the first book, Shiver. However, I can truly say that I did find myself pretty interested in the plot by the end of the book.<br />I hate that it took so long for this plot to get going. It seemed to drag on for-ev-er. I had to make myself keep reading. Cole and Isabelle really were the only things in the book that held my interest. Sam seemed too emo and Grace was lacking whatever charisma she had in the first book. Actually, Grace and Sam were very Bella and Edward-like in this book. Really annoying. Cole, however, was different. His story is unique and very troubled, which made him a great addition to the story. Of course, Isabelle's troubled nature kept things feisty as well. She was snarky and contemptuous, which helped cut through the overly sappy emotions coming from Sam and Grace. Thank goodness for characters with issues!<br />As I said, the ending was pretty darn good. It definitely has me wondering what will happen next. I went ahead and put in a request for Forever from my library, but I am prepared to send the book back if it starts off the way Linger did. I refuse to suffer through another slow beginning. In fact, I'm prepared to start asking people to give me a run-down of the final book's plot. I have too many other lust-worthy books to read this summer. No time for Twilight repeats.<br />I give Linger a 3 based solely on the ending. Otherwise, this would have been a 2 all the way through.
