B001NLL8LA|4.0|Lee Child scores again! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. No meaningless editorializing like I often find in crime drama type books. No girly fluff, just good solid action. Every word is part of the story.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|At first I was reluctant to watch this movie...seem a little stupid...however my boyfriend wanted to watch it and since we didn't have anything else in mind to watch I just went with it. and well I ended up liking it. It was pretty vulgar but it was hilarious. Made me laugh most of the time. you want something to laugh about watch this movie!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book is very involved and probably tells the reader more than they can imagine about Yemen, drones and what goes on with the CIA!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is romantic and comical. A great look at that period in time through the eyes of a family living the experiences.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Read this book a long time ago and it was great to read through again. Provides great perspective into how to provide for those in your life by speaking their love language.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|So glad we could order it.  We have watched it over and over again.  The talent is amazing, as is the story.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Bought off of Amazon for about half the going price on other sites.  It came with the headphone connector and did not need to purchase the connector seperately.  So far it is working out well.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read and I'd recommend this book to all kids ages 5+
B004QX07G4|5.0|This was an entertaining book and a fast read.  She jumps around and writes about lots of different topics. It is very similar to her monologues on her show b
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who gave me no indication about the content or the story line. As soon as I started reading and realized it was going to be a \\"magical\\" story, I was hooked and did not want to put it down. It is extremely well written and easy to read. The author's descriptions of the characters and the circus created wonderful visualizations in my mind. I think for those of us who love magic, we would like to believe that there are people who really do have the gift of conjuring. This was a great trip into a world of magic and imagination. In addition, it was a great love story with an almost fairytale ending.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very fun. Kinda takes you back and reminds you of going to the arcade when you were growing up... Or am I the only one who played this game?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the many options available, like for left or right handed play. It's even better that it's a free app.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This app really really Really sucked for anything useful or fun. Stupid to download got rid of it in less than five minutes of chkg it out and deleted. Don't get this. Go watch a cartoon if you want a comparison. Stupid and retarded game the whole wad of it is bs

B002UEW31I|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie after getting it on Amazon Instant Video after not seeing it for a few years.  I decided to watch it with my wife and get back in the groove in preparation for Django Unchained.  We kicked back and enjoyed another slice of Tarantino greatness.  Well done!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Life on German Sub's during WWII was brutally dangerous, and a terribly deadly existance.  I think only fifteen percent who served in U-Boats, survived the war.  No movie has ever come close to any depection of life aboard those vesseles.  This movie, simply does.  Even if they were our enemy at the time, the movie allows a human interspection of the men, and their lives aboard.
B005LAII12|3.0|The first time we watched this movie it stopped several times and then a second or 2 later it would continue where it left off.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is a comical view on her life, and life in general. This is a great book to read, 16 and up! Great read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really like the anitcipation that books 1 &2 create for the reader, however, book three didn't come up short either.  It is a must read to finalize the trilogy!  Enjoy Hunger Games fans!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|but for me, it was handled more graphically than necessary.  I usually enjoy Nicholas Sparks books but the repetitive focusing to the point of dwelling upon the violence of the abuser took away from, rather than aided in, delivering the message.  The characters and story were believable and developed well but the over emphasis on evil actions took away from a potentially encouraging and hope filled story.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Watching it on Ipad is wonderful, even better than putting it on our big screen TV, the quality was almost like HD without the price
B001N3EZW2|4.0|Loved the story line.  The special effects, at the time this movie was made, are comparable to todays technical Sci Fi creations, just years ahead.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent entertaining. Suspense and twidst made it very interesting. The book was riviting in parts absolutely impossible to put down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game, vivid color and fast action played very well, downloaded smoothly did not make me angry or birdy thanks

B004CEUEWE|3.0|Okay movie. Nothing I would drop everything to see but it is worth the rental. Good bit of action and a decent cast
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book has it all mystery, romance, action, magic & history.  I'm recommending it to everyone. I can't wait for the last book of the series to come out.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting read. I have no doubt this experience is real because of the stress of trying to describe it. I do found myself bored at times with all the scientific terminology
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is an awesome game. I love it because you can have your friends in real life as your friends on the game. I really love littlest pet shop.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It's a good book for young kids but still entertaining for adults.  It does a good job of making mythology modern.
0345803485|1.0|First I thought I wasn't enjoying this book because I got it (actually, borrow it from the library, pat on the shoulder) for wrong reasons: bestseller, record breaker, and according to the buzz, spicy. So when such spiciness did not arrive after suffering the first 100 pages of common places, silly dialogues (Mr Gray... Anastasia... Christian... Ms Steel (??)) of characters constantly been held at arms length, snapping continually at each others while tilting their heads or biting their lips and uncountable repeated words and expressions (can someone please give the author a thesaurus?) I was tempted to just ask Yahoo where to look (hurt). Finally I decided to jump to it using the old pre-internet method when reading a bad book: fast-forwarding.  I was curious, I admite, about how a SM relationship works, so I skipped 10 to 20 (or more) pages en between readings, something I haven't done since reading Ivanhoe when I was 10 years old. But even skipping, at that point I was just so sick of the characters that probably not even the most passionate erotica would had made it for me and sadly this was not the case. I refused to believe there is something wrong with me, my husband, my ex, my girlfriends and theirs partners/husbands/boyfriends/exes, since non of us shares any sexual innuendo with the stereotyped descriptions: millionaire (sorry! BI-llonaire!) more-handsome-than-god man of huge-dimensions fells for unknown and unexplained reasons for clumsy insecure-to-the-point-of-sickness-multi-orgasmic-with-no-end-throat woman that reaches climax only with breast stimulus, or, even better, just on command! Even if you are into MS, this book is not worth the pain, better spend your money on a whip! Something the author can do is torture the words, specially the poor one \\"snap\\" that doesn't have a rest throughout the book. In my world (but in that one, again, man don't fly helicopters to work, are concert level pianist during theirs free time or gave me cars, laptops, blackberries or unlimited accounts to buy clothes... against my will!) people sometimes just speak to each other. I'm surprised he does not have a constant pain in the neck with that head always crooked. But oh, he IS into pain after all! However, the must unreal situation for me is the fact that she is finishing collage and does not have a computer or e-mail. REALLY? Is there such a kid? Or one like her roommate, that lets her borrow hers? Even less! I can take the private plane, the worth $12.000 books present or that the best Seattle's OB is summoned to see her on a Sunday morning, but no computer? Unbelievable. Not that any part of the book is more believable, but when you read super heroes novels you can accept that Superman can fly, as you may accept this billionaire prince charming magic (sorry, just cross that last word out and replace with 'stupid') world, but the computer one is just too much for me!<br />I believe it is great that women are exploring erotica or even porn, but is really sad that this extremely long badly edited fan fiction is the vehicle. I hope the trend will open the door of success for some quality writers that have (or will) made such a book a pleasurable experience for all the senses. Until then, remember, the best aphrodisiac is love, whatever love is, as you may hint by the end of the book if you are masochist enough to finish it. Yes, I was a bad, VERY BAD girl and read (kind of) until the last page, can someone spank me for that, please?<br /><br />Update:<br />After publishing this, I read some of others single stars reviews (clic on the one star image) and had a blast, to the point it compensate for all the bad lecture though the book<br />A couple I liked, you can find them easily on the first or second page of the one star categorie:<br />\\"Bestseller? Really???, \\"<br />\\"I want to give this book to someone I hate and tell them it's awesome. That's how bad it is.\\" (the 'Twinnings tea' part cracks me up every time I think of it!)<br />\\"Did a teenager write this???\\"<br />\\"\\"Fifty Shades\\" of really bad\\"<br />But my absolute favorite is...<br />\\"Not the worst I've ever read... No, wait. It IS.\\"<br />She (I think is a 'she) actually read with much more detail than me and took the trouble to count every abused word on the book, something I thought to do only after deleting it. Not even for free I wanted it contaminating my adored Kindle!<br /><br />Question: I know they made a CD with the songs, did anybody looked for the music? Im afraid to do it, even when a couple intrigue me. Please, save me some time, (I hope I saved you A LOT if you listened and stud away form any shade of '50') and tell me if any of them is worth the search time.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Its a great read.  Find myself wanting part to. I would say if you liked any of Morgans books give this a try
1603580557|3.0|I do not have a technical background and am a complete newbie to the systems school of thought. For this reason, I had hoped that \\"Thinking in Systems\\" was going to be a beginner's text on the subject and had believed that this might be true based on the \\"A Primer\\" subtitle.<br /><br />The author did deliver on introducing the reader to over a dozen applicable terms. The definitions introduced earliest in the book - stock, flow, and feedback loops - are the foundation blocks of what constitutes a system. Stock is defined as a resource, flow is the movement of that resource over a period of time, and a feedback loop is a mechanism in which that resource influences the flow.<br /><br />Some of the more higher level definitions introduced later in the book, while certainly applicable to the topic, were used to further the author's own viewpoints rather than illuminate the subject matter for a beginner. An example of this, and one of my favorite concepts, was \\"bounded rationality\\" where she used the framework of this concept - \\"We do our best to further our own nearby interests in a rational way, but we can take into account only what we know\\" (pg.106) - to later express personal viewpoints on Adam Smith's economics and the flaws of capitalism. (pg.109)<br /><br />There were also some unnerving sections where author takes her explanations to the spiritual and metaphysical realms.  In one section she discusses transcending paradigms, \\"There is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is \\"true,\\" that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension. It is to \\"get\\" at a gut level the paradigm that there are paradigms, and to see that that itself is a paradigm, and to regard that whole realization as devastatingly funny. It is to let go into not-knowing, into what the Buddhists call enlightenment.\\" (pg.164)<br /><br />It is actually ironic that I'm criticizing her for these whims into the political and the spiritual because that is where the book is most interesting. I don't even disagree with most of her viewpoints.  But still, it is inappropriate for a \\"primer\\" to delve into such politically loaded topics. It forces the reader to make judgments discerning between foundational concepts of a science and the spiritual beliefs of the author which is difficult to do for a newbie like myself.<br /><br />Overall, the author satisfactorily introduced terms, diagrams and provided a plethora of examples. The examples sometimes lost me because of the sheer quantity and scattered presentation. The biggest disappointment is that it did not provide a step-by-step guide for implementing systems thinking in the reader's own life.  Further, it lacked a reasoning for why the systems paradigm should even be used which is essential for a newbie to be motivated to learn more. As an introductory text, it is only mediocre at best for the aforementioned reasons.  However, maybe this book doesn't deserve to be judged by a misinformed \\"a primer\\" subtitle.  As a compilation of personal viewpoints and philosophies, I thought the author did a commendable job on airing her mental models \\"out into the light of day\\" (pg.172) and deserves much credit for her work.  She clearly has a vast intellect that shouldn't be confined to simple introductory texts.
0547884591|5.0|This isn't your average book. Other authors can sit down and write a book on cooking, or meta-learning, but will it really capture your attention? Several how-to cookbooks later, I still haven't read one all the way through. Until now. Normally I get bored with books. The way Tim writes, it's more like a conversation. A very, very interesting conversation with color pictures and diagrams. I'm not bored with ANY of his books. In addition to the book being captivating, it's nice to find a book you don't have to read from start to finish. It's more like &#34;Choose Your Own Adventure&#34; than anything else. Eventually I will read the whole book regardless. It's just that good. But it's been written in such a genius way that you don't HAVE to read the whole book to gain awesome information and skills. And not just about cooking.<br /><br />A side note: not only has this book helped me in life, but it's provided some pretty wicked conversation pieces. ( For instance, retelling Tim's &#34;Vermonster&#34; segment is a huge hit at social gatherings.)

030746363X|5.0|This isn't your average book. Other authors can sit down and write a book on working out, but will it really capture your attention? Normally I get bored with books. The way Tim writes, it's more like a conversation. A very, very interesting conversation. I'm not bored with ANY of his books. It's not scholastic mumbo-jumbo (although there's a lot of data to back up his claims).

It's also pretty awesome that he separates the book into segments. (Overall well being, fat burning, muscle building, etc)
B006HGXGWU|2.0|It could have, it should have but it didn't. Great idea, good acting but so endlessly dragged on to ending I no longer cared about, I just wanted the movie to be over.
B000EGDAI4|4.0|Excellent classic performance by one of the best sax players ever. And Max Roach is simply the killer jazz drummer of all time. I was particularly impressed by the sonic quality - for a mid 50's analog recording, it was produced really well - Roach's cymbals really stand out to me, and Rollins's exceptional style and tonality is well presented. Love every minute of it!
B004AM5QT4|5.0|Ken Follett has been my favorite author since I read Pillars of the Earth. The Third Twin is intriguing and fast paced. I kept putting it down so it would last longer. The Key to Rebecca was fabulous. The trilogy that includes &#34;Pillars&#34; was a pleasure to read. Follett describes places and people and the way they live so clearly, you can see them in your mind. I am going through all of his other books starting with Jackdaws which I am really enjoying. I can only hope he continues writing and I know he will only get better. Thanks Ken Follett for enhancing my life .
B00866JL96|5.0|Strange to say I usually like Nicholas Sparks books better then the movies.  Previously The Notebook was my favorite.  This blew the roof off the house!  It was so sweet and compelling the book and movie were both AMAZING!  P.S. Zac Effron this was so much better then high school musical ;) And the son is sooo adorable, I think he's the best young actor.  I just loved to see how well Logan got along with the son.  The other guy(forgot his name) her ex husbend scares me, in a natural way making him look humanly bad.  I watched this movie in theaters twice and then bought this!  Never will get tired of it <3  Oh and I would give it far more then '5' stars!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|My husband wanted to give it 8 stars. We were extremely happy with the acting, the story line and wanted that bad guy destroyed!! Isn't that the mark of a great flick? Very underrated and deserving of a big bowl of popcorn, soda or a beer and lean back for the evening!!
B006KSAPV0|4.0|Unique creepy story that entertained me and held my attention. Not necessarily for the feint of heart but if you like possibly real horror, it's a winner.
B000002I6X|4.0|Stills' 2nd album is his best, in my opinion. Fishes & Scorpions has to be one of the most spaced out songs ever, and Clapton's solo on it is killer. Marianne is a great shuffle; there's such variation on the album - why the hell don't bands try 3/4 time or different keys more often nowadays? - and his voice was at its finest. Also, he's underrated as a guitarist - the dude's a bitch, he could hold up w/ most anyone then and now. The horn arrangements are also excellent - we still love ya, Steve! OBTW - listen to Super Session, on Columbia, recorded in '68 w/ Al Kooper. Bloomfield played on Side 1, Stills on Side 2 - it's a KNOCKOUT blues rock record.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|What a well written book. I am a fan of Nicholas Spark and this book did not let me down. Great ending!!

B000VBJEEG|3.0|A bit behind in reviews. Enjoyed this movie at theater better than DVD. Not one of my fav movies but enjoyable nontheless.
0061969664|4.0|Anyone who has survived to age 10 while attending public school knows that humans, like the animals roaming the Serengeti, are divided into predators and prey.  However, for humans, it's not our ability to digest meat or plant foods that divides us, but our personality/psychology.  Most readers, or writers for that matter, of historical fiction, belong to the prey group and are more likely to worry about losing their lunch money to a new boy at the playground than to imagine an opportunity to take advantage of him. Generations of English teachers have been haranguing us that a character appeals to us because he is like us and we &#34;identify&#34; with him or her.  Mr. Cornwell has mastered the art of the contrarian view, that is, that a person totally unlike us the readers can be a source of superb entertainment.  In previous &#34;Saxon Tales&#34; novels, Mr. Cornwell has honed that skill, producing the Lord Uhtred, a schoolyard bully writ large, who not only robs other &#34;boys&#34; (and grown men) of their money but delights in slitting their throats and watching the blood stream out in a scarlet fountain as the expression fades from their eyes.<br /><br />&#34;Death of Kings&#34; gives us another action-packed episode in Uhtred's life, and like the others, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Why didn't I give it 5 stars, then?  Because, in this book, Uhtred has reached middle age, and we know from previous encounters that he is ultimately going to regain his stronghold of Bebbanburg.  Three things are troubling me about this book: one is that I was looking forward to the battle-royal to capture Bebbanburg from Uhtred's usurper uncle Aelfric, and didn't get it.  The other is that as a physical warrior like Uhtred reaches middle age, he ought to be climbing the career ladder to generalship.  It's apparent Mr. Cornwell is aware of that and he puts considerable intrigue and subtle maneuvering into this book, more than the others, but it still seems to me Uhtredis most at home in the center of the front rank of the shield wall, with his trusty sword Serpent's-Breath sheathed and his shorter dirk, Wasp-Sting, in his right hand while his shield is on his left arm.  He's in his 40's now, which was even older, relatively speaking, in the ninth century when few people lived to be 70 than it seems now.  Why isn't he watching from behind the lines, mounted, with a standard-bearer beside him to hold his halberd with the wolf's head banner?  Through messengers, he could better control the battle that way, and from a horse he'd have a clear view over the infantry's heads.<br /><br />The third problem, from the point of view of believability, is that all his life, Uhtred has been &#34;The Sword of the Saxons&#34; against the Danes.  However, he's still a pagan, and remains so to the end of his life, since he's telling the story in old age.  In King Alfred's time, it simply seems improbable that a mature man could do this when everyone around him is Christian.  Sure, a young rebel can be pagan because everyone else has embraced the new faith and he wants to be different; he also likes the Danes, he says repeatedly.  But after more than 20 years of service to the Christian king, whom he had the opportunity to escape a couple of times but didn't take it, it seems to me he would eventually either convert or at least pretend to convert.  Then there's the question of whether he could really have gotten away with being a pagan in King Alfred's service.  In the Heimskringla, Olaf Digre, King of Norway in the 11th century, actually has people who sacrifice to pagan gods executed!  In that period of aggressive, expanding Christianity, it just doesn't ring true that Uhtred could be pagan his whole life.<br /><br />However, these thoughts came to me after I'd finished reading the book.  It's a thrilling tale of Wessex's narrow escape from chaos after King Alfred's death, amply endowed with the bloody battles we've come to enjoy in the previousbooks of the series, and with just a little of the commander's point of view showing.  It's strongly recommended even though I didn't give it 5 stars.  I have mixed feelings about criticizing an author because he didn't write the book I was expecting; the book he did write is superb entertainment and also gives you a history lesson.<br /><br />But I'd like to see Uhtred, in the next book, use his newly acquired wealth in land to raise a fleet and an army, and carry out his life's mission of recovering his castle.  In remote Northumberland, the religion issue would seem less important, too.  On to Bebbanburg!
B00846REIS|4.0|This is a great book, better then 50 shades of grey!! Wish I would've read this one first.  I preferred this story line!
B003R0LBVW|3.0|This was a hard book to read and understand so to me it was just ok. I will probably read this book again to see if I can understand it better.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was as good, if not better then 50 shades of Grey!! I would recommend it to any add reader
B007ADIRDM|5.0|This is a cute set. I've seen it in the stores before, but I am pretty sure I got it a little cheaper on here. I received this on time. The couch is pretty sturdy, the doll is cute. Comes with several small pieces (coffee, food, etc.) This is cute and my daughter really liked it.
0765325950|5.0|And so, after more than twenty years of reading the series, The Wheel of Time comes to an astonishing, exciting, effective end. The fact that there even is an ending is something to be thrilled about - between the bloat that set in around books 9-10 and the literal death of an author, there were plenty of times when fans wondered if there ever would be an end to it all. And yet, in the capable hands of author Brandon Sanderson, The Wheel of Time comes together in a final volume that depicts the long-prophesied Last Battle in brutal, incredible detail. In fact, \\"The Last Battle\\" could easily have been the title of this final book, given that this is essentially a 900+ page account of a single war, even if it is broken into battles along the way. What that means for the reader is a book that's basically action from beginning to end, making this one of the most thrilling and fast-paced volumes of the series to date. And, my God, what action it is. Jordan (and Sanderson) spent years establishing the rules and boundaries of magic, and in A Memory of Light, all those rules combine, break, or stand to create a battle that looks and feels like no other battle I've ever read. And as if that's not enough, A Memory of Light delivers payoff after payoff, as each of our characters finally shows their full potential and fulfills all of the prophecies, viewings, and hopes that we've been experiencing for years. As with any final volume, not everything works as well as you might hope; there are a couple of plot threads and antagonists whose resolution feels perfunctory at best, and one can't help but wonder what Jordan and his military background would have brought to the sweeping tactics on display here. But for every minor issue, there are dozens of other scenes that make the final volume worth every day of the wait. More than that, Sanderson and Jordan do a superb job of mixing the action of the series with the heavy ideas about salvation, triumph, damnation, and what comes next that have always underlay every aspect of the books. The end result is one of the finest books of the series, one that brings everything to a magnificent conclusion that somehow pulls off the unlikely feat of giving a satisfying ending to a series that has lasted more than two decades. Even better, A Memory of Light knows how to strike a balance between ending the series and letting us understand that the world continues after the book ends, and it's telling that as I finished A Memory of Light, I realized that I could read plenty more books about the world of The Wheel of Time - and that's saying something, given how long the series went and how frustrating its bloat could be. But it's better to leave people wanting more than to overstay your welcome, and A Memory of Light leaves the reader exhausted, thrilled, heartbroken, exhilarated, and more than anything else, deeply and richly satisfied with this superb final volume in a series that will go down as one of the cornerstones of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Post-script: Like a lot of people, I find the decision to delay the e-book to be an utterly ridiculous one. By every account, Harriet doesn't really \\"get\\" e-books and thinks that people approach them as they do paperbacks. Should someone at Tor have done a better job explaining this? Yes, definitely. As a lover of e-books, I was pretty frustrated at having to carry around this massive tome - when you work and have kids, e-books are infinitely easier to deal with and read on the go. But even so, I feel like a review should reflect the quality of the book and not an issue with some external factor. So count me as with the e-book protesters in spirit, but in the end, the quality of this book merits the five star review, hands down.that have always underlay every aspect of the books.

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|About ten minutes into this movie I felt the need to use the bathroom,but I couldn't stop watching. Halfway through this movie I needed to go to the bathroom really bad,but like a good book I couldn't stop watching. Ten minutes before the ending I -CENSORED- my pants. Yes,this movie is that good.<br /><br />Next time I watch this movie or any movie for that matter I will wear an adult diaper. Do they make adult diapers that you can soil,take off,fold and wipe your -CENSORED- clean and simply flush it?<br /><br />That would make for a good product...Maybe I should take it on Shark Tank?<br /><br />Anyway,Fargo is a great movie.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Ive always enjoyed the movie and I finally read the book. It was a very good read and I really enjoyed the story and comparing it to the movie. As always the book was better than the movie.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Love Johnny Depp but Expected much more fun and laughs from this one, kinda boring and almost didn't make it to the end.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As always Scarpetta is riveting. Cornwell delivers with this character again and again. If you are looking for a change of pace with her try Portrait of a Killer, great stuff about Jack the Ripper.
B0098PX68G|5.0|The opening line of this film: &#34;. . . I'm 29, won't see 30. . .&#34; seems like it going to have said it all. But there's more to it than that, and fine performances all around. This isn't just some Hallmark disease movie, despite the blurb. Bring a hankie, and some fortitude.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|An extremely suspenseful book of a story which occurred during the Second World Ware in England and it held my interest until the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun, and the graphics are very good.  As stated in other reviews, some of the controls are sticky, but that hasn't interfered with things too much.  I would recommend this app.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|The Zombie Survival Guide was entertaining.  I really enjoyed the beginning's explanation of how the zombies came into existence.  The weapons section was pretty dull for an entertainment book, but since Brooks was writing this as a field guide, it is only appropriate that he puts it in here.  My favorite part was the historical encounters with zombies and how some past events lead to future attacks.  As mentioned before, I will read his other books as a result of this book.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family is a great show, well put together and well acted.  Something every second.  Watching the shows for the second (or even third time) you pick up even more that you missed the first time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't usually read mysteries per se, but much enjoyed this one.  It is told in a clever way and the writing is sometimes excellent -though it can become uneven.  I recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. And when I did it wasn't by choice. Best book in years. A must read
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love love love this show. Each season gets better. Watch one episode and you are addicted. I would recommend this show to anyone!
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|My son loves this movie so job well done at having a good price. He has watched it so much I fear I should have bought two.
B006O3MU96|4.0|I've got the original game on my iPhone and I really enjoy it.  It's a game the can quickly be played to kill a small amount of time and it's very fun to play.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|*ADVISE: If you purchase this DVD set distributed by Amazon, do everything you can to ensure you have no disc issues prior to the 30-day refund limit.  If any of the discs are going to be flawed, it will more than likely be Season 3.*<br /><br />The series is fantastic, of course, and I will leave others to comment on the content of the series.  My feedback is for the quality of the DVDs from Amazon, which I found to be unacceptable.  The product page actually warns potential buyers that those with poorer-quality players may experience playback issues.  Funny how these are the only DVDs I have ever had playback problems with.<br /><br />While Season 1 did not have any playback issues, I have experienced issues so far on EVERY single disc for Seasons Two - Four.  Season 3 is almost unwatchable, while the other seasons are hit and miss.  Thankfully, due to a week of the flu, I have had the chance to get this far into watching it before the 30-day return policy expires and have requested a replacement.  I will update my review on the replacement.
0810989956|5.0|My daughter loves this series and this book was a great compliment to them. It not only gives them some more reading material but also lets them use their imaginations and get creative.  We def recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Really like this app works great and I was happy I could get this information on my kindle for free.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was an enjoyable book written with humor, honesty and remarkable insight.  A unique perspective of the West coast from a talented writer.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I'm a TV Show junkie and I watch almost every scripted show.  This is hands down the best one of 2012.  The first and last episodes of the 3 episode season are both classics.  Each episode is more like a movie than a TV episode as they run about 90 minutes.  It's well written and brilliantly acted.
1607066017|5.0|And man... totally worth it.  It's this really weird fantasy meets sci-fi universe with some really bizarre visuals.  The artwork is great and the writing is fantastic.  If you're curious about this series or have heard about this series, I'd recommend you pick this up and give it a try. (Likewise if you haven't read Vaughan's other series Y: The Last Man)<br /><br />The only downside is waiting for the next book in the series at this point.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Stop with the &#34;Like us on Facebook&#34; pop-up!!!!!  Or at least not so often.  It is very frustrating.  That is all
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like looking at all the pictures and I really like being able to get recipes that I am interested in
B004IK9CTS|5.0|This story is a classic, astounding tale. However, the Kindle version's cover is that of Thomas Jefferson, or a highly similar portrait. I wish such a semblance could be corrected because it appears like a major mistake and lack of concern on the publishing end. Maybe this is just my opion but still, I thought someone should mention it. I highly recommend this story though!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are so much fun!  Their music is a great blend of classical and popular. Their videos are hilariously fun or beautifully scenic to watch and think of as I listen to this CD.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Easy to use and its something I need when I go do errands and make sure I didn't forget anything.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I picked this book to read after stumbling upon some quotes on tumblr, and I was not let down. It's a great read, short too, for anyone, and it offers a great look into the angst, confusion, depression, and pain that growing up can cause. Now, and I hate to say it, lol, I can't wait to buy the dvd (:
1400069289|5.0|I found this book most interesting and thought provoking.  So much so, that I gave it as Christmas gifts to family members this year!  It went from personal habits, to corporate practices, to societal workings.  Very interesting how it all fits together.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|The photography was brilliant in this movie while the landscapes transported you to a land not known much about. The Ozzie flavor of slang words, humor and way of life helps you discover what this love story is all about. A beautiful English rose and a rough tough man of the land meet and against all odds fall in love. The Japanese attacking far north Australia, in Darwin during World War 2 is an eye opener not many people will know about. A beautiful movie.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers is a quick learn and is great for groups of 2-6 (with the expansion).  Games are relatively quick and fun!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show and love the CD just as much.  Can't wait for the next CD to come out.
B003PM5Y4M|2.0|It has a few funny moments but its too lackluster in between those moments to really enjoy the movie. Dont waste your money buying it. Rent it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great family fun for all ages me and my family love having Sunday morning in bed seeing who can win.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I love Matt Damon but this was a really enjoyable movie, lots of action and suspense. Enjoyed the story line
B001N1DPDE|5.0|It took me months to decide whether or not I should get the Becker BK2. I read on lots of forums and searched around for comparable knives but I ended up pulling the trigger and buying one. It arrived today. As everyone else seems to say, this thing is impressively massive. The 1/4\\" thick blade is just sick. I imagine there's very little I could do with this knife and be concerned about damaging it. I obviously haven't gotten to test it out yet but when I do I will update this review with my thoughts.<br /><br />Unfortunately as others said the sheath is crappy. It's extremely difficult to get the knife out. The handles are also lacking but some cheap mods can be done to improve the grips if you don't want to spend the $ on micarta. Right out of the box the blade is decently sharp, but not as sharp as a new Mora comes. I'll see if I can touch it up w/ the Lanksy. Overall for $60 I don't think you'll find a knife that will be able to take any more abuse than this thing will. I'm yet to test it, but it's kinda obvious once you hold this hunk o' steel in your hand. Go ahead, buy it!
0765325950|1.0|Upsetting you have to wait for the Kindle I paid for the entire series now they make we wait to try and lure me into buying the hardcover?  How much profit do u need?  Electronic copy cost you nothing its all profit wtf
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Literally! Love this movie. Has a great cast and plenty of surprises. Very highly recommended if you are a fan of any of the stars in this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Typical Mahjong but find would very much like the tiles to be a bit larger and the symbols a little easier to tell the difference.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|so much better than the first total recall, more realistic and enjoyable without the silliness or hype of phoniness to it
0515153656|5.0|This was a very good book at a great price and I also appreciate a quick shipment.  Thanks very much!
0765325950|1.0|I bought all 13 of the previous books for my Nook (despite owning hard copies of them as well) and am disappointed in Harriet Jordan for her decision to not release the eBook until April.  She is worried about her husband's legacy but has done irreparable damage to it by her actions.  Instead of focusing on the excitement of the final Wheel of Time book she has caused anger and resentment, as well as brought negative attention to a fantastic series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple to use. Has all the function keys necessary to complete my task. I would recommend this app to family and friends.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|If you are expecting the book to be like the play or the movie you will be surprised.  The play/movie is only a very small part of the entire book Les Miserables.  Truthfully, I've not finished all 900+ pages yet so perhaps it is 5 stars.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Although I would recommend this book to Lee Child fans, I found it somewhat bogged down in the center of the read . . . The majority of the action occurs in the final 45 pages, but getting there becomes boring and repetitive at times . . . [Jack] Reacher has always been ultra cool but seems disconnected and aloof in this installment . . . Four stars to Lee Child [and Reacher] out of loyalty, but frankly, this book could have been better paced . . .
B008XHACWS|5.0|This was a very good book at a great price and I also appreciate a quick shipment.  Thanks very much!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is my FAVORITE game on my kindle fire! I reccomend this game very much to all people who like a relaxing game. P.S. A LOT better than dragon story.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great christmas gift...good quality...very inexpensive for the good quality you get...loved that i was able to get it on blu-ray
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very light romance with a different twist.  They start out married after an evening's date.  Only problem is the bride doesn't remember the marriage, the groom doesn't want a divorce - and a bit classical on the compromise.
0765357151|2.0|I expected more out of this book after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It does introduce some interesting ideas regarding human-vampire relationships, but ultimately it wasn't enough for me. Also, the main character was hard for me to relate with and Matheson's writing style wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />Amazon consensus says I'm an outlier. It's not that expensive, so if you decide to buy it I hope you like it.<br /><br />Lastly, be aware that only half the book is \\"I Am Legend\\". The rest is a series of short stories (also by Matheson).
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best show ever created. Even 10 seasons in, it is still full of suspense. Can't wait for it every week.
B007HO392S|4.0|My granddaughter loved it.  She knew many of the songs by heart.  Carrie Underwood is great and she is good for my grandchildren to listen to.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I've been wanting this movie for ages, and finally got it!<br />I watched it about three times already and even got my<br />family to watch it.
0307352145|5.0|Being an introvert , from an family of introverts,, the book helped clarified many things for me.  I only wish it had been available earlier in my life. I recommended it to several friends
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love my Kindle and have enjoyed using it.....I like that I am able to get The Weather Channel on it where I can see what is going on with the weather.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A great  tale and a treat for one's imagination. Looking forward to the next book in the series. Truly a work of art.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|DVD arrives in good shape and on time.  My Grandson was thrilled to receive this movie and watched it immediately.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Excellent, like to know if the writer have expierenced any of the activities or if this is just fantasies being written.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Dude, great book and you deserve everything that's coming your way.  I don't even remember what initially led me to this book, but I'm glad I found it.  I loved the whole series.  Keep it up!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have enjoyed using Facebook with my desktop computer but it is most enjoyable being able to use my Kindle to connect with Facebook.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Got this game for my daughter for her Kindle, and she absolutely loves it! She loves drawing, and for her to see her creations in action is really fun. Good game!
B008OOYALE|1.0|this game is just dragon vale but a lot worse you never get gold so then there is no point in playing just get dragon vale people how many words is this by now I hope it has reached twenty
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best game it is better than any hammer I ever played un my life. it is so fun
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good story line and great graphics. Couldn't put it down. Worth the money. Recommend highly especial for those who like twist and turns. Great ending.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Just like the game we played on the Atari.....I have enjoyed this game especially since it is also free. Nice to get free games.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|My daughter Loves her stuffed kitten she sleeps with it every night! Got here fast and perfect. I loved the paw tissue it came with. Her brother has the penguin and Santa penguin. They are a year apart and they call his Ty penguins puff puff and mrs puff puff and the Ty unicorn and this cat are the kids of the penguins so these toys bring something a lot don't. Imagination! 😄
B008MEM24S|5.0|hours of fun.  challenges your mind while having lots of fun.  great app for teens too.  great price.  water continued.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|So after reading dog days I was amazed to see how much I loved the book. I am 8 years old and I enjoyed how realistic this book was .<br /><br />A.R.S
B000W93CHC|5.0|Having read &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; I was entralled with this book.  It was easy to pick up after an interruption and held my interest to the end.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is now my favorite. I would recommend it to readers of all ages who are able to read between the lines.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book!!! Can not wait to read the next one! I want to study Greek mythology . It's so fascinating
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A book by Nelson Demille is always on my &#34;must read&#34; list and this one doesn't disappoint.  And as hoped, this book has Mr. Demille's welcome between the lines humor and reading style.  Although a bit long in getting into the anticipated grit of the story it is however very enjoyable all along the way.  And we always learn a bit of political and geographical history along the way so we are better for it.  Thanks Mr. Demille! Keep writing for us!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It kept me entertained! It was suspenseful and a good read. Some scenes were racy but it was a goof book
B00000G3PA|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND I HAD TO REPLACE MY OLD DVD THAT MY DVD PLAYER WOULDN'T READ. GREAT PRICE
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|this is a pretty funny movie, had me laughing almost the whole time i watched it. it is definitely for 18+
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Perfect suspense and follow through. Apollo much better than the movie (obviously) Can't wait to read book 2
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It is 12:25 am and I am trying so desperately not to wake my sleeping husband with my sobbing. What an incredible story. All the reviews that say carve out a block of time because you won't want to put this book down, well, they are correct. I couldn't put this book down. My poor abandoned children. It was worth it. I adored these characters. Sky and Holder were amazing characters. I loved them. I loved their friends too. The author surprised me again and again and when that happens, I know I've found a great story. Buy this book. It's heart wrenching and sweet and sad and gut wrenching but hopeful too. But the best part of it, the love story part. You'll love it too. I promise.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I wasn't a fan of this book really. It didn't really grab my interest until I was about 50% of the way through it. Gone girl was a much better read by Flynn.
B0094K1K42|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious.  It's a dark comedy.  Those who don't find it funny most likely don't enjoy the genre.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a beautifully written and heartfelt story. I would recommend this book to everyone. The characters, the love, the intensity and passion is overwhelming. The author did a wonderful job putting together all the pieces, the characters, and the timelines to create a momentous love/survival story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love that I can keep up with so many from the family and our friends that live far away - great fun,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspense filled this book is a great read. I couldn't put it down.<br />Loved the way it ended! I highly recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a nice clean romatic story it gets your attention at the begining and you don't want to put it down till you finish.
B009CGLO3K|5.0|I love Kristen Stewart, and Chris Hemsworth. This is a movie I will continue to watch over, and over again.  I hope they will be the same characters for the next one, if there is one.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|The story was good, but I could see ahead of time where it was headed. The surround sound was great with the beating of the drums and the swoosh of arrows flying over your head. The video is crisp and clean. A good purchase if you have kids, if not still worth seeing, just expect that the story line is a bit predictable. Sit back and enjoy!
B008HK3TXK|4.0|The TIMBUK2 GRIPSTER JACKET FOR KINDLE FIRE HD 7\\" is a pretty cool case and holds the device securely in place.<br /><br />It feels good and comfortable when holding it with one hand while reading, but you do have to keep the cover held open since it doesn't have anything to latch onto when you bend it back.<br /><br />You can charge the KINDLE FIRE HD 7\\" with the TIMBUK2 GRIPSTER JACKET in the closed position as there's an opening for the AC port.<br /><br />The case will add a little bulk to device (unlike the [[ASIN:B008IJRAAS Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\\" Standing Leather Case, Royal Purple (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]] which is my favorite since it doesn't add any bulk and it'll put the Kindle to sleep when the cover is closed), but the Velcro closure will keep the case shut securely.<br /><br />I don't think this case will make the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" sleep like the one above when you close the cover so keep that in mind.<br /><br />If you use a stylus, I've been able to hold the [[ASIN:B00902SHEU Marware Capacitive Stylus for Kindle Fire, Purple]] inside the case by placing it in the back by the fold. Although the case doesn't have a stylus holder, it does keep the MAREWARE STYLUS in place until you open it. See the picture I posted above.<br /><br />The TIMBUK2 CASE has these rubber(?) gripper feet on the outer edges of the opening part, which allows the case to display the device horizontally, at almost any angle and on any surface. This is really good for watching shows on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />One word of caution: I almost ripped the case because I thought that the Kindle Fire HD was supposed to slide into the rubberized frame that holds it into place. The instructions do not show how to insert the Kindle, so I thought that the frame stretches but it DOES NOT! The top part of the frame, which is located where the cover bends and not the opening, is folded back and has Velcro which is holding it closed. It's seamless so it doesn't look like the top part of the frame detaches from the cover, but it does. Once this area is opened the device will slide right in.<br /><br />It's not perfect, but if you MUST carry a stylus with you and don't mind a little bulk then the TIMBUK2 GRIPSTER CASE will suit you just fine. If you don't need to carry the stylus or want something that offers protection without bulk get the recommended standing leather case I mentioned above.part of the frame detaches from the cover, but it does.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|This is not just an action movie, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the story was interesting and kept you watching.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I bought this guy as soon as it came out. It worked fine, in fact, it worked perfectly well. until it suddenly stop charging the phone. There is only so many things i could have done wrong.. just plug and charge. But it indeed stopped charging the phone after 29 days of us. :(
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Thumbs up, great little app! It estimates the battery time remaining for various device uses including for example web browsing, reading and listening to music.
1603427244|5.0|Not only does the book contain step by step instructions with photos it provides additional information as to how and why various types are used. There are also recommendations on whether to use a given cast on or bind off depending on the makeup of the body of the garment.
B00846REIS|4.0|I stayed glued to this book and the next one Reflected in You.  Predictable, but good story, very sexy without all of the slapping, spanking stuff.  I'm looking forward to the 3rd book in this series.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I was surprised that this movie was not all action and explosions, but rather a deep dark look into the inner turmoil of a man who has not yet found himself. There are twists and turns that you will not expect. The video is crisp and clean and the surround sound is definitely reference material. I bet you will watch this movie more than once.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I'm sorry to say that after waiting - and waiting for Preston/Child's newest Pendergast novel - I was less than thrilled.  For the very first time - having read EVERYTHING by both authors - I was extremely disappointed.  I felt that they were not at their best. Far too many sub-plots - and a hasty conclusion.  The character development was thready at best.  I usually can't wait to pass along my Preston/Child novels - not so with this one.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book. It was a great week-end curl up on the couch kind of a book. I would highly recommend it to young adults to seniors.
1574214276|5.0|I love this book. It has a large variety of tangle patterns. The directions are easy to follow and the diagrams are great. I really recommend this book.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|when i saw this one for sale i was estatic . was told this move wasnt for sale on any format , and to have such an historical movie is great
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well laid out plot with the usual good Grisham touch.  What more do you need to know to get it?
B003U6BE8I|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun for the whole family. The acting was good and the action was fun and exciting. While the mythology was a little off it still is a nice introduction to the world of Greek gods and goddesses.

B004QX07G4|5.0|One of the funniest books I have ever read.  Big thumbs up for this book.  Can't wait for Ellen to publish a new one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. From start to finish. I couldn't stop reading it and was sad when it was over!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is very entertaining, especially for those of us who have lived in England. The acting is superb!! Maggie Smith is of course the ultimate when it comes to delivering a realistic role!!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Me and my boys love the concept behind the game.  I play the stickman I drew and felt invincable. My sons laugh a lot while we play.
1439181780|5.0|I've had my copy of The Power since 2008. So far, it's the only book that I made sure I read at least once a year. And every time I do so, I learn something new. I guess an additional year of experiences allowed me to pinpoint the applicability and the truth in what this book is espousing. Power of attracting what is good is really possible when you apply love and gratitude. The more gratitude and love you pour into something, the more it comes back to you.<br /><br />I really love this book. I feel everyone who wants a positive change in their lives should read this.<br /><br />Apart from the great content, this book also has great illustrations, layout and flow.<br /><br />Thank you Rhonda Byrne for sharing your knowledge and for writing this book. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
B009X01FJS|5.0|Love this case.  Love the horizontal and vertical feature.  Likes that there are a lot of colors to choose from.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You should read all three. Each picks up where the last left off. the story and character interaction gets better and better as you go through the books. I'm currently re-reading all of them.
0765325950|5.0|It is an odd thing to read a 900 page book that is entirely an ending.  So many story threads had been dealt with leading up to this and yet so many still remained.  Its hard to judge this book on its merits alone.  I started reading this series 12 years ago.  While it may have meanderd and gotten bogged down a bit towards the middle of the series on the whole I enjoyed the journey.  The Memory of Light provided much in the way of closure.  Many of the smaller chracters I had feared would go on forgotten (including a certain shaggy horse) were gaiven chances to make one last appearance if only for a few paragraphs.  I am as satisified with the ending to this as I am with an other ending.<br /><br />Ps One star reviews, review the book not the publisher.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is without a doubt in my mind Stephen King's best work. He uses more than just writing in his technique. He uses emotional responses from the reader. In the book, tears will flow from your eyes, in correlation with Jake Eppings, the main character. King was remarkable. I recommend this to fans of romance, suspense, horror, sci fi, any novel genre. It was as perfect as they come.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|If you are a lover of literature and would like nothing more than to hunker down next to a fireplace in a stately library for the rest of your days, this is the book for you. This entire book is books, from dusty volumes to leather bound volumes, this book is really a 'book lover's' read. The story here has many unexpected twists. I loved watching the characters build relationships with one another as the book progressed. This author has a fantastic way of spinning words that makes you forget you are reading a modern work. There is an almost classical ambiance in this book that made me feel right at home. By about two-thirds of the way through the book I started dreading the inevitable, the book would naturally have to end and I would have to find something else to occupy my time. It really is great. Highly recommend.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Likes this game.  Likes it that you can view it horizontal or vertical.  Same game as on a pc.  Would buy it again.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Have to adobe for most of the games i like to play on my Kindle Fire HD... Quick and easy to install..
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not the best Reacher book to date. The storyline was not as interesting as some of the others in the series. Still a good read though.
B005LAII80|5.0|Karl Urban gives a great performance as Judge Dredd. He pushes the movie along and easily conveys a steely sense of determination along with a downright and understandably mean attitude during the picture. The action and pacing is very solid throughout.<br /><br />The movie looks good on Blu Ray (4/5 for the 2D version) but the DTS HD MA 7.1 soundtrack (5/5) is the real gem on this disc. It is ferocious to say the least. The audio has amazing power and directionality across the entire sound field. This will be a real treat for audiofiles and owners of a beefy home theater system.<br /><br />Buy this one without hesitation or reservation!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was an amazing book. I loved how the characters were so real feeling and that you could actually feel the emotion. I can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out in April!! A must read!
B00632HWOG|2.0|The app is continually an issue and seems to get worse as time goes on.  It never seperates the email according to disposable email addy.  The new GUI sucks.  On my Kindle Fire HD, I cant even use the app because the top of the app/screen/GUI totally disappears and to get it back I have to open an email, then choose another folder OR I just quit the app and access my email via the web interface.  On both my Fire and Android smartphone, the app wont even delete the mail that I have selected.
B007L6VR12|5.0|One wonders what would pulll Bill Murray out of his self inposed exile, combine him with a very tongue in cheek Bruce Willis and Frances McDormond and we find it here. Wes Anderson makes odd, but compelling movies that appeal not only to adults but to young adults and children. It's a shame his movies don't do better in theaters but don't miss a chance to watch this wonderful, coming of age movie.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Anna loves Polly Pocket sets and any thing of Barbie equally, her mom put the sets together, and Anna was in her room for the rest of the day, only coming out  for a little while. That really pleased me that I could get exactly what she wanted

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|You have to read the last book if you've read the first two. I read them because both of my granddaughter and my daughter were reading them. I like to know what they're reading.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and was mesmerized by Michael Jackson and his talent.  I bought this DVD as a reminder of his talent and contribution to the world of music.  I didn't approve of his lifestyle, but have to admit he was one of the best in our world of music.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Martin focuses on a different set of characters than the prior books, as he continues to move his pieces around in the game of thrones. It is true that your favorite characters from the last couple books of mostly absent, but this book has plenty of interesting characters and stories to keep you interested.  If you liked the first three books, there is absolutely no reason to avoid reading book four.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|Hammer Films made a splendid comeback with the remake of &#34;Let The Right One In&#34;, (which I liked as much, but for different reasons), the visuals, sound and performance of the entire cast to me was as good as it gets! Chloe Grace Moretz, and Kodi Smit-McPhee were riveting and could not take my eyes off of them! I saw this film on the big screen and was amazed at how the tension in this film was unrelenting from the opening to closing shots. 5 Stars! Horror with heart and soul.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|Quite simply, this book is well written and engaging. I was pleasantly surprised by the price and lack of a certain manner of pretentious writing one encounters in fan based books/books written by a character the author didn't come up with in the first place.<br />The story itself offers a number of explanations the show does not, along with interesting background stories. The plot is rather simple, but as mentioned above, very pleasant to read. Fully deserves my five stars.

B003XRELGQ|5.0|This is the second time I've read this story - the first time was when I was at university.  I really enjoyed the book back then but now, free from the pressure of study, I've found it even more delightful.  Read it if you like Black Humour with a dose of Science Fiction. Cat's Cradle has a special blend of tragedy and utter silliness that will keep you engaged to the bitter and ridiculous end - it leads the reader to think of the absurdities of human civilization and how the highest of ideals are most often brought undone by basic human weaknesses of character in both leaders and followers.  The narrator is not preachy or judgemental because he fails to notice himself stumbling into the whole mess until it's too late - and then hindsight proves completely worthless.  Cat's Cradle is a short novel and the chapters are brief, so it's a good book to read when you don't have much time.  Despite its brevity the story is jam packed with interesting characters, important themes and absurd events - plus an actual hook.
0765325950|5.0|Ignore the reviews for 1 star because the ebook wasn't released along side the hardcover.  love the series and glad it was actually finished after the death of jordan. great book!
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when one of my kids had this on their Christmas list but it is really a lot of fun.  It's a change of pace from the original monopoly.  Professionally packaged.  Arrived in excellent condition and on time.

B004KSQN7C|2.0|Up until Circus, Britney loved making albums.  She was alway so happy doing performances and interviews, and unfortunately, we'll probably will have to settle with her playing it safe with her career.  I've somewhere that this album is like Blackout 2.0, well, Britney was the executive producer of Blackout.  Aside from Pharrell Williams, she worked with all new producers and songwriters.  Even Circus, the album she started playing it safe with, has Danja songs on it.  A lot of songs on this album sound like basic songs, from odd vegatable lyrics in Drop Dead Beautiful, to the overtly autotuned I Wanna Go, this album lacks Britney's spark and personal flare.  For me, Criminal and the deluxe edition tracks sound the most unique.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This story was so compelling I could not put it down. It was truly inspiring. I highly recommend it even if you are not in to war stories.

0307719219|4.0|Why Nations Fail has a simple thesis - failure is due to extractive political and economic structures. Conversely, success is linked to inclusive political and economic structures. Failure gets worse with the vicious cycle and success gets better with the virtuous cycle. Sounds too simple? The authors support their thesis with lots of historical case studies starting from the 15th century. But in several cases they refer to contingency as a factor in predicting the outcome of a given movement towards change. And, contingency means lots of things with complex interplay. So, can you use the theory to predict if a nation will fail or be successful? No - and this is something that the authors clearly explain. You can use their theory to understand why a nation failed in the past - no predictive power claimed.<br /><br />I think a key limitation of the book was that it has taken the Nation as a unit of analysis and looked at internal political and economic structures without looking at the external environment. They do talk about colonialism as an external force that pushed nations towards failure in the past. This should have been extended to modern forces like globalization, monetary unions, trade regimes, and violence (formal in the shape of wars and informal in the shape of terrorism). How would we rate the success or failure of PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain) or BRIC (Brazile, Russia, India, and China). They talk about the robber barons of the 20th century in the US but fail to extend this into the 21st century especially the finance industry and its effect on national success or failure.<br /><br />I think the biggest shortcoming in the book is that it does not spend enough time on the contemporary world. There is no real attempt to identify the inclusive or extractive factors the effect polity and economy as we are experiencing it today. On the balance the book was a good read, the thesis and ideas were presented very clearly and there is a lot of supporting narrative from the past. But it's not going to tell you who is headed for failure or success.

B00004XPPE|5.0|Fail-Safe, 1964 film<br /><br />It begins with a man leaving his wife in the early morning, he dresses in his military uniform. In Washington DC a political scientist talks about the effects of a thermonuclear war. Who will win? Is this crazy talk or a game? We see other military people. Crews on the bombers are changed regularly. [No cohesion or trust?] Bombers are in the air continuously in case of a surprise attack. Satellites can detect humans on the ground. Radar can detect a UFO. Bombers fly toward a fail-safe point then wait for a signal to attack. The system is \\"fail-safe\\", nothing can go wrong by design. The group discusses mass attacks on civilians. Can this be minimized? Maybe not. Can a \\"limited war\\" be fought? A nuclear war would exterminate most people. The next stage of readiness occurs when that UFO alters course. Condition Green occurs!<br /><br />That UFO is a commercial airplane that is off course due to a mechanical problem. The warning is called off. But one flight of bomber goes on. Can it be recalled? Fighters are sent after it to recall it or shoot it down! Three is a discussion over this. The President orders it done. Any airman who falls into the freezing ocean will perish. The President talks to Omaha. Was it a mechanical failure? The more complex the system the more likely it will have a failure. The Russians sent up their fighter airplanes in response. That Professor has an explanation. Does it make sense to you? [Who is the crackpot here?] The pursuit fighters \\"flame out\\" and crash into the sea, the bombers fly on. The overtones in speech can provide information about the speaker. The President calls the Premier to warn him. Will he be believed? Is there trust? The Russians have their fighters, and missiles too! Can they stop the bombers?<br /><br />The flight of six bombers crosses the Russian border, a state of war. Radar shows the results. The Premier talks to the President. Was Russian jamming the cause of that mechanical failure? Yes. Their computers decided that this American flight was a threat. The President orders General Grady to turn back. Will he obey? He only follows orders. Can the Russian fighters stop those bombers? No, their anti-radar masks their true position. The Professor asks for a sneak attack! Communication between Omaha and Moscow is established. General Black will follow orders. The President acts to prevent a general nuclear war by ordering full cooperation with the Russians. There is a way to over-ride the radar and infrared detectors on the missiles. The bombers fly lower to evade radar. Will the tension affect a military officer?<br /><br />What will the President do? Will he trade New York for Moscow? What else can he do to evade a general war? This action is the only way out. The Russians will launch anti-aircraft rockets against the last bombers. Can they be defeated? The bomber pilot's wife talks to him, will this work? Would an alarm cause a panic in a big city? They talk about the deaths and destruction that would occur. What happens when machines get out of control? What do we say to the dead? [We didn't mean it?] There is a high-pitched squeal from the telephone to Moscow. The President order s the bombs dropped! And so this cautionary message movie ends. The Defense Department says it can't happen here.<br /><br />This movie was adapted from a novel. In 1962 there was an incident when radar warned of a massive missile attack from the west. The top general did not allow a counter-strike. The investigation found that the newer and more powerful radar detected the moon rising over the horizon and misinterpreted the echo. The result was to create a teletype hotline from Washington DC to Moscow for immediate contact. A nuclear test ban followed. Any nuclear war would create a nuclear winter from dust thrown into the atmosphere and kill off most people.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Knowing I was a big reader and lately really into dystopian society stories, a friend recommended I read the Wool series. Well let me tell you want I didn't like about this story... Done. What I did like about this story was the character development, unique plot, and unexpected turns. I found myself connecting to these characters, cheering them along in their endeavors. I loved that I was constantly shocked at what happened next. I was about 1/1000 in correctly assuming where this was going next! If you're a fan of sci-fan, dystopian literature, I would strongly recommend the Wool series.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought this was a simple, teenager type book. Boy was I wrong!  This books had a ton of twists that you didn't see coming.  I loved every page of it.
B008Y7J3UY|4.0|Bought this while I was in Kansas. Wife gave me a Kindle for Christmas.  Bought the movie, because it was like $5 and I needed something to watch on our flight home to Los Angeles.  Man was I happy with my purchase. Not only did it eat up time, it was worth at least $25.<br /><br />It was entertaining and the storyline was actually pretty cool.  Lots of action.  If you're on the fence, just buy it.  It's worth it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I totally enjoyed reading the whole trilogy. I have told everyone this is great.<br />Waiting on the movie to come out now.
B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased this item for my girlfriend she loved the books. the convenience of being able to read on her ipad is awesome...
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I loved the story line!!  There were a couple points of the movie that were predictable, but I would watch it again!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I liked the first book on the trilogy better and am looking forward to the 3rd book in the Trilogy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I totally enjoyed reading the whole trilogy. I have told everyone this is great. I also have book one.<br />Waiting on the movie to come out now.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Brilliant book.  Will need to re-read it at least once to decide what actually happened.  Will see the film but doubt it will live up to the beautiful prose.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I liked the 2nd law because it was a different kind of music. I never really enjoyed this kind of music before but after listening to the twist Muse puts on it I really enjoy it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was very entertaining. I never wanted to put it down! I finished it in 3 days! I have never read a better book!!!!!!!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Good GOD is there any way that Aloysious can catch a break?!  This is a real page turner.  P-DAWG has got some complex problems, some tragic and you can &#34;feel&#34; this one building to an exciting face melt of revenge and intrigue.  Characters are created slowly and with descriptive targets. The plot moves along at a pace that allows readers to immerse themselves into the story.  One of the best Pendergast novels. Nicely done PC!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Find this very hard to use on my Kindle.  It doesn't find it half the time and when it does find it, it is sketchy.  Usually don't even try anymore
0345533054|5.0|There is nothing quite like reading a good mystery. A book that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first page to the last word. No mystery that I have ever read has done this better the Gone for Good by Harlan Coben. The book was published by Orion in 2002. The book follows the life of Will Klein, who as a young boy thinks his older brother Ken is the best person in the world. However, as he and his brother grow older, something changes. Ken gets mixed up with the wrong crowd, and ends up becoming a murder suspect in the murder of a local young a very beautiful girl. Ken has no choice but to flee, and Will continues to think that his brother is innocent of the crime. Years go by and Will thinks his brother has died. He starts his life as an adult and gets a steady girlfriend. However, little does he know that the worst is yet to come.<br />After Will's mom dies, he learns that his brother may still be alive. This sends Will's head spinning, and he enlists the help of his friend Squares for help in finding his brother. But then things start to get strange. Will's girlfriend Sheila runs away one night without any warning, and then she is later reported dead. All this time, Will and the sister of the girl that was thought to be killed by Ken are being pursued by the Ghost, a serial killer who is employed by the largest murderer in New York. In order to find out the truth about Ken, Sheila, and what happened all those years ago, Will and Squares must go on a journey that takes them through the worst parts of New York City all the way to the midwest. There are many twists and turns along the way, such as Will getting arrested for the attempted murder of Katy Miller, the sister of the girl Ken tried to kill.<br />This is one of the best mysteries that I have ever read for many reasons. The first of which is the way the book is set up. The author writes in very short chapter, no more than ten to twelve pages a chapter. This allows the author to quickly switch between talking about important parts of the book, which helps with the flow of the book. Another reason that the book is a success is because of the way that there is a lot of little mysteries all tied into the big mystery of the book. Since there is an answer to one of these little mysteries almost every chapter, it keeps the reader interested in the whole book because there is always something new to be learned. The final reason that I thought the book was successful was because the line between good and bad in the story was a very fine one. Over the course of the book, good characters become bad and bad characters become good. Fair warning, the ending the the book will a big surprise and change the way you think about the story.<br />In conclusion, this is one of the best mysteries that I have ever read. It combines the concepts of a compelling storyline, the battle of good against evil, and a dynamic main character. The author Coben does a great job of keeping the book interesting all the way through. There really is never a dull moment in the story, as the plot continues to twist and turn from start to finish. Though the book may have some parts and themes that may not be good for young children, it is a book that can easily be read by a young adult. It is a great choice for a person that wants a book that they will never put down and will be excited to read. Just a warning, if you read the book you may find that you have trouble doing anything else with your life because you will not want to put the book down.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Worth buying, I really loved playing this game . The graphics were awesome and the story line was fun. I just wish it was a longer game much to short for me.
145210655X|5.0|I can't wait until my nephews actually get the witty Star Wars references in this book.  It's filled with a ton of inside jokes that only Star Wars fans would get.  My brother thought it was a riot.  Aside from that, the pictures and stories are very appealing to it's target market.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it...very well written and superb acting.  Ensemble cast is excellent.  Claire Daines deserves Emmy for best Actress
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|A funny, clever film that plays around with time, repeating the same day over and over again without getting repetitive. Bill Murray is a self absorbed weather man turning up in Pennsylvania for the annual groundhog festivities, but quickly finds himself trapped as the same day keeps repeating, and he's the only one aware of it. He gives a tremendous performance that shows just how good an actor he can be, mixing some of his usual wiseguy routine with pathos, despair, and empathy for his fellow man as he goes from being an egomaniac and a jerk to ultimately becoming a better human being for it. Some of the best humour derives from his realization that there are no consequences to anything he happens to do, and Murray has tremendous chemistry with Andie MacDowell throughout the film. An exceptional film, and it holds up even better over time.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Story plot seemed to be innocent and full of hope - but sprung a major leak.<br />My hopes sprung from the anticipation of a movie that would truly bouy up the thought that hollywood could turn out an endearing film that encouraged couples, couples at any stage in their marriage, to revisit their relationship beginnings and finding the time to enjoy being with one another in mutually enjoyable settings as well as living through the rigors of everyday life.<br />This film simply focuses on the inept directions of a supposed therapist with regard to the couples lack of sex in their life as the be all end all fix for their marital woes.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I cant wait until the next one! Bravo!!<br />I think I enjoyed this more than Fifty Shades.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Grandson loves to play the Angry Birds.  This free version was worth all of the money that was spent on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this for my son and ended up getting hooked on it myself. Great game and is very addicting
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Good story, well told, with good characters, great voice work, and something for both kids and adults. It was enjoyable, didn't drag, and had a good message for kids, which is all you can ask for in a family movie. And parents will recognize the issues both they, and their kids, face as they grow. Can't ask for more complete family viewing.
1609611543|3.0|Maybe I'll finally get down to actually doing what the book says.  I know what they say is true but I have a hard time committing to leaving off wheat.  My problem, not the book's.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|If you enjoy suspense you will enjoy INTO THE DARKEST CORNER.  I will certainly look for other books by this author.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was a good movie.  I enjoyed it but I would not rate it as one of my favorites.  The ending was different.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I got seasons 1 & 2 on DVD on the basis that literally everyone I know loves Downton. I hadn't seen any of it yet. Started watching the first two episodes after work one night, and spent my entire day off watching as much as I could - so now I'm almost done already. COULDN'T STOP. Anyway this DVD set is alright, it looks nice and works well. However it seems that the first season is not HD while the second is. Also, not sure if this was due to the sound mixer on the original show or how the DVD version was set up, but the music gets really loud when there is no dialogue, haha. But I can't wait to see the rest : )
030758836X|4.0|I finished the book though I think it's been way over rated in many reviews I've read.  It's good, yeah, but I still would hesitate to say it's a must read.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Poor Layken. Her father died recently, and her mother up and moved the family across the country to cold Michigan. Things start to look up when she meets her neighbor Will. He introduces her to slamming and they seem to be starting something special. Of course, nothing can ever be that easy and it turns out he is a student teacher at Lake's school. Now they have to find a way to get along as teacher and student, while fighting their attraction.<br /><br />Layken was a likable character. She was strong and helped her mom (who worked nights as a nurse) care for her little brother. She was still heartbroken about her father's death, but was too busy \\"being there\\" for her mother and brother to really mourn him. She took her responsibilities at home seriously, but she also knew how to have fun and she had a great sense of humor. Will was also very likable, and I can definitely see how they would be perfect for each other. He was also forced to grow up way before his time, and he took those responsibilities seriously as well. He would do anything for his little brother, but he also recognized that he and Lake could have something special.<br /><br />I loved their little brothers, especially together. They were like 2 peas in a pod, and I was so glad they had each other to lean on. The first person to take Lake under her wing at the new school was Eddie, and I loved her, too. She had been through hell growing up, but she still managed to be nice, friendly and loving. She was exactly what Lake needed right then. I also loved Nick, Eddie's boyfriend. He was pretty much THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND. I was so happy Eddie had him. The one thing I didn't like was how Lake and Will's relationship became so intense so quickly. They went on 1 date (granted, it was a good date) before the truth came out, then she spent the rest of the book heartsick over not having him. I didn't really see how they could like each other that much after just 1 date. It was kind of overly dramatic.<br /><br />The story was intense, and covered much more than Lake's relationship with Will. It was not just a story about them facing down obstacles to their relationship (although there was plenty of that). It dealt with loss, friendship, parent relationships and love. And it did it so well! I'm not afraid to admit I cried at least once. Colleen has an amazing gift for making you really care about the characters and what they're going through.<br /><br />I really like the cover. The stool on the stage is perfect, as that's where some important scenes take place in the novel. It's simple and quiet.<br /><br />The sum up: I fell in love with the story, and have no doubt you will too. I can't wait to read the follow-up, which is told from Will's point of view./>The story was intense, and covered much more than Lake's relationship with Will.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book and will read others by this author.  I liked the ending even though others I have talked to thought it was soft.  I thought it was in character for Nick's character.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'ts a medical mystery that takes dr. alexander on an incredible journey as well as the reader. I couldn't put it down even on new year's eve and day. I have new thoughts about the afterlife we might all experience one day.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Didn't like it , the writing style is awful, it's mills and boon with a bit more sex, but if that's what you are looking for , look no further
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is better than the original Windows version. I run this on both my Kindle and Galaxy S3 with no problem. I've tried other versions but this is by far the best!
B004APVI1G|5.0|I've watched several 3D blu rays at home, this movie now sits as the standard for how 3D should look.  Visually the film looks stunning.  There's lots of great 3D effects and unlike some other films, the 3D actually enhances the film to give the world it's based in a complete look and feel.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The book was confusing and I simply did not like it. It got boring very quickly. The minute I thought there was a good part, the author did't expand on it. I didn't even finish the book. It wasn't the bad and it wasn't that good either !
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I found the book okay. Typical Nicholas Sparks novel. It was an easy read while on vacation that required little thought and took my mind off my own life for awhile. But I wouldn't call it a classic by any means.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|The app is free to download.  It then charges you $1.99 to unlock like most games.  But that only gets you so far.  It then charges you $4.99 to unlock the rest of the game!  So misleading!  I'm never buying a G5 game again!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is a fun musical with a deep story to it. I have watched it since I was a child, with my mother. And now, I watch it with my son:) Julie Andrews is always a delight, as well as the rest of the cast. A wonderful classic, and the HD looks great!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My 14 year old daughter read this in 2 days! She loved it. My son is also reading it. They both have read the other books by the same author and couldn't wait to start.
B005K17RU0|5.0|User friendly, nice display and I like that it has 15 day outlook. Highly recommend this app. Well worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best tv series ever.  I look forward to each new episode.  The BBC really knows how to put on a series,<br />Sets are gorgeous as well as the costumes and the acting is  exceptional.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book I've ever read OMG if any wait till  the fourth book comes out. Rick you are the author ever. I really don't wanna wait till Nov for the fourth book to come out
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  Francine Jay had some good ideas on minimalizing your life.  So, if you are in need of getting rid of all of the junk you've been hauling around with you for years... give this a read.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest but what's the point of looking at it if you can't repine the stuff you like? this app will let you look at pinterest and you can like stuff on it but repinning things is so extremely difficult! its really next to impossible! quite annoying.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I got this to stream a favorite radio station after trying iHeart radio and having multiple drops and pauses. I put the stations stream url into XiiaLive and I get drop-free perfect sounding radio.  I've also pulled up NPR from around the nation- cool app, lots of shoutcast streams to choose from.
1583334386|5.0|I have read many books on human behavior and I would say this is the absolute best.  Great mixture of research, facts and real world situations along with an easy read. Other than books to help us grow spiritually and draw from God's resources to overcome I don't think there is a better book on the planet than this one!  You will find it very enlightening as to why we do what we do.  It was Paul the Apostle that said \\"I want to do good but there is a law in my body that makes me do things I don't want to do\\".  Paul goes on to give the final answer of how to overcome but it is nice to have a book that lets us know what's going on with that law in our body.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This product has a real quality feel as you open each layer.  It was a great Christmas gif for Mom even though she already owns the DVD.  After unwrapping the paper, she looked all over the nice outer box.  Then the box itself, when opened, gives that high-end luxury feel with little details starting with an inner protective sheet.  If you've ever opened high-end Microsoft hardware (like a Zune), you know how this feels.  It's not a bunch of cheap plastic inside.<br /><br />The content itself is wonderful for any Sound Of Music enthusiast.  You can read all about it in the product descrition.  For the price, this limited edition set of paraphernalia make a perfect gift.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i use the web for youtube but this app is the best for downloading music. but i suggest using the web for videos
B00004YM0D|5.0|I love this album. Watched the movie and enjoyed the music so much that I wanted the sound track. Really good with some well known tracks.
0803726570|5.0|Kindness, openness and creativity are gently emphasized in this delightful rhyming story for the young and the not so young.
B008476HBM|5.0|Have always wanted to read this and finally doing it.  I am only about 20% into it but am enjoying it and finding it hard to put down.  Had seen the movie but as in all movies the book fills in the gaps!  Definitely recommend: A good insight to English life style along with a good read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Many of my friends were reading this book and gave it raving reviews so I decidwd to give it a shot. I am really glad I did because this book is amazing! It made me laugh, and cry. It is my definition of perfection. I havent seen the movie yet but im positive, it can not compare to the<br />book.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I watched this movie online and I liked it very much. So I bought its DVD as a gift to a friend. I did not check the extra features included in the DVD but the movie is definitely great.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|An enjoyable book.  Not a great literary achievement, but a good Saturday afternoon diversion.  (6 more words required to publish... clearly brevity is not valued.)
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I have not seen it in action but my 5 year old nephew was very excited when he opened it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|there's nothing super exiting about this game but its worth the buy. its one of those games were once u.  play... you cant put it down.

B00A3ATW4M|5.0|This album has a great songlist. I dont quite understand why its called season 4 volume 1, it should have been volume 8. I recommend it to all gleeks.
B0026772N8|4.0|Very Interesting Book.  Sometimes its a difficult read, but it was fun and really made you think.  How the character zones and just thinks for hours at a time and where his mind wanders to is very interesting.  It a fun journey with a lot of lessons to be learned for practical use in life and engineering.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fabulous, fantastic, I love this site...I have gotten sooo many ideas already and will continue to follow my peps on there.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather forecast at my fingertips! I use it to determine what the weather will be in another state when I'm planning to see my daughter play lacrosse in college ... 100 miles away.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I feel as though this was written for a slightly younger audience, but it didn't keep me from turning the pages. Some reviews say this belongs in the canon of great literature, and while I wouldn't go that far, it holds up as a very accessible and relevant bit of sci-fi.
030758836X|4.0|***SPOILER ALERT***  I've heard SO much about this book and I decided to give it a shot.  It was great, I loved how it kept me guessing and I kept wanting to think it was Nick, but then knew it couldn't be, etc.  Some of the parts were REALLY drawn out, and I would've rather had the ending be extended for him to finally get the evidence he needed to lock Amy up than the 30 pages describing Tanner's office, etc.  And the pregnancy thing?  It didn't surprise me, knowing what Amy was capable of, but it was just so quick.  Wish it had a different ending, oh well.  I would love to read her Dark Places book, but I heard there's really bad animal abuse in it and I can't read that!
B008X9Z37A|3.0|It's fine - nothing fancy - serviceable - I didn't need anything fancy or expensive - just something to protect the kindle when I take it somewhere.
B005LAII80|4.0|It seems that comics have become the mainstay in films these days. With the success of the film adaptations of Marvel characters and Batman, more comic book characters are making their way to the screen. Fans of the British comic 2000 A.D. are well acquainted with Judge Dredd. Not the one we saw years ago with Sylvester Stallone (not bad but no, not like the comic), but the comic character. Dredd is the quintessential tough guy. He takes no guff and deals out justice with extreme prejudice. So that makes him perfect for a new film, this time just known as DREDD.<br /><br />In the future most of the world is a desolate wasteland. Only 2 cities remain the main one of which is Mega-City One. It is a city filled with people and that means plenty of crime. Crime is so rampant in fact that they've tossed aside the old ways of doing things and now have just one authority in this world: judges. Judges fit everything into one tight package: police officer, judge and executioner. There is no need for a trial, if you break the law the judge will arrest and sentence you on the spot. If you do something as extreme as murder, your execution will take place on the streets with clean up to follow.<br /><br />One of the most extreme members of this police force is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban). He also happens to be the most effective officer they have. His day today will be different though as he's been assigned a special task: take a new recruit who barely passed the admissions test but has something special about her, telepathy, and rate her performance. If she's effective, she's in but if she fails, she's gone. Dredd meets up with new Judge Anderson (Olivia Thrilby) and off they go.<br /><br />The film goes for the usual here with the gruff old timer giving the newbie a difficult time. Their first case results in a chase involving a group of drug users racing through town. While Dredd kills a few of these criminals, the rest escape into one of the skyscraper type neighborhoods.<br /><br />The deaths of the criminals who escaped in a skyscraper type neighborhood leads the Judges to that building.  It turns out to be run by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), one of the most vicious criminals and drug lords in Mega City One. Ma-Ma is in the process of promoting a new drug to the streets called Slo-mo, a drug that when taken makes the user experience the world in slow motion. When she learns that the Judges have entered the building, she immediately has it shut down and locked up tight and then offers a huge reward for the first person to bring both Judges to her.<br /><br />This forces the Dredd and Anderson to work their way up the floors of the building in search of Ma-Ma before anyone can collect that reward. And along the way the body count rises as every criminal in the building, and there are plenty of them, tries to collect. Unfortunately for them they have yet to realize how resourceful and deadly Dredd truly is. To put it mildly, Dredd makes Dirty Harry look like a kindergarten cop.<br /><br />Those of you who recall the review I wrote for a film called THE RAID might think this sounds vaguely familiar and in part it is. Both films have law enforcement officials trapped in a skyscraper filled with criminals out to collect a bounty on their heads. But this one does have a number of differences. While THE RAID had a tad more realism in how its heroes found a way to survive, DREDD has the title character who is the supreme tough guy. Dredd doesn't think twice about shooting someone, he just does it. Anderson also is a plus as her telepathic abilities help them to find out more about just where they're going when they question a captive drug dealer.<br /><br />If you're an action fan you'll love this movie, the same for fans of the comic. Gone are the humorous touches found in the last version of Dredd, replaced by a performance that is more in line with the comic book. Urban does a fantastic job here, never once feeling the need to remove the classic helmet Dredd wears to show off his smile, grimace or anything else. This is what Dredd should look like and how he should be played. Thrilby does a nice job as well showing her frustration at being judged by someone who clearly has no use for her only to later be the sidekick that he needs.<br /><br />The movie is filled to the brim with movie violence. Don't rent this one not having a clue about that. Just like the comic, the movie is filled with splatter moments and the blood gushes freely here. It's not a film for the squeamish. But for movie fans, comic fans and Dredd fans, you'll enjoy this movie much more than the Stallone version.et Dredd wears to show off his smile, grimace or anything else.

0765325950|5.0|A brilliant and incredibly epic ending to a series I have been reading over the last nine years! I do not like to include spoilers so I will not give away any of the plot here, but: couldn't have asked for a better done book, I literally could not stop reading it (with the exception of sleep) from the moment it arrived! I sure it will have the same effect on many others!

It is filled with information and drills/workouts and how to do proper form to avoid injury. Some material in here is debatable on like how to run \\"correctly\\" but that's for you to decide on. If you want to build your base and add strength I suggest looking through this book.

B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|With so many remakes and sequels being made these days it's nice to have some being made that are actually well done. More often than not these types of films are rushed into production and rarely come close to being as original or fun as the first films. Such is not the case with MEN IN BLACK 3.<br /><br />Believe it or not it's been 10 years since the last film in this series. Agents K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) are still cleaning up alien disasters on Earth and saving mankind even though mankind has no clue that it's going on. The head of their organization, Zed, has passed away and the memorial for him is less than, well, memorable. J still can't get K to open up. And then a crisis happens.<br /><br />At the prison facility on the moon, the worst scum of outer space has broken loose. Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped. Captured and put in this prison as well as having his arm shot off by K 40 years ago, Boris wants nothing more than revenge. His plan is to escape, get back to Earth and go back in time to make sure K never gets past their original meeting.<br /><br />All of this happens with the exception of J remembering K like nothing has changed. When he goes to work, no one there understands why he thinks K is his partner since K was killed 40 years earlier. That is until he talks to O (Emma Thompson). She realizes that time has been altered. When an attack on Earth by Boris and the rest of the group from his planet begins, J must go back in time to make sure that he doesn't have the chance to alter things thus saving not only the world by K as well.<br /><br />The first thing that makes this work so well is the story. It's not a rehash of past films and gives us something new to consider. It also allows the closeness between the two partners be developed a little more. While K displays nothing, deep down you catch glimpses of his fondness for J.<br /><br />The second thing that makes this movie click is the performance by Josh Brolin as the young K. Not only does his appearance almost uncannily like that of Jones, he has his mannerisms and speech patterns down to a T. At times you might find yourself thinking that this is indeed a young Tommy Lee Jones and wonder how they were actually able to go back in time to get him for this part. But the fact is it's just that great of a performance by Brolin.<br /><br />Both Jones and Smith play their roles like there's been no time between the last film and this one. Jones continues to offer the most deadpan of stoic faces and Smith has the sarcastic quick wit of Agent J down like it's his normal way of behaving.<br /><br />Once again the special effects are fantastic and will have you pausing the DVD to get a better glimpse of each and every alien. Some seem to look familiar and others new, but each one is original and helps to create a realistic look for the encounters they have with the agents.<br /><br />More than anything this movie offers you a lot of fun. It's not as serious as the topic might sound even though any invasion of Earth by another life form from space would be quite serious. The laughs come easily and the drama that underlies the whole story, J's closeness and attachment to K, make it a complete story. If you want entertainment when renting, or buying, this week then you won't go wrong with this one.the young K.

B009POCG2C|4.0|Can Clint Eastwood actually make a bad movie? I'm beginning to think it's impossible. I went back to check out the list of movies he's starred in over the past several decades and while I found one or two that weren't my taste and maybe one other that was just different I couldn't actually find one I would say was terrible. Remarkably at 82 his record remains intact with the new release TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.<br /><br />Here Eastwood plays Gus, a baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. Gus is getting older and beginning to have problems with his eyesight, something he needs to do his job. The franchise is looking for smarter ways to decide who to sign and Gus is in competition with Phillip (Matthew Lillard) and his computer stats style of knowing which players to sign.<br /><br />Running along side this story is that of Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), a top notch lawyer who is on the fast track to partnership. If Mickey can win the latest case she's in charge of then she's almost guaranteed a partnership at the firm. But things with Gus will find these two crossing paths that are not well traveled between father and daughter.<br /><br />The two have issues with one another that stem back from years before. When Gus' friend Pete (John Goodman) begins to think Gus might have a problem, he calls on Mickey to help him out and to make sure Gus is all right. While Gus doesn't want this so called babysitter with him on his latest trip to scout out a hot prospect, Mickey goes anyway hoping that perhaps she can get some answers to the questions she's had most of her life about her father.<br /><br />Eastwood's Gus is a cantankerous sort who is unwilling to admit that there is something wrong. He does have the occasional moment when he lets down his guard to his daughter but he's determined to be on his own and do things his way like he always has. Adam's Mickey is just as stubborn as her father and attempts to give him plenty of opportunities to open up but those moments don't seem to be happening. How they resolve these problems that have developed over years on a three day road trip makes for interesting viewing and touches the heart as well.<br /><br />Included in this mix is Justin Timberlake as Johnny, an ex-ball player that Gus signed up years before but whose career has changed over the years. Having thrown out his arm, he's now a talent scout as well. He still gets along great with Gus and as the days go by begins to develop some feelings for Mickey as well.<br /><br />While the movie is centered around the world of baseball make no mistake, it's not baseball that is the film's focus. This film is about the lives of two people who should be connected from the start but whose lives have taken them down different paths away from one another. While they both should find comfort and ease with one another their lives offer little of either. It is this path that they've gone down for years that has driven them apart and has left them with emotional scars that they won't easily repair.<br /><br />There isn't a bad piece of acting in this entire film. Adams does a great job as Mickey, trying to solve the problems that she's built up over the years. Timberlake has grown on me over the past few years showing that he can be a dynamite actor given the chance. The surprising thing for me in this film was Eastwood though. Always teased about a monotone delivery and for his use of silence more than speaking, the character of Gus is given plenty of life in Eastwood's performance here. One sequence involving him visiting his wife's grave was particularly touching and totally different than anything I've ever seen him do before.<br /><br />When this film came out I wasn't sure that I actually wanted to see it. I held off on it even when it came out on DVD but thought finally why not. I'm glad I did. This was one of the most enjoyable dramas I've seen in some time. It also proves that while Eastwood is getting older, he's also still one of thebest movie stars around today.best movie stars around today.

B005LAII3A|4.0|Let it be known that I was a fan of the movie TOTAL RECALL that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger back in 1990. It was a great science fiction film filled with plenty of action, top notch special effects and of course the use of cute quips by Arnold. It's still a good movie to watch and enjoyed. So count me among the surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the remake that comes out this week on DVD as much as if not more than the original.<br /><br />For those who don't know here's the story: The Earth is overrun with people and only two areas that are now able to support life, one in what we know of as England run by Cohaggen and another in what was once Australia. To get from one point to the other you board \\"The Fall\\", a skyscraper size ship that passes through a tunnel from one area to the other. The folks at the Aussie end are protesting their abuse at the hands of the others and use \\"The Fall\\" as a symbol of their life of servitude. Matthius (Bill Nighy) is their rebel leader, demanding a release by the people in the English area.<br /><br />Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) works in a factory that builds robot security troops for Cohaggen. He continues to have nightmares about a escaping the police with a woman he doesn't recognize (Jessica Biel). He wakes each night beside his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) unable to explain his dream other than to say it felt so real. Feeling as if something is missing in his life, he sees an ad for a company called Rekall.<br /><br />Going to Rekall, Doug learns that it's a vacation that takes place in the brain. Rekall injects you with drugs and implants memories into your brain that make you feel as if you've experienced the travel dream of your choice, as long as you've never actually been involved in your choice in real life. Doug chooses the life of a spy but as he begins to go through the process the machines alerts the officials that he actually was a spy. Before he can argue the point the door burst in and a security team sweeps in killing the Rekall members and attempting to capture Doug. Except that his natural instincts kick in and he takes out the entire team and escapes.<br /><br />Unaware of what is going on, Doug continues to try and escape the police and get home. Once there he is comforted by Lori who suddenly turns on him and tries to kill him. While they fight she lets him know this is not the happy home he though, that they were never married and that she was sent to watch him in case he remembered anything other than the implants the government placed in his brain. Doug escapes Lori and the chase is on. With little to go on and secretive clues that he apparently left himself, Doug is trying to find out first what is going on and second where he fits into the whole scheme of things.<br /><br />So what makes this version different from the original? First off the amount of action involved. This film is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. At the same time it offers enough story to carry it along as well rather than opt for non-stop gunplay and running.  Most intriguing is the fact that you wonder till very near the end if this is all really happening or if it's all a part of the Rekall experience that Doug asked for. Is he really Doug or a double agent? And what about the girl in his dreams, where does she fit in to all of what is going on? If you've seen the original you know the answer, if not then you'll keep wondering until all is revealed.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest change from this movie to the original is the setting and motivation for the action being seen. It no longer takes place on Mars and doesn't revolve around generators that create an atmosphere there. Instead it sticks to this planet and problems between two areas that represent what is left of Earth. For me that didn't ruin the film at all. And perhaps that's why it didn't feel like so much of a complete remake and more like a re-imagining instead.<br /><br />Ferrell does much better in this remakethan last years FRIGHT NIGHT which missed completely. He does a great job as the confused Quaid. Beckinsale and Biel do tremendous as well moving from love interests to action stars in the blink of an eye. Having done so before my guess is both will continue to do so in the future and do it well.<br /><br />It's been 20 years since the original film was released so I'm certain that there is a generation out there that's never seen that film who will enjoy this one on its own merits. Fans of the original, if they allow themselves to forget that film, will find this one entertaining as well. For me its one that I know I will have no problem pulling it out and watching again; it's that good.than last years FRIGHT NIGHT which missed completely. He does a great job as the confused Quaid.

B005LAII8A|4.0|\\"Time travel has not yet been invented but 30 years from now, it will have been.\\" Thus begins the movie LOOPER, a science fiction action film that takes on time travel in a different way than most. The movie starts just a few years from now and people from the future have become involved in the present. With no way for future gangsters to dispose of people they send them back in time to be killed and disposed of. The people in our time who do this job are known as loopers.<br /><br />Loopers wait at a designated area and time. When the intended shows up, they shoot them, wrap them up and then take the body to a burning disposal unit. They are paid well to do the job and down the line must eventually kill their own future self with a higher paid out at that time.<br /><br />Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of the best loopers. He follows instructions and never looks back, making plans to one day travel to France when he retires. His friend Seth (Paul Dano) isn't quite as well groomed for the job. Seth shows up at Joe's house one night on the run. It turns out that his latest victim was his future self and he let him escape. Now the gatmen (those armed with revolvers instead of the blunderbuss that Loopers use) are tracking him down to eliminate both him and his future self.<br /><br />Joe gives them an assist rather than find himself on the bad end of a bullet and continues on his way. The victims keep coming back but then Joe finds himself in the same shoes as Seth. The future Joe (Bruce Willis) is now in his sites but he hesitates. That's all it takes for future Joe to make an escape and leave current Joe on the run for his life. Trying to set things straight by killing future Joe won't be easy since your current strategy is all past history to him.<br /><br />Current and future Joes meet at a diner they both love to get things straight. For current Joe to survive he must kill his future self. But future Joe lets him know that things aren't what they seem. Not only will his life change for the better but someone close to him will die if he doesn't change the past. On top of that a crime boss in the future is having all the loopers disposed of from the future so he will stand unopposed. Only finding this man in the past and killing him will set things in the future right.<br /><br />Both are bound and determined to get their own way. Future Joe wants to save the world and his true love. Current Joe doesn't care, he just wants to survive. But as the film progresses both men learn something about the world and about themselves.<br /><br />As the gatmen try to track them both down they take two divergent paths to try and affect things. Future Joe is searching for the child who will become the future criminal mastermind. When he does he will kill him. But a part of the map he made ended in the hands of current Joe who sets out to protect the child and at the same time finish his looper contract.<br /><br />The map leads him to a remote farmhouse where he finds Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Could this be the threat to the world of the future? Joe doesn't know but he does know that his future self will eventually end up here with the intent to kill. And the only one Joe wants to see dead is his future self.<br /><br />Don't let it fool you this isn't as complicated as it might seem. What it is is a dynamite sci-fi thriller that keeps you guessing from the start and doesn't let go until almost the last minute of the film. There are no easy answers here just as there are none in life. The story that seems simple yet becomes more complex with each passing minute is one that will hold your interest and never let go.<br /><br />The acting here is amazing. Gordon-Levitt has the mannerisms of Willis down pat. He's become an actor that is bound for more amazing roles and performances and this one just adds to his list. Willis could perform this role without breaking a sweat and he does a great job here. Blunt is goodas always, giving those subtle nuances a twist to make her character deeper than one would expect.<br /><br />Some would say that this is nothing more than a TERMINATOR rehash without robots but they would be wrong. There is more going on with these characters than in that film. There is a deeper meaning to the lives being lived and changed here. And by the end of the film there will perhaps be just a touch of humanity worth saving.as always, giving those subtle nuances a twist to make her character deeper than one would expect.<br /><br />Some would say that this is nothing more than a TERMINATOR rehash without robots but they would be wrong.

B0099114WO|4.0|To begin with the title of the film HOPE SPRINGS is not a location. Rather it is about the hope that after years of marriage love and emotion can return. It's what the film is about. While some will watch and assume as the discussions involved talk about sex, that isn't what's at the core of the film.<br /><br />Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) have been happily married for years now. But times have changed. Anniversary gifts are now just shared items they need for the house. Arnold hasn't slept in the same bed with Kay for years now starting from a back injury he suffered long ago. This is a couple that has a daily routine where Arnold wakes, gets ready and goes to work with Kay making sure his day starts off with the same breakfast every morning and a peck on the cheek. But that's not enough for Kay.<br /><br />Kay longs for the affection and intimacy that the couples shared all those years ago. Determined to do something about it, she seeks out marriage counseling books at the local book store and comes across one written by Dr. Feld (Steve Carell). Digging deeper she finds his website online and then makes reservations for her and Arnold who of course refuses to go seeing it as a waste of money. Kay gives him two options: join her at the airport or stay home alone.<br /><br />Fearing he might lose her, Arnold shows up begrudgingly. They arrive on a remote small town in Maine where their week long couples retreat is to take place. Arnold is the crotchety type who complains about the costs of everything, insisting all the while that they have no reason to be here.<br /><br />As their sessions begin Dr. Feld talks to them about what the problem seems to be. Carell plays the role straight and doesn't resort to what some would expect of him. Feld cares about the people he treats and allows them to bring out the questions and answers that are plaguing their marriage. Where the obvious questions about their sex lives are discussed, you can tell by the direction he leads the couple in his questions and what he discusses with them it's not sex he wants them to dig deeper into. It's intimacy. It's the small caress that Arnold might brush across Kay's cheek or a kiss on the lips. But these topics don't come out at the first session, instead taking time each day they are there.<br /><br />One of the best things here is that the story unwinds and we discover that it's not all Arnold's fault that things have changed. One would think that was the case with the attitude he has toward the whole process and with some of the answers he provides. What we have here is a couple in every sense of the word where both share equally in the changes that have overtaken their lives. And the only way to save this marriage is for both to become an active part in that marriage once again.<br /><br />This movie isn't the dry film that it might sound like from what I've written so far. It's filled with lots of humor and out right affection seen in the characters offered. These seem like real people you and I know in real life, people that have a deep rooted love for one another yet have somehow lost touch. You care about both characters and watch hoping that they find the solution they need.<br /><br />Long time readers will know I've never been a big Meryl Streep fan but here she does a tremendous job, offering not just great readings of her lines but displaying subtle touches like body movement and longing glances that open up her character. I've always found her performances much better in roles like these than grandiose characters she has played in the past. Jones is amazing to watch. He has the grizzled old coot character down pat and if that were all he displayed here I would say his performance was mailed in. But as the film progresses you see that there is a weakness inside of him that blooms and allows his affections to finally show in this character. Since neither of these characters is in your face, my guess is both performances will be ignored come Oscar time.<br /><br />As I near the age that these two people are in the midst of, the movie made me look back at my own life and will do the same for anyone in their 40s on. Young viewers might want to look at it and realize what they can expect down the line unless they pay close attention. In any event this movie was a delight, offering insight into what is truly important in the lives and love of people. It touches on many levels and it is definitely a movie worth watching.ill be ignored come Oscar time.<br /><br />As I near the age that these two people are in the midst of, the movie made me look back at my own life and will do the same for anyone in their 40s on.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I have read the first 4 books in this series and these characters have become my family. The historical references are a great learning tool or reminder of what I know of history. The characters are rich, honest, likeable (sometimes), challenging, and have great depth. I plan to read all of Diane's books and am beginning on the 5th one now. Thank you for many hours of reading(I love long books) and lots of interesting information that I might not have learned without your books. Most of all these books and characters have gotten me through some very difficult challenges over the past year.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book is the only one I have ever read that follows a pyramidal plot structure. The story is told through a series of books, letters and journals by seven different characters. Each successive character is placed farther forward in the chronology, then when the final character is reached, the story descends through the characters a second time, wrapping up all the cliffhangers accrued during the first time through. The author masterfully writes dramatically different characters, who each differ in their speech patterns. Overall, this book is wonderful and is one of the more fascinating books I have read this year.
B009IQG5LK|3.0|Has it really been 22 years since DICK TRACY was came out on film? I find that stunning. It seems like only yesterday that the film came out and that this comic strip character made his way to the screen once again.<br /><br />Warren Beatty directs the film and stars as the title character, a totally dedicated police detective who battles crime with every waking breath. Tracy's long time girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly) sticks close to Tracy's side at all times and waits patiently for the day he will finally propose to her. In the line of duty Tracy comes across a homeless young boy named The Kid (Charlie Korsomo) that he takes under his wing with the help of Tess.<br /><br />But like most crime fighters in comics it is Tracy's rogue's gallery that makes him stand out. Top of the list is Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino), the crime boss who has control of every criminal in the city. Among these criminals you'll find the likes of Flattop (William Forsythe), Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), Pruneface (R.G.Armstrong) and more, all appearing just like their names and identical to the way they appeared in the comic strip. Big Boy has set his sights on taking over the entire underworld of the city and accomplishes this with ease, causing problems for Tracy and his team.<br /><br />In addition to taking over the underworld, Big Boy has laid claim to the town's fanciest nightclub and its star attraction, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna). No one in town can sing a torch song like Breathless and even Tracy finds himself stunned into silence when in her presence.<br /><br />As any competition that goes up against Big Boy disappears, Tracy and his group find it more and more difficult to actually catch him in the act. Witnesses disappear and cement shoes are given to more than one problem that Big Boy faces, but Tracy is the die hard detective who will stop at nothing to put an end to Big Boy and his gang.<br /><br />The thing about this movie is that it's not the plot that keeps you watching. It's the visualization of a comic book page come to life on the big screen. Beatty made some wise decisions when he made this film having the sets made as simply and as bright as possible even when the lighting is low. This is the four color template used in comics that we've all grown up with and it's used for perfect effect in this film.<br /><br />He also made a wise decision with the make up here, choosing to make the characters appear just like they did in the comic strip as well. Flattop actually has a flat head. Pruneface has more wrinkles than a shar pei. These characters were there in the comic strip and later in the cartoons of Tracy as well. Here they come to life.<br /><br />The action is violent at times but more in a comic book style than in most mobster movies seen these days. Granted some kids will find the bad guys scary looking but more for their appearance than their actions.<br /><br />The one disappointing thing about the film is Beatty's choice to play Tracy as himself rather than the same makeup he gives the other actors. Tracy was noted for his hawk nose and jutting jaw line. Beatty has chosen to simply outfit himself in Tracy's bright yellow coat and hat with no altering make up at all. With the bad guys all decked out, why not Tracy as well.<br /><br />The blu-ray release offers a fantastic look to this film making the colors, the centerpiece of the film, seem to pop right off the screen. Unfortunately it doesn't offer anything in the way of extras but fans of the film will just be content to finally have the chance to add it to their collection.

DICK TRACY isn't just a film to rent for a night, this is one to add to your shelf to be taken down and enjoyed from time to time.

B009ANP4F4|3.0|I'm coming into the whole STEP UP scene further down the line than I'd like to admit. This is the first movie in the series that I've actually watched. From what I've been able to look up this is either the fourth film in the series. If they have all been like this then they're entertaining enough but nothing spectacular.<br /><br />This time around we have a group of young people who love to dance and are seeking to win a competition for flash mob dancing being sponsored on the internet. For those who don't know a flash mob involves a group of people who prepare for a dance performance but don't have a stage to perform on. Instead they show up unannounced with no warning and suddenly you have a group of people burst into dance in everyday settings. When the film opens the group stop traffic on a coastal Miami street, pop up their sound equipment in seconds and begin dancing on top of, around and over cars in the street. Timed to make sure they can get away without being caught, the break down and take off.<br /><br />The leader of the crew is Eddy. Not professionally trained, Eddy works at a local hotel along with several other members of the crew. Their current goal is to get more hits for their street performance than any other crew and to win a large cash award and contract via the competition sponsored online.<br /><br />While on break at the hotel Eddy meets a young girl named Penelope who has some dance moves of her own. What he doesn't know is that her father is the owner of the hotel. Not only do we have a boy from the wrong side of the tracks meets girl who lives in posh surroundings here, we have another problem when Penelope's father releases the news that he intends to buy out the neighborhood where Eddy and his friends live to turn it into a resort area.<br /><br />Love will conquer all though. Even the problems that pop up when Eddy's best friend nearly ruins the potential for the crew to win the competition when he becomes jealous of Penelope. What he doesn't realize is that she's on their side and that the time she's been spending with Eddy was to help her realize her dream of performing with a high profile dance troupe there in Miami. Sure it lead to romance but there was no plan to harm the crew.<br /><br />While this set up may sound simple that's because in effect it is simple. The story is small and the dialogue weak but that's not what people going to see the STEP UP films are there for. They're there to watch the young dancers spin, jump, pop up and krunk in various settings Its all about dancing and watching some talented people do it to the best of their ability. The plotlines here are no more in depth than the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland \\"hey kids let's put on a show!\\" plots. Its all about the dancing.<br /><br />That's not to say it's a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining. The dancing is well done and the music will have you toe tapping in seconds. No, this is not a movie that I would mark my calendar to go see, but as a rental for a night that will entertain, especially those who are dance fans, you can't go wrong with this one.e doesn't realize is that she's on their side and that the time she's been spending with Eddy was to help her realize her dream of performing with a high profile dance troupe there in Miami.

145210655X|4.0|&#34;Darth Vader & Son&#34; a wonderful gift to a &#34;Star Warsy&#34; son! My husband gave this to our 27 yr old son for Christmas, chuckles were abundant!
B008L1DNGI|5.0|i've tried to find a way to play this game for years, it was the first game i ever played on the Dreamcast and i'm happy that Sega is finally re-releasing their amazing lineup of DC titles.  memories!
B005HSL626|5.0|I have put countless hours into this game, I simply can't stop!  The graphics are beautiful and the touch screens ability to track your finger for movement is on target.  Challenges are tough but realistically established as well.  I find this to be a great stress reliever from the pains of everyday life.
B009MO57H6|3.0|So let's be honest here. As the series of RESIDENT EVIL movies has progressed they've become less about being a real movie and more about being a visualization of the first person shooter game that began the whole thing. That was starting to show in the last film but in this current release it becomes even more apparent.<br /><br />Picking up immediately where the last film left off we once more have items tossed our direction as the film lives up to it's 3-D hype with weapons tossed about and at the audience every so often to make sure you're paying attention. If you're not watching it in 3-D (I wasn't) then you just see items tossed at the camera and don't feel the need to duck every few minutes.<br /><br />We learn a little more about Alice (Mila Javovich) but not much and once again she finds herself captured and unconscious. With the help of Ada Wong she escapes, arms herself and begins the carnage. A white hallway filled with zombie types soon finds itself splattered in red with dead bodies left and right. But of course Alice escapes.<br /><br />Alice learns that the Umbrella Corporation is sitting back and watching the T virus run rampant across the globe, doing nothing to stop it. I always found this a little odd since most corporations' goals are to achieve wealth and power and a world over run by zombies would provide neither not to mention no fuel or sustainable food source. But that's logic talking.<br /><br />Somehow Alice ends up working with her arch enemy from the series, Wesker, who sees some of the problems that have arisen. Instead of being pitted against him she is now pitted against the Red Queen, the computer that looks like a child in holographic image seen in the first film. A team sent in to help Alice is on the way but of course she stops to help a little girl who thinks Alice is her mother since a clone of Alice was with her earlier. Trust me if you watch it it makes sense. Then again the girl is a clone as well. There are tons of clones in this series.<br /><br />What I've offered here is more plot than is actually seen here. Most of it is offered in bits and pieces throughout the 96 minute running time. This film isn't about plot though, it's about action and there is plenty of that here. Well action and CGI creatures that want Alice dead. Some of the main creatures from the original game show up here rendered nicely via CGI.<br /><br />But that's the thing that might be the downfall of this film series. It has less and less to do with story and more and more to do with just all out action. Don't get me wrong, I love action films. But it's much more fun to see an action film based around a story. This movie feels like your sitting beside someone playing the game and watching how they do.<br /><br />While not the most terrible film I've ever seen it doesn't leave me much hope for another film. And the ending of this one like all the rest leaves it wide open for a cataclysmic last chapter. If it happens I might watch for a $2 rental but I doubt I'd shell out the bucks to own it, even if I wanted a complete series on my shelf.n this series.<br /><br />What I've offered here is more plot than is actually seen here.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really love this book and you should definitely read it if you like freaky adventure stories, sort of like Harry Potter. l would recommend it for around 13  year olds. I loved the old photos and letters because it adds  creativity and life to book. Some people may say that they are hard to see on a kindle but you can easily zoom in on them( on a kindle fire) by holding down on the photo and clicking zoom. There is some bad language in the book but I just ignore it because it doesn't make any difference to the great story. Hopefully there will be a sequel to this book because it felt a bit unfinished I can't wait to read the next book!! (If there is one!)<br />I'm not going to tell you the whole story but I'll tell you that this book was really great and hard to put down.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|I try to always buy with goHastings. Every movie I've bought from them has been in tip top shape but my spirits sank when I opened my copy of SuckerPunch. There was water/condensation damage to the cover. The paper stuck to the plastic and ripped off. It looks shoddy and beat up, not to mention someone wrote their name on the plastic in Sharpie. The front looks fine though all this damage is to the back. I bought it used but still...you guys are so much better than this.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love that it shows the percentage remaining on the battery.  Also love that it gives usage time estimates for various tasks.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|One of the best game I played in along time but it don't load after the maskes are placed  so that part I don't care for but will keep tryin

B005G4TJUC|5.0|It was in perfect condition, no skips either. I don't remember if I bought it used or new but other way there were no problems.

B00AMBH70S|1.0|This movie had next to no plot that lamely tried to tie itself with the prequels by spraying in scenes from the other movies.  All throughout the movie, I kept asking myself \\"what is the purpose?\\"  This will be the last Bourne film I waste my money on.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book is so special to those of us that have had a loved one suffer through a stroke.  Especially one that affects their speech.<br />Never being sure what my mother understood and just praying I was doing the right thing for her.  Thank you Ms Taylor for setting my mind at rest. I know now, she felt the love even though I didn't provide enough &#34;quite time&#34; for her.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game!  I goes quickly.  I hope it will improve my eye/hand coordination.  The free version is good!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|This movie had such cool potential but fell short in every way.  The premise is familiar, the underdog (good guys) take on the returning champs (bad guys) and dream of winning it all with the same tired routine until the new kid on the block (the rebel and good guy at heart behind the rough exterior) shakes things up.  Sound like Bring It On to you?  Yeah, me too so I was looking forward to that sort of spunk from the characters. What was delivered was more like Bring It On 6, straight to DVD.  THe only ones that might find it enjoyable are teens in high school because they may see themselves in it or former members of a chorus team that are still living vicariously through pathetic B movies.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is, by far, one of the most addictive games that you can play on the Kindle Fire.  It has endless replayability and will keep you entertained for hours.  Well worth the price.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a surprisingly great game.  Dozens of courses, each with its own twists.  It is really a puzzle game - and it is fun to play the courses again and again and improve to where you shoot under par and unlock the next course.  Very fun, and many hours of play.  Highly recommended.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|great product, exactly what i was looking for! bought for my 5 year old grand daughter. I had ask her where all her barbies were and she answered, &#34; I don't know where those girls are.&#34; Now she can keep them all together. She loves it.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Accurate and easy to use. Locks in to the pin easily and gives you a yardage right away. It really helps your game when you know the exact distance to the hole.
0385535147|5.0|Bought for my wife....She says that John Grisham does it again.  This book is a great thriller, full of suspense and twists.  She says she really enjoyed it.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Great coice of songs and poetry. His musicians and accompanying artists were just right. It's nice to have the concert recorded live in London.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I saw this in theaters and loved it. I am very happy with this purchase! Would reccomend to others. Enjoy!
B004KKX80A|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted.  The product is fast and works well with other parts from other Beyblades.  I customized it within a few minutes to work perfectly for me.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I've been downloading and trying out games on my Kindle Fire since I first got a Fire for Christmas last year (Dec. '11).  There have been some fun games, but most of them were pretty weak.  THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  It's not that it's my favorite game in the world, but it's by far the best implementation on the Kindle Fire platform I've ever seen.<br /><br />Playing this on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" is a blast.  I kind of stink at it, but I like the challenge.<br /><br />You steer your car by tilting the Kindle from side to side.  The controls really work perfectly.<br /><br />The gameplay itself is very good.  The levels are challenging and the graphics are done well.  The interface has a fun retro feel to it.<br /><br />If you like driving games, you should definitely give this one a try.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|This show became less about constructing an actual horror story and more about throwing shock factor after visceral shock factor at the reader until it became simply disgusting. There's no horror here, only a pallid drama and very few characters to establish human interest and root for.

0765325950|5.0|I have to be quick, because if I let myself talk too long about how much I love this book I'm sure to fill this review with spoilers. I've been waiting years for the end of this series, and the final volume did not disappoint. The forces of the Light make their stand against the darkness, and the action doesn't slow down for even a moment. This may very well be my favorite book in the series.
B00AWTSRZY|4.0|The 1st part was better, but this was still good! Amazed i got to watch well before Jan 29th supposed release date.
B0088O11NU|5.0|He really likes this one its very challenging for him. He likes that he can beat his dad on this game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Mis is what it was like back then; worry and uncertainty, poverty and problems, crime and punishment, innocence punished as well as the guilty
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I have to admit I was not that exited to watch this episode as I am a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes.  The only reason why I did decide to watch it was because I like the twist of having Lucy Liu playing Dr Watson.  The writers have done an outstanding job with a story line that follows, perfectly what a modern day Sherlock Holmes would be like living in NYC.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am really enjoying this game on my new tablet. It is easy to learn and fun to play. thanks!
B000002AGN|5.0|I had the wonderful experience of listening to Dave at HSU here in Arcata CA a few years ago.  I'm so glad I took in his performance.  This recording brings back vivid memories of that night.  I will miss him.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is good to have a trusty calculator at hand.  It is straight forward and easy to use.  Glad I took the time to add this to my Kindle.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Really enjoy this workout. A great alternative when I can't make it to the gym. Provides total body workouts, but can also target arms, legs, and, or cardio.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|Perfect fit and absolutely an essential accessory for the kindle. It makes transporting the Kindle easy and keeps it safe. It should have had a compartment for the charger.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Meryl Streep is her usual amazing self in this movie....she just becomes Julia. I absolutely loved this movie...it's just a fun feel-good movie that will make you definitely want to whip out one of Julia's recipes and cook away! In an age when too many movies are trash and you have to pay to hear the F-word constantly, this is just a fun way to spend some relaxing time with a cute story!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It is one of the most popular fun and great game, you will never ever ever ever get bored, it is awesome.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|James makes you fall in love with a man who can't be loved. From their first meeting till there cold goodbye the spark flows wild and strong between Ana and Grey. Its sexy literature at its best!
B00884GR0W|4.0|This app is great. It is NOT a knockoff of minecraft, contrary to popular belief.  It is a lot of fun, for there are tons of things to do. Only thing: controls are a bit wonky.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|It's a good book in that I read it straight through overnight. But there are some disconnects for me --<br /><br />** Spoiler alert here **<br /><br />- I didn't feel that Will loved Lou much more than Patrick did. Both men were selfishly focused on their own marathon-like goals, one mindlessly, the other tragically. I can't believe that any man truly in love with a girl would so resolutely and cruelly leave her without at least a little more conflict about it. It made her seem more like a speed bump--a six month diversion--than a grand love interest for Will.<br />- But still, no matter how hurt and angry she was, I can't understand how Lou could leave Will to face his fate alone. It seemed totally out of character for her given her loyalty and compassion.<br />- I also can't believe Lou took the money after he died. It seemed like blood money to me and rang false.<br /><br />A fascinating, emotional read, but one that left me thinking... I just don't get it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hard to put down! Excited for the second book! The book was definitely better than the movie and I would read it again
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Harry Bosch novels continue to get better, and better! Connelly gets better with each new phase in Harry's life! I especially like the fact that he has his daughter now!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the graphics and its fun and free!!! I recommend. this to anyone who likes to run and be adventurous
B004PAHZMC|3.0|Although a nice product it is very tiny so beware.  Not a lot of lego's will fit in this box.  It will help to organize by type if you plan to use it for that.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Works exactly like the camera's release button and uses same release mode setting. Prevents movement blur (when using a tripod) on slow exposures.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|90 minutes of stupid decisions and self destruction. They finally get together... next millisecond, huge tragedy, followed by 30 minutes of miserable flashbacks. If that's entertaining to you, this is your movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read. Awesome unexpected twist in the end. I will definitely be suggesting it to my friends. Another win for N.S.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This is a fab trilogy. Well worth reading. You should see the films too. I thoroughly recommend them all! Could hardly bear to put them down
B0016K40KY|5.0|I got this as a gift for my son.  I have maybe watched this movie once a year for decades.  Regardless of how you feel about TE Lawrence or the truth or not as told by the movie  -- it is just a great movie to watch and a story well told.  The cinematography and direction is superior.  Every new age of children should see: Lawrence of Arabia, El Cid, and Ben Hur
0385535147|5.0|Finally Grisham writes a compelling legal thriller.  Had me guessing most of the way. It would make a good movie!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|One of the best shows on television today. Great for the whole family; kids to grandparents, while still having a plot that will make you scratch your head, sit on the edge of your seat and mark the hours counting down til next week's episode! Great plot, great writing, great acting - just a fantastic show all around! Finally someone's gotten it right!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I really felt empathy for the main character and her situation.  I enjoyed this book so much that I immediately read the second book.  The mystery could have been better developed.  It felt a bit like an afterthought.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Great actors, but altogether way too much violence.  there was someone being executed avery few minutes it seemed.  I understand that's the story line, but there's no way I would have rented it if I'd known how absolutely sickening it was.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is tenacious when it comes to solving the crime, and in this book he proves once again that no matter how long it takes, he will tie loose ends together.
1451695195|5.0|The book left me me with more questions, but it was very inspiring and it gives you hope for the eventual end!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I haven't been using the battery for long, so I can't speak to it's life, but at least it's not so short that I already had to change it. So far, so good. The product arrived quickly and exactly as described.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Couldnt put this trilogy down and will defintely re-read it as i love the sci fi in the near future books!
030758836X|1.0|I didn't think I would like this book and I was right, but out of curiosity I just had to see what had this book on the best sellers list for so long.  I still don't get it.  Kept thinking it would get better, but not.
B003IZQI5U|5.0|There really isn't much that I can say about SGU becuase it is hard to discribe how great the show really is. All of the main cast really bring you into the story. They really need to continue with the show and do a few more seasons and end the show when the time comes properly. It has been a year and a half but if the full cast could come back and pick up from the second season that would make this viewer a really happy person.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works really well. able to insert in Kindle with ease. But I do wish it were longer. Sometimes too short for certain situations.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Moonrise Kingdom got great reviews and was favorably compared with \\"Fargo.\\"  Well, it's no \\"Fargo\\".  The scriptwriter seems to have borrowed the technique of stilted dialog and quirky characters from \\"Fargo\\" but someone forgot that the audience has to care about the characters.  The single biggest flaw  of this film is the casting of the male lead, Sam, played by Jared Gilman. Sadly, this kid has no charisma.  How he made it through the screen test is a complete mystery; they could have probably dragged some random kid out of any 5th grade class in America and gotten someone more appealing.  It's hard to \\"care\\" what happens to him. In fact, he's close to unlikeable.  And so, there is a hole at the heart of the movie, for which all the other excellent actors--who do a good job with their roles--just can't compensate.  The second biggest flaw is the casting of his supposedly pre-teen love interest, who seems to have some sort of never-explained mood disorder. Once again, a little back-story might have helped, as would the casting of someone who looks and acts closer to age 11/12 than 17.  I might also say that whoever wrote the dialog for these kids apparently hasn't talked to a preadolescent in a looooong time.  Here's a clue:  kids don't talk like Wikipedia and if they do, it turns everyone else off.  There is a sort of semi-sex scene with these two kids late in the movie which as a pediatrician and child psychiatrist made my skin crawl.  It was unnecessary and gratuitous and frankly creepy.  As I write this, I am still baffled by the rave reviews.  I have to stretch to give it even 2 stars.
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|What a lovely surprise find - Fantastic! I thought I knew all the vest music that came out this last year; but glad to discover this one.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|the game isn't what i expected, but it's fun to play.  I'm glad I got it for free and did not pay.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a very very good family movie.  Very entertaining.  Great story line.  The music was also good.  Great purchase.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We watched season one, season two (late night marathans) ... we had to purchase the 1st episode of season three because we missed it on TV ..... You will not be disappointed ... lots of characters but each one is so real ... when I look at the picture, I could comment on each one of those actors ...
0307948110|4.0|A physics genius called Alex Hoffmann working at CERN in Switzerland creates a programme which is like an artificial brain that works faster than human brains and learns to get better at what it does - namely, make money on the stock exchange. Years later and in its fourth incarnation, VIXAL, as it's called, is a programme that has made Hoffmann one of the top scientists of his day and a billionaire. But things start to go wrong and over the span of 24 hours he will see the extent of the monster he has created and what he must do to stop it... before it destroys the world!<br /><br />Robert Harris adapts the story of Victor Frankenstein to the 21st century, riffing on the recent financial troubles, and creating a kind of HAL-like villain. The whole book covers 24 hours but Harris manages to convey much longer periods of time in that space, constructing backgrounds to the various characters effortlessly, all while keeping the action ticking over at a brisk pace.<br /><br />The Frankenstein theme is subtly hinted at throughout: the setting of Geneva, a quote from Mary Shelley, the Hotel Diodati, Dr Polidori (female, Hoffmann's shrink) but the bigger homage is that of creator and monster, Hoffmann and VIXAL-4. The full extent of his creation isn't revealed until the end and an even stranger story than the one imparted here is hinted at by the end.<br /><br />I thought that despite it being a thriller and geared toward quick reading, it was still written well and all of the characters and the inscrutable world of finance were conveyed clearly and effortlessly by Harris. The story goes in unexpected directions and I even found myself liking some of the more reptilian characters (the smug Englishman Quarry was brilliant). I don't think people appreciate how difficult this task is and the fact that Harris did such a good job of it is understated in the majority of these reviews.<br /><br />A well written thriller with an excellent story, handled perfectly by a master novelist at the top of his game - I recommend anyone looking for a good read to turn to \\"The Fear Index\\" for a diverting few hours of entertainment.ist at the top of his game - I recommend anyone looking for a good read to turn to \\"The Fear Index\\" for a diverting few hours of entertainment.
B008KWHM6U|5.0|This album is easily one of my favorites from the past few years.  I went to their concert and they were AMAZING live, i recommend getting the extended version which includes a live track CD as well.  Overall, this CD is catchy, wholesome, and pure genius.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Session 9 was a very creepy movie.  I guess you can call it a psychological thriller.  A very good purchase.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|Just from a sound quality point of view this set is excellent and bests the Ashkenazy CDs and Anda LPs, the only other two sets I have to compare this to. Musically, I would rank this one over the Ashkenazy easily and a little bit above the Anda. The fortepiano sound great with a sharp attack. A great set and my favorite of the three I have heard but I have yet to hear the Uchida CDs or Perahia!
B00005JNQA|5.0|For the era that it was made, it's a nice and clean Friday night classic to add to your collection.
B007MDB71O|4.0|It was supposed to be new however the Blu Ray showed that it had been previously viewed. That being said the movie showed no ill effects & the picture was fantastic!
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Philip Kerr is brilliant in his depiction of Germany in the grip of an grotesque ideology. His presentation of Bernie as a sympathetic character not withstanding some of the things he is forced to do gives his readers an insight into how invasive and controlling a military dictatorship can be.<br /><br />Although Kerr is only in his fifties he has done prodigious research into a time that he never lived through. I recommend this and others in this series to anyone
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got this app on my Kindle Fire second generation (not HD).<br /><br />Facebook made this app. Awesome: something official. It's NOT just the mobile app like the Facebook that came with the original first generation Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I have no problems seeing as many entries on my news feed as I like. They must have fixed that problem.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked Scope before, but this is way better. You can do all kinds of stuff. If you see a group of pictures, you can swipe through them quickly.<br /><br />Anyway, try it out. It's free.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|What a wonderful game! I`m enjoying it very much. The graphics are bright and adorable. I play several of these Dragon creator games and I must say this is truly the best so far. It is easy to learn and fun to play. I love that there is no energy bar, you can just sit and play as long as you want. I find it quite relaxing. To cross breed dragons to I really like the creativity of that. This is well worth the download.
B00001ZULV|4.0|This CD needed more post-gabriel era Genesis songs that we all know and love. Recommend this CD to any Genesis fan.<br /><br />(Not part of the review but general wish)I wish there was a BIG Phil Collins compilation that had his best songs from Genesis and his solo career. Even if it was a 2 or 3 cd set i'd buy it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This classic is so well written that one has no problem imagining the action and setting. My only disappointment was that there was audio on only a small portion.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book is sooo good better then the movie.  I cant wait to read the rest of the books she has written.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I shouldn't even have to explain why this got 5 stars. This may be a guilty pleasure for some, but for those who are skeptical about buying--don't be!
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of his best. Just what you'd expect: non-stop action and great characters. Even the bad guys are perfect! Can't wait for his next book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Pleased with the story and how it developed through the book.<br />It was more than what I expected after reading some of the other reviews.  It is a solid second!
B001HC8516|5.0|The first time, I had a highlighter and took notes, and then lent it to everyone I knew. Which of course, means I lost it and had to buy it again. I finally have a nice man, but I'm glad I read this book, because I was falling for some of these behaviors! I'm a successful woman in a man's profession. I have a master's degree and am completely self-sufficient, but for some reason, it took this book to get me to realize I DESERVE someone great. The real lesson was what behaviors are unacceptable vs. &#34;pick-your-battle.&#34;
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|A little slow getting started, but I thought this was an interesting look into the sociopathic mind as a child. Even though the book is fiction and not based on actual fact or medical research, it still gets you thinking.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter liked this book so much she read it in 1 day.She could not put it down when she got it
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|good movie great message for young people. Watched on Kindle Fire and images were very good. Would  recommend this movie to anyone.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual Tom Clancy has constructed a fantastic novel in the Jack Ryan series. This book contains all of the characters we have grown to love and ensures a continuation of the Ryan saga.<br />I have read every book of the Jack Ryan series, both when they were published and in chronological order beginning with \\"Without Remorse\\" and I can't wait for the next one.
1400049628|4.0|This was a good book. I thought that this book was way better than \\"World War Z\\". This book is written as a survival as if the zombie apocalypse has already happened numerous times in human history and gives great advice on how to prepare/survive the next outbreak.<br /><br />I was actually reading this book in a restaraunt awaiting my food to be brought to me when the waiter noticed the title of the book and started to freak out. I'm sure he was just playing along (I think) but I literally had to explain the concept of the book to him. So, if that was the authors intention when this book was written, he succeeded in scaring someone.<br /><br />I especially liked the end of the book which depicts a short history of various zombie outbreaks throughout human history.<br /><br />Again, I liked this book a lot. A good read.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Great Series, great season, who dont like to see a good adventure of the doctor and the ponds (and river song)
B005H0IW6W|5.0|How can you possibly go wrong with Michael Buble ... this is a beautiful Christmas CD ... partners exceptionally well with Lady Antebellum and Scotty McCreery!
B00000K3UU|4.0|This dvd is both very funny and very smart.  I ordered it at a great price and got it fast.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This was very awkward but very good  I liked the words in the book but I also liked the ending
B0011WL8MK|5.0|I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ONE BUT I GAVE IT AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND THE MAN SAID IT WAS GREAT.  CAME EARLIER THAN EXPECTED, JUST BEFORE XMAS.  HE'S BEEN L0OOKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT.  OF COURSE JACK BENNEY IS ALWAYS FUNNY.  I THANK YOU AMAZON.  I'M TRUELY GLAD I FOUND YOU!
B009OXS8RQ|1.0|Lana Del Rey's Paradise is a 5 star effort, the quality of the vinyl pressing is not. Amazon shipped the 'brand new' vinyl release, it was SCRATCHED, DIRTY and the cardboard sleeve was BENT. Very dissatisfied, the record skips and pops periodically. VERY CHEAP PRESSING.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I didn't think this looked funny.  I was wrong.  It is funny every single time I watch it.  If you like comedy you should like this.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|'Bout time Rod Stewart recorded a Christmas CD.  If you're a fan of his you'll like it.  Ordered several as Christmas gifts.  What I didn't like was the price increase with the demand.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|GREAT TO SEE HUGH LAURIE AS A GOOFBALL.  I LOVED HOUSE BUT HIM AS A YOUNG RICH PLAYBOY IS JUST TOO MUCH.  STEPHEN FRYE IS ABSOLUTELY THE TOPS AS HIS KNOW IT ALL BUTLER.  ( FOR OTHERS WHO WATCH BONES FRYE IS THE PSYCHIATRIST THAT HAD BONES BUILD HIS BARBECUE DURING THE SHOOTING CLOWN INCIDENT).<br />GOOD CLEAN FUN SET IN THE EARLY TWENTIES OR THIRTIES.
B00116FT6M|2.0|Way to serious was not funny like the live musical, travlota playing the mothers role stright just strange, singing was good
B003L77GG0|4.0|Being in the hospital for years I got into this series.  I had to get these to see how it all ended.  It ended very cool.  These dvds were in terrific shape and I have watched them several times.  Anyone who likes superhero stuff would like this.
B008M36EEI|5.0|My wife and I finally found the time to watch this and we were not dissappointed. Perfect casting and unusual subject matter made for a delightful viewing experience.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Super accessible, with loads of informations, but Ferris provides guidance as to the &#34;levels&#34; of information you want or need and shows where it's ok to skip certain sections and what sections are more foundational to learning.
B009IEXKXI|1.0|Story dragged on forever and actually was rather boring.  Actually stopped reading it 3/4 into the book and went on to read something with some depth.
B0013FFMOK|4.0|This is an interesting story that Will Smith is in.  It will keep you guessing and Will does act very good in it.
B0073UQHUC|1.0|Textbook used for a class I took.  Not my cup of tea; will resell ASAP as this is not my normal purchase.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Bujold's stories in this universe and with these characters are always excellent.  In this case I didn't like the ending, a matter of personal preference in the knowledge that this was a story created by an author, not biographical.  It is probably a tribute to the author that almost all her work seems to be true stories, however fantastic some of them are.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game, easy to play, hard to put down once I start.  Think it would be great for any age.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I liked the tv show and this was pretty good.  Pretty far fetched but still good.  If you liked the tv show you would get a kick out of this movie.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|If you liked Twilight, you will also like this show!  Although, there are many vampire series on today, this is the only one that I have found to have staying power.
B001POX73C|4.0|I just finished this book.  The story was very entertaining.  Never got boring.  It didn't have any real romance, which I like.  Nothing that kept you in suspense or left you dangling for more.  No male/female interaction that made you feel excited for the characters.  But I always look for clean books.  I cant stand books that take you into the bedroom.  I prefer books written by Jane Austin or the Bronte sisters just to give you my type of taste.  So for a story it was enjoyable and I would recommend it as an easy read that shouldn't bore you.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|This is a great old movie that I have seen many times and still enjoy it.  Jody Foster was great is in this role.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I grew up with G.I, Joes.  I was excited about this movie.  It was very entertaining for a G.I. Joe fan.  Can't wait for #2 this summer.  Lots of surprises and turns you won't see coming.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  The dialog/actions of the characters is repetative and quickly boring, never matching the social and educational background portrayed.  There is a hint of romance, which keeps you hoping.  The sex is not what the media makes it out to be.  I won't read/recommend the next installment as I expect more from my authors.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|The stickers are reusable and we haven't found a problem with that yet.  They are not initially easily removed so I must participate with her.  But it's fun to do together.  The only issue I guess I have is that there is a lot more clothes than dolls and some dolls have arms up, some down, some up and down which means certain clothes wont look right.  Cant put a dress with arms up on a doll with arms down and since she is a toddler she doesn't recognize that.  Not a big deal.  I still would recommend unless your looking for something your young child can do alone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|From page 1 I could not wait to read the next story within the story! Riveting, uniquely imaginative and full to the brim. A fantastic read!
B00061QK02|3.0|Everyone told me how great this was.  It was in my opinion good, but not great for Will Ferrell.  They are making #2 now because so many people love this movie.  I don't dislike it I'm just a little disappointed in Will.  I seem the only one though.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It is so interesting to see how people abused alcohol/smoking during this time and it was normal social behaviors.  And the sex!  It is simply amazing that AIDS wasn't prevalent then!  Still, you cannot help but be sucked into the manners and dress that have totally disappeared from today's society.
1423124960|5.0|My two gbabs couldn't be more different one loves princesses the other cowgirls.  My princess bab loves this book.  She can't get enough.  Excellent picture quality and detail. Easy read.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Who wouldn't like this movie? I saw it in theaters several times and glad that I am now able to finish off my the current Marvel Collection.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|All my friends really liked this movie.  It was funny.  A bit too crazy for me, but others love it.  It is well worth owning.
3832756302|5.0|I use this calendar as a diary. Normally I order the antique book cover, but this year, I was intrigued by the open door Magritte design.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love the different sounds you can wake up too. Double check the alarm when you schedule it for a week, it may not ring
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Very unhappy and want my .99 back! yes it is only .99 but takes up waisted space, since it DOES NOT WORK! don't but it!!!!!!!!!
0790729601|4.0|This is a good Arnold movie.  With his humor and wild story ideas.  Lots of cool stunts and action.  If you're an Arnold fan you'll like this movie.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Are these guys related? Their style is unique and young.  Several of the songs on this CD are played on the country station here.
B001C08RHA|5.0|very exciting, need to have watched the previous super heros movies to know or remember who some of the other charactors are.
B00870Z05U|1.0|I was very disappointed with the music... guess I couldn't get past the Phantom of the Opera to be fair.  I still haven't watched all of the video.  Just can't hang in there!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This dvd is the first of many funny movies in the series.  Great idea.  I love this dvd.  I'm glad I ordered it.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Again, this was needed to complete this collection. I am happy to say it was as great as the others.
B005F82X48|5.0|Awesome sound and catchy lyrics. The softer songs, like &#34;The Grey&#34; and &#34;Only a Memory,&#34; a lot of people could really connect to. As well as &#34;Get Well,&#34; and &#34;Iodine,&#34; although I personally don't know the feelings expressed in those songs, can speak out to other who I know do very poignantly. A new favourite band and album, hands down!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|C.Nolan brings us the last chapter of Batman by bringing him face to face with Bane. At his side (at lest occasionally) we are seeing the mysterious and feline femme fatal known as Selina Kyle.
B00003CXGG|5.0|One of Jet Lis first US movies.  It is him showing what he's got.  You will get a kick out of this and some laughs.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Bought this as a recommendation. Have not watched yet, but know it will be good. Look forward to another movie Saturday!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I bought this so I could perserve images before the negatives aged too much.  Easy and quick to set up and start scanning.  The light turned to red after about an hour. Don't use it for too long at a time.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|THis is a good DVD about family and values.  I look forward in viewing this with  my family.  Thank you.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Every time you see this movie you will notice things you never noticed before.  And you'll be impressed with Tom Hanks.  It mixes a great story with historical facts.  You will like this movie and watch it many times.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|After having a pre-Christmas conversation with my sister, The Diary Series was agreed upon as being a collectors item.  I was not dis-satisfied!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My grandchildren love this app. There is so many activities to keep them busy.  They are quite creative  They spend a lot of time on their creations.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Un believable that she managed to write a trilogy and keep book #3 as appealing as book #1 ! I couldn't put the book down from the moment I started up to the very end.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Most people might not think Justin Timerlake and Mila Kunis could be great together but they are.  It's a very funny movie about a real life thing that many people try.  I was surprised how funny this was.  You will be too.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Wonderful read...highly recommend, esp. for anyone who has had to endure the ups and downs of cancer treatment. Puts the complexities and challenges of treating cancer in its complex context.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is a sad story about dysfunctional families and the impact of the parents' unhappinesses on the lives and self esteem and relationships of their children. It is obvious that J:K; Rowling loves adolescents and after having written for and about the privileged  and those who can escape into a world of phantasy she turns her attention (and ours) to those who cannot escape. Every problem of contemporary society is touched on: poverty, racism, sexism, self-mutilation, prostitution, drug addiction, delinquency, suicide, obsession with technology You come to care deeply about the characters, even the sick self-centered ones and one desperately to help/
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An impressive first novel from a truly inventive writer. What scene-setting he accomplishes on such a limited stage!  I'm waiting for his second effort!
6305508550|4.0|This dvd has so many funny stars in it.  It's funny from the first scene to the end.  I suggest it to all my friends and family who hasn't seen it yet.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|It was ok to watch. and now I warite the more words that this requires me to write because I am awesome.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Great acting and good remake of the original movie with Maureen O'Hara & Natalie Wood. Richard Attenborough is a very believable &#34;St. Nicholas&#34; who captures the hearts of all who view this classic movie.
B008NABUU8|5.0|I generally don't have time or patience for most APP games.  This is a puzzle and fun with Construction geometry.  Having 3 years experience being a PM over Timber Bridge construction in my resume, this is quite enjoyable,
6304981635|5.0|This being Bruce Lee's last movie ever makes it awesome to have.  It is great Bruce Lee action.  This is a piece of history.  Any martial arts fan would love this.
B00AECGQF2|2.0|My granddaughter wanted this, so I got it for her one evening, thinking it would be cute and fun. The graphics are just ugly. Faces are not appealing to kids - and who else would be playing this type of game?
0307277887|4.0|I chose this rating because the book came in good condition as promised. As well as on time, which was a major relief for me because I need it for my Serial killers class I'm taking. It's a justice studies class..
0062101897|5.0|This is a beautifully printed and bound treasure of Harry Potter memorabilia. It takes you on a journey all the way through the entire Harry Potter film series, from initial ideas through the execution of the filming. Wonderful pictures of the entire journey. I highly recommend this volume!!
B000060K4O|5.0|This is still a very funny and original movie.  You can watch it over and over and still laugh.  This is a classic.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I like it because of the action scenes. I think it would be better with a named star. Watch it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large display and ease of use. This is the perfect (simple) calculator app for me. Highly recommend.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This was a really good book, I did find myself wondering what would happen when I was away from reading.  Con was that there were parts when it dragged on and I skipped paragraphs.. but then again that is just me.. overall it was good
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|In the future instead of UFC we fight robots.  This is a Rocky type movie involving robots.  Hugh Jackman is awesome in it.  There are a couple stories in one.  Like Rocky movies.  If you're a fan of the Rocky series you will probably like this movie.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Minecraft ripoff, but decided to give it a shot since it was free. Started it up, created a new game, saw the gangnam style loading screen, hit home, and IMMEDIATLEY UNINSTALLED IT.<br /><br />It goes to show that they are only in it for the quick buck by riding the coattails of Mojang and Psy (whose 15 minutes was up 20 minutes ago).
B004QX07G4|1.0|I love the Ellen TV Show but the book was mostly things I had already heard on the show. I lost interest about midway and never finished reading the book. I am still an Ellen fan though.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Watched these guys on tv and my wife fell in love with almost every song they played.  Really like the energy!
B0095VP8D4|1.0|I bought this about a month ago. I was building my own pc. But all the components I bought worked great exept this. failed to boot after a month....
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Just what I had hoped it would be, extremely helpful and informative. Could not have hoped for anything better. Simply amazing.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It has some very funny parts, very original. But the story is quite boring, too simple, even for an evening with friends.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Bought this for my sister since she was always borrowing my copy. Arrived a little early, was sealed like a new movie and as far as I know she has no complaints! My sister was very happy this Christmas!
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|Great movie about what happens in business and finance world. Strong cast does a good job of portraying some of the ruthlessness in real life.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The beginning  of married lives, the rather amazingly fast potentials for the (new) acquisitions and loss of fortunes. Love this series- characters, costumes - excellent!  Two slight disappointments: I feel that Violet meeting her match in Martha Levinson (Mary's American mother), casts her a bit out of character- it's not like her to not have the last word! I'm guessing her philosophy has transitioned to&#34;  better to hold the tongue (depriving others of some wonderfully sarcastic wit) than erring on the side of American vulgarity. Mary's sweet countenance is beginning to wear a little thin- hope to see a little more develop from her.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|Set in India, this movie has a heart warming story, gentle humor and an outstanding cast but India steals the show!
B000ASATYO|5.0|This is a funny and endearing movie with Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors, as a guy who not only 'sees dead people' but employs them in his not-quite legal business!  You'll love the characters and they truly are 'characters' in the best senses of the word.  This was a gift for my adult daughter who wanted it for her collection of favorite movies to view again and again.
0307341550|4.0|Two tons of dysfunction in an 8-ounce package (softcover).<br /><br />I can't say that I've ever read anything by Stephen King that made me feel even uncomfortable - let alone frightened. But there are darker, grimmer imaginations out there. And Gillian Flynn is one of them (don't be fooled by her smiley soccer mom appearance). Not only dark, and grim, but primeval: lifting the stone to remind of the creatures that we know about ... but are not eager to talk about.<br /><br />This is Flynn's first book - re-released now that she's more famous. Probably not a great travel book. And not a great book of any kind for someone easily susceptible to nightmares. But, if you take Despair \\"straight up\\", it's an intriguing story.
B00000JL86|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my daughter and granddaughter. I was very pleased with the price and delivery. They were happy with the quality.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about and i wanted this show and i got hood
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My daughter installed this app on her Kindle and loves it. Only problem is she has it really loud and lets it go on for about 5 min.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|I have read a few Michael Connelly books, I really enjoyed this one. Was hard to put down and unpredictable..
034580404X|5.0|I started reading and couldn't stop until I finished all three books, then I loaned them to my friend and she was consumed, then I bought them for my daughter for her  40 something birthday..looking forward to more from this author.
B0037AGASG|5.0|My grandson loved this, I listened too ------- really good!! Now I know why all the kids love Justin Bieber !!
B005EP1PJQ|3.0|My Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: Okay so I had heard so many fabulous things about this book. My friends who don't even really like this genre were raving over it. I know so many people who said this book was their favorite book of the year and I guess I bought into the hype.<br /><br />That's what makes this book so hard to review. I really liked it, but I was expecting to love it. So since my expectations were so high, I was disappointed. However, I think if I had come in with low expectations then I would have liked it more. However, either way I would have given it a solid 3 for reasons I'll discuss later.<br /><br />However, I feel like my review is a fair depiction of this novel. Anna is ticked that her romantic-sop of a father is making her spend a year in Paris, her senior year in Paris. She's leaving behind her best friend and Toph, the boy she's been crushing on for forever. He was just finally starting to act like he liked her.<br /><br />But once in Paris, Anna quickly becomes friends with a girl named Mer and a boy named Etienne St. Clair. There's no denying that St. Clair is hot, but there's also denying that he has a girlfriend and that Mer is also in love with him.<br /><br />But as their friendship grows and deepens, Anna becomes less and less able to deny her feelings for him. Besides she's supposed to like Toph.<br /><br />Anna was obsessed with film. She wants to be a film critic and so when she learns Paris is also the city of cinema she goes to film after film. I loved that part of her personality. Anna was a character who I actually really liked. She wasn't perfect, but she also wasn't whiny and annoying.<br /><br />Then there was St. Clair. I know that several people were frustrated with him for the entire novel, I won't lie and claim otherwise. However, I really liked him. I could see where he was coming from and he just seemed like a great guy.<br /><br />Perkins' writing was compelling and I was drawn into the story rather quickly. Not to mention, I loved the characters. So why only 3 stars?<br /><br />I love it when chick lit novels delve into deeper issues and have more profoundness to them. Perkins had deeper issues both Anna and St. Clair had issues with their parents, but that wasn't as developed as I would have liked it to be.<br /><br />Basically, this book was enjoyable, but I've read a lot of enjoyable books. This one just lacked that extra something to make it memorable enough to be a 4. It was cute, fun, enjoyable, and light-hearted. If you love YA realistic contemporary romance, then this one will be an enjoyable read.<br /><br />In Summary: Perkins' debut novel is excellent. Her characters are quirky, lovable, and entertaining. Her writing is beautiful. Her plot is intriguing. All in all, it's an enjoyable read, but in my book it lacked that extra something to knock it over the top.<br /><br />Warnings/Side-notes: Mild language and minor sexual references. Really though this is mild YA, that I wouldn't have a problem recommending to younger teenage kids.<br /><br />The Wrap-up:<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Danica Pagen into the story rather quickly.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|I always prefer the happy ever after in books.  This was entertaining and funny.  I wanted them to work out.  They were a terrific duo.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|As a highly portable item, this product offers class leading convenience paired with moderate sharpening performance.  If you are looking for a tool you can take with you (particularly in the field) and use easily and quickly on a dull knife to achieve basic sharpness, this may be a good option for you.  I can slice paper and remove arm hair with a folding or kitchen knife after using this sharpener, but the results are nothing special.  If sharpness is your primary goal, I would consider other options.<br /><br />Compared to the Accusharp and Spyderco Sharpmaker, the PP1 sharpens the least effectively.  The Accusharp is not as portable, but sharpens most knives I've tried better than the PP1.  I am admittedly surprised by this since the Accusharp only uses carbide blades, nevertheless I would give it a slight edge.  The Spyderco Sharpmaker to my mind is a significantly better tool than either the PP1 or Accusharp, and if you can spend the extra money I think it is a worthwhile upgrade.  It will get your knives a good deal sharper, and it offers you more flexibility of use.<br /><br />Depending on your expectations and application, the PP1 may still be a good option.  If you are seeking something to sharpen your knives, and you do not plan on sharpening them on the go or in the field, I would suggest getting another product.
B002T921AC|5.0|This Grandma knew her grandson loved Justin Bieber, soooooooo this seemed like a good idea for a Christmas present. It was!! I sneaked a listen too, as I hadn't really been paying attention to the young singer. Not bad, Justin has a really nice voice. Now I can see why all the &#34;fuss&#34;. I think I'm a fan now too :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds is a good way to relax.  I like to play this on down time or before falling asleep.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|By all rights, this movie should have been terrible.  Despite havign a fair amount of talent in it, the premise was only moderately interesting and it very easily could have crossed the line into teen angst melodrama.<br />That being said, it was brilliant.  The writing was fantastic, the comedic timing was perfect and the takes were awesome.  Couple that with a wide range of musical genres and styles and you get a touching, hysterical story.  I recommend this to anyone.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|I read this at the recommendation of several friends. It was an interesting concept, but it struck me as mostly predictable, and childish or immature. These attributes may not bother most readers, but it really took me out of the story. Possible spoiler alert here: The war is a little too comic bookish for me. This fake \\"good vs evil/old vs new\\" scenario is very played out, even with the man behind the curtain element. Again, it was predictable and that took away from the novelty of the fantasy elements.
1250008409|5.0|Excellent book . Andy makes meditation easy and fun ! I loved his stories and great facts too . Highly motivated by this book to join the practice!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought the entire series was easy and enjoyable to read.  It helps put things in perspective and makes you appreciate what you have.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I can watch my favorite episodes over and over. With most of television a great wasteland, it is really a comfort to have seasons of good shows to watch.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Five star!! Never saw what was coming. It was very enjoyable, I would highly recommend it for all to read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game a lot it is fun and yes if you don't know were to look u do have to shut down your fun or whatever.But if you go to stuff then options and click on that you will see the exit sign.Otherwise, fun!
B000AP04EW|5.0|Best movie for couples. Great story, lots of action, very funny and a love story. What else do you ask for?
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Television shows are fast becoming junk. Bones and Castle are about the only ones I watch, and they are so good I watch them over and over now.
B00942Y94I|5.0|I have read all of the books that are in this saga. I am usually sorely disappointed with the movie makers interpretation of books. However, I have to say that they did a fairly good job with this one. I only wish that Amazon would have had this movie available to rent; rather than having to pay full purchase price.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game a lot it is fun and yes if you don't know were to look u do have to shut down your fun or whatever.But if you go to stuff then options and click on that you will see the exit sign.Otherwise, fun!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I really like Mark Wahlberg, but I gotta say I was a little disappointed in this movie. If it had been cleaned up it would have made a wonderful childrens movie.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I had been a rip-snorting, blood-spitting Who fan from the time I first heard Tommy, when I was 10 years old. I became a crazed groupie, following them around on every tour on the West Coast. Years passed and I became separated from the band spiritually, forsaking them to some extent in favor of the Beatles. The music no longer held the same sway for me, or so I thought, as an adult, now in my 50's.<br /><br />That has completely changed with the reading of this book. It is a revelation, both in the brilliant wit of Pete's writing and in the exposure, vividly recollected, of some of the darker episodes in his life. I was astounded by much of it. Even as a serious Who aficionado, knowing and reading all there was to read especially about Pete, I was mesmerized by the details of his early life, and it is pure pleasure to have him clearly elucidate the exact elements that went into, for example, composing Tommy. How the plot elements came to be. Fascinating. I would not have really considered Pete the inventor of the power chord, until he points it out. It's true, really. Bleeding brilliant.<br /><br />Reading this has turned me back into the Who fan I had been as a teenager. I have cranked up Quadrophenia, Who's Next, Who By Numbers (still an awesome album), and had that thrill I felt as a youth as each song I've known forever fires up. I look up at my signed album cover for Quadrophenia, mounted on my wall, and it all comes back to me. This book will inspire those only passingly familiar with the Who's oeuvre to look further. And I suspect it will rekindle the joy of the longtime fan who may have drifted away.<br /><br />Bravo Pete!
0545265355|5.0|These books came in their own box set, pristine condition, can't wait to start reading them and compare it to the movie.
B002M9WW30|5.0|great stuff, all the rocky in one collection gotta love it. This blu Ray edition is one of the best collection for Rocky fans
B004P4KMSC|5.0|This truck is an excellent toy. It is well made and tough. I would purchase a product from Bruder again.
B000F8O35U|1.0|Was looking forward to watching The Little Mermaid with my 2 1/2 year old daughter and the disk we received was bent and wouldn't play. The package was not damaged so you can tell that the disk was not damage in shipping. Where are peoples integrity now a days. If you are going to sell something then make sure at least you are selling a usable product.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is probably the best harlequin book I've read in a long while. The main characters felt real to me, and the author managed to create conflict without either of them coming across as crazy, abusive or too stupid to live! I was able to like them both, even when they were messing up.<br /><br />It is also well edited. I didn't notice any of the continuity errors or spelling problems that I've become used to, pulling me out of the story, so either there really aren't any or the story is so good I didn't even notice!<br /><br />I'm giving this 5 stars because there really wasn't anything I didn't like about this book. I found myself just smiling to myself as I read. Overall it was just a highly enjoyable reading experience.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The universe needs to be a little larger. Needs to incorporate more options, like the xbox version has. Otherwise, nice to get toplay on the go.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book held my interest  from page one. Grisham at his best. Read it. You won't be disappointed I couldn't put it down.
B00A0X947M|5.0|Evferything Elvis<br /><br />Everything of Elvis is a 5star rating. Don't do much music other than Elvis and country. So rock on King of rock and roll
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This is just the most beautiful boxset, so nice in fact that when my mum saw it she wanted one also, so I had to buy a second one.<br />It has all 4 seasons of the OC presented in 16:9.<br />Great book type boxset with thick cardboard pages where the discs are stored.<br />Between each season is a group of thin pages with photos from the season and a list of episodes.<br />The only issue is it is quite long so won't sit nicely in a shelf, but I have it facing forward on display so it doesn't really matter.<br />The cover is actually a hologram type so looks like the water is moving,<br />Must have for any OC fan.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This movie was great start to finish.  The actions was just wonderful especially knowing that he did most of all his own stunts.  WOW!!  I must see.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't expect this at all its so great!! And parts were boring but it was very few(: great book please read
B000001GBJ|5.0|After a long day at work.  The first thing when I get home is playing this CD. It makes me feel pure and peaceful.  Especially #9.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|My 9 year old son wanted the entire collection of the &#34;old&#34; Batman movies (Ha!) after becoming a fan of the new Christian Bale Batman movies! After spending a year with garage sale VHS movies and constant visits to the public library so he could watch ALL of them - he woke up Christmas morning and was pleasantly surprised to get this boxed set! As soon as our public library re-opened my son donated his garage sale VHS tapes to the library so they would have a complete set to loan out! The cost was pleasing to our pocket book and the delivery was super fast! We've watched the entire set atleast 4 times since Christmas day and our enjoying it as a family! Thanks for making our Christmas shopping ALOT easier!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Of course my opinion, but you can't beat Michael Keaton as BeetleJuice.  Very funny, and full of Tim Burton's style.
B0031RS44S|4.0|A book that makes you want to keep reading. A must for all fans with a nice twist. Go and read it.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This album captures the raw energy and emotion of Muddy.  Buddy Guy is on acoustic behind him tearing it up.  I DJ a little on college radio and this album is in the rotation. If you are a blues fan, this is a must own!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|brilliant book. such unexpected events and outcomes. characters are so relatable. Recommend this book to all of my friends. no doubt about it. buy it now !!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I can't think of a better way to sort out your life than time on the trail. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes to get out in the great outdoors. The book has so much to offer with the well worded experience of life's set backs the author has and the way everything makes sense to her after some soul searching while on the trail. Bravo! Write some more...Please
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Classic Reacher shooting and cutting his way through difficult situations. A great book a must for all Jack Reacher Fans
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a great version of Angry Birds!  It plays well and has no hang ups or issues that we have noticed during gameplay.  I only have one problem: everyone else is using it and I can't get to my phone!  LOL
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Bold and sassy, completely irreverent, but extremely  gripping.  As they say, you won't be able to put it down.  Very unpredictable.
B00008977N|5.0|This is a great video. The videography is good and the content is just as I expected. It's Peter Gabriel!
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|very good details not only on cards and bourd but on game pieces, it included chef and the new characters, and i like how kenny's house is cheapest property and was on one dollar bill and Token is on 500 in conclusin it is very good
B0063GORYU|4.0|Got this by mistake and then got the one I really wanted so I haven't played with this.  But I might try it for a change from the other Spider.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The best book ever written. Although there.are several grammar mistakes it is still a a a as a a a a good biok
B0084I9QFU|5.0|I love any music from Michael Jackson. I especially ejoyed the remakes of his classics. Lots of talen went into the remakes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't really relate to the main character in this book but I pushed forward anyway....and boy am I glad I did! Wow....this book is really good. Expect a wet face though cause it definitely pulls on your heart strings! It's mysterious, sad, and satisfying...at the end! Not my favorite but really good!! First time reading Colleen Hoover and I will definitely be buying more!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|The ending was not as great as the story getting there. The story picked up quickly and was a page turner until the ending.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book is a gem!<br />Some of my family had seen the puppet production of War Horse in London and I wanted to share in that highly acclaimed show! I was not disappointed!<br />I have seen the movie, which though good, the written word is so much more satisfying!<br />I highly recommend this could-be-true story!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|The Grey was action-packed but a little slow moving. I like Liam Neeson as an actor- very talented. His part helped maintain my interest  which might have waned had any lesser known person had the part. Lots of blood in this movie- a tad gory, but I liked it!!
0743490304|3.0|Started well, but faded quickly. Gets more and more unbelievable towards the end.  Quick read and overall pretty interesting despite its flaws.  Just average.
1451695195|2.0|I read Dr Alexander's eagerly after having read the report of him in Newsweek. He is well qualified to write of his experience being an eminent neurosurgeon well known in medical world. Also he does a convincing job of describing his near-death-experience in the light of &#34;a medical profession that refuses to believe it's possible.&#34; pg 135.<br /><br />But  I was disappointed that he never mentions seeing Jesus during his out-of- the- body experience. He had a meaningful tale, but it does not follow the description given in the Bible, e.g. &#34;Look! He comes with the clouds of heaven. And everyone will see him...&#34;Revelation 1:2 NLT.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|It's pretty good, had to read it for school and was surprised how much better it is then some of the other stuff we have to read.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It is yet another physics-based tablet game, but so much more. World of Goo's innovative interface takes some getting used to, but it is well-suited to the gameplay and very well implemented. The landscapes are fantastic. The many different types of goo ball characters are cute and oddly interesting. The sound effects are perfect. The background music is surreal and moody, and beautifully well composed.  Humorous bits abound throughout various parts of the game, from the loading screen graphics, names of levels, general level design, and the frequent interactions with messages left behind by &#34;the Sign Painter.&#34;  My only criticism is that a 4.3&#34; tablet screen is kind of small for playing this game with adult fingers.  My whole family loves this game.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say, this is only the second erotic book that I have ever read and I really enjoyed it!  I enjoyed the story for the most part, the dialogue, and the way Ana's character reads. When I read what she was saying, I truly felt that it was a young adult telling the story (young adult as in 20-24 years old).<br /><br />As other readers have mentioned in their reviews, there were a few annoying things about it.  First, I found it very hard to believe that Ana didn't have an e-mail address or computer as a senior in college that was about to graduate.  I don't think I could have gotten through college without either of the two and I graduated from college in 2008!  Second, and the biggest annoyance to me, was the repetition. Rolling her eyes, peeking, biting her lip, frown, murmur, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. ;) Third, though I really enjoyed the book, it did lack a plot.  I didn't even realize that it lacked a plot until I was reading the reviews and someone mentioned it.  It truly does not have a plot, but I still liked the book and I'm looking forward to reading the second.  It was HOT and I honestly couldn't put it down because I wanted to see what escapade came up next.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to a friend, but I agree that it's one of those \\"you're either going to love or hate it\\" type of things.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|So far the app is fine.  I downloaded it after reading a User's Guide for Kindle Fire.  But I do like that it tells me how much time I have left for whatever activity I want to do. I'm sure it will become more useful as I become more familiar with my Kindle.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books ,to my surprise I couldn't Put the books down. It also leaves you wanting more. The intensity the seduction,the passion and love that radiates from these books is breath taking.  I laughed , I cried and  was over come with passion.  Great books! Every one needs a little Christian in there lives.
0345803485|1.0|Completely, totally, utterly awful!  It took me 4 months to make myself get through this and I am not happy to have finished. Anyone that says this book is kinky or hot, well I am so sad for their sex life. The sex was almost 100% vanilla with an occasional spanking.  Ohh in a tub, shower, blah blah blah. But sadly, the sex scenes were the most tolerable. Ana is whiny and almost pre-pubescent in her emotions as is Christian. She is a beautiful, no a stunningly beautiful virginal college graduate that has never ever even touched herself 'there' (written here as childishly as in the book) yet her first sexual experience, with a man with a huge penis.  How does she know this, she has nothing to compare it too, anyway I digress. Her 1st sexual experience and every one after she EXPLODES in orgasm! Really? Christian has the sexual stamina of, what, I guess a bunny since they are know for doing 'it' all the time. He can just go, then go again, the beautiful, well-hung self-made billionaire that never works has quite a sexual appetite, and proclaims he has never had 'vanilla' sex. Pretty simple rubbing her 'there' a little oral (from him not her, ya ladies that happens all the time right??) then wham-bam thank you ma'am, next explosive orgasms.<br />Are we done yet?<br />I think I must be into BDSM because only a masochist would force herself to read this book to the end.  Is that my punishment Mr Grey?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I like this show a lot... Hope to see more in the future. Buying the season is better then just one show.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|OK, I really like The Weather Channel. I go there for all my weather.  I was very excited when I saw this app. I do wish I could access the travel maps from this app.  Maybe you can and I just haven't figured it out yet.
B00637D114|5.0|i enjoyed it very much but my kids loved it more so thank again u guys seem cool lol thanks
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|As usual the narrative is carried along at an absorbing pace by masterly dialogue.  The sense of time and place puts it beyond the realm of a mere detective story.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Dream from My Father<br /><br />Good Read Find out about the Author and his road in this life<br /><br />This is new read for me I found it to be very in lighting how we cannot know unless we read for our self.<br /><br />Recommend to those who want to  find out for themselves there own conclusion of the read.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Oh my goodness, they have really out done themselves this time. Space it hilarious.  The animation is great.  Those pigs really make me laugh.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I enjoy the story line and the actors on this TV show.  I do not have TV per say and keep up with my favorites by getting the season.  Really like the show!!
0765325950|1.0|No ebook is really weak.  What a transparent money grab no matter what Sanderson (who I love) says on his blog about the legacy.  Everyone has ebooks, so it should pretty much be a level playing field on the rating. I don't purchase hardcover any more, no space, so it looks like the library if I even bother.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is really fun if you like hidden objects/mystery/adventure games! It is free for part of the game, but then if you want to continue it costs $2.99. But I think it is totally worth it though! Cool storyline, nice graphics, and thought provoking! It is pretty long too just for a 3 dollar game!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds has been a favorite of my ever since I first saw it.  I'm glad I finally have a device that can handle it.  I love playing.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I watched 2 episodes of season 5 and went and bought the full sets of seasons 1 thru 4 and am watching them over and over - Castle and Beckett are a great combination and all the characters are well acted
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The mix of humor and vernacular terminology were refreshing.  I enjoyed this book entirely.  I especially found the author's use of 70's TV/music particularly amusing.  Great read!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game because there are so many little games to play! They are simple, but they can be fun!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I downloaded this app after reading &#34;User's Guide for Kindle Fire&#34;. It was recommended that this be downloaded. I'm still not totally familiar with all the features.  However, I have used it's video feature to play videos online and they have worked wonderfully.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I watched 2 episodes of season 5 and went and bought the full sets of seasons 1 thru 4 and am watching them over and over - Castle and Beckett are a great combination and all the characters are well acted
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Bought 1,2&3 from diferent vendor-now we just need 5 to make it complete!We love this program,but definitely not for the under 15 or 16 year old.It's pretty violent,but I doubt that it's inaccurate. Kurt Sutter created a really  great show,which is totally worth watching time and again.Can hardly wait for season six! The storylines are very well thought-out and the whole ensemble of actors are excellent and believeable.Season four has the best extras i.e: commentary and extended episodes/deleted scenes.<br />If you haven't seen it,you're missing something very special! Love it!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|There is nothing I can say about Newman's music because it consistently outs language as the blunt instrument for communicating moods, states, atmospheres, context, beauty, and pain that it finally is, in our times.<br /><br />My ears do not miss Adele's tune and I am glad not having been forced to purchase it.<br /><br />The music is, as usual, so well crafted, so appropriate that the audience forgets it even exists, not to speak of realizing that the music is the psychological soul of a movie.<br /><br />It's that natural even though the sonic blends feature highly precise use of exotic timbres, synthesizers and electronic instruments, as well as masterful restraint and use of orchestra... all at the same time yielding an organic whole. He most convincingly tears down artificial barriers between digital and \\"analog\\" creative paradigms; everything serves the exact compositional vision and becomes... well, real music. With or without the film.<br /><br />It's no wonder that he always gets nominated for Academy Award but never wins: Newman and the people he works with are so good at what they do, the audience just forgets that there is a musical component to a film.<br /><br />Severine, New Digs, Shanghai Drive, Quartermaster, Komodo Dragon, Modigliani, Skyfall, Adrenaline... but all of them really.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I didn't really like this app. It just wasn't what I was looking for. So I uninstalled it a picked a different one.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think that it is a great book and a amazing read for all ages.<br />But I also think that this book is also kinda funny in the first part.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fantastic and enticing read.<br />The book keeps you interested so that you can't put it down!<br />I have recommended it to all my girlfriends!!
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|I love Tim Burton movies, but this one was jusy not one of them. It was more like one of his shortfilms turned into a full length feature by adding a bunch if filler. It was cute, but it lacked the overall strength that his other films carry throughout the movie. Burton's films usually entertain a wide age group but this one was not as captivating for older kids such as myself. Overall, it was not bad, just maybe better as a shortfilm.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like being able to get to my Facebook on my Kindle.  I'm still learning how to maneuver through the app but so far it really hasn't been that difficult.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks. You can't help but love the characters and get pulled in to their story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing! I didn't want it to end! It made me cry and I couldn't put it down and I usually hate books and reading! But this is just amazing!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. The keys are very easy to use. I love that it has the percent key. It looks great and feels fabulous works like a charm.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I just wasn't impressed with this app. I'm not really sure what I&#34;m looking for in a calculator app but this is not it.
B00933JF74|3.0|I love these types of games. This particular one,townsmen, isn't great. Hopefully a dev will come out with a better one soon. The purchased premium version gives you a little bit more prestige but you could go through prestige points extremely fast. Avoid using the tax collector or carpenter - it's a waste of prestige points. The game board or foot print (whatever you call it) is tough to move around at the edges. The premium also gets rid of the ads which were frequently in the way. For most people it makes no sense to buy the game and prestige points really aren't difficult  to earn anyway. Faults aside it's still an addictive game. Oh and the game freezes on a regular basis.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A great continuation if the Jack Ryan series.  Can't wait for the next one.  This is a great author and a great on-going series
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was recommended to be by several people, of different ages. Both my retired friends and my daughters, loved it. I recommend this book highly. A really good read
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Or maybe I'm just not good at this type of game. The game seems to just dead end with no place to go.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very nice App. It is easy to use and  a must have  for the kindle. It is a basic calculator so not good for very complicated math but perfect for budgeting and balancing your checkbook.
B0053O89JM|5.0|this item was AWESOME! and it arrived early! LOVIN IT!!! Can't believe I own the whole series now! Hugh Laurie never lets me down!
B00AQK4EWY|4.0|That I would be able to read this in French again.  But it's so hard to find hard copies easily of foreign language books.<br /><br />But Kindle has absolutely changed my reading.  And the Dictionary feature has made everything easier.<br /><br />Thank you Kindle!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Slow start but quickly pulls you in. Sounds a bit like Pretty Woman and very repetitive!  Don't know whether to like what I've just read or not.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|As far as I can tell,this app does not continually run in the background so there is not a drain on start-up.I am using this App on my Kindle Fire.It does just what it says cleaning up unwanted files or history.Very easy to use , have used it now for 4 weeks  no problems what so ever. Works really really well.
B005KELQEU|5.0|It protects my paperwhite and gives me peace of mind when leaving it in a backpack or suitcase.  It's padded and does the job.  You can't beat the price!  I didn't want a cover that would add weight and bulk, so this is perfect.  It's not &#34;fancy&#34; and isn't going to impress your friends, but it's a good fit and does the job.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Kinda cheesy. Enjoyed the first movie a lot more... But it was still fun to watch. I've enjoyed the action scenes in both movies.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Will keep you reading, hungry for the next page and sad when you run out of pages to flip. I anxiously await the sequel in 2013. Highly enjoyable reading. Would recommend ages 10+.
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Karl Urban did an excellent job as Dredd and the story set up the world well. I just wanted more story to go along with the action! Overall, it was entertaining and a recommend if you are looking for an action fix.
0891419063|5.0|An amazing memoir of WWII, with reflections of life and war that will make you think for a long time coming.  I am very glad I read this, and it made me feel more connected to the Corps as a whole.  However, anyone could enjoy this book and learn a great deal from it.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I got this series for my new daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift and we have all enjoyed watching this series from the beginning.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|just like cut the rope. unique and fun. challenging but not too hard. the graphics are awesome and on my kindle fire first gen it runs perfectly smooth. I must say my favorite part are the pudding monsters babbling ...<br />I believe this app will be a &quot;top Lister&quot; for a long time to come. job well done!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book! So proud of our military! This book will have you on the edge of your seat not wanting to put it down! AMERICA!
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|I RECEIVED THIS DVD YESTERDAY AND I LIKE IT, IT'S VERY SCARLY I WOULD LIKE TO BUY OTHER ONES LIKE THIS.
B005H29GSI|3.0|Tnt box doesn't open when you hit it, the catapult doesn't work properly, the birds barely fly and do it just in one angle, my seven year kid prefers to launch them with his hand, some birds look a little weird, like the yellow one. Definitely Mattel could have done a better work in designing this toy.
159562015X|5.0|I like this book because it picks your top 5 strengths and explains them in words that describes you, and the descriptions are pretty accurate. In the beginning it may even seem that the book knows you better than you know yourself. I took the test twice and got 3 of the same strengths the second time, so in total I have 7 unique strengths predicted by the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read  took me to a different world. One where hope and fear exist as one. Enjoyed reading it especially after watching the hunger games movie.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Keeping in mind you're NOT watching this movie to see an Oscar-worthy picture, 21 Jump Street is a pretty awesome ride. Tatum and Hill have pretty good chemistry, Ice Cube is back from that family-friendly \\"Are We There Yet?\\" shadow, and the humor is definitely geared towards my age group (18-25). For a good mix of comedy, cop-drama, and action, with a pinch of 80s nostalgia for the older crowd, I'd say go for it. 5 stars.
0765325950|5.0|Epic series, and a great book all around. Thanks to Brandon Sanderson who finished off this series once and for all.
1608870081|5.0|Kids really enjoyed it they had read the book and had seen the movie so thus was just perfect. Thanks
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I chose five stars because this sequel could not be put down!!  It was fast paced and full of interesting detail.  I can't wait to read the final book!!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Saw this in the theater with my little cousins. They loved every minute of it. The magic, the \\"cool guys\\" in the holiday heroes, and the story wasn't half-bad.  Easy to follow for the youngsters but fast enough to keep the plot going.  I was entertained by the whimsy of the story, the \\"I have a purpose\\" storyline, and some of the Russian-Santa gags were pretty funny. Enjoy!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Great book, it was a joy to read. I really like Brandon Sanderson as an author. My only complaint about this story is that I wanted more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book has all of the twists and turns you'd expect from Stephen King.  Another great novel that I'd highly recommend.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book and gave it as a gift.  It's great for racing fans but also a warm hearted human interest story.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie portrays the facts in true historical detail. Remarkable acting and stunning realism. True historical period wardrobe, sets and props. Stunning cinematography and hard hitting sound effects. A-list acting by all actors. This movie is educational, emotional, and shocking. This movie is A-List quality and put together very well. A classic for all to own and to appreciate. Highly Recommended on Blue Ray. Thanks
B001PMLKLK|5.0|yes ui\it arrived in time as they said it would, this is a wonderful singer, and plan on buying more of her music.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wow!!  This is a superbly written book.  The author has a great style that really paints a picture for the reader.  You are drawn in early on and feel like you know the characters.  Excellent.  Can't wait to read book 2.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This story is an all time classic that give the vampire all of its default traits. An excellent read for anyone looking for an intense original story.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie is visually stunning after the first 40 minutes, and has elements that are reminiscent of Avatar. However, this movie will never be the next Avatar, but has borrowed visually stunning elements and effects from Avatar. A brilliant adventure, based on the book, with some modifications. Stunning CGI effects, Sharp piercing Sound quality, and Cinematography.  Wardrobes, props, sets and Acting were all top quality and to A-list standards. This movie will keep you on edge and will hold your attention all the way through. However the first 40 minutes are the only dry and dull area in this movie. The movie is produced very well and will leave you awe struck. This is NOT a rent it kind of movie. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thank you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is a lot of fun to just kill some time with and not really feel like you are wasting your time
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He loves Steely Dan, so he couldn't wait to hear this! Good purchase.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fabulous way to watch season 3! I will be telling my co-workers and my family about this.  Thank You Amazon.com
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|Did not see the movie but was curious about the book. Did not realize it was solely for junior high school kids.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|this book seemed to deviate from the tone of the first two book.  The characters became very mushy and very needy.  I just did not enjoy it.  I also felt they did not fully develop the side story and that made me feel it was lacking.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I missed the first season, so I bought it and watched it in one day.  Great show, can't miss it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched the first season on Netflix and was hooked!! Another fan told me I could go to Amazon.com and order the season 2 to watch on my iPad.  Now I'm caught up and am looking forward to season 3. This is an awesome way to watch!!! Absolutely loved it..
B0071DJZZA|5.0|OMG! I love this book! I actually wish that the movie was a little more like the book! The book was so moving. It had so much feeling inside it! It described so much in such great detail! I can't stop thinking about it now! If you have doubts about this book, just go with me and buy it! The way that Suzanne Collins left this book left me hanging and now I am so going to buy the next book when I get enough money!
030758836X|3.0|This is a decent book.  It is definately at page turner at times but I feel the ending was lacking.  It left a lot of loose ends and made you go &#34;huh?&#34;.  I would of rather borrowed it from the library.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a series I know that I will read over and over again! I love the characters  christian & anastasia! the story is interesting and the action is hot hot hot! I really loved it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So many twists and turns. The ending will bring you to tears and leaves you wanting more. When is Season 4?!!!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I used to love books by this author but after reading the last few I am disappointed.  Same old story lines, only difference is that Safe Haven is not even believable.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Our kids love this, you can play with other people and I believe its the same app they have on the iphone 4. Again its free so get it while you can. what fun!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|What would you do in this situation.  The guy is smart.  Right or wrong, you gotta give him that.  I won't be doing more product reviews  because this min. word requirement sucks.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I purchased this mount for my 24&#34; display and was originally worried since it's intended for smaller displays. However, my display weighed less than the limit so I figured it was worth trying.<br /><br />Setup was very easy, as the arm comes fully assembled with the side-mount clamp and the 75 mm VESA mount already attached. I just had to attach a 100mm adapter to fit my larger display and then I was in business. The mount works really well and the size of my display doesn't seem to be a hindrance at all.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers have noted that the display only supports about 8&#34; of vertical lift. However, this didn't prove to be a problem at all for me. I was able to position the display everywhere I wanted on my desk and the lift was more than sufficient to allow for rotating the 24&#34; display into vertical orientation.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the height adjust requires pushing a button on the swing arm, and that button feels really stiff. It makes it difficult to adjust the height casually which is a bit frustrating. However, this is my first arm mount so I don't know if that's a standard limitation of arm mounts.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for their first LCD arm mount.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|Funniest show on TV. That's all you need to know, now watch and be entertained! Cool. Cool Cool Cool. Seriously, watch!
B001DPC52C|5.0|I just found this group and really like them, there is a nice quality to her voice and the band can actually play which is nice.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|If you have read the book , the movie is not as good as the book but its still a good movie .
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Great gift for kids. We like it very much. A little scary from the beginning for 2-3 years so by pass the first few minutes for them. The rest is outstanding for anyone. Our kids loved it.
0345803507|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this last part. The sex is very predictable, boring even. We finally get to know more about Christian's past, but I feel as if the author could have told us a little more.
B002ONUAY2|5.0|Okay the orginal lead sing is back and this cd is AWSOME a must have for any DD fan. all the songs are great well done and needs to keep going. TURN IT UP and enjoy.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love the movies by the Kendricks. I am also super happy to see my pastor Ed Litton in this movie!!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|We grew up watching this movie for Christmas and I wanted to introduce it to  my kids as well.  Such a lovely story, wonderfully animated with a haunting score. I still cry every time I watch! Definitely a favorite in our house.
0345803485|4.0|It was definitely better than expected. My mother said it was 'nothing but sex' so I was surprised to find more than just that. There is definitely a good storyline. After finishing this book, I immediately bought the second!
B009GJCFL8|5.0|this si a great show case for a asia show the cds are great and show how groupes should sound live. The dvd how ever is great if you close your eyes they have not aged well and need better cloths but there sing and playing is wonderful.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My granddaughter has been reading Harry Potter since she was a kid and when the movies began, she added them to her collection. She was estatic to find that I found the 8 film collection. I received it in a timely manner and in great condtion.
0547884591|5.0|I gave this book as a gift(s), the recipients both enjoyed it very much. It is a well rounded book!
0345803493|5.0|I have to admit that I liked this book way better than the first one. The story is very intriguing and the characters have more depth. What I loves about it was the way the relationship between Ana and Christian keeps changing and evolving as they try to find a balance.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|for years i only ever saw the tom baker dr who and now we have better stories (sort of) and better special effects I find most of the stories very good but a few completely stupid but it  is dr who
B008AITJ24|5.0|My granddaught watches this program; however, she did not have this season. She was happy to get it in Blu-ray and add it to her collection. She loves it!!! It was received in a timely manner.
B00884GR0W|1.0|dont download this app it is boring and nothing like minecraft<br />plus u have to collect the blocks whi h i hate about it
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|its not to often a single movei in a relatively unfamiliar catagory could spark so much hype with its release. love ghost in the shell, series movies and games
B002E9HACG|2.0|I bought this cd because of some of the reviews given on how great if is, well they are wrong the is nothing great about this cd<br />it is not hard rock its more like a desperate try to just release a cd that nobody should buy.
145210655X|4.0|This was a funny gift for the father of a Star Wars loving boyfriend, it was fun for them to share the joke both seeing it unwrapped, I don't get some of the humor, but they certainly did:) However, I don't know the difference between the various SW movies. For someone who does, this was great!
1450419895|5.0|This book is a must have. Frederic Delavier has done it again, great pictures, lots of useful information on each muscle group. Helps you really set up a workout plan
B0044XV3R8|3.0|Stunning graphics. The story works well as science fiction at first. Then if fades into 'Dances With Wolves' in the future. The 'Noble Savage' stuff doesn't work for me. Yes, the exploiters were bad.
B004WO878W|4.0|these limited ones were supposed to be sold at target but good luck finding them there or on there web site.<br />I have enjoyed watching these and adding them to my collection.
1595825045|5.0|At first I was skeptical about purchasing this used, but I was totally proven wrong when I got it. The condition is like new and I love the illustrations. I'm a major Avatar fan, so getting this book was a huge deal for me. I hope the creators come up with a book for Legend of Korra as well.
0736092269|5.0|Frederic Delavier's books are a must have for both beginers and experienced gym/fitness people. It really helps you understand your body and workouts to impove on certain muscle groups
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Not sure about ratings sometimes, figured four was a good number. I bought (rented) it. I watched it. I liked it. The price was reasonable. And the product was not faulty. The end.
1451620829|5.0|1st let me say I love KISS and grew up on them there showes are the best and Ive seen alot of concerts.<br />I knew this book was going to be a tell all but I had no idea that peter was so full of himself that he believes he has any talent<br />much less more than gene,paul and even ace.Peter take some responsibilty for his drug use but blames everyone for it.<br />In truth the book is quiet entertaining but you can tell when he is full of it.I feel sorry for his wife when he talkes about there sex life which is sad. He praises eric and tommy at one point then trashes them in another.seems to me he need to have reality check about himself and his ability to release cds and play music by himself. at one point he goes on about his cds not doing well<br />and blaming kiss the record company and his fans for not getting how good he thinks they are. He states the last cd was so good from his heart that when it wasnt worth his autograph that came with the cd he just cried and cried. he needs to get a grip.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I originally bought this book for my kindle when I heard an adaption was released in theaters. I like to read the book to compare it to the movies. I haven't yet watched the movie but the book was breathtaking. Highly recommended
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best I've ever read! Can't wait to finish the series!! Amazing book. I really recommend it! So good
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this, first of all it was free! Second it is a general calculator and I like that you can see what you are doing while you are doing it so you don't have any chance of forgetting what you just did, then having to start over again. Its a great little calculator. Thanks
044655667X|5.0|Connelly just keeps writing the best. I have read many of his books, and I am never disappointed.  Keep up the good work.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I am always intrigued by books with mystical aspects.  I loved how this book connected today's technological world with old traditions. What an interesting place this bookstore would be!
B00AZVAE1E|5.0|I think I've watched every episode of this series and have found it to be entertaining and I love the characters. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the updated Sherlock Holmes and Watson but Lucy Liu is wonderful and Jonny Lee Miller is fabulous as the modern day Sherlock Holmes. As another reviewer stated I am SO SICK of so-called \\"reality\\" tv shows it's refreshing to find television can still be well written and acted and fun to watch!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|it's the best christmas movie ever. Some of the acting is a little corny, but that was the style back then. The over-all movie strory is wonderful. Makes my wife cry every year.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is what I call my home away from home. I can create beautiful boards of clothes, shoes, hair, makeup, homes, and even recipes. I have made so many recipes from this site that have become HUGE HITS!! :)
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I have enjoyed Kate Morton's other books. I enjoyed the deifferent characters and flet for them.  I loved the twist of this story, it took me by surprise.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love Grisham books and have rarely been disappointed by one.  This man can really spin a good tale and keep you turning pages.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I'm getting used to it and am going to take advantage of it in the future.  My Kindle is AMAZING!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love that I can check what I'm watching, track what I'm buying and keep up with what I'm selling. Amazing app...
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I've always loved the story of this book. This classic really draws me into it and keeps me interested in continuing to read it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I don't think I've ever had a Vince Flynn book I didn't thoroughly enjoy and had a hard time putting it down.  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspense and mystery.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fun show to watch with adults, lots of surprises and odd plots  .  It is not a show for children!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very smooth, not glitchy. Really easy to use and everything's right where it should be. Would definitely recommend to others.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love this app! I find myself using this one almost every single day of the week! It is very easy to use and looks great on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD!
0345803485|1.0|Ugh.  I can't believe that I actually caved and began reading this trilogy.  Fortunately, it was given to me as a Christmas gift, (which I had requested), but now I feel completely ashamed that someone else knows that I had a desire to read it.  And that someone else had shelled out the money for it.<br /><br />I am only slightly more than half way through in the first \\"novel\\" and I think that I might kill myself.  I cannot believe how atrocious the writing is, but on the other hand have discovered that I could easily compose something myself, have it published, and then make a buck!<br /><br />I have to admit that I am disgusted by the agenda of Christian Grey.  In my opinion, he should be arrested and charged on the grounds of sexual abuse and containment.  His \\"openness\\" that is poorly displayed by the use of a consensual contract is merely a manipulation tactic.  He has got some serious issues and stupid Anastasia Steele should have been knocked out and sent into a coma by all of the red flags smacking her in the face.  Excuse me, but if this were me, and if someone made me that uncomfortable, there is no way in hell I would stick around to see whether or not I was going to end up getting raped and murdered and thrown into a creek.  Although, since she was dumb enough to give in to this freak, I suppose that they deserve each other.<br /><br />In my version of the end of this trilogy, (or preferably first book, since I don't think I can muster up the strength to hold off on doing something productive), Anastasia ends up consulting the advice of her protective and loving father, who nearly has a heart attack after learning of the abuse, goes to purchase a gun, conspires a plan to catch him in the act while simultaneously involving the authorities, and Christian goes to prison.  All previous (I'll call them victims) victims, are contacted with the surprising (NOT) news that all along Christian lied about really having AIDS.  What?  He lied???  He is then ambushedby all victims outside of the courthouse where he is convicted of 16 counts of being a pig, and the whole city of Seattle-scratch that-London, breaks out into a huge riot and all of the corner shops are robbed of their tea and foils.<br /><br />Meanwhile Christian goes to prison, accompanied by his sex toys, and lives in the hole for the rest of his sorry life.  Then he dies.  No,  he is raped and beaten by other prisoners until he dies.<br /><br />Anastasia, now living with HIV, attends support groups every day for people with the disease, more meetings for people that have experienced sexual trauma, and is denied any of the internships that she was offered due to the fact that she has become a raging alcoholic and drug user.<br /><br />The End.<br /><br />As for the writer, this woman can't be serious.  Personally, I think she somehow miraculously fell asleep-scratch that-passed out while drunk,  while holding the cut, copy and paste functions on her laptop.  I can't wait to get past the droning, redundant and painful sex scenes every six pages.  I have figured out why there are so many, in case anyone was wondering, it is because both parties can't last for more than three seconds, and the frustration that the writer had while trying to compose a REAL, erotic sex scene came to be too much, because her lackluster characters kept having orgasms before they were cued to.  The writing is rhythmic, predictable, and stuck.  I don't have much faith that anything will change in the quality of this series if I continue torturing myself.
0451232852|5.0|Here is another really good story by the great Ken Follett.  Get a copy, you'll be so glad that you did!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Definitely a funny book. I didn't think it was predictable at all. Would definitely recommend to others. Can't wait to read more like this.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Excellent game to play! I will find yourself playing this game for hours, killing your battery! I recommend this one to everyone who likes the original Angry Birds.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's books on Mitch Rapp. I would recommend reading them in order-find the list on Amazon. I love these suspenceful novels...fast reading..cannot wait to read the next one.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is nice and enjoyable. I got it to play on my new kindle fire and it works out great
1613821670|5.0|The book came so fast ! I ended up getting a 3-in one-book. Now I can read Frankenstein, Dracula and thus other story. It's amazing. Completely satisfied
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Love the game, hate the apps. That's about it. Don't know what else to say about this version of Angry Birds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent-suspenceful.Would highly recommend this book. Have seen the movie, but enjoy the book. Cannot wait to read her next book.
B002PYW26O|5.0|I really loved Lost in Space when I was younger, and the movie was just as good.  Its a good copy and I really enjoy it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I heard about this game when it first came out and then I played it. Another family fav. Its great for when you are waiting on something, instead of just sitting in a daz.
B0086700CM|3.0|Excellent game to play! I will find yourself playing this game for hours, killing your battery! I recommend this one to everyone!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Fun to play! Can't think of much else to write about it. Daughter plays it mostly and she likes it.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|Not finished reading all of it yet, so far so good. I'm glad I got it. 4 more words required
B007SYWFRM|2.0|We love the movie but this app did not want to work for us for some reason, so we are hoping that a newer version will come out.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Somewhat of a waste of money in my honest opinion. Looks good but that's about it though. I use it maybe once a week.
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie from start to finish is what true comedy is all about.Seth Mcfarlane and are reminiscing of Richard Pryor and redd foxxand the days of the not ready for prime time players of Snl or sctv and fidays this is what comedy is supposed to be pushing the envelope of life like Sam Kinison didnot like hollywood does today ripping of movie goers with over hyped recycled garbarge they keep reusing over and over thank you Seth for your comedic genius!
B00002SSKI|5.0|I loved this movie in my adolescent years! Very much a chick-flick. Now watching it as an adult I love the memories it brings back.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter love this problem solving game, we even got my ex husband hooked on it too LOL It is super fun too!
B009MCRHH6|3.0|A friend introduced this game to me when he was playing it on his iphone. So glad it's avaliable for android devices.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|What ho!  Jeeves and Wooster get 20 stars!  And I just wish there had been 100 episodes.  We watch all these episodes beginning to end every year or so, maybe more often.  Sometimes we rewind to watch scenes a second or third time, especially if both Fry and Laurie are in the scene.  At least watch once for the foreground and again for the background.  (Not correct technical terms?  Best I can do.)  Good Lord!  The acting is so good and every scene is packed with hilarious content.  Tickety-tock.
0316010669|3.0|Very insightful. I talked a lot about this book and the new ideas it gave me when I read it. I dont know if I buy into every point made within the book, but I defenitly enjoyed learning the new ideas, and even though I read it two years ago, some of the ideas I got from it come back to me and help me understand the split decisions I make.
B0086700CM|4.0|Really like this game, it would be better if you could change characters. It is one of the favorites and is fun to play.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great! I love using this app. Very user friendly. I use this at least one to two times a week.
034580404X|5.0|Read the books and passed them around to friends so much that they were badly frayed!  Glad to see a set as a lightning deal and snapped them up!
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|Very fast tempoed song, if your in the mood to dance or exercise this is a MUST HAVE! It has been my favorite Black Eyed Peas CD to date.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|You can not access your games on facebook which is sucky. You just can not do all the things you can on a regular desk top.
B00APUQPX6|2.0|I liked this Ice age, but the orginal was the best. It was kind of pointless to make this Ice age, but it turned out ok enough

B00ARAO0WM|2.0|This is an ok enough show. Nothing great about it, it was ok. I wouldn't say I hated it but it wasn't great
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the style in which the story was written - his side, her side . I thought the ending was too abrupt - maybe because it was my first Kindle and I didnt realize I was close to the final pages.
B000003RCY|5.0|It's Rammstein, what can i say? It's my favorite band now i complete my collection. The best band of the world.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.. I love being lost in a good book with romance and alittle suspense.. I read it in 2 evenings!!

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Season 2 is so captivating. I sat down and watched it in 1 weekend.  I am hooked. Can't wait to catch up pn the rest of the series.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|It's Rammstein, what can i say? It's my favorite band now i complete my collection. The best band of the world.
B005544V6A|2.0|First episode showed promise.It was entertaining and witty, with potential relationship development between the two main characters. The second episode turned very mean-spirited, and lost the charm the first suggested. We've quit watching.
B009X01C64|5.0|This is the third Marware case I have purchased and I think it is the best.  The materials used are good quality.  The case is designed to look good, protect your Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and provide you with easy ways to work with it in different orientations.  It protects your Kindle by firmly holding it in a hard plastic shell.  Once it is snapped into place, there is no risk of the Kindle falling out of the case.  The shell protects all sides of the Kindle, but there are access holes or open sections for the charging, on/off switch, volume control and speakers.  The leather case is your second line of defense against damage.  It covers and cushions the Kindle if dropped.  What really sets this case apart from all the other cases it its revolving design which allows you to view your Kindle in landscape or portrait orientations.  The design is simple, very easy to use and your Kindle is secure in either orientation.  If you like to read or watch videos hands free, this case is perfect.<br /><br />The only negative I have found is there is no angle that is flat enough to type comfortably.  You can still type, but your hand position is more like pointing at the keys rather than playing them like a standard keyboard.  Since most of my Kindle use is reading and viewing videos, typing has not been an issue.  I also have a blue tooth keyboard for serious typing.<br /><br />The old adage &#34;You pay for what you get.&#34; really applies to this product.  It is one of the most expensive cases for your Kindle, but for the reason I have outline above it is well worth the price.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I give this season 5 stars! It is an excellent follow up to the previous seasons. Really suspenseful.....anxious to get the remaining seasons & see where the writers will take viewers.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My whole family enjoys this game from the youngest to the oldest.  Good for developing physics concepts in kids. Love it.
1451695195|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It gave a very interesting perspective to the 'near death experience'. My husband is a medical specialist. I passed it onto him and he is not so skeptical about the possibility of an afterlife after reading it! As two fairly committed atheists we still do not hold a religious view of life after death however, we do believe that there is more out there than science will currently 'allow' us to believe. I highly recommend this book.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|I hate to say it but this was a get it in the can type movie I thought it would be an action movie what they shown on tv was the only action, the rest put me to sleep. I love to see Washington's movies he should have stepped up to the plate and said no I will not star in this. He played a pilot on drugs at the time he saved a lot of lives. The air lines found two small bottles of alcohol he drink and put in the trash can and the movie starts from there.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Ick.  I saw it last night with my brother.<br /><br />I think I understand what they were trying to do.  When this play is on a broadway stage, the characters are so small and far away it would make it very hard to see what was going on, so, with the movie, they zoom in on everyone's face to show the world what they were missing.  They wanted to provide the world with something they haven't yet been able to.<br /><br />From my perspective though, it just looked like a bunch of extremely unhappy people putting their face RIGHT IN MINE and screaming at me for three hours.  Everything was a close up.  Wait, let me rephrase that, EVERYTHING WAS A CLOSE UP.  Wait, let me rephrase that:<br /><br />E V E R Y T H I N G  W A S  A  C L O S E  U P !!!!!<br />F O R  T H R E E  H O U R S !!!!!<br />A N D  E V E R Y O N E  W A S  S I N G I N G  A S  L O U D L Y  A S  T H E Y  C O U L D !!!!!<br />R I G H T  I N  M Y  F A C E !!!!!<br /><br />No disrespect to the actors involved.  They were all doing their best and played their parts well.  I also love Victor Hugo's story.  I love it.  It's the sort of story any Christian should cling to desperately as a perfect example what Christ was trying to do during his lifetime.  This particular rendition of it though bothered me greatly.<br /><br />I highly suggest that you see the \\"Les Miserables\\" that featured Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush and Claire Danes instead.  That one was a miracle.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This record is phenomenal. At first listen, I must admit I though, \\"well, this is 'OK' but not great\\", but then I kept listening to it. Now I can't put it down. Like earlier Soundgarden albums I had to get used to teh temperature of the water. I needed to let it simmer and basically it has not only grown on me but I am now addicted to it. Aggressive at times, soft and playful at other this record has a huge depth which can be overlooked on an initial listen. The riffs are as heavy as ever and it's easy to see how the rest of Soundgarden affects Cris Cornell and why it always felt like there was something missing on his solo efforts. This is a complete and lush recording and should be seen as something far beyond a money grab or \\"comeback record\\". It is its own \\"animal\\" to use the title. I highly recommend this. Clearly the most relevant \\"grunge\\" band at this stage in history is still Soundgarden. This, to me, represents the best effort any 90s band has put together in the post-grunge era. Awesome. Love it.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I generally don't read novels in this genre. The talk about anticipation of first kisses and petting was definately for a teenage audience, but the plot and character development were mature and held my interest to the end.
B008HK3XYK|1.0|It was a gift for my grandson's girlfriend. He had gotten her the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. The case was just what she wanted even the color was her favorite. the case was even better than we thought it would be. Very satisfied.
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|*1.5 Stars*<br /><br />In case you didn't know, this is Katy Hudson's (I mean Perry's), second album. Her debut was all the way back in 2001 when she was a Christian good girl. But since the US mainstream doesn't accept anything less than the debauchery so present in pop culture, Katy was going to have to undergo a major overhaul in order to get the attention she so desperately craves. After a long string of failed starts and tearing through record label after record label, she finally found Glen Ballard and the Matrix. With their help, and the assistance of countless pop crafters (Max Martin, Dr. Luke to start the lengthy list) they Katy was able to rework herself into a bona-fide attention whore (emphasis on the whore). That is what she wants after all, attention. And nothing personifies it any better than \\"One of the Boys\\".<br /><br />If the lead single \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" doesn't clue you in to the carnality this album, then don't worry, it will become so obvious it flies in the face of Katy's old Christian image. As catchy and irresistible as \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" is, and \\"Hot n Cold\\" is also another exceptional pop song, the rest of this album plays like one tired and repulsive stereotype and cliché after another. Indeed, `Kissed a Girl' only plays into the bi-curiosity of the teen culture in 2008, but at least it still has a strong vocal performance and a pure pop production to match. But the quality stops there. \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\" is another tune with a good beat and confident vocals, but it only promotes the `throwing away your money' mishap that so often happens in Vegas. \\"Ur So Gay\\" uses an offensive slur to only widen the gap between heterosexuals and the LGBT community. And the added `penis' at the end really shoots down any respectable aspect of Perry. Basically, \\"One of the Boys\\" is homage to all of the gross, risqué, repugnant, and utter trash of the 2000s decade. Between the tales of Katy `laying face down in porcelain' to her juvenile attempt to bashher lover by calling him a `mannequin' instead of a man (really creative insult Katy), what you are getting is what the mainstream wants to hear. But what makes this album an utter joke is the closing track \\"Fingerprints\\". It claims that Katy wants to break the mold, but if she were to examine her behavior: singing whatever messy rock-pop is thrown in front of her and sinking down to the crass image of the pop machine is not breaking the mold, it IS the mold. Katy is a lot of things, but so far, being original isn't one of them.<br /><br />She can either make her long-fought-for breakout into pop music, or she can try to show off her talent, but unfortunately she cannot have both. Even more unfortunate is the path that Katy decided to take. But rest assured, she is not completely un-talented, and even in \\"Thinking of You\\", it's obvious that even she's disgusted with the image she's been forced to adapt to. If you take this at face value, not a millimeter more, then this is just enjoyable pop music. So congrats to Katy, she's managed to finally put herself on the map, but has also tarnished the name of pop music (among other things) in the process.

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|No surprises here. Just like the ugly cover filled with abrasive leather and piercing colors, \\"Hard Candy\\" is a grotesque product of hypersexuality and desperation, something that Madonna pulls off rather well in 2008. In order for any interest to be had with the album, she shamelessly plops down on a chair and takes on the persona of a rejected stripper, one filled with disdain for the position and has had more than her fair share of \\"sticky sweet\\". Subtlety is not part of Madonna's vocabulary, yes, but she has never been so in your face about her image than she is here. So which came first: the chicken or the egg? Or rather, Madonna's image or her music? It is impossible to separate the two because with every new album she's had an accomapnying new image. But \\"Hard Candy\\" is a flat-out wrong new image.<br /><br />Perhaps Madonna is tired of the cold shoulder she's gotten in the new millenium: she started with \\"Music\\" in 2000, which was her last true hit album since 2003's \\"American Life\\" was panned and 2005's master-work \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" yielded no true hit singles (in the US anyway). There's a huge vibe of contempt and disinterest with \\"Hard Candy\\", as there is no musical ambition, no re-inventing. Madonna is on the cover, she sings the songs she's co-written with Pharrell (a move taken only to sell her ever-growing pop empire), but somehow, this album feels like Pharrell, Timbaland, and Justin Timberlake formed a hip-hop group that features Madonna, not the inverse. In fact, \\"Hard Candy\\" is her only album where she does not take the reigns and commands the entire studio to fit to her vision. For some reason, she tries stepping through the motions of her collaborators and is actually given them control. This change of pace obviously works against Madonna; she has not made herself a master dance/pop artist by playing it safe. Her countless re-inventions and new musical directions are what made her previous albums (besides \\"American Life\\") such masterpieces of pop. Madonna is an innovator, so why sell-out so late in her career?<br /><br />As always, Madonna fights the clock, she is 49 after all. It's never been so more apparent that she wishes to stay relevant to a young audience, going so far as to bare her sexuality so much to the point of quasi-pornography. Even in 1992's \\"Erotica\\", she has never been so blatantly sexual as she is here. That's what the mainstream loves in 2008, but Madonna is better than this. This might just be her riding out her Warner Bros. contract, and a more cleaned up album may await us, but right now, all the mainstream is left with is this electronic mess. It's a hot mess, yes, and it definitely can be enjoyable in small amounts, but taken as a whole, this is just a plain mess. She is drowned out by the booming synths, the product placement put in by Pharrell and Timba-Lake, and the roaring drum machines of this stale piece of hard candy. It's not sugary, it's not sweet, and even Madonna can't pull off the illusion that it is. \\"Hard Candy\\" is by far her coldest, most calculated, and lifeless album to date.

B00ARAN9JW|4.0|I cant say that I was blown away by the movie, but it was still highly entertaining. There was something missing. A layer of cohesion wasnt there, but I still enjoyed it. Definitely waiting for the next one to come out!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a great book you should read it!!!<br />When your done you should read the house of Hades!<br />Coming out fall 2013!!!!!!!!!<br />All so read Cane Chronicles if you already  read Percy Jackson series
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|I got this album because I heard phonte influenced drake at some point. I had heard one if his tracks (brand new) a couple of years ago and it was fun and smooth. But this album is annoying. The singing suggest some sort of sentimental yearning on the surface, but when you listen to the lyrics closely they are as dumb as it gets. I really don't care if it is smooth or gangsta, excellence can manifest itself in various ways. But this ain't one of them.<br /><br />The production is very pretty and spacious, but never deep or interesting. The album ends up sounding vague and lazy. No lyrics, no beats, then what am i supposed to get hooked on? I have given it a fair chance because of the rave reviews. It has been playing in my car for well over a week, but this morning it made me furious. Why am I trying to get into this crappy, wimpy, meandering music?

1442359315|3.0|It is illuminating to have the phenomenon of near death experience discussed by an author with the medical credentials of Dr. Alexander.  His perspective helps to establish the neuroscience of a pre-NDE, as well as to distinguish when we are in a realm beyond the reach of physical science.<br /><br />His experience is genuine, and consistent with the many reports of people who have experienced near death, and his ongoing research in the subject is likely to make a considerable contribution to the field.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander is to be applauded for stepping forward as a neurosurgeon, a scientist and a human being with a tremendous and life-changing experience.<br /><br />I would part company with any interpretation of the experience itself - its meaning, message and the proposed commission to Dr. Alexander.  Here we are on complex and metaphysical grounds, where I believe that an equal amount of intensive research into the faith-based literature, as well as engagement with a team of faith-based experts is indicated, for any credibility at all.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|One of the best albums i have ever listened to. Calvin Harris is the best! Highly recommended for anyone who loves music.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I decided to get the book after much thought due to the negative reviews I saw from others who had already read it.  However, if you are completely submerged into this story, these characters, its wonderful to get a little more on each of them.  There is a lot of back and forth and nothing seems to get resolved, but that's fine, there is still at least one more book that can make that happen.  My concern is now, I heard he was only going to write one more book and although they are extremely large, I would like for everything not to get resolved in one Chapter at the end, I would like for the story lines to pan out and be lengthly just like everything so far.  I can't imagine how everything will be resolved in just one more book actually.  But, we'll see.  Can't wait for Book Six.

0817439390|5.0|I have read about dozen books on photography, but none of them captured my attention as much as \\"Understanding Exposure\\" by Bryan Peterson. It offers the most comprehensive and revealing explanations on the subject and more, which will leave you with two things: knowledge and better pictures. The author will take you through the \\"mysteries\\" of exposure step by step and give you his tips and secrets to produce truly amazingly looking photos. Of all the books in my possession about photography, this is the only one I would take where ever I go. Would give 10 stars if it was possible!!!

No freezing screens as in the other version I had (you'll see reviews from summer 2012 &amp; that's the version I had, this is a totally new and improved version) and its easy to pin things you find onto whatever board your heart desires. Thank you for this app pinterest, I will be so happy I have it later this afternoon after a wisdom tooth extraction!

B0082P6JZA|4.0|The precept of Frank as the Transporter continues to hold up in this third installment due mostly to Staham's chemistry with his Ukrainian transportee.  While Statham is almost always good in anything, plot and supporting characterizations do matter. There are times when the villain sounds preposterous in his monologs and the father of Statham's charge represents the flimsiest of reasons to care, but when this movie focuses on the action and on the interplay between the two, chauffeur and  girl, trapped together to the almost-bitter end, it's a great piece of entertainment. My third viewing of this film and it still is fun to watch.

0345803485|1.0|The horrifying fact that this disfigured, mangled, editor-less, mindless piece of \\"fanfic\\" drivel which was originally posted on a \\"Twilight\\" fan website has been passed off as legitimate literature is the single biggest con job/rip-off in recent years. The author (and I use that term loosely) has absolutely NO writing skills whatsoever. Apparently, neither did the editors and original publisher.<br /><br />Christian Grey is (of course!) the wealthiest man in the galaxy, has the perfectly sculpted body of an Adonis, and is better endowed than Johnny Wadd. Anastasia Steele is, get this: A college age woman with supermodel looks who is a VIRGIN. Yeah okay. Anyone who read past this point at the beginning of this book is an absolute fool. I won't list the aggravating endless word/phrase repetitions, the gratuitous spelling/grammatical errors (sandles!), the gross misrepresentation of American culture/behavior by a Brit, or the author's obvious BDSM naivete. It's all been pointed out in countless other reviews.<br /><br />The subject of BDSM in literature is nothing new. Moreover, nearly all of the activities that take place in this book are relatively commonplace among the sexually comfortable/adventurous. Also, if you do some research you'll find a wealth of books on the subject that are extremely well written, and were published way before this crap appeared to all of the clueless women, bored housewives, lame wallflower girls, nerdy chicks, and vanilla females the world over - who with a puzzlingly idiotic enthusiasm lapped this garbage up like a cat licking dry a large saucer of warm milk. Save your money, and buy another novel on the subject. ANY novel.<br /><br />Women of the world: PLEASE don't lower your standards ever again!

B0082XKGGU|3.0|I am not a Stoic scholar by any means, and so must review this work from my layman's point of view.<br /><br />First, this book is a tough read (compared to modern books) because it's written in the ancient English of its day, with lots and lots of thous, xxest verbs (doest, thinkest, etc), and abstract words such as Nature, Virtue, (and others) that had different meanings in Roman times than we assign to them today. So I found that I had to force myself through the book.<br /><br />Even the translator's comments say that much of Aurelius' text and thoughts was disorganized, obscure (no easy meaning could be found in his words), and corrupt (undecipherable) in places. So it's definitely not an easy read.<br /><br />The last section of the book contains a summary of Aurelius' views and thoughts, written mostly in modern day language. I recommend that you read it first to get an overview of the main book content.<br /><br />The main value of the work seems to be in the Stoic principles and personal thoughts that are made visible by the personal writings of an Emperor of Rome. Reading this work disabuses you of the notion that emperors had an easy life just because they were emperors.<br /><br />As for a more interesting and accessible explanation of Stoic principles, I recommend [[ASIN:0195374614 A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy]], which is a professionally written, much easier, and more thought-provoking read than either Aurelius or Epictetus. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the Stoic school of thought.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Easy quick read. Entertaining. Simple no long narrative. One of those books that you don't need to think while reading, just sit back and enjoy the experience. Was written just the way she speaks. Enjoyable and recommendable.

B0094M68BA|3.0|It is a decent movie, the only reason I gave it less than 4 stars is because I enjoyed the first one so much. This is a good movie, just not as good as the first one. If you loved/liked the first one watch this one. It is worth the rental.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I was on a search for a case that would fit the adapter that I have in my car but also had a rim around the screen's face on the phone.  I have no idea how much money I wasted and no one seems to have one that fit my criteria.  FINALLY I found this case!  And YES it fit perfectly.  The adapter that I was trying to fit was for this device: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BAZFGS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6<br /><br />The fit could be slightly more snug around the side buttons and I could do without the a-hole or apple hole in the back cover but other than that, it seems like a great case!  I've had it for about 3 weeks now, no functional complaints.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Good movie. I laughed a lot at the beginning but the teddy bear bad language got old.  It is funnier that a lot of so called comedies that are coming out.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Got a high definition TV and a bluray player. What's not to like about Star Wars! It's like seeing it for the first time.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|You kind of know what you're going to get. I never felt like the characters developed, but they were all very likable and the movie a pleasant way to spend a Friday night.
B008VBYN80|5.0|like lots<br />I am having lots of fun playing. I like the concept. the battles are fun. hopefully I can win some more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazing first hand account. Makes you grateful for all that is sacrificed daily for our freedom.  These are true heroes that deserve to tell their story.
B008Y6SA36|5.0|Super awesome action film. Great zombie film. Probably the best.  Got me started on zombie flicks. Best one of the series.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This is a good read, lots of action and other stuff going on.  Really enjoyed the fun parts<br />and of course,the detecting was pretty good also.  Like this series.
B00001QEE7|5.0|jop po pojj po p oj p o poj p oj p oj po j poj p j p j poj p j p
B0084QQQLY|4.0|Everyone should read this book, it will expand your ideas about life. Really gives an insight into how to be innovative.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer had some nice unexpected twists.  I always enjoy a good book that leaves you feeling glad you read it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|well what can i really say about this collection it really speaks for it self but the best part is the claritty of the film on blu ray. It really makes you feel that feeling of joy as he wins his matches and the mushy hart felt moments really make it a tear jerker as well. sylvester stallone at his best as usual just kind of sad for him that his son passed away from the fifth one. may my prayers go out to him and his family!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a free book and I thought it was pretty good. I read it pretty quick (which is unusual for me). Good read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game!! I am pretty good at one suite &amp; hope to get enough practice to graduate to two suites.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This Was A Great Film Kinda SadThat The Other Actor Died I Felt He Did A Great Job, How Ever This Actor Pulled It Off And It Was A Great Film As Usual. I Have To Say The Warrior Princess Lucy Lawless Really Brings That Fire And Heat To The Movie She Is So Attractive Great Job.
0765325950|5.0|Awesome ending to awesome series. Non stop read. Couldn't put it down. The very end was a little pat and would have liked for more closure for Rand al'Thor but overall very pleased with this epic final.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is amazing. Love everything about it. I had a really hard time putting it down... would recommend it to anyone that likes a good love story
B003TSEEDY|5.0|An amazing book that opens your eyes to the world.<br />It will become one of your favorites books. I promise you.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|My daughter is almost 4 and we love this movie.  We rented it when it was first released on DVD and just need to buy it.  We really love it.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I just bought this and was hoping to use it in my classes starring next week though I am in slot of science classes where we wrote about of equations and diagrams. You can draw but the drawings aren't pit in the notes which is where I'd like them to be, if I could put equations and drawings in the notes it would get five-stars.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is my favorite author and I try to read all of her books.  This one did not disappoint!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Takes itself a shade to seriously - all action - the prior version blended humor in to make it more of a repeatable watch.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I became interested in the Piano Guys after searching Carol of the Bells on youtube. My girlfriend and I were mesmerized by their videos. We literally spent several hours watching them that first night. I was hesitant to buy the cd afraid that the music wouldn't be as powerful without the spectacular video. I was wrong. The music stands tall by itself. This is an incredible collection of works. The blending and &#34;call and answer&#34; of the piano and cello is refreshing. These are truely talented musicians. This is a great CD for anyone that enjoys classical  and pop/rock. They blend respectful musicianship with a light-hearted playful attitude. My favorite track without question is &#34;Michael Meets Mozart.&#34;
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It was believable that Jaycee wrote this book herself (with help along the way) - what a sad commentary on our parole system as a whole who could have ended her torment years earlier but kudos to those who went above and beyond and finally saw that something was wrong.  I think this is a &#34;must read&#34; for parents to share with their children.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Controls are difficult to use and once you get so far you do have to pay to go further. But then again it is just a free preview.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This is a beautiful story and gorgeous film.  The colors and detail superb! I watched in HD and loved every minute of it.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|At first i was excited to play the game but then i found myself confused as to what i had to do to complete the level... not really entertaining.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|Though perhaps ironically so, as it's not his screenplay.  This brilliant film explores a love triangle, of sorts, but does so from a decidedly odd perspective.  Working for the first time in his career from someone else's writing (Erin Cressida Wilson's) the film is still infused with Egoyan's usual elements and obsessions.  But what's attracted me to this film is that, unlike some of his others (Exotica comes to mind), the plot actually all adds up.  No one's behaving in ways that don't make sense in retrospect, just to support the dream-like feel of the narrative.  The ending - in a single, heartbreaking image - reveals Julianne Moore's Catherine to be every bit the cold, heartless woman who could do the things she's done throughout the course of the film, without any idea that she'd done anything wrong.  Liam Neeson's David is the man who's still married to her, and who still loves her, but who isn't all that anxious to get home every night after work.  He's as good in this as he usually is, which is to say he's very good.  Max Thieriot as their son Michael is similarly solid and believable, but it's Amanda Seyfried's turn as the enigmatic Chloe that makes this a stand-out.  Essentially her first 'grown-up' role, she delivers a performance that is so raw and desperate - under a facade of absolute control - that at times it's almost embarrassing to watch.  This is definitely one of the best films on the resume's of all of the artists involved.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I heard so much about this series and had not seen the first two seasons and happened to catch the one hr revisited.  LOVE at first sight so ordered the series and was not disappointed.  Of course, now I am a loyal follower<br />The quality of the programs is terrific.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Since I am a Matrix Fan, this is a great compilation !! I have watched it like hundred times, never get tired, very nice.<br /><br />It fits perfectly my Matrix Collection !!!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This series is absolutely hilarious. With John Cleese as the proprietor of a bed and breakfast and has little patience with his guests. We've watch this for years and had to replace our VHS with the DVD as we missed the laughs.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|The book was slow and somewhat boring despite the subject. It is a young adult book and reads young. If someone asked my opinion I'd say it was ok.
B0064ORVCQ|1.0|Got this for my son for the holidays. When he wanted to watch this movie, he couldn't get it out of the cover. The outer cover was taped by the new upc over the old one. Once he got it unstuck the top of the case itself was completely broken and cracked. He went through every disc and they were unharmed. Don't really know what to do about this but try and get another case for the movie discs. Not very happy at all.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|this product sucks, I regret having bought.<br />not recommended at all.<br />I want my money back<br />the kinect does not work well with the above
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. it is so cute.I absolutely love Littlest pet shop online and as toys for my kids. they are adorable.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Why wouldn't you want to listen to Morgan Freeman narrate a movie that he stars in? Tim Robbins' acting is amazing and the story gives you hope. Yes, HOPE!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Easy to use, seems durable and functional.  The price is right.  Fast shipping and well packaged.  The Kindle clicks into four clasps at each corner, holding the unit in place.  When you open the cover, the Kindle turns on automatically versus having to push the power button.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The whole family fights to play this game.  We just absolutely love it.  It's just like the carnival game but you're not losing a bunch of money playing it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Convenient,  easy. My son uses it all the time for his homework. Since I always have my kindle, I always have a calculator.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|We just love this game.  My 9 yr old keeps stealing my kindle to play it.  You collect animals from the wilderness and put them in your own zoo.  You have to feed them as they get hungry and earn coins for it to buy other zoo things.  Very fun and addicting fast paced game.
B00061HJ4S|5.0|I did not start on this model right away.  The detail for this model is so amazing that I need to make a trip to the AF Museum to take tons of photos of the Flak gun on display there.  I want this model to match the one on display.  Tamiya amazes me as always.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun game for those with a lot of time on there hands.<br />Good graphics. A lot of thought was placed into the design of this game.
B0068FYZLG|4.0|Great movie.  Everyone should have it!  Was a joy to rediscover.  Thats all I have to say about this particular purchased item.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|i loved the frst book and this book never disappointed you can actually feel emotions and roller coasters the characters go through.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It works just like I hoped. The MacBook Pro shows the battery at like 20% all the time, even when the mouse battery was fully charged overnight, but I just ignore it.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|So interesting. I love this book and cant wait to purchase the other books. This is probably going to be my new favorite series!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great app.! Graphics are terrific. Love the features like auto finish. Would never want be without it. Kudos to the developer.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|It delete your progress randomly! Gets so annoying, after u play the apps 5 times.....U WILL WANT TO DELETE IT
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was an easy read and kept me interested throughout. I haven't read Harlequin romance books in years and am pleasantly surpised!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is an AWESOME game!!! It is about the only game I play these days. It is SO COOL! I love it!
B004BSFC46|4.0|My baby's attention was really captured by this product!  He loved these, but sadly he is a big guy and outgrew them very quickly.  He still like to play with them, but we cannot attach them to his chunky wrists.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I love the ESV Study Bible. It has an easy way to understanding God's word without taking away from the message.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|If you love Angry Birds, you will love BAD PIGGIES. It is just as fun and addicting as angry birds and a lot of laughs! fun for the whole family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book deserves all five stars, can't wait for the movie!!!!! Couldn't put the book down and I am now on to the next book<3
1401307450|5.0|This biography tells everything in a very straightforward way that keeps you rapt. I know I slept very little and read as much as possible just so I could find out what happens next. And I was not disappointed.
0393061310|5.0|I've learned a lot about the development of human societies and that geographical resources have more to do with cultural development than a difference in intelligence.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I mainly bought this CD because I had remaining gift card balance that dropped 70% off the price, and this was the only CD I needed to complete my own killers discography. Then I started giving it a chance and listening to it and I liked it better than my original prediction of one or two songs.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the verse of the day it provides. I like that you can choose what version of the bible to read. I don't like it is sometimes challenging for me to find actual chapter and verse and just not use to using an electronic version.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Although I bought this CD for just one song,&#34;Little Talks,&#34; I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the other songs
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Such an awesome movie. This movie keeps you on your feet, and makes you laugh harddd. Just a great movie. Can't wait for new one :P
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This movie satisfied my needs - I was looking to pull out a movie from the vault and surprise my significant other, and I did just that for a cheaper price than I thought I would
B002BVOYBW|5.0|One of our Family Favorites!<br />Quirky and odd - and not just because of Johnny Depp (although his Buster Keaton impressions are hilarious).
0375847227|5.0|This gigantic novel saves me the time of going to the library and having to rent all three books individually, where the one I need will inevitably be checked out/lost. Plus, since it is so long as a combination of all 3, it seems to never end, which I am fine with
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I ORDERED THIS VIDEO THINKING IT WAS, AS INDICATED ON THE WEBSITE, A &#34;NEW&#34; VIDEO...I DID'T OPEN IT TO VIEW IT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE IT CAME ALL NICELY SEALED AND IN THE STUDIO MANUFACTURED CASE.  WHEN I OPENED IT A COUPLE WEEKS LATER TO WATCH THE VIDEO...I DISCOVERED THAT SOMEONE HAD MADE A COPY OF THIS MOVIE ON A DVD-R, &#34;WRITTEN&#34; ON THE DVD IN BLACK MAGIC MARKER THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE!  THEY COULD HAVE AT LEAST PUT A HOME COMPUTER MADE LABEL ON THE DVD!<br /><br />I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY HAD TO NERVE TO SELL THIS BOOTLEG VIDEO AS NEW!  IF I WANTED A BOOTLEG VIDEO, I WOULD HAVE BOOTLEGGED IT MYSELF OR BOUGHT IT FROM THE LOCAL BOOTLEG MAN FOR 3 BUCKS!!!  I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!!!  THIS IS NERVY AND ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE... I HOPE MR DANIEL CRAG REALIZES THAT IT IS AGAINST FEDERAL LAWS TO BOOTLEG VIDEOS AND RESELL THEM.  I WILL BE MAKING A FORMAL COMPLAIN TO AMAZON!!<br /><br />THIS IS ... UNBELIEVEABLE!!!  MY FRICK'N GOODNESS!!  THE &#34;NERVE!!!&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. I have had no issues to date. Don't need anything more than this simple but functional calculator.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Prob the first book I've read of his since the notebook I loved.Great storyline.Show's woman that change is sometimes the best choice you can make.
B00005RDRO|4.0|Great comedy.  A great way to relax with family and take one's mind off the frustrations of the past week.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It is a great show with many innuendoes going on. The acting is very good specially Mandy Patinkin that in my opinion steal the show I hope season 2 is in the way to be release in DVD or Blue Ray
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Music helps concentrate. Seemingly simple puzzles make you scratch your head real hard. Would highly recommend this to anybody
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Great Soundtrack just like the movie!<br />Both of my daughters borrow it too! I would highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.
0307730697|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who's ever thought the deck was stacked against them. This story isn't about how one's life ends, but how it's lived.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love solitare, and wanted to add it to my new Kindle.  It's not that easy to play, but an acceptable game.
B00062PN6I|4.0|Works well for its designed purpose. Excellent product for the price, great substitute for the $200 brands. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare set of quality headphones.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book is a grim but real conclusion to the series that honestly made me accept the tale for what it is. A great story told in a dark but lesson teaching way.<br />Real or not real?
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I have almost all of the Beatles albums, a few of George Harrison's, Paul and Linda's Ram album and couldn't pass up this new entry of Paul Mccartney singing the classics.  Well done and easy on the ears.  Music you can relax to and enjoy.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I found the book fascinating and enlightening.  It gives a good but less than complete picture of what goes on between former presidents.  By incomplete, it is not a fault I find with the author of the book since I'm sure full disclosure was not available however it raises so many questions as to what the content is of some of the interactions that it is frustrating... I think this is a good place for people to imagine the questions left unanswered as to why the presidency is considered a curse after the first briefing in office.  I don't think we can imagine and the book doesn't speculate which is good but now it is out there... for us to think about... and wonder about.
B003AYMZO2|4.0|Sometimes Breaking Bad is truly stupid. The plot goes kind of berserk. But, on the whole, I like to watch it. )(
B006CQLGXG|4.0|I am enjoying the book. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that there are very many words that I'm not familiar with. I appreciate that I can instantly find the meaning on my Kindle Fire.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|The movie starts in a promising way, also considering all the good actors in it. Then, it becomes boring until, in the end, it disappoints. )(
B008YWY0HK|4.0|You may or may not get your DVD damaged from their cheap flimsy packaging efforts. It's a gamble each time you order DVD's.
B009IF8CH6|3.0|Penny is getting fat, Sheldon is more of a pain. I have gotten to the point that I fast forward through scens with Sheldon in them.<br /><br />There is less each week that is funny. It has gotten to be a sad show.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Saw this video on tv, and bought it for our grandsons.  Great movie, lots of excitement, and they loved the dragon encounter!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I had another brand with an earlier Prolific chipset and it just failed.  I pulled it out of my laptop bag, plugged it in and the driver wouldn't install.  Tried it on another machine and the same thing happened.  I went looking for drivers hoping my driver had become corrupted and I found the latest Prolific driver.  I installed it an still nothing.<br /><br />However, the new driver's readme file states that the older chipset has reached it's end-of-life meaning it wouldn't be supported going forward and Prolific recommended that OEMs start using the chipset in this USB to RS232 unit.<br /><br />That's a long explanation as to why I have this one, but I thought the information might help someone else.<br /><br />This one worked right out of the box and since I already had the latest driver installed, I didn't even need the CD.  Also, this unit says it supports Windows 8 already.
B0056JJXOO|5.0|Graet music, Juliet excellent!!! Romeo very convincent!!!<br />We really loved it!!!<br />highly recommend it.<br />We would see it again and again!!!
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|I love tower defense games and had played many uninspiring games, prior to stumbling upon this gem, that were not well executed and not much fun.  The game is more of a \\"tower offense\\" game, flipping the traditional tower defense game on its head.  It is a combination of strategy and action - planning your route, building and upgrading your squad, and then navigating through the chaos once the action begins by laying down smoke screens, decoys, and repair zones in order to destroy the towers that dot the landscape waiting to destroy your squad.  There are a variety of vehicles to choose from and a wide array of enemy towers to destroy, or in some cases, avoid.<br /><br />Anomaly distinguishes itself from an app environment full of \\"Freemium\\" games that nickel and dime you, seemingly more concerned about how much money they can make rather than how much fun the player can have, and poorly made games that can easily run you up to $6.99.  Anomaly has proven to be well worth its $3.99 tag, with better graphics than most and exceptionally fun game play, it is very addicting and by far my favorite game purchase made to date.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I know, it looks a little simple, but it's actually very entertaining.  Start at the easy levels and work your way up.  You can settle for just solving each grid, or stick with it till you get each one perfect -- no unnecessary moves!  I've worked my way up to the 14x14 grids, and those actually make me want to bang my head against the wall, so, i'm considering just starting over with the first level :-)
B004W1GCQO|5.0|The best show ever....I watch it over and over and over again!!!!  Its a must buy for everyone to watch!!!
B001F6TXME|5.0|It is a nice accessories to add to your Nikon camera. You will not be disappointed in the least bit.
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|didnt have enough time to get into the game without havin to pay for it..wanted to review more before buying
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a blast for all ages. The various skill levels keep you engaged and entertained for a long time.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|Hidden objects, memory match cards, find the differences and flip to create a puzzle.. all my faves in one game. I highly recommend this!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Do not start this book if you have any thing else to do!  You will resent the time you have to take off from reading.  King has used his creative imagination to creat a scenario that is gripping and imaginable.  The outcome is far from what you expect.  I have recommended it to many reader friends and so far no one has said they didn't like it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  It was not predictable and had a great story line.  The author made you care about the characters.  I'm not sure if there is a book 2 to this - but it would be great if there were!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book very fascinating and foundational to speculate on what happens when persons die.  Written by an imminent scholar and a clinical researcher, Proof of Heaven is a blend of empirical clinical observation of the functions of the human brain and metaphysical experience bridging the gap between the known and the unknown.  The book is written in simple language despite the complexities of the subject matter and challenges of describing the unknown.  It is truly an awesome and a must-read book by anyone with avid interest in science, religion, and metaphysics.<br /><br />Anbesaw Selassie
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I got this on the suggestion from the Secret Kindle book of Tips and Tricks. This comes in handy especially if you take your kindle or what you have this downloaded on, with you to different places. It lets you know what is the best WiFi network to use.<br />I like this very much
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Would recommend for those who want to keep up with current events.<br />Very easy to use, lots of catagories to choose from.
B004LROMQG|4.0|I wanted this for a Christmas present, and could find it nowhere.  Amozon had it and was able to get it to me before Christmas!
B007THA4FI|4.0|J.K. Rowling rolls all of the small village stereotypes into one dark and funny romp...she doesn't treat the modern problems of the poor as comedy, but she does poke fun at the pretentions of those in the middle.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|The Secret Garden is a favorite book of my daughter's. When I was browsing Amazon, she decided that she had to have the movie. As always, I found it on Amazon! The movie was new and was delivered very quickly without paying for 'speedy delivery.' Thanks, Amazon!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This was a great movie! It had me laughing the whole way though. I actually ended up watching it twice :)
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I almost bought this from my local Walmart store. I had looked at it and didn't see a price that I wanted to pay. The pricing for this movie was much lower, and with my other purchases, shipping was free and speedy. No problems whatsoever.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I have watched this movie more times than I can count.. It was cheap and shipped right away.. Its a must see
B005KWL2IW|4.0|The return of Joey Belladonna Sets Anthrax back to where they belong Sonicly,They just didn't sound the same without him.Still good to listen to,but it was a different band..
B009XY97VC|5.0|Like Trailerhead, this is the kind of music I listen to at the gym with my earpieces on. A good follow-up to their earlier work.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I have been waiting all my life for a TV show to capture the thrills,and metaphoric nature of Zombie movies.the Walking Dead has done that. Not only do we get the gore and suspense,but we get to explore human nature. such as What makes us Human? how is our society structured,and what would it look like if it went away?not to mention that Zombies are the perfect Metaphor for the mindless Consumer that we all have become.can't love this show enough.
B007918P1E|3.0|I am comparing this album to Classical Conspiracy, so it may not seem fair. What dissappointed me the most was the excessive use of grunts. Although they are important, grunts should be used sparingly like salt and pepper. Too much and you drift into another genre.
B009GESJH2|5.0|If you are a Kid Rock fan you will like this CD as it's typical Kid Rock.  I bought it for Detroit but there are many other statement making songs I like on it.
B0018EO6R0|5.0|This is a perfect example of early Nightwish and a good indication of what was to come as the band progressed. Very sorry to see Tarja gone from the band. Her voice shows how a classically trained vocalist can truly enhance the music.
055357342X|5.0|After reading Game of Thrones on a long round trip flight I couldnt wait to get the second book in the series.  I was so disappointed in the second it took me six months, and another long flight, before I decided to pick up the third, A Storm of Swords, and wow was I glad I did.  Storm continues to develop characters, but also mixes in plenty of twists and turns that will keep you reading well into the night.<br /><br />Without giving away too much the story picks up as if Martin realized the second book was slow, ponderous, and relatively uneventful.  There are so many different story archs going each with its own drama playing out I found myself enjoying each chapter more than the last.  We also start getting exposed to the supernatural with more regularity which is something any fantasy novel needs in some respect or another.<br /><br />If you enjoy cookie cutter, formulaic fantasy sagas you probably wont like this.  If you dont like a story that will take you down dark paths..well be prepared to be disappointed, because the story starts getting dark.  I will say a couple of the characters seem to go through some quick and relatively unsupported personality changes, but that's a small think to overlook when you consider the breadth and scale of what is going on.<br /><br />Cant wait to pick up the 4th book tomorrow.
034580404X|5.0|Great Trilogy!  Couldn't put it down.  Pace of story was non stop.  Never knew what was going to happen next.  So ready for the movies!!!
0553801473|3.0|Where is this series going?  Does anyone know or care anymore?  I remember the Gunslinger sage from King when I was a kid.  Well, sadly I outgrew the story and the same thing is happening here.  When you have a presidential term between books yet don't bother to have any plot progression it's inevitable you are going to lose readers and it's probable the story will never end.<br /><br />Martin has fallen in love with his prose at the expense of having anything happen.  Plus he has this annoying habit of introducing things that seemingly should have some import, but sadly never do.  Even the Stark direwolves that take up much of the story early on fade away until I'm left wondering why they were even introduced at all.  To a lesser extent I'm wondering why we met most of the Stark clan.  Ned's death seems like an eternity ago and have Bran, Arya or Sasha done anything of significance?  Ever?  Most people liked Book 2, but he spent so much time on Stannis only to have him essentially get a complete do over in book 3 I can only conclude his \\"crushing\\" defeat in book 2 was a mere flesh wound. For all his flaws books 1 and 3, and to a lesser extend 2 were great fun full of suspense and action.  Sure there were annoyingly long descriptions of wine drinking, what everyone was eating and how they did both, but the plot continued to move forward.<br /><br />After thinking about this for a few more days I just wanted to add it appears Martin enjoys writing about the details rather than action, and micro versus macro.  I recall thinking this as I read the fairly interesting, morbid but interesting, story arc about Thejon and Ramsey.  It really doesnt have any impact on the big picture, but he spends a lot of time making sure everyone knows Thejon is a broken man.  We already know Ramsey is a sadist, but Martin keeps giving us more and more evidence of that for no apparent reason.  I remember thinking the same thing about the fight at the wall.  Here Martin spent hundreds of pages worrying about the attack, explaining the gathering forces etc only to have it stymied by the Wall and 40 or so Crows.  Then to cap it off Stannis shows up with a few thousand knights and routs the entire wildling army.  Hey, it was interesting reading and A LOT of build up, but at the end of the day it was much sound and fury signifying nothing.  Now we know the real threat is the Others, but frankly I'm thinking if he treats that battle like every other major conflict when it finally arrives it will get a page or two describing it and then it will be neatly wrapped up.<br /><br />At this point I'm convinced Martin has no idea where he's going with the story so characters are essentially in limbo as Martin continues his love affair with describing the world they live in.  This book is no different.  Nothing of significance happens to advance the characters or the plot.  We do get told in detail what everyone is eating and drinking and wearing.<br /><br />So it will be another 3-4 years before the next book comes out, and probably 8-9 before the 7th book.  Even if the books were great that would be a long time to expect people to still care about the 20 characters he's juggling.
B004WESFZW|5.0|I got this as I am updating some of my favorite movies to Blu-Ray. With Blade Runner, the greater resolution brings better skin shading, and a better sense of the immediacy of the actors situation.<br />With the Adjustment Bureau, the sense of ambiance is heightened with the better detail, and the sense of the scenery changes as  David moves from door to door to attempt to meet the Chairman brings his dedication to Elise into focus.<br /><br />I am obviously a fan of Phillip K. Dick based movies, so this is a good addition to my collection. On to Minority Report.
B00138KK1M|5.0|One of the start to finish best metal albums of all time a true class ic...well worth the price. A great addition to my library
B000VZUM5C|5.0|Worth a listen no matter how old you are. Can learn a lot about arrangement from this producer. One for the ages.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really Fun! Always improving and spending! Money stops becoming a factor really soon though, so just spend until you run out of energy.
B004QSYSZ0|4.0|My son LOVES trains and this is a great addition to our collection. Followed other reviewers' advice and bought the chuggington elevated track pack, and glad I did, since it is necessary to use this in double decker configuration.  My two year old can easily move the platform up and down, and loves putting his trains 'to bed'.  You definitely need a lot of curved track to vary the track configuration with the roundhouse on your table.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved the first season and the second one is even better. Can't wait to see what they come up with next year.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is great I don't like the advertizements that come up every time you do a new deck of cards.
B00ANT6OK8|4.0|I'm not an expert on the events that lead to the discovery and eventual killing of Bin Laden. I know some details of the actual raid and events that happened after, but the effort that went into finding his hide out are all new to me. With that being said, Zero Dark Thirty is a fine piece of cinematic craftsmanship and a excellent espionage thriller. The film follows the efforts a female CIA agent named Maya who has made it her life's work to find and kill Bin Laden. We follow her as she assists in torturing captives, tracks down leads(some with results, most without) and slowly puts the pieces of a very complex and frustrating puzzle together. As the film progressed, I couldn't help but feel Maya's frustration. The film sticks to the script quite well, and we're made to follow Maya down every road she takes, whether that road leads to a break in the case or it's filled with road blocks or a dead end.<br /><br />  Zero Dark Thirty does it's best to stick to the details, but it's a process that can leave many people in the dark(no pun intended) The process of discovering and following up on leads is a tedious one, viewers excepting an action packed film maybe disappointed. The film isn't without it's moments of pulse pounding tension. When Maya finally follows the lead that results in Bin Laden's discovery, the film's pace accelerates tremendously.<br /><br />  As a casual viewer(i'm not a current events buff)I enjoyed Zero Dark Thirty immensely. I did find the first third of the film to be a little tedious but I think that's what Kathryn Bigelow and Co. were aiming for. The process of finding and eliminating Bin Laden was a slow and tedious process that wasn't very glamorous. The scenes of torture were left open to interpretation. I felt that the film wasn't pro or anti torture, but it was trying to show an honest portrayal of what the US was willing to do. The film wasn't trying to make a statement or be preachy, which I find to be a difficult task considering thesubject matter. Zero Dark Thirty is an excellent film and one of the best films of the year.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down. I can not wait until April for the next one!
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Good to see a lot of the old cast back (not all, mind you, definite substitutions),<br />CG not bad at all........the story line takes some bizarre twist.....a good watch!!!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I don't use the mobile device much as a result I don't use the Google app much.  So this request is premature.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Have read a number of DeMille books over the years. This was one of the better in the development and specifics of the location. Ending left you hanging and was very abrupt. Left questions to be answered but good read overall.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's hard to believe a show on AMC has stolen my heart, but it has. Next part of Season Three starts in a month, get caught up now!
B00957T6X6|4.0|The only problem I have lies with the kindle formatting.  After the first book the page numbers are counted in kindle pages instead of synching with the print copies.  This makes it hard to talk with friends who are reading as well but it is only a small problem.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|The descriptive language, especially of the Island, its history and culture, is stunning.  I became engrossed after only a few pages and quickly understood the pain and strength of the natives of this Scottish outland.  A good story should always involve environment, weather, culture, and personality -- and all of these elements plus a brooding mystery are handled with ease by Mr. May.
0984725113|4.0|Great book. Very insightful with a bunch of references. Wish congress would read the book. I do; however, wish it was a bit longer.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I purchased this in behave of another person and they were very happy with it.<br /><br />Received promptly and in good condition.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Sometimes a person thinks that John Grisham books get so they are the same.  Well, this one had me wondering what the main character was up to all along -- with plenty of surprises at the end!  Didn't want to put it down!!
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Super fast shipping! The album has all of favorites that you crank the radio up for when you are driving. Good collection of Pink Floyd hits!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is exactly what I needed.  When my current calculator broke I started using the one on my cell phone, which was pretty small and not as user friendly.  I love the big bold numbers and it is very simple to use!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Excellent movie for all of the family.  We watched it on Christmas Eve.  Very, very funny in parts, and also extremely sad in parts.  All of my family were laughing and also crying during this picture.....including teenagers!!!!  I think the teenagers actually realated somewhat to Kelly...totally amazing.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. It protects without adding any bulk. I dropped my Kindle on a tile floor with no harm done so the case did it's job.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Love it!!!  Now I wish to go to India, and hopefully actually stay at the Marigold Hotel, or something very like it.
1451624468|4.0|Lawrence M. Krauss does not suffer from the ambiguity of the rest of the \\"something from nothing\\" philosophical crowd. You see, Mr. Krauss is firmly on the side of science, (which has its own innate disagreeableness). But Mr. Krauss makes it very clear, it may not have all the answers, but science is billions of years ahead of creationism, (13.72 billion years to be exact, since the Big Bang).<br />Mr. Krauss knows how to strut his cosmological stuff. He puts the physical in physics. Empirical charts combine with a whirlwind of facts and figures until the reader, (in this case myself), had to hold on for dear life. (Man, I wish I kept up with developments since high school and college science, but how many of us do?) But, in case you have forgotten your hard-earned course material Mr. Kraus will supply you with a cold dash of reality, and the truth is that much has changed since our time in school, (at least for my generation).<br />And as we all know reality is relative, (yes, Einstein is here too, but he is seen as a Big Bang skeptic). If you read this book you will get a good dose of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, and black holes, and dark matter. But don't worry. They have been there all along, lurking in the shadows of space, (and around you as you sleep).<br />Mr. Kraus makes his proof for the Big Bang, and he says there is reason to believe that our universe will expand itself out of business. There will come a time, (not in our lives), when the cosmos will not be visible from Earth anymore. The real question is will there be any human life left here to observe the \\"nothingness\\"? I guess we could then say we will have gone from \\"something to nothing\\".<br />The concept of a multiverse, (a collection of universes), really got me to thinking. Previous to reading this book I had been exposed to the notion, (and the impossibility), of either a creator, or a natural process, as having started the ball rolling from within. The idea that we could have been given our start from another platform is much more plausible. But then it opens up even more mind-boggling possibilities. Could there be a galaxy of universes? Could these universe galaxies add up to a stupendous larger entity, (and so forth and so on)? Wow, I feel small.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|The story itself is exactly what one would expect. After all it is a well known story. But the illustrations added to the enjoyment.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I saw this in the theater and could not sit still in my seat...I was sooooo excited when it came out on Blu-ray!!!  They are my &#34;all-time&#34; favorite chaps!! :)
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Love all the songs. This was a gift for my husband and he loved the CD. The price was great as well.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Great show!! Great blu ray!!! Great images of Quebec city!! I was there and im glad that Metallica put it on a dvd !! Thanks !!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Gritty and classic Grisham story line- may be a little too classic. I felt like I was reading The Firm plot with a few differences. A decent read but nothing new.
B009AP2G26|4.0|I have been watching Glee on video to catch up to this season.  I love the romance of Finn and Rachel in the first three seasons.  I am worried about Finns story and hoping that he finds his career, which is looking like it might be a teacher. Marley's story line about her eating disorder needs to be talked about more not just ended.  I am a sucker for happy endings so I hope Finn and Rachel find their way back to each other.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this app is almosome I cant dleav it was free<br />its cool I love that dog in there I love the tightest and the animales<br />COOL.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1455519650|4.0|Michael Connelly is just one good author.  Love all of his books.  I'm working on reading all of his books.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|A classic Disney movie.  Every parent needs to have this in their movie collection for themselves as much as for the kiddos.
030758836X|3.0|Well,  it was very different and a bit of a challenge to read.  The last few chapters were interesting, but the ending was just plain pitiful.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|to me the special effects were quite cheesy.  They did little to develop any new characters, and the ending was ho hum.  BOO
1427214948|5.0|These chronicles are some of the best book's I've read in a long time and waiting on the next book to come out. Again these are just a GREAT read.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|great movie from beginning to end.  A bit cheesy in that people get shot a couple times and live.....but overall great.  Makes me want to go watch some moonshiners.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Anyone looking for a calculator app, your search is over! With a simple, yet pleasing interface, and a few buttons beyond a normal calculator, this app is sure to fulfill your everyday math needs.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I'm listening to it right now; I have to say, having a completely untrained ear, I enjoy all the performances. Probably my favs are &#34;One Day More&#34; (for sheer drama and uplifting emotion), &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34;, and &#34;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&#34;. I have loved Eddie Redmayne for several years, and his vocal abilities are all the more reason to watch him closely! The scene for &#34;Empty Chairs...&#34; is breathtaking! I am amazed at the ability of the composers of this music and lyrics!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am happy with my purchase, as my grandchildren love Harry Potter.  My videos came in time for the grandkids to take home after a visit to our home.
B005LAII80|1.0|I bought this, received it in excellent condition, and immediately found it is not watchable. There are no menus. After sitting through twenty minutes of previews, there was no way to begin movie playback; I am using my laptop and Cyberlink PowerDVD 10 Ultimate, which has handled other Blu-Ray discs adequately.<br /><br />That was my first go-round. I download the latest update for PowerDVD, got menus, and got to watch the movie. Extremely annoying, but that's apparently what law-abiding purchasers have to deal with these days. The digital download may actually work--but iTunes says \\"estimated time 12 hours\\" to complete download, so I'm not holding my breath. Since it has to be downloaded anyway, save yourself some dollars and just buy the digital version?<br /><br />Why do I put that in my review? Because I paid for the package deal. Other people may review the movie--I want the buyer to know that a) there is a way to watch their purchase, b) the process to watch it is annoying, but the movie is so good it's worth some trouble to see. Strong acting, the actors seemed consistent with the characters in the comics I read twenty-five years ago. Very, very good direction and cinematography. It takes balls to be true to Judge Dredd. Some movies are weak on supporting actors, but this one isn't. There are better reviews than mine out there, but if you've read this, I expect you'll be able to enjoy this movie just as much as someone who writes better than me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this solitaire. I do seem to win more on this than in other soltaire games. I haven't explored the other options available for this game, to give it a more accurate rating.
B00442OI1C|4.0|Some of the supporting characters are finally back to the First Season standards which made us like them in the first place, particularly Jeff.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have heard so much about this, that I had to check it out. I like it, but haven't been on it enough to truly rate it accurately.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|Good characters and stories drive this show. You will want to watch the second season, to see how things continue, which is all that can be asked of a series.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I really like this because it is a challenge to play the song.  I like how there are different levels and shows how to play it first.  although I got this for my kids just to play a piano but the extra challenge is good I wish it would let us play all the songs shown
