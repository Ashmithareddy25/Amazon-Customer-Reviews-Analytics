B007URVZJ6|2.0|This guide is dramatically low-level, some more \\"sophisticated\\" techniques (for instance, two-level TOC which, by the way, are used in the guide itself) are not covered. More examples would be useful.
B0098VXE50|3.0|The special effects were awesome.  The highlight for me, however was Charlize Theron as the wicked queen.  She was a great wicked queen.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This was a great book. You feel as if you know each character and the families. I can't wait for the third book!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett, always a great writer, has outdone himself.  Have just finished a well written, historical injected novel, that I have enjoyed from the first to the last page.  Can't wait til the third book of this trilogy comes out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game. its.like the old days in color and you get to hunt and kill things<br />you get to find stuff and turn it in medicine
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so addicting.  Just when you think you have the level beat, you mess it up and have to give it &quot;one more try!&quot;
B008A36R2Y|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo14Y3TK1GEMYAA]]Wow the most advanced Serial EVER !!, really is the new way for using serial data in the arduino, I worked with Decimilia and clones, the serial direct. This affected me because of old code I wrote and use from the web. So now I stumble with a RX LED Fixed and non-responsive Leonardo. But just check the literature in arduino.cc Leonardo and worked just fine.
0525953728|5.0|Great book, goes step by step on the mission, it goes into the mission that you don't want to stop reading it once you get to the mission chapter. I would read a chapter a day or so but once I got to the mission chapter I wouldn't want to stop reading the book
B007FEFLTO|4.0|When I get a Ken Follett book, I know I am in for a good long story with many characters.<br />This Book Two in the series is a great story of WWII. The scenes are mostly in Europe and a lot about the Russian army, which I didn't have knowledge of. This is a very well written book. What research this must have taken.<br />My only complaint is that there are so many characters. It's hard to remember all the Russian names and connections.
B00542UMIY|4.0|This is a great family movie. The adults, preteen and 7 year old in our home all enjoyed it. Highly revommended
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Takes a complete look at a navy seals entire history of service. Was and easy ready yet kept you wanting to quickly get to the next page. Gave insights that our military doesn't think a lot of our commander and chief. Hey Obama if you say you are going to invite them over for a beer, than do it!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was well-written and suspenseful.  It gave an inkling of what the SEALS go through, but I didn't think it gave away any military secrets.I'm so glad to know there are well-trained men to go into harm's way and do the things that have to be done.  I sure hope that part of the military isn't cut back to \\"uselessness.\\"
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book gives you something to think about - loved the stories within the story.  You din't want to put it down because you wanted to find out the ending, but kind of disappointed when it did end. I liked all of the characters and how they come together in the end. I've loved all of Mitch Albom's books and although this is a new one, I can't wait for the next one!
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I've already finished New York, followed by Sarum and now I'm almost 70% through London. What a great writer Rutherfurd is! His story telling, combined with the history of each area, follows multiple generations of key families through each major city. Soon, you find yourself caught up not only in the history but wanting to find out what happens to the each generation as they play a vital role in the areas history. There were several times where I truely thought I would loose track of who was who, who belonged to what family and what year we were in, as he wove multiple tales over multiple generations. But, to my surprise, my mind automatically filled in the details as he went from family to family, generation to generation and event to event.<br /><br />On a personal level, aside from the facinating history of each area, purhaps the most wonderful discovery for me was how areas were named and renamed; family names developed and changed and great events made certain areas famous or imfamous. I was also born in New York City, lived in London for several years and have traveled extensively in England. So, each book was like a private history lesson and tour as I mentally walked with him as he described each town, city or area, its history and changes from century to century.<br /><br />If you enjoy history you will love Rutherfurd! If you don't like history you will become facinated by the tales he weaves from generation to generation and the impact they had on the legacy of each city, until you sudenly realize your caught up in the history as well! What a wonderful way to learn!<br /><br />I highly recommend all of the Ed Rutherfurd books I've mentioned, as well as several of his shorter novels I've read centered around WWII.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Amazon video streaming service is not to blame for the mediocrity of this film. In itself the movie is pretty fun but over all seems like middle aged divorce wish fulfillment.
B004JK61K0|4.0|My Road Runner email stopped updating automatically, possibly a problem with ICS. I was advised by Verizon to download K-9, and it has solved this problem. User-friendly, too.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|No instruction buttons so you have no idea what you're supposed to be doing.  Some games can be figured out by tapping icons (and then they move or whatever).
B009LZDGSI|4.0|UPDATE 5/22/13: NO SPOILERS<br /><br />Having just finished watching the season finale, I was pleasantly surprised.  I still feel that the BBC program is superior and I still can't wrap my head around Lucy Liu, as \\"Watson\\".  However, I feel that show has significantly picked up the pace, in large part due to the \\"Moriarty\\" storyline.  Johnny Miller has started to really shine in the role.  I am still of the opinion that 2012 presented one of the weakest prime time TV seasons in recent memory.  My hope is that the Writers can keep up the positive momentum at the start of next season.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS:<br /><br />Nothing inherently wrong with \\"Elementary\\".  It is not unlike a number of other shows currently on TV that are mildly entertaining to watch, though you don't find yourself hoping that an episode extends, nor does it inspire \\"water cooler\\" conversation the next day.<br /><br />Interesting idea to cast a female of Asian heritage as Watson.  I am not sure that I like Lucy Liu in the role.  Aidan Quinn (NYPD Captain) is a fine actor, though he really hasn't been given much to do and his role to date has been promulgated to calling Holmes to request that he show up at one location or another.  Perhaps Quinn's role will expand over the course of the season.<br /><br />\\"Elementary\\" has a small cast, does not rely on any special effects, has a narrow location radius and to date relies much more on the spoken word than visuals.  The aforementioned is not a critique.  However, when a show is set up around 2-main characters and relies heavily on the spoken word, there has to be immediate chemistry and the the dialogue has to be compelling.  While there is room for improvement, I just don't see chemistry.<br /><br />The current version on the BBC (well reviewed on Amazon), is much darker and is layered with geometrically more complexity.  It is the BBC version that would receive my highest recommendation.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it. reminded me of Twilight all grown up. It was like junk food but who doesn't love junkfood now and again?
B005N1E8A4|1.0|Over priced with a really boring theme. This is one purchase where I wished I had returned the item and received my money back.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was an interesting book - I was surprised!  A little \\"Steven King\\" in some ways - it was a little out of the box for a mystery....a bit of psy-fi along the way!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Ive been anxiously awaiting Diana's newest album.  I was so excited when I read that it was going to be released.  What a disappointment!!  What's happened to Diana??  What happened to the rich sultry voice of \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\", \\"Departure Bay\\"???  Her prior offerings were much better.  But on the bright side, Anita Baker's latest album is coming soon.  Better luck next time Diana!
B0061S073A|5.0|I am a mother of six kids so I have several kid games on my kindle. The kids would be playing the games and would hit a wrong button. They would either end up on Internet or Amazon app store every time. I knew I had to find a solution before they accidentally made a purchase. I. decided to give this app a try and have been using it for two weeks. I am completely satisfied!!! This is an awesome free app and would still be awesome if it was a paid app!
B000ICZCZS|3.0|I found it contrived but pleasant. My wife thought it was great. There were funny moments and Hugh Grant is always funny even the writing isn't - his facial expressions, etc are funny by themselves. The kid character was wierd albeit deliberately so but inconsistent.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome! This book set the record straight about how the world's most sought after terrorist was brought down. It is also chock full of information about the incredibly difficult training the SEALS must endure, how fiercely dedicated they are, and how they work as a team with a single-minded effort to do the job, regardless of the political gain for office holders they might not necessarily agree with. Well written and important.
1416585710|5.0|I do not typically re-read books.  This is a book I try to read every year.  It was my first Stephen King book.  I picked it up on a whim at a book store in New Zealand.  While traveling from the South Island of NZ to the North Island (an enchanting road trip) I was immersed in this story.  Though expectedly dark, this book contains a great deal of mood contrast.  It is dark and gloomy while at the same time containing a dream-like ecstasy that can only be created by feelings like nostalgia.<br />This is the kind of book that you live with.  You begin to see yourself in the characters, as terrifying as that can be.  It can create delusions of grandeur in your mind but that's what makes the book so impressive.  It can really get inside you and seems to consume you.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like Minecraft pocket edition.  It is worth $7.00.  However, I give it 4.5 stars because there is too much fog.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|The characters are understandable and interesting. I absolutely enjoyed this book and am onto the second one.  Such an interesting time in our history and with so many characters to follow in this book, it never gets stale; excellent read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Never can I say, \\"oh well, I leafy my Bible at home!\\" because I never leave my cellphone.

The app is completely free because they want you to have unhindered access to this valuable resource. I welcome it with open arms... thanks development team!
B009157BWU|5.0|Wonderful. Endearing and life affirming. I would see it again. The little chimp is beyond adorable, and so is his adoptive parent. Goes to show how universal love is.
B00932A2MC|1.0|This was a dreadful movie.  I was very disappointed. The critics were absolutely right. I love sci fi movies, even the really hokey ones as long as they're at least amusing -- even Starship Troopers, but this was a complete waste of time and money.
B0086DBE62|3.0|I expected this movie to be a little faster paced than it was based on the story it's based off of. Overall it was good just don't expect to be on the edge of your seat at anytime throughout the movie.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follet proves again he's a very good storyteller. Another of his talents is the ability to create characters that can sustain interest for the long run. In this case, for some of them, almost a century.  I'm looking forward to the final book of the trilogy.
0553382152|5.0|I feel I should preface this book review by saying that I am Catholic, so feel free to take whatever I have to say with a grain of salt. I was actually first introduced to this book when I was in middle school. After many, many years I became interested in what some have called Near Death Experiences or Out of Body Experiences. I read many books on the subject, from many points of view, and eventually came back to this book. While I don't challenge the verity or usefulness of many of the new age books, this book offered me the information from a more candid, relatable view.<br />Now, some people seem to be very disturbed that the author approaches this subject from a Christian point of view, so I will stress it again: this author writes from a Christian background!!!<br />Having said that, after reading this book I came to realize that sometimes learning from someone that shares some commonality with you, at least some of the time, does offer some comfort and insight. So to those of you that are still interested in reading about out of body experiences from a more non-religious point of view, I recommend William Buhlman's Adventures Beyond the Body, also available here on Amazon. The author comes from an Atheist background, and throughout his experiences maintained a very open mind. His writings are not religious whatsoever and he offers logical and scientific explanations for his experiences.<br />To those who identify with a Christian belief system, I would highly recommend this book. This book links the spirituality of the Scripture to existence of day-to-day life, offering a very literal answer to some of the questions we still have after studying the Bible.
B0062EKXKK|3.0|...Raised on Radio was out and Departure was in. It would then be a true representation of the classic Journey years.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|It was exhilarating! Jordan is an incredible man, who embarked in an amazing roller coaster in the trajectory of his time at Stratton Oakmont. I simply couldn't put the book down!
B002JUXNOY|5.0|I am a Christian and was encouraged by a pastor to watch this movie.  His sermon was on spiritual warfare.  The movie was scary but was relevant to his topic.  Also, it's a great thriller even for the non-believers because of the different effects and the story line
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Imaginative and unique. The author set the landscape well and kept my thirst for more going. I would recommend this book to those who want to be dazzled.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app is horrible every time I want to download a song it won't let me.It also gave me a virus if you want to catch a virus get it I'm not stopping you.All those other people are lieing saying it is five stars.DON'T GET THIS SHIT!!!!!!!!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Good character development, but found myself bored with some of the detail. It did keep me engaged enough to finish it. Appreciated some of the research references which helped place the book in the larger context of the real societal prison problem
0345803485|5.0|Loved it!  What a wonderful love story!  Could do without all the sex, but it is a great story!  Love the characters and the adventure.  It was nice to see love wins in the end! :)  am so glad I read it myself and did not listen to all the negative reviews.  I think my Husband is happy too!  It gave me the confidence I needed and showed me it is the spice of life that makes it all worth it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is very fun. very addicting. both me and my daughter have downloaded it and compete against each other to see who can rank the fastest!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book provided one amusing \\"coincidence\\" after another, a couple of laugh out loud moments too. Sort of  \\"Forrest Gump\\" situations but even more as the story traces the life and adventures of the protagonist's hundred years where he meets most of the major leaders of the 20th Century by one twist of fate or another. These encounters often cause or alter many of the major events of the 20th Century which affect the whole world. A very different funny story with a host of quirky characters.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|Could not get this app to even download took several days just sitting on my phone to download and would not make any progress, froze my phone. Do NOT purchase.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This was a good book but a bit slow and repetitive.   After reading other reviews i would agree that it is good, but not great.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|most albums have a title, which refers to one song on the album, but here P!nk uses the title of the album on each and every song, as every song provides a different version, or way, to consider love in action.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed this.  Felt like I had an actual account of exactly what happened.  Worth the time to read it.  Even though it is stated it is not politacal though, it was easy to find a \\"side\\" that was expressed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed Winter if the World very much. It has great characters and is full of interesting historical details. If you did not read the first book in the trilogy, Fall of Giants, you won't be lost. The characters from each book are connected, but the two books are independent of each other.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I've seen it twice now and found myself transported each time.  Although Detroit crafted this person in so many ways, it was wonderful of the Swedes and South Africans to bring him to our attention in such a breathtaking, impossible story.  Thank you.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is pretty mindless but it's fun and addictive. The graphics and sounds are well done. My only complaint is that there's not enough documentation to explain what the different elements on the screen mean. Maybe if you play the real-life version of this game at carnivals it's all obvious but I've been playing for several hours total and still haven't figured out what one of the indicators is trying to tell me.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I downloaded the ebay app because I had some specific items I wanted to look for and I wasn't at home near my desktop.  The app is well laid out and intuitive to use.  I would recommend it and find myself using the app more often than going into the office to check things out on the desktop.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|If you like historical novels this one is very entertaining with great character development and a plot that intertwines reality and fiction
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Pages of meaningless, undramatic description.  No genuine conflict until the last thirty pages.  Most of the events in the story don't matter.  Don't bother buying or reading this book.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable and definetly worth the watch. I had watched it before when I was younger and rewatching it now makes me realize that I missed many of the more subtle aspects of the movie. Altogether very enjoyable.
B00906J7KO|5.0|The movie itself is a cute story and you can follow along easily enough but even better if you have seen the first two movies in this series.  Personally, I loved all three movies, but then, I love anything chihuahua mainly because my family raised the little buggers when I was growing up.  They may not be as intelligent as in these movies but they really do have a knack for getting in trouble or causing havoc.  Two paws up!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is really an amazing program, it learns the words you use as you type, and remembers them, there have been several times I haven't had to finish sentences, the words just popped up. I usually don't pay for apps, but I read the reviews and decided to take the free 30 day free trial period.<br /><br />Am I glad I did.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child continues in the Reacher tradition. This isn't my favorite Reacher novel, but it's a good one. I still can't wait for him to get to Virginia to meet up with his successor. Maybe in the next book.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|The bottom line is that I've used these principles in multi-million dollar negotiations and they worked every time.  I review it before every negotiation I have.  Invaluable!

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is a great way to pass the time, while waiting in the Dr. office or in line at the grocery, etc. Sometimes it is not only the birds that get angry.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this show from the first episode.  This season is no different.<br /><br />The story arc for Howard and NASA gets a bit muddled.  A few other things are a bit rough, but overall this season reminds me of a bridge to the next BIG story arc but it does stand on its own as funny and fresh after five seasons.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|You may not like it in the beginning but after a couple times then you will love IT. So awesome that you will be addicted
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Read this book many years ago in high school, but had forgotten all but the basic plot. I guess reading it for pleasure (vs assignment) gave me the opportunity to really think about the quality of writing as I read. Great quick read with a thought provoking conclusion.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so addicted!!! I cant stop pinning!!!!! I need a support group. I have tried a few things. some have worked and some were train wrecks but I keep pinning.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have been a Reacher fan for years and think that this is Childs' worst effort.  I think he's losing it. Example:<br /> His acceptance of Tom Cruise to portray Reacher is crazy.  In this book, reacher is described by a cop as huge like a gorilla.<br />I hope that this was an aberration and he will revert to form ...or goodbye Mr. Childs
B007TML4EI|5.0|At first glance it seems fairly easy and then quickly becomes challenging, especially to make the most efficient defense for the dummy.  I find myself replaying levels trying different strategies all while learning (hopefully) something at the same time.  It's not something I've been playing every day but definitely once or twice a week.  It would be nice if they provided an option to see the most efficient defense.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|Special effects pretty good, story line = same old Hollywood. Handsome guy, ends up saving pretty girl. They fall in love which was very contrived. If you want to watch this same movie different setting with Harrison Ford it was called Air Force One a few years ago on a 747 instead of a space station. Had an element of \\"Big Business\\" putting profit ahead of everyone's safety in a egregious manor... who would have thought... The scene when the bad guys find out one of the hostages is a VIP has the exact same script as other movies of the same caliber. My final thought; don't pay for it, wait and see it on your subscription channels! :)
0307592731|4.0|Very pleased to have read this. I really 'channeled' Ms. Strayed's need for doing the trek Alone. Her solitude as she got stronger & stronger, learning she Had to lighten her pack, pace herself, and truly-finally heal from her inner wounds & demons.  Not high literature, but I loved this book. Somehow knew I would.  Chrys Mollett / Angels Camp, CA
1401322786|4.0|Dor, a man from the time of the building of the Tower of Babel, is fascinated with measuring time. Unfortunately his fascination leads to his being banished to a cave. In this cave he is forced to spend eons listening to mankind's request for more time. After spending six thousand years in this cave, Dor is released for his final mission, teach two humans about time.<br /><br />Needless to say, Dor's release into the twentieth century is somewhat of a shock. He must learn modern languages, man's history, and achieve an understanding of all modernity has to offer. While Dor is learning all he can about mankind and new ways to measure time, the reader is introduced to Victor Delamonte is an elderly business man who has received a death sentence. His cancer has metastasized and is no longer treatable; at best he has a few months to live. Victor decides to use his wealth and attempt to cheat death. Sarah Lemon is an introverted and academically gifted teenage girl. She has no close friends and latches onto the first person to show her any signs of friendship, a popular boy from her high school.<br /><br />Mr. Albom has done an excellent job in portraying the lives and motivations for the actions of the man characters, Dor, Victor and Sarah. He has also deftly tied their stories together, in that the lessons that Victor and Sarah learn about time (wanting more and giving up on it) also impart a lesson to Dor. The Time Keeper is a modern, inspirational moral tale or fable about the precious value and sanctity of time. I found The Time Keeper to be a somewhat fast read, although it did go a little slow in the passages discussing Dor's life. However, the story would not have made as much sense without those passages as they were necessary in order to understand the overall message.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|I was not to thrilled with the game play.  They turning worked at time and trying to use power up sucks u can only use it one way in front of you.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Certainly one of the best books I've read in a long time.<br />The author spins an intricate plot that leaves you turning pages right up to the end, without ever missing a thread of detail.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Whoa!!! This book was awesome!! I enjoyed this one just as much or maybe even more than the first. I was consumed with Eva and Gideon. I could not get enough and couldn't put it down. Great story!!! I am desperate for the third one already!!!!
B004JN1D2I|3.0|The saga starts out promising, with a hint of intertwined destinies and complicated plots.<br />But towards the second book it started to become painfully apparent that the plot was as meaningless as the 'game of thrones' the title refers to.<br />Perhaps intentionally done to point out the fact that all politics of power is ultimately pointless. I also found it interesting that the author would spend roughly the same amount of ink describing a meal, as he would the unexpected demise of some central characters...<br /><br />Nevertheless, books three and four had me struggling for weeks just to keep on reading.
B0086700CM|3.0|Game was very hard to play on the kindle fire. I am not really a game player but this one got many good reviews so I thought I would try it.
B00004BZ16|4.0|i'm one of those untrendy people who doesn't think the clash's first album was their best. i think give 'em enough rope, london calling and this album are their best albums. the thing i like the most is the growth involved. i hate it when a band records the same album over and over and the lemmings just go by it. this is a great album full of various flavours that i found sat together very well. sure there are a couple of songs that aren't fantastic, but so what. great album, buy it, put it on, close your eyes and listen to it.<br />i also don't know why people don't like combat rock, i reckon know your rights is the best song they ever recorded
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book came highly recommended by at least two New York Times writers and it certainly lived up to their,and my, expectations. In short, education is a serious business that is not necessarily always measured by test scores alone. Written in easily understandable language, Mr. Tough highlights efforts to quantify, measure and predict the here-to-fore intangibles of grit, persistence and character and the effect these have on a person's success (success being the only thing Mr. Tough fails to measure). Children of both the poor and the rich receive attention in this volume with a measure of hope for both. I found the section on chess and it's effects on children to be somewhat tedious but presenting a good example of what thinking outside the box should be like. All in all, I think this is an important read for anyone concerned about the future.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Having enjoyed Diana Krall from the \\"Look of Love\\" days when she could swing and sing tastefully, this and other recent offerings are astonishingly lacklustre by relative and absolute standards from a once dazzling singer. Even alas the \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" cover art is cheesy.<br /><br />For those wanting an incomparably finer singer and song/album production, do try Kate Reid's (singer) virtually unknown jazz album \\"Love I'm In\\" (2011), a jazz classic in my view. She sounds alittle like the old DK in passing on some tracks but hardly needs to copy her, so strongly is this album forged.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|great movie, and it actually worked!!!!  It's a shame about the other that was shipped with it, the other movie was an older movie but like I said it isn't worth sending back, we had to go to Target to buy it again.  Waste of money thru Amazon.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This is the unbelievable story of a 100 year old man who takes off and gets himself in a world of trouble. However, he is no stranger to trouble as his past indicates. The plot becomes somewhat convoluted about three quarters through the book but the mayhem continues nevertheless. A fun read.
B002QW7AJY|1.0|I won't ever buy movies from you again, this movie didn't even play, all it played was previews of other movies, and I don't have time to return back to you.  It was only $10. but that isn't the point.  Never again
B007Z9QY1S|4.0|I enjoyed Madonna's W.E. more than I thought. It's dual story line was well done, sorry other critics I did not feel that the modern story line was weak. The sets, costumes  were just luxurious. The way the film recognized how women often give up much of their inner self for love is thought provoking. This is also for anyone who has any interest in Wallis Simpson's romance with her prince.[[ASIN:B007Z9QWVK W.E.]]
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Don't waste your time of money. I'd rather receive socks for Christmas than look at this book a minute longer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After I read the parts with all the sexual \\"escapades\\" I was bored out of my mind and I couldn't wait until I finished!I felt manipulated when the end came and it was intentionally \\"chopped off\\" so I would purchase the second book in the Trilogy, which I haven't done!!!!<br />I'm glad that I read the first one, to get over my curiosity, but I'm not going back!!!!<br />You can sign me \\"Mad\\"!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|These books are all very poorly written, extremely repetitive and have almost nonexistent character development. And even if you are wanting to read the book for the sex scenes, they are very uninteresting. All the controversy over this book was way overrated.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Can't beat the price. Love it. I listen to this every morning at work to start the day off right.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie was amazing. The director clearly knew what he was doing and also knew how to satisfy his Alien fans and keep them begging for more.<br />This movie is a prequel of Alien and it clearly give you an idea of how the alien story begins. The birth of the Queen, was Flawless. Although I have to admit I wanted more. I wanted to see her in action. I am sure the director will give us more about it on his next firm. Indeed a most add to your Alien collection movie.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|It will keep you turning the pages, but it's a far cry from Pillars of the Earth.  I will read the final installment when it cones out, though.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|What a sexy read and exciting read!! Who thought steampunk could be blended with vampires , werewolves and romance? I am typically your classical romance reader and recently into the paranormal novels but this was a fresh blending of the two.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I often prefer just to watch a movie that is just entertaining. This is exactly why I rented this movie and it came through.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Reading the book again after all these years is fascinating and fun.<br />However, it is very difficult to read it because the format is old and not suitable for my reader. I thought that maybe this is because I used an online reader, but I found from other reviews that this is indeed an issue for kindle owners as well. A pity.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this story.  The more i read about Gideon the more i love him.  The love between Gideon and Eva is breathtaking
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|highly reccommend love this game. we used to play this in school its so much fun. if you have kids this is a great way to teach them a few things about trade
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put it down!This is a must read series for all ages,one that can be read again and again
B008MG1E4A|4.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]Good writing style and a good read once you realize that after the first chapter, you have to get through half of the book dealing with SEAL training before you get back to the reason you bought the book in the first place: the takedown of OBL. Good primer for new SEAL recruits. Would have liked more info on the hurry-up OBL burial at sea. Has a couple of subtle but respectful digs at Pres. Obama, but the release timing was a plus for Obama's campaign. Also waiting for a follow-up on what fall-out the author gets for writing without military authority.
030758836X|5.0|Wow. Finally-a fantastic thriller that was unpredictable and wonderfully written. It's sad how in most thrillers written today you can predict the ending twenty pages in-but this novel constantly had me guessing as to what was real and what would happen. In addition, it created two wonderfully written characters: Amy and Nick Dunne. They were extremely three dimensional, horrifying yet engaging people. After this I will definitely check out Flynn's other novels.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I have this on every android device in my home!!! I recommend to every android user!!! I have never had an issue with this product!!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Blu-ray review, I was surprised how much fun the film would be. Clever script, exciting scenes and funny. Tom Cruise was excellent.<br />A lot of fun, great popcorn movie, beautiful Blu-ray transfer.

0316228532|4.0|I am very, very close to the end so I think it is okay for me to make an accurate review.<br />Like so many others, I had high expectations for this book, for the pure fact that it is J.K. Rowling. Going into this book I really did not want to compare it in anyway to Harry Potter so I had to read it and pretend like I didn't know who the author was.<br />At first I wasn't sure what I thought of the book, but as it progressed I ended up really falling for the characters and feeling the emotional aspects. Some of the characters I love and others I simply despise and that is one of the things that I love about this book and about the way J.K. Rowling writes. She's so vivid when she creates characters you feel like they really exist somewhere.<br />The story line itself I was a bit iffy with and to be honest this normally isn't a book I would ordinarily pick up and read but over all I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I will be anxiously awaiting J.K. Rowling's next book! :)
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie was very colorful and interesting. It had a great little story about trees and how they help a community. Recommend for all ages! Why not!? It's dr. Seuss!
0525953728|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. Thought it was put together quite well. I read it in two days as it was difficult to put down...
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|A classic work that is surprisingly different from the movie we watched as children.  Baum's characters are more human, less good and less bad, than their movie counterparts.  Its a fast and enjoyable read which also sheds some light on the era in which it was written.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Well forth the 20 bux to get caught up with having to buy the season... I had looked on netflix and hulu with no luck so I found it on Amazon and I was able to watch before 5th season.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is written in two different parts. The first is the POV of the husband.<br />And just when you think you've got it all figured out, his wife's story begins.<br />Writing style is average.<br />But the story is engrossing, which is the bottom line.
B008JB9NOG|4.0|i love that smashing pumpkins are re-releasing their older albums and i was VERY happy with the treatment Gish and Siamese Dream got. This one wasnt quite as strong, but still pretty solid. papa likes!
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is the best spider solitaire app I've come across. It is a great time waster.  I highly recommend this for download.
B00933JL0A|2.0|this product has tons of potential, however, it falls short in that it simply does not provide enough in town management.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Got this as a present for my boyfriend for his birthday, he was so excited and bragged to all his co-workers. Makes me feel like the best girlfriend ever.
B00932A2MC|2.0|Despite a few big name stars and special effects the Battlehip sinks to the bottom with all hands on board for me ...only worth watching if you have insomnia ..it might put you to sleep.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel was very different. It kept your attention. Didn't end like I would have thought but it opens it up to a sequel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great site to get wonderful ideas for cooking and decorating. It inspires me to try new things.  It jumpstarts my creative energy.

B008NW67E0|5.0|They've done it again. If you liked the first album then you'll love this one as well. Definitively worth the purchase.
B004RLKV20|5.0|get it ,good down to earth pop rock punk with pure energy and honest lyrics, a must for all green day fans!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I have so looked forward to this no. 2 book, but unfortunately I was dissapointed.  It is so much more a war book, and I have the feeling, that Follett just slides into much well known material.  I would like a better person description and a clearer political analysis.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I have always have been a fan! After watching their live show, I have an even greater appreciation for their talent. What an amazing show and energetic crowd.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Flowers For Algernon is an eye opener for bullys. I found it very uplifting and sad at the same time. People can learn alot about the proper way to treat less fortunate people.
B0099LDUFI|5.0|Love the variety of music that Pink does on this cd.  All of her music goes with the title of the cd.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|You know the end result, but do you know the facts?  No Easy Day takes you on the journey building up to the where abouts of Bin Laden and the mission which brought him down.  The first hand account is not a super hero rendition of the events, rather the facts as they played out.  The author makes no apologizes for his candor and he doesn't need to.  He and his team were trained to do a job and they did it.  This book puts politics aside and tells the story from the ones who lived it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book. My kids have read all three. I also enjoyed the movie. I got the Kindle edition for my iPad. It was a bit difficult to find and download.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|I love this movie, don't know what else to say. It could possible be my fav kids movie ever. Love Danny Divito as Phil, love, love love Hatties.
0743298039|5.0|This book is like several stories woven together - Margaret's story, Vida Winter's story, and the story that Vida tells to Margaret. There was so much to keep track of that I really took my time reading and digesting the book.<br />Before Margaret meets Vida, the reader learns about Margaret's childhood filled with books, growing up in an antique bookstore with a book trader for a father - so many things for a bookworm to envy! Her love of nineteenth century literature seeps through the pages of the book in subtle ways, and I doubt I picked up on all of the hints.<br />Vida draws Margaret into her world through secrets, ghosts, and promises of some greater truth. Margaret is suspicious enough of Vida's story to do her own investigative work into Vida's past, which reveals more secrets and ghosts, as she is also battling with her own personal ghost.<br />The \\"thirteenth tale\\" is the big mystery and hook for Margaret, and very little of the book is predictable, so I was just as surprised by how it all ends as Margaret is. Margaret's dedication to Vida' story and her past goes way beyond that of a simple biographer, and I can't help but root all her varied efforts in tying up all the loose ends before Vida expires.<br />The over-riding theme of the book is the duality of twins, which makes for a very interesting concept and plays into so many sub-plots throughout the book. Without giving it away, uncovering the big revelation is worth the 400-plus page read!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone, not just runners. It deals with the determination of of the human spirit and how we can always dig a bit deeper than we are afraid to do. It will hold your attention from the first to the last page.  I think some people might not read it because they are not runners but you need to read this book!

B00123G6GQ|5.0|Wow I forgot how good this album was! Great groove from Mr. Cobham, one of fusion's pioneers as drummer for Mahavishnu Orchestra.  Jan Hammer, who loves trading jabs with guitarists, is amazing as usual.  This is what jazz fusion is; jazz progressions and groove, rock energy and sounds.  Most songs are in my favorites playlist.
B004OZZ624|4.0|This was a fun entertaining action movie that was worth the time to watch.  No it's not a classic and there may be some holes in the plot but it has a few cute tricks and you will be entertained!
B001CDZZI6|2.0|This book is entirely oriented around the results of the StrengthFinder quiz.  The results, though, only provide one's top 5 strengths.  To obtain the remaining results, one is encouraged (repeatedly) to purchase additional services.  If you have taken Myers-Briggs or similar tests and received coaching on how to leverage those strengths and weaknesses in a team environment, spend your money on something else.  This book, without a doubt, was written as a lead gen product to upsell the $550 consulting services.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Having first read all 7 of the Novels by J. K. Rowling from \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" to \\"The Deathly Hallows\\" BEFORE watching the 8 DVDs, I observed: (1) All 8 movies are highly entertaining and did a good job of following the basic plots of the books; (2) There were several times, especially in the later movies, that excessive special effects, violence, and drama were added to the screenplays taking time and valuable substance from the actual plots: and (3) I was disappointed at the end of \\"Deathly Hallows\\" part 2, that Harry simply throws the elder wand away over the side of the bridge.  It was so nicer in the book when he used the elder wand to properly mend his own wand (which he felt great renewed attachment to), then leave the elder wand in Dumbledore's office where It could do no further harm.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|This is the first book that I've read by Jhumpa Lahiri and will be looking for more by this author.  After being pressured into reading the 50 Shades phenomenon (trash), I needed to read something with substance.  In each story, we meet several characters and get to know them deeply.  Each story made me want to know more . . .  You will not be disappointed.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its similar to tumblr in a way i really like it but it can be slow or close but definitely worthy it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|i have MINECRAFT on my computer but i am also a gamer and a utuber so when in got this i could do a whole new start to my utube channel and i love it
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was impressed by the research from the very beginning. While weaving the life stories of 4 characters & their extended families, from 4 countries involved in the events brought on by World War 1, the writer kept the historical view point moving forward. It may be obvious that this author is opposed to war as he tells of the terrible destruction of lives and properties, but how could anyone not agree that War is a despicable solution to political disagreements.<br />I cannot wait to read the next two books in this series.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|This album is raw an gritty like a Black Keys album should be. The first album I bought was Brothers, liked it so I bought this one and was not disappointed. 'Set you free'is my new favorite song.
B00005K9LN|2.0|If it were based on the music itself, i would give it 5 stars. But when i opened this cd, i noticed something was off. First the title the remasters was not in view as it is on the other remasters CD's. i opened up the Case and Took off the Disk and saw that the Album cover was not printed on the backside just like the other remasters albums. And as i pulled out the Cd, part of the case(the part that holds the disk)came off as well. I tried to fix the case, but it impossible to fix something that was never able to work properly in the first place. I Was willing to put off all of these little problems just as long as i got my music. I put the CD in my computer and what do you know, the names of the songs are all mixed up. I know the order of the set list and I am now wondering what is up with this problem? I have purchased from this seller before and have never had a problem. But now this is putting me off from buying here again. This got me wondering, can this copy be a fake?
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places is gripping, fast moving and well written.  It is very much like a Joyce Carol Oates novel but instead of being about bleak lives in upstate New York, this book is about bleak lives in Kansas.  There is good character development and a dramatic, surprise ending.  A quick read that you won't be able to put down.
B007SGM084|5.0|A must read book!!! I read the trilogy twice in one week because I couldn't get enough of it. It's AWESOME!!!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|i<br />really enjoyed this game because of the way the game was made.. I would trully recommend anyone to purchase this awesome game
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Awesome buy buy buy buy right now, track 4 Just Give Me a Reason is my favorite off it, I'm hoping they start playing it on the radio.
034580404X|3.0|Good story line.  You definitely kept turning the page..But a warning to anyone who is not interested in BDSM, it will shock you and for those who read erotica....its a descriptive story but not as descriptive as some out there....<br />It gets a little dry and predictable by the middle of book 2,  but picks up again in book 3.  If you started reading it, you will definitely finish all 3 books just to read how it all plays out.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Since I watched this movie, I've been waiting for the DVD! I've bought the soundtrack and listen to the songs very often. All the songs and actors are great one the movie. I love all of them!<br /><br />Some people may say the story is fragile, but I think it is awesome as a musical movie. There are many funny and memorable clips I really want to have an aftertaste. Actually I really want to watch it again on the cinema if it has not been taken down.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Really, really liked it. The new Spok character is even better than the original one, if you can believe it. Quinto is really superb.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Too long, too much bragging about personal machismo in bar fights, etc. found myself scanning rather than reading.  Appreciate his service, just poorly presented.
B009329Y30|4.0|The movie didn't follow the book very closely but it was pretty good for a love story. Its the kind of movie that would make the regular guy feel incompetent so I wouldn't watch this with my hubby...he hates \\"chick flicks.\\"
B0087HT36U|5.0|Whole family likes this game. Found a couple of glitches on the Fire, but the HD version for iPad had no problems. Looking forward to the updates
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Only half way through but it seems to be 2 or 3 because too much extraneous dialogue about childhood in AK etc.  the Somalia pirate  and OBL incursions should be more of the focus. Ienjoyed the training excerpt also, but they were too extensive also.  Book spent too much time on topics other than the focus of the book.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|The acting was first class. The storyline was sick. Lord of the Flies was a much better, and more realistic movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is now on my author must read list. Bared to You and Reflected in You  gripped me from the first pages. Eva and Gideon drag you down deep. Can't wait for the third!! December can't come soon enough!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This third book in the series was my favorite of the three, but I thought it was just a lot of repetition of the same things.  I should have borrowed the books instead of buying them.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I wish I could say that this is the ultimate media player for Android.  Many of the reviews here appear to be  from Kindle Fire users, to whom this may indeed be the be-all and end-all player.  The Fire is only one of my devices, so I have tried many things to find the Holy Grail.<br /><br />What's nice about aVia Media Player is that it's easy-to-use and does a good job for most people.  It also keeps getting better every time I take another look.<br /><br />For my needs, VPlayer Pro is a better option, because it does both hardware and software decoding.  Why is this better? It doesn't limit you to just the formats built into your chipset.  So, the people who had to do pre-converting on their PC won't be forced to do that.<br /><br />Here's a short list of video software I like for Android:<br /><br />VPlayer Pro<br />Skifta<br />aVia Media Player<br />XBMC<br />Orb Media player<br /><br />and another half-dozen I only use from time to time.<br /><br />Sounds like a lot?  Well, sadly, none of them do everything and some excel in one place where the other excels elsewhere.<br /><br />The moral of the story is not to rely on what I say (or anyone else), but do try things out to see what's best for your own situation.<br /><br />aVia is a good place to start.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Always know how much time is left on all forms of usage.  Never lose a download due to insufficient time.  Quick and easy.
B0098VXE50|3.0|Pretty weak performance from Kristen Stewart - seems like she was just playing Bella in another movie.  The special effects weren't bad, overall if it were a free movie, it is worth watching, but I would spend my money on it again.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Must read for teenagers and everyone else.  I love having tons of scientific explanations about the natural world in one short collection while at the same time exposing the myths of religious cults.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|I thought this movie would be more funny than it was based off of the trailer.  It was still a good watch, but glad I waited for the video/dvd.  Decent overall, but the characters were predictable.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I like to use this app to download YouTube videos while on Wi-Fi so that I can watch them on my commute where no signal is available underground. This main function is probably the best use of the app as I would not recommend it for casual browsing of YouTube videos. While fairly easy to download videos from any other app or web, the interface is a little clunky getting to the saved videos. Fix the constant crashing that's been happening lately, I give a four star rating. Improve that interface, five stars for sure.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|Well, I don't want to speak of these films as a lot, so I'm going to review each one individually.<br />Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery. This movie is the introductory film, the one in which we meet Austin Powers and Doctor Evil, two people (ironically, both played by Mike Meyers) who have been frozen in the 60's to be defrosted in the 90's. It's a funny movie with hilariously rude sexual remarks. Even the names in this film seem a little off (Allotta Fagina, for example). These movies are kings of crudeness, yet they are hilarious. The menacing Dr. Evil is trying to stop British spy Austin Powers from destroying him. To top it off, Doctor Evil is introduced as an idiot that can't handle tying his shoes without getting ruined by Austin Powers. It is a hilarious movie, and left a good taste in my mouth after I seen it. 5 out of 5 stars.<br />Austin Powers. The Spy Who Shagged Me. This middle movie (well, it's the middle at the time of this writing, but hopefully by the time you read this, there will be another new 2012 Austin Powers movie on the way) picks up right where the first one left off. Austin is married, and he has banished Doctor Evil to space. However, Doctor Evil gets de thawed to be on a Jerry Springer show titled \\"My Father Is Evil And Wants To Take Over The World,\\" where he is with his son, Scott Evil (when Doctor Evil was frozen, he had semen frozen as well, and they made a son, in the event Doctor Evil never returned). We also meet Dr. Evil's exact clone, like him in every way... except 1/8 his size! Another addition is \\"Fat Bastard\\" (played by... YOU GUESSED IT! Mike Meyers) who travels 2 years after Austin was frozen to steal his mojo! This movie continues the inappropriate names (Ivanna Humpalot, to name one), and feature many rude humorous moments... nobody who's seen the movie will ever forget the opening segment in which Austin Powers is running through a hotel COMPLETELY NAKED! This movie is unique to me, moreover than the first movie, because it seems to have more in it. A lot more happens, and there is more happening in a shorter time (not to mention ditzy Doctor Evil making a \\"laser,\\" and going to unleash \\"The Alan Parson's Project\\" on the United States of America. It is up to Austin Powers to stop him in this hilarious sequel! 5 out of 5 stars.<br />Austin Powers: Goldmember. Sequel to Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember begins what seems like a long time after SWSM (AP2) ended. However, Austin is back, and again travels to the future, where a Dutch gold enthusiast has kidnapped his father. Austin must travel back through time to get his father back! We discover that there is a bad relationship between Austin and his father, and Goldmember (GUESS WHAT?? Played my MIKE MEYERS, as these must be EXTREMELY low-budgeted films) is working for Doctor Evil, who is (AGAIN!) back! We find something frightening about Austin and Doctor Evil (Duggie) by the end of the film! It ends up being a very touchy family film! The crude humor still continues (and the NAMES again: Fook Mi and Fook Yu), and there is an appearance from Ozzie Ozbourne! It's really the weakest of the series, but the fact that it is Austin Powers and in the hands of Mike Meyers makes it an awesome film! 5 out of 5 stars.<br />If you have some spare change (or are a big spender) be sure to get an Amazon gift card (or fire up your credit card) for Austin Powers I-III on DVD!<br />**NOTE! I don't have this on DVD, I have all 3 on original release VHS!**
B003O86FMW|4.0|the kind of book you could pick up at anytime and be constantly entertained. Fun series. The first book is definetly the best! Although they are all good.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I'm not a fan of cheesy campy films with alot of makeup which alot of people make this out to be but you have to admit it's an art to making a film that is just that, but still entertains and Burton always delivers on that note. Another thing that's in all his films is an all-star cast, alot of people don't know Eva Green but she really is a great actress who hasn't seen any great roles just yet. If you rented a burton film expecting anything other than quirky you probably have no place reviewing this title anyways. I wouldn't buy this movie, but that's true of 90% of films i've seen.....bottom line, this movie delivers exactly what it's supposed to and if you wanted to see an action film by ridley scott you should go watch that instead of rating this when you don't even like the genre. If you like this genre or director you will probably like the movie, the one-liners were perfectly placed for a comedy and the entire cast had time to shine. Eva Green is HOT !
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Anxiously I have awaited the second book in this Triology and it has not disappointed!!  Anyone that is a fan of Ken Follett's novels will  be entranced and as spellbound as with the first!  I highly recommend  \\"The Winter of the World!\\"
B008I34YYY|5.0|This is one of the best B movies that I've seen in quite some time!  My rather reluctant wife even enjoyed it.
0061122416|1.0|According to Wikipedia, this book (first published in 1988 in Portuguese), has sold more than 65 million copies in 160 countries, and became one of the best-sellers in history; it entered the Guinness Book of Records as the most translated book by a living author (in 71 languages, as of 2011); it seems that even Bill Clinton, Madonna, and Julia Roberts read and raved about it!!  Let me add one more record the book has broken: it is the most overrated novel in history!!!  However, to be fair to Coelho, he honestly and admirably admits in the introduction that to the question why his book is so successful, his answer is: \\"I don't know!\\"<br />The book, at least the English translation by Alan Clarke, is written in an extremely common, utterly unsophisticated, and uniquely uninteresting style, worse than that of a children book for 10- year olds. It is full of boring clich&eacute;s and surprisingly common expressions (Santiago, the main protagonist, looks for a `job' (not the generic `work'); he addresses an old Arab/Egyptian woman as `ma'am' (not `mother' or `grandmother' as she would be addressed in Arab culture!!!). Its main subject is rather undistinguished and hardly novel: the quest of a young man to realize his dream. While the book is often described as `allegorical' (implying: sophisticated), I find it quite bland and simplistic.<br />Instead of inventing a mysterious and unknown world at an unspecified time, to achieve universality, stir the imagination, and especially to avoid constraints and pitfalls of specific time and space, Coelho, most surprisingly, chose to use real parts of the Mediterranean at a (more-or-less!!), known period. It is supposed to take place 'somewhere in the past'. However, Coelho does not give details. This point is important for accuracy and credibility.<br />Let me explain.<br />Santiago - whose name, by the way, is only given once in the very first sentence of the novel, but is referred to hence-foreword, for no apparent reason, as \\"the boy\\", though obviously, he is not a `boy' but a young man!! - is a shepherd in Andalusia, who has instantly fallen in love with a 'Moorish eyed, raven-black-haired (understand Arab), girl'.  But the impression given is that the author is talking about Spain under catholic control; however, since Arabs were banished from Spain in 1492, we should assume that the story happens before that year, let's say around 1450!!  Nevertheless, our nice shepherd is `trading' books at will while roaming the countryside, which means there were bookstores/sellers  all-around; he encounters an 'Englishman' who has a 'carry-on library' of many books on alchemy. As we remember, Guttenberg invented his pressing technique only around 1450; and for a long time the printed books printed were only religious. This means that 'normal' printed books (let alone on alchemy!!), could not possibly be available neither to Santiago, nor to the Englishman around 1450!!!<br />Now, for geography.<br />The Caravan that both Santiago and the Englishman took had to cross several thousands of miles/kilometers through what now are Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya; as well as the vast Egyptian west desert, before arriving at Al-Fayoum oasis. Nevertheless, the caravan seems somehow to have made that distance very quickly, it seems just in few days, and never encountered anyone or anything but the desert and few black-clad Bedouins (seemingly, avoiding - on purpose? - the most evidently better route of the costs, where there are cities with water, food, and people!!). We are told the caravan travelers were \\"two hundred people ... women, children, and a number of men\\"!! Why on earth all these people were going from Tangiers to Al-Fayoum, or even Egypt, for that matter?? Caravans consisted mainly of men trading various goods; no women or children took part in caravans traveling thousands of miles!! Then, after arriving in Al-Fayoum, which is about 100 kilometers from the Pyramids, Santiago and the Alchemist took over one month to reach the Pyramids (when 2 days would have been more than enough!).<br />Now for the characters.<br />Santiago, from a nice, naïve young man, who falls in love in seconds each time he meets an Arab girl!!, becomes all of a sudden a very wise, eloquent, and learned \\"boy\\", who speaks philosophically pearls of wisdom.  In fact, at one point, not only him but all the characters were pouring their learned knowledge and covering us up with their precious wisdom: the glass merchant, the Englishman, the camel driver, Fatima, the chieftains, and of course, the Alchemist! All of them spoke the same words: Personal Legend; Language of the World; the soul of the World, Maktub (written destiny), etc. I was bored to death while reading over and over the same meaningless words. For instance, often, in one single page, you could read the words \\"Personal Legend\\" at least a dozen times!!! We are repeatedly told that if you seek to realize your \\"Personal Legend\\", \\"all the universe conspires in helping you\\"!! What nonsense is this??<br />All this happens within a hodge-podge of confused and confusing cross relations between countries, religions, philosophies, and cultures, with no clear, useful, or meaningful outcome in sight!!!<br />I went into this review with some length and detail, because if the book had reached such a level of popularity, I felt it necessary to explain why I thought it is such a greatly overrated novel of very little significance.ook over one month to reach the Pyramids (when 2 days would have been more than enough!).<br />Now for the characters.<br />Santiago, from a nice, naïve young man, who falls in love in seconds each time he meets an Arab girl!!, becomes all of a sudden a very wise, eloquent, and learned \\"boy\\", who speaks philosophically pearls of wisdom.

B00932A2MC|3.0|Really 2 and 1/2 stars but I have it a bit of extra credit.  Enjoyable and entertaining with lots of funny bits thrown in.  Special effects were good. It was diverting.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote on all my devices and love it!  I make shopping lists everywhere and always have them with me.
B004O9G9YE|5.0|This product is presented exactly as it is when you receive it. The quality of this product is excellent, the packaging and the promptness in which I received it was really remarkable. Fantastic service!
B003SNKBXW|3.0|Sometimes I like it when the author plays with my head, but this one irritated me a bit. I also hate the idea of old rare volumes needlessly being destroyed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love the show, love the game!  The steam levels really change it up!<br /><br />And who can forget Balloony!  Those levels are awesome as well.
B00932A2MC|2.0|It took 6 hours to download this movie to my TiVo. I couldnt watch it when I wanted to and the movie had an amateurish plot. The alien spaceships are some combination of snake and alligator that jump through water like a dog trying to swim.
0316228532|1.0|After having read and re-read all the Harry Potter novels, I was eagerly awaiting Rowling's first book for adults.  I expected a well written novel, with characters I cared about, deep themes, food for thought, and a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Rowling can write, but her insistence on attempting to phonetically capture the dialect of the \\"lower class\\" was very distracting.  I had to pause and try to figure out what was being being said, and that kept me from engaging with those characters.<br /><br />While humans all have fatal flaws, Rowling's focus on ONLY the flaws in every character kept me from caring about anyone - as death and misfortune rained down in the town of Pagford, I felt nothing except \\"when will she get to the point?\\"<br /><br />The themes were very superficial:Rich people don't want to associate with poor people...The poor and disadvantaged are good at heart, the well off are evil...Most people are only concerned with themselves...We don't appreciate someone until they're gone.  All very trite.<br /><br />The conclusion could have been predicted from about page 50 of the book.  No one is redeemed.<br /><br />I can't believe I wasted $20 - and the time I spent reading it - on this book.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This book develops very slowly and then sort of peters out at the end. Jack Reacher is still a great character but this book is not up to Lee Child's other books. A disappointment.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I LOVE Pinterest and have been waiting forger for this app.  Everytime I open the app it freezes and has to force close.  When I try to pin something from a website it freezes and I have to turn off my kindle.  The new app for my Droid 4 works perfectly.....very frustrating on the kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could never have picked a better ending for the trio of fantastically entertaining books.  The characters drove the plot line in a way that was un expected yet perfect.  Well done Collins....well done
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I think this book is a true \\"day in the life\\" story of a Navy Seal.  It kept my interest to the last chapter.  This was one of the greatest mission in this conflict and it was carried out by the Seals.  That made me proud.  They did not do it for fame or glory, they did it because it was their job and some with the oltimate sacrifice.  I am glad Mark told his story and I understand that he did not and could not give us reader the entire story and I understand that.  I still totally enjoyed it.<br /><br />Being ex-Navy myself made this even more iteresting.  I was in the Navy SeaBees in Viet Nam.  I got the biggest kick when Mark mentioned in the final chapters the SeaBees that supported his team.  Thanks Mark.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This toy was a gift for my nephew. He loved it. It has endless ways to set the game. With this toy kids are playing, having fun and using their creativity skills.I reccommend this toy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is enjoyable! wish the coins generate faster but overall very fun! it takes time to get the prizes but it makes it a challange.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|I have watched this video at least 3 times since we purchased it. It is one I find worthwhile viewing again and again. I feel it can also be a tool for our children and grandchildren to teach them patience and to know that there are good things worth waiting for and not using up all of our resources without \\"planting\\" new ones. Great video!!
0439023521|5.0|Okay, I saw the cover, not so eye-catching.  It is not until later when I kept seeing the reviews for the Hunger Games, when I should put aside my materialistic view, and just take a crack at the book preview.  I was instantly sucked into the story.<br /><br />I bought the whole trilogy.  Book 1, Hunger Games was very different from other books I have read.  It was rough, with all the competition and blood being spilled for only 1 winner should remain.  However, the description of Katniss' costumes, love story, and courageous personality, made the book all the more, worthwhile and fun.<br /><br />**book bought last year 2011**
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Interesting plot. Enjoyed the graphics and searching for objects very much. Can't wait for continuation.<br />Hidden objects were well done.
0312641893|5.0|I was a bit hesitant about reading a book that had futuristic kind of feel to story.  But after reading many reviews without too many spoilers, I made a quick decision to buy the book.  Fairytale Cinderella-ish story, yes, click to add-to-cart, one book bought immediately please.<br /><br />After reading the book, I was immediately hooked!  I loved how Marissa portrayed Cinder in the story.  She was independent and courageous. There was an interesting development between her and the Prince.  Later on, the story hints itself that Cinder may be someone that some people have been looking for.  It was very exciting to read how the story unfolded and I cannot wait for the next book!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Ok movie youfor a Friday night popcorn and a movie night.  This is one you will have to decide for yourself.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I have enjoyed the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey.  The second book, it got more rough with the sexual activities involved, Ana versus Christian with their love-hate relationship, and so forth.<br /><br />But like other readers and reviews out there, I cannot stop reading the book.  Although, it did take me a little while longer to finish the second book.
B0086700CM|5.0|sadly I could not buy the game cause I forgot my password. but!!!! I did play this awesome game before though. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! I wish I had gotten this game. but I will get it!! I SWEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:O
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the first book, the second book was good, the third book, same old, same old sexual activities.  By the third book, it took me a couple of days to read the book.  Do not get me wrong, I like E.L. James' characters of Christian and Ana and how they are portrayed.  When I have read the first two books and their sexual conquest, it gets repetitive and I know that every other three or so pages with include another love making scenes.<br /><br />I liked how the story ended.  I always love a good happy ending to a trilogy!
B007TML4EI|5.0|I play almost every day, and being a college student studying to be an engineer, the physics and structural design really fascinate me. Awesome!
B007TMON8M|4.0|This is a cute little app that asks you to design things under budget and with some restraints.  Some of them are harder than you'd suspect at first glance. My only complaint would be that it doesn't always anchor when you think you've added one.  I like playing with it and experimenting with structures.
B000WFBC6E|3.0|The Mondaine wall clock is attractive, somewhat sturdy feeling and basically true to the look of the ubiquitous clocks in Swiss railway stations - - a very appealing and nostalgic evocation for those with pleasant memories of Swiss train trips.  Having had it a month, it also seems to be accurate.  The fairly high price reflects the brand name and design, not particularly the overall quality, which is decent but not overwhelming.  The metal case is nice, but is \\"Made in China.\\"  The small plastic-encased movement is advertised on Amazon as \\"Swiss,\\" but it is not - - a serious misrepresentation for a timepiece.  Rather, it is \\"Made in Germany\\"  - - at least not China.  The second hand would be truer-to-the-original if it didn't jerk between the seconds with the red disk shaking a bit at each tick.  So, I like the look a lot but don't think its quality really measures up to the implied image.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|My teens play this game allot! they love it. I play it on and off I also enjoy it. It really makes you think sometimes. It is entertaining!
B000001EL3|5.0|From start to finish, this KISS classic is the stuff! Detroit Rock City, King Of The Night Time World, God Of Thunder, Shout It Out Loud, Do You Love Me, Beth, Flaming Youth/etc..Nothing else more to say except \\"DESTROYER\\"  - A definite defining hard & heavy classic rock gem for all rockers!
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|It's ok u only get one character and one course without paying I probably wouldn't buy it I don't like it
B004LWZWGA|4.0|i loved almost every character in this movie that what was not named Batman. It is really hard to not like Tom Hardy's performance as Bane, he nails it. Joseph Levitt is a great addition for being the new original character he is very helpful compared to Rachel which she really got on my nerves because she only created problems and didn't help out. Gary Oldman is great again as Gordon along with Michael Caine as Alfraid and everyone loves Morgan Freeman as Fox. Anne Halthway blew me away as far as Catwoman goes i was very iffy on her but when i saw the previews and heard she was going to play her but she is great.<br /><br />The story i thought was decent for being a taking a combination of ideas and throwing them in a blender.<br /><br />only problem i have with this movie is Bruce Wayne/Batman i feel like he is the most uninteresting character of the movie he quits for 8 years and not once do we see him looking back on why he became batman in the first place his parents death or the fact is he doesn't want the same thing happening to anybody else that happen to him as a child but what does he say to Alfraid how dare you mention Rachel's name like that really.<br /><br />so that's what i thought overall see it for the supporting cast.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Its really not anything that requires a lot of skill, but still very enjoyable to play.  my six year old loves to play and watch me play.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is awesome. If you love puzzles but do not have the space this app is for you. You can choose the picture you want and even the number of puzzle pieces. You can also choose whether you want the edge pieces only. I love this app, it is perfect for relaxing after a hard day.
B006LSZECO|4.0|certainly left me looking for a sequel.  I liked the way the author kept me in suspense as to what was happening
B007GCY8FS|4.0|So nice to have jack reacher back.  No romance and limited hand to hand combat but refreshing to have jack back none the less.
B0063GORYU|3.0|This version of the spider solitaire game is pretty good.  Sometimes the rows of cards get 'stuck' and you can't move them.  I also find it harder to see what moves I have - the graphics on the card are very busy - compared to the pc version of spider.<br />not a bad game though, and it's a free app.  And there are other game options within it that I haven't tried yet.
B00992CF6W|4.0|So cool but I want them to upgrade out of alpha I already have the computer game but I'm just saying get out of alpha
B003O86FMW|5.0|[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]] Collins continues with the edge of your seat story. Difficult to put down. I wanted to devour it in one sitting.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I loved this book. Definitely will be one of those that I read again and again and will learn something new each time.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Once again Dylan has released a  beautiful wide-ranging oral history of our times.  Sometimes funny, sometimes sad but always a pleasure to listen to.  Tempest contains one of the best 3-song arcs of any Dylan album beginning with the American west neo-gothic murder ballad Tin Angel, continuing to the title track, his epic 13 minute stream-of-conscious retelling of the Titanic disaster, and finishing the album with Roll On, John; his rememberance of his friend John Lennon.<br /><br />The album is a bit more more up-tempo than Time Out of Mind but less peppy than Love and Theft and with a greater range of song styles than Modern Times.  I can't say if it's better or worse than any of his last few masterpieces but the album certainly holds its own with them and adds to Dylan's contribution as America's rambling bard-in-chief.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game and it entertains my little brother who is 3. I don't find the ads too intrusive either. overall It deserves a solid 4 stars.
1603427244|5.0|Great resource for any project. You can find some of this info on Youtube but this book organizes and describes the stitches so you can pick out just the right one for your project and even pick out matching cast-on and cast-off edges.
0525953728|5.0|Great book...these guys are the best there is and it shows...I love the SEALS work ethic and constant training...thanks for your efforts and God Bless You All
B000FC0V3E|4.0|This is a great place to begin reading Hemingway's works.  What an extraordinary author!  I started reading Hemingway with 'For Whom the Bell Toles', which is also an exceptional piece of work.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is a good story; it is funny, exciting and sometimes sad. Her characters are flawed - which makes them human. Even the most perfect looking human (I.e. Grey) is flawed. She could have made him a god, but she does not. A very enjoyable read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day was a very interesting read.  Even though you knew the final outcome, the author held your attention. It is the type of book that you don't want to put down.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Child will always be one of my favorite authors, and I am deeply in love with Reacher. That said, this is the weakest book I have read from him. I wasn't compelled like I usually am with his work to read the entire book without putting it down.<br />The plot was ok. The characters were so monotonous I had to flip back to remember which one was which. All in all a good book, but no one will be calling it Child's best.
B008YI91HS|4.0|Great special effects for its time.  The Dinosaurs look real.  And they used Dr Jack Horner's paleontological expertise to craft some realistic dinosaurs and give them natural behavior.<br /><br />We just watched it again with my kids and the dinosaurs looked just as good as current movies.  And the T Rex and the Velociraptors scared us all just like they did the first time.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This book is dark from front to back.  I found this book extremely depressing with the hope that the main character would be happy by the end of the book. Didn't happen.  It just sort of ended in sad and confusing way.  I would not recommend this book.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have reaed all of Lee Childs books regarding Jack Reaacher and find them all most interesting and easy to read..I would and have recommended the Jack Reacher books to my friends..THis book has many interesting twists in its plot..I hope Lee Childs keeps up the good work..Ray Rask
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I don't usually go for vampires, but witches fascinate me.  This is a great combination of the two. I couldn't put it down.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Purchased this for my Google Nexus 7 tablet.  It works just great.  Shows a graph of<br />the available wifi spots so you can see which is strongest.  Works just fine with the<br />Nexus 7 tablet.
B00846REIS|2.0|Sorry to say, but this book was like re-reading Fifty Shades of Gray (which I loved, actually).  The names were different, but there was little else to distinguish it from its predecessor.  In places the story lines were so similar I had to check and see which book I had in my hand!  Felt like the author was trying to capitalize on someone else's success.  If you haven't read Fifty Shades, and you like racy romance novels, you'll probably like it, but I felt cheated myself.
B00499K9E0|4.0|Well done, well written, just a bit hard to understand the character's strong british accents-- even quite true to the story from which it was derived-- A study in Red.<br /><br />Season 2, Eapisode 1 on the other hand was distateful, tawdry, and I wish we hadn't rented it-- I don't like getting asaulted unsuspectingly by pornography.  We ended up not watching this episode very long into it.  Wish we had had a warning as to content.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A typical \\"Reacher\\" book.  He's one tough guy and it shows again in this book.  Can't wait to read the next one...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am used to using a date calender for all my notes and to do lists.  Evernote keeps everything on all me devices and I don't have to carry a big calender book around.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Im so excited that this game finally came out on true kindle!!! Ive played it sooo many times on my cousins phone
0525953728|5.0|Ordering the book and its delivery were the ususal Amazon experience of speed and efficiency.  The book itself was and excellent read and was full of factual, well presented events leading up to the demise of Osama Bin Laden.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|This author has a great storytelling style and has created an interesting world. I definitely recommend this book to fiction fans who are looking for a good read.
B0080N6AVC|5.0|This series is so well written with great acting, The story line is entertaining even though you may never believe this stuff.  I was hooked and watched all 7 seasons withing a few months, !
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the download from 4 shared.com. Sadly I do not have the 4.0 update yet. Do you? please respond!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enjoyed the story, enjoyed the puzzles &amp; putting together the clues to solve other puzzles. Nice graphics. There was a hint option if you needed it. I am looking forward to more games. Big Fish games are relaxing &amp; entertaining.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I wish I had bought the series all together. I could not put the 1st book down and it was a better buy to get the trilogy. I don't usually read fiction but the book does have a good story and I was intrigued by the character, Christian. I found it an easy read. I had heard from a lot of people before I bought the book how good it was, but it was a husband who said to me \\"I love that my wife has read the books, what it has done for our relationship! It is the best book that was ever written!!\\" His comment is what made me read the books to see what has made a difference in his life...not like a man to be greatful for a fictional book. All my female friends got excited reading it. Very raunchy but thats not what kept me reading, I really liked the characters.
1455502758|5.0|Marx wrote in \\"Herr Vogt\\" that, \\"There is only one antidote to mental suffering and that is physical pain.\\"  He was wrong.  For Hitchens, the antidote to both was writing and debating.  While cancer took his voice, \\"Mortality\\" proves it did not take his mind.<br /><br />Doubtlessly or \\"arguably\\", Hitchens in one of his guises,  the \\"public intellectual\\", acerbic commentator, former Trotskyist (and later on, presumed \\"neo-conservative\\") is known to the general public as a \\"militant\\" atheist.  This is an unfortunately unidimensional characterization, given the depth and breadth of his personality and perspectives. Paraphrasing Bob Dylan, who acerbically noted that no man's legacy will be determined by the depth of his public acclaim, Hitchens' legacy will probably be determined by his Hazlett-like polemics, redolent as they are of genuine Enlightenment values.  Hitchens' \\"salon\\" featuring a panoply of literary and cultural greats lives on in \\"Mortality\\", as does the author's incisive intellect, barbed analysis and well-crafted sentences.<br /><br />Despite the onslaught of demeaning and patronizing medical and pseudo-medical practitioners; banalities fluxing up from various well-wishers (and vitriol from his many critics); the emotionally, physically and cognitively draining therapy; the ever-distracting milieu; and, above all, the certainty of an unpleasant death in the near-term future, Hitchens labors on. For those looking for death-bed repudiation of atheism: forget it.  For those searching for profound philosophical insights into the \\"stages\\" of death and dying, look elsewhere.  Searching for platitudes, homilies, bromides, and vacuities on death?  Nope.  Hitchens, the master of the feuilletons does not disappoint other than for his absence from the stage. To paraphrase Tucholsky, in this case, the death of one man is indeed a tragedy...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose this rating because i thought the book was really great and that alot  of people may be able to relate
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Defiantly a crier! A must see. I remember watching this on the news. A great \\"feel good\\" movie. Got to buy this one.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|I discovered Caro Emerald a while ago. She has this lovely, throaty voice quality and tone that I love. And her songs have a great swingy feel to them. This album is certainly a must. A few of the tracks are not as strong as the others, but for the most part, it's a great listen.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I played through this with only needing one of the super bombs. A lot like angry birds but the graphics are cute and I like the saving hostages part.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|2 broke girls is hilarious. If you like vulgar humor this it the show for you. Its funny and at times its touching. They have really put together a wonderful group of people to bring out the best in this show! Highly recommend.
B00633W614|4.0|The two books are very good but I was so disappointed that the third book won't come out until next year.  When you start reading a trilogy you expect that all three books will be available.  Now, when I will read the third book, I will have forgotten lots of what happened in the first two.
0345803485|1.0|Really?Dominant powerful hot billionaire keeps gasping trough the book because stupid girl bites her lip all the time? And all she has to say is:\\" Oh my!\\" ? Isn't she supposed to be 21? I never heard anyone under 60 saying that ))) And the worst part is all that dancing inner goddess and Ana's subconscious waging her finger or passing out bs.I roll my eyes)))<br /> I find annoying the fact author subscribes to clich&eacute; oxymoronic ideas that every guy wants a virgin whore,and all women are looking for a sensitive bad boy.<br />All in all I find dialog and story really boring.Sex part is OK, but to my surprise quite vanilla romantic for book about BDSM ,and anyway if that's what you want-stuff like that is easy to find online for free, without having to get trough hundreds of boring badly written pages.If you want well written captivating story to read,with some sex it, get \\"Game of thrones\\".<br /> I find myself puzzled by overwhelming success of this book, and ooh so unreasonably jealous of insane amount of money E L James raked up for this.<br />  And it will be made into a movie ((( Well... unless they make it full blown porn, no pun intended,or hire some genius to rewrite the dialog, it will be horrid. And guess what, it will make as much money as \\"Twilight\\", another phenomena I can not understand .
B007FEFLTO|3.0|After waiting for the release of this book with great expectations,  I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed.  I had missed Leon Uris' \\"Armageddon a Story of Berlin\\" when it was published and have just recently read it.  I felt that I was re-reading the same book in the last part of Follet's book.  Also I thought I would be reading, and was looking forward to,  more of the history of the twentieth century.  Instead, \\"Winter of the World\\" turns out to be just another world war 2 novel.  Follet is always a good read but I expecterd more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the website is great. the only bad thing about this app is sometimes it freezes and you have to force close and reopen but that is only sometimes. otherwise it great
B007THA4FI|3.0|Expectations for Rowling are enormously high.  If this book had been written Maeve Binchy, we wouldn't be as stingy with praise.  But this book is written by JK Rowling, the Literary Queen of England.  I am a huge fan so I grabbed this book via Kindle download as soon as it was available.  It's taken me nearly two weeks to finish it.  The storyline is slow to develop and the characters are not very engaging.  There are some definite plot twists at the end and some compelling moments, but overall it's just a slow read and an \\"okay\\" novel.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child is always a must-read for me!  The Reacher series is always action-packed, but still an intelligent read.  Top-notch novelist, top-notch hero!!!  This is a great addition to the series!

B005KIR1IG|5.0|I bought this Lego set at Amazon.Com for my granddaughter back in August, 2012, but only recently sent it to her in Canada.  Our granddaughter likes the set and plays with it each day for a period of time. My daughter did not count out all the pieces when she opened the set, and now finds somehow there is no little elephant with this particular set.  Other than this little disappointment, the set is wonderfully entertaining and keeps our granddaughter busy for an hour or more at a time.  She is quite possessive of it and doesn't want her parents to mess with it until she is ready to put it away in its box.  Its a great set, but my advice to any buyers is you had better make sure to count out all the pieces and make sure it is all there.

It's definitely different than I was expecting based on the last Yes album, but it has some of the Behavior album feel to it (which is one of my favorite albums by them). Really enjoying it...great album!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it was exactly the amount of brain power I was willing to waste.  so simply but oddly addicting.  highly recommend if keeping on mind whet this game is meant to be.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love this trilogy!  Can't wait for the third book.  I expect to see the series turned into a movie soon.  I really like TV series even better for Follett's \\"big\\" books, as they last longer and can be closer to the books . . . don't have to take so much out so they can fit into 2 hr movie.  Somebody please make a series of these books?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!  there wasn't any dull moments and it was just a new adventure page after page. definitely a must read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is great to get because if u are going to Dutch and u forgot your Bible u have an extra
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you are a fan of the Alien movie lore, this is a must own. It has all four movies looking great in HD.<br />You will not be disappointed.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Read most of Lee Child's books and this is one of the best.<br />Cannot see Tom Cruze playing Jack Reacher however I am looking<br />forward to any Lee Child\\"s books becoming movies.
030758836X|1.0|My book club chose this book and I dutifully ordered it on my Kindle. Read it on a road trip and must say it just may be the worst piece of fiction I've ever read. Horrible, non-ending, total waste of time and money!! My one consolation is at least it was only hours in the car wasted.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was one of the most boring books I have ever read.  I heard so many good things about the book and I kept waiting for it to get better.  Then I was finished the book.  Now, I'm left with the impression that you must have to read all three books for it to be interesting.  Maybe Book 2 is better, but I refuse to waste any more time or money on this Snooze Fest.  As far as erotica goes, it was nothing new.  It's been done before by Zane, as well as other authors.
B000006TRV|4.0|The Wall by Pink Floyd is my ever first album by them, and I became a fan. Even though I'm 21, I really enjoy listening to classic rock, and my other favorite band is Led Zeppelin (but that's another story and band).  The Wall is their second best selling album, Dark Side of the Moon first, and Wish You Were Here third. At the time I was listening to Pink Floyd's Wall album (more like Roger Water's album, but The Final Cut is pure Waters), I began searching both Pink Floyd's history and The Wall itself. I discovered that this album actually tells a story line, and it strongly ties with The Wall. Roger Waters, a very good song writer, indeed, but became such an a-hole toward the other members, tell his story as well as the band themselves. Roger begins the story with a young boy growing up with out a father and an over protective mother. This part is very true, since it really deals with Roger's past. He really did grew up fatherless. His dad, Eric Fletcher Waters, died while serving World War II. Then the story goes on how the boy--whose name is Pink Floyd--became a big rock star, like the band themselves. Then of course Pinkie (our protagonist in the story) falls away with drugs. This part here deals with a real experience. Pink Floyd's original founder and singer, Syd Barrett, took LSD in the late sixties and became a much more different man, and he was replaced by David Gilmour. The Roger's story becomes really weird. He then decides to deliver the point of view in Pinkie's mind. This is where the album focus on what Pinkie truly sees in his eyes. This part here is where he imagines he's not a singer at all but a Nazi like leader, since this is very strongly influenced by World War II, because Waters' dad was killed by the Nazis. He--Pinkie--tries to break out of this \\"Wall.\\" And that's where the album ends. To see the whole story in much more detail, watch the movie, which I'm actually glad that Roger wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />Now that you got the story down, and some Pink Floyd's history, The Wall was first of its kind, since it actually deals with a storyline and deals with much more darker mood. However, some songs are really good to stand by themselves, while you're not really thinking about the story at all. \\"In the Flesh?\\" really kicks off the album in high gear. This seems to sum up what's coming in the album. I wish I could go more detail in every track, but I'm really doing the ones that I love from this album. \\"Another Brick in the Wall part 1\\" deals with Roger telling a photograph of his father. \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives,\\" is an opener for \\"Another Brick in the Wall, part 2.\\" These two tracks are about mean school teachers. \\"Mother\\" is a nice and slower paste track. This part is about Roger's over protected mother. And I like David Gilmour singing the two parts in this song, as in the point of view of mother herself. \\"Young Lust\\" is David Gilmour's type of music. The song is about Pinkie traveling around, and getting laid. \\"Another Brick in the Wall, part 3\\" is a lot shorter, but more heavier than the first two parts. I wish the band could have made the song a lot longer, because the lyrics are good and the music is a lot more heavier. \\"Hey You\\" is an eerie track that David Gilmour sings first half of the song. It's about Pinkie trying reaching out, but not getting help at all. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is the song that most Pink Floyd fans love. It's a dark song with a nice balance of lightness in the chorus. This is where Pinkie becomes so drug up that he imagines himself as a Nazi like leader. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is almost like the pervious song, but much more shorter and David sings much more faster. I do wish the band could have made this song a lit longer, but its still enjoyable. \\"Run Like Hell\\" puts the songs on the second disc more in higher gear. The song is a lot heavier in music and in lyrics. It deals with Pinkie thinking he's really the running \\"the show\\" in his own way.<br /><br />I do like The Wall, but I don't think it's \\"perfect\\" like the Dark Side of the Moon. One of the problems I have with this album is there's too much Roger Waters' music rather than Gilmour's...or even Wright's. now I know there will be some of you will tell me \\"THE WALL IS THEIR BEST! YOU'RE NOT A PINK FLOYD FAN IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE WALL!\\" I do like the album, guys, but the point I'm trying to address is this: Roger Waters is good, yes, but he was too controlling in this album...and he had total control with The Final Cut. There's time I wish in this album that have Richard Wright's or David Gilmour's music style rather than Roger's.  \\"The Thin Ice\\" could have been better. I wish the beginning and middle were different, because I really skip the track when I heard Wright's keyboard in the middle. I'm not blaming Wright, I'm blaming Waters, because he had a lot more control Pink Floyd's both music and lyrics at this time. However, the track does in with Gilmour's heavy guitar. \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" and \\"Empty Spaces\\" are tracks I do like to listen, but not as often as the tracks in my second paragraph. \\"One of My Turns,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me Now,\\" and \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" are tracks that are worth listening to, but not totally great. \\"Is There Anybody Out There,\\" \\"Nobody Home,\\" and \\"Vera\\" are the same for me on the second disc...they could have been a lot better. I still have a problem with listening to \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" and \\"In the Flesh.\\" \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" is a pointless track, I think. It's just one of those Pink Floyd songs I still have a problem to, such as \\"Quicksilver\\" from More and a couple on Ummagumma. \\"In the Flesh\\" doesn't really live up to \\"In the Flesh?\\" on the first disc. \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" is good, but needs more depth. \\"Stop\\" is another pointless one. \\"The Trial\\" wasn't good as I thought. It sounds like a weird movie track that supposed to bring humor, that's  how I really hear the track, sorry for the ones that really, really like the song.\\"Outside the Wall\\" has the beginning of \\"In the Flesh?\\" sound, such as the children singing wordlessly. I'm not really into this track as well, no matter how much I listen to it.<br /><br />Yes, The Wall turned me on to Pink Floyd, but after listening to other Pink Floyd albums...I don't think this album is totally \\"great.\\" Good, yes, but not absolutely great. The Wall isn't one my \\"favorite Pink Floyd albums\\" list, because I can not really listen all way through the album. I wish I could, but I can't. And yes, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is one of my favorites. Some of you, pure Roger Waters fans, had all ready said \\"Oh please, this guy is nuts. David Gilmour ruined Pink Floyd!\\" The truth is, he didn't. He might for you, Roger Water fans, but he didn't for me. I actually think he helped Pink Floyd, because he didn't let Roger gets his way. And by the way, The Final Cut wasn't all that good, and it was supposed to be their last album. Think God David Gilmour delivered two more albums. Ad yes, Animals is one of my favorites as well. Some of you will ask why since Waters was getting in control of the band---I felt that David gave is own style of music in that album, not purely Waters type of style. I'm not trying to be cocky, I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, have every album, but The Wall is one of the Pink Floyd albums I just can not fully listen too. Yes, there are some very, very good tracks on The Wall, but there's others that needed work as well. I just wish the band should have worked together rather than let Waters have had his own way, because some of his music...well...let me say \\"interesting.\\"<br /><br />And I also like their Experience edition for this album, some tracks shouldn't have had been cut out!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is a great game.  it brings back memories from playing the original Oregon trail in school.  I like it.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|An amazing book!!!! If you are into comedy greek gods horses violent sayters and exploding things this is the book for you. a detailed and rich storyline filled with light humor to get you through the [rare] unexciting parts<br />warning WILL NOT MAKE SENSE IF U HAVENT READ THE OTHER BOOKS
098357670X|5.0|I borrowed this from the library, so very glad I stumbled upon it, had to buy my own! Drawing is about learning to see correctly as much as anything, and Tom Richmond magically opens the eyes for almost instant improvement. Thanks for sharing the tricks of the trade, Tom, much easier to capture the essence of human individuality now.
0316056863|5.0|Read this book in a day. It is hilarious and insightful and just plain entertaining. Highly recommend it as a gift to any women in her early twenties because it realy does give good advice and especially good for people who are interested in show business.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Excellent writing style by ELJ---but a very weak story line overall.  Cute personality study, but that's about it for content.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loce, love, love this book - couldn't put it down!!  Lots of action and suspense. I bought the 3rd book immediately!
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is great fun. if you like puzzles this is the game for you. and free is always good right?
B008966SIU|5.0|Wow! Veckatimest was excellent. This one is just as good. Great songwriting, with a hint of the bittersweet, with some added swagger.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Another triumph from the man himself. This book is everything the first one is and more. More characters have been added which gives the story more depth. I can't put this one down. Great stuff!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|The main takeaway is that character is the key to success, particularly for those who may not have a family safety net. The book draws on a broad range of examples, from educators at KIPP charter schools to a health center serving poor children in San Francisco, to research studies on the effect of stress on brain development. Tough cites the emerging body of research on the role that non-cognitive skills, referred to broadly as \\"character,\\" play in success. He connects the research to the many failed experiments in education reform and suggests that building character traits like grit and perseverance may be the most helpful intervention for poor children.<br /><br />I would have liked to see Tough talk more about the process of building character. Some of the things KIPP is doing sounds a bit rigid and too formulaic for my liking.  Tough cites some nonprofits who seem to be able to help young people build character but he does not really explain how they do it. KIPP's approach is to provide students with a \\"character report card\\" and make them hyper-aware of seven character traits. It left me wondering if character can be built by metacognition. If we want to students to have more grit, how does that translate into a school or curriculum design? Does/should it translate?
B0091QSNEE|5.0|my 3 yr old LOVES all of the Dr. Panda games! Both the Vet game and this one. She loves to help cook in real life, and has a blast cooking items for the animals in the restaurant. These are her favorite games and is usually playing one or the other. Very well made, great graphics, easy to figure out, and a lot of different things to do. keeps her entertained for a long time on our long trips across the country.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|This is one is a favorite of my wife and I. Both watched it as kids and now get to watch in better quality.
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|This cook book tells you more than how to cook, It also gives advice on how to shop for ingredients, utensils, and more. It contains much which is useful even while cooking non-French foods. It is one of the best reading investments I have made.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Great, fab, fabulous, terrific, superb and diva all in one package on one dvd. Includes great images. You will be pleased.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I listened to the whole album after hearing \\"It's Time\\" on an independent radio station here in Cleveland. This song is great, and \\"Demons\\" is pretty good too, but the album as a whole did not grab me like these two wonderful songs. I do respect their lyrics though, as they have no profanity and no questionable subject matter.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great  story .  Kept me locked in throughout the entire book.    if you liked 50 shades, you'll love this series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once again I am drawn into Gideon and Eva's world.  I have wondered at times how people who have traumas in their lives learn to move forward.  Sylvia Day has given me that opportunity and I feel like I have lived it too.  Great second book and I am looking forward to reading more on Gideon and Eva. I feel like Eva is beginning to grow and truly trust what they have.  Gideon is truly beginning to see how much he is worth her love. The sex was pretty fantastic too in a tasteful way.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The Jack Reacher books are among my favorites, this one \\"not so much\\".  It was almost like Child had an outline and just used the \\"Cut and Paste\\" feature on his computer to fill in the blanks.
B0031RDVNM|4.0|Another \\"cannot put it down\\" thriller from the master of the agent/spy genre. The Avenger goes from Sleepy Hollow to white knuckle tension and leaves the breathless reader satisfied justice is done. One wonders where the author gets his insight, and information, of the workings of the intelligence agencies to seem so spot on. It is almost as if he has carried out some of the plot to see that it is as plausible as described in the book.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|In retrospect, maybe it took me some time (i.e. ~3 decades) to fully grow into \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\" I appreciated it, but preferred the energy and story lines of \\"Born to Run.\\" In recent years, I feel like I better understand and now admire the creative brilliance of the period that generated both \\"Darkness...\\" and this amazing set of songs on \\"The Promise.\\" I disagree with criticism below that this is somehow a lesser work from The Boss. Arguably, there is no such thing, but who I am to say: I am a fan. \\"The Promise\\" is a wonderful set of songs; a set that fed the careers of Southside Johnny, Patti Smith, The Pointer Sisters, and others. And for good reason. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|at first, I wasn't sure I would like this game, but once I started playing, I realized what a great game it is!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|FANTASTICLY HILARIOUS. watch this movie, it really blew my mind when i went to the theater expecting something terrible and cheesy.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|AAs usual Lee Child's does it again. Jack Reacher shows a little more of the softer side of the hard core man. Child's never misses a beat. Great read as stand alone or if you follow Reacher

B008MEM24S|5.0|It is a wonderful game. I would recommend it to anyone. If you thinking of this game. Get it! Brain thinker. Not only do you get Perry out but think while doing it. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003B02O0A|2.0|It was a well told story but I don't support what Carl Lee Haly did. I support the right to self-defense and the right to defend what's yours. I do not however support revenge. The difference between the two is like night and day. Had Carl Lee happened upon the two dirtbags raping his daughter and took them out (like a man in Texas did earlier this year), I would have admired that a lot more. And quite frankly I think that would`ve perhaps made for a good story.<br /><br />  This whole book basically glorifies revenge and vigilante justice. The evidence against the two rapists were overwhelming. There is no way they would have skated.<br /><br />  A story about self-defense and protecting your loved ones IMO has a much better message. This book was instead about revenge.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is awesome a cool survival skills awesome graphics love how you can make your own name and can be on creative.
B004IF8TLU|5.0|My wife is a big fan of obscure '80's movies and this is one of her favorites. She suggested that we watch it together. It is just as silly and kitschy as I expected, but also amazingly fun! I laughed out loud throughout the movie and I've had the \\"Babysitting Blues,\\" an impromptu song that the characters perform in the movie, stuck in my head ever since we watched. Highly recommended if you are, like my wife and I, a child of the '80's.

B008QE9VJI|4.0|Barnabas Collins is a vampire from the 18th century whose curse came from a jilted lover who turned out to be a vengeful witch, Angelique Bouchard. Angelique also caused the deaths of Barnabas's parents and his true love, Josette DuPres. And now, when Barnabas is awakened in 1972, he finds Angelique's torture of his family continues. Along with other secret attacks, she has become a wealthy fishing magnate and driven the Collins family out of business. But now that Barnabas is back, he is determined to restore the family honor as the true royalty of Collinsport, Maine. Using his old world charm and vampire gifts, he takes on Angelique in a grudge match to the finish.<br /><br />As a hardcore Dark Shadows fan, I gotta say, that sounds like a pretty decent movie version of the classic show. Plus, you have a great cast bringing to life many of the classic characters from the 60's/70's, supernatural soap opera and its 90's, nighttime soap revival. Johnny Depp is Barnabas, Michelle Pfeiffer is Elizabeth, Chloe Grace Moretz is Carolyn, and Helena Bonham Carter is Dr. Hoffman, to name a few. Tim Burton's gothic style seems a perfect match, and as I said, the plot SOUNDS excellent. I mean, compare it to the first ever Dark Shadows feature with the original cast. This one has a basic story that does a much better job capturing the story of the TV show than the first film, which was just a typical Dracula type movie. In this one, Barnabas is both good and bad, he battles, and the villain is Angelique, as it should be in a Dark Shadows movie about Barnabas. So, why was this not the PERFECT big budget Dark Shadows movie fans have dreamed of?<br /><br />Well, personally, I would have aimed for two trilogies. One telling a three part Barnabas story, and the other telling a three part Quentin werewolf story that includes Barnabas (as a vampire and a good guy). This, to me, is the only way to do the show justice on the big screen. Of course, another important note, I would NOT have made them comedies. Let's face it, that was one of the big issues the fans had with this film. It's not that a Dark Shadows comedy is such a bad thing, it's just that Dark Shadows didn't need to resort to that. This could have been such an epic movie-going experience. It has NOT been done before. Not on the bigscreen with a huge budget, cast, and director. This is such a perfect example of missed opportunity. But, bear with me, I am going to speak well of the film too.<br /><br />But first, let's get more into the negatives. After all, being a comedy doesn't make this a bad film. In truth, it isn't a bad film, it's just not a very good Dark Shadows film. This is not so much because it's a dark comedy, it's because it took far too many liberties to even feel like a true spoof of the original. This film's two biggest problems were an awkward climax and characters that had little in common with the known versions beyond their names and, in some cases, appearances. Yes, Roger and Julia Hoffman were great likenesses of the originals, but they sure weren't playing those characters at all. Why not? I have no idea. Michelle Pfieffer definitely wasn't playing Elizabeth as we have ever known her, nor was Carolyn anything like Carolyn, and I cut Carolyn a lot of slack in this because of her big secret (badly done as it was), which is something I tend to be partial to, and because Chloe Moretz grows more lovely every day. Willie was yet another complete recreation. Fair enough, but I've always said the original Willie was one of the best things that show had going for it, so I don't know why he is turned into more and more of a throwaway, loser character with each version. David was not much like previous Davids either, Mrs. Johnson was a barely moving old woman sight gag, and Barnabas, well, Barnabas... I won't say I didn't like the character Johnny Depp portrayed here, but this wasn't really Barnabas either. Seriously. All I can say is that Angelique was decent (though she got too weird in the climax) and Victoria, well, that character never was much, even though she was important, and she is way more interesting here. At least, her backstory is. It doesn't feel like we really get to spend much getting to know her, though she is definitely a vision to look upon (amazing eyes and love her cutesy outfits). Naturally, having the characters not reflect the originals very much if at all is rather disappointing for fans of the original show. But, besides that, you have moments where you just have to ask, \\"Why?\\" Was it just to annoy us? I mean, moments like when David refers to Barnabas as \\"Uncle Barnabas\\" instead of \\"Cousin Barnabas\\". I mean, we go out of your was to make this is different from the source material as possible? Those are the kinds of choices I never really can get.<br /><br />Besides that, as I said, there is the issue of a very messy climax. This thing was all over the place, throwing too much at you at once and with some very awkward, at times just plain bad lines and acting. One particular reveal about Carolyn comes with some of the worst dialogue (which poor Chloe had to give) that I've ever heard. I could have gotten totally behind this if weren't for that line, a few complaints about the visuals, and the fact that it really felt thrown in. When you know about it already, you can see the little hints in the film, but they are just a smidge too subtle to not make it feel totally thrown in the first time you see the film. Speaking of the first time you see the film, yeah, it's going to look pretty messy. Once you have seen it already, you can take in everything a bit easier. But the first time, Burton is just trying to throw way too much at you way too fast. A most notable one is the relationship between Doc Hoffman and Barnabas. This is only slightly touched upon here, but it is a big deal when it is (and no, it's not like any fan of the shows would imagine it to be). Basically, if you blink, you can miss things here that come back later, and yet, overall, it feels like only a few things were important to the plot at all. It ends up feeling very random and messy, and it's probably much worse if you are not familiar with the original TV show. Not that this film follows that at all, but, well, at least you will \\"get\\" some aspects of the Doc Hoffman situation, anyway.<br /><br />To move onto the flipside though, this film is not a total loss. The bottom line is, it is a lot of fun to watch. Not everyone will think so, I know, but even as a true fan of the previous two TV shows, I do enjoy this film. It has some very funny moments (though some of the jokes are really lame too, like the McDonald's one that I'm sure the filmmakers thought was comedy gold). It does have some awkward scenes, like the love scene that seems to imply sex, though not really..., and the finale that really is a pretty big problem (am I wrong, or is there a big loose end there involving what everyone in town saw and heard?), but it's also got really neat stuff too, like Alice Cooper giving a performance at Collinwood and some of the original Dark Shadows cast members in attendance. There's a lot to be bugged by in this film, but there's a lot to like and enjoy too. The most difficult part is getting past the opening (just after the prologue), in which Victoria is riding a train to Collinwood and \\"Nights in White Satin\\" is playing. The problem with that scene is, that looks like a completely different and far better film. Actually, that looks like an incredible, amazing Dark Shadows movie! It really emphasizes the missed opportunity here. But, this one, honestly, is still fun. Some moments feel a bit amateurish to be coming from Burton, but a lot of it is just sooo very entertaining, it is hard not to like, even for a fan of the shows. But, it does leave me with concern that now, one of my other top favorite shows, Kolchak the Night Stalker, is on Depp's to do list (so I can't help but wonder if that means Burton tot too weird in the climax) and Victoria, well, that character never was much, even though she was important, and she is way more interesting here. At least, her backstory is. It doesn't feel like we really get to spend much getting to know her, though she is definitely a vision to look upon (amazing eyes and love her cutesy outfits).

The problem with that scene is, that looks like a completely different and far better film. Actually, that looks like an incredible, amazing Dark Shadows movie! It really emphasizes the missed opportunity here. But, this one, honestly, is still fun. Some moments feel a bit amateurish to be coming from Burton, but a lot of it is just sooo very entertaining, it is hard not to like, even for a fan of the shows. But, it does leave me with concern that now, one of my other top favorite shows, Kolchak the Night Stalker, is on Depp's to do list (so I can't help but wonder if that means Burton too). Honestly, I always hoped to one day make Dark Shadows and Kolchak movies myself, though, I have so many projects on my mind and so little funds that I hardly expect to get to most of them. I enjoy my down time far too much.<br /><br />Getting to the Blu-Ray (and a key thing to remember is that the \\"movie-only\\" blu-ray, I hear, does not come with bonus features, so we are forced to pay more for the digital copy and DVD), it naturally looks and sounds gorgeous, so what are the bonus features. Well, I could have hoped for more, but we do get deleted scenes and a nice collection of \\"Making Of\\" material, though it badly needed a \\"Play All\\" feature. Also, there is an option to watch the film with even more interviews and behind the scenes footage, including some interviews with original cast members; a pretty nice inclusion. Still, more features could have been had here, from the obvious to the not-so-obvious. The film, when/where I got it came with a slipcover featuring a hologram of Barnabas, though not an interesting, changing one or anything. It's pretty static.<br /><br />And, that's about it. \\"Dark Shadows\\", not the movie Dark Shadows fans wanted, not a great Dark Shadows movie, and a very flawed movie in general, but also very unique and fun for both fans and newcomers, and great for the Halloween season. It's worth checking out for some laughs or the lovely ladies, or if you're a Burton fanatic, like so many are. I'm happy to have it in my collection, though don't think it reflects the original or 90's versions at all. And, I know the original show is pretty steep on DVD (like, what, 500 or so for the complete series?), but at the very least, you should check out the 90's show, and that one is probably pretty cheap to buy these days. It was REALLY GOOD, and it's what got me into Dark Shadows to begin with. I was pretty obsessed with it, even though they never got around to the werewolves before it was canceled. What a shame the 2000's version never got pickedup! Marley Shelton as Victoria? I would have enjoyed that.

B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows along with Dexter, True Blood, and The Walking Dead. The show and the storyline is very creepy just by itself. The acting is above average. There never was an episode where I lost interest.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br />The only thing that I did not like about this show is that everyone in the family dies.<br /><br />I understood the daughter's death, but why her parents? Was it the show was getting lower ratings towards the end? Were the actor's contracts up after one season? Who knows. I get that things were rocky with the parents from the get go. I think the storyline would have been more interesting, to me, if the parents survived and were able to move out of that house. However, the baby being a harbor for evil would bring the evil with him to their new home. I am interested in what Asylum will bring. I am confused as to why Zachary Quinto is being brought back, even though he is a great actor, but what about the baby?<br /><br />To end this review, I've visited the house down in the Los Angeles area during the day and at night. 'Twas epic. One of the days I went to visit and they were filming!
B007TML4EI|2.0|Game has seriously ugly animation.  Make me sick looking at it.  Game is a clone of other games like it.  Protect \\"blank\\" by building a structure.  The only original part is the dummy thing, and that idea was obviously thought up by a dummy.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This film feels like a drug-induced nightmare. Tilda Swinton's performance is extraordinary. And so are the three young actors that play Kevin. The music selections are tremendously odd and off-kilter, which lends to the overall bizarre and terrifying tone of the movie. It takes a while to settle in to the film's style, but it's very well done. \\"The Omen\\" level is high with this one. Pregnant ladies - do not watch. LOL
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I liked the authors portrayal of a15 year old boy.  The sense of innocence and willingness to do as his parents ask him is touching.  He shows the confusion of a teenager of trying to trust the adults in his life when all of the rules change.

B008966SLM|5.0|Robert Cray never disappoints and his latest CD is no exception.  If you're torn between downloading or buying the CD, I highly recommend the CD because it comes with a 10 page mini-biography liner note about the making of the CD.  One thing about Cray is there's always one standout song above the rest on every album.  This album is no exception and \\"Won't Be Coming Home\\" is the standout song on this one.  Highly, highly recommended.  Like a fine wine, Robert Cray only gets better with time.
0316223239|2.0|I only got past the first three pages because I wanted to know that the fuss was about.<br /><br />While the story was interesting, albeit unoriginal, the concept was contrived. From the beginning, Jack's thought process and his ability to verbalize was so disjointed that I didn't think I could get through the book. Children learn how to speak by hearing others. So, even though Jack had been deprived of social stimulus, he wasn't raised by wolves and his mother had a full grasp of the English language. In the end, they catch their first colds. The mother, whose real name we never find out, has to teach Jack how to blow his nose yet he knows what snot is. He also watched TV, so it didn't make sense that he doesn't have a concept for some things. Additionally, it's my understanding that people who have been kidnapped have been so terrorized that their captors can control them even when they're out in public. There would have been no reason to keep the mother locked up for seven years without letting her our into the world. To me, it seems that the author really didn't do her researched.<br /><br />I have to say that I did get through the whole book rather quickly because I wanted to see what happened to them, but I'm glad I only spent $.60 on this book. It will be going back to the thrift store.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Disappointed in the end, she rushed it and could have done a better job...  But the book was still good and definitely unpredictable
B004I8WD6E|3.0|I always place my phone in the front pocket of my pants but after 3 months it has accumulated a fair amount of dirt and dust in the edges of the case. I have tried cleaning it but it still remains a little yellow and dusty around the edges. I just would not recommend buying a clear case for a white phone.<br /><br />However if you can keep it clean it is does a good job from protecting your phone from normal everyday things. For example it has already survived a few drops from 4ft, my baby niece playing with it, and walking around all day with it in my pocket next to keys.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the fact my employer requires clear cases on phones, I would purchase the darker Amazon case because it does a good job of protecting the phone for a reasonable price.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was an absolute breathtaking book. Could not put it down, but if I did, Mr. handsome Grey was all I could think about... \\"what's his next move\\".<br />It was both fun and embarrasing to read at the same time. I think the author has done a good job in terms of details. I really love the way she writes. I, however, am not giving this book five stars, becuase I think the author repeated a lot of sessions too many times (i.e the biting in lip thing). I was bored reading that after a while. Rather than that I think the book was very fun to read. I've already purchased the second book and is enjoying this just as much.

B004A2V3K0|5.0|I was an '80s kid, so I grew up listening to Bon Jovi music.  To me, these are his best hits (hence the title.)  I looked at the 2-disc version but I didn't see much on disc 2 that I really liked, so I went with the single disc version and I'm really happy.  All of my favorite Bon Jovi songs are on here and a couple I'm not that familiar with, but I really enjoyed the whole album.  The .mp3 audio quality is really good.  I hooked my tablet into my stereo and cranked it up to jam to this great collection.

JD's facial expressions were wonderful and the weight of the characters as they move about makes this movie very believable. This CGI movie easily destroy's any of the live action films and is up there with any block buster film released this year.<br /><br />Just like what I've seen in other reviews, this is a movie is an excellent example on when things are done right. The studio's involved deserve an award.

He is back on his game and he has done a very fine job with The Litigators.  It's clever, funny, touching and ironic. And it is SO visual.  If they make a movie I hope they don't screw it up.  Read it!  You won't be sorry.

B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Great movie with great actors.  It's good to see a movie that is true to life and relationships that don't always end up in a general happy summary in the last few minutes like a Grey's Anatomy episode, usually with The Fray playing in the background.  This movie is well written and well directed.  It's good to still come a cross movies that agree that happy endings suck.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Whedon really took the best of each actor's superhero character and put them together in this film.  I would suspect having Robert Downey Jr. in the cast raised the bar for the other actors, and so long as he is in a scene there is no chance it would devolve to kitsch.  All the lead characters are stunningly sexy and good looking, which never hurts, and I liked how they changed some of the uniforms to show some more flesh, which definitely made them more believable (and fun to look at).  The visual effects and 3D elements are excellent .
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As a Reacher fan, the latest addition to the saga does not fail to keep you guessing.  Even if you are new to the series, you will completely enjoy it!  And then you will want to start from the beginning to fill in some blanks!  Absolutely wonderful- impatiently waiting for the next adventure!
0452273331|4.0|Ayn Rand is one of those people where either you like her or you don't.  That said, I'll begin by stating that I have first read this book in 1974, at the age of 17, after \\"We The Living\\" and \\"Anthem\\" and before \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"  I have just read this again after reading \\"Atlas Shrugged (for the fourth time) and just about Atlas Shrugged Part II is about to be released.<br />  I say this because while \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" deals with the lives of industrial titans and their dealings with the world, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is more on a personal level about one individual architect, and those in his circle.  One can more identify with Howard Roark than with John Galt.  (See my review on \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\")<br />  Note, this is a book about an architect, but it is not about architecture.  It is about one man who is an architect, who loves his profession so much that he has new original ideas in his profession that the rest of society was not ready to accept.  In a way, it is probably based on the life and creations of Frank Lloyd Wright.  This is the opinion of an architect whom I know personally, and I know nothing about Wright.  Rand, did, however, do research on this subject, and obtained information from professionals in this field.<br />  The book is divided into four sections, each focusing on one particular character, of which each section is titled: Peter Keating, Ellsworth M. Toohey, Gail Wynand, and Howard Roark, each in the order of this list.<br />  The protagonist is, of course, Howard Roark, who, as an architect, rejects the tradition Greek and Renaissance style of buildings, and comes up with a new style all his own.  This is a style in which the building blend in with the landscape, the environment, and is also engineer-friendly (my phrase) where it would be easy to install the plumbing and electricity, and have repair mean have easy access to it.  How these buildings look is left up to the reader's imagination.<br />  Society, however, was not ready to accept his new style.  The book begins with Howard Roark get expelled from the Architectural School of the Stanton Institute of Technology, located in Stanton, Massachusetts.  This was just as he was to graduate.  Roark is called to see the Dean, on account of his works, not found to be acceptable, and his refusal to comply to the school's standards.  Roark wouldn't budge, and he chose expulsion.  Peter Keating, one of his \\"competitors\\" (note the quotes) graduates with honors, chosen most likely to succeed, and it snatched up by a prominent firm, Francon & Heyer.  Roark moves to New York, is hired by a forgotten architect named Henry Cameron, and struggles for work.<br />  This is where the story begins.  Peter Keating becomes prominent, wanted by builders, is promoted in his firm, and will trample on others in order for him to achieve promotion.  He had only one fault-he couldn't design anything.  Because of this, whenever he was commissioned to do a complex design for a skyscraper, he would panic, and run to Roark to have him design it for him, taking the credit for it-and Howard didn't seem to mind it.  Keating received a lot of commendations, but the guilt of his living a lie continued to gnaw at him.  The moral here was when Roark asked Keating, \\"Do you love what you are doing?\\"  Keating didn't answer, but it seemed that he got into it either for the money and/or the prestige, and Howard Roark decided to become an architect from his childhood on, and his heart was into it.  Here lies the secret of life.  If one chooses a profession, he or she should do it out of the love for it, not the glory.  Keating's lies do catch up with him.<br />  Other characters of whom Roark has to deal with focus on Ellsworth M. Toohey, a newspaper editor who lusts for power over people, and will stop at nothing to get it.  Gail Wynand (a male despite his first name), who owns the tabloid paper, \\"The New York Banner,\\" who knows of Roark's talents and makes use of them for his own ends.  Wynand knows the talents and value of Roark's works and can see in them what society at that time doesn't, but has also blended in with society and has enough power to get what he wants.  He knows, but also knows how to go with the flow, all to his advantage.<br />  One last character worth mentioning is the daughter of another prominent architect, Dominique Francon, daughter of Guy Fraction, the boss who hired Keating in the first place.  She is one person who loved Roark from the very beginning, yet, in order to protect him, prevents him from getting commissions.  This is s very complex woman, very beautiful, who marries two people whom she despises, Peter Keating and then Gail Wynand, in order to help Roark.  Talk about self sacrifice.<br />  A lot happens, and Roark always fights society, but this book does have a happy ending.<br />  There is a lot more to it, though, philosophy wise.  Objectivism is the main point, standing up for oneself and what one believes.  Selfishness is preached as a virtue, but in a sense of not only sticking with your beliefs, but, mainly, of learning how to say \\"no.\\"  This can be a very hard work to say, having only two letters, but it is a necessity.  This is selfishness versus self-less-ness, losing one's identity in trying to please everybody, which, in this book is the real villain: society expecting you to please them, versus hanging on to your own life, your beliefs, and your loves.  If you try to please everyone, you will lose your own self.<br />  There is one point who Roark is asked what he thinks about somebody he doesn't like.  His answer?  \\"I don't think of him.\\"  That's a good example to follow rather than to get angry.<br />  The villains are not only those who preach the concept of pleasing everyone, but also those who leech off of people like Peter Keating did with Roark.  the power hungry, like Ellsworth Toohey, and the rich who feel that they can control others and get what they want at other people's expense, like Gail Wynand.<br />  Howard Roark is a stoic who takes it in stride, lives in New York and always returns, but goes to work in other towns in the meantime to support himself.<br />  The plot thickens at the very end of the book where Roark designs a housing unit for Keating, who panicked as usual, and Roark sketches it for him, and is willing to let Keating put his own name to it providing that nothing on the drawing is changed.  Well, Keating tries to comply, but behind his back the commissioners do change the design, and Roark exerts his wrath.  I won't say any more.<br />  All in all, the setting itself is not as big as \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" and the world goes on as usual, but in this small circle, the individual conflicts with society, and that is why many can identify with this book.  The time is set in the early 1930s, during the Depression, but the story is timeless.  You can imagine the scenery in today's settings as well.  The dialogue is also more down to earth, some philosophy, but it mostly what you could hear in a real life conversation.<br />  As Rand said, \\"The Fountainhead,\\" serves as an overture to \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"  Her next novel, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is more massive, and involves the world!d knows the talents and value of Roark's works and can see in them what society at that time doesn't, but has also blended in with society and has enough power to get what he wants.

B004O7EVLY|5.0|This is Graveyard's second release from 2011 and it is an instant classic. If you didn't know when it was released you would instantly think that it was 70's blues rock. These Swedes specialize in replicating that classic heavy blues rock sound from over 40 years ago.<br /><br />Sounds like, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Cream, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix,Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Steppenwolf, to name a few.<br /><br />\\"Guitarists Joakim Nilsson and Jonatan Ramm continue to churn out the blues-drenched riffs and expressive solos; bassist Rikard Edlund and drummer Axel Sj&ouml;berg hold down the fort with a rhythm section that's as fluid as it is heavy, while Nilsson shows impressive versatility, ranging from upper register Robert Plant-style screams to gentle blue-eyed soul.\\"<br /><br />These guys can really kick it into overdrive, without missing a beat, just pure perfection. They are high energy with classic sounding riffs. The songs and solos are very free flowing with great rhythmic presence. These guys are new but play the old, that's what makes them unique.<br /><br />This CD has attracted a lot of positive interest because of the bands attention to detail, keeping true to the authentic 70's style of music they deliver.<br /><br />This is high quality, all natural music made the way it used to be. Not like some of the boring repetitive crap that's out there today.<br /><br />If you miss the music from the good ol' days, this one's for you.<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Graveyard's \\"Hisingen Blues\\" on You Tube.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed the story Fifty Shades of Grey.  The story brought romance back into my marriage and the story was well written. It hooks you from chapter one.  I will read all three of the books and plan to watch the movie if it ever came out!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This gun is everything it purports to be!  If you don't like violent toys, then it isn't for you.  Move on!  But, if you're not worried about that, this is great!<br /><br />It holds lots of ammo and shoots fairly far.  Reasonably straight, too!  It's not the most durable toy in the world: if you drop it while running, I suspect it could break.  But it won't easily break during ordinary use.  Also, the nerf bullets don't hurt that much. Could they take out an eye?  Possibly, I guess.  But I'm not worried about it.<br /><br />I also wish it came with more clips and amo.  It comes with four clips, when the gun can hold eight, and 24 bullets (6 per clip).  But you can buy four more.  Or you can buy larger clips.<br /><br />Overall, if you are interested in this toy, then go for it!  It's tons of fun.  If you hate violence, then why are you bothering to read this review?
1568363850|4.0|THis book is very good in that it has repetition of many of the phrases/words in different context.  The only thing that would be better is the CD, which is the listening of the language.  If the person could speak slower, it would help to hear what they are saying better.
B008H6GHL0|2.0|Resident Evil Damnation is an action/adventure techno-thriller, which is great if your into that sort of thing. Having just replayed Resident 1, 2, and 3 this year, I find this CGI movie at odds with the franchise's dark, brooding gothic origins. In Damnation, no one is conserving ammo or running for their lives or using stealth. Instead, the bright sunlit movie is loud, brazen, and in your face with an unlimited cache of weapons and ammo. As a horror fan that was expecting survival horror, I was not happy. I feel Capcom is selling out simply to keep the franchise alive and fresh. It's time to retire RE with dignity.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I think this is the best Jack Reacher/Lee Childs book ever.  I have read all his books and really enjoyed them but this one I could not put down.  Wonderful!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Riveting!  This triology left me wanting more by Suzanne Collins.  The ending could not be predicted. What more could one  want?
0385738765|5.0|Love love this book.  I enjoyed it even more than the first book.  It is full of so many twists and unexpected surprises.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time!  You get to know WICKED a little more but are still left with so many questions...which I'm hoping is all revealed in the last book!  I really like all of the characters in this book including a few new characters that are introduced.  I just truly enjoyed this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Warning it's addictive. When I start playing this game it's hard to stop.  It's ruined my routine and chores go undone. Play at your own risk.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The book was very readable. There were twists in the plot at every high-paced turn of the page. My only disappointment, however, was the shallow background research on the main character. Reacher is a Marine Corps brat who attended West Point and began an abortive Army career. I am also a military brat who attended a service academy. Other than having served in both combat and covert activities, our backgrounds have almost no common ties. I only attended three high schools. I never knew any fellow brats who did more than four. Although every new school provided my brother and me at least one opportunity to display our pugilistic skills, this was less a way of life than it was a way of initiation. Once we showed ourselves \\"worthy,\\" we were then generally accepted. Once commissioned, nobody, but NOBODY did my laundry for me. Maybe the Brits still have buttboys, but the US Army certainly does not. Lee Child was a journalist for several years, so I would've expected better background research, even on a pulp novel such as this. All this aside, however, the book is quite fast-paced and entertaining. As would be expected in such literature, character development is very lacking. The view of Southern society and politics is stereotypical to the point of being insulting. I guess this is normal coming from a foreigner. Rant off. Read and enjoy the book. It's fun to see Jack Reacher leave more bodies in his wake than Jack Bauer (minus the tortuous interrogations). Have fun.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|nancy reagan said just say no.  but almost everything has a flip side.  the flip side to this game is a positive addiction.  love it, love it, love it!!  game is reminiscent of tetrus with the falling tiles and your ability to position wisely. for the more mature player it encourages you to think and rejuvenate the gray matter. for our younger counterparts it allows them to learn math skills while enjoying the game.  it proves learning can be fun while us old timers learn:yeah,i still got it!
B005JLN9OO|5.0|Feist singles herself out on this album as a true great among the rest. do yourself a favor and give this one a listen to.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the real arcade game I don't want to put it down.  The coins will just hang and make you think about whereto push the bunch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought this was an interest game.Even better when I updated it because when the game ends, it would ask you if you wanted to retry it or play a different game.My eight year old daughter plays many challenges.Plus theres a minimum of points you need to get in each game.
0345803485|1.0|It's not a book, it's... look the title. And this is a bestseller? It could be just one possible explanation: the editors have lost their mind. I don't recommend this book to anyone. Pity that you have to check out at least one star - this... no, not book, but something with meaningless words doesn't deserve any star.
6304331851|5.0|I bought this for my Aunt for her birthday last month, and she absolutely adores it! She watches it at least once a week :)
B0098VXE50|2.0|I was expecting it be more along the story but as usual the movie industry glamorized it with their own twist on the original. No worth buying. Charlize was awesome I it she made the movie as others have said.
B000S9M2MM|1.0|The product I received in the mail did not look like what it does online (and mine had water damage!).  Maybe I missed something, but that came as a shock.  The customer assistant thought Amazon was very helpful, but I decided not to go to all the trouble of sending it back because I didn't think it worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the most user friendly versions of solitaire that I have ever played.  I have been a solitaire player even before there were were electronic devices.  I'm a FAN!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Excellent psychological mystery with lots of surprises. Fast pacing and excellent writing made this the best book of the year for me.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good read. not what i was expecting but a good read overall. i would recommend it as a good light read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have not completed this book. But if it is anything like the first two, it won't disappoint. I really have enjoyed the theme.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I love this CD. I think the true test of a good CD is whether you can listen to it clear through? Check. Can you listen to it over and over again? Check. Does every song bring something different but good? Check. My two favorites are \\"Settle Down\\" and \\"Undone.\\" I'm a No Doubt and Gwen Stefani fan, true. But, this is an awesome CD. I listened to it over and over for three hours while I cleaned. It kept me going, kept me energized, and I had to sit down and listen to the words of Undone because it was just that good. Definitely recommend.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|As with movie from book titles .. so much character development and plot is missing. Makes for a very limited experience of the story.<br />That being send .. it was an entertaining movie and I would watch it again.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|It's not my favorite CD of theirs, but I don't regret buying it. I listened to it one all the way through, which is a test in and of itself for me. But, there was no one song that just \\"got\\" me.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|The movie was good and action packed. It doesn't take long for the action to get started. It was not as good as the first movie but it does not disappoint.
B000NJM4JS|5.0|I pretty much love the new mixes as they reflect how The Doors actually sound without all the studio trickery. Really, only the first two albums are much different but what you hear in the DVDA mixes is pure Doors heaven. EVERYTHING is so damn close to you and sonically perfect in a sense. You have never heard the whole band like this and I think Jim would have been proud of what they accomplished. I got this set for 50 BUCKS! back when amazon had the import for sale so I cannot whine about the price. The slipcase is way too tight though and I cannot keep them in it without scratching the covers further.<br /><br />As for the content the ONLY thing is they did not include the original masters on the DVDA in high-res stereo at least though it looks like they had space to. Not a big deal as I doubt there was much more detail in those to be had. The do however include them in pristine CD quality on 6 of the discs. Pretty sure they are the old remasters which sounded great to my ears.<br /><br />Of course some people are not going to like the remixing and some of the added parts. I say HMPH to you. This is truly the best way to hear the band. Since the debut had a lot of reverb and studio trickery it can sound a bit pedestrian but it truly is still a great listen on the DVDA and sounds exactly how you would expect them too in crystal clear audio quality. The surround mixes are also fantastic and have a lot of nice separation and detail though I don't listen to them as much.<br /><br />Anyway you have it this boxset rocks. Don't listen to the haters The Doors have never sounded better.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase of the DVD complete set of I Dram of Jeannie.  It was presented in attractive box and I may pass it on to someone else when I finish watching the series.  I have never been disappointed in any DVD or book I've purchased via Amazon.com.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely great read all the way through all three books. Never a dull moment. First rate character development. I liked all the characters and they were interesting to boot.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Previously, I reviewed The Dark Knight Rises and gave it a low rating based on a single viewing in an IMAX theater.  Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the DVD with sub-titles, I've upped my rating considerably.  I missed so many subtleties of the film in the theater.  Major themes and plot developments were incomprehensible to me due to several characters' slurred speech and the rapid editing of some parts of the film.  Now, I see The Dark Knight Rises is a complex work that requires multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.  I still find the depictions of physical pain endured by several characters excessive, and it's not the perfect work that The Dark Knight is.  Nonetheless, it's a major work that will be admired long after most contemporary movies have been forgotten.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought at first that this was a kind of predictable plot, but I was so wrong.  This book has more twists and turns to it than a canyon road.  I changed my opinion of the characters all though the book.<br />Really great read.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Every song is very well done!!! Try, The Truth About Love, Slut Like You, Beam Me Up, and of course Blow Me (One Last Kiss), are my favorites!
B005N95JA4|4.0|This was one of the better Rolling Stones albums of the 1970s.  There were three hit songs from the album; \\"Miss You\\" (their last #1), \\"Beast of Burden\\" and \\"Shattered\\".  And the rest of the songs are good, too.  This deluxe edition includes a bonus disc of 12 more songs that may have been recorded at the same sessions.  Some of these tracks had new vocals and instrumentation added to them.  While these tracks generally aren't as good as the ones that actually made it onto the album, they are good in their own right.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book as much as the first one! I thought it was awesome. It was everything I wanted and more! I can't wait until book 3 is realeased in December.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use. Large buttons which is a plus. Has all features I was looking for in a calculator for my Kindle Fire.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|the app has helped me to manage my kindle.  I would recommend it others. I wish it gave suggestions to save power.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I finished this season just before Season 5 started, and couldn't wait for Castle and Beckett to be back in my world!!!!  They continue to be an interesting, fun, and delightfully nuanced couple.  The mysteries have great twists and turns, which make sense and take this series out of the routine tv mystery ho hum (where you love the characters, but the story line is thin and unsatisfying)<br />If you like good mysteries and Great Characters, and haven't watched Castle, give it a try, I think You will thoroughly enjoy yourself!!!!!<br />If you watched Seasons 1 through 3, and are worried that it may have gotten stale or run out of steam by Season 4...STOP Worrying...It Just Keeps Getting Better!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was so much better than 50 shades. Yes, there is a lot more parts of the book that are severely more graphic, but this is an adult book. I finished the second book in 2 days and I can't wait till the release of the third!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so cool it has so many options and places you can go. I think it is so worth $6.99
B001NLKT60|5.0|this is the second of three books, all three must be read in sequence. I had trouble putting them down. Best books I have read in quite a few years
B008S4FZ6E|5.0|Loved it.  Very entertaining and a very good insight on what its like to have success at a very young age and all the pressures that come with that.  Amazing to see the turn around of Johns life and how very differently hes enjoying the success today as a much older and wiser person.  Good read .....
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love what I've read so far, only half way through the first book.  Would recommend it to anyone who loves romance, mystery, time travel and mystical characters.  This book has all of it.  Good strong characters and intriguing plot has you turning the pages as fast as you can read them.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was well written and made me want to read more.  It's not a book that will only be enjoyed by men.
B000M1CN2U|5.0|This was my first Carole King album and I've had a little over a year now. I'm still playing it constantly! I think this is some of her best work. I love all the well-known songs like It's Too Late and So Far Away, but Beautiful is a great song as well. Give it a listen!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As the final volume in this series, it falls short of the initial book.It is \\"ok\\",but could have been better.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|only played 5 minutes and then forced to review. an upgrade purchase was also offered. I'm not sure but I think this is why in game progress was restricted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game. I love it. It is lane of my favorite apps I have on my Kindle Fire. It has amazing. games on it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Starts out with very easy puzzles, but over the &quot;years&quot; it gets more challenging. To those who feel it is too simplistic I would say, You didn't play long enough and you didn't try to match the minimum number of moves.  The music is very Zen, as is the play.  Great game.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love Jack Reacher.  This wasn't the best story, but it's still Jack! He seems to be mellowing a bit, but still getting the job done and getting the bad guys.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was the best I've read all year!  I'm a HUGE Percy Jackson fan so... I love all the books. It's a great book for laughs and a little action.  I can't wait for the next book!!!!!!
1934429821|5.0|we like it. would have been interested to see<br />maybe more about how his business worked, but<br />the endless images of natural beauty and graphic<br />brilliance more than make up for it. I enjoyed reading<br />the interview section as well.
1118026470|2.0|Pains me to write a bad review for a book that has SO much great stuff. Really, it's full to the brim of really great info.<br /><br />But where they went way way wrong: they keep referencing \\"Try it!\\" modules that refer to an online site, where the have different tutorials set up on a virtual server. You're allowed to try the hack techniques against the server for a \\"mere 7 dollars per hour\\".<br /><br />But that's actually really really expensive (if you don't have a company paying for you, hell, even if you do). The online labs are sophisticated, but not THAT sophisticated. The author could have EASILY put them online for free, or run them cheaper. It'll take you HOURS to figure out anything on his labs, unless youre a seasoned pentest guy.<br /><br />it's 7 per hour, and you have to choose 1 hour increments. So I found myself listing things i wanted to try in that hour...which i never got through, because HE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANSWERS, OR A GUIDE! You're supposed to figure it out on the go, which is fine and dandy if youre just browsing a site, but not when youre paying 7 dollars an hour to be on a site.<br /><br />F that...could have done it better/different.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its the most funest game in the world. sweet. and keeps me busy when im bored awesome awesome. awesome awesome
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I first saw this movie on netflix, I watched it because I kept hearing so much about it. When I put it on it was more because I wanted background noise. I ended up glued to the tv because I loved this movie so much. Now here is the kicker, I am 21 years old and I bought the movie for me, not for a child, but for me. It is such a sweet movie I love coming back to on a day I need a smile, I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I was enthralled by this movie. I have become a very late fan of Firefly and was enthusiastically waiting to see this movie. It was exciting and sad but it showed how one must have that desire to continue on despite adverse experiences.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Strange, sad, and heartbreaking!<br /><br />Do we know our  self and how our families effect us?  I guess not. I wanted her to find peace.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|This was an excellent movie!  Kristin Stewart and Charlize Theron did a great job! Not your average Snow White, even my husband enjoyed this one!
1933492279|4.0|Sumptuous images, obviously a very talent artist. Would liked if he had written more about his process rather that the b grade fiction.
B0087HT36U|4.0|A takeoff of the Angry Birds genre of flinging things, but nicely done, good graphics, and addictive. Lots of fun things to fling besides rocks, like flammables!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun for a lazy day.  Easy to understand and play. Pick an angle and drop thecoins.  Watch out for the sides.  I fully recommend.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I'm not generally very objective on reviews of Bob Dylan releases because I have been a big fan since the beginning. This album is a good one. It often takes me many listening sessions to decide if I like an album or not but after three times, I have decided that I like this one. Sure it has dark images but these are dark times. The Titanic ballad is a hoot. Just listen and marvel at the newest addition to a remarkable career.
030758836X|4.0|I've been a Gillian Flynn fan since her first book, Sharp Objects, so I knew I was going to read Gone Girl before it started becoming a word-of-mouth hit. If you haven't read it yet, you need to know three things. One: It is about a marriage that has some problems. (This is a bit of an understatement.) Two: What you think about Nick and Amy will change as you read. Three: Once you get going, you won't be able to stop turning pages. This is a terrifically fun roller-coaster of a read, and I'm glad it is bringing new fans to Ms. Flynn's twisted imagination.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is an amazing book, I had been meaning to read it for years but never got around to it--I wish I had. I actually haven't finished it yet as it is very long 1200 pages but I am going to read mpre of Victor Hugos books now.Highly recommend<br />  Suzanne Marshall
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was anxious to get to the end since i had read reviews and knew I would be pissed when I got there but I didn't expect like this. The book was very good until the ending which to me wasn't a ending at all.  It could have went in so many directions but went no where and as good as the novel was if it was an actual book and not on my kindle I would have thrown it. I would say more and actually analyze what I took from it and the characters but I don' t want to take away from anyone else.I still give it 4 stars because it does keep you engaged.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could give this movie one star. All three batman movies were quality movies and did not have the typical simplistic plot you will find in most superhero movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great app. The pics are decent size to view on your phone. Pinning is easy. And viewing your own boards.
0634022296|5.0|I love the Beatles. I purchased this book about 10 years ago, I removed the spine, took it to Office Max and had them cover and bind it so that the book would lay open when I was using it. It did  not cost that much and was well worth it. I have worn this book out over the years. I left it in my gazebo this past summer and it got wet when it rained hard one day. My wife tried to dry it out with a hair dryer but that just caused it to blow up to twice it's size and pull the pages out of the binding. I was devastated. My beloved Beatles book, gone.<br />  Here I am, 10 years later, just bought it again, and will do the same thing, take it to Office Max and have them re-bind it and cover it (bout 5-10 bucks)(why don't the publishers realize that as players we need it to lay flat!?) Anyway, as almost everyone else say's here, this book is spot on. EXACTLY as the Beatles played it, in the right key's. The people here who say the song's are sometimes not in the right key are wrong. Sure the Beatles used varispeed technology sometimes on their recordings so you may have to tune down or up a semi-tone or use a capo to get it exact, welcome to the real world,(read Geoff Emmerick's book on how the Beatles recorded and experimented) but this book gets it right for a guitarist learning and playing the songs with or without a band,and 99% of the time playing along with the song, the right chords placed perfectly over the words.<br />  I do not read music or tab. This is a CHORD book. No music notation to get in the way, no tab numbers, just chord names with chord pictures where your fingers are placed and the position on the neck. This book has the chords for each song pictured at the top of the page for that song to reference while playing or learning. Every song is laid out so that when you open to a new page laid out flat the whole song fits into those 2 pages that you are looking at, starting on the left page and ending on the right page. No page turning when playing! Perfect! Well thought out practical book for a guitarist. If you like the Beatles and play guitar you have to have this book. It has every song Lennon & McCartney wrote during the Beatles period that they recorded as the Beatles, and every song that George Harrison recorded with the Beatles. It is THE definitive one to have.<br /><br />  Update: The book arrived a few days ago. I got it for $16 (list is $25 which I paid when it came out over 10 years ago) I took it to Office Max last night. It cost me $1.09 for them to cut the binding off and $3.19 to put a new spiral binding on it for a total of $4.65!(including tax) Just over 20 bucks total and I have THE PERFECT Beatles book. They had 2 bindings to choose from, the spiral wire looking binding, and a thicker half inch long type of binding. Go with the thick one. The book lays open perfect now, easy to turn the pages. Get a capo, you will need one to make this book work sometimes, the voicing are great with a capo on and exactly what the record is doing. For those of you criticizing the book read the introductory part in the beginning to explain what the approach was. It is a perfectly logical approach.<br />  I flung the book open last night and George's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" was there, never tried it. Must admit I never thought he was a great player, good but not great. I musta been missin' somthin', cause that song ain't easy! The way the book is written it gives me a path to doing as little or as much as I want with it. The capo @ the 7th fret is a great voicing/tone for the song. Exactly goes along with what was originally done. Get the book. Hope this was helpful. Enjoy!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Typical Lee Child novel..... OUTSTANDING.  I hope Mr. Child continues with his \\"Jack Reacher\\" series.  I have read all of them and waited with much feelings for this one to hit the reader.  As suspected it was worth the wait.  It was suspenseful, full of action, just a typical \\"Reacher\\" story.  I do not have enough words to express my reading fulfillment after reading the novel.  Hard to anticipate what the next story line will be when and if Mr. Childs continues but I know I will be first in line.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the whole transition of 50 and Ana.  Worth reading over and over again.  After I read the 1st book I had to read the 2nd and then had to read the 3rd.  Couldn't put these books down.  It took me a week to read all 3.  LOVE them.  These are the best books I've read in a LONG time.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. I hope the new levels come out soon. Try it yiu won't be disappointed.
B009ARMS1I|3.0|Thought it could of been better plus the little sucks! To much on replacing Rachel which is character that is over rated.
0525953728|5.0|This was a great book .... shows you OBAMA had nothing to do with getting BIN LADEN. It was only the brave SEALS, who were not looking for praise -- unlike that JERK in the White House.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Nice, clean interface. I do think it's a good app. Y'now, you should probs get it. Well worth tha...er.....freeness. Ya.
1878424319|5.0|This is one of the great reads that is not widely popular in the main stream media.  It is quietly past from one person to another for the gem that it is.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|Awesome DVD. If you love Bon Jovi as I do you must see this DVD. It is a collectors item. It is a Fantastic show.<br />Get it and see for your selves.<br />I highly recommend this seller.<br />Sorry, Amazon will not let me copy & Paste this for you.
B008MEM24S|5.0|really enjoy this app. great price. can't wait for new levels!  better than where's my water since this has Perry and Dr Door.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|A great mix of R&B, soul and jazz, soft tones with great rhythms. Gets better every time you listen to it!
B0087HT36U|4.0|this game is a lot of fun make ubreally use ur brain the thing I did not like it is to short and I keep checking tor updates that more level have been added.
0316212377|3.0|Like his most recent works Banks is LONG on exposition and short on coming up with new things for the Culture to do. His action scenes are confusing and there are unnecessary plot lines, with too many extraneous characters.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with this book is that the people act all wrong. In this particular novel the 'Gzilt' are supposed to be subliming and on-par with the Culture technologically but the characters act out of place, like they were written for a different book.  Their motivations were off and didn't make sense.  For instance, why all the political intrigue? What was the point they were all subliming in days?<br /><br />The premise of the book was pretty thin too.  A possible secret irrelevant to the Culture, nearly unverifiable, and ultimately moot.  Basically, imagine writing a spy thriller, with two major countries battling over whether you should tell a 15 year old kid Santa Claus isn't real.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|There were so many words in this book that were not necessary.  I did not like the characters nor the disjointed story.  I was so disappointed in the ending as, after he had wasted all those words, we did not get the story of what happened between 16 yrs old and 60. The book club had only one out of nine that enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game for the kids. variety and easy games!!!!!  something for everylne in the family to enjoy. sets easy goal the kids can accomplish.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|i just love the album. I connect with most of the songs especially tellsomebody remembermynameand touchme. I loved chris brown before only because he was fine and attractive. But this album made me realize how awesome his music is. I will be a fan for life. #Teambreezy I will support him and come to his defense no matter what!

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a good one. I don't often play this type of game more than once, but I will be playing it again in the more challenging mode. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|not sure how I was able to avoid the constant ads everyones been talking about in recent reviews.  I had to redownload mine again after a restore-factory-settings mishap on my kindle fire and I was a little worried about it.  there are videos in addition to the ads but they're all contained to between games.  I really do like this version. ive had about a half dozen different solitaire games and this is by far the best.
B009329Y30|2.0|Love story, usual chick flick. Mediocre acting by Zephron. Predictable story. Fine if you have nothing better to do.like on a long flight.Scenery beautiful, may be redeeming factor..
B008BWFP2W|5.0|This movie presents the lives of some students that struggle to have the life they want in the middle of a wealthy society. They are presented with the options of a hard life doing waitressing or boring jobs getting a pay that does not allow them to build their life, or to render their services to men that are willing to reward them in more ways than money can do. This is a hard thing to present in front of our hard coded values. It is the difference between being exposed to landlords that want to abuse them for no pay, to live in unsafe neighbourhoods or to explore other avenues.  All of this for a woman (Juliette Binoche) that feels neglected by her husband, overwhelmed by her housewife duties and at the same time producing an article for a magazine the famous Elle magazine about students that become call girls. Confronting this reality and her own boredom, frustration and sadness makes her reevaluate her life and her options. The end shows something that maybe is not what we want but many times it becomes what it is. The movie is very well acted and directed and addresses these very difficult topics in a caring way. I may disturb some people as some views may show a reality that some may not want to see.
B008645YEE|5.0|Awesome sound!! i heard it everyday to work and really gets me going? Also, it came before i anticipated, so it was a great surprise!
B009329ZF2|2.0|Not much of a movie, great special effects, dumb ideas, good cast, bad acting across the board by known's and old timers.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This was a ridiculous waste of time. It started out very slow but turned into a gory, bloody mess. Didn't end right. But, how it could it?
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy this version of Solitare especially the auto complete feature. The price was right _ free!!!! I wish I did not have to click off an ad every new game but for free, I will do it!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another typical but still exciting story line. Good amount of red herrings to keep the plot from being predictable. Another great read
B003VANOFY|4.0|I wanted to purchase a good quality wireless headphones for listening to music and/or gaming. I expected top of the line quality hardware and software when i was paying above $150 for this. Unfortunately i am quite disappointed with the overall experience after 1 years of use. Please read on;<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good sound quality<br />it has surround sound.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br />8/27/2016 Update: You can see the deformation of the ear pieces after 5 years of use. This picture should tell you quality and durability of the product itself. After driver updates, wireless interferences issues are mostly gone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not a real 7.1 surround sound device<br />Frequent audio drops, wired or wireless<br />Interference on 2.4 Ghz band with other wireless devices (routers !!)<br />poor software driver quality<br />right channel stops working.<br /><br />First of all this is not a true 7.1 surround sound device, surround sound is generated by software emulation and sent to two drivers. This however doesnt work well all the time. Occasionally sound comes stronger on the right side, unless you restart whatever you are listening. Very same emulation/usb drivers also faults, causes audio disconnects, either when there is another 2.4Ghz band device nearby that interferes or another (usb) device in your PC takes an interrupt precedence and causes a CPU spike. Regarding sound quality, it is ok, but it is not awesome. I have owned a Sony headphone (Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones) that had better sound quality then this device, it has worked 13 years, I am quite sure they were cheaper. As a comparison they had stronger base sound, cleaner and crisper meds and treble than this headphone.<br /><br />Now lets move on to the most annoying problem of this headphones; On Windows 7 64bit, when connected to a USB2 port, including the latest drivers from logitech website (date 8/12/2012), device will randomly disconnect (sound will drop) and connect back again. The problem happens even when it is connected and charging. Originally I have attributed this problem to a driver bug but after updating the drivers over the course of the last year problem has continued to happen. Logitech forums are full of people complaining about the audio drop problem since August 2010. Unfortunately this headphones are using ever crowded 2.4Ghz range, and interfering with wireless routers. There is no way to identify which channel the device functions (it comes receiver/headphones paired to use a 2.4Ghz channel between 1 to 11). If your neighbours router is using the same channel with your headphones, you are out of luck (unless of course you go ask them to change it).<br /><br />I should have returned it instead of waiting for a driver update.<br /><br />In addition when listening to youtube videos, right channel will occasionally stop working. Sound from this headset is pretty weak.<br /><br />This is the second time I am disappointed with Logitech product. My logitech harmony remote's LCD screen (most expensive version again) has also faulted after 1 year of use (w/o any drop). At this point I am not sure whether the company's products are really good quality.<br /><br />I'd say stay away from this headphones, look for something else.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br />Increasing the rating to 4 star after 6 years of functioning with no issue but wear and tear on ear pieces. Bought a new 933 as well. I was harsh critic to this earlier. it is likely my problems were originating from 2.4 ghz interference from another devicerging.

B0086700CM|4.0|honestly its a good game I'm just happy its free I like it and all but I wouldn't pay for it
B00004RF97|5.0|I bought this movie from Amazon for the second time after losing my first copy. It is a classic movie with timeless and tasteful humor. I would recommend it for all ages and definitely for those looking for a change from today's witless comedies.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Great movie!!  Just like we remember it.  It's been awhile since we saw the movie.  My husband loves the old movies from when we were younger.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has the gift of sharing history in a \\"can't put it down\\" format.  He intertwines the main characters across generations with surprises around every corner.  The subplots are revealed through the daily lives of the main characters and history unfolds.  The only drawback is that now I can't wait for the third segment of the trilogy to appear!
B0096HKZ1M|5.0|Re-Animator follows Herbert West and his new roommate as they re-animate the dead. Obviously the plot is a lot deeper than that, but the less you know, the better the viewing experience. Re-Animator brilliantly blends SciFi, Horror, and Dark Humor to create an extremely entertaining film. The SciFi comes from the science behind the re-animation and bypassing brain death. The Horror comes from the terrifying results of the experiments; whether it was a dead animal or dead person, it's a chilling idea. The dark humor comes from the witty dialogue, the explosive gore, and the unexpected antics. The effects are amazing, and better than some movies released recently. The ending was intense and I thought the final escape was shot beautifully. The \\"Psycho\\"-style music was a nice touch. Megan's nosy actions were a bit annoying, but not enough to significantly affect the film.<br /><br />Overall, Re-Animator is an amazing film experience. As of 10/7/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, but a purchase is highly recommended.<br /><br />Re-Animator has very strong violence and gore, and full nudity (male and female, usually re-animated bodies except for Megan)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Kept my attention.... A must read after The Huger Games. Answered question raised from book one. Wow! Wow!

B008N1V11U|5.0|If you are an avid gamer or look for something that is a little challenging yet has spectacular graphics this is the game to get. Gameloft has outperformed itself with The Dark Knight Rises and offers a great gaming experience as well as a slightly new view of the storyline as Batman attempts to fight evil and recover from his past. I would tell anyone to not worry about the price of the game but rather enjoy the experience. There are very few games like this that offer exceptional game play like this does. If my little review hasn't perked your interest maybe this short list of what you can do just might entice you a little more. For instance, you can glide with your bat cap through town, use your grappling hook to scale tall buildings and even pull your enemies closer, do an assortment of fight movies and even counter attacks, ride the batcycle and more. This is a fantastic game based on a fantastic movie.
B000TERDJS|5.0|Clearly Eno knew what he was doing.  Originally composed to address the problem of non-conducive music in the airport, Eno sought to create music that was soothing and did not interfere with conversation.  With a bunch of enourmous tape loops he did just that; this music is perfect for anyone looking to create a calm environment for human conversation.<br /><br />Often when I am in the car, or just about any place else, listening to music, I find us talking over the music.  This is a clear indication to switch from whatever is playing to Music for Airports.<br /><br />This composition should be an indispensible addition to everyones collection, and while I emphasize its function, one does not need any particular reason to enjoy this celestial music.<br /><br />-Norbu Tashi Ogyen Nyima
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book. I'm already reading for a 2nd time! Would recommend everyone read this trilogy! Feel like the characters are real people. E L James is a fantastic author.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Got this book as my first on my Kindle, and 24 hours later, I finished it sleep-deprived and satisfied. One of the best books I've read in a long time and the classic video game references make me squeal. An amazing read, and highly recommended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I was happy and sad and emotional and romantic all wrapped into one amazing book! I really hope she continues their story because I can't wait to know where they go from the end.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in You is the second book in the Crossfire trilogy by Sylvia Day. Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell's romance picks up exactly where the first book, Bared to You, left off. Gideon Cross is one of the top twenty-five richest people in the fictional world. Eva Tramell is a new hire in an office located in Cross Industries, and Gideon's girlfiend of one month.<br /><br />This is the most dysfunctional, mucked-up couple ever. But I love them! They are addicted to each others presence, touch, desire and thoughts. Both characters are seriously flawed with troubled pasts. Both characters are sexual abuse survivors; their intense passion and jealousy creates a unique romance. What other couple do you know admits to being seriously broken and seeks couples therapy? I'll wait. No one? Didn't think so. This is one of the many reasons why Gideon and Eva belong with each other.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's relationship may not have progressed much, but my opinion sure has. This is not just a Fifty Shades ripoff. It's different. It's addictive in its own way. Their damaged roller coaster romance is erotic, jaw-dropping and mind-boggling. Both of them are complex and remain a mystery to me. The first two books just scratched the surface so I cannot wait for the final book in the Crossfire series, Entwined with You. Hopefully Gideon and Eva have a happy, healthy ending.<br /><br />I recommend this erotic romance series. Give it a try and most likely, you will not put the book down until the last page is turned.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
B008GOG98Y|3.0|Decent movie with a young Dennis Quaid as well as a couple of other big names. The movie is a bit dated, but still enjoyable to watch.
0525953728|5.0|I have a new found respect for the Navy Seals. I have always held them in high esteem, but after reading this book I can only say how truly great and brave these men are.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I love this product just for the fact that I can now let my kids on the computer to do their homework when I'm not home, but I can still monitor what they do!
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I was sadly disappointed. I couldn't wait for the book to be released and expected to pick up from the last one. I was disappointed that it picks up from an incident that happens in the first book and just gives more details. I wanted more.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A brilliant game. Uses reasoning skills. Beautifully made. However, has lost saved data when updating. Glad I got this as a free app of the day, but it's definitely worth paying for. It's a healthy addiction.
B0041VB8BO|5.0|A lovely listen, can easily put the disc in and let it run from start to finish. Or rather push play at the beginning of my mp3 playlist in my Amazon MP3 Player and let it run to the end.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher is more brain than muscle in this one, but still Lee Child is all through the book. For me, I like the unknown, mystery parts so I can try to figure out the various plots etc. Then I can't wait to see if my thinking concurs with Reachers. Of course Reachers physical activity keeps things going and I like the way Lee Child leads up to that stuff.
B009LH1WLO|5.0|Review contains light spoilers.<br /><br />After some of the missteps of the last couple of season of Supernatural, I had my worries about what a new season would bring, but if the rest of Season 8 lives up to the premier, my worries will have been in vain. I loved the opening and the set-up of the season long arcs and the introduction of new characters.<br /><br />When we left Sam and Dean at the end of Season 7, Dean was in Purgatory and Cas had just disappeared, Kevin, the new prophet had been kidnapped by the always delightful Crowley, Bobby's soul had been set free in death and Sam was left all alone to find Dean, save Kevin and fight the Leviathons. It turns out that Sam did none of those things, a character choice that is sure to be controversial but that has some roots in past behavior and plots. Dean it seems may have been a very bad boy in Purgatory, a place he nicknamed Pure, no doubt because of the purity of the intent to survive that is necessary. It seems that in Purgatory, upon the disappearance of Cas, Dean teamed with a sexy, Southern vampire named Benny. Cas is dead or close enough to it to make no difference according to Dean and this forms the first mystery. Just what did happen to Cas and how did Dean get out of Pure? The viewer gets tantalizing glimpses of Dean and Benny's time in Purgatory via flashback.<br /><br />Kevin has grown a lot in the last year mostly because necessity is the mother of invention and desperation is the father of survival. Kevin was kidnapped by Crowley and shown another tablet to translate. How he escaped Crowley and begged Sam for help is also shown in flashback.<br /><br />Women, as always fare badly in the Supernatural universe with one death and one desertion in the first episode alone, but this seems to be the norm for Supernatural. Geekboys have no idea how to write realistic women or realistic relationships with women whether romantic or platonic, they can only do fantasy wish fulfillment (Dean's overwhemlming number of notches on his belt) or idealization of dead women (mom, Jessica, Meg, Jo, etc. etc. etc, the list is far too long) but idealization of dead women was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, arguably one of the first nerd writers of the supernatural and fantastic so I suppose the writers are in good company here.<br /><br />All in all a great set-up to the season, including the character controversy and I look forward to see where the writers are going to take it.<br /><br />One last footnote, the Leviathan, those monsters whose weakness is a Victorian bug killer, are around but don't seem like they will be a focus for the season. Supernatural fans should check this out with no worries and newbies should start with the first season and catch-up. Recommended to fans of sci-fi and urban fantasy.umber of notches on his belt) or idealization of dead women (mom, Jessica, Meg, Jo, etc. etc. etc, the list is far too long) but idealization of dead women was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, arguably one of the first nerd writers of the supernatural and fantastic so I suppose the writers are in good company here.<br /><br />All in all a great set-up to the season, including the character controversy and I look forward to see where the writers are going to take it.<br /><br />One last footnote, the Leviathan, those monsters whose weakness is a Victorian bug killer, are around but don't seem like they will be a focus for the season.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|Well, Oxford is always one of the best...I have no more word to say...except that i am very satisfied with this surprise.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great game - one of the best adventure games ever. The rights levels of difficulty, right mix of puzzles, appropriate help features, etc. The only thing &quot;negative&quot; is that it is virtually impossible to put down. Great job guys!!!
B000JMKO3C|3.0|i knew that the author must have lives the experience in the book  . after reading it  yes he did in life.
0525953728|5.0|I just finished this book in under 24 hours, and it was a thrilling, tense read.  It describes the career and some life snippets of a SEAL who was in the final team that killed Bin Laden.<br />The first thing I note when compared with the news reports is just how close things were: there were many opportunities for things to go haywire. The chopper dropping the first team nearly fell, and countless other incidents that nearly made the mission fail or endanger the lives of those involved.<br /><br />Also, I get a sense of how selfless the man in the book is.  Far from the money-grubbing opportunist that many news reports make him out to be, he writes with respect towards the men and women he served with.  After reading the book and watching the interview on 60 Minutes, I come away very much impressed with this man (who it turns out is my age).  I want to shake his hand, but I realize that he would prefer just to go to work and live his life without any further attention.<br /><br />The book itself is a very thrilling read, despite knowing the outcome.  The details of the operation (what few there were) fascinated me, and prevented me from putting the book down. There are few thrillers that grip me this way.  I guess there is poignancy in the fact that many of these events occurred and I am familiar with them in the news.<br /><br />News reports that attacked his character, or questioned his motives for writing the book.  In the end, I deem them to be false for two main reasons.<br />First, as he reports in his book, he is donating most of the profits to several foundations that he recommends at the end. This is actually a shame. There are several idiots in the NFL who probably train less, and take fewer tryouts than these men, who get *fined* more than this guy would have made from the proceeds.  Are we to rank the author less than a person like Michael Vick? I would have rather him enjoying some of the profits and using them with his family.<br />Second, there is noboasting at all. For a guy who would have plenty of opportunities to toot his own horn, there was no where at all in the 300+ page book that he does this.  None.  He is always making reference to the hard work of *others*.  I will never meet this guy, but I can feel fairly confident that this is a person who at least deserves my respect.<br /><br />Few books offer a good read and a worthy cause.  Here you get both, and for those reasons alone, I think this is an easy purchase.<br />Recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a smaller version of Pioneer trail on Facebook.  You can have friends but added benefit is that you do not need them.  You can build the items you need. Only problem is that the fishing does not seem to work correctly so you cannot complete that mission.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Where to begin?  Very well cast....very well directed with flashes of sly humor and gentle poking at the superhero genre.  Not one of the heroes is perfect and that works because of the conflict it offers. Great villain too.  Loki is just such a pompous ass. It's great when Hulk gets his hands on him.  Just a whole lot of fun.<br />Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|As a confirmed Corellian, I gave this album to a good friend, a violinist. However, he is practicing the \\"Four Seasons\\" right now, and the Corelli, remains unopened on his studio desk. Corelli's music, in my humble dogma, is better-written, more elegant and more charming than Vivaldi's.  So put down that fiddle already, and treat yourself, and Moi!  -- Conrad Susa

0307744434|4.0|Beautifully written and undeniably magical, this book intrigued me from the first page. If Ray Bradbury and Alice Hoffman had collaborated on a novel (with a conference with Stephen King), they would have written something like this. I would have given the book 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it rambled aimlessly in places and could have been edited down a bit. I also think it lacked direction in places, and didn't make a strong point at the end. But the writing was pretty enough to charm me, even when it didn't go anywhere. -- Cindy La Ferle

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was most captivating novel I have read this year. Flynn spins a tale, that at first seems to be the predictable story we've all read or seen in a movie; but then provides you with a jaw dropping surprise.<br /><br />Her clever quips and very real character admissions make you laugh out loud ( like I did, on the subway) or nod your head and say, \\"Yeah that's how it is.\\" She uses cliches, but quickly pokes fun at them before you roll your eyes.<br /><br />He vision of a crumbling marriage, insecurity and insanity are extremely captivating.<br />If you like a suspense, mystery and real life drama, this is the book for you.
0525952926|5.0|Amazing book, have not been able to put it down, do not want it to ever end. The details, the facts, and  all the characters, intertwined throughtout the years. I stand in awe of such magicial writing. Thank you Ken Follett for so many hours of complete joy.<br />  Annette Morgenroth
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow! With that one word that simply says it all. I didn't think it was possible to love Gideon anymore than I had in Bared to You but Ms. Day proved me completely wrong. I couldn't put this down and devoured it in 8 hours (between sleep/work). What a fantastic follow-up, very riveting and certainly not predictable. I highly recommend this and can't wait for the 3rd book.

B0015KGJMM|5.0|Amazon (see above) quotes from three reviews including that by ClassicalMusicLover (see below) who has given the Alia Vox issue 4.5 stars and compared it favorably with two other SACD recordings.  With reference to an alternative recording by L'Art Dell Arco on CPO, ClassicalMusicLover concluded that \\"This performance [i.e. by L'Art Dell Arco] is good but again the recording engineers have ruined this SACD by choosing an acoustically dead venue to record in!\\"  Someone at Amazon, in error, has repeated this excerpt as if it were referring to the Alia Vox issue.<br /><br />Whereas, with reference to the Alia Vox issue, ClassicalMusicLover wrote: \\"Thank God Jordi Savall's recording was made in the acoustically rich sounding Chateau de Cardona and Jordi's group gives a passionate performance.\\"<br /><br />I bought the Alia Vox issue from Amazon UK.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have tried several earbuds that claim they stay inside the ear while running, but none of them have truly lived up to it.  This time, I decided to go with an over-the-head style because I knew they'd stay put during my runs.  These headphones obviously stay in the ear, but they are also not bulky.  I have dark hair, and so it barely looks like I'm even wearing these headphones.  The sound quality is fantastic!  I plugged them in to my ipod and the volume was set quite high from before when I was using the factory ipod earbuds.  With these, the sound is so good that I could bring the volume to mid level and it was crisp and loud enough.  I'm not picky with audio quality, so I can't vouch for that except to say that it is comparable/better than the ipod issued buds.<br /><br />They are definitely extremely lightweight, and the part that fits into your ear is also very unobtrusive.  I'm sensitive with my ears and it didn't feel annoying, heavy, or uncomfortable.  I am so glad with this purchase - and thank the other reviewers for helping to make that decision!  It arrived very quickly, too!
B00632HWOG|5.0|On computer must sign in, assure them I am not \\"feeling geeky\\",request help to acess my mail, then try to get actual messages out of \\"spam file\\".  Amazon app just gives me my mail and lets me read it. Easy to delete after I've read it as well.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A delightful & insightful take on aging, outlook, & preconceived notions. Climb out the window with this old geezer & discover what it really means to be alive.
B000089RV6|5.0|Hunted for this CD in every store and wasn't able to find it.  Ordered from here and was perfect. new, sealed in original case very pleased
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it ALL the time! I love it! I def recommend it! You can look at thousands of different pictures of anything you want. You can &quot;pin&quot; them to your board and view them as often as you like and others can see what you've &quot;pinned&quot; as well. Love love love it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It works great for my needs!  Have had no problems to date.  As far as I can tell, it's usually accurate.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|It exceeded my expectations the picture quality on Blu Ray is outstanding. The sound all of it make you feel as if your almost there. The Barn Scene in that perfect quality seemed even more intense. Some people say Blu Ray is not all that I disagree I think the quality is much better in both picture and sound. Something TV seems to loose unless your watching it in HD. This show is something I have been waiting for....for a very long time. Something about what people do and how they react to a plague like a Zombie outbreak...or Walker outbreak. It's fascinating to me how this show captures more than what Romero could do on the crappy budgets that Hollywood stuck him with....when the man is the God of Zombie horror. This show as it goes along gives us more depth into how we really are and what we are capable of. In the end we only have to realize this is a plague..zombies are like fleas from rats during the Black Death that wiped out millions in the early 1330's. Some people I have encountered contend Zombies are from Hell. I always reply God nor the Devil had no hand in this...Zombies are disease carriers and carry their disease from one person to the next this is only evolution... primal instinct to feed and spread. After all our own history talks of events in which the living ate the dead to survive this is just the reverse. This show has only begun it's greatness for charters and plots I have a feeling what we have seen so far in Season 1 and 2 is only the tip of the iceberg. If your a fan I highly recommend you buy this and add it to your collection. This show can only get better!!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Classic Jack Reacher! I've read all of Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" books and this was classic Reacher style. I purchased it in Kindle format.
B002R88G4U|5.0|The book was un-put-down-able. Vivid characters, interesting writing style, touching stories. I read this book for my monthly book club, and I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Quirky alien meets nerdy guys from UK!  Excellent match-up!  Simon Peg and Nick Frost pull off another very entertaining performance... as did \\"Paul\\" in his movie making debute.  Love it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As normal it keeps one on the edge of thier seats, takes one through the most harrowing time of recent history and brings them out, not always the same as they went into it. Makes one wish the next book was coming out soon.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|This app would be lovely, if I could do anything with my photos.  Everytime I tried to share a photo on Facebook or Twitter I get a message saying it failed.  This app is pretty much pointless without the ability to share your photos.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This is one of the most talked about books in years. And I guess that must be the erotic elements - it is certainly not for its literary worth. I only bought this because I had to see what the hype was about. I finally caved in a I was sitting in a restaurant in Spain with my friend and some guys at the table next to us struck up a conversation about this. Bizarre phenomenon. Having finally caved in I was pretty determined not to like it and the first bit confirmed this. But it grows on you. It has too much sex, but maybe this is expected in what after all is a pornographic work. Calling it erotica is sugar coating. Its like a XXX movie. However, I like regency romances on occassion and actually this is not dissimilar in construct. The rich, tortured rake falling for the poor, pure but beautiful and mesmerising girl. Be warned though this is only part 1 so not complete by itself. I ended up on three stars simply because I did finish it and it has its moments. I liked the email exchanges, there is some wit which saves it from being utter drivel. I still do not understand its fame. I guess we are all mesmerised by what we see as somewhat deviant sexual behaviour. Its a bit like watching those bizarre subjects of documentaries such as Louis Theroux. We are shocked but entertained. I cannot recommend you read this for it really is not that great, but if you want to have random book discussions with strangers  then away you go. Its also being used as a pick up tool, although being a vanilla girl that might warn me of the person! At any rate, if you do meet someone who raves about this then I would take that as code for &#34;willing or eager to try some S&M&#34;. So now you don't have to read it to decode!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the best app I have purchased and worth every cent. Great graphics, hidden object puzzles, many objectives to complete, and mystery make for hours of entertainment. Its not too short either. I am anxiously awaiting part 2!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all the Lee Child - Jack Reacher books.  This one was no exception to a very interesting and great book. I often find my self rushing through the book because I can't wait to see what happens next and then I am disappointed to get to the end too soon!  I love the Jack Reacher books and adventures.  Please keep them coming!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|As the title says - simple but fun - more than worth the zero cents I paid for it.  Go for it, what do you have to lose?
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Great! This is fun read with plenty of mystery and humor and romance. I loved reading about Charles and Sophia! The only bad thing is now I have to wait for the next book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was one of the best books I have read in along time.... Couldn't wait to start the next book..... I really hope that she continues the series..... it left you wanting more
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I liked this paranormal romance because the romance really supported the story instead of a forced romance with a thin plot like other paranormal romances. This story has a lot of action and a fast paced plot. I couldn't put it down!
B0058YPL66|5.0|A great series! It's makes a nice change from all the forensic cop shows. Bringing to life the characters from your childhood storybooks but with an adult twist.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I down loaded this book from Amazon.com for my Kindle Fire. Pager turner from start to finish. Lots of drama.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album is awesome. It is really chill, but still passionate and driven. The lyrics are very bold and interesting.
B0082GQ5HG|4.0|I recently found out that my Grand Niece in California was into pirates instead of princesses like most 4 year olds I have met before. Her mom said they have already watched multiple times.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The only negative thing I have to say is you cant fast forward through the beginning credits or walk through of video like you can on most DVD's but its only like 3 minutes so I turn it on an let it play while I get my shoes on and get some water ect.... This is a GREAT DVD and I love to work out! There are 3 levels start with one and work your way to three. She explains the move really well and they are so super easy and you still feel it in every muscle!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Got this for free! A mini-vacation for your mind! I really like playing it, it works flawlessly. You should get it and tap your screen to win!
B008Y2IU12|4.0|This was a really awesome movie.  I didn't quite know what to expect in the beginning but it was well worth the screening.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story, action, special effects and buttery popcorn and a dill pickle.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is one of the best games I have played in a long time.  very enjoyable and very frustrating when I run out of energy.  totally addicting.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it is very similar to iphone's battery app.  its handy and practical.  good product and its free.  cant beat that.
B009AHWM5A|5.0|Honestly, if you're a fan of the RE saga's then you will most likely give this a 4-5 star rating.<br /><br />I feel like these movies are made for fans, but you can still enjoy and appreciate the animation and story by just watching. You get classic RE feel. New characters you'll find yourself attaching to quickly and a refreshing looking territory! You're in Russia here. More so then the last movie ( Degeneration ) this movie can make you seriously feel like you're watching all the cut scenes of a video game in HD all put together.<br /><br />Fans will enjoy this, people who havent played the games will enjoy it with the exception of of not knowing some of the references being said.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I downloaded this book for an international trip and didn't put it down the entire flight. Love the plot twists and turns.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Nice job Diana! I like it. Although I LOVE your other discs I think this is a nice change-up from you're other works, a little swing, maybe some rockabilly? Shows great taste and creativity IMHO. Take the blinders off people and enjoy this CD!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|**MILD SPOILERS...MAYBE?** So, the hand-picked cream of the crop of Earth's scientists and technicians, paid for by an anal-retentive, paranoid and very very rich man makes up the crew of arguably the only cool thing in the movie (the ship Prometheus).<br /><br />Yet when these creme-de-la-creme people encounter basically what each of their career fields would call the motherlode of all time, they act like freshmen in an introductory (or possibly remedial) chemistry class.  The touch everything, they poke everything, they act surprised when things hurt or don't do what they expect, they test things that they *know* are probably dangerous and definitely \\"alien\\" in the sense that they have never, ever seen anything like it before, and they test it in an open room with gloves and gowns on...well, some of them.  They all deserved to pay the price for their obvious lack of, or abandonment of, their top-notch training.  These characters are so wholly unbelievable that after 20 minutes I couldn't care less if they all lived or died, and was hoping some would die painfully just to be reminded that \\"touching substances you've never encountered before may be hazardous to your health\\".  Oh and hey let's split up the first few hours we're here and leave behind a guy who has already been saying he doesn't like it here along with another scientist who doesn't use any basic high-school level safety methods.  That won't end badly at all, right?  And the head scientist, the one who wanted this trip like no one's business, doesn't bother to tell anyone when he knows there's maybe something wrong with him and maybe quarantine and a medical exam might be a good idea.  If these are the best money can buy on Earth, then Earth must be living in an Idiocracy.<br /><br />Wow, what a joke.  Even the android's reasoning for it's callous and traitorous acts doesn't make sense.  No-one's actions make sense, except maybe once when Charlize tried to prevent someone from getting on the ship.  That's pretty much it.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the worst \\"there's no escaping this one\\" moment ever...even the guys at Penny Arcade figured out the answer!<br /><br />Idris Elba must have been bored or needed money, because he phoned in his part here...granted he wasn't given much material to work with.  Theron was more mechanical than the mechanical man.  Fassbender performed well (one reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) but again had poor material to work with.  The whole medical scene with Rapace was just ludicrous and may as well have been in a \\"how not to perform surgery in any century\\" how-to vid.  I guess Scott just wanted a gory visual to break up the terribly fragmented logic of the \\"story\\".<br /><br />Instant and unexplained aggression from the engineer, with no rationale or justification beyond \\"let's wrap this thing up and set up the ending\\".<br /><br />As usual Scott takes us on a visual 13-course feast, but the story just doesn't make the ride worth it.  The opening scene set up so much promise, which was then flushed away to a hack job of writing and continuity.<br /><br />Waste of money at the theatre, and waste of money here.  Really a shame.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Redemption and compassion rule this Clint Eastwood movie.  I liked that his character broadens his views to see people as they are and when he recognizes the pathos of the gang situation and his new friends, he chooses a path to make the ending of his life worth something.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I felt that this book was a bit \\"flowery\\".  So far from what most foster home kids would be into that it was hard to swallow.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Always enjoy Steven's work! His books are hard to put down. This story captured my interest very quickly, and ended very sweetly.
B00005JKG9|5.0|A...B...C...Always be closing.  ALWAYS be CLOSING.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater 11 times when it came out in 1992.  Yes, I loved it that much then and still do today.  The depth of the characters, the believable drama, memorable dialogue and the awesome performances by Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and most of all - Alec Baldwin (You see this watch...you see this watch? This watch costs more than your car).  Jack Lemmon shines above all in this movie as Shelly \\"The Machine\\" Levine.  I never thought he was that much of an actor until this film and he proves me wrong by SHINING in this role.<br /><br />They need to release this movie on Blu-ray.
B008D28HYS|2.0|If you like logic puzzles, this is a great game.  A few levels in to the game, I started to notice I was getting a lot of puzzles wrong and redoing them thinking it was me.  It was not.  There are errors in many of the puzzles after the first level.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I started with Jack Reacher #1 and am now up to #12. Liked this one the best!!! Getting to know the character better.
B009329Y30|2.0|After reading \\"The Lucky One\\" by Nicholas Sparks, I was anxious to watch the movie.  Now, I know that there is only so much that can be depicted from a book in an hour and forty minute movie, but this movie left out a lot of pivotal details. First, the picture Thibault finds while on duty in Iraq plays a larger role in the book. Thibault struggles with when and how to tell Beth about the picture, and the book is able to go into a lot more detail about why the photograph is considered to be lucky. Thibault even struggles with believing that the picture is lucky; it was his best friend Victor who had told Thibault that he was indebted to the woman in the picture and that it was his destiny to find her. In the movie, Victors character is not very well explained at all. Also, Zeus, the German Shepard, was an important character in the book, even (Spoiler Alert) saving Ben's life from the Flooded river at the end of the book. In the book, Ben survives for two reasons: a) he is pulled out of the water by the dog, and b) Thibault had given him the picture of his mom that he had carried with him in Iraq for 5 years to \\"keep Ben safe.\\"  None of these critical parts were included in the movie, which made it feel empty to me. I'm not even sure I would even be able to tell you the meaning of the title, \\"The Lucky One\\" if I had not read the book first. Sparks saw great success in translating \\"The Notebook\\" to the big screen, but in order for these \\"based on the book\\" movies to be more powerful, more careful consideration should be given when selecting which details from the book are included in the movie before adding irrelevant scenes that are not even depicted in the book. (The scene at the beginning of the movie where Thibault displays some post traumatic stress symptoms at his house in Colorado isn't even in the book. Movie should have inserted Victor's character meaning here instead.) overall, if you loved the book, don't waste your time on the movie. It doesn't even try tobe the same story.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Read the first book of the trilogy purely out of curiosity.  Aside from the steamy sex scenes, I found it very weak in terms of both content and form.  I know plenty of women who love these books though and was told that the story line improves during Book 2 and 3.  I should have followed my gut and stopped after Book 1.  Even the sex started to bore me.  Let's be real:  no one has that much energy.  Not a fan.
B000YABS8E|5.0|This movie is one of my classic favorites. Anytime I say \\"write that down\\", I think of it.  It is funny, a little romantic and hopeful.  Sure, it follows the regular recipe for romantic comedy, but the twist adds to the fun and the cast can't be beat!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Probably doesn't compare to the imagination and the book, however the movie was good in my opinion. You barely feel the 2+ hours of duration, and it does leave you hungering for the next installment.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|The BEST video player for Android now on Kindle Fire! Have always used it on my other phones and tablets. Works great!
B00932A4XE|4.0|Good Movie w/ funny and emotional moments that made for an overall \\"Good Time\\". The overall cast pulls it off, and is a wonderful distraction. As a parent this is almost dead on to my day to day escapades.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Loved it, a great book that I couldnt put down until I finished. At last the truth about what a gutless snake UBL is, I hope most of his mindless followers read this book and realise they are fighting a losing cause.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Awesome idea and great execution, really makes you think about how structures distribute force, fun and challenging at the same time
B000FC1HBY|5.0|So far I like the series...just started book three...the best thing I like is the way you get drawn into the lives of the characters...some you like and some you don't like...
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. It requires you to concentrate and be able to do simple addition of number pairs from 0 - 9 in your head. It has a soundtrack but no option for muting it, which is why I gave it 4 stars and not five. The only way I have found to mute the game is to adjust the media volume of my smartphone.
B0098VXCR0|2.0|Brainless story and wooden acting from all except Charlize Theron. You all know the classic story's foundation. This movie asks us to believe that Kristen Stewart is the prettiest in the land?? I don't know about you, but I was routing for the huntsman to kill her even before he actually came on to the screen. The girl simply...cannot...act. The Twilight movies should have given that impression loud and clear, and although I had some hope b/c there actually are good actors (Theron/Bob Hoskins/Ian MacShane), this movie flat out stunk.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|When I first heard this band, they blew me away.  Then, I saw them in concert, and now I can't get enough of them.  I have all their CD's and DVD, and I bought \\"The Whippoorwill\\" as soon as it was released.  This is their best musice yet.  I remembered a couple of the songs from their concert.  This CD seems to have more ballads and keyboard music.  Charlie Star and the guys can do it all, and this CD is now my favorite of all times.  Keep it coming...........
0805095535|4.0|Auster talks about himself, with a style often hard to understand, but never obvious.<br />The arguments are several, the principal is the sexuality, and also the descriptions have a their strong efficacy.<br />But the use of the word is characteristic of Auster, the words are cold, passing through the able hands of the author, who studies the better way to hit the mind of which reads.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book given that it has been talked about so much as a must read.  I did not think it was particularly well written but I was hooked to find out what happened to Amy.  In the beginning the story was clever with Amy spending so many years setting up her husband Nick but then the story started to get too convulted. In reality no one could do all that Amy did, then change the facts to say  she meant something else to finally getting away with murder after only a 4 hour grill from the police.  And the ending was just dumb.  I wanted some justice for one of the characters.  It was as if the author got tired of all her ideas and was getting mixed up and then just gave up with the ending.  I would not likely even read any more books by this author.
0374203032|4.0|The author has given to this book a good title, because it means that it exists many things whom have a value not only related to the money.<br />Sandel talks longer about the role of the market, and it is important the possibility to substain social policies for a true developping.<br />The interests of big industries shouldn't superate certain limits: the pollution, the corruption, the healt are particular issues whom need the attention of politics.<br />The style is always elegant, and the lecture goes away speedy.
160094048X|5.0|Have a little less guilt, bake vegan!  I tried the chocolate fudgy oatmeal recipe first because I had all the ingredients. I just feel so much better baking vegan, and from my experience with The Post Punk Kitchen baking recipes, they are all fail-proof!  Just be sure to keep a healthy stock of soy or almond milk and flax seeds in your pantry and you're pretty much good to go.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|If you only have one cd or mp3 by Enya, this should be it. Great hit selection and sound. Love it!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child does it again.  Jack Reacher can find trouble wherever he goes. Love his way-out plots.  Good weekend read.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|This is like a children's story:  Spoilers Alert!<br />Once upon a time there was a master who had 4 superheros under his wing.  One was a long-haired knight from galaxy far far away who weilded a hammer.  One had a round metal shield and dressed in American flag.  One put on his armor and  he could fly.  Last but not least was a man who turned into a green giant when he got angry.  In addition, there were two naughty ones, a man used bow and arrow and a young lady who could fight off a bunch of bad guys.  The long hair knight had a bad brother who wanted to destroy the world with a space ship filled with mean metal dragons.  To save the world, the master called upon the superheros to fight off the attack of metal dragons with the help of the naughty ones.  And the superheros won!<br /><br />Seriously, Joss Wheldon made a smart and entertaining blockbuster with the help of a group of engaging film superstars.  The film sags a bit in the first hour.  The spaceship and the metal dragons are nothing new.  The action sequences are okayly executed.<br /><br />After the dust settled, it is just another movie about superheros.
B00846REIS|5.0|Kept me intrigued and entertained. Finished within 2 days. 50 Shades Fan? Order this book now! Easy reading - great beach book.
B003N9ASEI|4.0|There are probably a handful of great films about American youth.  \\"American Graffiti\\", \\"Animal House\\", \\"Fast Time at Ridgemount High\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" to name a few, not counting John Hughes' movies.<br /><br />This was National Lampoon's first movie and it remains its best.  It has all the right ingredients, a great script (with improvisations), a great director John Landis, a great cast,  including the immortal John Belushi, hilarious set pieces(now simmer down a bit), shocking subject matters at the time(expletives,  sex and drugs) and the \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips!\\"-like soundtrack by the great Elmer Bernstein.<br /><br />If you are from that period(70's), it remains a comedy classic.  If not, it is a time capsule of the youth comedy of the late 70's worthwhile to experience.<br /><br />A good quality blu-ray and don't miss \\"The Yearbook: The Animal House Reunion\\" and \\"Where Are They Now\\" from the Special Features.
0345803507|5.0|Wow...sensual, exciting and a very easy read! I could NOT put the books down. I originally only bought the first Shades of Grey and was so disappointed when I got to the end and I did not have the next 2 books to complete the series. I ordered them from Amazon and finished reading both books within a week. Thanks E. L. James!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This latest Reacher book doesn't hold up to the previous editions.  It almost seems like it was a different writer.  What a let down.
0738711500|5.0|The book and poster of where the cards are placed are very helpful. They made it easier for a beginner to learn how to read the cards.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Satisfying Reacher tale, with good suspense.  I'm not sure I understood the whole denouement, but maybe that's what Child had in mind.<br /><br />Had the usual hooks, burnt body in car, etc. but well used as part of plot.<br /><br />Not as good as \\"To Die For\\" if you are recommending this author to a friend.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It was amazing make sure you buy this product on blu ray or dvd you will not be disappointed i was so impressed with this movie and im sure everyone else is too
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was very shoking every thing that hapend was now expexted i recomend it to everyone wow sow wow
0393316041|5.0|My boyfriend, who NEVER reads, is gobbling this book up! Its made up of short stories, mostly about how science and Feynman's knowledge have created funny instances is his life.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Although the movie versoin of the book was great, reading the book series was so much better.  If you didn't read the books the movie is great.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its fun and u have a whole bunch of gadgets and stuff to buy. I love the lil stiller and Mr.curdles the dragon
B004GBIE3Y|2.0|This movie was pointless, and I really don't remember laughing at any of it. My friend and I had heard that it was funny, so we decided to watch it, it was such a waste of time, and I would not recommend that anyone waste their time watching it.
B0098VXN2Y|5.0|Great transitions between multiple plot lines!<br />True. Hilarious. Entertaining.<br />Great movie, not just a chick flick!<br />So refreshing, Heigl isn't in it.<br />Great mimics of real life.
B004UPAN6W|5.0|Fantastic story and action. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine. Well worth an HD Rental, and a must for anyone into the Comic Book Movie genre.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Stardust was a surprisingly wonderful film that I only watched out of boredom---boy was I surprised to find such a wonderful movie had escaped my sights!!!  Wonderful acting, great fanciful story and a fantastic ending!!!  DeNiro was absolutely funny and lovable.  Please do not miss a chance to see this film, you will be extremely amazed at what it has to offer!!!
0525478817|5.0|I have to begin this review by admitting that I do not read \\"young adult\\" books very often.  As a matter of fact, I avoid them.  I watch 14 year olds and their drama every single day, I do not want to come home and read about more teenage angst.  But one evening, when I was desperately searching for a new book for my Kindle (yes, I panic when I don't have a next book lined up), The Fault in Our Starsby John Green popped up.  I seriously hesitated, but it had such good reviews, I decided to wave my doubts.<br /><br />Oh.  My.  Gosh.  I loved this book from the very first page.  I don't know what makes it \\"Young Adult\\" other than the fact that it is about teenagers.  The writing is outstanding.  The storyline sad, but presented with humor.<br /><br />The main character is Hazel.  Hazel is 16 and has terminal cancer.  While at a cancer support group, she meets Agustus Waters.  They fall in love.  Simple enough plot line, but made oh-so-incredible by the beauty of the writing.  I had to keep myself from highlighting practically every section.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I don't think that Lee Child has ever written a Jack Reacher book that I didn't enjoy cover to cover. \\"A Wanted Man\\" is no exception.
0399159029|4.0|One of biggest questions that came out of the Nuremburg trials (Crimes against humanity) was how so many seemingly average people were convinced that what was being done to the Jews, Poles, Gypsies (Romani) and Soviet citizens was necessary.  Almost every officer, whether SS, Gestapo or Wehrmacht who are in this book (and many who are named are the actual perpetrators) speaks about, \\"What was happening on the Russian front and in the 'freed' territories\\" as if they were just doing a tough job.  One character will say to another,'well he is sensitive or had a hard time doing his duty on the Russian front'.  But what they mean is that spending months on end, shooting innocent people can be difficult for some people and it shouldn't be held against them.<br /><br />(There is an apocryphal story about Himmler going into occupied Poland to check up on the work of the Sondercommandos who were carrying out his orders to exterminate the Jews and Poles. As he stood watching the people being led up to the prepared mass graves he decided to join in on the killings.  Not only wasn't he able to pull the trigger but spent the next few minutes vomiting up his lunch.  He agreed that it was a difficult job but had to be done.)<br /><br />Reinhard Heydrich was made the Reichprotector of Bohemia and Moravia after Hitler had dismantled Czechoslovakia.  He was also the head of the SD the intelligence arm of the SS and later combined the SD with the Gestapo to be in charge of all police activities in the Reich.  He was known to be the 'perfect' Aryan and was hated by both Himler and Goering (not to mention most of the German General Staff). (In an earlier book, Heydrich told Gunther should he be killed he should look to Himler as being behind the assassination.)  The police in Berlin (of which Gunther is a detective) come under Heydrich and he looks at Gunther as his personal 'hunting dog'.  When a murder is committed at Heydrich's hunting lodge in the Protectorate, he calls on Gunther to solve the murder.<br /><br />Kerr has created the quintessential 'locked room' murder.  The victim has been found dead in a room with locked windows (on the second floor) and a thick oak door bolted from the inside.  The victim had been sent back from the Russian front in disgrace because he had broken down from supervising the killing that was going on.  Because his family is from the same town as Heydrich, he is taken on as an aide-de-camp.  Unfortunately for Gunther, the lodge was full of high ranking Wehrmacht and SS over the weekend, and Gunther won't make any friends by interrogating these men.  Since Agatha Christie's novels are mentioned a few times it's easy for anyone who has read her to guess the murderer, but that doesn't make the book less interesting.  This is a very good addition to the Gunther series.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
B000JMKO3C|5.0|I saw what was coming before we got there, but I have to say the author does such a good job of developing each character.  I was swallowed up in the story and invested in it's outcome.  I think that is what every author strives for when writing a book.<br />I cannot recommend a book more, with one caveat, you may not want children or young teens to read this.  There is an explicit scene that makes it more for adults.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I had the pleasure of attending a lecture presented by Mitch Albom pertaining to his book, \\"Have a Little Faith.\\" I was very impressed with both him and the book which prompted me to read that story. When I learned of his recent book, \\"The Timekeeper\\", I knew I had to read it.  I was not disappointed.  Our society lives in a fast-paced world and I feel we are prisoners of \\"the clock\\". The Timekeeper gave me a new perspective of time, and the problems people face with it.  I highly recommend this book.  It is a \\"must read\\" in our modern society.

0307383415|5.0|This book is in very nice condition. It was shipped and received in a timely manor. The contents of the book are questionable and enlightening, it give a look into Obama and why he does what he does and thinks. Would not buy any more Obama books.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is really addictive to play. The new updates really made it tons of fun to play. Only thing it needs now is the ability to craft potions, armor, and breed animals. I would have rated 5 stars but now that you have to make food in order to regain health there just aren't enough animals to do this. You have to farm wheat to make bread and kill skeletons for bones to grow the wheat fast enough to keep food on hand especially if you have more than one person in your seed/world. So breeding would be my suggestion for a future update if possible.<br /><br />Other than that its great!  I love it. I'm planning on buying the computer edition now.
B000WCDBKM|4.0|I enjoy watching Johnny Depp act in roles that are different from the most popular or mainstream roles.  This movie offers a great example of a character that is on the darker side, unpredictable, and intelligent.  It is a dramatic film (not a lot of humor) with an interesting plot.  I am glad I bought it.
B0090EIILU|2.0|I enjoyed Sacha's previous films but this was boring and cliched. OK, so his previous films are cliche but they had that edge of your seat realism that is simply lost in the new scripted format.<br /><br />I cut my losses half way through because I knew where things were going plot-wise and enjoyment-wise.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I can't wait for the coins to regen, but would never get anything done if I didn't. I play it every time I pick up my Kindle.

B00913DPW2|4.0|this was extremely challenging. I barely got through the first five rooms before i had to use the walkthrough. the game does not explain why you want to find the puzzle pieces (must have all 99 to complete game). i don't remember if the &quot;how-to&quot; explained it, but the moths are hints: use them SPARINGLY. you can also collect gold coins, but the only use they are is to get ridiculous &quot;fortunes&quot; from an old fortune machine.<br /><br />my biggest complaint about the game are you have to have the sound on to complete certain puzzles (unless you use the walkthrough to get past those parts). I prefer a game I don't have to have sound for as I typically play when I can't sleep and I don't want to wake my husband with noise from my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that there is no guidance on what you're trying to accomplish in the game. it provides basic &quot;how to play&quot; directions, and you have a &quot;journal&quot; to read from the last occupant in the house, but none of that tells you what needs to be done other than you are there to banish some spirits.<br /><br />i would have given the game 5 stars if not for those two complaints. I certainly enjoyed the challenge, but found myself frustrated too often with the blind tapping.

1476712042|3.0|They call it \\"Fifty Shades for young adults\\".<br /><br />Walking One-Night Stand, Travis Maddox meets his match in Abby Abernathy. Travis is the one of the best underground fighters. Abby shows up in one of his fights dressed in a cardigan which he later sprays with blood. Travis is cousin to Shepley who is in a relationship with America, Abby's best friend. Abby and America are new to Eastern University, getting away from Abby's dark past.<br /><br />I admit that I enjoyed Fifty Shades for what it's worth. Reading it with a fanfiction mindset also helped. With that said, I did enjoy reading this book. I read it inside of 2-3 days and there were parts where I could not put it down. The writing is okay and easy to read. It was fast-paced and the... themes... are pretty interesting to young adults and adults alike. But there were bits in the book that, in the words of one of the characters, \\"has just become one convoluted cluster****\\". I think the author tried to fit so much about the characters that it became a bit confusing. Abby's backstory came out of nowhere but it was poorly handled that I didn't know what to make of it. I think it's supposed to be a driving force for the second part of the novel but it didn't have quite as much impact as what I think the author is going for that it almost became an afterthought.<br /><br />This book's strength is in its characters. Especially the supporting roles, America and Shepley. Abby and Travis were a little too ideal - straight A student bad boy and a \\"simple\\" girl who cleans up real nice? Yeah, of course. Travis came across as over-the-top scary many times. America acts like the voice of reason and at the same time, Abby's best protector. I love the way she goes all out in everything she does. I also love the Maddox family. What a rowdy group of men!<br /><br />What I did not like was the ending. It kind of turned me off from the whole thing. I felt that the ending was the biggest cliche of them all. It was very predictable. As soon as I realized what will happen, I went, \\"Please, no. Not that direction...\\" But oh well, got to have at least one painfully obvious cliche in every YA novel, right? And considering this ended up like it did, the story stretched on too long.<br /><br />I had a bit of trouble digesting that this is classified as a young adult novel. In the several bookstores that I visited, I've seen this shelved either under YA or contemporary adult fiction. It does have a YA feel but at the same time, it's a bit dark to be truly YA. Maybe for older young adults? If that makes sense. There are a few themes that I don't think will send the right message to the teen crowd. Also, I could totally see this as a TV show on the CW Network. This is definitely right up their alley.<br /><br />Rating: 3/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: If you liked Christian Grey and how he treats his woman then you might also like Travis Maddox. And this book.able. As soon as I realized what will happen, I went, \\"Please, no. Not that direction...\\" But oh well, got to have at least one painfully obvious cliche in every YA novel, right?

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this series.  But now that I'm done I can't find a good book to read. :(.  This story is sort of ripped off of the film Battle Royal.  Which is one of my favorite foreign films. So I was incited to check it out. Glad I did!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Have read all of the Lee Child (Jack Reacher) books and was looking forward to this new one with great anticipation. It was the least interesting book of the series. The car scene droned on too long. Ordered it as soon as it was announced and read it as soon as it appeared on my Kindle. Just did not have the action of the others until the very end--bordered on dull.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great drama series. It's about time we have something like this in America. Too bad it's not on our basic network so everyone can watch.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|If you don't get it, I won't convince you it's a great movie. Of my five kids at home, the 16 yr old hated it, the 14, 13 so-so, my wife won't decide, LOL, and 12 and 10 yr old loved it... I did too. My 22 yr old say it loved it, my 20 yr old did not see it... Seems a very personal like or dislike. If you can afford the gamble, get the blu-ray as its a big part of the experience - the eye capture...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game really makes you think out a strategy to play. I like the outside the box thinking because some of the levels are really hard and I am still stuck on one. All in all it is fun and my children like it too.

B0012QRPU4|4.0|Breaking Bad is one of the best written and acted series I've ever seen. The characters are sensational, yet flawed like all humans. Although larger than life, it is still believable and incredibly entertaining. The viewer is amazed show after show.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Sylvia Day has found a spot on my pre-order author list, which is very, very short. Although her books sometimes have plot and or character issues, her writing is compelling and her books are hard to put down. Not only does she nail descriptions and stir emotions, but she writes character chemistry and sexual tension very well.<br /><br />I would have given this book 5 stars, except that the characters -though flawed- were all perfectly-beautiful/handsome and nearly all wealthy. Eve was overly responsive to her beau at times she shouldn't have been, and Gideon was a too-good-to-be-true lover. (The average refractory period for an 18 yr old is 15 minutes--stretching to 20 hours for a man in his 70s, and the average time from penetration to orgasm [male] is 6 minutes.) Reflected In You is definitely fiction.<br /><br />That said, it was a real page-turner with intense scenes and a good plot. I was not disappointed. It's not exactly 50 Shades, but it has its similarities. It definitely has better writing. It also has frequent, graphic sex acts depicted. You are forewarned.<br /><br />I devoured book two of the Crossfire series and have pre-ordered book three.  4 1/2 stars.

B005XN31LY|5.0|Awesome, enjoyed the entire 1st series, and I loved the way they intermingled the fairy tale and modern day together.  The actors did an outstanding job and it was so well made.  Can't wait to see what happens in Season 2.
1423140605|5.0|I wasn't thrilled with the first Heroes of Olympus.  I liked the second.<br /><br />I LOVE the third!  There isn't a dull moment in this book.  Plus, we get to hear what Annabeth is thinking.  Lots of action, but a lot more character development than the previous 2 books.  Some romance, some love triangles.  Love it!<br /><br />But oh...the best part.  The ending.  I would buy the book again just for the ending.<br /><br />So yes, this was a fantastic book.  I can't believe I have to wait a whole year to find out what happens next.....
B00932A2MC|4.0|OK, I'll fess up, I'm a big fan of movies with stunning visual effects, almost to the point of forgiving a cruddy plot and low-budget acting. I thought Battleship might be one of those that needed a lot of forgiving. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The story line was engaging and the actors brought believability to a very fantastic premiss, particularly surprising given the thin acting credentials of some of the main characters. Over all, a great 2-hour escape with solid acting and superb production values. We streamed it first, and liked it so much that we bought it and watched it again two nights later.

B00338QENI|5.0|The amount of stalwart investigation the author invested in this book is awe-inspiring. Though the story of HeLa had been told before, no one took the time to dig deep into the background of the people, society and medical practices that people simple took for granted. The race disparity in medical science is worth learning alone from this amazing book. I think this will be a classic book that will stand the test of time.

I would recommend this book maybe college student. this book has rated r information but its not disgusting or anything of that sort. overall its an awesome book.

B00127RAJY|4.0|Having done Jillian's \\"No more trouble zones\\" dvd for the last few months, I was excited to try another of her dvd's -- especially because this was only a 20 minute work out (as opposed to \\"trouble zones\\" which was 40 minutes and made me want to die!). Level one was pretty easy, and I'm assuming those who are in shape wouldn't find it to be too much of a challenge. However, speaking from an intermediate worker-outer's point of view, level two is killer! I haven't gotten to level three yet - I'm almost afraid! After doing it for 3 weeks, I only have a few small complaints that I've been mulling over:<br /><br />#1 (which I have noticed from other reviewers) is that you have to watch her whole explanatory start-up talk at the beginning of the dvd EVERY time you start it; you can't skip past it. So that gets a bit annoying, especially for those who have very little patience, like me!<br /><br />#2 She sometimes says \\"a couple more\\" when you really have like 20 more reps to do, and she doesn't give much warning when she's about to switch to another move (sometimes the girls in the back even get confused and start late!) I know those things seem petty, but when I'm working out, I'm annoyed by little things. Aren't we all?<br /><br />#3 I feel like she really \\"phones it in\\" during the warm-up and cool-down on this dvd. I know she's trying to do things quickly since it's only a 20 minute workout, but I don't ever feel like I have properly warmed-up, nor do I feel like the stretches last for long enough at the end. I usually shut off the dvd during the cool down and do each of the stretches for longer. If I don't, my muscles feel tight and I get sore the next day. She's all about \\"no injuries,\\" so it surprises me that she would rush through the warm-up and cool-down.<br /><br />#4 My last complaint is that I don't feel like I get much of an ab workout (especially compared to \\"trouble zones\\") -- especially on level one. During the cardio and strength portions of each circuit, the workout is intense and you feel like you can't go on. But the ab portion lasts only for a minute and I am never, ever sore the next day - nor do I see a difference in my tummy area! I'm aware that it is more of a \\"recovery\\" time so that your heart rate can come down, but I still want more attention to be brought to my abs. That's where most of us reeeeeally want to be shredded, right?<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a pretty intense workout, and I suggest staying with a level until you are absolutely ready to move on. As she mentions, each level on its own is a great workout, so don't be discouraged if you're not to level two after the first 10 days. You just need a set of hand weights (she never mentions how heavy, but I use 3 lbs) and a mat, and you can always follow the girl who is doing the \\"easier\\" version of the moves. So there's no excuse not to give it a try!! :)
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This is the worst book I have ever read by Lee Child.  I will not even finish it.  I started loosing interest about 1/2 way through the book and continued it almost another 1/4 of the way.  I purchased this book prior to it being released because I have enjoyed most of his novels.  Next time I will wait until it comes out and check the reviews before I purchase it.  When it started explaining the description of the tunnels, I was done.
B007HU7NBK|3.0|John was on my bedroomwalls in the eighties. I always favoured him. Waiting for this book to come out it I read Andy's first (assuming it was going to be bad) and of course once I read Johns book there was going to be a comparison. Loved the story but once the story got to the important personal bits it felt as though there was emotion, detail and personality missing, like he did not want to write it. In Andy's book this was much more present. Do not get me wrong it is an entertaining read and when you read both books it gives you are more complete picture but you do finish the book  somewhat unfulfilled, needing more info and depth!
B007Z9QS5K|3.0|This movie did not really appeal to me. It was good but too many story lines. The acting was good and the actors did a good job with the script they were given.
B007TMON8M|4.0|The graphics are in keeping with the name of the game, but successfully playing the game is neither simple nor easy. It introduces you to the basic laws of physics and building, enabling you to understand through much trial and error why things are built the way they are.

B008QE9VJI|1.0|I was really disappointed in this film.  I have watched every movie and tv episode of the old series and was hoping this movie would bring that back.  The problem was that the old series was a drama, not a comedy. As much as I love Johnny Depp, this was a failure and a waste of money
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game.  Addictive!  Frustrating when you run out of coins.  Have to make myself put it down.  Simple and easy to play.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I read constantly, always looking for books that are not predictable----this is one that is so intriguing, that I would read thru dinner with my husband!  Fantastic read!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the better books I've read I wish there was a way to get the e-book signed by the author!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really love this app. I would give it 5 stars, but it has a glitch that sometimes forces the app to unexpectedly close. I am a Pinterest addict so I use the app a lot!!!
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Melody;<br /> Is incredible......<br />Fantastic and like most great artists has earned this distinction many times over<br />  You have to read her story of survival and why she is in my opinion the Best of the Best.......of Female Blues singers<br /><br />I feel she has Norah Jones beat hands down and I love Norah Jones next to her.<br /><br />  If Melody had the promoters that Norah did and has now the world would know about her just as they are aware of Norah.....<br /><br />Medody does have one distinction over Norah, She does not publish duplications of different cuts of her music on more than one CD,<br /><br /> Norah will getcha on that sometimes, It's still worth having Norah's work but why pay for it twice?<br /><br />I own all of Melody's CD's, and am on her Pre Order list, I have only had this CD maybe a month,<br /> Damn if this CD was made of vinal I would have worn it out already...lol.<br /><br />You qill never find a bad piece of Melody's self written primarily work...<br /><br />  She is nothing but low key, kick back and very mellow Blues........a dream come true.<br /> She is one of those artists that if you love the Blues you just have to have on your turn table and own all of her music......
B0091REZMW|1.0|If you are a fan of mystery games, such as Lost City, Mystery Manor, etc. avoid this one.  Strictly hidden objects, and with an annoying number of instructions, it's hard to get 'lost' in the game.  The number of pop-up instructions outweighs the amount of game time if that's any indication.
B00447L4JG|5.0|My number one favorite move when i was a kid and im 24 years old now and its still my number one favorite movie.... love all of Tim Burtons movies.... He makes Halloween scare into a treatful fun and makes Christmas that much joyful!!! He brings 2 absolutely amazing season and stories into one fun breath taking movie!!! I def. recommand this movie to everyone... my kids love it!!! we watch it every year on halloween night right after trick or treating perfect way to end the spookiest night of the year!!! =)
B0038QN2AS|5.0|An exciting hard to put down book that has all the right elements of an action thriller: scifi, IT, action, great storyline - bring it on.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Bones are forever is a great read from one of my must read authors. I always learn something from her books.I wasn't even aware that there were diamond mines in Canada,let alone all of the information about them that was worked into the story.I really admire Kathy Reichs and not just for her writing. What a talented person she is.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|OMG... Where to begin.  Do I really have to qualify my dislike of this album with my past reverence for her earlier work??? I guess so.  I've been a huge fan of Diana's for many, many years.  I've had mad respect for the way she's added to the American Songbook's color with her own hue when she'd cover the classics. Based on her previous albums, I PRE-ORDERED the album over a month before the release without listening to any clips (MISTAKE #1), thinking that it would be as awesome as the others I own.  My package came to my workplace yesterday, and I was joyously looking forward to that mellow feeling I normally get when listening to her singing paired with her smooth and eloquent playing of her piano.<br /><br />So what did I find when I put in the disc, you ask???  Well, from the opening notes, there came a dischordant \\"plunkity plunk\\", Thelonius Monk styled, bad ragtime pounding of the keys, and my irremovable first impression was that of when I bought my fourth Harry Connick Jr. cd, the one that he put out when he stopped covering good standards, and fooled me into buying his NaOlean's themed piano playing that sounded like a cat walking over a piano's keys.  Let's just say it was not a good first impression, and I prayed it would get better.<br /><br />Half way through the album, I opened the cover art to see artists and producers, fully expecting to find Elvis Costello's name on all of the songs somewhere, but didn't.  I understand an artist's need to try new things, but this was a real \\"shot in the foot\\" that I'm not sure she can recover from, I mean, only four of the songs (Glad Rag Doll, Prarie Lullaby, Here Lies Love, and All Over Now) even sounded remotely like a Diana Krall song we expect to hear her sing, and in most of the songs on the album her piano playing is either non-existant or just short vingettes stuck in between long guitar accompanyments... and what's with the horrendous duet and the last song with the wierd guy sounding like a carnival barker...UGH. Where her music normally leaves me feeling mellow and at ease, this one left me feeling depressed and \\"scowly\\". No bueno!!!<br /><br />Sorry Diana... This one was a stinker, a complete miss for those of us who really have come to appreciate what you've meant to american standards. Better luck next time, and I'll think of buying your next one, but not sight unseen or in this case, sound unheard.
0812984412|4.0|I guess the best measure of a writer's work is what you think of a book after you finish it and have had time to mull it over. Like some others, I was expecting a \\"big\\" ending that would tie all the stories together, but that big ending never came.  Instead, over the days after finishing the book, I found myself spending a great deal of time thinking about what the author was trying to say.  I can't say this was a great book (although I can say it was very well written), but I can say that it made me think -- and that alone makes the book worth reading.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Great read.  I have read 19 Lee Child novels and never been disappointed.  Reacher is the best.  Can't wait until the next novel, whether Reacher or something else.
0525953728|5.0|Mark's unit does indeed consist of the best guys this country has.  And they're not just the best fighters... they're also the guys with the biggest hearts, sharpest minds (who can perform when it counts, when the stakes are high), and imbued with a truly American version of the principle of heroic selflessness.  Thank you.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|SORRY DIANA BUT WE ALL KNOW YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT MUSICAL TALENT AND CAN DO ALL TYPES OF MUSIC-------BUT WHY ALL OF THIS?????<br /><br />IT DOES SHOW OFF YOUR WONDERFULL VOICE---BUT-----------<br /><br />AS A MUSICIAN---AN OLD ONE BUT STILL KICKIN'---LOVE WHAT YOU CAN DO BUT YOU MISSED THE MARK ON THIS ONE!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Although Lee Child's realistic prose and well-crafted plots always grab my attention from the start, the latest Reacher adventure lost me in the twisting nocturnal roads of the midwest.  Competing government agencies, inept bureaucrats and Reacher's resourcefulness keep the plot rolling along for about 3/4 of the journey.  But the twists and detours undermined the tightness of the atmosphere first established in the confines of the stolen car.<br />In a James Bond like climax, Reacher transforms himself into some version of a pumped up killing machine, destroying the terrorists protecting their gigantic bunker of nuclear waste in the depths of the heartland.<br />Child would serve her readership well to bring Reacher back to more human dimensions.  And on to Virginia.
0767812166|5.0|WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS FILM, I WAS COMPLETELY ENCHANTED.  THERE IS A SPECIAL GENTLENESS IN THE STARMAN CHARACTER.  JEFF BRIDGES DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB.  I BECAME A VERY HAPPY CAMPER WHEN THE STARMAN SERIES WAS MADE.  SO I'M HAPPY WITH BOTH OF MY PURCHASES.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I don't like Zombie shows!  People at work kept telling me to watch it, so I finally did, on netflix.  I loved it!  Bad part?  They only had season one.  I checked Amazon and bought the second season, now I'm waiting impatiently for season three.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good sequel to the first book if you know what to expect. Quick read ,but a little predictable at times.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the fair growing up...only you're not using real quarters....prizes could fall a little better, though, as too many are lost over the sides due to poor drops.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|As a fan of Star Trek the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine I felt I should give the originals a try. I am very happy I did. They are incredible I love the three main characters Kirk, Spock and Bones; their relationship realy makes the show. Highly recomended!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found this book on a recommendations from a friend.  It was very interesting to get an inside account of what occurred.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|After reading this, I can't wait for the 3rd instalment! This book was even better than the first, with great behind-the-war-scenes from all sides. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B006O5YI7G|2.0|thought this would be better with sam shepard,very slow,just leaves you hanging in the end.not even worth a second view
0525953728|5.0|I am not much of a book reader but this book has kept me turning the pages to see what is going on next.  I would reccommend this book!
0800141660|5.0|This movie brings Janes' book to life on the screen. Each actor was chosen perfectly, and they are all well known, and extremely talented. I can't imagine a better adaptation, and treasure this as one of my five favorite movies of all time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it.., it is a good game to play make sure that you buy more coins to play or you will lose
B00005MP58|5.0|As books read and reread become like familar friends, so this movie is one I go back to, over and over again. I must admit that it is my favorite of all movies I have ever experienced.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Too much fun. I can be found up late in my bedroom in the dark &quot;Pinteresting&quot;. Kindle edition does have some bugs and can be a bit frustrating but not enough to pass up.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|beautiful game in both graphics and mind puzzle solving.  excellent exercise for the mind while at the same time relaxing.
B008V0OLOW|4.0|I found this CD to be a very pleasurable listening experience.  I suspect that many of the negative reviewers might have missed the point.  The sounds and mood are intentional and tie in nicely with the themes of the music.  Highly recommend.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Typical jack reacher which means I enjoyed the read! Several twists and turns through out with fast pace makes it a cant put down read!
0316228532|3.0|J.K. Rowling's latest novel is a compelling story of the downfalls of class distinction, small-town pettiness, troubled marriages, angry and immoral teens, and the effects of abuse and poverty.  It is raw and painful; an insight into the struggles of people with no meaning in their lives beyond what is here and now.  J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, but I was so disappointed that her first 'adult' novel was so full of gratuitous smut.  Harry Potter went through life at Hogwarts never once having to relieve himself or take a bath, but in this novel we get descriptions of every sort of nastiness out there.  The main characters were supposed to be the adults, but Rowling's teens are the driving force in this novel, as well as the source of most of the vulgarity and disgusting behavior.  Why is it that today's authors seem to feel the need to add vulgarity and smut to their work in order to be read?  The Casual Vacancy covers nearly all of humanity's ills in lurid detail.  I can fully understand drug abuse, pornography, teen sexuality, child abuse, infidelity, and pedophilia without being dragged into the back bedroom to witness it. The last third of the book told the same story without all of the x-rated descriptions that were shockingly present in the early pages.  Though I appreciate the message and the reality of those who would overlook a small boy left alone, I won't allow my girls to read it, and my brand-new hardcover is going up for sale.  I am so disappointed.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I enjoyed this book but I can see why many could not get into it or did not like it at all. It was basically five interconnected stories running through different time periods, each with a cliff hanger ending half way through the novel and being resolved after the one story central tale. The format is odd, well written and compelling and could be confusing for many readers. It was imaginative but somewhat derivitive in small ways. I found it enjoyable and thought provoking but it did not stay with me after I had read it for long. I someday might read it again to try to find the small things I had missed, but I doubt the are few clues I overlooked.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I watched this movie and then I had to buy it! It is so funny! A great comedy! It is one of those movies that you can see over and over again and still find all the jokes funny! Worth the money!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From this first page this book caught me entirely off gaurd. My children had described the general plot to me and I actually picked it up with trepidation. It was fantastic and I could not put it down.
0439023521|5.0|I didn't know what everyone was talking about when they were saying this book was so good until I bought it! I literally couldn't put it down! I started reading it on Sunday and finished it on Sunday and was mad at myself for not having the second book to read next!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Following on from the previous book, this was again a gripping read, albeit that the momentum created by the previous two books flagged ever so slightly towards the end.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to come out and I was not disappointed. It was well worth the wait and now I can't wait for part two to come out! The Twilight Saga did not disappoint.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Having read The Hunger Games, I was not sure what the second book could offer. However the author managed to continue the excitement all the way through.
B009329Y30|5.0|I loved this movie! Nicholas Sparks is a phenomenal writer and this movie is phenomenal also! I read the book and watched the movie and they both did not disappoint! Great romantic movie! I would watch it again!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Excellent read! I am a voracious reader and love a great mystery/thriller. This book was a page-turner from the very beginning. Characters as well rounded and realistic and the plot keeps you guessing. It is well-written and best of all, has a good ending. This is a new author and I look forward to her next book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can spend hours on Pinterest looking for ideas to make.  It's a great source for sharing and finding ideas on just about everything and most have instructions on how to do it yourself.  Great for the DIY'er.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Reacher novels have not been so good over the last maybe, three of them. This one is a long short story and Jack Reacher (actually Lee child) has lost his \\"it\\" factor.. Hope he gets it back!
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I really like the author Terry Goodking's style but Amazon should really be ashamed to sell a book with so many typos & editing mistakes. Somebody should get their shit togeather and hire a decent editor and/or proofreader.  Any review that gives this mess five stars has to be a paid review.
B00846REIS|5.0|This one of those books that every kid should have to read so they will know what true abuse and neglect is.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is so much fun!! when you start playing it you get addicted to it!  best game I have played in a long time!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was one of the best books i've read in a long time. Verytouching in some spots and funny in others... Highly reccomend it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show is awesome i have every season and cant wait for the next season to come out on dvd i hope this show lasys as long as mash did
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found it to be a good combination of suspenseful and entertaining.  There were a few cliches that could have been avoided... like having Stuart be a psychologist... that's a little TOO convenient for me.  He also should have had more doubt placed on him, so you're wondering if he is a good guy after all.  Mostly this was a great read and I found myself looking forward to my quiet reading times with this one.  Kept me interested for sure!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed all 3 books of the Hunger Games. My Grandson thought it would be to gory for Grandma. I would like to see the movies of all 3.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|one of the best books I have ever read.  I learnt so much about the history of the Germans in the Channel Islands. Cleverly written as a series of letters.  A lovely romance and study of human nature.
B009K0P1VE|5.0|I loved the first Season and dying to see the second season.  This is a very refreshing and well written tv series. I recommend this to everyone.  Very good acting and it flows well.  I have many favorite characters.  I feel Mr. Gold was very convincing and fabulous.  The whole series is captivating and entertaining.  Nothing has been this great out there for a long time.  It's nice to see shows this great of magnitude out there.  Very imaginative!! Well Done.
B0015KGWZG|5.0|This is self help at it's simplest.  Dr. Dyer pulls no punches.  I find myself repeating his words like a mantra to save me from myself.
B007TML4EI|5.0|The only bad thing about this game is its over too soon! Well that and you can't view the leader board. DEV: MAKE MORE LEVELS!!!!
B001IXSU8M|5.0|I must say that I do love this CD - all of her albums are great, and look forward to others!
0307277453|5.0|The most straight forward, no nonsense, explanation of evolution I've read and I'm a believer.  May not convince a creationist, but if you could get him or her to read it, it might make them think.  This is written by an academic, but easily accessible to lay people.  Science writing at it's best.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melody Gardot never disappoints with her beautiful music. It has become a voice I can't live without. It's touching, fun, heart warming. She could sing a tool guide and make it beautiful.
145210655X|5.0|Wonderful little book to add to a Star Wars collection, and pretty neat for parents who love Star Wars and have young kids.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read and enjoyed most of Lee Child's books. However, A Wanted Man, was disappointing - too many overly long conversations and descriptions.
B00006AW2J|4.0|\\"Street fightin man\\" makes it all worth while IMHO....such a great tune<br />But the rest is good if not great at times....they dont make it like this anymore
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Good read, Grabbed my attention from the start.  Unput-down-able - two different nights I read till 3 am.  As ever Follett's research is top class and he paints a wonderful picture of the era and countries that it's set in.
0525953728|5.0|Easy and exiting read. Honest reflection of events. All the hype about secrets being revealed was non sense. Overall a great account of events pre and post raid.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|all you do is press a button like 50 times, then, watch the coins fall. you can sell toys for more coins. but, the coins are useless too.
B000GT6L9Y|5.0|Great family movie!  The kids will love it.  It has a lot of action, space monsters and sibling rivalry to boot!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The good vs evil story is told again and again, and this is just more of the same. However, in a culture where evil is misrepresented all to often as merely an alternative this film is refreshing. Evil is completely and obviously evil. On the other hand good is depicted in terms of charity, tolerance and love. Yet, it is also strong and the film depicts the good heroin as a capable leader. Freedom, and expression are championed, while evil is controlling, subduing, and brutal.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for reading, research, and the live option with oir church is awesome! My wife and i also enjoy the Daily Devotionals!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Gripping story and a easy to read style but \\"Fall of Giants\\" a must read before reading this book. You need to read the first book to get to know the characters of \\"Winter of the World\\".
0385339100|5.0|very good book....just what you'd expect from Grisham!!! I didn't put the book down for two days!! I can't say \\"one of his best\\", every thing that he writes are \\"his best\\"!!
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Dialysis patient gets killed by SEALS. No pictures and his body is dumped in the ocean? Who believes this b.s.? And by the way, if the author in any way violated his secrecy agreement, he would be in Leavenworth so fast it would make your head spin. More phony b.s. to back up the governments b.s. story. George Orwell's 1984 is much closer to the truth. Another Emanuell Goldstein.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was fascinating and could not put it down.  However, the ending just seemed unsatisfying.  Still a fun read though.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Ordered this DVD- have other Celtic Women DVDs.  This is one with Chloe- (a younger version) and two others who are not currently with the Celtic Women.  Delightful voice ranges and the violinist is so impressive....dancing and playing..in heels no less!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Upon receiving this watch I knew it was Quality! I have worn this watch now for 2 weeks, put the watch thru the paces. This watch keeps time perfectly! Date works like a charm.... This watch is AWESOME.... You will not be let down...P.S. I have a lot of watches, and I choose to wear this one!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Pretty good time waster doesn't seem to hurt battery life be aware its one of those games that wants you to pay for more credit if you can't wait.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I had perfect on the first 150 levels, downloaded the update and now have none... stupid.  I don't think I will be redoing that.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This movie was ridiculous.  I can't even find the words to say how awful it was.  It's not awful only because it bears no resemblance to the original or 1991 series.  I could accept (on some small level) a reimagining a la Star Trek.  This is a total farce.  I can't believe I wasted time watching this mindless drivel.  It is by far the worst Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have ever produced.  I was not thrilled when I learned it was going to be a comedy but this movie bears little resemblance to a comedy.  It is so unfunny!  It can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or thriller and it turns out to be neither.  It is all over the place with an uncohesive story and poor acting.  Even Depp is weak with this material.  I hope all you people who read this review please understand that this movie bears no resemblence to what Dark Shadows really is!  Watch the original series (or my personal fave 1991 series on Hulu or YouTube) to get a glimpse of what Dark Shadows really is.  It's dark, it's atmospheric, moody, gothic, romantic, soapy. Twilight, True Blood, Vampire Diaries all owe a debt to Dark Shadows.  I hope one day someone will bring it back to the small screen as that's where it should be.  Maybe when the vampire craze in popular culture has run its course, Dark Shadows will finally be resurrected the way it was intended to be.  Dark Shadows creator, Dan Curtis, once said people have tried to copy Dark Shadows and fell flat on their face.  Sadly, he was right!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was provided an ARC copy of Slammed courtesy of Netgalley and Simon & Schuster, in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Slammed was great.. so..so..so heart wrenching! I literally went through two boxes of tissues while reading this. (The only other time I've cried this much and hard was while watching P.S. I Love You) Don't get me wrong, there are up moments and funny moments too! The romance was infuriating yet perfect, and very swoony. I think out of all the books I've read this year, this has to be the most realistic reads yet. I could easily relate with the characters and the situation. I had sooo many notes on my kindle for this book.<br /><br />People make spontaneous decisions based on their hearts all the time. There's so much more to relationships than just love.<br /><br />Love.. Slammed takes you through all extremes of the form love... hate and loss, but also joy and infatuation. I had to put the book down a few times, so my emotions could catch up with it all. I have to say, I judged this book by it's cover.. and was really sad that I didn't get to this book sooner. (don't get me wrong, it's fitting for the subject but if I could change anything about the book it would be the cover.) I loved all of the characters especially Layken's little brother Kel.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Layken and her family are moving to Michigan due to financial issues. Her father died and her mother couldn't afford to live in Texas anymore. The day they arrive, Layken meets Will and his little brother. Layken and Will quickly hit it off after going out on a date to a slam. But they realize all too quickly that they cannot be together. Layken's family is forced with yet another family tragedy. Will their bond be strong enough to pull their relationship back together?
1455508977|5.0|I cannot compare this book to any others that have been written by NIcholas Sparks. I did however enjoy the book. Alot of people say the ending was forced and went by too quickly. I would say other wise. I enjoyed the ending of the book and it's fast pace ending. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Next I'd like to read The Vow.<br />On a whole new note for anyone who enjoys dystopian books such as The Hunger Games or Harry Potter for that matter. Read Divergent by Veronica Roth! Ah, the book is awesome!<br />All in all I enjoyed reading The Lucky One!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed and recommend this movie. It made us laugh and a gave cause for a few tears but left us feeling good. Recommended as a good movie to watch.
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|downloaded it...played it...uninstalled it...twenty words... really...WHY? not a game I enjoyed. did not see the draw. review should not matter to those who get it. just not my thing.
B008I34YYY|1.0|Well,  I'm not sure who the audiance for this movie might be but it sure isn't older, conservative folks.  Highly cliched treatment of various characters and issues. I was expecting a bit more adventure and less silliness. Oh well, you win some and you lose some. I rate this as a big loss and waste of time.
B004UID2LC|2.0|So I've had this app for a while now but just recently its gives me errors for everything I want to get! It's getting on my nerves! People fix this! NOW!

B00933JL0A|3.0|Starts out interesting but found if got repetitive trying to finish off production \\"quests\\". Thought I was finally finished and a new one pops up. Finally quit playing.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Mr. Child please keep writing Reacher stories!  I read to my husband as our form of evening entertainment and we both eagerly await the next Reacher book.  We always pre-order, and the moment it hits my Kindle we stop whatever we were reading and we jump right into the newest Reacher adventure.  We love that he ages as the stories continue and draws on his experiences and military background to always emerge as the hero, even if one not recognized by the other characters.  Keep it up, please!
030758836X|1.0|This book started strong and I loved it.  A little over halfway through it turned awful.  I hated it!  The ending was terrible.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was a fabulous book! Don't hesitate to read it, even if you have not already read the first one, Fall of Giants. What an author!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Nice case but hard to get it to stand on side. The cut on case should be deeper to work better.
B0097S0TM0|2.0|I think this is the weakest P!nk album in quite a long time, maybe even below Try This.  I've given the whole thing a few listens and there are a few mildly memorable tracks, but overall the content seems very weak.  Also, the other reviewers here are right complaining about the amount of profanity in this.  P!nk is no angel, and some profanity is to be expected, but it seems like the content on this one is much spicier than normal, and not in a good way.  My feeling is that it's a lack of expression on the part of the artist.  They can't say what they want to say elegantly, so they just throw in a swear. P!nk falls into that trap on this album FAR too much.  I'm embarrassed for her songwriting on this one.  Take a break, girl, and come back when your batteries are properly recharged.  We'll be here.  Just don't drop another dud on us like this.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great. Fun. Leaves you at the edge of your seat ..... Inlay whenever. I get a chance.  Passes time great.
B005LMEB8E|4.0|Demi has a good voice and clearly hired better writers and upped her game.  Good job and great pop music!
B0035OC830|4.0|Bill Bryson loves USA despite himself. Or does he pretend that he doesn't love USA (he lives in UK after all)? A seemingly dispassionate witness, he tells us, at the end, how much great and breathtaking his country is.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|i love this game. recommend this to everyone with little boys who enjoy running zombies over. watch out for the cars
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like it but the game gets  boring.  If u r bored its a good game to waste time . plus ever other time i play a game in the game it brings me to a add page ..
B002E66C6E|5.0|A great movie for anyone who enjoy action and on the edge of your seat suspense.  It's a timeless classic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! Kept me not wanting to put it down! Can't wait for the final book to come out. Great book to read after 50 shades
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|I dont know if its me or Jeffrey Archer is becoming repetitive and predictable. The twists in the tales which make him such a master storyteller is sadly missing in this particular book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have never taken the time to write a review before, however this book was that good that I want to make sure everyone knows it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and addictive.remove the adds and it would be better you should also be able to save progress after the update
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Addicting but not enough coins to use. Kind of hard.the rest of it is great I love getting the me prizes.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just a great book with a very nice story about the very nice period of a man's life.<br />It was also good for me as a foreign reader to get a picture of modern American culture.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was hard to put down.  In the beginning it seemed too obvious as to the reason for \\"Amazing Amy's\\" disappearance so I knew there would be twists, but the direction the book took was something I never expected.  I usually like happy endings but this book ended in such an unusual way, that I was OK with it not ending \\"happily\\".
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This is a superb second novel in the century series. The developement of the characters ensures you are involved in the story from the start. I can't wait for the next epic.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the AccuWeather app for my kindle fire. It is stored to my home page al the current weather with pop right up whenever I turn my kindle on. It is always accurate and very helpful. :)
B008XFB86Y|3.0|Very similar in plot to the new Judge Dredd, but it lacks nothing for action. Fast paced and gritty, should be a good watch if you like martial arts and bullets.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I've read all the Reacher books and consider myself to be a fan. Love this book as much as all the others, but I gave this book a 4 star because Reacher spends a lot of time in the car and detail is sometimes long and drawn out. There is not as much action as there usually is but still a good read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Has every...need a laugh, need a kid craft, need decorating ideas? This place has it! I am currently planning my wedding and am finding it as a great place to organize my ideas. I have even posted my own pics from other websites!
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say other than it's a stress reliever, an alternative to a sleeping pill and great brain excercise especially during chemo
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games, fun app, keep me from getting bored, cookies is my favorite game.one of the best free games I have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection was amazing!  I just happened across a reference to it on Goodreads. I can't believe I almost missed this unbelievably great series. Though it's technically science fiction it's really more of a \\"lifeboat\\" type of story that examines the psychology of survivors trapped together in a strictly regulated closed environment. One that has existed so long that none living understand why they live where they do or why they adhere to the rules and traditions of their society.<br /><br />The characters are extremely well thought-out and well rendered and their lives and their deaths touched me deeply.<br /><br />I give this series two thumbs-up. It can't be missed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|coin dozed is a fun free app.  It is mindless fun that you can visit a few times a day when you are looking to pass the time.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it several times since getting the disc. It is a true and accurate depiction of Suzanne Collins's well written book. The essence of each character was excellently captured by the actors and particularly loved how Peeta's role was acted. The movie portrayed the absolute dreadfulness and disbelief of children fighting each other for the whims of some and to the dismay of many. Music and sound was very appropriate and loved the music for the Tributes entrance in their chariots. Costumes, locations and Panem were fantastic.  While the detail of a book is difficult to reproduce, in the movie, there was an adequate balance of enough detail to stay to the writer's intent and keep the story moving along. For me, it was a joy to see such a vivid enactment of the book. All of the various parts worked brilliantly together for a truly enjoyable movie.<br /><br />On another note, Amazon's purchase process was easy as usual, and the product was delivered on schedule with no issues.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Watch out. Once you start you won't be able to put it down!!!! Plus my kids are entertained too! We like to pass it around &amp; share the fun!!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is a great way to get acquainted with the Mahjong tiles.  The tiles are crisp and very easy to read.  It works excellently on my Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this to those people who enjoy solitaire games.  It is a great way to exercise your mind.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so addictive and I even made my house, anyway it needs flint and stone in creative mode but other than that it is a gazillion start app. ( Wish the rating could go that high.)
B004YM6JLO|2.0|I've been a fan of the Vampire Diaries since season 1 first aired, however, this season was just awful and sorely lacking. Storylines were picked up and dropped all too quickly without properly being explored all season. Moreover, it was was the same stuff, just another season. It was always another party, Elena still not being able to chose which brother she wants, Caroline in yet another love triangle, Tyler leaving town again, Damon throwing yet another temper tantrum because he doesn't get his way, Bonnie constantly getting screwed over even though she's the only character that ever does the right thing, etc.<br /><br />And, even after having three whole seasons, there are still quite a few characters that remain underdeveloped (Tyler, Matt, Jeremy, and Bonnie). The worst lack of character development lies with Bonnie's character. Being a witch, she's very important to the plot, yet the writers manage to put her and her development on the back burner every single time! It's quite baffling.<br /><br />The character of Klaus was originally introduced to be the most ruthless, inhumane vampire ever, yet this season we saw him drawing ponies and crying about how his family doesn't love him.<br /><br />Overall, while this season had quite a bit of potential at its start, it was just lacking too much. Maybe season 4 will be better, but I think season 3 had pretty much closed this show for me.
B0091REZMW|4.0|After downloading this app I quickly became addicted.  It can be somewhat repetitive but is still entertaining.  I think you will enjoy it.
0525953728|5.0|Well written, gives you an idea of adverse circustances under which these professionals have to function.  Also gives an idea of technical prowess of US ARMED FORCES. Thanks for your sacrifices.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great App for the greatest book in the world. This app is a fantastic tool in conjunction with the word of God to help guide and shape your life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really like this book and it was all that I expected it to be.  The book is well written and I look forward to reading another book by this Author.  Please keep up the good work
B008VVT51U|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in years. Makes me want to retire to India with a group of English people.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really like this book and it was all that I expected it to be.  The book is well written and I look forward to reading another book by this Author.  Please keep up the good work
0345803485|5.0|I don't understand why some seem to dislike the book. Yeah, it's not perfect, but what is? Based on what I've heard, one either loves or or hates it. I can say with certainty that I loved it. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and definitely plan on reading the other two books. Maybe some are over thinking things? The point of fiction is just that...to forget reality for a little while. However, I understand that everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br /><br />Kudos to Mrs EL James and I hope to see more from her.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really like this book and it was all that I expected it to be.  The book is well written and I look forward to reading another book by this Author.  Please keep up the good work
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I have been a fan of Rayman from the 1990's when the original Rayman, with his detached limbs, shot down slopes, thru fields and forrests and hung from vines.  Rayman is a video game that trascends age, fun for 8 to 80 years olds....REALLY.  Although Ubisoft has not reissued the original games (Rayman, II, Gold, Arena, etc.) for current gaiming platforms, they did a great job with Jungle Run.  It's an engaging game, challenging but not so difficult that it gets frustrating moving from level to level.  As with all Ubisoft games, the graphics, vivid colors, easy controller actions and story-line make it hard for you to lose interest in the game.  Now if we can only get them to reissue those alder Rayman titles to work on Androids or PCs, all would be good with the world.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have loved this book since I was a little girl. My favorite character will always be Jo March. As you read you can just visualize her strong will. I cried when she didn't marry Larie, but she truly loved the professor. The book reminds me of growing up and the relationship with my sisters. A must read!
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|First off, I would assume this would be a pretty good game for an older child, but I can't see that the child would really care about it all that much. It is entertaining and a good concept with the Tetris feel, but it is basically the same thing over and over. A nice game overall, however.
0385344333|4.0|One of Lee Child's best novels to keep you guessing and in suspense. I especially liked the use of other than normal credit for support of terriorists organizations.
B007P7UF06|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT STORY WITH EVEN GREATER ACTORS BUT WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MUSIC.  I JUST LOVE CAMELOT AND AM SO VERY HAPPY THAT I NOW HAVE IT ON BLU-RAY, TOO.  THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES MUSICALS.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Cant wait for part II. Enjoyed this game. It is one of the better ones Ive played. I will buy the second one when it comes out.
B008XG1X18|4.0|sometimes wont open but otherwise great. just gotta quit and open it again and then everything is great and wonderful !!!!!!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Had enjoyed the TV series, then my daughter said there were books. I have enjoyed the books they are well written and easy to read. I have bought another ready to read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i guess its fun i dont get the point but its something to do when im borded it males me feel rich so yeah i like it!!:)
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I liked it.  The concept was good, though a little far fetched.  The tongue in cheek humor reminded me of the Dresden files.  And, living in the Phoenix area it was kind of cool knowing the locations the author was referring to.  A little linear and predictable, but fun over all.  And yes, Rula Bula has AWESOME fish and chips...
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|It's fun playing it for the first time but it loses interest fast. As a HUGE fan of those kind of arcade games... this app is boring. Lets just face it... arcades can't top apps.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really like this game a lot. It can be a little testy sometimes get hung up and just reboot my phone. Regardless it was hours of challenging fun.
B007SGM084|5.0|The first book is rather detailed and abusive.  However I just couldn't put it down.  I enjoyed the 2nd and the third book thoroughly.  What a great writer
0316228532|1.0|This book was very disappointing.  I loved the Harry Potter Series, the humor was wonderful in that story.<br />The Casual Vacancy is a big downer.  It is a sad tale about a sad village with people who are at odds with<br />themself and life.  It is very unpleasant to read.  I can't imagine why she would write such a book I had<br />to force myself to read the first 200 pages, then flipped through the rest. UGH!
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it so much I couldn't stop reading. I read the trilogy in 3 days. Exciting, heart stopping, AMAZING. Enjoy!
B007SGM084|3.0|Perhaps if the media had never given the Fifty Shades Trilogy so much hype then I would have had a lesser expectation of the content of the books. Then again, it depends on the 'taste' one has for particular literature, which would qualify these books as a good read.  The sex outweighed the drama.<br />Congrats Mrs. James for making a sexually explicit book readable without leaving me with disgust or guilt.
B0063IH60K|5.0|can play for hours, app works great no crashing.  I like how you can choose how hard you want it to be
B00943SQCI|4.0|i honitly think it was a great pg-13 movie and i would also sugest it for kids over 10<br /><br />it had some blood put for the famalies that dont mind it i think it would be great for one of thoes friday night movies
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Great product, shipped fast. Looks like it was brand new instead of being refurbished and the price I paid is unbeatable (124 USd vs 229 EUR I'd have paid in Europe).<br />The Forerunner 405CX has all the features I need to have from a reliable GPS enabled running gear.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was drawn in by this story right away. I'm a sucker for a good love story. I couldn't imagine a relationship with all that drama all the time. I was surprised by the way it all unfolded a couple different times. Good story, and I cant wait for the second one in April.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|The Grey is slightly entertaining mostly because the wolves are terrifying. The script is weak in enough to make one feel they are watching a first draft of a bad dream after eating some suspicious Korean food. One where the dogs eat you. The choices the characters have to live with due to the writers lack of thought make the film hard to swallow. Unless the intent was to say if you made enough bad decisions in your life to put you at the arctic circle, you probably will continue to make disastrous choices and you will end up as food for more organized, more strategic packs. Hey, maybe this is about the war between western civilization and \\"animal\\" jihadists of the middle east. It is all about oil. Now it makes sense.....
B005EM8O8O|4.0|I had never read any books by Robert Harris. The Fear Index was recommended by the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit. I almost didn't buy it after reading the reviews written by disappointed Robert Harris fans. But then I bought the book (Kindle edition) and really enjoyed it!!! I liked the way the hedge fund world was portrayed, the book, even though the plot is an exageration of what could really happen, makes you appreciate (and worry about) the craziness of our speculative financial system. Playing the financial system, buying and selling becomes an obsession, a game, like gambling, and the gamblers, the nerds, lose all notion that their games affect real people's lives. A real page turner, especially for people who are interested in exploring the absurdities of speculation-driven capitalism. If you don't find that subject interesting, then maybe the book is not for you.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I have followed this show ever since it has been on the air, can't wait to get season 5 as soon as it comes out .I have 1,2.3.and now 4 .thank you for having it at a reasonable price .
B009329ZF2|2.0|The movie it's ok but can't watched perfectly and couldn't heart it. I do not going to order another movie again.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|It was almost a good movie. Visually it looked great. Amazon did a great job with streaming it too! That was it. It was amazing that so many psychologically screwed up and incompatible people would be sent so far out into space. Hell, I wouldn't have known that the geologist was a geologist if he didn't actually state that he was one. Especially since he was doing space suit bong hits while exploring the ruins. And how the hell could they get lost on the way back to the ship. Oh yeah, he was high. go down the corridor and turn left and you should be at the lobby, if I'm not mistaken. Further more, you don't take your helmet off ever! It doesn't matter that there's oxygen there, you don't know if there is some sort of new micro organism that you can't detect. I've also never seen so many murder/suicide happy people before in my life. And the self-surgery/abortion scene, I don't think she would have been running around immediately after having an alien surgically removed from her, magic tech or not. Also, how the hell did the proto-face hugger grow so damn large without any sustenance. What, it consumes air and bandages? You can't just spontaneously create matter from nothing. Energy... sure. But I doubt it had a built in energy to matter converter. Oh, and let's not forget about the idea of the engineer being able to grant immortality. How the hell could any one assume that from scribbles on cave walls. Yeah, plot holes abound. I keep thinking that if they cut half the crap out they could have had an excellent film by just flushing out what remained. Oh, and before I forget, even if you haven't seen the film yet, if you've seen any of the trailers, you've already seen the ending. I'm so tired of crap like that. Stop showing the endings in movie trailers idiots!
B001AITGWE|5.0|This is a great classic!  The world might be a better place if we had more people like this....just sayin
B005OK722U|1.0|Hostel 3 had a good idea-have the club from the first few films bet on people's lives. It was only shown three times while the rest of movie just dragged on with boring characters who drank, gambled, & try to get laid. I wouldn't even recommend this film to fans of the first two movies or horror in general. This movie just sucks, plain and simple.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Gasland goes where many fear to tread and exposes potential dangers of hydro-fracking.  Much of the film is presented in the first-person and some of the video quality is shaky.  This was not a detraction for me.  It gave it a fresh shot of credibility and a personal perspective.<br /><br />Gasland addressed water quality issues that may result from fracking and showed potential effects on humans, livestock and the environment.<br /><br />It discussed how the gas and oil industry is exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Their practice of fracking to release gas and oil reserves from rock below the ground is not subjected to testing for effects upon drinking water.<br /><br />The film suggests the gas and oil industry is so powerful that they suppress academic findings showing dangers of this practice, and that they buy the silence of people on land contaminated by fracking and other industry practices.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that there will be a sequel and am looking forward to it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Finally a good freaking game for Android. Seriously, if you're sick of lame TCGs download Jetpack Joyride. It owns. Extra words.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  Best book yet.  I will definitely be waiting impatiently for the next book, and loved this one.  Best cliff hangerending ever!
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I have been playing Pigments about one week and truly enjoy the more advanced levels, especially color subtraction and color wheel shift. So far I have cleared the first three levels, have one puzzle left on the fourth level, and have started on the fifth level. I am curious what I will find on the sixth and final level. Bonus has three levels of Gridplay. I unlocked two out of three and like how these will provide additional puzzles after I clear all the levels.<br /><br />I did not find the lack of instructions a problem. Apparently my 11 year old granddaughter did not need instructions either as she cleared the first eight puzzles during a car ride that was less than 10 minutes long. Demo mode is nice for allowing another person to play the game from the beginning. It would be nice if Demo mode had an option to unlock levels or a way to save unlocked levels or if there were multiple profiles.<br /><br />I like how multiple puzzles are unlocked within a level at one time. This allows for working on additional puzzles when stuck on an earlier puzzle.<br /><br />The Empty Tile Undo option showed up on my Kindle Fire yesterday and I tried it out today. Thanks for the clever way to make undo easier to access on the Fire by selecting an empty tile and moving in the direction of an arrow when the option is selected on the Bonus screen.<br /><br />This is a fun and relaxing puzzle game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game, used to spend tons of money at arcades everytime I saw the game. Now I can play anytime I want. Wish the free coins would regenerate quicker, then I would play even more!
B000I186FW|5.0|this movie is amazing!! theres no other words for it. way better then i origionaly thought it was going to be. it has action, romance, humor witch was actually suprising. and just a great story line. this is a MUST see movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is well written and suspenseful.  I am smack dab in the middle of the book and I cannot wait to finish it!
B0091XRL86|5.0|We laughed all the way through the movie. We liked the parts of finding things that was invented way before this time. Kids loved it. I am a big fan of Wallace and Gromit a lot of good memories and a lot of laughs. I have to say a little long.
B008TMOIEK|2.0|The first few chapters were decent, but I was very quickly bored. Over and over I read about Christina being hot. The food obsession thing annoyed me too.  The book was so totally ridiculous.  I rarely do this, but I actually quit reading the book when I was about 3/4 of the way through it. I just couldn't waste any more of my time. I'm not really sure what all the hype was about.  I also think the whole \\"dom/sub\\" thing is bizarre and I really have no desire to know more about it.  Give me plain, old-fashioned romance with some normal steamy sex any day over this crap. Get the Clif Notes if you need to know what this series is all about.
B005HSL626|4.0|its a good game,  but it blacks out from time to time in the beginning or middle, but its weird because the game itself keeps going (if you have the sound on you can hear it) and you can keep slicing fruit even though you cant see them. like I said, weird.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Good to find something that exercises something more than your trigger finger!  Maybe a little simplistic but still fun to watch forces at work.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great read. It was a fast read, that I could not put down. I would recommed for an adult read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book has the usual Ken Follett touch with descriptions of characters and places so real that you live with them in the story. The times and causes leading up to WW1 were always vague to me, but I feel better educated from having read this depiction of the first third of the 20th century. Looking forward to the next third.
B002XHNMW6|4.0|This is a cleverly worded, interesting book. It is almost certain<br />to absorb readers!<br />The movie is fantstic also! And I'm sure you would like it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's just for a few minutes but they're fun. Gameplay is straightforward. There's no need to spend actual money for coins; they accumulate fairly quickly offline and the cap increases as you level up.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|\\"Nothing to Lose\\" was slow paced, perhaps due to the setting of the book, in the desert.  Certainly the feelings conjured up by the author about small town desert communities moves the imagination to be fearful of the inhabitants. Although I have immensely enjoyed the previous fifteen books I found \\"Nothing To Lose\\"  anti-climatic.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|Let me start by saying there has been some criticism regarding the quality of the bluray in terms of the picture quality.  I will definitely tell you that the picture is very good, it has sharp, clear vibrant colours.  The sound is very good as well. All in all, I'm rating it as follows:-<br /><br />Pic Quality 8/10....slight grain in certain places but not consistent!<br />Sound Quality 8/10......it isn't too overbearing, just perfect!<br /><br />I have the regular special edition dvd and the bluray, and I can honestly say the bluray is better! This is the way to watch it now as far as I'm concerned.  Both versions were played back on a Sharp 60\\" Aquos LCD, connected to a Sony Home Theatre System BDV-E500W.  The price of the bluray is currently 7.99, you simply cannot go wrong! A cool movie, and a good bluray at an excellent price, need I say more!?
B001NLL8LA|5.0|For me it was my fifteenth Jack None Reacher story.  From the very beginning you are absorbed by the character.  He is everything you expect him to be.  After reading \\"Worth Dying For,\\" my question is... \\"WOW\\" what's next?
B0074Q41LW|5.0|While \\"The Royal Road\\" may be neither royal nor a road, it is an excellent book for beginning and intermediate magicians. It covers a wide variety of both techniques and tricks, and is highly recommended for every magician's library.  As much as I enjoy my Kindle, this is one book I wish I'd purchased in \\"hard copy\\", to be able to pass on to my granddaughter.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is such a great game......way better than all the rest I get stuck and it has hints to help which is great.,
0345803507|1.0|In this final installment E.L. James manages to make Christian even more unlikable and Ana seem more stupid than ever before.<br /><br />Like the other two books, most of this one is filled with scenes of Ana doing something careless but totally forgivable, Christian flying into a rage, Ana being afraid of him but also upset at his over reaction, then after thinking about it she blames herself for the situation (because of course it's her fault Christian is totally unstable), she and Christian have a half-assed discussion of the situation before Christian initiates sex so he can avoid the real issues and absolutely nothing is resolved but somehow everyone is happy.<br /><br />Just some random things that don't make sense in this book:<br /><br />1. Ana's inner goddess has some very specific reading material.  That's right, E.L. James couldn't take the time to self edit or develop any type of engaging plot for the book but she did take the time to inform us that Ana's inner goddess enjoys reading Charles Dickens Complete Works Volume One and Two.<br /><br />2. Ana is a 22 year old, college graduate yet she isn't sure whether she is allowed to drink alcohol while pregnant. God help this child.<br /><br />3. As other reviews have talked about; joking that your unborn baby likes sex is disgusting and disturbing.<br /><br />4. When Ana regains consciousness in the hospital, Christian thinks it's perfectly okay to ignore everything the nurse tells him. Of course she's only a trained medical professional, what would she know about you beloved wife's health and safety?<br /><br />I could go on but I think you've got the point.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it..... Having so much fun sitting here wasting time and playing this game with my kid.  I wish the coins came faster!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|These books have been very interesting thus far, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next one. Very hot and romantic at the same time.
0307891372|5.0|I recomend this guide because it has many aspects of the game shown. Some minor spoilers but they warn you about it. It lists all quests in the game which is great because I would never find them all. The quests section is divided in miscellaneous, daedric, main quest, etc... Some quests are really hard to spot such as the one that increases your archery skill in about six points.<br /><br />The guide also advices a few character templates complete with which skill trees to choose and wich perks are better combined. There is also a map with every location in Skyrim and the book mentions the locations so you use them both together. There are maps of every dungeon and info on every loot inside them. There is also a small guide to every mine in the game and which ore is inside. And also the location of every marriadble NPC and every follower.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|This movie was so-so, mildly entertaining, not going to purchase this movie, or see it again. The acting was better than the story. so I did not hate it but surely won't see it again...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|started,reading this,series after I finished the fifty shades books the books were recommended by my sister thank you cause i think i like these books better cant wait for the next one already have it preordered!!!!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Despite being a veteran, I had no idea of the dedication and level of training and support for our Navy Seals.  Few Americans have any conception of just how exceptional these men are and how challenging their missions.  After all the negative news of late it is really inspiring to learn what goes on just out of sight.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This work is so terrific I feel presumptuous in reviewing it. It's a masterful Scorsese documentary on an iconic subject. Aside from loving the doc in itself I found myself comparing where I was when all this was happening. When Dylan was becoming known in Greenwich Village I was seventy miles away at Ft. Dix, training basics. I used to go into the Village, but I wasn't aware of him then. But I bought Freewheelin' in the PX on Okinawa in 1963, and took that and the first three Joan Baez albums to Vietnam with me at the end of '63. That was in the days when Special Forces thought of itself as a kind of armed Peace Corps. I was turned on to Baez and Dylan by young Green Berets who identified with their music totally. Nobody knows that anymore. What they know is a media image that does not even remotely match the reality of what we did. We loved the people we fought with. The clever little buggers wouldn't die for you if you didn't. That's the sum of my experience of the '60s, that I fought with people who died for freedom and didn't get it because we left them. And that's what washes over me when I hear Masters of War.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very confusing, I'm 1/5 of the way through and want my money back. With her talent in other areas of writing Rowling should stick to children's books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This latest book by Mr. Childs does not disappoint,the way he lays the plot out with little tells hidden in descriptions and storyline warrants reading twice so you can say oh right there it is the whole time.My first book was his 3rd reacher novel after that I was hooked and read all of his books in order.Though they're stand alone novels there are vague references to previous experiences you can give a knowing nod to as reading.Reacher is by far mt favorite bad ass hero,his moral compass for right or wrong is engrained in his character or fair and just not wether its legal or not.I've read the blog about a movie coming out but TOM CRUISE as Reacher get real,his 5ft tall.I,d like to give some Reacher justice to that casting director.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Simply said, check out the 5 star ratings everyone is giving this book, download it, buy it, whatever and read it.  It will expand your heart and your mind.  It will help you be a better person and be a better parent.  Just read it, you will be glad that you did.
B002E8B212|4.0|Albert and Stevie are naturals playing together. Every song on this album is good. Albert talks about a recording with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. Iwish they had that recording available.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|If you are a fan of lee Child dont buy or attempt to read this. On several occasions I could not continue. It is full of padding. The plot is implausible and Reacher is elevated to superhero.He has \\" reached \\" past his use by date.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was great to purchase via Kindle the book , but I wasn't very happy with the subject of the book , that I found it cheese !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app a lot.  It was nice to be able to download different versions.  I like everything about it.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|This is the first novel for S J Watson I have read & found it to be a stimulating read. It was thought provoking & enjoyable to the end.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I first discovered Mumford & Sons when I saw their performance on the Grammys.  After finding out who they were and getting their first cd, I fell in love with them.  As much as I loved their first album, I think I love this one even more.  I just can't stop listening to it.  This is definitely one of those rare occasions when an entire album is great.  I love the more popular titles I Will Wait and Babel but my favorite tracks are definitely Below My Feet and Ghosts That We Knew.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the book it was confusing at times and didn't seem to get to the point but very hot and   steamy scenes
B003F3FJQO|3.0|The Scorch Trials was a good book, but a bit boring at most parts. There wasnt very much action until the end, and it was sometimes a struggle to get through the middle of the book.
B007SGM084|3.0|I brought the books because of the hype from television and co-workers.  I had my local library put me on a waiting list because the books were so popular.  So since I couldn't wait any longer, I ordered the bundle for my Kindle.  Needless to say, the books were over rated and the first book was written so you had to buy the second book the way the first book ended.  Some of the story lines were so repetitive, and I felt that if there wasn't so much repetitiveness, the books could have been narrowed down to maybe two books.  It was hard getting into the first book and I kept skipping pages to get to some exciting parts that were few and far between or even putting it down for a few days and then going back to it.<br /><br />I finally finished all three books and would not recommend them at all.  I read much better written adult books on my Kindle. Sorry.
1451662432|1.0|The book sucks.<br />My story does not.<br />Years ago, I interviewd Arnold at the G+W Building in Madhattan.<br />I was wearing Willi Wear ribbed corduroy slacks.<br />Arnold squeezed a piece of the fabric between his fingers and asked me what it was called.<br />He had no idea. Then.<br />Or now.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this and the previous fifty shades books so much. Read all three within a weekend. So glad I bought it!
0321344758|5.0|I am in the beginning of my web design and development journey, so i think this was perfect reading for my starting point. It was easy to read. The author's points and examples brought everything together for a good understanding of the concepts related to usability. Keeping things simple, uniform, and friendly are the overall message. Testing is briefly touched on, but it is not the focus of this book as he states. This information is a must-read for anyone in web design and development.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|10/10 Just the right amount of violence and comedy that keeps making me rewatch and add to the list of my favorite movies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love it!! My sister and I play for hours.  Some games are easy and some really challenge you. Its free so the price is perfect!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A beautifully written continuation of the peoples lives we were introduced to in the first novel, Mr Follett brings alive the past with extraordinary detail. Once you start reading its hard to put it down. Well done as usual.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Historical novels are great when they interject personal/cultural details that make the stories interesting. Follett has done this by focusing on the personalities of the classes of people in countries participating in the war. It is amazing how the egos of leaders can cause personal/cultural/international crisis that affect millions. The working class does what it has to do to survive. Follett did a good job of intertwining these dimensions.
B00280LYHS|5.0|CAN NOT PUT IT DOWN! THE BOOK TAKES YOU IN, LIKE YOU ARE THERE AND YOU BECOME A PERSON IN IT. A PERSON ALMOST THINKS IT IS REAL.<br /><br />MIKE
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|okay so all these people that say it freezes ur kindle or u need wifi to play heres the truth one ur kindle might be over heating a bit and two u don't need wifi to play that is for an update of angry birds other than that this game is amazing and there is really no way that u can prove me wrong
B0094ZJK4O|5.0|Third time is just another charm for Richie Sambora. A huge fan of 'Stranger in this Town', the first solo album from Sambora..a blues driven rock album and of 'Undiscovered Soul', his sophomore second album that was more AOR inspired...I find that 'Aftermath of the Lowdown' has its own unique flavor just as the previous two.  It has a touch of blues, of Hendrix..there is a modern, new era feel to some of the guitar licks and rifts..they lyrics are as poetic and earnest as anything he has written solo or with Bon Jovi.  Mr. Sambora, in my opinion, should never take 14 years between solo albums.  Each one is testament to his diversity, his talent and his vision.  Personally, I think this album will be an inspiration to anyone who listens.  Cannot wait for what he has up next.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think that this app is a good one. You can have problems with it but it is way better then pintrest mobile. If you do get a pintrest app, get this app. I got all of them and this one was the best!
0316228532|5.0|I recently finished listening to Casual Vacancy.  I was sorry to see it end. I found the book realistic, dark in places, character driven - hard to put down and also fascinating. Yes this is an adult book - and JK Rowling explored some intense issues sometimes graphically - yet she also explored some dark places in the Harry Potter series (which I also have read). The main characters are fully developed and multi faceted. I was never bored. I recommend Casual Vacancy for someone who wants to immerse themselves in a story and is willing to read about realistic, human foibles. My only complaint was ( as someone here also mentioned) I wish it could have been longer. Write on JK Rowling - I'll keep reading and listening.
B008FOB124|5.0|Well worth the wait, and amazing as ever.  After so many years the energy and emotion of DCD remains so strong.  Highly recommended!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I debated about reading this book for months before finally giving in to curiousity. Reviews range from \\"great\\" to \\"horrible\\" and I figured it was time to decide for myself. Unfortunately, it was horrible and true to many other reviews, (and much to my admitted embarrassment) I couldn't stop once I started. It seems as though the author is writing from the perspective of a prude, ignorant housewife who finds some badly written smut on the internet and thinks, \\"I can do this, too.\\" Hence, we have this undeserved acclaim for a novel that's only marginally better than any one of the \\"fantasy\\" letters you can find in any seedy Forum magazine.<br /><br />Anyway, read at your own risk, although I do have one random favor to ask: How many times is the exclamation \\"Oh my\\" used throughout the book? Seriously, I should have counted as I was reading but now that I've finished the book, I don't have the slightest inclination to start at the beginning and get an accurate count. My guess is around 50. Prove me wrong, please.
B008220DGE|1.0|Zero stars. I felt compelled to write a review to save people from wasting their time and money on this garbage.  I had the misfortune of seeing this movie today with my husband and we both couldn't believe what a horribly written and misogynistic movie this was!  Literally people were walking out left and right.  The movie attempts to create an engaging storyline that leaves the viewer disgruntled and confused.  The ending was flat, like the storyline, and at the end of the movie my husband said, \\"Well, that was a waste of two hours,\\" and the couple behind us said, \\"We were just saying the same thing.\\"<br /><br />Save yourself the time, and frustration, and skip this one!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very entertaining read, with lots of turns and twists. Well written and it keeps your interest. The characters are fairly well fleshed out but the book has enough mystery that saying more would give away too much.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This will rank at the top of well written and entertaining novels.<br /><br />I am waiting with baited breath for book 3.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is cool and when you start to play it you get adictied to it I love it so much
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! My only complaint is that sometimes I have to close &amp; reopen to bring it up.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|it randomly goes slow motion to fast motion when u get past level 40 terrible when u get past level 40
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great. but it is addicting. don't like the side walls going down thou. kinds cheap looking but other than that it is great. has that Carney feel to it.

B0087HT36U|5.0|Love it, love it, love it. This is an excellent game that's addicting. Way better than angry birds. A must have!!.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Men will watch this movie for the pornography. Full flegged, no holds barred, pornograhy. Oh yea, historical pornography. With, I might add, children, and teens watching. How historical that is I really doubt such an republic, who had some sense, would act like cavemen. Or is this were our republic is heading? Whatever feels good do it whenever and wherever you want?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best ever!! I am reading it again! I was afraid to forget any details, that is why i decided do read again. And also, to be true, i was start to miss him!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I loved the second season of Spartacus. I found the film and story line, along with the plot to be explosive, great story, surprising ending that we the Best.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I knew this game couldn't be 50mb as listed.  I wish the actual game size was listed. it took a looooong time to download and I had freezing issues on my kindle fire but overall a good game. 2bucks for this type of game is reasonable. be prepared to backtrack a lot. sometimes the hint button didn't give a hint but acted like it did. the &quot;fun&quot; quotient in this game wasn't up to par.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|The idea of aliens comming to Earth was not uncommon in the movies. But as I kept my eyes glued to the movie it was high tech, great plot. It was rewaarding to see a great piece of SYFY. The battle was a total surprise and had me on the edge of what was to happen next. It is thriller, yet awesome battle, an adventure, with high balance of action. A must See!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is terrific it calms you down enough that you slip peacefully into a deeeeep sleep.can calm you down after an exciting day. my cup of tea is river cave all types of rain white noise flute piano. I promise you that this is an effective way of meditating and sleep. some of you complain of not being able to download it. this is not amazon's problem.this is the company that created this app's problem. please take my advice;studies have shown they this works. now sleep.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|A Matter Of Honor is another Jeffrey Archer tour de force. It is a typical Archer book in the manner that it weaves the story togeather through character development. The characters are all very interesting and it is quite a good tale that Archer tells. The best part for me is that the ending  was a little bit  different from what I was expecting.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy this game, and don't begrudge the devs trying to make a little money. I know I don't work for free either. Subtract 1 star because when exit the game my income hasn't been accumulating. Other than that no complaints.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you love pinterest this app is for you. A great fun app easy to use. A must try app.
B0081YBD8A|5.0|I loved it great series been compared to the l word but it's not true. This cast  and series stand apart . I hope series 3 is just as incredible hope to see more of Ds murry ;Lexy; and the rest gang
B00370J7E0|5.0|I have always wanted this album for myself. Now I have it thanks to Amazon's Cloud ...I too am in the clouds when I listen to Stevie and Christie rock on.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|Loved this movie. It was very clean and fresh. I enjoyed it more than most movies this year. What if?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I think all Americans were excited about the killing of OBL for his evil and violent acts on innocent people.  However, nothing can be compared to the sacrifices of our American soldier. After reading this book I want to hug every man and woman that serves this great country and protects our freedom. I am so thankful for the Seals and other Special Ops that go deeper into harms way to protect their brothers.  Each family that stands behind their spouse, father, son, and grandson, deserves our support for the sacrifices they make so that their loved one can stay focused on their mission. May God bless all of our men and women serving our country, and a special blessing to their families.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is one of the most fantastic books that I have ever read. The story plot is never boring and all the characters are so unique. The 2 main character Diana and Matthew are just wonderful. This story is so different from any ordinary witch book and it will surpris you. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Beating the odds of drug addiction and becoming a legend and ultimate example as to what it means to be a Warrior, Leader, Loving Father, Husband, and Spiritual Leader. Adam Brown has set the bar for all of us to shoot for. If we can can accomplish half, we will pillars in our communities. God bless his family for their loss, his Seal brothers, and for all of our military.  Tears were flowing down my face as I read the testimony of Adam Brown and his example of what America truly stands for. He made the ultimate sacrifice for our  freedom.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I looked forward to this second in a Trilogy, and was not disappointed. As far as I know from my knowledge of history, Follett was accurate, so as one reads the tragedy of war as well as the happier moments the pages turn rapidly without stumbling blocks. Ken Follett is well on his way to becoming my favorite author.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|While we sleep comfortably knowing that our Country is safe. Our Special Forces are Warriors at night protecting our freedom, protecting the brotherhood, and protecting the other Armed Forces of the Military.  Chris Kyle's book is an example of extraordinary courage and commitment to keep his Brothers protected under his watchful eye as a Sniper. Killing the worst people this world has to offer. Savages that use women and children as shields to advance their evil religion and kill Americans.  I have the upmost respect for the men and women who serve our Country, and for those who pay the ultimate price for our freedom..  Chris does an excellent job of giving an insight with out putting others in danger on the life of a Seal.  A must read.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|I'm biased- I grew up playing in brass bands. The mix of brass and percussion works beautifully. Another delightful album from David Byrne, something that freshens the neurons!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Mr. Follett  is true to form in this latest gem.  Once again he produces an eye into an important period of world history with the fictional embellishments that only he can dream up.  My only problem was the rapid rate of reading one cannot help but be victimized by. Cannot wait for volume three to appear.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is fun and creative. Connecting with grandkids imagination and artistic skills is exciting.  Also being challenged by my artist daughter makes me work on my skills.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|WOW !!! When is the 2nd book coming out? stayed up all night to finish. Reminds me of David Gemmell work.

B009CPJHY4|4.0|more scenery would make it better.<br /><br />For two older adults, the quiet, gentle and fun treatment of several problems of both the older characters and the very young characters was just right for an evening at home.  Maggie Smith and Judi Dench did not disappoint. The stars we were surprised to enjoy were previously unknown to us, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup.  GREAT portrayals and fun even in the scary or sad parts.<br /><br />We enjoyed it and would like to see more of the same actors and/or characters.
B0027MJU00|5.0|The second novel I have read by Gillian Flynn.  She is a master at twisting the plots of her stories in a way that keeps you guessing until the reveal!! Must read.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|The movie was good...the quality of the streaming was horrible...so buy dont stream...I thought it would be more of a comedy, yes it had funny parts but all in all it was serious...I liked it

B00499K9E0|5.0|There have been a few Sherlocks I've enjoyed over the years. Recently I've been quite fond of Robert Downey Jr as the hyper-observant sleuth. Frank Langella played a very convincing Holmes on stage some years back. And who can match Basil Rathbone, who is to Holmes what Sean Connery is to James Bond. Could there be a more quintessential English surname to play the part?<br /><br />What's this? A version of my favorite detective in a contemporary setting? I shuddered. This has to be terrible, right? There are some things that are sacred... Like Holmes and Watson traipsing around Victorian London, hailing horse drawn carriages and spreading BOLOs via the street urchin network. This isn't just potentially terrible... It's blasphemy!<br /><br />But this guy is named Cumberbatch... That sounds &uuml;ber-English. So I had to try.<br /><br />In the first scene we have a press conference of all things and every time the police spokesman makes a statement, everyone in the room gets a text message that says, \\"Wrong!\\" OK, I was entertained... By the end of the first installment I was hooked. It really is possible to do credit to Holmes in a contemporary setting. Not only was this good, it was very good!<br /><br />I had intended to space the movie-length episodes out over a few weeks time. No. Didn't happen. I was so smitten that, like any love-besotted individual, I wanted to spend as much time with the object of my infatuation as possible and so I watched them one after the other until they were all finished... And I wanted more! Fortunately the second season is now available so you don't have to endure long months of deprivation like many of us did. Well, at least not until you finish those episodes as well.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|As with all of the Breaking Bad blurays picture quality is top notch with vibrant colors for all scenes and (intentional, though still highly defined), grainy effects for the more dramatic moments.<br /><br />Of all the season sets for Breaking Bad this one stands out the most due to having the biggest variety of extras spanning from deleted and extended scenes, gag reels and special featurettes.<br /><br />The most notable featurette gives an inside look at the making of Gus Fring's final scene of the season and is definetely worth a look
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoynthe little prizes and cant wait to try out other games from this developer. although the puzzle prizes confuse me a bit
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun game, different options for game play keep it interesting- I like thy you can challenge people online. good game
B0087HT36U|3.0|I have to rate this to finish the game? clever but annoying which brought the review down.<br />I enjoyed the game but as other reviewers have mentioned-having to purchase additional bombs rather than earning them is not cool.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics and fun story!  I even found my heart pounding a bit at times! I played tgis with my kids. They found it a little scary but lots of fun.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book so it started a bit slow for me but as I turned each page I became more involved with Cheryl's journey.  I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.  She made me feel that I could do it too.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Really enjoyed this series.you will just want to keep reading. The hunger games make you think how sick and twisted we are for entertainment, this book is a gentle reminder to us all that all life and privacy are precious. I  recommend,2 thumbs up:-)
B002PEP4C8|3.0|As a rape victim myself I was really hoping for the book to be more,  well,  hopeful. It was well written,  but it tendes to drag at certain points and it was almost add though she didn't over come it at all. It was sad.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Unfortunately, even Charlize Theron can't pull off the entire movie without much better acting from the Snow White character.  We finally started  listening for the times when Stewart would let the British accent would slip and just wait until we could see the menacing Queen in all her glory again.  Everyone else was \\"fine\\", Charlize was glorious, Stewart oh so overacting.  Sorry, even with Charlize, I can't recommend this.
B00846REIS|2.0|Honestly whoever said this novel was as good as Fifty Shades of Grey was way off base. It so wasn't and I found myself bored most of the book. There was no excitement in it except the sex screens and there were only a few. :(
B000P0J0D8|1.0|I only watched a few minutes of this movie and quickly decided that it was a huge waste of time.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
630469654X|5.0|Clear picture, good quality product.  A fun movie where the \\"good guys\\" win.  Lots of swords and action!  Good comedic relief.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I think that after getting married with Costello , Diana had unfortunately changed the way she played the piano and so how her terrific music touched our heart .<br />I have no words to describe my deception with this album!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I only read the series because everyone was talking about it, and I was suprised . I thought it was a good story line.
1118026470|3.0|So as a book I will have to say this is a source of information, however, on the other hand it's very deceptive because in order to get the full benefit of the book you really have to:<br /><br />1. Buy the professional version of Burp Suite which the author wrote.<br /><br />It would have been nice if some sort of time trial was included.<br /><br />2. If you want to access any of the labs they talk about in the book you have to subscribe to their training site which is from what I can tell $7.00 an hour...<br /><br />There are a great many good and free services out there, and personally I feel the this book (while having good material) was really written to support the authors sales efforts.<br /><br />I would have much rather seen the use of free websites and examples that didn't cost any more money.<br /><br />*shrug*<br />It's ok
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I believe all these modern popular stories are written by a collective of factory workers. They all seem identical and boring. So I'll start by saying if you like all the popular modern books such as Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Da Vinci Code, etc, then you will like these. As for me they are filth.<br />First off the writing is so boring. I do not believe you can have the characters just say what they feel and want. In order to be a good book I have to be able to imagine myself in their position and what I would feel. These books just state facts and how the characters feel. See Dickens on how to make the characters come alive.<br />Next is that the characters are all predictable and do what is expected of them. Everything is too linear. They do not act like real humans with emotions. No one can compare to the Russian authors in this respect but these books don't even try.<br />Continuing on I find the metaphors annoying and childlike. \\"Red like blood\\" I have read about a hundred times in this book. Yes, I know blood is red. This does absolutely nothing to describe the true color or situation to me. Again I refer to the classics as modern authors are disappointing but Dickens, London, Tolstoy could make me see the colors and situations as in a painting. In this book I just see red, yellow, blue and colors. The \\"sky is blue\\" does not show me anything.<br />Sex always annoys me in modern pieces. I read to dream of things I will never be able to do such as fly, go to space, and solve crime along side Holmes and to learn. I do want to read about something I can do. Reading about sex is stupid. I could close the book and get it in real life. I understand that people married or sleeping in the same bed will have sex. I do not need details. It adds nothing to the story. But I guess most people are lonely and prefer to read about sex or watch porn. There is playboy and the internet if you are one of these people so please keep it out of my books. I enjoy the psychology and emotion of life more than the physical aspects everybody can do every day.<br />I am sure that I am of the minority considering this gets a 4.8 on Amazon and what's popular today is American Idol, Paulo Coehlo, Jersey Shore, MTV, Harry Potter, Hunger Games and all the other stuff out there. If you like those things then this will interest you. It is entertaining in a bland and predictable way but like most modern books has no depth or character.<br />I believe that modern education has killed literature. As soon as these writers are given degrees they turn into common factory writers. Give me an ignorant author with little education that writes about something he knows or loves any day, such as Kurt Vonnegut.emotion of life more than the physical aspects everybody can do every day.<br />I am sure that I am of the minority considering this gets a 4.8 on Amazon and what's popular today is American Idol, Paulo Coehlo, Jersey Shore, MTV, Harry Potter, Hunger Games and all the other stuff out there.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is a nice diversion that ANYONE can play. It's an electronic version of the old-time glass enclosed penny aracade machines where you drop coins in front of a shovel inside the machine in the hopes of pushing existing coins and other prizes into a well opposite the shovels' origin. There are tricks and strategy to placing the coins but they are not required to succeed in the game. The game encourages you to have the game running for extended periods of time to \\"earn\\" more coins to deposit (not an issue on my kindle fire or other device you might use while charging), and there are also options to buy coins. If purchasing game for use by kids (or are inclined to impatience yourself), beware of this coin purchase option. It is possible to earn enough coins (at least a few hundred, I'm over 10,000) that waiting to earn enough to play will not be an issue. Overall, a fun and easy game to play with nice feedback in the form of color and sounds.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I haven't been playing that long, but it's pretty good so far. Works wonderful on the Kindle Fire. Sucks you have to renew your membership every three months.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been many months since I read \\"Wool\\" but, when I noticed that the book was on sale again, the story line instantly returned to me.  I read a lot of books, and it takes a real winner to 'stick.'  If you like stories about possible futures -and the many ways in which mankind can lose (and find) its way- you'll love \\"Wool.\\"  Wonderful characters in an environment that resonates, repels and enchants.
1416562605|3.0|The White Tiger has three main strengths. For a start, as mentioned by other reviewers, it's short. The author doesn't waste a lot of ink and paper getting to the point. Also, behind the superficially radical idea of the novel being a series of emails from its narrator to the Chinese Premier, it's really a traditional novel with a plot. There's nothing clever like magic realism happening here - thank goodness - just a story with a beginning, middle and ending. It's also obvious that the author is familiar with contemporary India and comfortable about talking about its underbelly.<br /><br />Beyond this, I struggled to see why this novel won the Booker Prize (UK equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction). The plot is not particularly original - think \\"The talented Mr Ripley\\" in India with added social comment - and I found myself starting to lose interest in the anti-hero narrator and his flawed master well before the final denoulement. One of the plot's major turning points - a road accident fuelled by alcohol - felt like a cliché.<br /><br />When I think of some of the great books that have been short-listed for the Booker prize in the past and haven't won - eg Empire of the Sun, I can only assume that 2009 was a fallow year for fiction.<br /><br />This book is quite good - but not a classic. It could make a good film, though, and in the right director's hands may even end up as one of those rare films which is legitimately better than its source novel. Hollywood take note!
034580404X|5.0|got this as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend. It has been less than 3 weeks and she is almost done with the trilogy and can't stop talking about the series.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Love this show!  Sheldon cracks me up in every scene he is in.  Will be glad when I can purchase all seasons!
B008S4FZ6E|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this, having been a fan for years it was nice to get the inside thoughts from a young John Taylor, so the beginning of the book was great for me, well written and paced, but for a true fan I thought lacking somewhat in juicy bits. Maybe in a few years time we'll get Volume 2. The end seemed rushed and lacked the fervour of tales from John's youth.<br />Having said that I'm well versed in the ins and outs of Duran Duran so maybe for someone not as curious as I this is a perfectly balanced insight into the life of John Taylor, an interesting read, fan or no.
B00785P2QC|2.0|When I was building my playground I was about to add a house and then adds always pop up.This app would be really fun if it didn't have adds.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an accomplished conclusion to a very well-constructed trilogy.  Greatly enjoyed reading, and thinking about the moral questions raised. Will recommend to my children.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|When I started the book I thought whats this all about, it wasn't long before the characters were forming and I was getting absorbed into the life and losses of each character. An extremely well written book, with warmth, giving  insight and making us reflect on ourselves and what our actions would have been in those circumstances.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have played puzzle games, and I have played hidden object games. This combines them both and is by far the best game that I have played since getting my Kindle. I want more JUST like this!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I ordered the Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Seasons 1 and 2 for my 89 year old mother.  She loved the series until she got to the last disc and it was cracked.  I went online and tried to contact Amazon to see if they could just replace the damaged disc but I had to choose to return the defective Season 2.  When I choose to return it I was not given the option to have it replaced.  I want the season 2.  I cannot find anywhere on Amazon to contact customer service so I decided my only option was to write a review.  The product is great if part of it wasn't broken.  Amazon is great except that now I cannot figure out how replace this defective disc only return it.  Will someone please contact me about this?  I do not want to place a negative review on your review site but I want a replacement.  I don't just want to return the item for a credit.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I saw Adele sing a song from The Royal Albert Hall on You Tube. I was so impressed i bought the whole concert on DVD immediately. I have already watched it twice and i cried both times. And will probably cry when i watch it again.  Adele interacts a lot with the audience and is very funny.Absolutely brilliant!! I love it!!
0439023521|5.0|I am the least fan of violence but this book has so many other layers that I could not put it down.<br />Read all three books back to back in a week and a half. Well written and engaging.
B0031569HE|5.0|The book is great!And the price is great too.I think that if you can only have one book for the GMAT test,it's your first choice.Highly recommend!~
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|i love the watch very beautiful very masculine although i usually wear it on my left arm it is a watch for right handed persons
0525953728|3.0|I've read many \\"real life\\" accounts & this seemed to me to be a forced story that didn't flow well.  It left me feeling uneasy and with the thought that undercover ops are planned & executed in secret for a reason.  Some details just shouldn't be made public.
034580404X|4.0|I think the author used almost every sexual attraction available between the sexes to keep you on the edge waiting for the next chapter to begin..where will it all end..Normal won't suffice !  Thanks...Lorraine
B004SBX112|4.0|This is a great game. My 3 year old nephew loves it.  I've had no issues whatsoever. I would recommend it to anyone.
B008XG1X18|4.0|works well most of the time. sometimes it freezes up when I'm trying to pin something. that's annoying, but it only happens occasionally. I like that it puts pinterest at my finger tips so I don't need to pull out my laptop.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I thought it was awesome, obviously.  I am so glad I didn't scroll down before I watched it though.  I think it is terribly rude to write out the entire plot and then have two sentences with reviews.  Either you like it or you don't. It was exactly as I would have pictured a Tim Burton film to be.  A very funny, dark, and slightly mysterious movie this definetly is! Forgive me for my spelling.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was a fast paced, action packed conclusion to the previous two books. As in the previous books numerous twists were interlacted into the  plot.
B008MM9630|3.0|this game is very addicting but as a free app it should be a FREE app. you have to pay to get anything accomplished including expanding the farm to make it big enough to earn enough coins to spend on stuff. most stuff you have to pay real money for.
B0082Z1CVQ|2.0|I realize this book was free -- good deal! But, I selected this book to read outloud to a woman in a nursing residence who cannot see good enough to read herself.  Her hearing is also an issue.  Therefore, I read loudly.  The errors in spelling make the flow of reading aloud difficult.  Otherwise, it gets the point across.  My mom read this book to me when I was little, and therefore wanted to share it.
B009CPGHDI|5.0|It is awesome to see someone work so hard to get where their at and then to see that everything doesn't work out the way it should. She is one hell of a performer and trooper.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Excellent book, reading with the Kindle version is such an experience, which I have never had before. Thank you, Amazon.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I'm a Barbie Collector, I liked the detail of the doll and character, very impressed with the looks of the doll, great add to my collection.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie is one of the all time greats of the 80s. The movies of today simply do not capture the genuine feel of a movie that earns its merit through a great story and superb direction without taking itself too seriously. This is done in this film. The actors genuinely seem like they are on this adventure at times and reminds me of the freedom of childhood and a bike.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The characters were realistic and likeable from page one to the end.  I enjoyed the ending of the book.  I would recommend purchasing this book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is great for using Pinterest, a little glitchy and will shut down unexpectedly sometimes but a must-have in my opinion. I'm sure they'll fix the issues soon..
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I was not able to finish this book because it was too boring.  When someone told me what the book was about, which I didn't understand from reading the book, I was very surprised as I didn't get it!
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC NEWS is my number one news place! There is so much news that the U.S. new dose not even bother with. And it covers more world news too. Love my BBC news. Even have it on my lap top but not the phone yet. Thankyou Amazon for getting this app. And keep ot up BBC.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its a great site to see what the rest of the world is doing in fashion crafts and ideas.the t shirt link was especially useful for great projects that anyone could do.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Well, if you read the first in this series, and plan on reading the last one, you have to read the middle book too. The first 1/3 is a major bore. I wasn't sure if I could get through it. It gets much better toward the middle, but it is a small glimmer of awesomeness in a dark hole of muddled political story. Follet tries too hard to get as many characters as possible in every event that occurred during this time in history. Many of the story lines and character's personal histories are too much alike to be very believable. Follet is one of my favorite authors, so I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but this book is not as good as the first. Hopefully the third one is better.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The movie is a slowed down version of the book and lacks the emotional impact of the novel. The movie plot pretty much follows the book. However, one most realize that the movie is primarily targeted for a young audience and, for this audience; the movie will be a big success. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role and young women will love her (in fact, a lot of young male viewers will also love her!). My main complaint is the lack of character development for the contestants in the games. The game contestants are given no personality and when they are killed, who cares? It is like inanimate objects being killed. Another aspect of the movie is the shaky camera work. In order to obtain a PG rating, a shaky-cam approach is used for the violent action scenes. This renders the most violent scenes without emotional impact and certainly leaves the movie viewer feeling detached from the action.<br />If you are young, you will love this movie. For adults who have read and loved the book, the movie is worth seeing. But do not expect the same emotional impact. For adults who have not read to book (if there are any!), don't waste your time on the movie.
B007PFD90G|3.0|Salman Rushdie's Memoir, Joseph Anton, takes the reader with him through his \\"fatwa\\" after the publication of his novel Satanic Verses.  His descriptions of the reactions of the public, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and family are universal, but also give us insight into the power of fear and anxiety created by Muslim outrage.  Unfortunately much of it reads like a diary that is meant primarily for the writer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. At the library, it is in the young adult section but I think it is for everybody - this book was selected as the local town read, which tells me that it is for old and young alike.  The characters are interesting and I really liked the relationship that developed in the book. It is a wonderful story - filled with romance, sadness, and a very thoughtful ending.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have been an avid Lee Child and his super non-hero, Jack Reacher, fan for the last decade. I eagerly have anticipated and purchased all of his novels. I have followed Reacher from Montana to Colorado to Georgia to New York City to Washington D.C., and I have enjoyed every stop along the way. After this book, I am sad to say that Child has reached a new low. This is by far the worst book of the Reacher series, and it isn't even close.  While some element of suspending disbelief is requisite for reading any of the Reacher novels, this one combines incompetency of law enforcement and FBI agencies to a level that is hard to follow. Reacher, who I have admired for years for his tough-guy physicality with his uncanny ability to remember facts and monitor his internal clock, has been turned into some kind of autistic sauvant, who is fascinated with miles from place to place, reciting random facts and figures like an Vegas card counter. Child has a knack for creating fictional local flair across the country but has apparently run out of locales to describe, so he has taken to focus on generic FBI hiding places and miles from exits to interstates.  Reacher's opponents have turned from formidable opponents into cartoonish buffoons that he mows down like they are in a video game.<br /><br />I love Lee Child's Reacher's novels, but I would encourage him to revisit the past. An aging middle age tough guy, particularly when he is running up against improbable plots and government conspiracies and incompetencies beyond comprehension, is getting tough to follow. \\"The Affair\\" was a great novel and I truly enjoyed both of Child's Reacher novelettes, including the recent \\"Deep Down.\\" Please, Child, take us back to Reacher's days of being an incredibly talented and tough military cop. Let Reacher settle down with a good woman and retire - and write stories about his life in the 80's and 90's ... before he qualified for AARP and needed Geritol to get out of bed. Once again, make us believe in the unbelievable, a solitary warrior who redeems injustices with a passion and zeal not seen in any other character.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is oozing with patriotism, excitement and a dash of humor seasons it perfectly. I saw the author on 60 Minutes, and he said his buddies suggested he write the book because he's a better writer than they are. They're right, he's an excellent writer. Writing should be his civilian career. My brother bought the book the day after it was released and loved it. He recommended it, and I put it on my Kindle right away.  It's almost impossible to put down! I've recommended it to my son and he plans to get it on his Kindle so he and his girlfriend can both read it. I've told others about it as well and will continue to spread the word.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book really sucks. It is basically a  horribly written copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. Gideon and Eva are not at all likable and the story is rushed I wish I could get a refund. How can someone get away with blatant plagiarism?
B004AQR24W|2.0|waste of time.  Stallone looks like a smashed bag of onions.  I have tried to finish this movie twice and have fallen asleep both times.  Again, Stallone looks like a smashed bag of onions.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I love reading this series. I sometimes wish though when Rose is with Dimitri as a Strigoi, she would change. Yeah I know then it wouldn't be a story. I personally would change for my love.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Some books change everything they change the colors you see the smell, sounds and you never feel the same way again. I know I will re-read this book in a few years. Would I recommend this book as a must read? Yes. Will everyone understand maybe if they the time are patient and understand that by the end you will understand/know how you started your journey.<br /><br />Happy reading :)
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Ken Follett has meticulously researched the background to the novel. I loved the human side to this story and the way he has balanced all the countries stories so well. I did however feel it was too detailed in parts. I founf myself skimming at times. I would recommend this book. It shows a very real side to World war 2

B009GEOLM4|1.0|I have no idea if this is any good as a cartoon, but as a casual movie kinda guy I thought it would be the latest Batman movie.  The cover certainly looks legit and the name sounds about right.  This is awfully close to the scam line in my opinion, especially since Amazon has a no returns policy on digital content.  This movie is probably making a killing on here, and I'm sad to have contributed $5.  Lesson learned:  Read the reviews and don't just look at the cover.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have been a Jack Reacher fan up until this latest book.<br />This book is too long with repetitiveness and too disconnected<br />with a ridiculous conclusion. If there is to be another<br />try to stick to the format.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I felt it was a little too disjointed.  I thought the author was trying to hard to be too cool in his writing.  I thought it would never end.  It went on and on with very little suspense.  One word, \\"boring\\".
B007CGLRWA|4.0|Realistic and somewhat disturbing view of challenges faced by teachers and guidance counselors.  Very good performances by lead and supporting cast.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|We are all a mixture of good and bad, black and white, back and forth, etc., but usually by middle age, we kinda know who we are. I don't believe Hoover ever got any comfort in  life, trying to accomplish unreachable goals, of trying to sort out his sexuality, of not having a social life except for for his sidekick Tolsen, and of having an over-protective mother.  He held many significant secrets about the governing parties, and used them to his advantage in controlling the direction of the country, some good and some not so good.  He could be ruthless and was a liar at times. He is an example of an unchecked man having too much power and possibly going off in a dangerous direction for the citizenry.  Leonardo of course was excellent and any work by Clint is always topnotch.  A good movie for a review of an important man of 50 years in federal law enforcement. Well done!
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I usually love Blake Crouch's books.....Locked Doors, Desert Places Snowbound, Abandon.  This was just too far fetched and extremely disappointing.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I didn't really like to read,but HOLY COW!!!!! This  book dragged me in and couldn‘t stop reading!!! Every time I had a couple minutes to spare, you‘d find me reading this book. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really want to give this book 3 1/2 stars.  It is hard to relate to people with so many issues going on in their lives so I just had to put the book down for a time before I could go on reading.  I realize that the passing of time in a book is much faster than time in real life but this couple just can't catch a break.  Just when I thought things were going to work out it seemed like not even a day went buy with out some extreme drama.  That being said, I will have to buy the 3rd book in the trilogy just to see how it ends or what else can possibly happen to threaten their relationship.  I can't imagine dealing with anyone in real life that has as many emotional issues as the two lead characters but it is worth the read as it is so well written.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love angry birds, it is a great game to have to pass the time. I recommend this for all ages, keep angry birds a coming.

B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book was reccommend to me by a friend and my mother as while. I first read the first chapter on Google books. I fell in love with it. It was a masterpiece. I read it in two weeks due by reading another book. I read it on the bus to a soccer game and after I finish, I stared at the window and thought about the book. The next day, my friend and I just was in math class when I told her a read it. And she was just telling me her onpions of the book and of the last reason. I hope this review helps you get hooked on a journay of Hannah Baker.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed each character and how they interacted with each other.  How the author dealt with the slavery issue was delicate but still let the reader get a little taste of how the slaves themselves felt.<br />.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Well fans craped all over WOAD for being too happy sounding and \\"pop\\" huh? So now they should be happy, Wrecking Ball is jammed full of anger and tough driving music. Musically this offering has shades of Seger Sessions which is refreshing especially for fans like myself who loved that era of Bruce's career. Lyrically this album recalls not only SS but every phase of Bruce's post Born To Run canon. A solid 5 star Springsteen album.<br /><br />Note: my review is centered on the 11 song version of this record, the 2 bonus tracks would have been better off being saved for Tracks 2.
B00513DGIO|5.0|Modern economics - and macroeconomics in particular - has degenerated into something akin to astrology. It is full of arcane, pseudo-scientific formulae and assumptions that squeeze the world into categories and patterns that resemble nothing we experience in our daily lives. Its ability to guide and predict social behaviour is laughably inaccurate unless you are a true believer. When a random guess turns out to be true, the seer is hailed as a genius, an oracle, and people are desperate to believe. It is both telling and of little surprise that many of the most perceptive insights into economic behaviour are now coming from other disciplines, especially psychology and anthropology.<br /><br />David Graeber is an anthropologist and in this provocative book he dissects the notions of credit and debt, and how differing interpretations of these have driven the way people see each other and interact with each other. In the early chapters he looks at how debt has acquired moral overtones and underlines the different roles that credit has played in human societies. Economists have propagated the idea that before money we all engaged in forms of barter, but Graeber unpacks this myth and shows that it is not only illogical, but historically untrue. He explores a number of alternative theories about economic behaviour and in the process questions whether `an economy' really exists.<br /><br />Graeber sees our economic interactions as mingling three types of behaviour: communism (very much with a small `c'), exchange and hierarchy. At different times in history, the nexus between these behaviours varies quite dramatically. In a central argument of the book, he sees the rise of money and market exchanges in various epochs as inextricably linked to war, mobility and a loss of trust between people. In times of relative peace, settled existence and mutual trust, the use of money falls away and people shift to forms of communism and credit provision where money plays a limited role.<br /><br />The idea of economic cycles is not new (Nikolai Kondratiev still waves to us from the grave), but Graeber has taken a very long view of economic cycles and divides history since 3,500 BC into a number of ages: agrarian empires (3,500 - 800 BC), the axial age (800 BC - 600 AD), the Middle Ages (600 - 1450 AD), capitalist empires (1450 - 1971 AD), and the start of a new, unnamed cycle from 1971 (the death knell of the gold standard for currencies). As with all global theories, the use of evidence has to be selective and critics will no doubt be able to cite counter examples for many of the features that Graeber describes.<br /><br />For me, the most interesting part of the theory proposed here is how our thinking about credit and debt are so closely linked to the myriad ways in which we interact with each other, the level of mutual trust that we display towards each other, and ultimately the degree to which we see our fellow human beings as human at all. Graeber argues that slavery only becomes possible when debt is understood in a particular way, part of which involves treating other people as if they are solely rational, self-seeking economic actors. Hmm, now where have I heard that assumption?<br /><br />Graeber is pessimistic about the future of capitalism, but unlike economists he does not venture any predictions about how our economic relations will change over time, though he senses that the seeds of the new have already been planted. He sees the rapidly increasing use of surveillance, spin and violence on the part of modern states - their mania for control - as a last ditch attempt to prevent systemic change, but the tide of history is surely against them. How long that new tide will take to wash over us is anyone's guess: Graeber's cycles last an awfully long time.<br /><br />You might not wholly agree with Graeber's historical epochs or the way he characterises them, but his concepts of communism, exchange and hierarchy are helpful in looking at how we interact, and the different ways we interpret credit and debt over time show us that these relationships between people are not immutable. We certainly live in an age where we treat each other as less than human. You only have to look at `reality TV' or conversations on Facebook (can I really have 1,628 `friends'?) to see how little we value others and the degree to which we are willing to degrade ourselves. Much of the human story told by Graeber is depressing and drenched in cruelty, but he also shows us that it isn't always like that. Maybe there's hope for us yet.
159420411X|5.0|While occasionally longwinded, Mr. Silver does an incredible job at breaking down really complicated phenomenon into simple, understandable pieces.  It gives you a chance to step back and really think about the world, and how you think about problems.  I'm a big fan of Nate's FiveThirtyEight blog, and this book is even better.<br /><br />If they handed out a copy of this book to everyone and they actually read it, I think it would go a long way towards improving the quality of our national discourse.

0525478817|5.0|I am a high school literature teacher, and I read Fault in Our Stars and begged my school to buy the books for my students.  The school bought half the books, and I spent my own money for the other half. Absolutely, worth every penny. Watching even the  \\"cool\\" boys hide the open book under their papers because they couldn't stop reading was truly a gratifying experience.  Over and over I have assigned the classics, and no matter how exceptionally they are written, the students don't read them, and I drag the kids kicking and screaming through the chapters.  This bittersweet story with perfectly drawn, intelligent characters motivated my classes to read and keep reading. Often I heard the kids discussing it among themselves without a required assignment!! It is not a shallow read either;the book has symbolism, metaphor, complex plot,stellar vocabulary,and universal themes-all without a single supernatural gimmick. Whether a true hero's journey is from weakness to strength or strength to weakness is explored in this novel flawlessly; in addition, I could recommend it to all of my students without any fear that a parent would find some part of it inappropriate. Thank you, John Green! Finding a book that may really change one's outlook on life is so rare, but this novel does just that.
0307346609|2.0|World War Z proves how modern publishing industry works completely on high concept and almost nothing on actual substance. The title and cover design are extremely intriguing, the premise equally so. The actual writing? A complete mess. Let's go into the details of why. (Many of these points are repeated in many of the 1 and 2 star reviews.)<br /><br />1. All of the characters sound the same. That is perhaps the first and final nail in the coffin. This ranges from the Chinese doctor that discovered the disease, to the insane feral child, to the survivor of Yonkers, etc. It's all Max Brooks. The vocabulary, the syntax, the mood and style all point to the same person speaking. How can a disaster of such global proportions have everyone think and act the same way? Maybe some people loved the zombie apocalyspe. Maybe others actually thought the governments did a great job. In any event, there are a myriad of opinions. Why doesn't this so-called oral history present a more diverse range of views? It's pretty much Max Brooks talking as if he is people from other countries that he has neither visited nor really understands. Culturally offensive comes to mind when you think of the stereotypes of Palestinians, Indians, Russians, Japanese, Iranians, etc.<br /><br />[A good drinking game for fans of the book might be to take shots of liquor and then read passages from the book and guess the character that's talking. They wouldn't even get past the first shot before they'd be confused. I bet the players could take shots of Kool-Aid and still get confused.]<br /><br />2. Contrivances. Some people have pointed to the political agenda. I actually view this as a misinterpretation of the book's contrivances. A story about world governments trying to work together and people banding together to fight the zombies and deal with the plague from the very beginning would be uninteresting. You need conflict and Brooks chases the least common denominator: people were greedy, stupid, and selfish. We did ourselves in and only pulled ourselves from the brink by acting simultaneously like right-wingers or left-wingers (depending on whatever has the most shock value).<br /><br />3. Believability. Closely related to the issue of contrivance. The Battle of Yonkers is a great example of this. It so contrived as to be unbelievable. It is hard to believe that with GPS and satellites showing millions of zombies attacking, that the U.S. military would put a few soldiers with the wrong equipment in harm's way. Sounds to me like that's the moment to bring out the neutron bomb. Solve that problem quick. The same goes for the Chinese. Hard to believe that they would manufacture a war with Taiwan to hide a major epidemic rather than ask the world for assistance in dealing with that epidemic. Ditto the Iranians and Pakistanis. Sure! We have a major epidemic on our hands. Let's nuke each other. Great idea! Unrealistic to say the least.<br /><br />4. Shock value. Again closely related to the contrivance problem. Brooks wants to insert cannibalism in the story for shock value so he contrives an unbelievable situation where people just head blindly north into Canada with no plan or support at all. Like this snippet from the book: \\"He came back ten minutes later, without the radio but with this big bucket of steaming stew. It was so good!\\" It's so obvious that the goal is shock value as opposed to any sort of real narrative context. The same is true with so many other parts like the part about Dekker in the prison. Reaching for setups and payoffs, surprises, and the whole grab bag of screenwriting tools. All for shock value masked as real social commentary.<br /><br />5. Prententious. All of the above is also linked up to with how serious the book takes itself. The Zombie Survival Guide was great because it was so tongue in cheek. It was cool because it was ultimately funny. The Brooks family humor was evident. Wolrd War Z acts like what it has to say is so serious. Come on! Anyone that interprets this as legitimate social commentary has got to be kidding themselves. It's a zombie book and it tries too hard to be Romero. George Romero stumbled onto his social commentary as a byproduct of writing a great zombie script. This feels forced and artificial.<br /><br />I could provide additional analysis but I think I've made my point more or less. All of the above is part of the reason why Brad Pitt is having such a hard time getting a decent movie made from the book. The book is too episodic and its content doesn't readily come across well when delivered in a visual medium. Expect a movie that jettisons the entire structure of the novel and most of the characters and starts from scratch with just the title and a few ideas.

B008MBXFEM|5.0|I don't know that watching Batman without music would make it any less of a great movie, but I do know that this soundtrack adds so much to it. A fabulous addition to my collection!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I loved Bared to You and actually re-read it before reading Reflected In You.  I didn't seen any true character growth in this one.  Gideon and Eva were felt very shallow and one dimensional.  While they \\"learn more trust\\" in this book---at least that's what they say, I didn't see it at all.  It just left me very unsatisfied. The more intimate scenes were ok, but again, it seemed so much more just about sex than about love and developing a deeper connection with each other.  It was a good read, don't get me wrong, but I just think it could have been so very much more.  There were so many more possibilities I saw while reading this one that the author didn't explore.  I expected more........and got less than I felt we as the readers deserved.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app . I can pull up recipes or design ideals . Its easy to use and rarely has a problem w updating . Great way to share ideals w others in social media :)
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a wonderful classic, I have renewed my acquaintance with the Bennet family and friends. One irritating factor in the text was the use of -- instead of the county names, which was somewhat annoying. I presume this was due to a lack of precise editing. I would thoroughly recommend the novel to anyone who likes a timeless good read.
B0087IT8FK|4.0|This is a beautiful, magical film about an aristocratic quadriplegic who hires a young man from a different life to be his caretaker. Together they discover the meaning of life. This is a charming gem, a make-you-feel-good film, in the best French tradition of a comic-drama that takes you to acknowledge the inner beauty of human relationships. We are intrigued by one another when we concede that to be different can be interesting and inspiring, when we find a chemistry that enriches us, when relationships make us better, rounder people.<br /><br />François Cluzet is wonderful and so is Omar Sy. The music by Chopin fits beautifully. I loved every moment.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is an amazing end to this series. I only wish that they would continue. This series is a must read for all.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|This has to be one of the best Reacher books yet, and I have read most. Thanks Lee Child! Your stories are just slightly South of magnetic North and that is what makes them so much fun. When is the next Reacher adventure?
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I'm not into cartoon movies but this one is the best I've seen. The storyline is excellent and has meaning. The graphics are crisp, bright and colorful. The characters are so precious. This is one movie I'll be watching over and over again with my grandson. Absolutely perfect!
B00007AJGH|1.0|This so-called \\"anniversary edition\\" has two discs (unnecessary, really) --- one for widescreen presentation, and one for full-screen.  The first disc, the full-screen,  is supposed to have \\"family friendly\\" features but they are not present.  There are five, mysteriously-worded options on the menu, for which \\"Movie Theatre\\" leads into playing the movie, one is for options (language, subtitles, etc.) and the other three (which includes \\"Cartoon Studio\\") are inaccessible.  The first disc is supposed to contain the three cartoon shorts that came with the movie (\\"Tummy Trouble,\\" etc.) but they are not available.  Instead, \\"Cartoon Studio\\" just merely and lamely directs one to insert disk 2, and of course, they are not on that disc.  I supposed I COULD stick the disc in my computer to see if I can find the missing cartoons, but I'm so annoyed now that I would rather just get rid of the entire package.<br /><br />But more than that, I keep wondering, why is this movie so popular?  It was great the way they combined live action with animation, but other than that gimmick, this movie has absolutely nothing going for it.  The \\"humor\\" consists of either gags that were old when I was young (and that's old) or new gags that just aren't funny.  Moreover, the character of Roger Rabbit is thoroughly unlikeable; one actually keeps hoping that he gets \\"gacked\\" so that he won't be heard anymore.  And \\"Jessica Rabbit\\" is not an anthropomophized rabbit at all, but a caricature of Rita Hayworth that's so exaggerated that she's rather annoying too.<br /><br />Moreover, this is NOT a \\"family picture\\" or even a movie for kids --- one of the scenes at the beginning, where the villain (Christopher Lloyd) slowly murders a living toon, who was begging and pleading for mercy, by dipping him into dissolving acid, was disturbing even for an adult.<br /><br />The animation, I admit, is beautiful, but even there, I founed the colors to look very pastel and washed-out; not at all as bright and vibrant as they could have been.  Considering how much this movie was built up before I saw it, this is a major, unfunny disappointment.  I ended up leaving this package downstairs in the laundry room for whoever wanted it, but I'm thinking, on second thought, I should have just broken the discs and thrown them out.  As a homage to old cartoons, it's a minor bit of fun.  As a story, it's a total wash-out, just like the colors in its cartoon parts.ant as they could have been.

B008PNBU30|5.0|I loved this album.  They keep getting better and better.  For those of you that wrote \\"HUGE Disappointment\\", if you want to hear the same song redone a thousand times listen to nickelback.  This was a great cd and I love the fact that when you buy 3DG it is something new and different everytime.  LOVED it guys!
B002TX06RI|5.0|I will admit that often I ignore some of the shows that my streaming television recommends.  Probably for the past six months or more, I've consistently passed over White Collar after reading the synopsis.  It just didn't interest me. I'm not a crime buff.<br /><br />Okay, I know this is going to sound really lame, but after reading Fifty Shades of Grey and women thinking that Matt Bomer would make the perfect Christian Grey, I decided to see what all the hullabaloo was about over this good looking guy.  As a result, I started watching White Collar.<br /><br />Instantly, I got sucked into a show that I thought I would never be interested in.  Matt Bomer plays the con-man Neal Caffrey, who cuts a deal with the FBI to shorten his prison time if they allow him to work as a consultant with the guy who put him behind bars in the first place.  Peter Burke, played by Tim DeKay, is the agent that decides to give Neal a chance.  Of course, he's on a tight leash with a tracking device around his ankle that only gives him a two-mile radius in New York City when he's by himself.<br /><br />What can I say about this show? For someone who is NOT into crime shows, White Collar is probably the best show I've seen in a long time. It's my type.  Why? The violence is very tame, there's no cursing, the sexual situations are tempting, but there's no graphic sex, the suspense is a killer at the end of every episode, and the characters are people that you fall in love with and become emotionally involved in their lives. Besides all of the above, the relationship between Peter Burke and Neal Caffrey is a joy to watch.  You get so attached to them both, that you sit there and worry about each of them every episode.<br /><br />Frankly, after watching this show, I think I missed my calling as a writer for TV show. Bravo to those that pen this fantastic series. Every episode, of course, focuses upon another white collar crime and bad guy that needs catching. However, every episode is rich with undertones of the secondary story of Neal's loves, life, secrets, and struggle to go straight. Peter's underlying motivation is to see Neal, who he has become friends with, turn away and leave the life of crime. The questions looms, once a con man, always a con man? You should tune in to find out.<br /><br />I streamed seasons one-three, and am currently watching season four on Amazon.  Only two left to go and then I'll be in the desert with no Neal Caffrey, Mozzie (his side kick), Peter's wife, and the rest of the cast.  Love them all!  White Collar was picked up for Season 5, but alas, I don't have USA Network.  I may have to remedy that situation come January.<br /><br />Anyway, as usual, I'm probably the last to stumble across this treasure of a television program.  If you are a late comer, like myself, take note. You won't be sorry.undertones of the secondary story of Neal's loves, life, secrets, and struggle to go straight.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger Games is an interesting look at how violence and war affect young people.  If you have a child who is reading the book, make sure to read it yourself and talk about it.  I found that in talking with my 11-year-old, he completely missed the point on why the children were being chosen to participate in the Games and how that affected their lives from day one.  Definitely gives parents/mentors a good deal of relevant topics to discuss with their young people.
B000X1Z0BU|2.0|The video was well packaged, but of poor quality.  At times, the video and sound track did not match, and the general quality of the video was poor.  I am not sure if this was a \\"bootleg\\" shot on a hand-held camera in the movie theater, but it was not at all first quality.<br /><br />I am disappointed with this purchase.

B00631VJIC|5.0|I really enjoyed all of the songs on the dvd.  I think the singers did an awesome job.  I usually don't care for songs that are re-done by other artists, but surprisingly, I loved them.  Great job!
