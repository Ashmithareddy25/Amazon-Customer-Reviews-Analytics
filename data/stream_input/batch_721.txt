0316067598|5.0|Awesome account of life as a NAVY SEAL.  I just wish all of them made it back.  After reading this book, sit back and think what would have happened if they did not have to worry about the media and being court martialed.  If they were allowed to do their job without hesitation, I do not think there would be a lone survivor but multiple survivors.

B00008DYQA|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  No question.  Gyllenhaal and Spader deliver the most delicious, sensual, and innocent love story I have ever seen in film.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the plot is ground-breaking.  I do not imbibe in the S&M lifestyle, but this movie made me wish I did!  It is, without a doubt, the sweetest hard-core love story ever made.    My suggestion: Watch the movie once, then immediately watch it again with the sound off, so you can appreciate the beautiful staging and use of color without getting wrapped up in the dialogue again.  If you are not absolutely blown away by the opening scene, you need a CAT-scan.  My only complaint (which is hardly a complaint) is that there could have been a little more background on Mr. Grey.  I wish I could know a little more about his life before Lee, such as his ex-wife, the other secretaries, etc.  Other than that, this movie is flawless without being preening, passionate without being contrived, innocent without being trite, and so erotic without being overtly-sexual.  Watch it!  Watch it!  Watch it now!
0060723513|4.0|This is a provacative book that tells a meaningful story. I was engaged in the story and hope that I learned something about the Aboriginal culture. The core question after reading the book is \\"was it real or was it fantacy?\\" which is an excellent question for people to ponder.
0099457164|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever finished. It was an insult to the reader to sit through all the descriptions of Italian life and Italian coffee. Grisham has come to the point in his career where he really has nothing more to say, but since people buy his books... what the heck! I will never, ever read another Grisham work.
0440238609|5.0|Absolutly one of the best fantasy series I have ever read. The characters are vivid and real and the plot sucks you in so fast you'll find yourself reading into all hours of the night. Absolutly fantastic, a must read.

042521771X|3.0|Mr. Knightley's Diary was just a little slow and tedious for me.  I don't think this can all be put at the feet of Amanda Grange except in her choice of subjects.  Anyone who has ever read EMMA by Jane Austen knows that Knightley is not as often at the forefront of that novel as some other Austen lead male characters.  This caused Ms Grange to use her imagination to a much greater extent in giving us Mr. Knightley's thoughts and even some of his words.<br /><br />It became rather boring reading about him dining in someone else's home practically every night.  This was the major way Ms Grange conveyed the action for this book and is, indeed, how it happened in EMMA.  The saving grace for EMMA was that we saw many, many more character interactions for that main character and since she was the lead in the book, we got much more actual conversation.  I wish I had counted how many times Knightley was portrayed as walking to Hartfield.  Surely it must have numbered close to a hundred because the book covered a full year in the lives of these characters.<br /><br />Also, Mr. Woodhouse and his continual grousing just plain got on my nerves.  I don't remember having that reaction to him in EMMA so I'm not quite sure why he irritated me so sorely in this book, but he did.<br /><br />Somehow this book did not portray any passion and not very much feeling for me.  If I had never read EMMA, this book would not tempt me to pick it up.  I read Mr. Darcy's Diary by this author and rated it 4 solid, lovely stars.  This one is O.K., but the stars are mostly given out of appreciation for previous books written by this author.  I just don't think she had enough material to work with.  Mr. Knightley is certainly no Darcy or Wentworth!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Again Tarantino delivers another excellent film, with great character development and butt-clenching suspense. Already I have seen this film eight times and I have not got sick of it yet.    This extended edition has a few additions and changes. Here is a rundown: *minor spoilers*  - The first scene in the car with Jungle Julia, Shanna and Butterfly is longer, with a few extra lines here and there.  - After the scene at Guero's, there is a moment where Stuntman Mike watches the girls stumble out.  - Butterfly's lap dance scene  - Kim, Lee and Abernathy are introduced by Stuntman Mike driving into a parking lot. What follows is a reasonably large black and white sequence. This scene further develops these three girls characters, especially Lee.  - The scene in which Stuntman Mike photographs the girls has been extended, and accompanied by music that intensifies the disturbing nature of the scene.  - A few jokes and lines have been changed in the car, before the girls get Breakfast.    The DVD features are surprisingly good for a Tarantino feature. Perhaps the most interesting is a featurette explaining how they did the car crashes in the film. Also, the trailer for the documentary on Double Dare made me get out the film: which was excellent (it contains more making footage on Kill Bill than I have ever seen, among other things).    All in all, it is a great buy and well worth a watch for those who have not seen it. Perhaps a slightly more slow pace Tarantino film: but hey, nothing like having a little patience to put up with artistic beauty.    (BTW, my name is Jeremy, I am a 20 yr old male. I used my friend Laetitia's Credit Card to buy the film, therefore her name is on the top of the review.)
0679731369|5.0|I wish I had enough of that literary critic vocabulary and style to convey how wonderfully rich FLAUBERT'S PARROT is.

0156027321|3.0|I had heard remarkable things about this book.  How deep it was.  How gripping its survival story became.  How much it makes people think.<br /><br />In this book, a teenager, who grew up on a zoo and who spent much of his time in his religious devotions, loses his family members when their boat sinks.  The teenager survives on a lifeboat with several other animals, one of which is arguably a tiger.<br /><br />This was a good book, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The first one hundred pages are, by and large, a discussion of the behaviors of animals and the natures of different religions.  This is definitely interesting, engaging stuff, but it does not make for great fiction.  In truly GREAT fiction, I can lose myself and experience the characters in my mind's eye.  But I couldn't lose myself in the first hundred pages of this book.<br /><br />The next couple hundred pages, which show an improvement, tell the story of the teenager surviving on the boat with the other animals.  Sometimes this story can be quite exciting, and the book's author really made me care for the teenager.  I really experienced his drive to survive, and his thirst and exhaustion.  I got to understand his mind.  Good stuff.<br /><br />But, even during these pages, the book was not fantastic.  Many of occurrences it described were either too random or too unbelievable.  They wouldn't have been problematic in a fantasy novel, but this book isn't a fantasy novel and it doesn't treat itself that way.<br /><br />On a different note, the action sequences were glossed over pretty quickly.  They could have been fantastic, but they weren't.<br /><br />Finally, the last chunk of the book did make me think.  But, for me, it was too late to change my opinion or perspective.<br /><br />Anyway, the book was good, it was sometimes exciting, and it did make me think.  But it wasn't anything amazing.

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Annie Lennox never disappoints me.  As usual, this is another GREEAT CD for her.  Her voice is top-knotch, the arrangements are excellent and her back-up is always the best.  I listened to this for the first time out for a short walk and wound up walking (briskly, I might add!) so much longer than I had anticipated due to the great beat.  Lennox energizes, excites and exhilarates. A wonderful CD - enjoy!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|All I have to say going to say, is it was the first film to make me cringe in a long while, from something other then wondering whos' rear hollywood has it's head stuck in. Gory it's true but with a method to the madness, and  a twisting plaot that only a fewe have mentioned they figured out before the film had finnished. I loved it.
B000003TA4|5.0|What else can be said about this album that wasn't said before? It's a classic. You can tell it's a great record because even though it's 16 years old, when you listen to it today, it doesn't sound dated. It actually feels a bit sad and nostalgic, since listening to Nevermind makes me think of how much mainstream music is lacking right now. Having grown up in the early 90's, now that I'm 27, I really can't think of another band after Nirvana that had the same impact or significance. They had the characteristic of being mainstream and actually good at the same time. RIP Kurt Cobain.
0812975219|5.0|I read Taleb's The Black Swan and was so fascinated by this author's synthesis of his experiences and knowledge that I purchased Fooled by Randomness. Taleb describes a financial world of shadows which like quantum particles becomes more uncertain the more energy we apply. Fooled by Randomness should be read by most individual investors and anyone contemplating a career on Wall Street. The price of the paperback is $14.95, less than a roundtrip trade at a discount brokerage.     Here are a few of Taleb's observations:    a. The millionaire next door may no longer be a millionaire since the market crash of 2000  b. The more frequently you review your stock portfolio, the greater your potential for unhappiness.  c. Your personal financial happiness may be related more to the wealth of your neighbors than to your own net worth.  d. The winners of the investment game may be more lucky than skilled.  e. Emotions help us make choices when the alternatives are similar.  f. Grey hair is a valuable attribute of a financial advisor.  g. The writings of Karl Popper and George Soros teach us about the unknown unknown.  h. The career of Victor Niederhoffer teaches us about the failure of naïve positivism.  i. Past performance is no indication of future performance.  j. Past performance is no indication of future performance (duplication intended).  k. I am typing this review with Microsoft Word because of network externalities and a Polya Process.  l. Jean Buridan was drowned in a sack in the Seine River in the 14th c. because he was either a post-modern saint or a pre-modern sinner.    Having successfully argued the relevance of randomness and rare events, Taleb may have begun work on his next book which will hopefully describe possible exceptions. Perhaps he will discuss the possibility that governments, investment houses and banks can hide manipulations of liquidity and asset values within these shadows of randomness and noise. Taleb might also include advice on how to wrestle our financial mental health from our justified and unjustified beliefs in causality and randomness, Apollo and Dionysus.

1582701709|1.0|Like a dark comet on a fast orbit, once every 7 years or so, there comes a book to sell (once more) the idea of...wishful thinking. I can remember at least two others, the shallow CELESTINE PROPHECY in the early 1990's and the more verbose ALCHEMIST around the millennium.<br />Right on schedule, THE SECRET came along. It too, peddles the totally unfounded idea of \\"wishing something into existence\\" as a good idea to live your life by.<br /><br />There are a great number of self-help books that encourage the appreciation of what one already has and the understanding of what one really needs - trying to shade some light on the darkness of 21st century frantic over-consumerism. And that is indeed what most psychologists will advise as the road to happiness.<br />THE SECRET, however, does the opposite: it encourages the reader to wish for even more things - and offers no means in achieving them, other than \\"really-really thinking hard about them\\". Most people outgrow this infantile illusions phase by their 5th birthday...<br /><br />This is the only situation where I can imagine THE SECRET working: if you are competing for a new position in your company, it would be wise to offer this book as a gift to all the people competing against you.<br />May I be the first to congratulate you on your promotion!<br /><br />In any other situation though,<br /><br />DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT...

B000T7FO6E|1.0|I only gave this one star because it does not represent the entire show.  If you go to the PBS website and look at the track listing you will see two listings: One of which was shown on TV and the other is the full show.  This collection is the shorter of the two, thus making this incomplete.  You would think that if they would go through the trouble of putting this out that the whole show would be included.  Also note that these songs don't even match what was shown on TV.  You must go to the PBS website to compare.  This was a great show that no one will ever see in it's entirety!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|All characters show somethings I love and somethings that I hate... Impossible to say who is the good and who is the bad guy... ! Love this movie...! Excentric and unusual.. Watch it...
B000N6TYLW|5.0|one has to wonder what was going on thru Lorelais' parents minds, upon seeing, in the last episode.  maybe that was what prompted her dad to say what he did, for both him and Emily.  no we wont ever know if her mother and her were ever able to see eye to eye or to be able to speak to one another without coming to words.  but- seeing how the whole town came together, and came out like that in only one whole day, now that was wonderful.  what child wouldnt love to hear that from their parents?  and yes i have to agree that it was a perfect way to end the show.  exactly the way it came in, making us see that in TVland, the show is going on. taylor is annoying luke, miss patty flirts endlessly with cute guys, and kirk is looking for more work.      i will definately miss this show.  initially, i was turned off by it, never having actually watched the show.  i dismissed it out of hand simply to me because it seemed too girly and stuff.  guys you know what i mean.  BUT, when my wife told me to watch a certain episode because it was JUST like when her and her mother fight constantly, i did so. and let me say it mirrored the relationship Lorelai had with her own mother.  and then i had to go back and watch the whole thing from the beginning.      Wonderful show really.  quick witted, funny, snappy one liners, good character development, and a great cast.  i miss it already.
0553805460|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, it was basically a real disappointment, with very little substance. Belfort spends an enormous amount of time of his obsessions with drugs and prostitutes, and very little on things like:    -how did he start his firm?  -why was the SEC after him?  -what happened to the money?  -what did he go to prison for and what was his life like there?    etc, etc.    Belfort also tends to almost completely ignore the reality; namely, that his firm essentially existed only to rip off the investing public. He then used this money to finance his decadent lifestyle. Nowhere does Belfort show any remorse for this thievery at all. Personally, I think he is a sorry human being with a weak writing style. Don't waste your money on this book!
B00005R5G9|4.0|Who says cast members can't elevate a romantic-comedy dud from the ashes? Andrew McCarthy, Estelle Getty, James Spader and \\"Hollywood\\" transform a clumsy farce into a memorable delight. And there is Kim Cattrall, a leggy cat with meowwwww,who transforms this clunker up to speed at every tease. The plot is complicated with other bit characters having their farcical moments as they connive to capture the brand store window competition. McCarthy and Cattrall team up early on and enjoy a campy Astaire/Rogers attraction that charms their sequences, and I mean inside one of the oldest Macy's-like buildings with colossal columns,stairways and elevators that enhances the imaginative \\"fantasy\\" dance sequences that end just as daylight freezes Cattrall in mannequin stillness,the Eqyptian princess locked in time. There are Keystone cops-like chases interrupting the teasing McCarthy/Cattrall sequences throughout, ending in a rather limp finale. One more re-write to the screenplay, though improvised heavily, would place this in classic romantic comedy instead of \\"cult\\" guilty pleasure comedy. A great date movie.

0618680004|5.0|I wasn't a very religious before, but this book did more than free me from any convictions I previously held.  It opened my eyes to the frightening strangle hold that religion has over people.  I wish I could say was articulate enough to truly hold this book in the light it deserves but alas, my best attempts would do little more than give the shadow justice.  I think my official opinion could be best described from a review from the back of the book from Penn and Teller: \\"The God Delusion is smart, compassionate, and true like ice, like fire.  If this book doesn't change the world, we're all screwed.\\"  It was amusing at first but I now share the same sentiments.
1401300529|5.0|The book was a present to my brother-in-law. He was a US Marine who fought in Korea in the winter of 1950-51. I was wondering how he would react to the description of his outfit's retreat during below-zero winter. He reacted fine, and thanked me for giving it to him. This is really a tribute to the author,David Halberstram.     I thank Amazon for making the book available at an affordable price.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I saw this movie when i was about 10 or so and I've continously caught it on tv over the years and I relly enjoyed it. ISo when I saw it on Amazon I had to buy it. i'm an 80's baby and those movies are classic ,The ones today can't compair.
B000X9PNOG|5.0|Okay - I'm VERY excited to see this thing - however - the stats Amazon US has put up are quite suspiciuos.  First of all - it lists a ONE HOUR running time - this doesn't seem right.

087033039X|5.0|.<br /><br />This is a valuable resource for leather workers an knot tyers. While many of the knots and braids are interchangeable the section on \\"mystery braiding\\" is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Good information, well presented.
0143038583|4.0|This book comes down hard on fast food and makes you think twice about corn and why so many farmers are growing it in such large quanities.  It also comes down on the organic food movement making you question what makes foods organic. It even questions the morality of eating animals making a good case for being a meat eater. I like the criticism, but the overly sentimental passages about a farm in VA and the local food movement were overdone.  Those sections felt a little like an infomerical.  Still, it was persuasive enough to get me to look at food in the grocery store in a different light.  I would recommend this book.
B0000844IT|1.0|With a title like Army of Darkness you would think this would be a cool movie but you couldn't be more wrong.  This is supposed to be one of those its so bad its good movies but it fails at being entertaining in any sort of way.  Bruce Cambell and Sam Raimi deserve to be shot dead for making this film.
0810993139|5.0|I certainly enjoyed reading this book with my children.  Right before bed, we usually read a chapter or two.  It makes my children laugh out loud.  The drawings help the reader visualize the entries within the journal.    I would certainly recommend this book and parents would find it a joy to read to the entire family.  Most pre-teen kids may relate to the journal, so I would recommend this book for any tweeny.  Excellent!  Thanks Jeff Kinney!
B00003CXD5|5.0|Several nationally recognized reviewers pick this movie as their No 1 favorite of all time. I'll not go quite that far, probably because of Bogart's performance.He starts out fine in town, but his impending paranoia, eventually bordering on madness, seems forced, abrupt,somewhat artificial,at least to this reviewer.By no means is it Bogart's best cinematic effort.Ageing Walter Huston,on the other hand, gives the performance of a lifetime,abeted no doubt by his son, director John Huston. Walter's dance of joy was given special extension and impovisation; it's the scene that first comes to mind when the movie is mentioned.Finally, never disregard the efforts of unsung Tim Holt, as much at home in the mountains or on horseback as he was as a brat in \\"The  Magnificent Ambersons\\". Holt was cast in many varying roles over the years, but his smooth, reliable work was never fully appreciated; a Martin Balsam or Simon Oakland forerunner of sorts. Anyway, regardless of where one ranks this film, it's a certified classic.
6301978587|5.0|It took me many, many years to see YENTL and I am so glad that I finally did.  What an amazing accomplishment for Barbra Streisand, in this, her directorial debut.  YENTL went on to win a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Original Song Score.  This is the film adaptation of the story written by Isaac Bashevis Singer.  It takes a look at the determination of one young woman, Yentl, and her quest for education in 1904 Eastern Europe, when young women in her village were forbidden to become literate. Raised by a Rabbi father (Nehemiah Persoff), the young girl learns the sacred text of the Telmud in secret, when the shades are drawn, and under his watchful eye.  Yentl is headstrong and fiercely determined to learn at any cost, in the face of the values imposed on women by a male dominated society.  When her father passes away, Yentl decides to cut her hair, don trousers in the guise of a young boy, in order to finally have a chance at the education she hungers for.  On the way, she encounters Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin), a fellow classmate, and his beautiful fiancee, Hadass (Amy Irving, who received a well-earned Oscar nomination for the role).<br /><br />This film is filled with beautiful music (this includes the ever popular \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me\\"), strong and engaging acting and beautiful artistic direction.  My only complaint is that this hasn't been released and distributed more widely on DVD in the United States.  This film is worthy of preservation and carries a great message about the triumph of the human spirit and the emancipation of women in the face of great obstacles and social oppression.  We are truly privileged that Ms. Streisand brought YENTL to the screen with such success.  Highly reccomended.
0767020308|4.0|Very well done indeed. I would recommend this for any one who is a Jane Austen fan. Kate Beckinsale's performance is outstanding.
0609610570|3.0|When I brought this book, my attention was to focus on personal and business execution. There was no personal execution which obviously discouraged me from reading the whole book.

1592332803|2.0|There are a lot of recipes here to choose from.<br />But several things bother me:<br />She did not include nutritional information about<br />the recipes. Yeah, you should have included calories<br />and sodium information, just because it is vegan doesn't mean<br />it is not fattening.<br />There is also a significant amount of white flour, it doesn't<br />look like the author made a bit of an effort of adding more<br />whole ingredients. She also relies a lot on Egg replacer.<br />Some other 'Staple' recipes come from other books, which is<br />annoying since I expect to get new recipes when I get a new cookbook.<br />The brownie recipe is eatable, but could be better and no, it does not fit in a 8x8 container, we used a 9x11. Still I think<br />something was missing in that recipe.<br />There are some good ideas thou, like how to make condensed milk.<br />I would rather recommend Sweet treats cookbook, Isa Chandra's, Millenium for desserts, and of course Fran Costigan's
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Despite all the hoopla over Ken Burns' \\"The War\\", I was a bit let down, feeling it lacked something.  It did stir a memory however, of a very compelling series I had seen, in part, as a boy.  \\"The World At War\\" was the series and I have found it to be even better than my boyish memory of it.  It is so completely comprehensive.  Each episode deals with a particular aspect of the war, such as the \\"Final Solution\\", the Fall of France and D-Day, in completion so you get the full impact of the theme of each chosen episdoe, from inception to the end of the war, rather than getting mixed details on a strict timeline for the war as a whole.  This results in overlap, which actually brings more clarity and understanding to the war as a global phenomena, experienced so differently at the same moment by so many people.  I wonder why schools don't just run this documentary and then have class discussions on it, as it is so perfectly laid out for understanding and in-depth study.  Enjoy Ken Burns' work by all means, but get this collection if you want to really understand WWII as the beast that changed our world forever.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Much more deliberate studio recording.  Lacks the wild, free structure of the old days of E Street.  Still a great album with great writing.  Springsteen fans should purchase without reservation.
1401200923|3.0|I gotta be honest...after Jeph Loeb's involvement in Heroes, I was expecting something pretty special here in Hush Vols. 1 and 2.  Yet...not so much.  I'm not a hardcore comic fan, but I was immersed by The Dark Knight Returns and Gaiman's Sandman...Hush is really a Batman mystery for serious fans.  One gets the idea the story worked better in monthly installments that raised questions and expectations at each turn over a year's time (editors hint that there were huge arguments in the fan community as to who the real villain of the piece was).  The payoff, unfortunately, is much more a whimper than a bang when you read the stories in a few sittings as I did.  It's very much a serialized story in the classic sense of bygone days...but I'll admit, I'm a graphic novel buyer, and I dig on stories that have a deeper core than tons of bad-guy cameos, which is what one has here.  The art is great and fun to look at, and this is not to say that the story has no merit.  It does.  I was going to check out Long Halloween...but now I'm not so sure...

B000O77SOK|5.0|THE PRACTICE VOLUME ONE    Having only discovered The Practice because of my fondness for James Spader and William Shatner, I took the plunge and bought this DVD release. The first thing I noticed is that the DVD only has 13 episodes. So it includes the first season with the pilot and half the second season. I can't see any logic in releasing the first volume in this half arsed way. It must be a legal thing.    As for the show itself, I thought it was excellent. The cast is talented and likable. The scripts are tight and intelligent. All in all this is a very good show and I cannot recommend it highly enough. As a final note, I hope the seasons, which include Shatner and Spader, are released soon as that was the prime reason for my investment in this smart show.

Most of the book takes place in the 60's/70's following the life of the 20 year old protagonist, Toru, who is in love with his dead friend's girlfriend. There was a mini epidemic of teenage suicides during this time in Japan and Norwegian Wood touches on that topic. Murakami develops rich and complex characters like Midori and Reicho (2 friends of the protagonist).     The story is narrated by the protagonist's older self at the age of 37. You gain a better understanding of modern Japanese culture while reading a very entertaining and rich story. Very pleasant read! Highly recommended!
0877284520|5.0|no, the colours don't \\"jump off the cards\\" at you, but this is more a tool for occult study and practice than a work of art to be framed and put over the fireplace. that said, they look great to me and i'm very, very glad i found them. the included booklet has eye-bleedingly small print, but if you care that much you'll buy the companion book anyway.     another companion i'd suggest would be alan moore's interpretation of the tarot in \\"promethea\\". even if you're not into the series in general, that issue is a brilliant accessory to this deck.    in any case, you'll be glad you bought them.
0805082662|5.0|This book is still popular with kids even after 40 years!  That's gotta be worth something.  Your kids will enjoy this one for years to come and your kid's kids will probably also enjoy it.  This version looks great and will be enjoyable for years to come!

0307276902|5.0|I have been thinking of buying this book for a while, but never got around to it. Finally saw it in the bookstore and, after hearing a friend who works with addicts rave about it, decided to pick it up.<br /><br />First of all, it is AMAZING. The only negative I would give the book is the style includes no indentations and no \\"necessary\\" punctuation, but I can kind of see why he did it, and we don't fault Faulkner for his \\"stream of consciousness\\" style.<br /><br />I picked the book up at lunch and took it back to the office. I opened up the first page, planning to \\"just check\\" the author's writing style, and found myself looking up after getting about 40 pages into the book. It is engrossing, thought-provoking, gut-wrenching, emotional, and more. It is a terrific read. It really makes the reader understand the hopelessness that addicts feel when they really do hit rock bottom. It gave me a new way to look at recovering addicts.<br /><br />And to address the controversy: those who feel betrayed because they \\"trusted\\" Frey -- are complete idiots. What, did you found a religion based on his words? It was classed wrong, so what. If I were to write a 100 percent true memoir about my life, how much of it would I be able to prove? And how much of it would be way off base, because I remember it so differently than it actually happened? So what if he did make up huge parts of it? Maybe he just substituted for parts that were too painful to talk about.<br /><br />I think any memoir, written by anyone, could be found to be not 100% factual. I'd like to see one that is. It would be boring as hell. I'm sure his life really was harrowing, and it really was a horrible story, but in order to create a cohesive, understandable story, Frey did have to change some things around. Kudos to him for selling so many books. I hope he's a happy, healthy millionaire whose demons remain eternally at rest. All the furor that Oprah created would turn a lesser man back to drugs.

0060786523|5.0|This is the longest paperback book ever published. It is a big time investment that is well worth it for the right reader. Seth's writing is entertaining and he does an outstanding job developing his characters. I missed the people in the story when I finished the book. If you are interested in India and are perhaps travelling there, I strongly recommend this book if you had to only read one book on the topic.<br /><br />I imagine a lot of readers may find the political parts and speeches boring, but Seth amazingly places a well known character in the book in the midst of the political intrigue hence making the reader care more about what is happening politically. You will learn a lot about Muslim/Hindu conflicts which is an important part of life in India historically and today.<br /><br />Seth's writing may be not as poetic as Rushdie, but easily surpasses him in entertainiment value. He weaves a very intricate plot while teaching the reader Indian culture and history. There are a lot of characters and subplots in this book but amazingly Seth ties everything together - it does not even appear forced. I had little trouble keeping track of everyone. Highly recommended. I plan to read more Vikram Seth.
6305428271|5.0|It's not often that I write reviews like this, but thought I would in this case.    I remember, eerily enough, when this movie came out in 1995.  Coolio's \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" came out in August of that year and was an instant hit, topping the Billboards for two, three months straight.  I was only 13 then.    The movie itself was really good.  The acting was great and the depiction of inner-city life was stellar.  I thought it was a shame that it was only given two stars by the Movie Rating Association, but what do they know?    Everyone gets to make choices in life regardless of their situation.  One must have the drive and ambition to make the right ones.  One line that Ms. Johnson has in the film is the response to one student's statement \\"If we get on the bus, we have to put up with you!\\"  She responds, \\"Yes, but that is still a choice.  You can either [stay where you're at] or get on that bus.  That may be a choice you don't like but that's still a choice.  There are no losers in this classroom.\\"    I also like her line of \\"As of right now, everyone in here has an 'A'.  It's up to you to keep it.\\"
B000VT6FAO|3.0|All the girls who were looking for Paper Monsters 2: Electric Boogaloo, prepare to have your hearts broken.    I find it amusing that so many of the reviews I read tout a 'mature sound' from Mr. Gahan. My first listen through the album, I felt like I was trapped in someone's diary. While Dave Gahan (and friends) look fantastically cool and aloof and wise in the B&W pictures splashed through the CD booklet, and while the album may indeed *sound* mature, the lyrics read something more akin to my high school's literary magazine entries. Alas, as Eddie Izzard made famous, it's \\"70 percent how you look, 20 percent how you sound, and 10 percent what you say.\\"    There are lusty little poems that seem to strain themselves to be evil, gritty and perverse. There are rambling tracks that seem to point to something more personal but fall short of that fundamental understanding that Depeche Mode's music has always given us, as such things may often do. Soulful crooning, classic Dave, opens our hearts to something deep and intellectual, and is immediately followed by manufactured sound that takes a step over the Depeche Mode fan's desire for electronic sound, gives it the bird and beats it to death with a rusty wrench.     There is that certain electronic sound, to be sure. It appears as a constant pulse through a good portion of the album. It's the same sound, and at times it feels as if it's being ignored as a nuisance because it doesn't quite match what's written on the paper. Some of it's fantastic. Some of it is just fantastically cheesy.    DM fans are perhaps used to something a little more polished, so while this album may indeed be fantastic for those looking for this kind of sound, it may also disappoint many who were hoping that the entire album will feel like whatever it is that Gahan's done previously that fans really liked and wished he would emulate for the rest of his career.     Reviews of this product will probably be very similar to those of Radiohead's new-ish album, In Rainbows. Fans who all enjoy Kid A insist that every subsequent album should sound or be manufactured in a similar fashion. As a result every album released by anyone associated with the group is compared to that Kid A to see if it matches or not. The same seems to be happening with Hourglass.    For those of you who love Mr. Gahan's smooth and deep voice because he gives you that mushy feeling, or turns you on, or incites whatever feel-good feeling that he does through the magic of Depeche Mode, know that in this album he feeds himself. There is little fan-service to be had here, ladies. Perhaps this will allow listeners to enjoy Gahan as a musician and not as a playboy.
B000063UR2|5.0|In 1985, I saw Legend and thought that it was beautiful. The main tale followed the innocence (or perhaps the word \\"ignorance\\" might be a better selection) of two humans as they screwed up the world by meddling with good personified (unicorns). O those pesky humans.<br />It was a beautiful outing, too. The prosthetic effects were done really well and, as far as a fairytale goes, Ridley Scott put on a damn fine tale. That was the beautiful of Scott back then; he could put together a story and hire the right teams to make a movie wayyy beyond its time. Good thing, too, because old movies do not always age gracefully.<br /><br />Watching Legend again some 20 + years later, I noticed that some of the effects had aged but that the story was still intact. The minor characters were also a bit more entertaining than I recalled, nobody really died in the movie (the \\"sea hag\\" only took a sword and sort of swirled into the water and the \\"dinner\\" being chopped up didn't actually die on screen), and that there were buckets of glitter kicking it in the forest. Still, it wasn't the reminder of childhood that made me happy BUT the fact that it was still a great watch.<br />O that Tim Roth - what a sexy beast.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie for some odd reason, it is a good watch and one that is cheap to obtain. It does have some places where it shows its age, but it is a fairytale and doesn't really use anything that can seem too outdated when watch.<br />And that Lord of Darkness and his little rhyming goblin - they make for a good watch on their own.
1400063515|5.0|Coming up with novel ideas and concepts for a book is a not a trivial task. Specially after a very successful book, it is even more challenging. So what do you do? Well, take the key concept from your previous book, respin it in a different way, recycle original ideas with different name(say \\"Invisible Evidence\\" instead of \\"Survivorship bias\\") ... add some page fillers and there you go ... you have \\"The Black Swan\\".     Anyway, all in all it is nice book. Specially for the folks who haven't read \\"Fooled by Randomness\\". It covers the same ground but from different angle. What I liked about this book is that compared to \\"Fooled by Randomness\\", it is lot more prescriptive. NNT has done a decent job of providing ideas to convert the black swan to a gray swan. Another thing I like about NNT is his defiance for authority and it is clearly stands out all throughout the book. As regards to writing style, I would like to nit-pick a bit. There were just too too many footnotes(and some were really huge footnotes). I would suggest that going forward please relegate the footnotes towards the end of the book. Another thing I would like to nit-pick about is the use the \\"F\\" word. Come on ... you could have definitely dropped it without losing any impact. Please kindly do not use the \\"F\\" word in your future writing. Additionally, I did not like is the use of words Extermistan and Medicristan. To be politically correct, Extremeland & Mediocreland would have been more appropriate.    NNT quite admits that if you want to sound credible then you have to leverage some of the credible entities. He has used this concept to the fullest by bashing Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, Gauss and other smart scientists. It is clear that if you cannot convince then the best strategy is to smudge the credibility of the Noble laureates. You can fool one, you can fool two ... but you cannot fool all. Also what's the deal with the French scientists & philosophers. Obviously NNT suffers from a bias towardsthe French names. But I guess NNT you have gone a bit overboard this time. Also I just could not figure out why NNT wanted to bash Gauss ... NNT seems to have forgotten the 80/20 rule himself. Gaussian addresses the 80% of the problem space. I just could not figure out why anyone in his right mind would like to propose the Mandelbrotion math. It is like saying that if Decimal system does not work then lets use Roman numerals. That is plain stupid! NNT ... please also stop touting the \\"Trader, Practitioner and thus Randomness Expert\\" credentials. Birds can fly does not mean they are Aerodynamics Experts.     Bottomline ... It is just a \\"Fooled by Randomness - part deux\\". However, if you haven't read Fooled by Randomness, then you are better of reading it rather than reading this one.    -Sachin

B000TJBNFI|5.0|Not a film I consider a horror movie, more a psychological thriller, `Misery' has got to be one of the most effective psychological thrillers to date.  This is thanks in large part to the dynamic Oscar winning (and deserving) performance by the legendary Kathy Bates.  In fact, this performance is so dynamic, so convincing that when I first saw this film I was scared sleepless for months it felt (I was merely ten when I saw this movie the first time).  It had such an impact on me that it wasn't until about a year ago that I even considered watching this movie again, and I am so glad that I did.  Now that I am older I can appreciate this film much more, and while it still manages to deliver chills to my spine I'm not hiding my face in the pillow either.  Since I've allowed the film back into my life I've already watched it a handful of times and was just delighted to see it get the royal treatment (DVD wise).<br /><br />The film follows author Paul Sheldon as he finishes yet another novel, this time a departure from his successful `Misery' series.  As he sets off for home (tradition causes him to leave town in order to finish each novel) he's caught in the middle of a snow storm and suffers a terrible wreck.  Worse than the wreck though is what's waiting for him when he opens his eyes.  Annie Wilkes is a nurse who finds Paul on the side of the road and vouches to nurse him back to health.  Annie just so happens to be Paul's biggest fan, eccentric as she is, and so he offers to let her read his novel before anyone else has the opportunity.  This was a grave mistake for Annie is very dissatisfied with his work and holds him hostage forcing him to rewrite it to her satisfaction.  What ensues is a mental game of cat and mouse that is so brilliantly crafted it will have the audience at the edge of their seats.<br /><br />The acting is just brilliant here, Kathy Bates living up to all the hype surrounding her performance.  Annie Wilkes truly is one of the best, if not the best female villain created for the big screen and Kathy Bates' delivery is iconic.  Not to be left out of the equation though is James Caan who meets her every step of the way with a very convincing performance all his own.  Paul Sheldon is the perfect compliment to Annie Wilkes and it's a shame that Caan's portrayal didn't receive the Oscar nomination it deserved.  This is really Bates' movie though, but it's her chemistry with Caan that helps elevate her performance to superiority.  The supporting players are also great, especially that of Richard Farnsworth.  Rob Reiner also deserves some praise for his superb direction here.  He's not a director I'm generally blown away by but here he soars.  He takes Goldman's screenplay (of course adapted from King's masterful novel) and takes off with it.<br /><br />The character of Annie Wilkes is one for the books, a perfect example of the desperation that stems from loneliness and depravation and the pure insanity that it can spawn.  Bates' execution is flawless and continues to add layers to this complex character.<br /><br />`Misery' is one of those rare gems that gets better with time, and this new collectors addition is one of the ways in which it's allowed to shine more brightly.  The new features and inclusions make this disc one for each and every DVD collection.

The lead singer has a gorgeous voice that can handle a wide range of challenges, and the melodies will stay in your head long after you've put the CD away.  Beautiful and sad, this music will remind you of Travis in particular.  I wish more American Idol contestants would choose some Keane songs to sing.

B0006399FS|5.0|Too many people here are complaining that this album isn't enough like The Joshua Tree or other earlier U2 works.  Well, guess what:  The band has been around since 1976 and you can't reasonably expect them to sound the same as they did back in the 80s.  They have changed, grown, and experimented a lot over the years.  If you just give this album a chance and listen to it several times, you'll realize how gorgeous \\"City...\\" is, how inspiring it is to hear \\"All because of you,\\" how ominous \\"Love and peace...\\" actually is, what a crowd-pleaser \\"Vertigo\\" is, and what a lovely tribute there is in \\"Original...\\"

1401300529|4.0|I agree with those reviewers who are critical of Halberstam for not being more thorough for the war in the years 1952-53.  The war dragged on in spite of the prolonged peace talks, in hope that better positions might be gained.  This oversight almost seems a disservice to those he interviewed and the rest who fought and died.  But the author's main thesis actually appears around page 214 when he writes that it was always more than just about Korea.  This is a passage many would read as just another statement, but consider how the book is constructed.  Throughout the first half of the book, it seems that most chapters and pages are dedicated to events either stateside while the war was in progress, or to people and events well prior to the actual fighting in Korea.  For this reason, the author's apparent \\"glossing over\\" of the post-1951 events may seem to reflect a lack of concern, but by the end of the book the account has indeed drifted back to the US political arena and those common soldiers were by and large ignored by the American populace and the American media.     For this reason Halberstam's work is very thorough on the events and people who led the nation up to the Korean War.  I believe he is fair in his assessments of all persons involved.  He is overly critical of Douglas MacArthur, who would not be happy until the country was at total war with Red China.  The China Lobby is likewise criticized as living in a fantasy world where the old colonial ideals would return.  Such thinking gives no credit to the rise of nationalism, and is consequently totally unrealistic.  Whoever believes China remains a \\"Communist\\" nation does not understand political-economic reality.  One could say that outside of Mao's own unrealistic fantasy world, China never has embraced communism in any form Marx would ever agree with or even recognize.    All of this made the first portion of Coldest Winter an absolute treat to read.  What Halberstam needed to do was draft another 200-350 pages and complete the war years as he did the years building up to it.  He could have assessed Eisenhower's administration and the role key Rebuplicans played in the immediate post war years.  He could have set up the Vietnam war, which would have brought his first book on that war to full circle.    It is so unfortunate that Mr. Halberstam was killed in a traffic accident.  The world needs more authors like him, who are not afraid of using modern writing styles that make the common man be the real hero of war and not the nincompoops who start them.
B00007GZR5|5.0|What dreams may come is a trill, tear, and just all around emotion jerker. Its beauty is what the dream is really made of. For Robert Willaims is a artist, and father who life which is full of happiness is showen in his paintings.  But when his kids are taken away and he is also taken away from the enjoyment of life. this is the movie that shows how family and is the most important thing and how someone is willing to go to the limates to save who they love.  This moive makes you think about what may come when life is over for everyone you love.
B00005QDW5|5.0|They did a great job with this album which appears to blend seamlessly from song to song. No mean feat considering Pink Floyd's going through the Barret, Waters, Gilmour eras. There's the usual hits plus a few gems that one would have to buy the entire album just to get the one song.     Just a note, I'm glad they included \\"When the Tigers broke free\\" which was only available on the video or film and not included in the Wall soundtrack.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I am by no means a fan of Pearl Jam, never was and never will be but when I heard Eddie Vedder's work in the tragic tale of Christopher McCandless in the film INTO THE WILD, I just fell in love with the music. Eddie's solo work is a far cry from his work with Pearl Jam. The sparse acoustic melodies captured the essence of Christopher's journey across the US and his adventures in Alaska. The banjo is easily one of my least favorite instruments but the use of the instrument on this album is nothing short of greatness. My personal favorite song on the album is the haunting ballad \\"Nights Long\\" which sends chills down my spine whenever I listen to the song. For the first time ever, Eddie's vocals really moved me. There is an unspoken sadness to his voice that makes the song as well as the movie all the more poignant. My other personal favorite track is \\"Hard Sun\\" which features Corin Tucker from Sleater-Kinney. I can't imagine hearing this song without Corin's vocals. Her vocals and Eddie's are an odd combination but it works nevertheless. I find myself listening to INTO THE WILD over and over again. I keep thinking of the story of Christopher J. McCandless. Eddie Vedder did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of McCandless's story and translating it to music. My only problem with the cd is that it is very short but otherwise a wonderful soundtrack. I loved all of the songs.
B0001XALTG|5.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it. Funnier too. The humor is so outrageous and provides an amazing contrast to the brutal subject of the film, heroin addiction. The movie is hillarious and heavy, but at no point polarizing. It tells the truth. The fundemental flaw in movies today is their too one sided, too good guy bad guy. Well, these guys are by no means good, and by all means flawed, you still find yourself attached to them in a perverted and strange kind of way. The best part of the movie, the ending, sums up the whole moral of the story. Take the money and run.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I was able to find only one fault with Paramore's debut release: I think some of the tracks should be in a different order. Beyond that, these guys (and girl) have a killer record. It's been less and less frequent these days that I receive a new album and can't stop playing it. This is one of those, though! Instrumentally, the band shows many similarities to The Get Up Kids or Brand New, but with a more aggressive tone. The songs structures and arrangements are sophisticated, intelligent, and interesting. There's a nice blend of energy and sing-along melody. It's a much more developed album than one might expect from any band as a debut, but Paramore are particularly surprising considering the youth of the musicians. What really sets this band apart from the others, though, is the vocalist. Hayley Williams, is extremely talented. Her voice is very mature and she knows how to use it well. It's hard to pin down what her influences might be, but at various points I hear shades of Kay Hanley, Tanya Donnelly, or Sandra Nasic (Guano Apes), but her sound is her own. It's nice to hear a female vocalist these days (particularly one so young) that is doing her own thing and not trying to be Gwen Stefani, Courtney Love, or Amy Lee. Although this band would likely get a positive review even with someone else out front, Williams' vocals put this band ahead of the rather large pack of male dominated bands in this genre.

This to me is another one of thoes I told you so kind of movies. I recommend if you like action movies you should watch this movie. It is also a movie if you like technigality.

1592332803|5.0|I can't stress enough how much I love this cookbook!  This is the first cookbook I have actually read.  I love the introduction and I love the fact that it has pictures so I can see the finished result. This cookbook has tons of information from the history of certain desserts, how to replace chicken's eggs, butter, etc. and why we should replace them. I love the fact that it encompasses all baking not just desserts, and what an index!  I've never seen anything like it before.
B00003CXBH|4.0|This is certainly a fine piece of movie-making...but it is not a feel-good movie. Beautiful, tragic, harrowing would be more the words. If you just read a brief description that it's about the troubles of Jesuit missionaries in South America in the 18th century, you will NOT get the idea!     First off, it may not sound very dramatic: well, that gets sorted out pretty quick at the beginning, with the launch of the crucified man to his death down the turbulent river and over the huge thundering waterfall, and then the intrepid priest struggling up sheer water-soaked rocks above a drop of hundreds of feet...And his first encounter with the painted and arrow-bearing tribe - wonderful.     But as the movie progresses, and the Jesuits build their jungle mission, and the unspeakable Don Cabeza reminds us how truly horrible colonial expansion could be, we are plunged into a maelstrom of good and evil. It's the world as we would love it to be and occasionally glimpse it, based on love and integrity, versus the world as it is...or, as the Cardinal says at the end, how we have made it. Greed and power versus simple naked humanity.. guess who wins.    Although the Jesuits are presented as the \\"good guys\\" here, there is a point where the Cardinal (I think it's him) acknowledges that the Indians would have been happier and better off if the sea and winds had not brought ANY of the white race to their shores - which is pretty much true of North America as well.     As I say, a beautiful but not cheering movie. The director's commentary is worth hearing - he actually sought out one of the few hardly-contacted tribes and involved them in this movie. Was that a good thing? who knows. An intriguing sidelight is his mention that they took some members of the tribe to London and New York.  After a while the tribe said they wanted to go home. In our cities, they respected our skill with stone, but there was far too much of it: they liked their own skills with the living world, the plants and animals. Our world was oppressive.
0590032496|5.0|At last someone has written a factual account of the vile, despicable, scheming harridans known as witches. Having been exposed to the Wiccan religion from an early age I know it all to be true! If this book can keep one dear child from turning to this pagan religion, it has served a grand purpose.   P.S.- Check out all the one star reviews by the pagans. Quite entertaining.
B000U7169M|3.0|THE REAPING is one of those disposable religious-based thrillers with the prestige of having a two-time Oscar winner in the leading role.  Hilary Swank plays a professor who makes a career out of refuting so-called miracles by providing scientific support for any odd occurrences.  We learn why she lost her faith and why she wants to debunk God's involvement.  A science teacher from Haven, Louisiana approaches Swank when it appears that the ten plagues from Biblical lore may be occurring there and brought on by a strange little girl.<br />Th3 effects are decent, but the movie never really achieves horrific proportions and the involvement of a Satanic cult seems a little farout.  But it's an okay diversion.
B00082IJ08|4.0|You know, not even a year ago I wouldn't have considered buying this album. The term \\"alternative rap\\" gets applied to it a lot, and the \\"rap\\" part would've scared me off. But hey, my brother got really into the group because of \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\", bought the whole album, and played it for me. I was hooked. This isn't rap - it's far too melodic to be so, and the arrangements are way too elaborate. It's more of a funk-rock thing, with emphasis on the funk. There are some raps, though, but most of those are brilliant (again, see the ridiculously catchy, three-part \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" - though I've gotta say my favorite part of that is not the rap, but the melodic bridge).<br />All right, so there are a couple minor problems I have with this. I don't even like \\"White Light\\" (kinda boring), \\"All Alone\\" (VERY boring), or the title track (overblown); some of the rap is a hinderance (\\"November Has Come\\", which is pretty good outside of that - then again, other than Run-DMC and Public Enemy I can't say rap does much for me), some of the synthesizers are too gimmicky (\\"O Green World\\", which does have a pretty good vocal hook); and it's sometimes derivative (the single \\"Kids with Guns\\" has a nice groove, but it's rehashed from \\"Hello, I Love You\\", and that riff sounds much like \\"Louie, Louie\\"). And there's nothing as brilliant as \\"Clint Eastwood\\" here, though that's just because \\"Clint Eastwood\\" is a brilliant song - to me, it's an alternative classic just slightly below \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Karma Police\\" - I'd put it around some of Soundgarden's best. Lofty praise for it, but it's awesome. Then again, so is \\"Dirty Harry\\", which may actually be better than \\"Clint Eastwood\\", I'm not sure. (hey, Clint Eastwood played Dirty Harry! Noticing a connection?) Great riff; eerie children's choir; solid melody; superb beats; excellent lyrics. One of those songs were everything comes together. Needless to say, it's my favorite on the album, beating out several strong candidates; \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\"; the dark environmentalist's rage \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\"; and the imposing but catchy Shaun Rider (of some alternative group I don't know because I really don't know much about alt-rock - I know classic rock, jazz, R&B and funk fairly well , but not alt-rock) duet \\"Dare\\". And the group makes great use of electronics (\\"Every Planet\\"; \\"El Manana\\"; \\"Last Living Souls\\") - \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\", recited by Dennis Hopper, is also quite amusing.<br />I also like the effort Danger Mouse, Damon Albarn (you know, That Guy from Blur, who did that really dumb \\"Song #2\\" thing), and the rest of this project put into fleshing out the identities and personalities of the virtual members 2D (an oft-abused pretty boy vocalist); Murdoc (an evil bassist who tried to kill 2D and is only working with him because he's doing community service); Russel (borderline insane, alcoholic, often demonically possessed drummer); and Noodle (enthusiastic Japanese guitarist) all have... interesting personalities, and long, complicated backstories. I think the real members of Gorillaz had a bit too much fun developing them, perhaps. Gimmick? Certainly. But a cool one.Good, Inc.\\"; the dark environmentalist's rage \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\"; and the imposing but catchy Shaun Rider (of some alternative group I don't know because I really don't know much about alt-rock - I know classic rock, jazz, R&B and funk fairly well , but not alt-rock) duet \\"Dare\\".

1594489505|5.0|I read A Thousand Splendid Suns hoping to gain some insight emotionally about Islamic culture.  The political overtones were hard to miss, but I think they were justified.  After 30 years of war and suffering, why shouldn't Khaled Hosseini want people to understand the plight of Afghani citizens who have lost their homes and way of life (not to mention other refugees around the world)?  The intertwined lives of two Afghan women represented the daily human battle of all war victims.  What struck me the most was the relentless dehumanization of women, which was continual no matter which warlord, political group, or country was in power.    Both Mariam and Laila, wives of an extremely abusive man named Rasheed, began their lives full of hope, anticipation, and expectations, all of which was systematically stolen from them throughout the course of their lives.  Mariam expected to be loved and instead was rejected and beaten.  Laila expected to have freedom of choice and instead was tricked into an arranged and violent marriage.  However, the spirit of both of these women never died, and they never stopped trying to live meaningful lives.    The first quarter of the book focused on Mariam, the second quarter focused on Laila, and the rest of the book was about their relationship together.  However, I felt that the book empasized the life of Laila, and I kept wondering what happened to Mariam.  After that first quarter, Mariam lost her depth of character.    Despite my slight disappointment with the character development, A Thousand Splendid Suns is absolutely an important book because it is one of the few that invites the reader to emotionally connect with characters from a poorly understood culture.
0399224459|5.0|Our 25-month-old loves this book and wants it read to her roughly 2 or 3 nights out of the week, EVERY week. And, of course, we have to read it to her 3 or 4 times in a row. (You can't really \\"read\\" this book, of course, it has almost no words...you have to describe it.)    Here's something I've been doing for the last few weeks that REALLY adds to the whole experience.    Our daughter has a small stuffed gorilla that bears a faint resemblance to the gorilla in the book. I tied a thread to the gorilla, unreeled about 8 feet of thread, and put the spool in my pocket.    Later on, as my wife was cuddling our girl before bedtime, I came in with the gorilla and told it to sleep well and have a good night. I put the gorilla on the floor and walked away and out the door. As soon as I'd gotten 8 feet away, the gorilla starts \\"following\\" me. I generally bring it back two or three times and go through this again.    The first time I did this, our daughter laughed so hard she got the hiccups. Even now that I've done it many times, she still laughs tremendously hard every time the gorilla follows me. (And because the lighting is low in her room, she doesn't see the thread.)
B000VT55G4|3.0|Looking at other reviews, tastes clearly differ. The movie had some awkward parts and it's hard to see Cusack as a dad, teacher, and coach, but the movie was fun to watch. Not the best movie in the world, but worth the time.
B000WSL5Y0|4.0|Ben Affleck capably directs GONE BABY GONE, a morality tale with no easy answers, with younger brother Casey in the lead role.<br /><br />Casey appears as Bostonian Patrick Kenzie that teams with his significant other, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), to form a private investigative duo. After young Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) is abducted from her bedroom, the pair is hired by family members to augment the local police effort headed by Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and his two detectives, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). As Kenzie and Gennaro navigate the murky undercurrents of the case, they discover that all is not what it seems.<br /><br />Affleck's character is engaging but inscrutable; Monaghan's is vulnerable and attractive but superfluous. Freeman's Doyle is, well, Freeman. (Does he ever turn in less than a stellar performance?) Harris's Bressant, as a veteran member of the child protection squad, exhibits the hard-eyed fanaticism of a True Believer similar to that of the actor's FBI agent role in 1993's [[ASIN:0792164962 The Firm]]. The best performance is undoubtedly that of Amy Ryan as Helene McCready, Amanda's foul-mouthed, drug-running mother in need of an attitude adjustment and whom the audience yearns to slap silly.<br /><br />GONE BABY GONE is elevated to above standard fare by the moral choice presented to Kenzie when he ultimately discovers Amanda's abductor. There's no option between Black and White here, only Black and two diametrically opposed shades of Gray. The choice that can't be avoided and must be made imperils Angie's and Patrick's relationship and may cause spirited discussion among viewers after they exit the film. And, as Kenzie realizes by the ending credits, one's conscience will forever be plagued by doubts.<br /><br />My only criticism of this otherwise engrossing film is the lack of background about the Kenzie character. While appearing boyish and usually almost shy, he periodically exhibits the hard-boiled edge of one comfortable with extreme violence and the willingness to dish it out. How and when did he acquire that? Perhaps a prequel is in order.rtable with extreme violence and the willingness to dish it out. How and when did he acquire that? Perhaps a prequel is in order.

There is a lot of stuff on how to pitch your project to venture capitalists -- including what font sizes to use :-) I can't really judge the value of most of this (yet), but I'd still recommend this book to anyone who is considering doing a start-up (before going into more detailed books).

A few cuts use some electronic instruments that I didn't care for.  One song has relatively uninspired lyrics, that almost sound like normal, everyday bitching about the things that bug us in life.  Bottom line, though, she is still one of the greatest singer/songwriters of all time!  I'm glad shc came back with this CD.

0553801503|5.0|A Feast for Crows is a solid, top-notch fantasy novel. Was it a let down from the three previous novels? Of course; in my opinion A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords are three of the finest novels of epic fantasy ever written. Just because A Feast for Crows may not be as \\"great\\" as the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire does not mean that it is a mediocre book. The truth is A Feast for Crows was a New York Times #1 Bestseller, and was nominated for many fantasy awards including a Hugo. The major problem most people seem to have with the novel is that only half the characters are in it, and the more popular characers Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion are not present. Although I would have been happier with those characters included as well, the novel itself was still very strong and very good. I can say with confidence that all fans of epic fantasy will enjoy this book.
0345298349|5.0|I read \\"Stalin's Ghost\\" as my first Renko novel, and decided to go back to the headwaters with \\"Gorky Park\\", not having any knowledge of the movie, either. It is clear why GP launched a series that lives today, from one side of the breakup of the Soviet Union to the other. The contrast between the two novels when read close together is substantial, given how different Russia is today from the Soviet era. However, in many other ways, it's the same old scene, ripe for observations light and dark about Russians, corruption, politics, vodka and the dreary nature of everyday life.     With all the years in between, the Renko of the latter novel remains true to the Renko who debuted in Gorky Park. He is intelligent and a shrewd investigator underestimated by his enemies and rivals, he loves Russia while cynical about its flaws, he eschews the political games, he is persistent and dedicated to his craft while surrounded by corruption and slackers, and he appreciates attractive, mysterious women. He sounds like my kind of guy. I agree with another reviewer that Renko compares well with Harry Bosch of Michael Connelly's collection.      The story itself has an excellent plot. The bad guys are not that hard to decipher, yet Smith keeps everything moving and sufficiently obscure. The  identification of the dead threesome seemed rather easy, as did the quickness with which Renko hooked up with the young Irina. Osborne and some other supporting characters are finely drawn, and Smith also captures some essence of NY City for the eyes of a new foreign visitor.    One advantage of the age of the novel and its setting: Renko succeeds more-or-less the old fashioned way. This is not CSI with fancy technology doing the work. Renko's brain was the main device. I must say, though, that the dwarf's reconstruction of the deceased's head did have a bit of 21st-century CSI touch about it.    4.5 stars, rounded up
B000063UR2|4.0|Ok, so, bad first: Tom Cruise, the director's cut vs. the US theatrical version make one feel a little like Goldilocks searching for \\"just right\\" (and as soon as I get a DVD drive, I am tempted to create just that, sans angry bears) and not enough of Tim Curry and Mia Sara for my personal taste.<br /><br />I have read reviews where they b*tch about the story line, the dialog and so on, but it's really a movie which is just for visually stunning fun. I watch this film and my mind starts to create all sorts of wonderful graphic novels branching off from different points in the plot (and there is one, which I feel gains, not loses, charm from it's less than tightly woven tapestry of campy goodness). After watching the extras, I realized they just a) didn't decide on a coherent vision beforehand and b) didn't have the budget needed to pull off the one they made up as they went along. It was a bit too impulsive, I suppose, but therein lies the appeal to one's imagination. This film was one of several which influenced my childhood in wonderful ways, and I still enjoy watching it today. As a discerning adult, I see the humor in scenes such as Darkness' booming maniacal laughter [when Lily calls him an animal] which continues just a shade too long after the cut to voyeurs Jack and Gump.<br /><br />I would have left in the longer scene with Meg Mucklebones, which I thought was fairy tale excellence; also would have kept the extra lines from the director's cut between Darkness and Lily - but thank goodness they sliced out Tom Cruise's extra dialog because the US theatrical version has just about all the \\"acting\\" from him I can stand. Good grief. I go to a special place [during Tom Cruise's scenes as Jack] where Johnny Depp steps in and kicks *ss. I can't be the only one...<br /><br />The film is gorgeous at times and grotesque at others, but always rich. I like the elves and fairies as imperfect, mischeivous creatures. Lily's dance captures me now as it did when I was 7 years old(yes, I prefer *Dark Lily*), as does the scene where she touches the unicorn. I cannot say enough about Tim Curry's performance as Darkness (shivers - the good kind). The emotion that man conveyed beneath huge contacts and pounds of make-up is just astounding; his entire performance is ... salacious, lascivious, luscious and delightful.<br /><br />Any fans of Big D should watch the Director's Cut just for the oddly fascinating \\"chair scene\\" between Darkness and Lily. It really explains why exactly it was so important to him for bratty Lily to \\"SIT!\\" - and the *real* reason for his temper tantrum. I had to pause and watch it frame by frame to absorb all the details in the funky throne ... what's with the suspicious-looking oozing fluids, people?<br /><br />I think that's long enough...I would recommend this film to anyone looking for an entertaining oh-my-Goth suspension of disbelief. :D<br /><br />Best Wishes to all!k Lily*), as does the scene where she touches the unicorn.

0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein, in this work, on the subject \\"Disaster Capitalism,\\" is simply trying to remind us that no society can survive if people cannot acquire the basic means of life--which we understand to be food, clothing and shelter.      Klein is drawing our attention to global exploitation in its current stage of crisis. Transnational corporations and neo-liberal economic policies imposed upon the world of nations, by a few, are pushing the majority of the world's population to the precipice of disaster--Depriving the majority in society of the most fundamental means of survival.    Klein's task is very hard. It is challenging.  In her idea of \\"Disaster Capitalism,\\" in my opinion, Klein is not only running against Newton's natural law of gravity, which has been distorted to fit the logic of capital and opportunism; the intellectual booster of the system, Milton Friedman, and his large cabal also fiercely confronts her.    Regarding natural laws:Trickle down? When Sir Isaac Newton discovered the law of gravitation as a natural phenomenon by which all objects with mass attract each other, Newton failed to add a disclaimer that the law did not apply to the relationship between global wealth and the world's masses--under the growing crisis-filled system of world capitalism.     Under the system of \\"Disaster Capitalism,\\" wealth moves in the opposite direction of the world's poor--up into a few large hands, deep pockets and sprawling bursaries of the world's small class of rich elites, away from the people.     \\"Disaster Capitalism,\\" Klein's subject, is transferring,without pause, massive wealth from below (i.e. from the the working poor and worker-nations) up to the world's rich, small propertied class. The process, in its cruel movement, intensified its wrong doings from as early as the 17th C. Today we are seeing the outcome,the ever-bulging ranks of global propertyless-poor, getting poorer. THey cannot retain the fruits of their hard earned domestic production as some nations now owe over a 150% of annual GDP to International financers. In such nations, infant mortality rate is reaching over 70 or 80/1000; unemployment is 30%-40% of the workforce and life expectancy is below 65 years or worse.    How they got into this problem is the subject of another long debate.    Naomi Klein recently wrote (in the guardian-co-uk, 10/25/07) that: \\"Many publications have seen fit to assign business journalists to review the book. And why not? They are the experts. Unabashed fans of the late free-market evangeliser Milton Friedman, these are our primary purveyors of the idea that ballooning corporate profits are on the verge of trickling down to the citizens of the world in the form of freedom and democracy.\\"    We should all study this book and draw our own conclusions.    Klein's cause is global, moral and just.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Like Kevin Smith, the first time I saw this film I was stupefied. \\"What?!\\" Repeated viewings disabused me of the notion that there was nothing in this film to understand. I now think this is a work of absolute genius<br /><br />Originally written and filmed as a TV pilot, the ending was only written after the show was rejected. Knowing the history of the genesis of the film only increased my appreciation for its craft, because the ending qualitatively transforms the entire first three quarters of the film. I cannot comprehend how Lynch was able to think of an ending that turned the whole first part of the film on its head, making it meaningful on a completely different, and more subtle layer.<br /><br />For first time viewers, I can only say that it's important to pay attention to the whole film. Every shot. Colours, symbols, recurring objects and motifs, all play a part in revealing the film's secrets. I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

B000NAAEUI|5.0|There are many different versions of this album available - each with it's own different bonus track or tracks. So if you've bought this album and you only got the \\"core\\" 11 songs, you're missing out! *I'll talk about this more at the end.*<br /><br />No Sophomore Jinx here - a great follow up to the break through 'Silent Alarm'! All the songs are cohesive and fit the idea of an album having a running theme perfectly. But don't think each song can't stand on its own, because they do - very well!<br />One thing the songs here have incommon structurally is that they like to build to a climax, usually swelling and swirling to a driving energetic release.<br /><br />This album builds on the guys solid foundation of great song writing with great hooks, powerful and precise instrumentation, passionate vocals, and infectious and dancable drum beats. Here, they add cohesive themes, 3 dimensional layers and spacious depth to an already great sound.<br /><br />The two bonus tracks here are 'The Once and Future King' & 'Secrets'.<br />The Once and Future King is a really catchy, up-beat song with an awesome guitar riff hook. Secrets is a driving and haunting gem.<br /><br />*I've heard this referred to as the \\"Target Exclusive\\" version, because these two perticular bonus tracks were packaged with the album for Target stores exclusively(and here at Amazon apparently).<br /><br />Personally, I've got three copies of this album and each one has two exclusive bonus tracks. Each version can be found here at Amazon, I've checked.'We Were Lovers' & 'England' on the Japanese Import version. 'Emma Kate's Accident' & 'Version 2.0' on the Best Buy version. And finally 'The Once & Future King' & 'Secrets' on the Target version.<br />All 6 of these bonus tracks are just as good as anything on the album itself, and obviously fit the theme and sound of it as well.<br /><br />Bloc Party is steadily becoming one of my favorite bands because of their prolific and quality out-put of  great music.

0446577391|5.0|Even though I do a lot of reading, fiction isn't really my thing. In fact, I usually only read a few works of fiction each year. So, when my daughter brought home an advance reading copy of STONE COLD by David Baldacci from the bookstore where she works, I didn't get too excited about it. She told me she had read one of his books before and thought it would be something I might like. The book sat idle on the desk in my library for a couple of weeks. Then one morning, before going to the office, I had a few extra minutes and decided to take a look at it.<br /><br />If I lacked excitement about the book before, that lack of excitement was multiplied after reading the excruciating first sentence. It was a painful fifty-two words long and contained six commas. I looked at my watch then glanced again at the cover. \\"Okay Mr. Baldacci, you've got exactly twelve minutes to grab my attention.\\"<br /><br />Well, guess what. Mr. Baldacci did indeed grab my attention. The first sentence turned out a poor example of Baldacci's writing style. Over the next day and half, every spare minute was spent flipping the pages of this book. Even though this is apparently the third or forth book in a series, the character development was spectacular. The story is non-stop and will have you dying to know what happens next.<br /><br />I hate it when reviewers give away too much storyline, so I'll limit what I tell you about the plot. Most books of this nature, I find, too much of a stretch to be believable. I only found minor instances of that here. Here's an example; as I said, Baldacci brilliantly constructs his characters. Here we have a ruthless casino owner, feared by all, known to be a dangerous man you never want to cross. Yet he employs a barmaid at the casino who is quite loose-lipped about her employer's dealings. Not likely. The reader is also asked to buy into assassinations of high ranking cold-war officials. But don't let these little trivialities stop you from enjoying a book that is non-stop action.  These mistakes are few and far between and are easily overlooked. This is a book you will not want to put down.<br /><br />Baldacci is a champion at creating the scene on that big screen TV in your mind. In fact, this book has all the makings of a blockbuster movie. You'll see what I mean as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, some pedantic, self-absorbed producer will get their hands on it and ruin a perfectly good story.<br /><br />I'm still not a big fiction reader. I just don't have time. But as someone who reads only a handful of fiction books each year, I'm glad this book was one of them.These mistakes are few and far between and are easily overlooked.

B000OV170W|4.0|I am usually a suspense/mystery novel reader, but decided to take a chance on reading a Jodi Picoult novel after high recommendations from friends.  I really enjoyed reading this book for the most part. The plot and character development were great.  I felt a connection with each of the characters.  I could hardly put the book down.  I was in great anticipation as to how this would end and, unfortunately, was ultimately disappointed in this regard.  I cried, of course, but I felt like the author took the easy way out.  When I think of alternative ways this could have ended, I see there would have been room for criticism either way, so maybe there weren't any good options.  But, I guess I just hoped the ending would add something more than it did.  I'm going to try one more of her books, but if the ending is this disappointing again, I may be done with this author.
B000UCEJEQ|2.0|I love me some Annie like no tomorrow- and REALLY tried to get into this album!  After so long, I just found it difficult to digest.      The only memorable tracks on her are 'Love is Blind', 'Ghosts in my Machine, and 'Coloured Bedspread'.  The rest just seem to get lost in oblivion, and 'Sing' is just plain bad (though the intentions behind it were genuine and creditworthy.)    Put it this way. After listening to a couple of tracks, I would find myself returning to the Bare album, which blows me away each time I listen.  There's nothing like her tracks 'Hurting Time' and 'Honestly' to really bring me back to full circle with Annie.     Disappointing. Not catchy enough.  Not 'bare' enough. But still love Annie regardless.
0671004107|4.0|I picked up this book and was fascinated just from reading the first few paragraphs. I disagree that Ellie was not a strong character, nor did I find any other characters to be lacking. I really liked Ellie as a character, and really disliked some others!    I admire any book from a female viewpoint written by a man, because the generic character is usually male and I think males think from a female viewpoint much less than women think from a male viewpoint. In the early chapters he describes her frustrations about sexism very well and has some pretty specific observations about it that make me think he went to a lot of effort to understand women. And if someone as brilliant as him could see how silly and unfounded sexism is, it's about time some other people do too.     This book goes all over the place. Lots of different types of characters, lots of beliefs, lots of debates and conversations. Carl Sagan is a great writer and there are certain descriptive paragraphs that I still remember and just think \\"wow\\". One main theme of this book is the ongoing science vs religion battle. I think he is kind of saying that science doesn't exclude spirituality- in a way it makes spirituality much larger than what we can imagine.      My main criticism of this book was that the scientific and mathematical babble was difficult to comprehend. I basically had to just use my imagination for large sections of it. I wish I could understand more (although if there is anyone who has helped this clueless person understand science, it is Carl) but possibly some people (with degrees in science!) didn't have this problem and maybe liked these sections.    Even though I didn't understand all of what he was talking about, I still wanted to read on! This book wasn't what I would call high-suspense in every chapter, but there were so many possibilities to what could occur and I really wanted to find out what would happen next. Some science fiction books just use characters as props, without getting too involved in their motivations and personal lives, but I think this book had a lot of emotional appeal, and this was a nice balance to all the techno talk. There are also some surprises, especially one in the ending. I think when he wrote this book, he put his heart right into it.
B000002L9J|5.0|Not only is the \\"Queen Is Dead\\" the best album done by the Smiths/Morrissey, it's one of the finest indie albums of all time. It's one of those few albums that has a perfect collection of songs wonderfully sewn together.  It starts off with outrageous power in the song, 'The Queen Is Dead', but after almost 7 minutes of blinding intensity, it falls right into the comedic 'Frankly, Mr. Shankly,' which both insights and entertains with a delicious wit and its sweet riff.  The next two songs, 'I Know It's Over' and 'Never Had No One Ever', wallow into an unreached level of Moz depression; lyrics so powerful and true, they can easily make you cry.  At this point, the rollercoaster ride that is \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" enters the middle of it's potent line-up, delivering three classics from the Smiths endless volume, 'Cemetry Gates', another display of Morrissey's poetic prowess; the deeply strong, and hilarious, 'Bigmouth Strike Again', and the gorgeously soft and sweet plea of 'The Boy With the Thorn in His Side'. At this moment, one can see that the Smiths have hit new heights of lyrical wizardry and riff making.  The next track is the wonderful `Vicar in a Tutu', the side-splitting wag setting itself up for the immortal `There Is a Light That Never Goes Out'. This song is an anthem of alternative/indie music. It's the soundtrack to every boy who couldn't tell his best friend he loved him. To every kid who just wanted to have someone to drive around with. To anyone who couldn't express themselves with their own words, Morrissey and Marr delivered. It's a song for me, it's a song for you, it's a song for us all.  By now you might find yourself laying back in the passenger seat with either tears or just an incredible smile of thanks to the Smiths.  The final track, `Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others', opens, and then cleverly closes, and then reopens, displaying perfect, soft Moz lyrics and brilliant Johnny Marr handiwork. And there the album closes. No `Golden Lights'; no `Meat Is Murder'; no awkward beginnings that are custom in their self-titled debut and \\"Hatful of Hollow\\"; no, thank goodness, `Hand In Glove'. Just one of the finest albums you'll ever have the pleasure of hearing!
B000002540|5.0|BOC used to tour in the late 70's early 80's each summer with Black Sabbath, on the double bill \\"Black and Blue Tour\\".  I saw them together several times, including the infamous downpour rainout at Phoenix Stadium with Molly Hatchet and Shakin' Street (look it up).  This album captures that energy like no other.  Buck Dharma's Gibson through a few Marshall stacks.  The sound is raw, tight, and aggresive.  No digital effects,  no overdubs, no jive studio harmonies, just the concert.  \\"Cities On Flame\\" should be a workshop lesson for any young band that wants to understand syncopation, playing tight, letting the song breath with some space, and then bringing the hammer down.  Study it.
0525950079|3.0|I was very excited about reading this sequel.  The Pillars of the Earth was a book that had an intricate plot, great characters, and a real sense of the times.  The World Without End is not a bad book, it is just an average book.  The endless plotting by the Prior becomes boring after a while.  The gratuitous sex in the plague years does not add anything to the book.  I liked the characters, that was the strong point of the book.  However, while I will read Pillars of the Earth again, and Edward Rutherford's Sarum again, I do not forsee this book as a keeper in my library.

0596009208|5.0|Best way to put yourself to bed is read a boring technical textbook. This book is not one of those! I actually have some great Java reference books but none of them explain java concepts in such a concrete and tangible and entertaining way. Never  have I ever had a book that made me laugh so hard while learning Java. I love this book, it helps to really drive home java concepts in a way that's easy to understand and it makes you laugh.
0920668372|5.0|I introduced this book to both my daughter and my mother.  One year when my mom had all her daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren home for Christmas, she read the book aloud to everyone.  There wasn't a dry eye in the house.  My teenage daughter still loves this book and keeps it on her bookshelf hoping to share it with her own children someday.
032147404X|5.0|I read this whole book on a flight from NY, to Puerto Rico, very informative and easy to understand for people getting ready to delve into the world of digital slr cameras.  Great tips and easy to follow steps to get great pictures in no time... I have yet to purchase a DSLR camera but i'm pretty confident in knowing that I can learn to take excellent pictures fast with this book at hand. I even picked up some great tips for using compact pocket style cameras.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Having worked in a record store, Linkin Park was like nails on a chalkboard for everyone there.  The kids liked them, but every employee there thought they sucked royally.  Cut to seeing Transformers this Summer, and the closing credits played over \\"What I've Done\\" finally brought me in to check them out.  Bringing producer Rick Rubin in was the best move the band could have made.  Gone are the lame white-boy raps, and fake techno beats, instead concentrating on a more definitive rock approach, which at this point in their career has redefined their sound, instead of stagnating like Limp Bizkit or Korn have done.  Although I don't think this will sell as well as their old albums, it is their best IMO.
0061547832|5.0|I've always thought of myself as being internally motivated and someone who would walk right past this book in the store. Thanks to a friend who dropped this read on my desk, I have a new rejuvenated sense of what I can do mentally and professionally to take myself to the next level. Will it make me as rich as Trump? Highly unlikely, but it did infuse a new sense of motivation and provided a number of great reminders for when visit clients.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I purchased Planet Earth to use as an accessory tool for my freshman world geography classes.  I've had requests to lend it to other classes.  The photography is incredible, and the information provided has obviously been well researched.  Whether for home or school use, I recommend this series.  Am also about to order Blue Planet as another great tool.  Quality programs are hard to find, but the BBC always has good ones (I guess because I'm British, I could be biased, but not in this case!!)

0805079831|5.0|Little has been written in the past 25 years that provided such a thorough critique of free market failures as this particular book. Chronicling the first experiments in South America in the 70s and following it through Russia, Poland, China and--ultimately--Iraq, Klein provides a thorough examination of how free-market policies were created in the wake of disaster, and how those policies influenced the people of each particular country. She likens the experiments to shock therapy, and although she isn't always clear on the connections, it's easy to see that there are indeed a number of important conclusions that can be drawn from her analysis.<br /><br />I had to let the book sit in my mind for a few days before writing this review. It's an important book because it touches on a lot of information that we don't see often in mainstream press, especially not now when so many free-market think tanks like the Heritage Foundation are regularly promoting their views on national television, billed as \\"experts\\" and relying on the fact that the public is generally unfamiliar with the failures of free-market systems, reinforcing Milton Friedman's ideals.<br /><br />One of the best critiques of Milton Friedman I ever read came from a scientist who had happened upon his books. Friedman's theories will never work, said the scientist, because Friedman stretches the scientific method in order to prove his hypotheses. In Shock Doctrine, Klein shows exactly how Friedman's policies were unable to present the intended outcome, instead driving up unemployment and destroying the middle class, leaving a few rich and many more poor in country after country after country, continuing all the way to the policies that shaped Iraq and had disastrous consequences.<br /><br />Friedman, Klein says, often argued that he never told Pinochet to kill the thousands of people in Chile during that country's historic economic revolution, the first true free-market experiment (and its first failure). What Friedman never explained was that Pinochet ordered the deaths of over 10,000 people because it was the only way to force the free-market policies onto the people. Pinochet killed in order to instill fear and prevent an uprising against the free-market policies being implemented.<br /><br />\\"Economic freedom equals political freedom,\\" Klein quotes Friedman as saying. And yet, given the history detailed in this book, it seems economic freedom is created only at the expense of political freedom. Where the free market thrives, it is only because political freedom is suppressed.ed was that Pinochet ordered the deaths of over 10,000 people because it was the only way to force the free-market policies onto the people.

B000NMW6M0|2.0|I was encouraged to use this movie with a Freshman Year experience class in the hopes that there would be some lessons from popular culture.  I'm sorry to say that the movie was not helpful.  In the same vein as Borat, I feel like less of a person after watching this film.  There is no redemption.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Though a different sound than their previous album, this cd rocks!!! Go to your nearest Best Buy store to buy this album and recieve two extra songs. A must have for any rock fan!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This album is a non-stop testosterone-heavy off-the-rails-and-laying-more party. Eddie's manic genius blew everyone away when this came out in '77. His tone was at its peak with his original frankenstein guitar through the maxed-out plexi with the cranked variac, melting tubes every few tunes and melting minds every few seconds. His lightning fluidity and endless imagination is pheeeenomenal, and Eruption is still the ne-plus-ultra guitar solo. Ed tends towards the major pentatonic far more than most other shredders, who keep it minor and boringly \\"evil\\". Ed's sunny sound is way more fun and fits well with Roth's goofy lyrics, giving the band and the album a good-time vibe that's made it the soundtrack for many many millions of parties since it came out. These guys loved to imbibe and partake, and there's a real contact high available from some of the peaks on I'm The One and Ice Cream Man, among others.<br /><br />Roth is wisely self-mocking while also playing the male stripper/andgrogynous rock singer to the hilt; Jagger was never this funny. Dave is unique and his refusal to take it all seriously is what makes him a classic, the true clown prince of rock and roll. He was also maybe the swinginest rock showman of them all. Not many hard rock bands made their crowd dance this much; some of us also like to boogie when we headbang. Speaking of which, Dave and Eddie are now back on the road and sounding pretty fine, so some of the old live shows are appearing on traders' torrent sites. Check 'em out, 10/03/07 and 7/3/84 are hot and the 10/15/77 show in hometown Pasadena is especially smokin', from just before they hit big. It's got some of the most insanely wailing guitar work imaginable, taking this record a little bit further.<br /><br />Along with the initial albums by Jimi, Zep and the Doors, this is one of the most astonishing first efforts in rock music.<br />Crank it up, open a few and get on down.
B0002IU988|5.0|This is hands down one of the best albums ever made! A must have for any rock fan!
B00003CXSP|3.0|This sequel is rather pointless and lacks most of what made Lambs great.<br />They spent the cash and got the pros---Scott, Mamet and Hopkins---but the lynchpin of the first movie has been removed and that kills it.<br /><br />Jodie Foster made you care about her; Julianne Moore does not. She's emotionally flat and quite boring, and the movie suffers greatly due to her weak performance as the character Foster made fascinating.<br /><br />Hannibal is also paced far too slowly and even when it's gory, in its faux-elegant way, it's not really scary. There's little suspense and the sudden weirdness of the last 20 minutes offers no payoff. Hopkins is good but without Foster's heart to play off there's not much to make this truly worth watching. Even the cannibal moments are kinda boring.<br /><br />I usually love Scott, but his grand shots are mostly lacking here and Mamet's script is too plodding to keep one entertained.<br /><br />Not even close to the quality of the original; if you really love that you might want to avoid this and Hannibal Rising. They add nothing to the story.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Jay Hernandez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), and Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli) star as three young college students backpacking across Europe.  But their trip is about to take a turn for the worse.    Paxton and Josh are from the United States.  While on their trip in Europe, they met and befriended Oli, who has now become part of the group.  Their mission: to do as many drugs and have sex with as many women as possible.  They have also met another person, who tells them about a town in Slovakia, where the women will do practically anything with a man who has an American accent.  Eager to find out, the three board a train and head for Slovakia.  While on the train, the three meet an extremely odd gentleman, who we will see more of later in the film.    Once they reach their deatination, Paxton, Josh, and Oli check into a Hostel.  Sure enough, the man was right; the guys end up sharing a room with two gorgeous women, and the sex and drugs begin to flow.    However, strange things begin to happen.  Oli suddenly checks out of the hostel without telling Josh or Paxton.  Then, a few days later, Josh does the same thing, only he finds himself in a torture chamber along with the man from the train.  This deranged man is doing unspeakable things to Josh, including slicing his hamstrings.  Meanwhile, Paxton is beginning to become suspicious of the two girls.  The girls tell him that his two friends have been taken to a local art museum.  Angered, Paxton tells the girls he wants to go there as well.  So, the girls oblige, and Paxton is forced into the same cruel situation as Josh and Oli were.  But, unlike his friends, Paxton manages to survive, despite having several fingers cut off.    Paxton is able to discover that the \\"art museum\\" is really some kind of sick place where people can pay money to kill another person.  It costs the most money for someone to have the chance to kill an American; hence, the attraction between the girls and Paxton and Josh.  Will Paxton be able tosurvive to tell his story, or will he be caught in the end?    I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this has to be one of the most bloody and gory I've ever seen.  I've seen all of the \\"Saw\\" series of films, and I think that this movie is even more bloody than those.  The first part of the movie has very little killing, but the second half more than makes up for it.  There are several gross scenes, including the slicing of the hamstrings, the cutting of eyeballs, and the use of a drill and chainsaw.  This is definitely not a movie for the squeamish.    I thought this was an ok movie, but not a great one.  The large amount of blood and gore were just too much to handle.  True fans of bloody movies will probably enjoy this movie more, but be warned; the amount of blood and gore in this movie is tremendous.  Watch at your own risk.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie is a classic just like the story it tells.  I have been watching this movie every Christmas since I was a little girl.  Watching this movie was the first time I heard \\"A Christmas Carol\\".  I love this movie!
B0000041A9|5.0|There is really not much I can add to the reviews below, but I wanted to put in my two cents anyway, if only to increase the count of 5-star reviews for this work. Whenever my wife and I listen to these CDs, we ask ourselves how these sonatas for cello can be so overlooked by supposed Beethoven experts. Definitely among the most underrated pieces by Beethoven. The scherzo from the A Major sonata is something words cannot really describe (and so is the entire sonata). But then I realize it is probably 50% Beethoven + 50% Rostropovich and Richter. We have watched Daniel Barenboim and Jacqueline Du Pre play this same sonata on a tape from the old Granada TV series and, even though they are absolutely great, their performance does not touch this one. I think this is a can't-miss buy for any lover of classical music.
B000QXDED6|3.0|roduct Description<br />The epic graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City) assaults the screen with the blood, thunder and awe of its ferocious visual style faithfully recreated in an intense blend of live-action and CGI animation. Retelling the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, it depicts the titanic clash in which King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartans fought to the death against Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his massive Persian army. Experience history at swordpoint. And moviemaking with a cutting edge.<br /><br />i have to say that this movie was not totally a bad movie i really did enjoy the movie i felt that the story didnt make a lot of sense because i didnt understand what king leonidas point of going to war because he was so into hearing his own yelling voice or just wanted to defend his people. i mean it can be debated but for the most part...the film does have it entertaining moments in the movie i love the gore scenes that really get into the movie. frank miller is very good at creating stories full of blood and gore and violence. i thought that this movie is good but i hope that there are no more sequels to this film just 300 was enough and i think that if they make 400 or 500 then it is going to be stupid so i say buy this film and enjoy the comic book like animation and intense gore scenes even the performance of Gerard Butler is amazing to watch but if u are looking for amazing story u are not going to find it here so wait till the movie gets a little cheaper and then buy on here.
061891868X|3.0|While Dr. Smolin does well to point out the problems with the science community today, in my view he spends too much time on String Theory and too little on the other fields which also suffer from \\"entrenched\\" scientists.  In fairness he does talk about other fields, but primarily about string theory and it gets very tiring to try to follow it, though I hung in there understanding perhaps 10-20%.  My real concern is with his apparent acceptance of another fatally flawed theory - The Big Bang Theory.  BBG has more flaws which have been proven by observation than String Theory, which is little more than a thought problem, since, by its very nature, it is unprovable.  We simple do not have the ability at this point to verify anything on such a small scale.  Just because it makes sense mathematically doesn't mean that it is real in our world.  There is also no point in talking about multiple dimensions when we are incapable of seeing or detecting them.  It is one thing to play with such ideas, but another altogether to claim unprovable ideas as theory or fact.     We absolutely must have these thought games and support all serious efforts to conduct research, because who knows what will come of them.  Things that seemed impossible in the past became quite reasonable once all the facts were known.  I believe that all of the concept of our Universe can be understood on the macro level by any reasonably intelligent person.  However, understanding science on the micro level is much more difficult.  It is one thing to know that water is made up of atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, and other to understand how atoms work at the subatomic level.    I've gotten pretty far afield here.  I think this is a much needed book, just a bit too narrowly focused and \\"micro\\" for me.  We need more such books questioning the status quo of scientific \\"beliefs.\\"
B000000WCA|4.0|So they're a little cheesy. I'll say the same thing I said about Milli Vanilli. Who Cares? They may have little or no singing talent, but the songs (especially \\"Say You'll Be There\\") are catchy as hell, and at least they came around before Britney Spears, who is so much more responsible for ruining teen pop music than they could ever be. That dreamy sex ballad \\"Naked\\" is pretty cool, too.
0156027321|3.0|Perhaps I had high expectations of what this book would deliver after hearing so many rave reviews and seeing the high review rating on Amazon....    Ultimately, I was bored with this book. Nearly 100 pages of reading went by before anything \\"exciting\\" happened. Although this is a book of fiction, I found Pi's story of survival pretty hard to believe. Not to insult his intelligence, but I also thought his methods of survival were pretty advanced for a kid in his early teens. I kept waiting to near the end of the book, thinking some twist in the story was coming and would make my reading efforts worthwhile. Eh. It didn't.    In summary, good, but not great.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album does not disappoint.  A terrific variety of songs and lyrics are still powerful as ever.  Just saw Bruce and the band last night in Oakland and he played 9 out of 11 of these songs, and they sounded great live.  The two songs he didn't play were just as good if not better than the others (\\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" and \\"You'll Be Comin' Down\\").  Don't miss the message of \\"Magic,\\" it's a commentary on the current administration's policies.  I think this album is better than the Rising and is as enjoyable as Born in the USA.  Bruce still has the Magic.
9707704667|1.0|Where are the women who are offended by this book? The Bad Girl (why \\"girl,\\" not \\"woman\\"?)is a very bad girl. In Japan, for example, she gets involved with a Japanese gangster, a sinister character, a \\"boss in the Japanese mafia.\\" And yet, in the long misogynistic tradition of Western and South-American literature, the weak-kneed hero longs for her with all the frail force of his corrupt soul: \\"It was clear, the bad girl's indescribable audacity would never cease to amaze me.\\" Why? From the beginning of the book, the bad \\"Chilean\\" girl is put up for merciless ridicule. This is how the narrator describes her in her hour of distress, after her real identity is revealed. He asks her to dance with him \\"'Mambo No. 5'\\", her specialty, but, lo and behold, \\"Lily couldn't do anything right, she lost the beat, became distracted, made mistakes, stumbled, and her little sailor's hat slipped, making her look fairly ridiculous.\\"  The book, it seems to me thrives on ridicule: at one time it is the woman who is humiliated by the man, and another time it is the same man who is humiliated by the woman. The woman who initiated the party is dubbed \\"the fat little pig,\\" and so on. The source of \\"pleasure\\" in this book is in humiliation: sought, slapped on, and enjoyed. Well, I do not enjoy it. It is not the kind of pleasure that amazes me. It degrades men, women, and art itself. What is most astonishing to me is that the author who wrote, a few years ago, the wonderful article \\"Why Literature\\" in The New Republic would succumb to such cheap temptations, a book that does not build or show the complexities of character but engages in some nefarious dance of skeletons.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Is it a classic like Born to run, no. Is it a Rock and Roll bible like the river, no.    But \\"Magic\\" is a solid rock and roll disc. The Boss and East Street do certain things really well and this is a fine example. About 40% of the disc right off the bat is excellent. You may ask what about the remaining 60%? Well at least with me if you keep the Boss in the rotation and listen the music gets better and grows on you. So in short \\"Magic\\" is a sleeper, it teases you with the big cuts but gets full circle with more listens.
B00000AD94|3.0|So, you get a bunch of guys together with a load of talent and let them do their own thing. The vocals are the ballerinas. The music is the orchestra. If you saw a homeless person dancing on the street, you wouldn't know the coreography going on in his mind. If you closed your eyes and listened to the sounds in Central Park, you wouldn't make sense of the pigeons and the taxis. However, together, for those of us that can appreciate the contemplative expressionist, the two pieces work together to form an expression of angst against a world that moves too fast to contemplate. I keep this as a token of the unformed digression of emotions that I feel from day to day. It is not a hopeful preview of that which can be in each of us. It is the slippery grasp of what we just missed. These guys have done better. So can we.

So, have some wine, get in the kitchen cook pop it on for backround music you'll dig it. My only disappointment is it has some much wasted potential for what it could have been.  So, pedestrian jazz.

The movie was okay but the way Lewis writes makes you imagine scenes that cannot be duplicated with technology.<br /><br />While reading this book you will feel that you are entering a new world. As you come back to the pages again and again, you will develop a fondness for a place that exists only in your mind. As the story draws to a close you may experience a kind of home sickness and feel somewhat silly because it's just a book...right?<br /><br />This is great bedtime reading to children.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|i'm only giving this album 5 stars because of the songs. I think this is some of bruces best material since the tunnel of love.

0743243153|5.0|By the time i came to review this book, there already 160 reviews posted. I don't know if mine will make any difference, but here it is:    I read this book in the early days i was studying to become a therapist, and read it again recently. That first time, it was the best book i've ever read (just did not know i could write comments :) I started my studies trying to understand: myself, the world around me. And how scared i was! That the book starts with the sentence \\"life is difficult\\", gave me a reason to continue reading. Finally, somebody said what i felt all along, but could not verbalize since everyone else around me did not seem to think so. Yes, this life we are living is a difficult one, and nowadays is getting more and more difficult as we strive to make ends meet and make sense of a paranoid world unfolding around so fast to catch, let alone comprehend. And though i've read many books since that time that have given me more answers and understanding to comprehend myself and the world, this book, the Road Less Traveled, was for me the first that got me started on this road to self discovery, world discovery.     So thank you Dr Peck for living, learning, and sharing with us, and setting us on this road that has no return, the crossroads where psychology and spirituality meet - though i have to say i was not too excited with the Christian religion gloss, yet i think i get the point.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Has it been a dark road that has carried Annie Lennox all the way from the new wave pop of the 80s Eurythmics to a stellar solo career?  Well there may have been some somber moments and dark corners but Songs of Mass Destruction (SOMD) in spite of its somewhat depressing and prophetic title, offers a lot of variety, the whole encapsulated in Lennox's beautiful, soaring voice.  Many commentators rightly state that this is the best instrument in the piece.    SOMD opens with the single, Dark Road, which amply demonstrates Annie's range.  It is dark but at the same time rich in tonal quality and provides the listener with an indication of the quality still to come.  If you love Annie's voice, you will love Dark Road and Through the glass darkly.    Next comes Love is Blind a joyous piece of pop that Annie belts out and which also includes a very enjoyable rap.    Then, getting a little deeper into the tangled and powerful emotions that surround a breakup comes the slow burner \\"Smithereens.\\"  At first it seems like a less interesting track but then begins to grow on the listener with repeated listens.  It is now a favourite.     Ghosts in my machine kicks the tempo back up again and has an infectious chorus that the listener wants to sing along to, addresses imperfect humanity, which is a general theme of the album overall and leads to Womankind which flies the feminist banner high, again offers a slice of rap and is something that you will want to or can't help singing along to, whether man or woman!    Through the glass darkly is a soaring ballad that underlines the pain of emotional despair and fully showcases Annie's wonderful voice.  Many have said that the album is worth its price for this track alone.   Lost is also powerfully sung and has become one of my favourites on the disc.  I love the layered vocals and the high notes that Annie reaches.    Sing is OK and is similar to a chant with African accents and an announcement at its start that the song has been created to support a charity trying to prevent Mother-Child transmission of AIDS/HIV, a worthwhile cause to support.  Annie's voice outshines and outpowers the chorus of \\"equals.\\"    Big Sky is a big interesting ballad and Fingernail Moon rounds the set off in a reflective frame of mind having a very relaxing feel to it and adventuresome lyrics.    Annie has done a good job in SOMD and I am looking forward to her next.
0393312836|3.0|Criticising control of rebellious youth.      The novel looks at one young man in particular, leader of a violent gang, and what he does, and what is done to him by a rather fascist government to rein him in.    Also would seem to be about the usual fears of the old people of the powerless in general youth of the time, in whatever time.    Unfortunately, a little dull to go along with that, an comes across as contrived at times.
0316067598|5.0|Wow! This is the most amazing story of American heroism. As I finished I was both moved to tears and extremely proud at the same time. We get twisted, one dimentional stories of the war from the main stream media.

I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.
B00006AW2J|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to upgrade from my original-issue \\"Beggar's\\" CD.  Especially considering this is my all-time favorite Stones album.  If you're a Stones neophyte trying to decide where to start (assuming you want an actual album as opposed to a multi-era 'best of' compilation), I highly recommend this one.  It can be looked at as the beginning of the Stones true classic period, or as the culmination of everything did up to this point (or both).      So I missed out on the SACD hybrid, which is fine because I don't own an SACD player and likely never will.  The normal CD layer on this (which does come in a jewel case, which I highly prefer over those cardboard ones used for the SACD) is the exact same as the SACD.  And it is awesome, one of the best remastered releases I've heard.  Hearing this really does make the original CD sound like a second-generation cassette dub.  The acoustic guitars have a presence and crispness that just wasn't there previously.  The bass and drums are fuller and deeper.  It's a cliche to say (of an old recording) that it \\"sounds as if it were recorded yesterday\\" - but I'd honestly say it applies here.    As for the music, it's all great; not a so-so track in sight.  As I see it, it can almost be mathmatically proven that this is THE perfect Stones album.  How one would go about doing that is beyond my grasp (though I am not doubting the possibility).

0375823352|3.0|This is the 3rd and final book in the Pullman triology, and it was just good enough that I managed to finish it.  I think I might have even enjoyed these books as a child, but they don't translate well to adult-readers like better childrens books do.  I found the characters too simplistic and the science too abominably implausible (and I do like sci-fi and fantasy) to recommend this book for grownups.  Each book does pick up the pace and get interesting in the last 50 pages or so... getting just good enough to convince me to pick up the next book and get disappointed again.  At least book 3 is better than book 2, but book 1 was still the best in my opinion (before the science and theology got too out of control).    One thing I do appreciate about this edition is the paper/font/printing.  I chose it over the trade paperback edition because it looked more inviting to read.  Without that, I probably never would have made it as far as book 3.
B000002GQJ|4.0|Still relevant after 37 years, why is this album so criticized by professional rock reviewers? What's wrong with a little peace, love and ecology? Some say the Moody Blues preach too much; I say it's just good advice and food for thought - along with some very accessible music. The above themes are here, along with an appealingly open and spacious soundscape, catchy melodies, a couple of upbeat rockers, and last but not least, gorgeous harmonies; Possibly because they're woven so tightly into the overall musical structure and therefore not immediately apparent, the Moody Blues' vocal harmonies are often overlooked or undervalued as one of their greatest strengths, especially bass player John Lodge's higher range and sometimes falsetto a visceral pleasure when blended into Hayward's range or with drummer Graeme Edge's lower register. (Yes, all band members sing!) Maybe they're no Beach Boys but the harmonies are a huge part of what gives Moodies music its power...Lightly spiritual but not quite a 'concept' album, the songs explore ecology (\\"balance\\"), universal love, and music itself, as in the Donovan-esque \\"Minstrel's Song\\". Though not what you'd call an angry group, the band's most famous tirade \\"Question\\" is here in its superior album version with guitarist Justin Hayward's trademark soaring vocals. Songs singing of disappoinment are here too, flautist Ray Thomas' \\"And The Tides Rushes In\\" and keyboardist Mike Pinder's \\"mellotron-drenched\\" (thanks to other reviewer for that excellent phrase!) crowd-pleaser \\"Melancholy Man\\". Questioning/pleading ballads such as the lightly rocking \\"It's Up to You\\" and sublime \\"Dawning of the Day\\" are here too. Just because the tracks are simply-presented, even childlike (\\"Tortoise and the Hare\\") does not mean they're not valid. Though not exactly great poetry (\\"the War of Love\\"?) I still wish they'd included the lyrics with this CD as with the LP release. That said, this remastered version sounds far better than the previous CD and vinyl releases...With not a note or emotion out of place, this passionate album has the tightest playing of all their LPs and is easily the best-sounding. With its smooth medley-like transitions, this album is also the best put-together of the Moody Blues'(long!) career.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|Never seen a film with subtitles before?  Or: you've seen a few but they felt pretentious and boring and you couldn't understand what the fuss was all about?<br /><br />Cinema Paradiso is the perfect film to teach you (or a friend or loved one) what the fuss is all about.  An ode to the movies, this film captures what it was like to witness the golden age of cinema in a small Italian town where the communal experience of film and of religion were intertwined.  It also captures precisely the nostalgia for lost youth, for innocence, for a first love, for an age when community was like family, and when life was not so fragmented.  This is one of those few genuine films that genuinely merit the emotional response they generate -- the story captured in this Giuseppe Tornatore masterpiece deserves every tear that is inevitably shed by the grown men and women who watch it, and every chuckle that it solicits from the child in all of us who sees it.  A perfect film -- that was as fresh (or even more so, since I'm closer to the age of the grownup main character) now as it was when I saw it in the theaters in 1990.<br /><br />With respect to the \\"newer\\" edition -- while I am aware that it was originally released in a much longer version than the one that appeared in the US, I think that the foreign release version is stronger. While, like other reviewers, I can appreciate the scenes that were deleted, for filling in some of the gaps of the shortened version, I prefer not to have those gaps filled in, since without them (when things are left ambiguous, when Elena's reasons for failing to meet up with Toto before he serves in the military are left a mystery, and when his one love remains no more than a memory) the theme of the film is stronger: you can never really go home and real life is not really like the movies, even though the movies can in some sense redeem and give value to real life.  Personally, I would recommend not seeing the \\"extended cut\\" -- at least not until after the shorter release version.  In any case this is a must-see film for lovers of film of all nationalities.release version.  In any case this is a must-see film for lovers of film of all nationalities.

0440238609|3.0|Keep in mind that even though a parent can tell a child not to do, say, read or listen to anything, most certainly their child's friends have parents that do let their children do those same things.  Their friends will share these books with your child and they WILL read them.      I am a devout Christian believing in what the Bible teaches, and the Bible clearly teaches that all God's children (young & old) have the freedom to choose for themselves in all things.  It would be much better to be involved with everything your child does, including what they are reading.  There is no better education for a child's future than to face what the future may hold together.    All the other books mentioned, such as, The Hobbit series, Harry Potter, etc. are listed as Science Fiction and Fantasy (nowhere are they listed as non-fiction) the same as the Philip Pullman series.  What we do, as well as, many of my friends is to let our children know that these books are works of fiction and fantasy before they read them or watch the movies.  We also explain what fiction and fantasy are.  We also read the books and generally find them entertaining and imaginative.  We in no way read them as a guide for life, they are just for entertainment and explain this to our children as well.  We can then have an educated discussion with our children and answer any questions that may be generated by the books with credibility.    An example -- Harry Potter has been deemed not worthy by many of my Christian friends and did not let their children read or watch any of the movies, even though they had never read the books themselves.  Unfortunately, one of my friend's two boys went to a friend's birthday party and all the children watched a Harry Potter movie.  My friends were not prepared to talk with their boys when they had questions.  My friends decided they needed to watch the movies, and in doing so, found they were very entertaining and imaginative.  After that, they found it easy to explain to their boys that it was all make-believe and nothing to be afraid of.     Another example - Friend's of mine had explained to their 2 year old that Harry Potter was just make-believe, that their was no such thing as magic, etc.  And that the movie was just for fun.  We were watching the movie at a holiday gathering when the little boy thought an adult was scared by the movie.  He went over to the adult and very seriously told him, \\"Don't be afraid, it's just make-believe, there's no such thing as magic\\".      Imagination, open discussion and the freedom to choose is what makes our world go round.  Without it, what a boring world we would live in.  I believe that is also called a \\"dictatorship\\".     The amount of stars I gave has no bearing because I have not yet read these books, I just wanted to give an alternative option.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|In Hollywood, repeat collaborations between certain actors and directors is a very popular, and generally lucrative prospect for all parties involved. Each partner in the collaboration walks away a winner, mostly because the movie that was worked on was a success, earning them more respect, bigger star power, and sometimes even critical acclaim. There are currently a few big name collaborations that have been prominent over the last few years, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh (\\"Ocean's 11-13\\"), Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan (\\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Prestige\\"), Kevin Smith and the batch of actors that have appeared in almost every one of his films (from \\"Mallrats\\" to \\"Clerks 2\\"). But there is one collaboration that has existed longer than the others, since the 1990 release of \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", the collaborators are, of course, Johnny Depp ('Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy) and director Tim Burton (\\"Batman\\"). What's impressive about this particular collaboration, sure the length of time is quite a feat by Hollywood standards, but the fact that this collaboration remains so powerful at the box office is astonishing. Almost every one of Johhny Depp's and Tim Burton's movies have turned a profit. In 2007, the duo came together yet again for the movie \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\", but before this film the two worked on the remake of the Roald Dahl children's classic \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", the novel that had been previously adapted in 1971 with \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\".    \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is the story of a sweet, good-hearted little boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who lives in a rundown shack with his mother, father, and both sets of grandparents. They have next to nothing to live on, and Charlie's birthday is coming up, and the only thing they can afford is one single candy bar. But not just any candy bar, a Wonka Bar, made at the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory located in thesame town. What makes the factory so mysterious is that not a single person has been seen coming or going from that factory in 15 years, that is until an announcement goes out to the whole world that 5 lucky people will be selected to visit the factory and meet the reclusive owner, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). Most of Charlie's life, good fortune has been rather elusive, but one lucky day changes everything as Charlie finds one of the 5 golden tickets that will give him access to Wonka's factory, and the wonders that Charlie will behold will change his life forever.    When I first heard about this movie's release, I wasn't all that excited to see it, in fact I didn't even want to see it at all. For starters, I didn't care a whole lot for the original movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" starring Gene Wilder, so I didn't really see what I would find of interest here. Plus, the original film was so well received by critics and audiences, that I didn't understand the point behind making this updated version. However, one day I recorded the movie off of the Showtime network, and figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I mean, it's Johnny Depp and Tim Burton together again, just how bad could this movie be.    Truth be told, the movie's not all that bad. It's obvious the reason that Depp and Burton continue collaborating is that there is a chemistry there that allows their work together to be so successful, and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" was at least a decent addition to their list of collaborations, though not their best by any means.     As one could easily tell from the previews, and possibly the DVD cover for that matter, the movie is strange, no doubt about that. There's a lot of weird things that occur in the movie, some that happened in the original, and some new, but the story is actually quite endearing as you watch this young boy's innocence begins to reach this reclusive man, showing him that reaching out and trusting in others will bring asense of belonging into his life. There were some elements to the film that I didn't care for, primarily the song numbers, they were just flat-out irritating to listen to, and I found myself skipping ahead to the end of the song as they did nothing more than slow the movie down. Some of the characters were extremely annoying, but that's not so much the actors fault as it was simply the way the character was meant to be, but I still didn't care for them and couldn't wait for them to get off the screen.    Performance wise, Johnny Depp did an excellent job as the quirky eccentric Willy Wonka, a role I was surprised that Depp was chosen for, but his chameleon-like ways with characters continued to serve him well in this movie. Some critics of the film felt Depp's portrayal was a bit too much like Michael Jackson, leaving them with a creepy feeling when Wonka was on screen. Personally I didn't read that into his Depp's performance, though I can maybe see how some might think that. The other standout performance was Freddie Highmore's, this talented young actor, who previously appeared in \\"Finding Neverland\\" with Johnny Depp, convincingly conveyed the innocence and naive view of the world that Charlie possessed, and he seemed like the perfect good kid, to the point he was a little unbelievable as a character. Charlie's character, in this film, was just too perfect, he listened and obeyed everything that Wonka requested, yet in the original, if I remember correctly both he and his grandpa snuck away to mess around in some bubble room that caused them to fly for a little bit. To me this change came off a little too much like director Tim Burton was trying too hard to make Charlie seem so good compared to the other kids, so he changed the story to make Charlie seem perfect. Now I will say that I've never read the book, and I've heard that the original film changed numerous elements from the book, so maybe the reason Burton's version didn't have the scene was because the book didn't, so I don't know, maybe Burton got it right in the end, either way I would have preferred a little more complexity to Charlie to make his character a little more believable.    The sets for this movie were all intricately detailed, from Charlie's family shack that was designed to be leaning as if it could fall over at any time, further illustrating the family's poor lot in life. To the extravagance of Wonka's factory, where each room was visually amazing, without feeling faked by CGI. Director Tim Burton's eye for the unusual and keen attention to detail was evident in his sets, and his strong imagination and storytelling ability was perfect for a movie such as this.    Even with good performances, extravagant set pieces, and imaginative storytelling by director Tim Burton, this movie is still only average in my opinion. The parts I liked were entertaining, and the parts I didn't weren't that major, but as a whole the movie just didn't grab me to the point that I felt like it was a great movie. I thought it was good to see once, but I probably would not choose to watch it again.    \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is rated PG for mild language.

I purchased this lens to use as my overall walking around lens, but found with some of the problems, I use another lens more often than this one. I decided to give it 4 out of 5 stars because when the lens is fully zoomed, the connecting pieces for the telescoping function seem a little shaky.  Also, when I am wearing the camera strap over my shoulder and the camera is on my side, the lens has a tendency to pop out -- Something I need to make sure does not happen less I hit something with it.

B0000012Y1|4.0|This 1971 Lohengrin remains in print in Germany, and it features a roster of DG's most notable vocal stars from the mid-Karajan era, the two obvious omissions being Fischer-Dieskau (who had already recorded the role of Telramund for EMI) and Karajan himself (whose ill-fated Lohengrin for the same label would be his only Wagnerian flop).  Among the versions I most value, this one doesn't stand high, despite the stellar casting. The pluses and minuses of the four principals and conductor are evenly divided.<br /><br />James King has a more powerful, heroically cast tenor than almost anyone else who recorded the part in the modern era, and we hear him in splendid voice - if only such a tenor could be singing the role today now that Heppner has retired from it (the Met has released a glorious  souvenir of him and Deborah Voigt conducted by Levine) and Jonas Kaufmann seems to have moved on from the part. King was a stolid vocal actor. Here he does a good job sounding tender - more to the swan than to Elsa - yet after awhile his steady, even tone production, impressive as it is, becomes boring. Even without much characterization, however, King remains a major asset.<br /><br />Gundula Janowitz had a voice that divided the critics, especially in her early years when she sounded so flutey as to verge on the inhuman, or angelic if you liked her tone. She easily encompasses the range of Elsa's role, bringing out the character's innocence. But it's more a fairy-tale innocence than the quality of a real woman. I was never moved and would place her below leading rivals on the order of Studer, Grummer, and even Jessye Norman, although Norman couldn't escape the hugeness of her sound.<br /><br />Thomas Stewart was such a great singer that I regret having to say that he is miscast as Telramund.  It's possible to find a sympathetic side to the role, even though he's the villain of the piece, but Stewart is every inch a Wotan. He's too noble by half, and he compensates by singing at topvolume throughout Act I. At the outset of Act II, his scene with Ortrud sounds exactly like Wotan and Brunnhilde when what we need is two meanies plotting their revenge.<br /><br />Gwyneth Jones had yet to sink into her phase of extreme wobble, and her soft singing as Ortrud is lovely (if, like Stewart, she's too noble for the role). She's a dramatic soprano in a part almost always given to dramatic mezzos, and set against an Elsa less other-worldly than Janowitz, Jones would sound too similar to the heroine. Here she's very impressive and manages not to screech in Ortrud's commanding invocation of the pagan gods in Act II.<br /><br />Kubelik wasn't to my mind a great conductor but like his Czech compatriot Karel Ancerl a very good one who could surpass himself on occasion.  Here he doesn't. Pace the admirers of this Lohengrin, the conducting lacks mystery and atmosphere. I rarely believed that we were in the domain of magic, much less grace. Kubelik's pacing is alert and, as is usual with him, on the quick side. But he fails to energize the opera from the inside. Karajan also had strange lapses in his recording, and both fall behind Abbado, Solti, and Levine.<br /><br />There's little to note about the rest. Heinrich and the Herald are splendidly sung. The Bavarian Radio SO plays well but not with real distinction. The chorus is fine but isn't encouraged to sound awestruck in the two miracle scenes at the beginning and end of the opera. The vintage analog sound is serviceable but needs remastering to soften the shrill trumpets and upper range frequencies in general. My four stars are a bit grudging, then, even though I now enjoy this recording more than I used to, thanks to the stretches of best singing.topvolume throughout Act I.

Here she's very impressive and manages not to screech in Ortrud's commanding invocation of the pagan gods in Act II.<br /><br />Kubelik wasn't to my mind a great conductor but like his Czech compatriot Karel Ancerl a very good one who could surpass himself on occasion.  Here he doesn't. Pace the admirers of this Lohengrin, the conducting lacks mystery and atmosphere. I rarely believed that we were in the domain of magic, much less grace. Kubelik's pacing is alert and, as is usual with him, on the quick side. But he fails to energize the opera from the inside. Karajan also had strange lapses in his recording, and both fall behind Abbado, Solti, and Levine.<br /><br />There's little to note about the rest. Heinrich and the Herald are splendidly sung. The Bavarian Radio SO plays well but not with real distinction. The chorus is fine but isn't encouraged to sound awestruck in the two miracle scenes at the beginning and end of the opera. The vintage analog sound is serviceable but needs remastering to soften the shrill trumpets and upper range frequencies in general. My four stars are a bit grudging, then, even though I now enjoy this recording more than I used to, thanks to the stretches of best singing.
B000PDZJ1W|2.0|As a long-time Mode fan I have 2 main problems with this album:  1)  Way too minimal in presentation.  DM is a band meant for lush sound & deep production and the tiny blips, bleeps & squeeks on here do them absolutely no justice.  2) Let's be honest about the instrumentals, Andy & Martin aren't playing and Dave isn't singing.  What we have is a musical piece written by Gore and interpreted by The Producer.  They aren't really \\"Depeche tracks\\".    Overall though, the songwriting is still strong and I can only \\"Dream On\\" about what this album could have sounded like.

Or can you admit that deep down you believe you deserve a jetta and a crappy little 3% annual raise? Better decide explicitly before continuing down this path because you'll either finally shake off the shackles of mediocrity and morality stained sense of justice, or you'll waste about $30.<br /><br />Like old stone tablet says: \\"Caveat emptor...\\"
B000CNE092|5.0|This movie is fun to watch for the whole family, my family has watched this movie 3 times since we got it.We even invited my brother and his family over for a video popcorn night just so they could share the magic that is this movie,his kids loved it just as much as mine. I would reccomend this movie to anyone with or without children.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Blood Diamond is a very good drama, probably one of the best about the terrible situation of Africa. Leonardo DiCaprio gets one of his best roles as a young cynical South African, who discovers loyalty, love and conscience. It's noble, brilliant, beautifully written and directed.
B00005JLCI|3.0|This is a very fast-pased movie.  It uses the acts and scenes and even the \\"additional scenes\\" from the entire play.  I think the movie is a bit too overdone.  However, there are many great and enduring scenes.    Dhevan G.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Look, it's a pretty sad situation when the hero and ab worshipping culture we're all spawned in leans into the back seat of the car and smacks us saying that a flick like this is \\"homoerotic\\". It's a little like saying that your sexual orientation can be deduced from your level of enjoyment of salty snacks.<br /><br />Forget all that soci-psycho-babble and instead invest at least $700 in a good surround sound system and pop this DVD in for 2 hours of the absolute best sword fighting, bully besting, buddy system movie released ever.<br /><br />If after watching this, you can't appreciate why everyone secretly wishes clothelining wasn't banned in the NFL, then you're just not even trying!
B000TEUCFA|5.0|Stacey Kent is a huge hit in the U.K., and with her angelic voice, it's no wonder.<br /><br />She has made her mark her in the States as well, though not with quite the success enjoyed across the pond.  Perhaps this c.d. will change things.  IMO, it is her best.<br /><br />Ms. Kent has been known previously as a standards singer, but on this--her debut on Blue Note--she branches out.  Ironically, with the inclusion of some \\"originals\\" (well, music by her husband and saxophone bandmate, Jim Tomlinson, and novelist Kazuo Ishiguro), she reveals herself as one of the finest interpreters of modern song around.<br /><br />In particular, the highlight for me is her treatment of the Bergmans' \\"So Many Stars.\\"  IMO, this is the finest cover ever of that great song.  Ms. Kent hits just the right note of regret--not overdramatic, but definitely there.<br /><br />But there are other delights to savor on this disc.  I love: the sly nudge and wink on \\"The Ice Hotel\\"; the finger-snappin' cool on \\"Ces petits Riens\\"; the jazzy, cosmopolitan feel on the title track; the light, dancing quality of \\"Samba Saravah\\"; and the state of bliss on \\"What a Wonderful World\\" (with John Parricelli's guitar a major contributor to that state).  And this disc is probably the only time--outside of a barbershop quartet convention--that you'll hear the novelty song from the '20's, \\"Hard-Hearted Hannah.\\"  Like everything else here, it works.<br /><br />Of the Stacey Kent c.d.'s with which I'm familiar, I think this is her best.  Definitely recommended.  RC
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Half Nelson is first and foremost an UNFORGETTABLE PERFORMANCE by Ryan Gosling, just perfect as a young teacher who discovers so many things about himself when he gets close to one of his student (impressive Shareeka Epps). They do need each other even if they're very different. It's beautiful because it's a very simple story: the meeting of two people that will change their life. Definitely a must have.
0765348780|4.0|Stephen Erickson is a very intelligent writer.  I recommend this book.  The world is vividly described.  His characters are well defined.  The story is pleasingly complicated.  There are unforeseen twists.  In general the book is a satisfying effort.   There are, however, some problems that a potential buyer should be aware of.     This book is not an easy read.  Character and location names increase difficulty as well as some of the banter that takes place.  I felt I had to pay very close attention or I would lose my place in the story.  A friend of mine that reads much faster than I do reported the same problem.     The author's use of magic is unfortunate.  One of my greatest complaints in fantasy is when magic comes into play just as all seems lost.  Suddenly a person or thing appears that is much more powerful than the original threat.  Bad guy is destroyed and good guys continue on with a few scratches.  As beautifully as this story was written it was almost ruined by this technique.  If the truth be told I was very disappointed with the way the author incorporated magic at the climax of the book.  It really didn't make sense and the story deserved better.      Gardens of the Moon is the first in a series.  Steven Erikson is far too talented to disdain his following books.  Hopefully he begins handling the climatic portions of his stories as gracefully as he manages the rest of the plots. I'll deal with the difficulty level of the writing.
B00005JNTX|5.0|You can't really understand the total pop culture obsession with Jessica Alba until you've seen this film. The cowboy bar dance marks a moment in pop culture--the cross roads of the stripper-friendly environment we all secretly endorse known as Las Vegas, and the ginormous media machine that is Madison Avenue advertising at its best. But I digress...<br /><br />At it's core, Sin City is sitting on top of the powerful thrumming engine that is film noire. Why seedy, caricature populated, punch to the jaw stories make us glad we lost our virginity before 18 is a total mystery, but they do. Sure it's uniquely colored, sure it's got an amazing cast, and sure this movie was scripted by the unholy hand of fate itself for Mickey Rourke, but it's appealing because it taps our fantasies--all of us. Want proof that the base of your brainstem is accurately characterized as \\"reptilian\\"? See this movie and quietly smile as Rourke pulls off \\"nullo\\" on a big screen in theatres across america.<br /><br />Deep down this is who we are. It's who we've always been. So get over your v-chip and your ratings system. Just let this one wash over you with the same destructive self satisfaction of a shot of tequila followed by a fat cigar.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|While the bad guys aren't particularly scary looking people, the movie overall is great. Nicholas Cage really delivers in this movie and the special effects are not too shabby either.
0307275639|4.0|I wasn't sure if this book would live up to its hype.  I was surprised at how much it effected me.  Definitely a worthwhile read.
0060012358|5.0|I posted a reply to a comment made a while back by a concerned mother, and wanted to repost it in the larger comments section because I feel it's important to get out there. The reviewer noted that the book discusses cruelty, starvation, cannibalism and animal fighting. For the record, Terry Pratchett is NOT OK with any of these terrible things, as is made abundantly clear in the book! He describes these scenes with tangible disgust. And they are there because there are important moral lessons about courage, bravery, altruism and friendship to be learned.    I'm an adult fan of Terry Pratchett's with no children, and while it is a rather dark book, I know that I would have been able to handle it back when I was in 5th grade or so. Then again I was an only child and very mature as my parents treated me as an equal who found out her own capabilities rather than was kept from the darker elements of the world \\"for her own good.\\" A running theme in Pratchett's work is that children are far more intelligent and able to discern right from wrong than adults give them credit for. I would have loved to have read this book as a child! Don't dismiss it out of hand. It is challenging, but far more rewarding than reading, say, \\"Mr. Bunnsy\\".    Finally, although I'm sure I don't have to spell it out after my rants above, I absolutely loved this book. And I do understand why a parent might be concerned about a child getting scared by some of the more sinister elements of T.A.M.A.H.E.R. But the overall messages of tolerance and friendship are so positive that I think every kid should read this as soon as they are mentally and emotionally able. Let your children decide; I bet they'll surprise you.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I can sum this up in one word...FINALLY! I still watch this film in awe.
0060763892|5.0|James Rollins does it again. His books keep you sucked in until the very last page. I could not get my nose out of this book until I was done. The only problem is that for the first time, Rollins doesn't provide a completely full ending. If you don't want to be left hanging, take my father's route and don't read this book until the next book comes out. I personally loved it. The book is a lot like Dan Brown's books but keep you sucked in even more. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys a action packed book.
B000I2J6K0|2.0|No one else found this woman annoying as hell? Its an ok workout if I put her on mute and use my ipod. By the way who is on the cover? It looks like an entirely different person one you put the dvd on. Her stomach is hanging out and I just found her revolting. She needs James Denton to come on just so people will buy this. I tried to pass it off to a pregnant friend of mine and she gave it back to me cause she couldn't stand her either- ya uh ha your ok your ok. I'll take Denise Austin anyday over this lady.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|It is an okay movie but leaves too many details out for it to be a great movie. They give you a twist at the end and so it is a satisfying ending but still if they had given more details or more depth to the characters then it would have been a better movie. Not really a family movie because there is a bit of violence.<br /><br />A magic act for one magician turns into a full scale search for a terrorist team really to end the world as we know it!
B000UJBYD8|5.0|I like this Cd way better than Beyond good and evil that had a few good songs, this one is way more consistent and powerful as a whole. It sounds fresh and you go through the whole record easily. The Cult is back and rocks again!
B00005JP5P|5.0|The intensity of this movie was amazing. The visuals with the soundtrack plus the pacing of the plot had me on the edge of my seat. Yeah, ok the plot is seemingly unrealistic, but entertaining to a certain perspective. If you ignore the impossibility of \\"re-igniting the sun\\" (there is a chance, apparently something called a q-ball or some crazy phyicist term) and put yourself in front of a nice TV, blackened environment, clear surround stereo, you'll agree that this easily one of the best movies of 2007. I was quite impressed with the cast and the pyshological effects that are presented in the movie. This is the Blue Ray DVD that will convince me to purshase a big LCD and a quality stereo system.
B00005YUNY|5.0|An incredible experience.  Yes have brought classical and Rock together in an exciting and brilliant way.  Old and 'new' songs included.  Would love to have a CD of the show for my car.
0440238609|1.0|These books are really not for children as young as 9 or 10.  If you want a longer fantasy book, try Redwall.  It's great and doesn't have all the darkness that Pullman books have.  Also, it bothers me that the new film trailers for The Golden Compass leave you feeling like this book/movie is a follow up to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  Not so.  Pullman didn't even care for CS Lewis and certainly not for Lewis' beliefs.  Personally, I don't want to expose my children to such a dark tale at a preteen age.  They can make their own decision when they are older.  There are so many great fantasy tales out there.  Why read this one when there are better age appropriate ones?  Try M. L'Engle as well.  Amazon has great reference guides to help choose better books.  Good luck!  I have a 10 year old reader sitting behind me as I type this and I would never encourage her to read Pullman books at her age.
B00005JPVL|4.0|If there's at least one thing anyone can agree on about \\"Shoot 'Em Up,\\" it's that you know what you're getting.  Clive Owen as Mr. Smith runs hither and thither, shooting up people and things, munching on over-sized carrots and basically turning the world on with his song.  Er, his gun.  His many, many guns.  And that's it.  Should I go on?<br /><br />I guess I should.<br /><br />The plot is as contrived as the action: a pregnant woman is harrassed by about eighty bad guys who want to shoot her in the belly.  Smith, our reluctant hero, jumps in and starts killing people with carrots and severing umbilical cords with bullets.  After he absconds with the infant, he is chased relentlessly by a bug-eyed sniper named Hertz (Giamatti, who seems to LOVE being the smarmy, wise-cracking bad guy for once).  With the help of a lactating prostitute and his otherworldly prowess with a trigger, Smith figures out why this baby's life is on the line, and just why he should care.<br /><br />At its most uncomfortable, the tale is basically about very evil men trying to pop a cap into a very cute infant.  At its most obtuse, the entire plot is one long commercial for ... wait for it ... gun control.  The irony, it needn't be said, is intentional, although the film's target audience may find it indecipherable (or, more likely, completely beside the point).  I suppose that's what you get when you try to make a movie that is both a weighty public service announcement AND an unflinching parody of itself.<br /><br />Where the film falters (if at all), it isn't necessarily in the overkill.  In fact, if you think the movie is overdone, then you've already missed the point (or aren't a fan of the point; either way).  It's the movie's attempts to be consciously cute that stand out the most, much like the baby-in-a-bulletproof-vest that forms it's core.  Maybe I'm nit-picking, but it was good enough for me to have Smith gnawing away on that carrot and uttering things like, \\"Eat your vegetables.\\"  Then the movie goes and gives him massive white bandages on his hands (which look like massive white gloves), and tosses him the line, \\"What's up, Doc?\\"<br /><br />I guess I'll take moments like these, where the self-consciousness oozes out of each hot, powdered frame.  Where Hertz, after Smith has escaped yet again, yells, \\"Do we just suck, or is he really that good?\\"  Wry to a fault, though the film may be, it's also a teat full of testosterone, and any guy who's ever wanted the firepower of Wile E. Coyote and the panache of Bugs Bunny will probably be pleased.  After all, hold a Y chromosome up to your eye, and it looks an awful lot like a rifle-sight.es him massive white bandages on his hands (which look like massive white gloves), and tosses him the line, \\"What's up, Doc?\\"    I guess I'll take moments like these, where the self-consciousness oozes out of each hot, powdered frame.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|\\"Supernatural\\" is proof of the fact that great things come when you least expect it. It was fall and new TV series were about to start. I needed something new to watch and \\"Supernatural\\"'s trailers and teasers caught my eye. Why not check it out? I wanna find out what Jared Padalecki gets so freaked about on his ceiling... It can't be that bad; it can hardly be something we haven't seen before, right? Oh, but how very wrong I was...     Even after the first episode I was hooked - not really knowing what it was that made me long for next week on the WB. And that's what \\"Supernatural\\" does. It has this charm, this vibe that just grows on you. I'm totally smitten with this show!     Especially on the two DVD releases it's somewhat obvious where that charm comes from. It seems that everyone working the show - the actors right down to the PAs - are really enjoying their work and strive to give us - the viewers - good quality TV. And WELL DONE, GUYS!     It's not your average cheep entertainment. It's got layers and complicated characters who develop throughout the show. This is the end of Season Two and SO many things have happened already! They've loved, they've lost, they've been all over. And yet it's not like you feel that the writers can't possibly come up with new stuff... I've got complete faith in this team.     I no longer wonder why I love this show. It's all the above, it's the way the sets are lit - the Supernatural color -, it's the short (and therefore non-cheesy) intro that changes every season and gets cooler and cooler, it's the wicked \\"soundtrack\\" that actually made me get into classic rock and finally it's the fact that they're able to make a character out of a friggin' car! (My biggest question about the start of season two was \\"What'll happen to the car?!\\" I literally gasped when the Impala got crumpled in the coalition... How weird is that?!)    In conclusion, \\"Supernatural\\" is totally worth a spot on your DVD shelf... Just make it easily accessibleas you'll be reaching for it frequently...     Louise,  Denmark
B000005ALN|5.0|I accidentally discovered this CD when visiting a potential lover at his home.  I realized later on that it was the music that turned me on, not the guy.  Bye bye Bill, hello George!  This music is so tender, so sexy, so heartfelt, I swoon every time I listen which is literally every night I'm home.  The more I listen, the more I love it!
B00005Y1TL|5.0|The first 3 tracks on this album are so simple, yet so great. The melodies speak to me of peace, bliss, higher consciousness, compassion, yea, all the finer, nobler abilities of humanity. They have a loving, innocent child-like quality that I love to hear. These lift my spirit.   The rest of the songs, to varying degrees, tend toward more of a worldly feel, more towards the abrasive, cynical, jaded, whereas the first 3 seem to be completely unchained from all the baser worldly aspects and worries these times we find ourselves in so readily and abundantly produce.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This is one of those Masterpieces of Art that slowly grows in you. Original and inspired, honest, humorous and full of emotion, all at the same time without being pretentious. Can be listened to again and again, since every song is full of layers - if you know what I mean.    The only sad thing is that this was the first album I heard from the guy, so when I listened to 'Michigan' I was rather disappointed. That one is ok, but you don't yet see the genius that is to be found in this one.    (I really like 'The Predatory Wasps of the Palisades' (track 15) and 'Come on! Feel the Illinoise' (track 3), btw.)

B000000W5L|5.0|Remember all the top 100 albums of all time type lists. Albums come and go. 15 years ago U2 would have had a multitude of albums in the top 100. Now well who knows, but 'Exile on Main Street' is always there or there abouts.<br /><br />This has all the swagger you would expect from the Stones. It maintains a link to their roots, which were essentially Chuck Berry and the Blues (indeed Exile includes Robert Johnson and Skip James covers), but the whole album has a completly different feel. Keith Richards guitar playing gets as much credit as anything for this. The album starts with with 'Rocks Off' and 'Rip this Joint'. Has there ever been a more rocking start to an album. It just carries on. 'Torn and frayed' is great, 'Shine A Light' etc etc.<br /><br />The Stones themselves knew this was a great album as I've heard Mick Jagger quoted as saying they became complacent after its release in his words - \\"F**k it. We've done it\\".
B00006674X|5.0|This movie came at the end of Elvis' fim contract and as a result suffered from the public's boredom with his previous formulaic musicals. I am a fan and I liked all his films and love movies like 'Follow that Dream', 'Girl Happy', 'Kid Galahad' and others but eventually the general public became fed up. This is unfortunate as had this movie been made near the start of his film career (say after'Blue Hawaii') I think it would have become one of his fans most liked films. The story has a slight edge to it - set in an inner city, tough neighbourhood where a group of nuns has been sent to work with the local doctor, Elvis. Presley looks terrific, lean and mean. No outstanding songs but at the end as he sings a mock gospel the camera pans across a statue of Christ on the cross then moves to Elvis, blasphemous or simple coincidence? Barbara McNair provides the most dramatic performance as a nun battling with her doubts and Mary Tyler Moore is a pleasant foil to Elvis. Not a great film but for Elvis fans definitely one to see.
1582701709|4.0|Although The Secret may have a few bumps along the way, overall its message is about positive thinking.  So no matter how you critique it, the message that you can bring positive experiences your way is the truth. I also recommend the book Healing Connection; Poems and Psalms that Heal the Soul.

0751532711|5.0|I wish I had these CDs (or book) from my teens. This is a fantastic book to read (and listen to - I prefer audio). If you wish to understand why you are in the rat race and having to wake up and go to work even if you don't feel like it, try this book for the answers.    I call it \\"Truths\\" because I have come to realise that the classic idea of going to school and getting high grades and becoming a specialist even to PhD level and/or having a high paying job, are  not quite the recipes for financial freedom.     I have also bought \\"CashFlow Quadrant\\" & \\"Guide to Investment\\" and the \\"CashFlow 101 Game Board\\" - which I think are follow ons from the Rich Dad Poor Dad book.     For me, the result of all of these is a complete turn around in my understanding of how money works and putting myself on the track to exit the rat race one day - hopefully soon!
0618680004|5.0|This is from page 361: \\"The atheist view is correspondingly life-affirming and life-enhancing, while at the same time never being tainted with self-delusion, wishful thinking, or the whingeing self-pity of those who feel life owes them something.\\" Can you imagine the world we could have if everyone had this attitude? This line makes more sense and has more meaning for me than any line in any holy book I've ever read.     The more I read on the topic of non-belief, atheism, or whatever you choose to call it, the more I am convinced that logic, understanding, and reason continue to be subverted in the name of religion.

0316010669|3.0|Sometimes snap judgments are correct (rigged card games; analysis of statues); sometimes they're not (Amadou Diallo; Diet Coke).  At the end of the day, what has really been learned?  Should we trust our snap judgments or not?  And what distinguishes a proper snap judgment situation from one where a longer analysis is required?  The book never provides the answers, just a lot of admittedly-interesting vignettes and study synopses.<br /><br />So -- interesting book to read but not particularly helpful as an analytic aid.

B0009MAO46|2.0|For many months, we've been allowing our tots to watch this movie (and other CGI-type \\"classics\\" like Monsters, Toy Story II, Bugs Life).  Of late, we realized, with horror, that our kids' recent usage of snide and obnoxious remarks has been due to these \\"modern kids classics.\\"---comments like \\"WHERE'S MY FOOD!!!\\" (courtesy of \\"Bugs Life\\"); \\"STUPID!\\"; \\"YOU IDIOT\\" (Toy Story) ....and the like.  Even Monsters has the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing each other (especially by the villain Randall).  On retrospect, all the Disney movies in our collection are tame by comparison, and far less objectionable if even at all.  (e.g., Cinderella, Little Mermaid, etc).  I choose politically correct over slyly entertaining, any day!  Those \\"modern classics\\" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc----but why give the kids a head-start on learning objectionable phrases and vocabulary that they're going to learn later?

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This tv series is about Dexter Morgan (played by Michael C. Hall), a murderer that hides in plain sight, working for the police force. I didn't think that premise was too interesting, so I didn't pay \\"Dexter\\" any attention until a few days ago, when I happened to watch one of its episodes by chance. I was hooked...<br /><br />By now, I have watched all the episodes included in the first season, and plan to watch the second one. As I previously thought, the fact that this show is about a serial killer that preys on serial killers is creepy. However, this show pulls that premise off, and brilliantly so.<br /><br />Dexter says that \\"Everybody hides what they are, at least some of the time\\". If you watch this tv series, you will understand why he says that. Stay away from it if you dislike dark humour, but give \\"Dexter\\" a try if you don't mind it and appreciate dry wit. Highly recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat

It was a very stylish film that I liked well enough to order for myself the same day I saw it on television. It was a thing of beauty that told an addictively involving story.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|MAN MUST EXPLORE! And, yes indeed, Galileo was right.<br /><br />This tiny piece of docudrama, as someone else said in these pages, should not just belong on shelves of any American Family, but rather be part of anyone's Movie Collection in the world.<br /><br />Although I agree with somebody else's opinion that this could have been more space-oriented and less politics-oriented, we have to remind ourselves that in those years we were in the midst of the Cold War, as well as been entangled in a tragic war in Vietnam.<br /><br />This is why this story retelling of the conquest of the Moon, and yes, also of space, sends us a message that even in such bleak times, there was a light. A light that shone very bright in the darkness of our world, and brought us a sparkle of hope for the entire human race.<br /><br />Despite its political and even military implications, as it was in the beginning, this project, to land a man, or men, on the Moon, developed into something totally different, Something noble, something useful and something creative.<br /><br />In fact, my favorite episode of the 12 in this collection, is most poignantly \\"Galileo Was Right\\", dealing with the first of the three \\"J\\"-step Missions of the Apollo, or as commonly known, the Apollo 15 Mission.<br /><br />This, in my view, is the very best episode of them all, because it truly expresses and resumes why we went to the Moon in the first place.<br /><br />Also, it is a great, and very short lesson, on how to learn to open our own eyes, look around us and truly \\"explore\\", not just the Moon, but rather Nature and Space as such.<br /><br />It teaches us to \\"read\\" the great book that Nature has opened for us and never to shut our minds. In fact, best of all, there is even an original quote by Plutarch in it, with which I opened this review and closes the circle.<br /><br />How many teachers are out there doing exactly this? Lighting a fire in their student's souls and minds?<br /><br />It takes just a sparkle, a tiny bit of curiosity and a decent dose of passion to turn a simple student into an explorer, a scholar, a motivated and driven scientist.<br /><br />What is more important, is that the subtext to this episode seems to be that there are simply not \\"lousy students\\", but rather \\"very bad teachers\\" out there. And if this applied to Astronauts, which were already very bright and open-minded, just imagine what this would entice, if you had your own child being taught by a \\"blank-minded\\" teacher.<br /><br />The entire series deals with very human emotions and concerns. It is a journey through the minds of those who traveled and landed on the Moon, and it is also the exploration of those that stood next to these men, supporting them in every step to reach their goals.<br /><br />In my view, this is a mini-series that should be screened in every school on this Planet, at least once a year.<br /><br />This journey takes the viewer far beyond Space and the Moon, it takes him  through the thoughts, the worries, the grief and the emotions of true men, not heroes, not action figures, but true living and breathing people, who decided to sacrifice their lives in an adventure to benefit, and yes, for a brief moment even unite All Mankind in a noble endeavor.<br /><br />At first, to be very honest, when I watched this series the first time, I started nagging with the fact that the actors did not resemble one bit to their historic counterparts (to me, a greater effort could have been made to cast actors who even just slightly, could \\"pinpoint\\" who they played).<br /><br />But after repeated viewings, this nag slowly disappeared, being replaced with an admiration for its contents and the messages these episodes tried to convey, proving me totally out of place in criticizing such a work of art.<br /><br />Yes indeed, I learned to bridle my prejudices and in fact started to use and open my mind to the experience that is \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\".<br />Because it is far more thanyour usual Mini-Series. It is a school of thought and beyond that, it is a class on human ethics.<br /><br />If you, like me, were \\"captured\\" by the so-called \\"conquest of space\\" and beyond, the \\"conquest of the Moon\\", you will certainly don't want to miss out on this addition to your space collection in your video file.<br /><br />I also want to thank all those involved in the production of this, in my humble view, tiny masterpiece of story-telling, with a particular reference to Tom Hanks, who also appeared in it and was executive producer of the series, who in my view has refreshed a tiny bit the stuffy air that one usually breaths from Hollywood.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, joins the ranks of visionaries like Selznick, Zanuck, Mankiewicz, Welles and Spielberg in acting upon his ideas and passions and sharing them with us in such a vivid way.<br /><br />Also a great many thanks to the excellent cast who makes it all so believable on screen.

B00006LLNV|4.0|Julie Taymor's \\"Frida\\" was a visually interesting movie that failed to really capture Frida Kahlo (the politics of the movie were too shy for one thing), but it featured a nice score by Elliot Goldenthal, who has sense moved in with Taymor and recently produced the soundtrack for her \\"Across The Universe\\" musical. There are some interesting tracks here that carry the flavor and essence of classic Mexico. \\"The Floating Bed\\" has some beautiful sounds and strings. \\"El Conejo\\" is a rousing number from the urban Mexico of Frida's time, the post-revolution period where the nation was struggling to define itself after a 10-year insurrection that radically transformed society. Mexican singing legend Chavela Vargas (who knew Frida) makes two great appearances with the classic \\"ranchera\\" \\"Paloma Negra\\" and a gritty take on \\"La Llorona.\\" However the artist who most stands out in this disc is Lila Downs. Downs has made a name for herself in the world music stage, producing some of the best Latin folk recordings of the past few years. Here she creates a dark, deep atmosphere with some stylish, emotional numbers like \\"Alcoba Azul\\" and the hypnotic, Oscar-nominated \\"Burn It Blue\\" featuring Caetano Veloso. Downs' rendition of \\"La Llorona\\" is a beautiful homage to the classic mariachi style. The only thing that keeps \\"Frida\\" from being a masterful soundtrack is that without the contributing artists and their songs we are left with Goldenthal's somewhat bare score which recycles most of the same gimmicks. There are some nice, gorgeous moments, but they are too few. It seems as if Goldenthal only sticks to one rhythm or melody, instead of producing a true, red-blooded take on the classic sounds of post-revolutionary Mexico. No matter, \\"Frida,\\" has enough to make it stand out as a noteworthy soundtrack that reaches for some impressive artistic heights.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I was impressed with this latest release from the first listening. Unlike some others of Mark's general age group,(Jimmy, you know who you are) who continue to release music that, as Randy Newman so appropriately put it,  \\"sounds like a record that I made, Just not as good!\\" Mark refines his skills as a writer and producer with every release. I have always been hooked on his lyrics and these are both insiteful and I would guess often autobiographical. My favorites from this release are, True Love Will Never Fade, Heart Full of Holes, Punish the Monkey (I went through this about 9 years ago) and Let It All Go. In addition, I have always been a big fan of his guitar work since the early days of Dire Straits.
B000002LND|3.0|What I liked about this CD is that it shows Madonna's maturation over the years.  Most of the songs are superficial, but it shows spots of brilliance with \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Vogue.\\"   All-in-all, it is a worthwhile CD that reflects accurately on Madonna's talent.  Unfortunately, I think she sold out for pop-culture when she could have created quality songs that contained meaning over money.  But, as the album shows, no one can argue that she has a head for business.
B000001ELF|5.0|I still remember heading to the store after hearing that the solo albums were out.  I had enough money for exactly one, and was pretty disappointed to learn that the store I was shopping at only got one copy of each, and Gene's was already sold.  So I reluctantly settled on Ace's and headed home to listen.    The first thing that stood out was the energy of it.  Ace's voice isn't technically great, but on his solo album, he sang with a lot of force and energy, and it worked to his advantage.  Combine this with Anton's aggressive and very technically solid drumming, Ace's in-your-face guitar work, and Eddie Kramer's production, and it made for an album that just had a fun and enjoyable energy that helped propel all the songs along.    Another surprise was the consistency of the material.  Not all songs are as strong as the others, but there are no clunkers and all of them are done with care and each have their own vibe.    What's really helped this album stand the test of time for me is that there are a lot of subtleties that keep it interesting.  Tempo changes during leads, layers of acoustic, electric, and synthesized guitars, and little things like during the chorus of Ozone where Ace presents the same chords in varying ways.    Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed with each of the other solo albums.  I bought Gene's next and thought even though it was interesting, I just felt for the most part that it just didn't work.  Paul's was decent but totally marred by lousy production (I later learned he fired Jeff Glixman and produced it himself - big mistake), and Peter's was just a different animal altogether.  The only one to capture something special was Ace.

B000GG4ZBI|5.0|Masterfully written, unable to put it down, I read this book from cover to cover. It left me wanting more.

1400063515|4.0|A black swan is a surprising or virtually unpredictable event; that can have a massive impact. Nassim Taleb's observation is that after the fact, we concoct an narrative to explain it. Dangerous behavior at best. Google and 9/11 are black swans according to Taleb. After explaining the narrative is dangerous the author proceeds to deliver 308 pages of it! That is the way this book goes, it is hard reading, words you are not familiar with, jabs at the French followed by text in French, games within games. Yet, there are tons of pearls, as Taleb says, the test of an author is whether you reread his work and I will have to reread this to comprehend more.    A big chunk of the book is describing two subsets of our world are explained: Mediocristan and Extremistan.  Mediocristan is the world of the regular Joe, at least most of the time. Earnings are related to the amount of work you do, things are predicable or at least mostly so. You can explain most events with a Gaussian distribution, a bell curve.  Extremistan is the world of rock stars, book authors, G- where unfairness reigns, Joanne K. Rowling made several orders of magnitude more money on royalties than I did, the unexpected happens, Black Monday and Tuesday, the stock crash October 28, 29 1987 caused the US Stock market to decline over 22%. If you can describe Extremistan then you do it with  power laws and fractal geometry not bell curves.    He challenges our notions about success; some companies and some CEOs that we think of as role models probably just got lucky. This was very helpful for me, I just finished reading Seduced by Success which has a similar message. He draws on his experience as a trader, a quant, in the financial markets and tells the reader in essence, these guys are just guessing. His financial advice is to put about 85% of your investment into something very safe and stodgy like T-Bills and then use the remaining 15% on high risk, high payoff and adjust the percentages based on your risk appetite.    There is a fictional component to this non-fiction book, at one point he is telling the story of a lady author and her paramours and it seemed impossible, it was, she was fiction. Another word picture was a true man of the world (Fat Tony) who had his own social engineering approach to the famous coin flipping problem. The Fat Tony's of the world do not allow even distribution to happen.    People are either going to like this book or hate it, I have a thick skin, I choose to like it, he made me work pretty hard to get through the book, but the mind is a muscle and I for one thank Taleb. I predict statisticians, academics and Frenchmen are going to despise this work.

The accounts of Frankl's experiences in the Nazi death camps in part one alone will make your trifles seem like a pleasant Sunday in the park.  Frankl describes how he was able to keep his will to live alive at Auschwitz. It was by keeping his mind from disintegrating that he was able to survive the horrors of the Nazi death camps. In the end he is completely dehumanized but his psyche is intact. I have read adventure stories of men at war, men at sea, faced against unforgiving storms or mountain ranges, but no tail to me rings of such incredible human strength and perseverance. This is a story of incredible human will power.<br /><br />Since this man was a Doctor of Psychiatry before the war it doesn't surprise anybody that he came out of his experience with a new school of Psychiatry. The second part of the book which outlines his Logos theory didn't interest me much although his differences with Freudian psychology I found valid based on my readings of some of Freud's books. A layman's knowledge of psychiatry ought to get you through this.<br /><br />Whatever the case, if you ever think that you are having a tough time, this book is instant therapy. It should be required reading in this country.

0553208845|5.0|I first read this book in high school but I have gone back to it over and over again. To me it is a timeless classic. Whether it is historically accurate or not isn't important to me. What's more important is that it is a great way to begin to understand eastern philosophy.<br /><br />When I read this book in my youth, I couldn't digest it because I was mired in western thinking and Christianity. Later in life it has been a guidepost to me. There is a profound undertone of sadness in the book as time progresses and youth is lost. Too me this is a novel of lost youth and a philosophical clash between east/west. Siddhartha gives up his way  of life and beliefs several times and wanders a divergent path, only to be brought back to the river and the ferryman. The ferry man remains there to escort Siddhartha across the river and eventually takes him in. I believe these crossings represent the different passages in life when we alter our own destinies through are actions, whether knowingly or not.In the end Siddhartha fades into a broken form of enlightenment. A sort of circularity of time and life's passages is in tension with the linear no going back nature of time.<br /><br />To me the river is the overwhelming symbol and allegory. It is at once completely diverse but whole, composed of infinitely large numbers of water molecules flowing as one entity, linking the glaciers and the sea.  The eastern concept of the unity and disunity of life, the yen/yang is completely encompassed within this symbol. Time flows by in the book cruelly like the river and strips away youth and folly, leaving a hardened wise man. Sons and Fathers blend together, this is magnified when Siddhartha's own son rejects him and steals from him. In the end Siddhartha becomes the Buddha-but his passage is one of suffering.<br /><br />Just for the lyrical pace of the prose and the exposure to eastern philosophy this little book is a must read. I keep coming back to it time and time again. Each time I get a little something different out of it.different out of it.

B000FJA1BO|5.0|I remember when I first read this novel nearly ten years ago, I felt really in touch with the lead character. I read part of it in Outdoor magazine and when the novel came out I snapped it up and devoured it. To me, Chris McCandless is the Holden Caufield of my generation. A young man completely alienated by society and searching to find himself outside  of societal norms-a psychological wilderness. When I read this book I was reminded of Jack London, Jack Kerouac, and Leo Tolstoy almost simultaneously.  But there is also a certain folly and misguided aspect to the odyssey of Chris McCandless. I was left with the impression that this young man also had instincts that were perhaps suicidal, that his willingness to give up his privileged life and a small fortune and roam the highways was a mask for some mental disturbance, perhaps a mental illness.<br /><br />I relate to this character deeply. I spent a lot of my twenties moving from town to town, living in the back of my truck. I have done long solo outings in the woods, I've lived like a hobo. I myself grew up in an upper middle class, intellectual family. Krakauer obviously identifies with the character and his deep alienation, his personal rift from the mainstream ideals. He also does a good job pointing out the folly and the lost cause of McCandless's final foray into the Alaskan wilderness. Inadequately prepared with little experience or exposure to the specialized knowledge and discipline that it takes to solo in the harsh unforgiving wilderness, McCandlesses sojourn becomes a very sad and tragic one indeed. The undertone here again points to a self-destructive personality disorder. This type of escapism can't last forever or one becomes completely anti-social. At some point all of us alienated lost souls need to snap out of it to some degree-I definitely identified with the struggles this man had going on in his head.<br /><br />Now that this is a movie I can't wait to see it. I believe in time this novel will become an important part of modern American literature and a pathway towards discovering and understanding some of the alienation that was common for Gen X'ers like myself.ortant part of modern American literature and a pathway towards discovering and understanding some of the alienation that was common for Gen X'ers like myself.

The anticipation of waiting for it to come in the mail was excrutiating but it was worth the wait. I must have played this hundreds of times in the last month and I am still enjoying it as much as I did the first day. This is one of those albums where every song could be a single. My two favorites are Hallelujah and That's What You Get.

This spiritual and mythological tale, in the novel of the same name, was intended to parallel the events unfolding around Sara and her father.  The point of the great legend of Lord Ram and his beloved was about how no two who love eachother can ever truly be seperated... the mystical blends seamlessly with the emotional in this lush, lovely story on film.<br />The acting is superb and the magic palpable.<br />Bravo!<br />Jai!!

B00001QEG5|2.0|How can a band who's first three albums simply kicked your teeth in when you heard them go from that to \\"Come out And play\\" & \\"Love Is For Suckers\\"? Some bands like \\"Def Leppard\\" for instance, can make the transition from a \\"Pyromania\\" to a \\"Hysteria\\" & make it work, but that wasn't the case for \\"Twisted Sister\\", They went from singing and writing songs like the rock anthems \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" & \\"I Wanna Rock\\" to bubble gum stuff like \\"Leader Of The Pack\\" & \\"Hot Love\\". One reviewer on here for instance \\"Taylor x\\" wrote that \\"Hot Love\\" is an underrated metal gem, well if this person thinks that, then he or she probably thinks that anything off the first three albums is Country & Western or whatever, go figure, I sure has heck don't see the connection. In the end, this album right after the poor \\"Come Out And Play\\" put an end to \\"Twisted Sister\\". They have gotten together in recent years and played some shows & last year they did a \\"Christmas Album\\" called a \\"Twisted Christmas\\". Most recently, \\"Rhino\\" records issued a DVD with all their videos on it which is worth having. They also did one for the band \\"Ratt\\" as well, which is also worth having.
B00003CX9S|5.0|David Lynch definitely knows how to combine unsettling images with a dynamic story.  The Elephant Man is no exception.  Quite a wonderful film.  John Merrick *played beautifully by John Hurt) is a historical fellow with a rare disease causing deformity.<br /><br />The movie, also featuring reknowned British actor Anthony Hopkins, details the events of his life.<br /><br />David Lynch, master of the unsettling, is surprisingly at home with the character of The Elephant Man.  His wonderful direction and talented cast truly make this one of the best.<br /><br />As with all Lynch DVDs, don't expect much in the way of special features.  Be thankful they're actually on DVD.<br /><br />Must See.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's funny because i bought this album after hearing \\"origin of symetry\\" and at first it didn't do \\"it\\" for me.It sat on my shelf for 2 years and just last year while waiting for a ride i decided to pop it in again and see what all the fuss over this album was.The song that first hit me hard was \\"stockholm syndrome\\".So as i'm waitng on my ride I continued to listen to the album and was hooked!!!My fav.song is \\"ruled by Secrecy\\".Some people may not like this song but I love the piano playing. Muse has so many sounds that you never get bored.They can be soft and angelic,pop sounding,grunge like and so much more.This is one band that I will buy their CD without listening to it.AWESOME WORK!!!
B000V8I2QU|3.0|As a die-hard Springsteen fan, I'm torn about this album.  The lyrics are as intricate and involving as usual, and we get the typical Springsteen switch-up from fast hard-rocking songs to gut-wrenching quiet songs.  But the production is so overdone that it's as if he's singing through a veil, and everything tends to sound too much alike.  There are some songs that stick in my head - Radio Nowhere, Long Walk Home, Devil's Arcade - but other songs that reviewers mention (Girls in their Summer Dresses) do nothing for me.  If we get a concert album out of the current tour more songs may turn out to be appealing, but if you're looking for a great, consistently enjoyable recent Springsteen album, buy the Dublin Live set.
B00005JMK0|5.0|It is downright depressing knowing that this movie is almost impossible to find anywhere on any format unless you are willing to dish out over $50 or buy an illegitimate copy from some vendor who really should not be trusted.  I've been looking for years at every local used VHS store for a copy of this movie, but never saw one.  I've asked small town VHS rental stores if they still have it and get mostly confused looks or a simple \\"no\\".<br /><br />What irks me is that the movie exists in the hands of either Sony or Turner Entertainment Company, Inc., yet they have not put any priority on finding it and getting it to DVD or at least allowed for download.  I read a story at Internet Movie DataBase (online IMDB) that a very active fan called MGM inquiring about the movie's release and they responded with a \\"it doesn't exist\\", how sad is that!?  I know that America is very capitalistic and the only way large companies listen is when a relatively large profitable company such as Amazon receives vast numbers of interested customers in a specific product in the form of reviews, wish list adds, and \\"alert me\\" ticks.<br /><br />Basically if you came here expecting to buy the DVD and see that it is not available, please do yourself and everyone else here a favor and add yourself to the \\"alert me\\" group.  The higher the number of people showing interest will result in a higher chance the DVD will be focused on being released.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, its a gem with excellent music and nostalgic properties for people my age.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I watched this show after a lot of people told me about it. I had cable so I watched it OnDemand. I told my mother about it who doesn't have cable. Her birthday was coming up so I thought it would be the perfect gift for her.  She loves it! She has watched two episodes a night.  You will be surprised by a lot that happens in this show. It's a tasteful show so don't think that you can't watch it if you don't like bloody shows. You can watch this!  It's an awesome and you will come to really like Dexter.
B000UJCALI|5.0|This movie came out when I was 10, and I remember seeing the trailer for it on TV one night and seeing Jack running through the snow with the AXE and it was One of the scariest things I had ever seen. NOT long after,  I seen the film and thought it was GREAT, it was also my first introduction to Jack Nicholson. I don't think ANYONE could have played \\"Jack Torrance\\" better than Jack, It's been said that Jack's performance took away from the main character (The Hotel) but that is rediculous....Nicholson MADE this movie what it is. He goes from being a normal \\"Hard on his luck\\" type of guy, and you see him being pushed to the point of madness. I liked how his look as time went on began to change. There are SO MANY classic parts in this movie, like the part as Danny and Wendy are out playing in the snow and we see Jack just standing there in a trance, THAT is SCARY, almost bothersome., The part where Wendy tells Jack they need to leave the hotel after Jack just encountered the crazy lady in 237, He goes from calm to boiling hot in 2 seconds. The infamous confrontation Wendy and Jack have while she's holding the bat walking backwards, and how about when she locks Jack in the food storage??? His performance is SO good (\\"Go check it out....\\") This movie made me a huge Jack Nicholson fan and I love all his movies but THIS one in particular stands as his absolute BEST, at least for me. NOT really sure how there can be ANY negative reviews.....I've seen this movie litterally over 50 times and everytime it is like watching for the first time, I LOVE IT!!! Have to give a hats off to Shelly Duvall as Wendy, she comes across as so believeable and you begin to feel sorry for her and what she is going thru. All in ALL, I am esstatic over the 2 disc special edition this movie is getting, I bought the last one as well from a few years ago, and I'll buy the 30th aniversary and the 35th and so on. I would recommend this to ALL
B000RZIGZ4|5.0|Wow. I had not seen this movie since the 90's. This HD DVD version almost makes it seem like a new movie. The Sound is awesome, the picture crisp for the most part. I was very pleaseantly surprised. It still has some of those lame, laughable moments, weird clothing typical of the 80's, and Tom Cruise's abnormally large buck teeth but all in all very enjoyable. If you love this movie buy it HD DVD!
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|While I have always liked Led Zeppelin I feel like I have grown up with Robert Plant.  What I mean is that since Led Zeppelin his music has grown, evolved and matured.  Thru' with the Two Step is my favorite song on the album.  This is such a great song.  Plant's vocals combined with a two step beat and great guitar sound. Horizontal Departure is another great song.  This song pairs Plant's strong vocals up with some great guitar jamming.  I don't see a big difference between the original album and this new Remastered version, but I'm not an audio expert.  There are several other good songs on the album including Other Arms, In the Mood and Big Log.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|First of all, let me start by saying that it would be impossible not to compare Serj Tankian with System of a Down. He is one of the main voices of the band afterall. There is a very System of a Down vibe here. Although this album is much more serious and much less eclectic, it can still be very powerful. Serj is indeed a very talented musician; a great vocalist as well as multi-instrumentalist, and he really shines here. Such tracks as \\"Feed Us\\" show off a very powerful vocal range. Most of the songs are pretty short, yet contain breakdowns which really add to an epic feel of the album. Overall, Elect the Dead is very melodic in nature, and is much less heavy than System of a down. Many of the songs contain a weird, hollowed-out sounding piano, as that could be found in an old horror movie. The album is dark, and very politically, charged, something that Serj is famous for. Although mostly serious, there are a few moments of practical humor, such as the song \\"Lie lie lie\\" which starts off with a tiny piano intro followed by a chant \\"La la la la la la la la lie lie lie\\" and then Serj sings about jumping off a cliff with a lover. Somewhere along the lines we hear a woman's screams.<br />  While not quite as well-excecuted as a System of a Down album, I simply must give Serj props for writing, producing, and recording this album almost entirely by himself. It really shows that Serj is truly a genious, and definelty contributes to System. Elect the dead is a very solid, and sometimes unconventional rock album that any rock fan could learn to love.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I was excited to hear this album because everything that LP had done had been extremely good and I had been waiting so long for their next album.  Now, I'm not a narrow minded music lover.  I love all types of music (except country) and I have no problem when a band I like tries a new sound or something.  I respect that.  But this album was absolute garbage.  They sounded nothing like the previous albums and, more importantly, they sounded nothing like an interesting band. The songs were bland and without feeling or heart.  Perhaps they interest the casual rock fan, just looking for a guitar riff and a screamed verb or two, but to a LP fan and a true fan of the genre, this album was an insult to my intelligence and love for rock.  It sounded like they wrote each song in between rest stop breaks while traveling on the road.  The lyrics were thoughtless, the guitar parts were bland, and everything all together was just disappointing.  Mediocre ballad after mediocre ballad appears on this album and for some reason they felt it necessary to kick Mike Shinoda to the curb for this album.  Why?   The reason why they're such a great and complete band is because they're a rock-metal band and they use their unique sound in their songs.  I'm not sure what led to this album, but I hope that the \\"remix\\" album of this brings closure to the LP fans that expected a lot more from this band.
0141301120|1.0|Because my children dearly loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I could not have been more delighted to find a sequel.  I bought it as soon as I discovered it, and proceded to read it to my daughter.  My son then proceded to read the book himself.      As I read it to my daughter, we were both very disappointed.  We had hoped to discover what happened as Charlie learned about running the Chocolate factory and ultimately how he took over.  Instead, we found some sort of a creepy science fiction type of story, complete with very frightening aliens.  Neither one of us enjoyed the book very much.    My son read the book and had nightmares about the aliens for months afterwards.  He wrote a book report on it and stated that he did not like the book in his report.  (I wonder why?)    While I certainly recommend the first book, I cannot recommend this one at all.  It isn't fun to read and just isn't the kind of story most of us are looking for after Charlie won his factory.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Clarkson's third CD was deemed \\"controversial\\" by her record label and thought to be too dark and somber for commercial success. Well, while it may not be the type of record that easily pushes songs onto the Billboard Top 40, it is a very, very good showcase for Clarkson's voice and developing skills as a songwriter.  I admire Clarkson for placing her artistic vision and integrity ahead of sales, and feel that over time, music fans and critics alike will simply listen to the music, and her vocals, and consider this album nothing short of a success.  My favorite moments on this CD are those where she is stretching to find her musical direction, in cuts like Never Again, Sober, Maybe, Irvine and in the excellent hidden gem, Chivas.  While this CD may not appeal to the masses who are fed their music through Top 40 radio airplay, it reminds me more of the rock-oriented CD's of the 70's and 80's that yielded few (if any)hit singles.  Clarkson may lose a bit of her American Idol and Breakaway audience with this CD, but in return she will gain the respect of those who like their music more honest and personal.  This is an excellent CD,and it becomes even moreso with additional spins.  Clarkson's voice is   amazing, conveying nuance and emotion when needed, and hitting the highs that set her apart from all the other female contemporaries.  She is a true talent.  Buy this record!
6301797906|5.0|When John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in 1962, special mention was given to this novel:\\"the great work\\",  it was labeled. I still prefer the book, but director Ford came very close to emulating the book's pain.If the film itself is dated after 67 years, the American spirit of greed in many is alive and well, thank you. Fonda's anger over basic economic inequality may be more subdued today, but it's certainly more widespread.Bill Moyers reported 6 months ago in \\"The Nation\\" that the top 1% of American wealth equaled the wealth of the bottom 90%. But, just as long as there too many people like Mother Joad, seeing hope of better days,then economic inequalities will only worsen. One is never again likely to see peaches being picked at 2.5 cents a basket. One, however, is likely to see an economic revolution at some point unless the greedy are forced, forced,as Fonda asserted to give up their ways. As veteran NBC newsman John Chancellor said shortly before his death (paraphrasing): \\"I live in a world today that I don't know and don't understand and therefore don't like very much\\".However you view the world, please view this classic American film.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I thought this would be a \\"feel good\\" movie, but really it's a \\"feel bad\\" movie until the end.  What this man went through to keep his commitment to be there for his son was painful to watch, especially because the movie is based on a true story.<br /><br />I think others have described this film more than adequately, so I'll just try to add a few points here beyond the obvious inspirational quality of the movie.<br /><br />First, the bonus features really are bonuses.  The \\"making of\\" documentary is a \\"must see\\" after you've watched the movie.  The mini documentary on the Rubics Cube is great too!<br /><br />Second, something some may not notice that I did was the painstaking attention to detail in reproducing the early 1980's.  (This was mentioned in the \\"making of\\" documentary)  When we see scenes taken outside where there is a lot of traffic, I saw many cars but not one that was after 1981.  All the appliances, electronic devices, and other set decorations took me right back to about 1980.  Quite amazing.  Way more work went into this movie that you'd expect.<br /><br />This movie shows what the opposite of cynicism looks like.  And, it gave me something to really think about.  Maybe it's the persuit of \\"happyness\\" that makes life worthwhile, as much or more than being \\"happy\\".<br /><br />Finally, I very much appreciated the fact that the story was ethnically neutral, for lack of a better term.  What I mean is that the situation Chris Gardner found himself in could have happened to anyone regardless of background.  He was essentially a gifted person who made a bad business decision and soon found himself in a desparate situation.  He found some happy people (stock brokers) and decided to persue that happiness, and against the odds he succeeded.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|I've heard the cast is really good! So the movie will be outstanding  too.
B00003CX9W|5.0|What a gem! The best Disney ever made.  A perfect blend of classical music and disney animation.  Wonderful for all ages.  It was my favourite film as a child, and now it is my daughters favourite too, hopefully it will be her childrens also.  Timeless classic.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|All I can say is that Ratatouille was a great movie. Pixar is on a roll. Definately one of the best movies of 2007. I am part of the Disney Movie Club and I cant' wait for them to make this one of their Featured Titles.
B0002FR07O|5.0|I had never heard of porcupine tree, but now I've been speared upon their spiny leaves of musical exploration. I've been searching an finally found a band that is different. This album comes off as a voyage. Progressive rock evolved from the days of Yes and Rennaissance. Their is a lot of nice variation in the voyage as we go from balledesque type stuff to a hard rocking sound to a few folksie places. Lots of good sound effects and experimentation inbetween. This is a very talented outfit. I'm enriched to have finally discovered them. If you don't know them, you should really check this one out.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Disney Brings us another great super classic straight out of the vault! Jungle book is a timeless tale of a young boy who finds the bare necessities of life when he meets baloo a great big lovable bear. I just purchased this movie from the Disney movie Club and I can't wait to see this classic all over again on DVD! I highly recommmend this title to anyone with kids!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|\\"...in planning a new picture we don't think of grown-ups, we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot down deep in everyone of us that maybe the world has made us forget, and that maybe our pictures can help recall.\\" --Walt Disney, when asked to explain the secret of the appeal of Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs.    It was selected as one of the first 25 films into the National Films Registry of the Library of Congress. Today we can't imagine the newness of SW&TSD at its release seventy years ago: examples such as its length as an animated feature, its use of colors (1500 tints and shades were used), its use of song to advance the story (The Wizard of Oz went forward at least in part because of SW's success), its lifelike motion of characters (Snow White's dancing with Dopey was modeled on live-action dance footage), its technological firsts such as 3-D effects in the scenery, its subtilty in depiction of the human form.    More deeply, SW&TSD does what only a great film can: it captures your imagination and emotions. You forget it's a cartoon and really believe in the story. Grumpy is won over by Snow White and so are you. Moreso, the timeless qualities of the promise of hope, the triumph of good over evil, and the transcendence of the human spirit, to paraphrase historian J. Canemaker all flow out of this treasure.    The scariest scenes might be a little much for the youngest kids, but for everyone else it's a must-see.    The 2-disc Platinum edition gives a wealth of extras, including an audio commentary almost half-full of Walt Disney's spoken comments, deleted song and scenes, a sing-a-long, a game, and much more.  Don't miss it!
B000VT6FAO|4.0|After listening to this album, I realized that Dave Gahan should have made an album a little more uplifting and retro. The first three songs on this album are the best. And I'm giving this cd 4 stars because \\"Saw Something\\" and \\"Kingdom\\" are two of the best songs that Dave Gahan or Depeche Mode have recorded in a very long time. \\"Kingdom\\" is the most commercial song on the album. And the strongest. It sounds like a song DM should have released years ago. \\"Saw Something\\" is a song I lost myself in while listening to it.     It is a gorgeous song that is beautifully sung by Dave. Just a perfect song. The rest of the songs are average.  Nothing stands out as much as these two songs. But they're that good that the cd deserves 4 stars.    As far as Dave's ability to write songs, I think his lyrics are deep but simple. I think he should contribute more songs to DM.  Martin Gore isn't as good as he used to be. He needs someone like Dave to light a fire under his a$$.
0061256447|1.0|I love the Sigma Force novels. I enjoyed [[ASIN:0061120723 Black Order CD: A Sigma Novel]] narrated by Grover Gardner who did a great job and [[ASIN:1419362984 Map of Bones, A Sigma Force Novel [UNABRIDGED] (Audiobook)]] narrated by L. J. Ganser who did an outstanding job.    L. J. Ganser brought the characters to live and I was thrilled listening to him. This book, The Judas Strain, narrated by Peter Jay Fernandez is a BIG letdown. Peter Jay Fernandez spoils listening to this new Sigma Force novel.    Better get the book.
B00005AQF7|5.0|this album is so sick. the beats are crazy and snoop's rhymes are insane.    make sure to listen to serial killa (best song on the cd)
B000002HPV|5.0|I adore Bjork.  Not only is she an amazingly beautiful and beguling woman, but she's one of the greatest musicians working today, and this is one of my favorite albums of hers.  This was the first album of hers I got, and I still play the tar out of it.  The opening song, Hunter, is filled with tension and beauty, but my favorite song has to be Joga, the 2nd track.  The chorus is so powerful and moving, and the string section gives it a really beautiful feel.  The final track, All is Full of Love, is wonderful as well.  When Bjork sings, that voice penetrates your soul.  It gets to you emotionally first, intellectually second.  She has such an aura and a magnetism to her that is undeniable.  Unfortunately, many in this country think of her in the swan dress at the Oscars (For the record, I love that dress.  She looks adorable in it).  It's easy to make fun of a real artist like her.  She's immensely popular in the rest of the world (and with good reason).  She is worth every accolade that has come her way.  She is life, love, happiness, and sadness.  She is universe...
0786891084|5.0|The whole book is in written correspondence. There are letters, emails and text messages. The book is about an Irish woman, Rosie, who makes many wrong choices in life. Before she graduates high school she gets pregnant, which makes eliminates some of her life's choices. Meanwhile, her best friend, Alex's family moves to the US, so they are separated by distance and their choices. It was a super easy read, great for reading on vacation.  It's like \\"Ally McBeal\\" meets \\"When Harry Met Sally\\". The main characters met when they were young, but didn't know they were meant to be until years later, after getting married, having children, and opening and bed and breakfast.  While we don't see what they went through, we read the funny stories of what happened on every page. She has a great way to express herself that made me want to sit in the beach chair all day long to finish.  I didn't really like that they used foul language all the way through, but most of the time it fit with the story. If I had made the same mistakes that she had throughout my life, I am sure that I would have used much worse words to describe it. I wouldn't allow my daughters to read it until they are much older.  It's a great book, as with Cecelia Ahern's other books. This one is probably my favorite of hers.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I am by no means a die-hard Bruce fan, and in fact only started to listen to him with any focus a year after Born to Run came out - I was initially repelled by the cover-of-Time, \\"the next Dylan\\" kind of baloney that was heaped on him at the time. But as the years went by, I acquired more and more appreciation for his passion and what I came to finally accept is his true persona, a man who is struggling to find meaning in a world that is unpredictable, unfair, and often brutal but who manages to find enough beauty to stave off despair and continue the search.    Having said that, I bought this album a week ago and have been playing it at least once a day all the way through, and I think this is a classic. The comments I've read here about the abysmal production completely baffle me - and I didn't even buy the commercial CD, I downloaded it from  iTunes and burned my own copy. I think the production does a fantastic job of highlighting the melodies, which are consistently beautiful and interesting, track to track. Bruce's voice has never sounded better, and the lyrics are just opaque enough to lend some mystery and bite to the proceedings.     My only quibble is that, without the printed lyric sheets, some of the words are hard to make out, and listeners trying to decipher them on their own may miss some of the more intriguing content.    I've been listening to music fervently and closely since I was nine years old, and one of the somewhat perverse pleasures I've experienced over time has been the satisfaction of seeing trivial, contrived, and pretentious recordings and performers fade away as their \\"sell-by\\" date comes and goes. And conversely, I love that teenagers are still buying Hendrix albums (not to mention Led Zeppelin and Creedence). This recording will be bought and listened to for years to come, too.

1591841666|5.0|I think it might have been my mother who told me that when I was a kid.  While the lesson may have worn off, Seth Godin tries to bring it back to life in his (very) short book \\"the dip.\\"  The \\"dip\\" in Godin's book describes the trough between when you start something and when you become the best in the world at it.  That trough is often longer than you expected, tougher than you expected, and steeper than you expected.  He claims that is why only one person is the best in the world at anything - because it's HARD!  Simple but insightful, this lesson fits neatly within well worn lessons on positioning (Ries & Trout), Crossing the Chasm (Geoff Moore) and Good to Great (Jim Collins), all of which talk about how different (and beneficial) it is to be the best in your field.<br /><br />Don't test the dip unless you are willing to work intensely at it.  Don't keep trudging down that path unless you are willing to continue to the end.  And there is no shame in quitting, if you do it before either of the above steps.<br /><br />We've all encountered the dip.  We've been unsure whether to start, continue, or quit on the way to something.  Mr. Godin gives us a bit better map to help us see which direction to head.
B000002KIE|5.0|Despite my dislike of punk music (and the scene itself, especially the American side of it), I play this album a lot.  One can discuss the reasons why punk came about, whether it's real music, whether it was hype and media BS, but when it comes down to it, all that matters is whether this album is any good.  And yes, it is.  It's great rock and roll, and it really hasn't dated like some punk albums.  It isn't a relic.  Anarchy in the U.K. is still a great rock and roll anthem, and I've always loved the song EMI for some reason.  A song trashing a record company is something you didn't hear back in The Sex Pistols' day.  I've always liked John Lydon/Rotten as a person, even though sometimes he's said things he probably shouldn't.  Steve Jones and Paul Cook are excellent here.  I wished they had kept Glenn Matlock in the band though.  It would have made life a lot easier for all of them, as Sid Vicious never played on this album, sans one song, God Save the Queen.  Jones said there were 2 bassists on it, his and Sid's.  This was the only official studio release of The Sex Pistols, but they did make a great film and soundtrack with The Great Rock and Roll Swindle.  John went on to Public Image Limited, a very good band.  But I have a feeling that he will be known for The Sex Pistols the rest of his career, which probably majorly pisses him off.
B000UR9TQO|1.0|I've been a fan since I saw them in concert in 1970. Their first four albums are classics. When this film first came out, I couldn't wait to see it in the theaters. I've only seen it once, and I thought the concert performances were HORRIBLE! So bad, in fact, I couldn't listen to LZ for a decade! Every time I heard their music, images of these god-awful performances filled my mind. I finally re-kindled my love for their music, and I never want to see this film again. If you really want the definitive dvd of this band, buy the 2 disc compilation \\"Led Zeppelin.\\" It is STUNNING from beginning to end, and shows the band in all their glory. Why they ever released these poor performances, when they had the great performances shown in \\"Led Zeppelin,\\" mystifies me.

0805079831|5.0|Perhaps you won't accept what Naomi Klein is saying in The Shock Doctrine. I'm sure her take on the reality of the American Empire is too much for many to take in. Still, if you care about your country, the world and your future, you owe it to yourself to at least give some consideration to what she has to say.<br /><br />This is not a book of mere opinion. What she says is illustrated with documented fact. And, it is scary. Not knowing will not save you or your children. Understanding, honesty with ourselves and ACTION toward the future we want rather than the future that is being foisted on us is our only hope.<br /><br />Read this book!
B00000K19E|4.0|This is a great thriller which made me to see multiple times. This is not about future and this is about the past and present of human slavery to few  who at the top, who magically induce crappy values for our suffering.
B00005JPWH|5.0|Even at 2 1/2 hours, this film does not drag or slow down at all.  It keeps you mesmerized the entire time as you watch the unfolding story of Chris McCandless, who burned his Soc. Sec. card, gave his money away, changed his name, and left West Virginia to trek across the U.S., with a life in the wilds of Alaska as his main goal.  Along the way, he meets a kindly hippie couple and a hippie girl that he might have stayed with had she been older; a lonely old man, played wonderfully by Hal Holbrook, who wants to adopt Chris; and a farmer who teaches him how to work in the fields.  Sadly, Chris's life ends when he eats a poisonous plant that he mistook for a safe one, and he starves to death inside an abandoned bus.  The one thing I wish Chris would have done was realize sooner that he needed other people and that it wasn't all about him all the time.  Also, he could have at least sent a postcard now and then to his parents and sister to let them know how he was doing.   However, this is not a flaw in the film.  It's the way things happened.   Penn does a marvelous job of directing, while Emile Hirsch ought to be nominated for his unpretentious, straightforward portrayal of Chris.  Eddie Vedder, in particular, provides excellent songs for the soundtrack, which I believe is worth purchasing.
1582701709|3.0|I saw the video of this book. I read the concept of minds power to create what one  want from other authors, but what I find it very positive is mass acceptance of this principle( through this book ) which was known to very few who misused it to control media and people. I found it to be a good remainder. If some body who is lost in the frustrations of the daily life , this is a good start
B000002AP1|5.0|What's hilarious about this album is what kind of music was on the radio when this was made, prog rock, glam rock, and teen idol pop like the Partridge Family.  Besides the possible exceptions of the New York Dolls, The Who, Neil Young, and Black Sabbath, noone was making music this vital and visceral, as the decline of Led Zeppelin had already begun.  Yet when you make someone no one is making, you are bound to either change everything or be completely ignored (The Stooges were virtually bankrupted by this album, but the punk explosion shows great music catches on eventually).      This is punk three years before the fact.  \\"Search And Destroy\\" will make your speakers bleed, and \\"You're Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\\" makes me laugh every time I hear it.  But even though those two rockers along with  \\"Raw Power\\" are my favorites on the album, Iggy can also quiet it down just as well with the hymn to hedonism \\"Gimme Danger\\".    While many claim \\"Fun House\\" is The Stooges best moment, other than \\"Down On The Street\\", \\"TV Eye\\", and \\"Loose\\", I find it to be full of overlong horn filled jam sets...once again I am not a fan of prog rock, and parts of that album seem like prog in disguise.  So \\"Raw Power\\" is my favorite Stooges moment, with the David Bowie production inspiring work closely resembling songs (Something \\"No Fun\\" from their first album wasn't even close to), and James Williamson's guitar playing is better than Ron Asheton's in every way.  But again, this is all my opinion.    While some associate 1973 as the year of \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\", I say it was the year of \\"Raw Power\\".  Maybe you disagree, maybe you don't, but I think if you played \\"Raw Power\\" in the same room as Emerson Lake and Palmer's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" or Yes' \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\", then both of those pretentious progfests would melt.  So I salute you Iggy as well as this album, for inspiring the end of prog rock and doing it broke.  Shine on you crazy Pink Floyd killin' cheetah.
1878424602|4.0|I find it interesting in his approach of daily spiritual activities which are nicely mixed with ancient indian spiritual wisdom with current scientific findings. I kept  remainders in my calendars. I surely wonder how many times I forget them to be relieved by the by this remainders . for example he talks of accepting the uncertinity of our best intented actions. This daily remainder he mentions makes me calm down in the daily battle of life of survival. Great book
B000002AGN|5.0|It seems like just yesterday....<br /><br />I was fourteen years old and I couldn't sleep. I walked into the den and turned on our 14\\" RCA color television. Imagine...I had to turn it on by hand...I flopped on the rust colored couch and lucky for me the channel was already on channel 4. Johnny Carson was on. Oh, my God, I was a HUGE Johnny Carson fan.<br /><br />Who was on tonight?<br /><br />To be honest with you, I forgot the other guests he had on that evening but I do remember that the Dave Brubeck quartet was on. Now you have to understand that I was only fourteen and at that age you really don't know your [...] from a hole in the ground. Fortunately, enough for me I grew up around a lot of music so I at least had developed a tolerance for other kinds of music besides those groups I favored; Led Zeppelin, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Buffalo Springfield, etc.<br /><br />Well, anyway, Johnny introduced them and said they were going to take the show out with the classic, 'Take Five'. Okay, how many of you have ever heard a piece of music for the first time and KNEW that it wasn't just a piece of music, but it was actually a piece of your soul?<br /><br />That night changed me. It transformed me. It renewed me. It baptized me in jazz' Holy Waters and I have never ever been the same. That next day I couldn't think of anything but getting my hands on a record by Dave Brubeck so when the final bell rang at school, I was literally on the path to Mecca. I walked from school to the nearest record store undeterred in my focus to return home with a Dave Brubeck album.<br /><br />I got home late that evening...like around 5PM or so...my dad bellowed out, \\"Where have you been, young man?\\" No response. I just had to get the cellophane off that record and play it on the Realistic Stero that was next to the television of destiny. My dad followed me into the room. \\"John, I said where have you-------\\"<br /><br />The music kicked in.<br /><br />\\"Oh\\", my dad's attitude immediately shifted, \\"Dave Brubeck. I like him.\\" And we sat there, my dad with a glass of wine in his hand and me with an A&W Rootbeer in our sage green Lazy-Boy recliners listening to some of the greatest music I had ever heard. It was something we could do as father and son. My dad wasn't athletic so we never really tossed around a football or baseball and he wasn't really mechanical so we never worked on household projects together, he was intellectual, an English Professor and his idea of fun was conjugating verbs, but somehow this music infected/affected both of us. It kind of acted as an \\"emotional glue\\" that held our relationship in place even when it was on shakey ground.<br /><br />I want to say that this music is incredible...and it is...but what's even more incredible is how open and receptive I was to it; how I let it change my life without any kind of resistance or force, but with a kind of \\"Prodigal Son\\" embracing. You see, it was always there...waiting for me...and when I finally turned around to notice it, it came rushing to greet me, loving me, and giving me everything it had to offer.<br /><br />I love this music. I love my dad. I love this life.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings, everyone...<br />john \\"the Light Coach\\"d with a glass of wine in his hand and me with an A&W Rootbeer in our sage green Lazy-Boy recliners listening to some of the greatest music I had ever heard.

B000VI04HK|5.0|I remember being at a party in Reno in the early eighties.  I'd heard of this new band, R.E.M. and I liked them alright.  There was this guy there who'd probably had more than his share of booze and he followed me around all night telling me these guys are \\"the next big thing.  Really, Really Big.\\"  As annoying as he was, he was certainly correct.    This album delivers like only these guys can.  I listened to this and decided that next summer's big concert with my wife will be R.E.M..  We were going to see DMB - again.  How I got so far without actually seening this amazing band is beyond me.  I particularly liked their protest songs.  They aren;t full of anger and vitriol.  they just tell it like it is in.  Honest and imaginative. Now, I can't wait for their new album, rumored to be due out this spring.  I think this will be in the CD tray a long, long time.
032147404X|3.0|I'm just confirming what the previous reviewer stated.  This book is set up in a straightforward fashion and has many excellent tips, but his corny sense of humor seriously detracts from it's overall information.  He waste 1 page on average for every chapter that he writes on his jokes and teasing.  I'd probably be willing to pay the same amount of money for the same book MINUS the humor.
B00005JLCI|5.0|It finally arrived and I finally wrote my review.  I am crazy about this film; the first film adaptation of the entire play.  It is imaginatively done and transferred to DVD well.  The extras are entertaining, but sometimes overwhelming.  Still, this film is a masterpiece and if you are a fan of Shakespeare, get thee to the website and purchase this.  You will be glad you did.
B000002AGN|5.0|I heard this album back when it was released, I remember hearing it played in my second grade classroom.  The nun apparently liked jazz and this album has stuck in my mind since the late 50's, especially \\"Take Five\\".  I never heard anything like it before but then, I was only 7 years old.  I love this album and was happy to see it re mastered.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this concert. After the 'Hell Freeze's Over' concert I was hoping for a little less acoustic stuff. The audio/video quality of this concert is excellent. Song selection is great as it highlights hits from the individual careers as well as the group. Think how many times (thousands) they must have sung these songs and you can appreciate the renditions here. Don Henley's voice is fading but it gets a little better after a few songs. The addition of horns adds a fullness to their music. I find myself still with Joe Walsh as my favorite; boy, can he play guitar.  Glen Frey's 'You Belong to the City' and Henley's 'Sunset Grill' are two outstanding performances.    This DVD is worth every penny.
B0000027G6|5.0|How can anyone not love this music.  It brings back every scene of the movie.  John Barry is a genius.
B000QFCD2W|5.0|He looooooves little girls! Or is he deathly afraid of them? Fatal Portrait, Abigail, Them, Conspiracy, The Eye(two little girls), The Graveyard, Abigail 2, and this new one.    He looooves the moon! Mentions it multiple times on EVERY album except Conspiracy and They Eye. To his credit it's only mentioned in one song on House of God and one time on Abigail 2.    Oh, this is supposed to be a review though. My bad. Great release! Almost as good as Puppet Master but the story is a little week and it just doesn't sound as original as PM.    By King standards I would give it 4 stars. But to be fair I will compare him with the metal scene at large and give it 5 stars.    Long live the King! And the moon. And little girls. And spiders. And wheelchairs. And shadows. And....
B000067J1H|5.0|I blew this movie off when it first appeared, mis-construing it as a down and dirty fight movie with dubious redeeming qualities.  I was wrong.<br /><br />This week my teen-ager, who does NOT watch many DVDs, told me I had to see it, so I picked up a copy at Best Buy and by gosh and by golly, this is a philosophy movie, not a fight movie.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few scenes with blood all over, but if anything, once comes away feeling, as the director intends, that fighting is life-affirming.<br /><br />This is a movie for intelligent people who have some angst about the way things are going under the mismanagement of the \\"business as usual\\" political parties, and for those who question the \\"gerbil on a wheel\\" existence that most jobs offer.<br /><br />I found it completely absorbing and very worthwhile.
B000E5KJE8|5.0|I know my high def collection will have this title. Great pic and sound quality
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce Springsteen scores a huge GOAL with this awesome album entitled Magic. Bruce sounds great and the musicians in the band work wonders to make the music even better.<br /><br />The CD track set begins with \\"Radio Nowhere.\\" This could easily refer to the state of online radio; but it could also refer to a man's loneliness; he asks \\"is there anybody alive out there?\\" The guitars are great and with the drums they carry the bulk of the rockin' number very well. \\"Radio Nowhere\\" is an excellent beginning for this album. \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" starts with terrific electric guitars and when Bruce comes in this number takes off like a rocket! Bruce sings of a woman who leaves him for a fantasy life in which everything will go her way; he also warns her that it won't be that easy out there without him. This rock ballad is truly beautiful and I predict that you'll enjoy \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" very, very much. Great!<br /><br />\\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" has a great beat to it as Bruce sings passionately of how life isn't going to go too well for someone. The band works wonders for this melody and Bruce's excellent diction makes \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" a real hit! Moreover, \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" does an excellent job of painting a portrait of a man who just can't find the right woman for him. Is he a misfit? Perhaps his character is indeed a misfit, but he's trying his best and Bruce sings this to perfection with sensitivity and panache.<br /><br />\\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" features an excellent arrangement for the piano; and this ballad allows Bruce to sing of a man who wants to win over the woman he loves. Bruce this flawlessly as the piano and electric guitars carry the bulk of the musical arrangement. Listen for some good percussion and strings on \\"I'll Work For Your Love,\\" too. Listen also for some very special sound effects on \\"Magic;\\" Bruce delivers this with all his heart and soul.<br /><br />\\"Long Walk Home\\" sports an excellent guitar arrangement as Bruce sings of a breakup and the resulting isolation he feels after his woman leaves him. \\"Long Walk Home\\" again places Bruce's vocals squarely in the spotlight. The album ends with an untitled bonus track; this bonus track begins with the piano and when Bruce comes in he makes this sensitive number a true masterpiece about mankind and loss. Could this also refer to burying the bodies of dead soldiers who have fought overseas? Listen for some great harmonica, too, on this bonus track.<br /><br />The liner notes have great artwork and we get the lyrics to the songs except for the bonus track.<br /><br />Overall, Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band work wonders on this CD to sound just as fresh as ever. Bruce sings as well as ever; and his fans are bound to enjoy this CD. I also recommend this CD for people who like contemporary rock and pop vocals.ting isolation he feels after his woman leaves him. \\"Long Walk Home\\" again places Bruce's vocals squarely in the spotlight.

B000TX7B5U|4.0|\\"The debut solo album from the voice of System Of A Down\\"<br /><br />So the sticker on the cover states. Perhaps a subtle jab at System Of A Down guitarist Daron Malakian, who took over the majority of vocal duties on the band's last album(s), pushing the eccentric, colorful Serj Tankian to the background and leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many.<br /><br />Certainly more accessible than his last side-project, Serart, and sounding more like System Of A Down than 2005's \\"Mezmerize\\" and \\"Hypnotize\\" did, Serj's solo album will come as a welcome refreshment to many a System Of A Down fans. While the last two albums were good efforts (yours truly still rates them rather high), they were missing a certain element that originally gave System Of A Down their appeal. On \\"Elect The Dead,\\" Serj Tankian tries to capture that spirit. In all honesty, it's a pretty simple album. If you love his band and his voice, you're going to love this album. It holds up just fine next to the best System Of A Down material, with the haunting melodies and random outbursts, calling out corrupt politicians and a complacent public. Aside from the typical System-fare on rocking tracks like \\"Empty Walls\\" and \\"The Unthinking Majority,\\" Serj busts out the acoustic guitar for \\"Sky Is Over\\" and \\"Baby\\" and the piano for \\"Saving Us,\\" \\"Honking Antelope\\" and the album's epic closing track, \\"Elect The Dead.\\" Almost all the instruments are played by Serj himself, and he plays fluidly and seamlessly, almost like a real band. He gets some help on drums from Brain (of Primus/Guns N' Roses fame) and System Of A Down's John Dolmayan, but for the most part, it's just Serj producing the sounds. Not to sound redundant, as it can't be said enough, but \\"Elect The Dead\\" is definitely an album worth picking up if you love System Of A Down. It's not too far removed from that sound, and Serj manages to add a few little flourishes here and there to perk up the ears. It's good enough to be considered System-canon. Really, you can't go wrong here.wrong here.

141694740X|5.0|I cannot tell you how helpful this book was for me.So many excuses we make for the men in our lives,rather than admitting that he probably aint that interested.Funny and heartfelt at points,worth a read if you are dating,at any age.
006017322X|4.0|Just to let you know- I usually read fantasy and sci-fi books and this is nothing of the sort.<br />I was assigned to read this for school and I must say, I found it very interesting because I learned a lot about racism and life in the US during the great deppression. Historical/non-fiction book lovers should absolutely read this. Others might  want to try it out too since its an important piece of american literacy.
0452286751|3.0|Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead,\\" is a very thought provoking book, and at times, even exciting.  There's a lot of memorable philosophy here.  With that being said, it really is a good book.  For philosophy.  As fiction, however, The Fountainhead is rather bland.  If you're looking for a good story, head elsewhere.  But if thought provocation is your thing, this book is a pretty good read, despite being overly long and overly descriptive.<br /><br />Ayn Rand's novel follows Howard Roark, an architect who goes against traditional and conventional standards.  Who builds buildings for him and no one else.  Ayn Rand's ideal man.  But the story isn't just about him.  The story is also about a man named Peter Keating, everything a man should not be.  A man who builds not for his own satisfaction, but for the satisfaction of others.  It is also about a man named Ellsworth Toohey, Roark's nemesis, who is everything a man shouldn't be, but knows it.  It is also about Gail Wynand, a man who could've been.  Finally, it is about Dominique Francon, the woman who tries to defeat Roark.  All these characters are involved in Ayn Rand's novel.  The philosophy is there.  What and ideal man should be and what a man should not be.  Told through the power of architecture.  The theme is very simple: Man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.<br /><br />It really is a thought provoking book.  One that presents a lot of ideas.  With the exception of Dominique Francon, every major character has an entire story that helps to shape what Ayn Rand is trying to say about man and how he should be.  From showing us why Ellsworth Toohey is evil, to why Peter Keating isn't strong.<br /><br />However, the writing style of the book is definitely one you'll have a hard time plowing through.  Much of the writing is over descriptive.  It's almost like reading a novel out the Romanticism era.  Ayn Rand makes sure to describe every leaf on every tree.  It slows down the pacing of the book to a crawl.  And with 700 pages to plow through, a slow pace can be very daunting.<br /><br />The book is a very slow read and it's very dry.  The book is also so bogged down in philosophy that her characters don't come off as human.  All the dialog that comes from the characters doesn't sound like how any human would ever talk.  In short, these characters are not humans, they are symbols and that really makes them far less interesting to read about.  Their actions are also not human at all.  It may be because of this that the book is such a thought provoking read, though.  Despite how dry the dialog is, it's interesting because it helps the ideas of Ayn Rand's philosophy come out.  Whether you agree or not, she has presented her take on this philosophy in a fairly interesting way.<br /><br />Is The Fountainhead a good book?  Yes.  Is it thought provoking and intelligent?  Certainly.  But is it also boring and hard to get through?  The answer there is also yes.  It's a great idea put on the table.  Surely there will be plenty who absolutely love that.  However, at the same time, it's a very hard book to plow through because of its over descriptive and dry prose and characters who aren't interesting because they're symbols.  And the representation they all stand for is far too clear, especially because the publisher felt the need to stick in some of Rand's notes.<br /><br />In short, The Fountainhead is a very good book, that presents many philosophical ideas.

6305263248|2.0|First of all, I love a good (and intelligent) action thriller--and I'm a fan of John Frankenheimer.   His \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" and \\"The Train\\" are classics.    This film left me cold. The car chases were well staged, but after a while (and after 3 of them), I thought, isn't there anything more to this?  I agree with another reviewer where the Ronin references were contrived and meant to add some \\"class\\" but it didn't really work.  DeNiro was good, as usual and if he hadn't been in it, I wouldn't have cared at all.      The other thing about this film is that most of the action involved outsiders and innocents (people not involved in the plot)getting killed just because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Such carnage seems a bit cold, and also unrealistic. Such events would make international news--and when have we ever seen such events happening? Tourists in the Roman ruins, and how many in all the car chases--in major public areas (Paris, Nice)?  Just seems kind of unrealistic and pointless to me--and again, I'm a fan of action thrillers!
B000AP04L0|5.0|The movie is an A+ and the features are a B.  I didn't buy it for the features though, awesome DVD.
B000FIMG68|5.0|You have to start with season one, but you will love this show.  Lots of twists, turns and surprises.  Be warned though, you may stay up all night!
B000X9PNOG|1.0|interestingly the special version containing the 2 disks is available all over Europe including Amazon-UK. I find it interesting and disappointing that not only isn't it listed as available here in the US but that even the basic information is not included for this single disk. I hope (and assume) that this will be fixed and the special version will also be available in the US. I'm giving it 1 star not for the content from the tour but for the fact it isn't the special version and the content on the site.
B000WSJNWQ|2.0|\\"Rendition,\\" though boasting a stellar cast of great actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Meryl Streep, and Reese Witherspoon) only fitfully attains anything approaching human and thoughtful: Reese Witherspoon going off on Meryl Streep about her Egyptian born husband who Streep has sent off and out of the United States to be interrogated for alleged terrorist activity.<br />The rest of this film lumbers along, stopping only to witness grotesque scenes of torture and massacre.<br />The problem here is that director Gavin Hood (of \\"Crash\\" infamy) does not make enough of a commitment to his material for us to care about what he is presenting. The entire film feels like it is shot behind a scrim which keeps us at arms length emotionally and morally. We watch but we don't care.
B000S88JTS|5.0|We saw this for the first time in 25 years.  It's as fresh and fun as ever.  The only drawback is that, if you're not a motorcycle, you'll want to run out and buy one.  So it could be an expensive DVD!
B000URDEB0|5.0|Love this album, Anette is just as good as Tarja in my opinion. This album is the heaviest Nightwish album to date, and its awesome!
B0000X2EOW|3.0|Rather disappointing, given the glowing reviews of others.  It's far too predictable.  It's fun to see Jennifer Connolly before she became a star.  Kids liked it, but the grownups didn't.
0143038419|5.0|This is one of the funniest, and helpful books I have ever read.  The author has a way of explaining things, including depression, that is humourous, yet it helps you see it in a whole new light.  VERY VERY GREAT!
B000MRAAJM|2.0|This is a terrific DVD tour of our world, if you have a very short attention span.  The clips are too short and too disjointed, in my view.  My kids loved it.  But, they have ADHD!  I found the jumps from topic to topic irritating and dread the kids saying, \\"can we see the next disc?\\"
B0009UC81A|5.0|If you need a good fix of great music and silly adventures; inept Nazis, cowboy bar performance and a car chase scenes that rivals \\"Bullitt\\", you'll have a fun couple of hours of entertainment. The guest appearances by various musicians and actors make this movie a classic.

0471463396|2.0|The authors announce their intention to bravely go \\"beyond\\" Graham and Buffet. I found their effort extraordinarily interesting. Not because it brings new ideas from the frontiers of Value Investing; but rather because it forced me to revalidate old ones.     Written mainly by academics, the book attempts - with undeniable clarity - to provide a simple framework for valuation of a firm using Value Investment principles. First, three sources of value are defined: Asset Value; Earnings Power Value; and Value of Growth. Second, some conceptual tricks are employed to link them in a theoretical structure capable of supporting hours of animated tutorial discussion.     The importance of Asset Value in the scheme derives from the idea that if a firm that has no defenses against competitors it is worth no more, or less, than the replacement value of the assets necessary to set up a similar business.     To illustrate, imagine a defenseless firm that is worth 2x on the stockmarket while its productive assets are worth only 1x. Attracted by the absence of barriers to entry and by the high market value achievable with a substantially lower investment, enterprising businessmen set up similar businesses.    As the new capacity comes on stream the market is inundated with products of the same type and prices and profits consequently fall. The process only ends when the market value of all the firms has fallen to the value of their assets, thus eliminating the differential that attracted new market entrants in the first place.             For this to happen we must have an idealized market of perfect competition: lots of buyers and sellers, undifferentiated products, no barriers to entry, perfect information, etc. In practice, however, a dozen firms with similar assets will generate a dozen different levels of profit. And in the end, as the book admits, it is profit expectations, not assets, that determine the value of an on-going business.    I wondered if Graham and his associates ever subscribed to this concept. In my 5th edition of  \\"Security Analysis\\" I found the ambiguous comment: \\"ECONOMISTS believe that high returns on capital attract competition which ultimately forces down the rate of profit\\" (my capitalization). This same edition affirms that it is \\"The earning power of the assets in use (that) determines their investment value\\" (rather than the replacement value of these assets). I could find no evidence that the notion formed a key part of the valuation process described in the value-investing classic.     Moving on, We are told that the major difference between Earnings Power Value and Value of Growth, when used to estimate intrinsic value, is the confidence we can place on the result. It is notable, however, that both definitions of value exist in the same continuum. To calculate Earnings Power Value we can simply assume growth to be zero in the traditional Discounted Cashflow formula for estimating intrinsic value.     Beyond a certain point it is reasonable to suppose that the degree of confidence we can put on an intrinsic value calculation falls with the size of profit growth projected. How much faith would we have in a value based on a growth projection of 30% per annum, for example? But why should zero growth produce an intrinsic value closer to the truth than 5% per annum? Is one really inherently safer than the other? What about the risk of deceleration in the case of an assumption of zero growth? Conservatism does not mean ignoring reality.     Once again it all seems part of a jolly academic game. The questionable differentiation between Earnings Power Value and Value of Growth allows the authors to find a role for another element: the franchise - the defenses the firm possesses against competition. They thus arrive at a tidy little conceptual framework. If a firm has no franchise then its intrinsic value is represented by its Asset Value. If the franchise is weak then we base our estimate on its Earnings Power Value. And if it has a rock-solid franchise we might just be able to introduce the Value of  Growth. Does all this have any useful meaning in the real world?     Aside from these conceptual questions I found the book exceptionally practical in describing the details of how to value the assets and evaluate the franchise of a firm. On the other hand I found the profiles of eight value investors rather tedious.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is of course the lifters bible. Can't say anything bad about it. Just like The Dirty Dozen or Mad Max, if you catch it on TV you are required by man law to finish watching it. Extras are nice, sort of a where are they now. Got tired of renting it from library so I bought my own copy.
0753820250|3.0|After reading The Shadow of the Wind, I was left with somewhat mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is such a beautifully written book, and is in essence an ode to literature. On the other hand, there are some serious flaws which distracts from the whole experience.<br /><br />The best thing about the book, in my opinion, is Zafon's skill in artistic writing. It reminds me of why I love to read in the first place, and makes me wish I could write as beautiful as this. The book contains lots of memorable quotes as well, definitely a good thing as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />So after about 50 pages in, I was ready to love this book as I seldom loved another book before. But as the story progressed, that resolution started to diminish slowly but surely. Ironically, one the more obvious flaws is Zafon's overuse of stylistic writing. It seems like everyone acts or talks in a very elaborate manner, even in the simplest of situations, and this can really become tiresome after a while.<br /><br />The plot also isn't as ingenious as the hype would make you believe. Zafon does a good job creating a sense of mystery early on, and there are obvious parallels between the main character Daniel Sempere, and Julian Carax, the writer whose past he is trying to uncover. But ultimately, the stories of Daniel and Julian are seperate ones, and they just happen to interconnect with one another more by chance than by design.<br /><br />By far the most troublesome flaw is the way the mysteries are \\"resolved\\". All too often, answers are given by having some side character or another tell his or her story for pages. Nowhere is this more evident than at the end of the book, where literally every single detail is revealed in the form of a (very) long letter, even details which the writer of the letter never could have known, since she wasn't even involved in those events. It's as if Zafon did not have a clue or the motivation to write a logical conclusion, and decided to just dump all the information in one place.<br /><br />With a bit more attention to actual plot and character development, this could have been one of my favourite books. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed reading the Shadow of the Wind. It's just a shame that it falls some way short of its potential.With a bit more attention to actual plot and character development, this could have been one of my favourite books.

B000JRYOPG|4.0|People scoring this movie with only a couple stars and complaining that it is derivative of other movies are missing the point. There is no pretension that this movie is something original and new. The point is to examine the life of Jamaican shottas, which this movie does well.    The quality of the acting is a pleasant surprise. Some of the main characters had no previous acting experience and do an admirable job. Louie Rankin, in particular, delivers a tremendous performance and is perfectly cast. Spragga also is excellent in the film. Although Ky-mani Marley gives a decent performance, there is something about the way he portrays his character that does not feel quite right. Hopefully in the sequel this aspect will be addressed.    The soundtrack is essentially flawless. The selection of songs and the soundtrack, done by Stephen Marley, fit into the movie well.    I would like to commend the director of Shottas, who also happens to be the writer of the story. The film is pieced together well, has the correct ambience from scene to scene, and is paced nicely in a way that does not get boring. There is also a fun addition of a little bit of comic relief from time to time that is placed well.    Shottas is by no means a masterpiece, but it is highly entertaining. There are few films that I watch multiple times. Shottas is one of those few films that I watch over and over. If you want to see a solid action film with pounding reggae and a Jamaican backdrop then Shottas is for you.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|Another wonderful recording by the team of Stacey Kent and Jim Tomlinson. While this CD departs a bit from the material she is so well known for -- reintroducing the standards to today's audience, with a touch of melodic jazz underlying the music -- the character of her originals and covers of more modern tunes remains true to form. Don't miss this one.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album takes the longtime Springsteen fan back to basics, at the very least to 1984 (if not farther).  It erases the subpar 90s Springsteen catalog in under 50 minutes.  How does it do it?  With less trickery than you'd think:  earnest singing and forthright playing (Max's drums are superior).  Not a single song to fast forward.  That's why this guy is still the Boss: what other band has stepped up to take the title from him?

0375847227|1.0|The first book was a great adventure, but in the next two books, Pullman digresses into blatant church and Christianity bashing. He fully endorses eastern mysticism in his story and explains how the God of the Bible is an evil and spiteful being. Pullman's moral compass is way off as he clumsily closes his trilogy with loose ends, contrivances, and actually saves all of creation with some creepy prepubescent sexuality.<br /><br />It is unbelievable to me that these books got so much accliam and support as children's literature. I was looking for good fantasy and what I got was a disappointing blend of other great works.
0385474547|5.0|This book is an excellent read. I had to read this entire book as an class assignment for my English 102 and loved it. Loved it so much that I am now reading the next novel by Achebe for pleasure. I also plan to read all of his books in order of publication.  \\"Things Fall Apart\\"  really enlightened my awareness of this culture. Achebe is a great story teller. Who would have thought that a simple class assignment would turn into such an area of interest.

038572179X|2.0|So the first 70 pages took forever to get through.  It started picking up, but I didn't think the wordiness was worth the effort and didn't help the plot.  The writing was beautiful, but beautiful writing that doesn't help advance the plot?  What's the point?  McEwan describes so much, so much that doesn't matter!!!!  I thought this book was mostly boring, and had a very self important feel to it.
B0000024W3|5.0|I'm sure this is going to stir debate, since he has so many incredible works, but IMHO, this is his best.  A blend of old, Bobby, new Bobby and coming Bobby.  \\"All the Tired Horses\\" has rattled around in my brain for 20 years.  There is not one song on this album that is not platinum quality.  The title alone should tell you what Bob thought of the work.  Whether you agree that it is the best or not, enjoy!
0380789035|4.0|I'm actually not sure what to say.  The central premise that the new gods were coming to drive out the old gods seemed very intriguing, and there were certainly some interesting characters along the way.  But the way things resolve with Shadow bing the son of Odin and stopping the war feels contrived.  The dead wife feels like a Deus Ex Machina at times, and the prologue doesn't seem to fit.  But excellently written - 600 pages rarely go by this fast.
0143038419|4.0|This book found me.  I was going throught he same emotional distress, I didn't however have the opportunity to take off life for a year, but many thoughts and cicumstances rang familiar.  Makes you believe in recovery.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Well, I saw this movie in VHS and kind of forgot for a long time.    Then finally I bought this DVD.    The sound was good, and the image was almost perfect.]    And most of all, I felt like re-discover a nice film.    I never liked Sharon Stone since this movie. She didn't act to look just pretty. She was not afraid to look horrible. She really tried to act nice according the her charactor.     It was a good discovery for me to watch this DVD again and own as well.
B0000067L2|4.0|Cream's \\"Disraeli Gears\\" is one of their best studio efforts and encompasses various genres of music, with the most notable blues/rock effort on the CD being their superhit, \\"Sunshine of Your Love.\\"  Among other hits are, \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"Tales of Braves Ulysses,\\" and \\"Outside Woman Blues.\\"  This CD is one of the first at the time considerations of what then was acid-rock, and engenders the time when the group of Clapton, Bruce, and Baker were crossing the Atlantic to America, and introducing the States to a new kind of blues/rock.<br /><br />Cream by and large was overwhelmed with their success and subtly parodied the news media for following them so closely on their meteoric ride to fame.<br /><br />At the time, the late 1960's generation was changing the attitudes of the previous conservative one, and the colorful cover art on the album was characteristic of the hippie culture with its vision-inducing electric neon artwork.<br /><br />The songs of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" shows a marked shift in the context of lyrics, becoming more creatively different, taking everyday situations in the case of \\"Outside Woman Blues\\" and relating it to the problems of non-monogamous relationships.  In other songs, the obvious departure from reality is apparent, relating to history in the case of \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\"; alcohol-related creative surges with respect to \\"Strange Brew\\"; the obvious discontent of the generation with \\"We're Going Wrong\\".  Not to leave the listener in a bad mood, the last song, \\"Mother's Lament\\", is a humorous poke at bathtime with the children, and a cautionary tale to boot.<br /><br />I have rated this album at 4 stars because for the time, \\"Disraeli Gears\\" was ground-breaking material.  By today's standards, however, I think other less generous listeners of this generation would barely rate this album at 2 stars.  One must remember that as ground-breaking material goes, this album was one of the first new works that heralded the '60s generation of music, among Hendrix, the Beatles, and other groups that ushered the world into a new wave of beliefs and attitudes, as a way of telling the previous generation they didn't want the Vietnam War; that they were adopting new social responsibilities that snubbed the conservatives.  Although \\"Disraeli Gears\\" does not take a political stance by addressing social concerns other than \\"We're Going Wrong\\", this album is only the beginning of the peace movement in which other artists take a more direct look at world conditions and offer their views through their music.<br /><br />If you are a listener new to Clapton, listen first to \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" and hear the guitar solo.  You'll understand Clapton's notable use of pentatonic scales as he weaves blues notes and passing tones into a rock context.  This song is the most recognized of Cream's songs, with the exception of \\"Badge\\", which does not appear on this album.  As a guitarist myself, I certainly appreciate Clapton's influence on countless others who have begun learning by listening to Eric, and only beginning to understand his intricate methods of technique and feel.<br /><br />This album is a must-have for any true rock collection, because of its significance in history, and the music that began to change the world.other groups that ushered the world into a new wave of beliefs and attitudes, as a way of telling the previous generation they didn't want the Vietnam War; that they were adopting new social responsibilities that snubbed the conservatives.

B000LC4ZF8|3.0|Well, it was great to have extended version of the legendary classic-wanna call it a classic.     But I felt a little sad knowing the fact that it's still 2 channel only.    Actually there's not many scenes that I am dying to see in 5.1 or even 6.1 channel since this is not like Star Wars, but still it's DVD.

B000063UR2|5.0|This is the review for the Legend (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] and I have to say it is a great piece of work Ridley have done at last.  The picture and sound quality is just perfect. It is as if shot yesterday with HD camera, the most recent one. No grainny, with the most picture sharp, the most beautiful as it can have.  To begin with, I urge you not to watch the theatrical release version which is 1 hour and 30 minutes version with Tangerine Dream soundtrack. I am not saying that Tangerine Dream is a bad artist but Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack is much better and it fits perfect with the movie. And plus the director's cut which is 114 minutes long makes more sense in many ways. It is the perfect film itself. On the other hand, the theatrical release version has so many problem not just because it is a shorter version but it has other problems such as the moment when the evil king's first appearence. Ridley wanted him to appear him way later but in the theater release version, he appears at the beginning and that makes the movie's tenstion away.  Ok, the main review.  Ridley Scott made three or if I may add one more, four great great visually stunning film in his life, and then he concentrates more on making boxoffice hit movies from then on. Maybe he is tired of not making popular movies anymore and he wanted to have more fame and then everything became not that exciting anymore. The lists are &#60;BLADRUNNER&#62;&#60;BLACK RAIN&#62;&#60;LEGEND&#62; and if I may add one more that will be &#60;SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME&#62;.. Among them this one is the most  stunning beautiful eye blindingly shot film ever made. He used the nature so well that it almost look like we are in the totally different world somewher like heaven or somewhere not even exist.   The forest always has pollens flying as if they are snow or fog. So beautiful that makes us dreaming or even doped watching at the world in a totally different way, Birds flying, animals hopping, all kinds of flowers everywhere, trees,..beautiful sky and endless woods.  And most of all young Tom Cruise and angel look Mia Sara, the princess. Even one look can melt your soul girl.   Not only that. The palace where the evil king lives is a gothic like place just like the movie &#60;BLADE RUNNER&#62;.  The color pattern he used.  Blue, Red, yellow, purple and all kinds of so much vivid colors that make our eyes almost blind.  The night scenes and dark palace shots are just so great to even look at.   The all kinds of creatures that are not humans, they are not childish at all. They are totally original.  The Gump is so cute but mature at the same time, he is a true leader. A small figure but very lovely. The small angel like female figure is just lovely-sorry I don't know the name- it is like tinker bell. And all the other charactors are not like kid's stuff at all. Some very real and not childish at all. Some very scary and perfect. Tim Curry who played the darkness-the evil king was so perfect that he was almost scary for children.  The most amazing part from the movie was when the good team creates the light beam by reflects with a bunch of iron plates and destroy the evil deeds. The beem was blue and was so beautiful.  The Jerry Goldsmith's music was just perfectly fits with the beautiful movie which was not shown for the movie first released in the theater version and Ridley himself was not all pleased.   I again urge you not to watch the Theatrical version.   All in all. This is one of the best Ridley Scott ever made and I would say the best fairy tale movie in history. You cannot miss this one.  It is a bliss that now it is released in bluray in a perfect condition. The Ultimate Edition has both Director's Cut and Theatricla Cut and both are pitcure, Sound perfect. But as I said don't waste your time watching the Theatrical version.  The end.  WHERE TO FIND:  Both selling from Amazon US and UK the price is almost the same. But since Amazon Uk is selling the US version I preferbuying from US. Korea is out of order for this product. It is sad.  ART: 98/100  BOXOFFICE/FUN: 95/100  MUSIC: 95/ 100  ACTING: 98/ 100  EDITING: 98/100  DIRECTING: 98/100  SEXUALITY: na/100  ACTION: 85 /100  BLOOD/GORE: 70/ 100

B000053VAZ|5.0|I've been a Johnny Depp fan for years.  This movie (how did I miss it when it was new?) simply reinforces my admiration for his craft.<br /><br />As Sam, a strange, sweet, quirky man with a mild form of mental handicap, Depp performs a Buster Keaton routine with stunning grace as he entertains a crowd in the park.  This routine alone makes the film worth watching.<br /><br />But add to this sight gags (for example, Depp mashing potatoes with a racket or steaming a grilled cheese sandwich with an iron) that cause giggles and moments of sweetness that touch your heart without being cloying. . . and you've got a movie that is truly entertaining.<br /><br />After so many poor movies, Benny and Joon was a refreshing change. My copy will be shelved in my permanent collection.<br /><br />Five stars!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|The first 6 episodes were weak I admit, but the final 16 regain that magic that makes this show the hit it is. I still think this show is highly underrated. If dumb shows like American Idol can get viewers than this show should get 100 times as many. However you do have to have an IQ over 120 to really understand most of the show which is why I think so many people choose to watch dumb programming. The episodes leading to the season finale are some of the best ever!!! You will be in for the shock of your life!!!
6305949980|5.0|This movie is fantastic on every level from the story to the visual effects.  But the MUSIC is EXTRAORDINARY.  Danny Elfman is just a genius he wrote the music which is a full musical and does the voice of the lead incredibly as well as some of the other voices.  This is a classic and should be added to your library.
B00005JKJA|4.0|My first experience to the mind and films that are David Lynch was Lost Highway which personally was just a mess and not only did I not understand it, but it didn't even hold my interest and looking back, I can't remember a thing about it. However, like a lot of times, you just feel like watching a specific movie and for some reason, that was Mulholland Drive so I thought \\"eh, why not?\\" so I decided to check it out and while I had to look up what the hell happened and have people explain it to me, I was still hooked into the story and it didn't feel its length or felt confusing for the sake of it.     Keep in mind, this is Lynch stuff so take these with a grain of salt. But anyway, the film opens with an unnamed actress getting into a car wreck on Mulholland Drive in Hollywood. Dazed, she wonders into town and sneaks into a house where aspiring actress Betty is staying. The 2 meet and Bette tries to help the woman, who calls herself Rita, get her memory back. Meanwhile, a film director named Adam Kesher is getting pushed to cast an actress, Camilla Rhodes, into the film and they're incredibly adamant. The film is evidence that things aren't always what they seem and it's the case with the story as well.    David Lynch is the kind of film director where you can't tell if he's just confusing by accident thanks to movie making ineptitude, whether he's a skilled storyteller who likes to skew things just a tad or he's just pretentious and writes as if no one can understand his stuff unless you're him. While the latter was what I felt about Lost Highway, this film feels a bit more confident in its storytelling and despite its strangeness, seems more easier to follow. Of course there's also Lynch's habit of not explaining at all any of his films so any \\"interpretations\\" are strictly widely-accepted so people can have different views on what the film really means.    What makes the film a joy to watch is the acting with Naomi Watts and Laura Harring providing most of the legwork and they're just as superb. My only gripe is Justin Theroux who I can't really peg as a character and he doesn't really feel as in-depth as Betty and Rita feel. Not only that but several characters are introduced and disappear just as quickly so even though they're meant to make a certain feeling, you can't help but be annoyed some characters get dropped from the story entirely.    While I can understand Lynch's tendency to skip commentaries or making-of's, it'd be fine if it had chapter stops since you don't want to re-watch 2 and a half hours if you have classes to go to when you're at the 2nd hour mark and start over. But other than that, Mulholland Drive is the kind of film where it's really a love it or hate it but for me, I kinda love it...somehow.
1932100660|5.0|I was stunned that a book with so many scientific studies in it could be as riveting as this one is.  It is very readable for the lay person.  If you didn't want to be vegan before, you will now!  This has changed the way we eat at our house.  We are losing weight and we are finding recipes that are much more flavorful than the same old meat and potatoes.    This is a book everyone needs to read!
B00006EXDM|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this, folks. Probably the best\\" Greatest Hits\\" package in Rock & Roll history. Call me retro, stuck in the past, whatever you want to label me, I consider myself fortunate to have been around during the years this music first came out. Rock was seldom this good   again.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|At first I didn't want to buy the movie because 1) I thought Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror was much better, both in terms of action and the homage to the old grindhouse films, and 2) I was one of the people who wanted to boycott the DVD until it was release together with Planet Terror. However, I had a Best Buy giftcard, so I figured what the hell and bought it.  The movie itself is actually better than I remember it (maybe because, after watching one 2-hour movie late at night, you're about ready to fall asleep :) The car chase sequence is amazing. Though it's not up there with Bullitt or Vanishing Point, it's good enough, and it's still better than the computer-generated crap put out now. Also, a lot of the dialogue is more interesting and funnier than I remember (although anyone wanting to hear classic Tarantino dialogue (philosophical, vulgar, and funny at the same time) needs to watch Pulp Fiction). Overall, I would give the movie itself 4 out of 5 stars.  However, the only thing the DVD does right is including the lap dance scene that was omitted from the theater. That's about it. The previews are gone (you can't even watch them in the Special Features menu), and there's not a whole lot else added to the movie despite the claim on the box. Based on losing the awesome previews alone (WTF, Quentin!), the DVD is a 1 out of 5 stars. Hopefully Robert Rodriguez included his previews in Planet Terror.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Maybe it's Richard Armitage's turn as John Thornton in all his broody brilliance, maybe it's the amazing cinematography, but I adore this movie.  Despite the fact that it's four hours long, I've already seen it multiple times and have recommended it to numerous friends.  Although it can be a bit slow at times, the romance builds in an appropriately slow and deliberate manner, making it much more believable than many non-costume dramas I've seen.  Beautiful, heartbreaking and absolutely lushly gorgeous.

B000P12LWY|1.0|Why can't one give a zero star review? Nothing, nothing, nothing deserves even one star - ah! perhaps Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More, who manages a shred of dignity.<br /><br />Speaking of shreds, this shreds history into an unrecognizable mess of bodice shredding escapades. I am only watching this travesty as one would an accident in progress; morbid fascination trumps good sense and judgement all too often. My specialization is this period of history (over thirty five years of studying every primary and secondary source in existence), and I have yet to see an entirely accurate fictional representation - which I accept with serenity. Theatrical license is perfectly acceptable, but this is pure fantasy; I am pressed to find even one per cent accuracy. Earlier versions of Tudor sagas, such as 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Keith Michell's Henry VIII and Glenda Jackson's Elizabeth I, 'Mary, Queen of Scots', or 'A Man for All Seasons' (brilliant) capture the spirit of the personages and era, notwithstanding certain problems. A sixteenth century rock star brat pack? Replete with American idioms, furniture destroying rages and gangster behaviour?<br /><br />Why, when the historical figures were far more nuanced and compelling? When events were, for the time, earth shattering? The writers here settled for titillation and romance novel cardboard cutouts, not complex, contradictory, fascinating individuals who changed the known world.<br /><br />What lazy and sloppy writing!<br /><br />I despair. I know this is a minority opinion, but the series had a soporific effect on me. The dialogue is not intriguing, nor evocative of the period: Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons in the miniseries 'Elizabeth' spoke dialogue suggestive of Shakespeare's era; a sophisticated, scintillating treat for the ears and intellect. Historical inaccuracies can be overlooked with a sharp script and superb delivery. Here, the dialogue is modern: Henry VII described as a \\"businessman\\"? Charles Brandon casually remarking he can easily obtain a divorce? Why the modern, almost American, English? Challenge me, please, force me to think, make me savour the words, transport me to the era I love. And why so many scenes of thrashing limbs, naked bodies, and suggestions of sexual practices I cannot name here? Gratuitous, fanciful and unneccesary.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is hopelessly miscast, and plays Henry VIII as an unpleasant, sullen, brooding brat/\\"lad\\" given to tantrums and meaningless sex; too young and without a whisper of charm. A flat, one note performance lacking in dignity. The real Henry was a fascinating, complex man: sunny one minute, stormy the next (unpredictable and hence, far more dangerous), a cultured and musically gifted man, intellectual and intelligent, emotionally expressive, a force of natural charisma; large boned, over six feet tall with thinning red-blonde hair. And rather prudish and discreet - flirtatious, chivalrous, unrealistically romantic - with only two known mistresses, taken late in his first marriage. He actually loathed risqu&eacute; jokes, and furiously dismissed those who dared tell one in his presence. As his claim to the throne was tenuous, Henry VIII's behaviour was invariably dignified and commanding.<br /><br />Perhaps my greatest disappointment is how this series all too deliberately resembles \\"The Sopranos\\" (which I loved), but without depth and intelligence: unfortunately, this formula does not fit the sixteenth century.<br /><br />Anne Boleyn/Natalie Dormer? No physical resemblance (Anne Boleyn's dark eyes, high cheekbones, long neck and narrow but strong jawline), of course, but also lacking in fire, temper, culture, elegance, artistic abilities and keen intelligence; Dormer is round faced and vacuous. Katherine of Aragon/Maria Kennedy is presented as too old next to Rhys-Meyers, and again, as the dark haired Spaniard. Costume? Anachronistic (baroque/Italianate, sometimes Germanic, not at all English, with many elements much later than this era). Not a gabled hood or French hood to be found, but many ruffs; completely inaccurate. In the Chateau Vert scene, of which we have costume descriptions, women wear almost nothing: ruffs with Victorian corsets? And why is everyone beautiful in our modern sense? Perfect skin, perfect hair, perfect features, perfect makeup, perfect model thin bodies, perfect teeth. Historical personages should be rough around the physical edges.<br /><br />Lest we forget historical inaccuracies bordering on the bizarre: the Mary/Margaret amalgamation (she married and killed the King of Portugal? In what universe? Drunk, a screaming banshee, a vulgar, common fishwife?). Henry VIII's uncle murdered? Thomas Tallis in court during the 1520s, and gay? Buckingham's absurdly raucous, undignified, execution? Wolsey, a suicide? Henry Fitzroy, dead as a child? Why would they do this, particularly as some might actually construe this as reasonably true? I will not delineate any more historical errors - the list is far too long for this venue. Change all the names, and I would not recognize a single historical personage.<br /><br />\\"Your Majesty\\"? Not a term in use then; Henry VIII would have been addressed as \\"Your Grace.\\" I also noted a radiator in a bedchamber, an asphalt driveway, and a modern tape measure, and a nineteenth century carriage.<br /><br />Very, very, very curious: the brief glimpses offered of Whitehall, Hampton Court Palace and Greenwich are painstakingly accurate, presented as they appeared in the early sixteenth century. As is Anne Boleyn's signature. Mystifying. Perhaps that also warrants the single star I am forced to give.ments much later than this era).

B000TGCR38|5.0|I saw Black Book when it came out in a local theater and knew I wanted to own it.  I especially enjoyed the lengthy narration by Paul Verhoeven, explaining the connection with real events and real people, and the actual sites of the filming process.  I shared it with a friend who was a child in Amsterdam during the German occupation and he also liked it. He did comment that most people of that time were starving and the actors really looked well fed.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|Other review, and national review I read are correct - dump this producer - sounds like it was recorded through a pillow-case. Listen to Darkness, Born to Run, The River albums - distinct instruments, each enjoyable and identifiable,........then listen to this!! The entire musical production sounds completely indistinct and mushed together. Where's the saxophone? Even the vocals are muffled and muted. Too bad - just not enjoyable. Listen to the first 15 seconds of any of these songs - Badlands, Something in the Night, The Promised Land, Darkness, 10th Avenue Freeze-out, Jungleland, The Price You Pay, Fade Away, The River, ..... gosh, I could go on and on - the sax, the harmonica, Bruce's voice, the bass drum,.....Where's the soul wrenching moan of Something in the Night? The emotional reasonance of She's the One? What the heck happened here? Recordings from 20 and 30 years ago sound clearer and more distinct. I guess I'll keep listening to the classics on my MP3 player. This was very disappointing - fire the producer - get rid of the pillow cases - bring back the clarity and instrumental distinctiveness.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|At first listen, it just sounds like a complete mess and is all over the place, though bit by bit it begins to make more sense........       After: 1st listen - Widow single (edit) clicks     2-5 listens - Cygnus apart from the last 2 mins  clicks     6-10 listens - Miranda - (now I realise the true genius of it)     11-15 listens - L'Via L'viaquez -(brilliant)  15-20 listens - getting there with Cassandra Gemini but its still pretty tough    The bits such as the last 3 minutes of the widow and 2 mins of Cygnus along with various other parts of the album can only really be described as `awkward' listening.  When the later minutes of Widow were playing my Mum actually thought the CD was jamming! To be fair it does sound that way.  I do wonder what Omar and Cedric think of these parts, as they must have a reason why they are included.  Obviously no one could understand their music more than them so they must see something in these parts which make them special enough to have included them on the album.  In saying that, what I thought were 4 awkward minutes in the beginning of Miranda, I now realise that it really does act as a superb build up till the trumpets slowly come in.  The uses of the trumpets are what makes Miranda such a cold and chilling track and adds to the atmosphere of the album as a whole.    Like any good album you really can't judge it until you've listened to it a lot.  I really didn't like this album for starter especially as it is meant to be listened to in one sitting.  At 76 minutes long, I think the sheer length of it played mind tricks on me and instead of properly listening to the music, I was thinking of how long it was.  As you keep listening to it, time gradually becomes insignificant and when that stage is reached you can truly appreciate the album because it will start to make sense, so you're focusing less on the time and more on the music.      This album is to deloused as deloused is to relationship of command (At the Drive-in) because from relationship to de-loused, they really did take their music to another level and now they've managed one step further.  Whether they make the next step with their next album remains to be seen, where that step is I don't think they even know! But one thing is for sure they have the talent to be timeless.      One thing I really like about this album is the concept that it is never ending, it can just loop forever because the end of the last track Cassandra, turns into the intro for Cygnus.    This album also shows how singer Cedric really has moved away from ATDI even further because there are virtually no `shouty' bits at all.  In fact Frances shows what an amazing singer he really is.  He hits notes which most people could only dream of reaching, for example the \\"oh yeah\\" s during Cygnus or the \\"bring me to my knees towards the beginning of Cassandra.  Overall his pure and unique vocals add a great deal to the album.    However the key to this album which holds it together is not Cedric's unique vocals, Omar's exquisite guitar playing or John's mental drumming - but it's the infectious baselines which set the tone for the whole album.  While Omar, Cedric, John along with the other contributors go off into their own little worlds in the album, the base line is the constant throughout each song and brings it all together.  In particular Omar's guitar playing seems to dance round the baselines not knowing which way he's going to go next.     To explain what their album is like compared to other prog albums I'll put it in to context by using the analogy of running.  First of all I'll explain how much music in general can be related to running.  Anyone can run a mile, maybe at different times, but they can still run it.  Just like pop music, its easy to understand.  However longer runs require more training and you have to build up to it.  This is like progressive music because you need to listen to it lots in order to understand it or to appreciate it to its full potential.  To put this into context of this Mars Volta album is like a 3 hour long run.  A 3 hour long run can take many shapes and forms.  The MV album is like a mix of urban and rural landscapes.  The urban bits are the straight forward road running bits, or the parts of the albums which are the easiest to understand.  However they are still hilly sections in this part to keep it challenging.  Then there is the rural parts which are the parts are the rough trails which take longer because it is more technical.  This represent those `awkward' moments of the album.    To sum up Frances the mute is a never ending journey through a musical landscape.  A tough 3 hour long run may sound completely unthinkable to some people, but if you do the training its nothing short of brilliance........................just like Frances the Mute!
055358894X|3.0|Scott Lynch's much-heralded debut leads readers on a dashing thief tale in the best classic fantasy vein, through a vivid Renaissance-inspired fantasy city.  Locke and his companions are clever rogues who must outwit not only their marks but also the city guard, their own underworld leaders, and a new vicious underworld faction.<br /><br />The plot surges into high gear in the second act with the appearance of this new faction, which could have been introduced sooner.  The Grey King and especially his mage are so shockingly well-informed and powerful that Locke seems helpless against them.  This keeps the reader turning the pages, but it also makes Locke's eventual victory seem implausible and rushed.<br /><br />The climax abandons the clever thief scheming in favor of a super-villain plot out of a James Bond movie.  The villain's plan is far-fetched and poorly justified, Locke's response is oddly benevolent, and the other characters' reactions to him are unrealistic bordering on authorial wish-fulfillment.<br /><br />The constant interlude chapters covering Locke and Jean's boyhood distract from the exciting heist plot.  Lynch does relate them to the present story, but this material could have been shown more quickly and less disruptively in short flashbacks.  In addition, the narrative's shallow point-of-view makes the characters feel distant.  Only their most basic internal reactions and emotions are described in a point-of-view that shifts through different characters in the same scene, includes constant descriptions of the point-of-view character's own facial expressions, and artificially hides from the reader much information that the point-of-view characters obviously know.  This leaves them feeling shallow, like movie characters on a screen rather than fully internalized novel characters.<br /><br />Lynch's strengths, the vivid setting and his constant heaping of conflict onto his characters, pull the reader through this ripping thief yarn.  But _Lies_ is less than it could have been if the novel had gone deeper into both the personalities of his heroes and the justifications of his villain.

B00005JO9J|4.0|This is a good item for any Grey's Anatomy fan to keep around.  I assume many of you have begun to suffer, as I have, as the show gallops down the hill into ridiculous Soap Opera-dom.  Having these discs is a good way to remind yourself why you were ever addicted to these characters in the first place.  It brings you back to a better time when the writing seemed to have some thought put into it, it was easy to pretend that this show was going to be unique, and with only a drink or two the plots and events seemed reasonable.  It takes you back to a time when you could be proud to say \\"I'm a Grey's Anatomy fan,\\" or at least you didn't fear being outed as one.  And for those of you who don't want any misconceptions about what this show is or has become, I still suggest buying this, then going to rifftrax.com and getting the additional audio riffing from Michael J. Nelson (of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fame) for episodes 1 & 2.  It's a cheap giggle.
B00005K9QP|4.0|This is a great album for anyone who is a fan of Clapton or blues guitar music.  A nice arrangement for 1966.  A true test of time.
B000N6UERK|4.0|This is an example of a great movie on HD but I didn't notice so much of a change in Blue ray version.  If you already have the HD you don't really need to get blue ray.  This movie is a five. I gave it four stars because if you already have it in HD then you could save the money. On the other hand if you have no version at all and are looking to buy for the first time the movie is a five and I would get blue ray.
B000002OX7|4.0|This is one of my alltime favorite Who albums.  Their are classics, such as, \\"Baba O'Riley\\", \\"We Want Get Fooled Again\\", and \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" that solidify the album as a definite buy.  However, there are plenty of B-side tracks and bonus tracks that pack a punch.
B000HEZF0O|5.0|Blue ray versions of 2 and 3 are so cool.  Makes the movies much better.  MI 1 was shot so long ago you can see the change in the quality of sound and picture, so blue ray can't do anything about that.   Its still a good bundle.  I like MI3 so much better this version.  and MI1 dates it self but fans of this series which ever you favorite movie will really appreciate the blue ray package.   Well worth the change.
1400063515|4.0|This book will take you into the fascinating mind of its author. The author has devoted his life to the study of probabilities and uncertainty. A Blak Swan is the rare occurance of a highly improbable event that radically changes current circumstances. It is completely unexpected and is an event that was considered almost impossible before it happens. Examples are the 9/11/2001 attack, the stock market crash of 25% on Black Monday 1987, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. These occurances are impossible to predict from an academic view point with their theories and formulas.<br /> He also discusses how gambling in a casino or playing a board game like monoply do not represent the real world. the rules and odds of these two games of chance do not represent how the real world works with randomness and personal dynamics involved. (Casinos lose more unexpected money from uncontrollable events like people falling and hurting themselves or the Sigreid and Roy tiger attack than they pay off to winners at the tables,these losses are planned with the odds in their favor compounded with the gamblers not knowing when to quit).<br /> The book is hard to follow at times and a lot of the material was over my head and I had trouble understanding it, but the jewels of wisdom I did get out of it were well worth the effort. This book will open your eyes to a lot of facts of randomness that you have not previously considered.
B000EWBKK8|4.0|I like this movie and thought it was definitely better on Blue Ray.  Also wanted to counter the 1 star review.
1577314808|5.0|It would be hard to overestimate the value of the gift this book has to offer. The concept is so simple, and the rewards are so profound, it has transformed my life in ways I am still discovering! Coupled with other philosophical work I've done (and clearly forgotten), it has helped me move from being caught in a small box of big problems to a mountaintop from which all things are visible and possible. What more can one ask of a book?
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The Boss,what more can i say. He has always given his best. Cracking CD.  Bruce, your the Man.  Andy
B000OPOANE|4.0|For several reasons, this MVI is certainly better to have than the CD, but you'll have to get it before they sell out.    Starting with the good news first (groan), there are several excellent tunes on this latest Rush effort - Far Cry, Workin' Them Angels, The Larger Bowl, The Main Monkey Business, Malignant Narcissism, We Hold On.  These will stand the test of time (for however long that is with this band).  Spindrift sounds like Queensryche in parts, but the chorus needs more work - it's monotonous after a few listens.    We could have easily done without Faithless, whose anti-organized religion themes have been hinted at on previous albums, but never spelled out as bluntly as here.  This sounds like the song written to support the lyrics Neil felt \\"had to be expressed\\" after his long road trip following the deaths of his daughter and spouse.  \\"You can call [him] faithless\\", yet \\"[he] still cling[s] to hope\\", is paradoxic at best, intellectually void at worst.  Some things are better left unsaid.  Armor and Sword, Bravest Face and Good News First remind me of some of the songs I've forgotten from the middle section of Presto - you kind of recognize the music, but nothing's really memorable.        There are numerous extras on this release that are more than worth the extra cost and should appeal to anyone who's a potential purchaser - lossy MP3's for the non-audiophile, a 2.0 hi-rez stereo for the audiophile, a 5.1 mix for the multichannel surround enthusiast, a \\"making of\\" video (which is stellar), and several picture and ringtone download options.      The 2.0 stereo mix sounds better, sonically, than the CD, which is (like VT) mastered at too high a volume level for anything resembling natural dynamic range.  Interestingly, the CD version was mastered by Brian \\"Big Bass\\" Gardner, who is also a producer/mastering expert for quite a number of R&B/Hip Hop groups; he got his nickname from none other than Dr. Dre of Public Enemy.  I say that the 2.0 mix sounds better - this is mainly because the \\"loudness\\" of it is certainly lower than the CD, but also because of the sonic detail.  Neil's drums sound better to me in this version - for all the talk and hype around the new DW kit, you really can't hear much of a difference on the normal CD.  Here, there is the extra presence, atmosphere, and perhaps less use of compression, all of which brings them out better.      The 5.1 channel mix is interesting, but sounds slightly compressed and this type of music is perhaps a little unsuited for Dolby.  I didn't enjoy it on the first hearing, but I have subsequently come to like it more and more.  I am of the opinion that if they wanted a 5.1 mix, they should have recorded the album that way.  In this mix, they use the rear channels mainly for effect, such as occassional guitar fills; judicious, but noticeable, which I appreciated.    The rumor is that this release would be limited to 25,000 copies.
1582701709|4.0|I have read this book after \\"it found it's way to me\\". After reading a book:\\"orders from the universe\\" I have received a lot of things I have wished for. This book, the secret, explains in a very logic matter why it works. Not everybody's path is to be rich so don't think this book is going to make all your wishes come true. I would recommend this book to people who are open to spiritual growth and like to have a little guide book on positive thinking.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing \\"Punish the Monkey\\" on the radio, and not being able to get it out of my head. (WARNING: Don't listen to that song too much, or you will have it going through your head all the time! Punish the Monkey..... Punish the Monkey....) This whole CD is wonderful, you can just put it on and play it straight through and then start over again! It's that good. I've become a Mark Knopfler fan after purchasing \\"All the Roadrunning,\\" his CD with Emmylou Harris. Also an excellent CD. I  highly recommend buying them both!
B000OT6UZQ|3.0|This movie was ok and the blue ray was good but I don't think I would recommend you buy it.   You may want to see it but I would not go to the expense of buying a movie that I think I will only want to watch the one time.
0553589059|5.0|\\"Undertow,\\" the latest novel from the amazingly creative Elizabeth Bear, packs sin, redemption, virtual reality, probability and statistics, quantum physics, and Borgesian forking paths into its 332 pages. There are floating cities, intelligent amphibians, killers who want to learn to manipulate reality, and, oh yes, instant transmission of matter, but not living matter--or is there? And did I mention the clones?<br /><br />Its nominal hero, Andre, is a hired assassin who kills the best friend of his girlfriend Cricket in a contract hit. She knows it's him, but nevertheless she and her male colleague, Jean, help the ambitious Andre learn to be a \\"god botherer\\"--somebody who can manipulate probability. That's easy enough to do on this planet. What's harder to do is instill some sort of conscience in Andre. The story's plot revolves around whether he will in time acquire one.<br /><br />The author, as is her style, uses multiple povs to develop her story. We view things at different times through the eyes of Andre, Cricket, Jean, the amphibians known as ranids or \\"froggies\\" (think \\"wogs\\"), and agents of the vicious corporation that controls the planet (think the British East India Company of the 19th century).<br /><br />In lesser hands, a tale like this could easily spin out of control, but fortunately Ms. Bear doesn't let this happen, and the last quarter of the book is quite astonishing. It isn't all that much of a stretch to compare some of its passages with Joseph Conrad's.<br /><br />A must read.
0784011176|2.0|A piano as metaphor for repressed emotions  - an ingenious concept - hits more than a few discordant notes.<br /><br />This movie, with its bleak background and dissonant characters, played out like a song with no melody as the story unfolded, one disturbing chord after another.  The setting, a coastal New Zealand town in mid-Victorian era, provided an achromatic backdrop for an equally dreary film.<br /><br />I did not like this film for a few reasons, one of them being the miscasting of Harvey Keitel in the role of Baines.  His appearance in the buff did nothing to convince me otherwise.  While I did not consider his nudity repulsive, the scene struck me as having been done for the purpose of shocking the viewer. In lieu of this approach, a less flagrant, more tasteful method of conveying Baines' desire to \\"lie with\\" the woman, Ada, might have been devised.<br /><br />While the overall tenor of the film captures the essence of the screenplay on which it was based, the two main characters lack sexual chemistry on any appreciable level. This casting mismatch falls flat in its possible efforts to evoke genuine sympathy for Ada while it appears to successfully intensify the viewer's loathing of Baine's character.<br /><br />  Despite repressed emotions and unsatiated sexual appetites as the unspoken byline, the film misses that mounting sexual crescendo that begs for release and inevitably explodes in a momentous fireball of passion.  Instead, Baines and Ada hit fever pitch on the day Ada arrives, unannounced, at Baines' cottage.  After going inside, Ada looks around and does not see Baines.  Then, from behind the privacy curtain he appears, dissheveled and ill kempt.  The viewer watches as he grabs his trousers and puts them quickly on, all the while trying to assume some semblance of dignity.  In a clumsy attempt to explain the awkward predicament, Baines, distressed, tells Ada that he thinks of her all the time - indeed, he cannot eat nor sleep as a result of this preoccupation -  and, he says, he needs more. In case Ada needs clarification, Baines uses this moment to try his hand at subtlety and gestures toward his male member.<br /><br /> Ada's reaction to Baines' carnal confession is predictable.  Her demeanor, complete with the requisite frown and pursed lips, reflects a skittish stoicism that seems to incense Baines.  When he suddenly and very definitively orders Ada to leave his house, Ada appears flummoxed.  What begins as a simple directive, \\"Go,\\" escalates to an unequivocal command of, \\"Get out!\\" \\"Get out!\\"  Ada, visibly shaken, proceeds to  execute a wordless offensive maneuver onto the object of her frustration.  Baines' chest takes a frenzied pummeling that concludes with Ada inexplicably, frantically, clutching  Baines and locking lips with him in a pitiful demonstration of requited attraction.<br /><br />By the time the precious piano is chucked, like so much dead wood, into the water, I couldn't help but wonder how I could have missed the point in the film where Ada had begun to regard the piano with such enmity.<br /><br />Which is all the more reason Ada ought to have fashioned the piano into a boat and sailed away from that wretched place -  all alone and, no doubt, living happily ever after.preoccupation -  and, he says, he needs more.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|A lot of people were disappointed with Revolutions.  There just wasn't enough fighting, enough in-your-face reality bending.  Unfortunately for many people, Revolutions required you to think and to have an established amount of knowledge of many different areas: philosophy, religion, mysticism.  If you can digest the many layers being handed out to you at once, you'll find Revolutions to be highly enjoyable.
032147404X|5.0|This is a great book that both me and my husband love.  Tons of great info!
1400079179|1.0|This book was bad on two accounts: the writing and the history.<br /><br />First the writing. Yes, it's admittedly entertaining at points, but on the whole the writing's pretty lame. I don't see why people liked it so much. The characters are really shallow and Dan Brown doesn't develop them at all. Many characters are completely unnecessary or throw-away characters. Several supporting characters that the author spends a good amount of time on end up having absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book.<br /><br />The plot's rather lame too. The whole thing's just a giant chase scene on paper. This may be entertaining at first but the formula gets pretty old after awhile.<br /><br />The book is frequently preachy and it has long sections of \\"OK, now I'm going to lecture on my conspiracy theory.\\"<br /><br />Between those two factors the book really started to drag after awhile, especially towards the end. Most of the plot twists can be seen from a mile off. The book also has an overreliance on deus ex machina devices, and a lot of the story comes across as really contrived. And, of course, the author had to throw in a few random French phrases at appropriate moments to give the book that intellectual feel all conspiracy theorists strive for.<br /><br />Regarding the history Brown's endorsing, many people say \\"it's just fiction - why get so bent out of shape about it?\\" The problem is that Dan Brown claims that the history in the book is accurate, and a lot of people assume he's right. This book has a definite agenda to it and a major ax to grind with the Catholic Church and it's important to recognize what that agenda is and to think about it critically. Dan Brown is not a historian and his conclusions, or even the facts he uses to support those conclusions, should not be accepted uncritically.<br /><br />What it comes down to is you won't find much legitimate history in here. This book contains numerous serious historical errors and serious weaknesses in logic, method, and sources. Even outspoken critics of Christianity like Bart Ehrman (author of \\"Misquoting Jesus\\") acknowledge this. The premise of this book is a lame conspiracy theory based on a few discredited sources. Sorry guys, pretty much no serious scholar regards the Gnostic gospels as historically reliable in the least, but almost all of them agree that the \\"history\\" Dan Brown presents here is bogus. It is filled with incredibly sloppy errors that no real historian (or anyone who had done actual research) would've made. Here are just a few examples:<br />- One particularly humorous example was the fact that he called Venus a Greek goddess (she's Roman - I think he was thinking of Aphrodite, who's the Greek equivalent). Everyone who knows anything about the time period knows that; it seems to me that if he had really researched this as thoroughly as he claimed he would have known that too.<br />- The old saw that \\"no one believed that Jesus was God before the Council of Nicaea.\\" I see his research didn't include reading any of the Ante-Nicene Fathers. And the question at the Council of Nicaea wasn't whether or not Jesus was divine - the question was whether or not Jesus was coeternal with the Father (i.e. whether or not Jesus was a created being).<br />- He demonstrates a shocking lack of knowledge about the actual historical canonization process (i.e. how the Bible was assembled). Yes, he's right that the Bible didn't just drop down from the sky pre-assembled like a lot of people seem to think, but there was a definite historical process that he largely ignored. Most people don't know enough about the actual process to know better.<br />- He relies heavily on bad sources, including forged documents on the Priority of Scion and Gnostic gospels that most scholars regard as late and historically unreliable to name a few.<br />- Speaking of the Gnostic gospels, even if we assume that these were reliable, they don't teach anything resembling what Dan Brown claims theyteach. Far from presenting Jesus as more human than the canonical Gospels, Gnosticism taught docetism (which says that Jesus' physical body was an illusion).<br />- Many of his facts that weren't completely wrong were probably grossly exaggerated. For example, his figure that 5 million witches were burned at the stake is almost certainly highly inflated. He also tends to exaggerate the similarities between Christianity and non-Christian religions.<br />I could go on with a lot more errors, but I don't think it's necessary. Frankly, I often wondered how the guy graduated from high school. I thought it was very irresponsible of Brown to present this as legitimate history when it clearly isn't, especially given the fact that he obviously did no research. If you do read this book, please keep in mind that this is just a work of fiction and Dan Brown is not a historian. Thus, as I said before, neither his conclusions nor his facts should be accepted uncritically. This is not the work of a professional historian, nor is it an academic or even a serious work on history (I didn't find a single footnote in the whole book), and it shouldn't be treated as such.<br /><br />This book cannot be regarded as either serious history or serious literature. As a novel, it is little more than pseudo-intellectual pulp fiction attempting to promote a lame conspiracy theory. I'm not sure if he's a joker trying to see how many people he can fool or a fool himself who actually believes the nonsense he's pushing. This is not a book that will stand the test of time on either account. Overall, it was mildly entertaining but not worthwhile. I can't say I understand what people see in this book - for all the hype, it's really not that great.ical Gospels, Gnosticism taught docetism (which says that Jesus' physical body was an illusion).  - Many of his facts that weren't completely wrong were probably grossly exaggerated.

B000VI04HK|4.0|Good CD. With a few more of the more known songs adsded it could have been great. The good stuff...sound quality is excellent. You can hear each instrument and the vocals all clearly. Song selection, for me, is just OK. Not a die hard fan the newer stuff I just don't like that much. But if you know the studio versions and like them then you will probably like what is here. Of course there are the obligatory bash Bush protest songe. I have to admit, that is getting bretty boring and lets face it, not at all taking a risk. How about this...write a protest song against extremist cults, and oh say...Osama Bin Laden. Come on guys, have some guts. The DVD is typical cut to a new shot every couple of seconds and IU have to say I don't like that at all. It is how they all seem to be these days though so I guess someone likes it. Overall a good buy, but could have been better.

Oh, and my goodness, the end....the \\"point\\" of the book, the climax, oh I won't ruin it for you. I admit it, perhaps I am being \\"age-ist\\" here--- had the author been a 55 year old divorcee, perhaps a survivor of an illness or catastrophe, maybe I could have bought it.... but no, this was too much \\"Carrie Bradshaw goes Under the Tuscan Sun\\" for me... I'll take Frances Mayes anytime.

B000UK73QO|5.0|[[ASIN:B000UK73QO A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose]]    This book  in simple words gives us insights into our feelings, our thoughts and our relationships.  I especially loved the focus on the Ego helping me to understand when i succumb to selfishness instead of listening to my Higher Self so to speak.    I have read numerous books on personal growth, which most have been helpful but there are so many valuable gems in this book to help me find harmony both within myself and with others.    If you want a deep, caring relationship with another person I highly recommend this book to help you remove any kinks..

B00006JSS8|2.0|...the worst quality ever. My wife and I were shocked to find this CD that had nearly all of our very favorite songs by one of the greatest musicians ever. My wife was the first to spin it on the portable CD player the following morning. She complained that the recording was pretty bad. I chalked it up to the fact she was listening to it from a low-tech device and thought nothing of it. However, when I put in my computer to make a disc for the car, it had become abundantly clear that it was the disc, not the CD player. There is a constant hiss in the background and much of the music is sort of muffled. It just basically lacks the clarity you'd expect. Isn't it the standard to clean this stuff up before making a CD these days? It should be! I mean, if they'll clean up and remaster inferior artists (no need to name names) then why would Universal Music Company slap this dog together and throw it out there without any regard for quality? The answer of course is love of mammon. Well I think its disrespectfull of Stevie Wonder and those who enjoy great music.<br />Its hard for me to give any Stevie Wonder album only 2 stars, but hopefully this would make at least one person reconsider buying this particular CD. If it was most other artists it would have been 1 star for a coaster like this.
B000NA28IE|3.0|The highly anticipated 2006 film \\"Eragon\\" was, for most, a strong disappointment.  Based upon the first book written by the young author Christopher Paolini in 2003, \\"Eragon\\" is about a teenager named Eragon (played by Edward Speleers) in a fictional kingdom named Alagaësia.  While hunting one day, he finds what turns out to be a dragon egg.  The egg hatches revealing a young dragon inside that quickly grows into a powerful winged animal.  Named Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz), the dragon and its chosen rider, Eragon, are bound to each other for life.  Of course, someone didn't want the dragon to be born nor find a rider.  That someone is Alagaësia's evil king named Galbatorix (John Malkovich) who is assisted by an equally evil wizard named Durza (Robert Carlyle).  Once, the skies over Alagaësia had been filled with dragons and dragon-riders, including Galbatorix; but he was successful in destroying virtually all of them.  However, one dragon-rider from an earlier time had survived: Brom (Jeremy Irons), who becomes Eragon's mentor.  And, who had dropped the egg in the forest that allowed Eragon to find it?  A princess named Arya (Sienna Guillory).    Though the plot & characters sound interesting, they bear a strong resemblance to other works that predate \\"Eragon\\": namely, \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  Being a long time fan of \\"Star Wars\\" myself, one cannot help but notice the strong similarities between Eragon and Luke Skywalker, Brom and Obi-wan Kenobi, Arya and Princess Leia, Galbatorix and Emperor Palpatine, Durza and Darth Vader, as well as Murtagh (Garrett Hedlund) and Han Solo.  As Han Solo in the original 1977 \\"Star Wars\\" comes to Luke's rescue in the nick of time, so does Murtagh come to Eragon's rescue in one crucial scene.  Further, the whole dragon and magic-wielding dragon-rider past of Alagaësia is very similar to the days of the Republic in \\"Star Wars\\" that was guarded by the Force-wielding Jedi.  As for the similarities with \\"Lord ofthe Rings\\", as in J.R.R. Tolkien's classic work, the world of \\"Eragon\\" is a world of magic, sorcerers, elves, dwarves and an Elvish language.  Thus, with the release of \\"Eragon\\" in 2006 being only 1 year after \\"Star Wars III\\" was released and 3 years after the release of the last of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, one has to wonder whether \\"Eragon\\" was an attempt to cash in on the success of these previous works by using similar plot & character elements.  With an estimated budget of $100-million and an approximate net gross of $75-million four months after the film's release, \\"Eragon\\" was a box-office failure.      One more aspect to examine in \\"Eragon\\" is the film's director: Stefen Fangmeier.  A long-time special affects artist who worked on films such as \\"Terminator 2\\" (1991), \\"Hook\\" (1991), \\"Twister\\" (1996), \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (1998), \\"Galaxy Quest\\" (1999), \\"The Perfect Storm\\" (2000), and \\"Master and Commander\\" (2003), his first solo directorial work was \\"Eragon\\".  While the special effects in \\"Eragon\\" were great (like so many other dragon-based films that predate it), the story (as I have already pointed out) was nothing new.  Hence, my rating for \\"Eragon\\" is 3 out of 5 stars.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|Gilmore Girls has been one of my all time favorite shows.  I loved the witty language and banter and just the whole plot line.  However, I was upset with this season.  A lot of the fire was gone from the show and I just could never see where the show was going.  I imagine it would have been 10 times better if Amy Palladino had stayed with the show if her demands had been met.  My least favorite episode probably was the last.  After Logan proposes you hear absolutely nothing about what happened except Rory said no.  I loved those two together.  The only good thing about the whole season was that Lorelai and Luke got back together.

1594489505|5.0|Reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" opened my eyes to the suffering of women in Afghanistan. Through the stories of two women, a reader witnesses how religious fanatacism, violence, and territorial predators of all kinds--from Communists to the Taliban--affect everyone and have done so for decades, centuries, in Afghanistan. In this book, history and politics are brought down from the abstract to the daily lives of real characters who love their country and families. This novel is full of personal pathos and unfolds a history of tragedy laced with hope while offering beautiful writing that soars at times to the level of pure poetry. I could not stop reading.
006441034X|4.0|In the land of Ingary, where magic can and often does happen, Sophie is a young woman, the unlucky eldest of three. She works at the family hat shop while her sisters go off to seek their fortunes in apprenticeships--until one day, when the Witch of the Waste comes to the hat shop and curses Sophie, turning her into an old lady. Sophie leaves the hat shop and her home town, searching for the cure to her curse and for her own fortune. Her journey takes her to the moving castle of the a fire demon, an apprentice wizard, and the Wizard Howl, who steals girls's hearts. A playful, fantastic, personal book, Howl's Moving Castle is a magical adventure story about very human journeys of coming of age, discovery of identity, and love. However, as the book progresses the plot becomes increasingly complex and muddled, detracting from the book's clarity in plot and meaning; the ending is abrupt and somewhat anticlimactic. Nonetheless, the book remains a fun, swift, and meaningful read, and I do recommend it.<br /><br />This book is of course the inspiration for Miyazaki's anime film of the same name. While the two have the same concept and many similar aspects, they differ as the plot progresses, and for once the film is actually better than the book: in the book, plot lines, character inclusion, and character growth are often too complex, confusing the story and approaching major themes, characters, and interactions in insufficient depth. In other words: the book lacks the broad narrative sweeps, limited cast, and tight plot of the film, and it suffers for it. This is perhaps most obvious in Howl's character and in the relationship between Sophie and Howl. As the book's protagonist, Sophie's character growth is subtle and well-developed, evolving throughout the book through slow and natural revelation.  Unfortunately, the same natural, eventual growth does not exist elsewhere. Howl remains his vain, selfish, shallow self until the book's conclusion; the relationship between Sophie and Howl also remains argumentative and strained until the conclusion. There, in the length of a single chapter, Howl matures and they both realize their true feelings and begin their romantic relationship. Another downfall is the extensive cast. Many of the characters appear only briefly or very late, and become lost in a mess of names and short scenes. Do not mistake: the book is still easily readable, and the plot makes sense and resolves to a logical conclusion. But the plot and the character identities and developments are not as clear as they could be, and the book suffers for it: the story becomes muddled, and so the themes become muddled.<br /><br />Despite the muddled plot, many other aspects of the book shine like diamonds. From the premise, to the characters (at least the better developed ones), to the lively sense of humor, to the land and magic of Ingary, Jones creates a colorful, vivid, truly human story. There is a certain amount of playful irreverence to every aspect of the book: Howl is a beautiful man who seduces beautiful women--and spends two hours in the bathroom every day. Sophie turns from a dull young woman into a batty old lady, taking out her frustrations by vicious house cleaning and calling even Calcifer the fire demon \\"young.\\" The book's setting is similarly off kilter and playful: Howl's moving castle, which frightens Sophie's city, is the same castle that Howl uses to run away from girls, identities, and obligations; in the land of Ingary, magic is at once part of life (so Sophie is entirely unsurprised by her curse) and complete unexpected (so she is frightened of the cursed the scarecrow that chases the castle). Jones exhibits a rare sense of humor. Nothing--not suffering, not journeys, not love--is taken too seriously, and so her book is continually amusing, but at the same time, everything is meaningful--brief plot points come back at the end of the story, and the humorous, faulted characters do go on to immense personal growth. This unusual and delicate combination makes for a book that is funny, colorful, and always a joy to read, but is at the same time intensely authentic, human, and meaningful.<br /><br />I hugely adore the Miyazaki film based on this book, so I will admit that I was disappointed to see how different the film and book are, and even more disappointed that (as very rarely happens) the film is in this case a better story. Nonetheless, I was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, and I do recommend it. There are some definite faults, and the book is ultimately too complex, muddled, and abrupt, but it remains a delightful read. Jones's style is a pleasure, her characters are faulted, funny, and ultimately realistic, and Sophie's journey--through places, meeting people, and finally discovering herself--makes for a truly wonderful story. This book was not everything I hoped it would be, but I'm still glad I had a chance to read it. It is a young adult title, but I recommend it to all readers. Any age group can and will appreciate the humanity and humor of this text.and delicate combination makes for a book that is funny, colorful, and always a joy to read, but is at the same time intensely authentic, human, and meaningful.

B000H5V8DG|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday.  After reading the other reviews and seeing all the horror stories about discs being scratched and unplayable, I checked every disc immediately after the product arrived.  Most of the discs were in good shape, but some had minor scratches.  Nothing too bad, but the design is just stupid.  I was very impressed with the actual look of the box, and the secret compartment is pretty cool.  If only the disc sleeves didn't induce scratching.  Overall, a very good product though.

And #3 was just as wonderful as the first 2-which is saying a lot-as this is something that seems to be very difficult and rare to do with movie trilogies (for example: Spiderman, Rush Hour, etc). I am looking forward to adding this 3rd movie to my Bourne collection and will be able to watch all 3 with the same satisfaction and delight.I am sorry to see the trilogy end, but happier to see it end incredibly well. Matt Damon has excelled in these movies and each one is a treat. I will miss new 'Bourne' movie releases, but will be able to enjoy each one at home.A 'must have' movie for Bourne fans!
B00005JKG7|4.0|i have to say the fog is another of john carpenters good pieces of work. i kind of new is was going to be good, just cause of that, and he pulled it off. i have to admit though that this and the remake are on the same level for me. this was creepy, because you never really see those lost souls, and when you do, they're shadows. left to your imagination, which can play all sorts of things. it was good for it's time. it had some crazy slasher stuff in there. when they brought out those knifes and hooks boy did they let you have it. they didn't hold back, and i thought that was way nice. a sinister fog rolls into antonio bay on it's 100th birthday, bringing with it a crew with a thirst for revenge. a crew of people carrying a horrible desease, were lured to their deaths a 100 years ago, by a few men who were controlled by greed and fell back on their word. not only did these men steal their lives, but also their gold. taking everything, from these people who just wanted a little place to call home. the town of antonio bay was witness to a terrible secret. one many thought dead and gone, but on this night, it returns to seek the ones that are to blame. no one can escape the fog, that swallows you before you even know it. could there be an end to it. a life for a life. it's haunting, and in some ways unexpected. it had some of those moments where you kind of jerk a bit, and the ending was unforgettable. the cast was a nice one. tom atkins, good actor. adrienne barbeau, played her part very well. she just fell into character. as for jamie lee curtis, her acting speaks for itself. any role you give her, she'll outdo herself. of course she's a lot better know than she was then, but in this film she still manages to get your attention. good story, good actors, good movie.

B00003CX95|5.0|with that being said, you know this movie is running deep. words that ring so true, when you take a look at your life. braveheart is one of the best films out there. it gave so much inspiration to fight for what you believe in. love, to live it, fight for it, and die for it. strength, to endure pain, loss, and everything else that comes with war. a tale of bravery, honor, and triumph. to win a battle is not what counts, but to fight with heart is what conquers. a truly amazing film. mel gibson exceeded many expectations with both directing/producing and starring in this film. he proved he's more than an actor. although a very talented and gifted man this movie just puts him on top. the story is one of beauty and meant to go down in history. a man that wants nothing to do with battle, but when it touches him and seems to beckon to him and taunt him, he has no choice but to defend what is rightfully his and noone  elses: his freedom. he loses a love so dear at the hands of a coward, he will avenge it. you cross william and you can bet your life is his. in a world of take, take, take, he gives no more. he stands up for a love that is lost, for himself, for the people that follow. he becomes a legend. known to destroy all those who come against him. he is william wallace, a man to be feared. a man who was a nobody, until he fought back. it takes one person to change the world. after scenes and scenes of bloody battles, you never seem to get tired of it. they are very well done, and the fight is so intense you feel as if you're on the sidelines. it goes so deep you find yourself rooting for this man and his cause. his words are enough to move you and his actions are enough to move mountains. he fights, and to the death if he must. because no matter what he knows he's lived a full life, doing and leaving a piece of him wherever he goes. even the king begins to fear him, his son being a coward, he sends his sons wife to negotiate with william about a surrender or a truce,but he does niether. although as a result she ignites something in him he thought he'd never feel again. and she feels the same. so a new love is born. a passion that could never be revealed for it is forbidden. although a brief tender moment is better than to have never felt that way at all. after all he's accomplished, and everything he's done he will always be remembered. but where there are heros there are traitors. and that is his downfall. a dirty trick to capture him and bring him to the king to make an example of him to all others who wish to continue to fight for freedom. all the while facing torture and death he does not relent, or regret anything he has done. not even the sorrowful pleas of his lady love can make him ask for forgiveness to the king. it is torture to see her beg him to stay with her, and gives him the antidote so he won't feel a thing. he doesn't take it. he will go out there and die an honorable death. extremely touching, and you can't help but wince in pain at the sight of his pain. his love for his freedom meant more to him than anything else. he was going to die, but he would never be forgotten. for he left behind more than a legacy. he left his bloodline. excellent movie an absolute must see.

B000O75VSK|5.0|I am a After Forever first timer, I bought this CD to check them out before going to their show in Bedford, NH. Yeah, I was one of the 40 showing up, what a shame :-). Anyway...    This is a pretty much perfect symphonic metal CD.    After Forever's music is a thick but not muddy background of two guitars and keyboard. Somebody did a good job to keep these these apart and away from the voice, you have a medium-high speed background that drives the music forward.    Not that Floor's voice needs protection, it is extremely powerful. More of a direct, no-nonsense voice, always keeping in the \\"singing range\\", never shouting or screaming. There are some growly male vocals in here, but much less than other bands with growls.    There is a number of ballads on there and again, After Forever just know how to do it. No bombastic landslide style instruments. Show off the voice, support it properly. Many songs show good variety, including \\"Dreamflight\\" which is an 11 minute true symphonic piece.    This is not death or trash or speed metal, I would describe it as a mix of symphonic and power metal. I hesitate to mention power metal at all, because After Forever have \\"true\\" power from Floor's voice and they are not at all like some European power metal acts that spend their time posing and fiddling with guitar effects. Speaking of guitar work, there are nice pieces of that in here (although somebody needs his wah-wah time limited).    I haven't checked out the extra DVD yet but since this CD is a clear 5 out of 5 anyway I can as well write a review now.    Overall After Forever are the rising Star in my favorite band list, so please excuse me now while I order their other CDs.
B000UNYK76|4.0|I got this for my Husband, we are big Pearl Jam fans. This DvD is amazing. Great footage and an excelent set list.
0743486285|4.0|I bought Nikki Sixx's book, not expecting much. Im a huge fan of biographies and autobiographies, and an occasional diary. This diary, was by far my favorite. It was very entertaining and interesting to read about someones struggles with addiction. I recommend  this book to anyone.
0143038583|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know about where food comes from.  The book goes a little overboard on some subjects, such as the corn.   It is very informative and makes you think about the food you are eating, but I haven't changed any of my eating habits.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|I knew this was going to happen, I just had a feeling in my gut. I have already bought the UK version as well as the US version, but now, they release it all together - which is what they should have done in the beginning. It's all great and totally worth it. I know it now.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|I hardly remember this movie coming out in the theaters, that is not usually a good sign.  But we watched it anyway, and I have to say it was just ok.  It started off just fine, with our hero explaining his powers and his issues.  But it has a really dumb ending.  That episode of dallas comes to mind when Sue Ellen dreamed the whole season while her season long dead husband was showering.  I am probably the only one who remembers that.  Anyway, it was ok.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce never fails...great mixture wonderful writing...the E-Street Band back in full affect...makes you count down the days to the concert...Great to have them all back together doing what they do best rockin the house...Love him...so worth you listening to..enjoy
B00009Y3L4|3.0|I've bought the DVD CABARET from you and it seems like it's not an original. It's dark and can't be seeing properly
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural the second season is great, it is a lot funnier than the first season. It has a lot of suspense and drama and two very hot boys. The second series answers alot of the unanswered questions from season 1, like is Dean going to live, and what happened to the yellow eyed demon and is Sam ever going to find out about his powers of premonition? So make sure you get this season of supernatural. It also has a lot of special features like the hillarious gag reel. Well I hope you enjoy it like I did.
0385522401|4.0|I found this book very well written and a good bookclub discussion book.  I thought it was a different subject matter for a man to write about but he seemed to hit the nail on the head in his descriptions.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|The product description says \\"this is the definitive release that fans have been waiting for!\\" But I am a fan and I have bought the previous version of the DVD, and since I am not millionaire who does not care even if this set is 800 dollars (which I paid for the previous version) , I have NOT been waiting for a repackage of the show which pissed the true fan of TNG. Great job, movie studios who only know how to repackage old product and are not respecting the true fan. I am glad I have not wasted money on DS9 and VOY cause I know you will eventually  release some cheaper \\"definitive\\", \\"ultimate\\", \\"collector's\\" versions later. I will go for netflex now, if you know what I mean.

B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is just your everyday social misfit in high school as she has been taunted and tormented by some students as she feels like an outcast. She discovers that she has telekinetic powers, Carrie also has a psychotic religious mother (Piper Laurie) and one night at the prom she goes berserk with her powers after a cruel prank goes bad.<br /><br />Co-starring William Katt, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving this movie is one of the greatest cinematic horror masterpieces of all time. Brian DePalma was a great choice in directing this classic supernatural shocker and it is faithful to Stephen King's classic novel, the performances are excellent especially the cute Ms. Spacek as Carrie and the music score is quite memorable in this movie even the prom sequence that made this a classic.<br /><br />This special edition DVD has excellent picture and sound quality with fine extras like theatrical trailer, two documentaries by Brian DePalma called \\"Visualizing Carrie\\" and \\"Acting Carrie\\" with the stars of the film, A bio on Stephen King, a featurette on the broadway musical of \\"Carrie\\" and a animated photo gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Scanners\\", \\"Akira\\", \\"The Shining\\", \\"Firestarter\\", \\"The Fury\\", \\"Making Contact (a.k.a.

031286504X|5.0|I am a huge horror fan, but that being said this is my favorite of them all. It is the most amazing books I've read and believe me I've read thousands. I love this book because of the meaning behind it. Needless to say if you haven't read it and your looking for something that will make a profound impact on your thinking read it.
B0000025D0|3.0|This is my favorite Springsteen album bar none!<br /><br />I love every track on it and anyone at all interested in rock n roll owes it to themself to own a copy.  That being said, this CD BADLY needs a 30th annv. reissue with remastering and all the trimmings.  It deserves such treatment.<br /><br />Currently, this is a 5-star album on a 3-star CD.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I am always looking out for a good guitar rock and blues jam and this is it. The performers are absolutely incredible, and the sound is terrific. The video production is also great, very good footage from various interesting angles. Good shots of the performers guitar work. Great song selections too. I was a little hesitant at first, but am glad I purchased this video. My teen son also finds this video great too. Leroy
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I remember the movie Dune on TV one time when I was a young man, and I loved the movie, even if I didn't fully understand it.  What I didn't know at the time was that this was the famous \\"Smithee Version\\" with extra scenes added in.  So, recently I purchased this Extended Version DVD and was surprised at how many scenes were missing from the Theatrical Version.  The film felt choppy and there wasn't a lot of context to what was going on.<br /><br />However, when I watched the Extended Version on the other side of the DVD, I really enjoyed the film so much more.  There were a lot of scenes added in that helped round out the story.  The bonus deleted scenes are pretty interesting too, as is the alternate ending (which more closely matches the novel).<br /><br />Overall, Dune was way ahead of its time.  The cast was really stellar and had some very believable characters (Piter de Vries, Rev. Mohiam, the Emperor to name a few), and the scenery was just awesome.  I never get tired of watching the ships board the Guild Highliner for example.<br /><br />The one nagging problem in the Extended Version was the way small scenes were needlessly recycled.  The Wikipedia article mentions that this was done to give the illusion of more scenes, but it was easy to spot scenes that were recycled.<br /><br />In any case, I have already watched this DVD twice in one week, and really felt that this Extended Version was worth the purchase.  Dune fans will definitely enjoy all the features and extra scenes found here.
B000VT55G4|1.0|The Contract is a far-fetched, ill-conceived and way too predictable movie. I thought the premise and the combination of Cusack and Freeman might offer something decent, but this movie regurgitates way too many cliches and executes them poorly. The writing (and in many places the acting) is bad and makes it very difficult to try and maintain any suspension of disbelief -- the intended drama of \\"trained professional killers in the woods chasing a man and his somewhat estranged son\\" simply fizzles into nearly laugh-out-loud ludicrous, \\"yeah, that's going to happen\\" moments and implausible plot pieces seemingly thrown together without a cohesive plan.
0312330537|5.0|Amazing book. The depth GDR reaches within himself and within the human experience is breathtaking. I go back over and over again to re-read passages. If only there was an index!
B00092ZL80|2.0|I found this disappointing! without Maurice White and Peter Cetera it's just not complete. The performance is entertainging but just falls short without the two main guys. Leroy
B000UR9TQO|3.0|I would like to address nmollo from London.(I assume England) \\"Obscure rock band from the 70's.\\"  That is very funny. Sarcasm is tantamount to treason if you bad mouth Zeppelin in the U.S.A. Anyway, The Song Remains the Same will be available on a two-disc DVD in November, I hear. Preorder your copy today!
B000ROALCG|5.0|The soundtrack performed by Marc Anthony was nothing short of perfect  He assimilated himself into the persona of Hector Lavoe in ways that were almost eerie.  Lavoe was a legend and Marc is another living legend who someday will have a movie depicting his own life.  The only thing I would have hoped for were a few more songs on the cd. In particular a song called Periodico de Ayer which was one of Lavoe's greatest and actually was in the movie so I didn't quite get why it wasn't there on the cd. All in all, if you are a Hector Lavoe afficionado or a Marc Anthony lover then you absolutely NEED to have this in your collection.
B00005JPTA|5.0|I have lived my entire life avoiding violent films--westerns, war movies, anything with guns---I stayed away from.  Two years ago a friend wanted to see A History of Violence and I accompanied her....not a film I would have normally chosen.  My!  Perhaps I discovered a hidden appetite for violence?  I'm not sure about that, but I certainly discovered a hearty appreciation for Viggo Mortensen.    So, today, when I had a break and I saw that Eastern Promises was at a theater near me, I went to see it.  I had not read reviews, (something I recommend) but I figured if Mortensen was in it, it must be worth seeing.    I was not disapointed!  As amazing as his performance was in \\"Violence\\" this totally eclipses it.  His posture, his facial expressions, his voice, as the Russian punk are nothing short of wondrous.  If he doesn't win this year's Oscar I will feel about the same way as when the ballots were counted at the last presidential election.      Yes it is violent but it works to highlight the extremes of the character.  Without seeing what he goes through \\"in service to\\" the Russian mafia, we can't appreciate the heights of his actions.  The simple kiss between Mortensen and Watts...that's all the romance we get here...is enough to light up the whole theater.    Yes, the bathhouse scene is amazing!  And worth all the talk!      Despite the occasional unsparing violence, this is a totally enjoyable film!  The story unfolds in a suspensful way from the get-go.  We don't know who the good guys are from the bad guys.  I loved the complexity of the Mafia's chief ...who delicately pulled pink rose petals to decorate the cake of the birthday of a hundred year old fellow emigree...  yet was the cause of suffering of hundreds of young girls.  The scene of the older Russian women singing along to an old folk tune is quite touching.      All in all, this is a masterful film and I heartily recommend it.  And did I mention that Viggo Mortensen was extraordinary?!
B000654YRY|4.0|This is one that tugged at my heart. Mark touched everyone at the concert. I watched and listened spellbound. And wow! Money for nothing!#$@* Get's you stomping. Brothers in Arms, is my favorite in the video. One can almost feel what Mark is feeling, his passion, his respect for those who gave thier lives.And nothing like watching their live performances. I never tire watching this video. A good buy. Leroy
B000XKZQ74|5.0|This movie is absolutely fascinating. It kept my wife and me on the edge of our seats. Not a slow film in my opinion. The tale of a cold and systematic Stazi investigator starting to secretly emphasize with the objects of his investigation. This is especially interesting because the movie is based on a true story. There are quite a few surprising twists and turns.<br />Apparently the movie release was interrupted by German courts because some (real) person(s) depicted by the movie sued for injunction due to defamation. I don't know whether this version here at Amazon is the original version or a modified release.<br />One of the best movies I have seen this year.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|All I have seen by today is 5 charters, and I am attonished by this spectacular production. It has inspired me to have very nice thoughts about our reason to live in planet Earth.
B000009ED0|5.0|The only things wrong with this album are the censorship, guest \\"rappers\\" and song arrangement which is absolutely horrible.  1-13-12-7-10-5-3-9-4-2-6-8-11-14 makes it a near-masterpiece.
0375842209|5.0|As a lover of historical fiction and especially fiction set in Europe during WWII, I was drawn to THE BOOK THIEF after browsing the book jacket.  It did not disappoint.  As other reviewers have noted, the author's writing style, through his narrator (\\"Death\\"), is a bit off-putting in the early pages, but I quickly found the rhythym of the prose to be musical and almost magical.<br /><br />THE BOOK THIEF and Khaled Hosseini's \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" are easily my best reads of 2007 . . . and I don't expect another will topple either from that perch.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I've always loved this movie but have never seen it on anything other than poor quality streaming internet video. This DVD is fantastic. I finally get to see what all of my favorite characters look like and all the special features are great. I didn't expect that many features, because I honestly thought this was a bootleg but no it's great quality and full of good special features.

And also for everyone how likes good clean music.
0761145613|5.0|This is the sixth year (I believe) that I have had this calendar and I'll keep purchasing this one, year after year, because I have yet to find one that even compares or surpasses it in organizing or looks!  One feature that I really like is that it is a true 16-month calendar (the 4 months aren't all on one page behind the cover...).  With our oldest in school, it is soo nice to be able to look back and see when he stayed home sick or how long we have had to do a project...  : )  The spaces to write daily actives/events in are 1 1/2 x 5/8\\", so you have sufficient room to write.  The pictures (artwork by Sandra Boynton) is adorable!  I like this calendar SO much that I have one in our bedroom, one by our desk, and one in our kitchen!  Now my fianc&eacute; can never use the excuse that 'he didn't know the dinner was today!'  : )
0385508476|2.0|This is not an \\"easy read\\" if that's what you're looking for.  Plan to spend some time trying to get into this book.  Way too technical for what I was looking for.
1596912375|2.0|Pretty basic spy novel, not particularly literary.  I expected more from a Costa Novel Award winner.
0805079831|3.0|Naomi Klein has written this book about the rise of what she calls \\"disaster capitalism\\": the global imposition/adoption of Chicago School (neoliberal) economics since the early 1970s. This is a particularly important book because, while many have written about the same topic, I have never seen it treated in a form that is both holistic (ie. a global history) and accessible (ie. largely free from the academic jargon of economics and social theory). The book does suffer from some problems however.     Klein's main thesis is problematic. She writes that the idea of economic shock therapy arose out of the same logic as Electric Convulsive Therapy (ECT). This idea is to create or exploit a destructive event in order to create regression, passivity, and a 'blank slate' on which to build a new order. In supporting this thesis, Klein uses all of Part I of her book to write about psychological torture and the CIA's mind control experiments. She attempts to develop a 'poetics of torture' that links the individual violence of ECT to the structural violence that occurs when neoliberalism is imposed as a governing strategy. Klein is no poet however, and the metaphor seems to die pretty early on in the book. She does thankfully offer a more implicit thesis that she invokes more regularly and supports more thoroughly: free markets did not develop through freedom, but through authoritarian or technocratic interventions.    Secondly, Klein treats capitalism as if it were only 35 years old. Her book however is thematically similar to the work of another woman who wrote on the same issues a century before: Rosa Luxemburg. By only going as far back as the rise of Keynsianism and developmentalism, Klein makes it seem as though neoliberalism is a radical historical exception. Yet it seems that, since the industrial revolution, it is Keynsianism that itself was the historical exception.    This book is mostly comprised of what are essentially case studies. Each case study could certainlybe expanded into its own 600-page book, so simplification was necessary. I think that it is also necessary for the author to explicitly admit the complexity of any situation beyond just the power of market forces, which act strongly and ubiquitously but never alone. I think she does admit the shortcomings of her case studies for Israel/Palestine, South Africa, and Iraq (her best and most personally-involved ones), but not for the rest.    All in all, this book is worth a read and is a good introduction to one of the most powerful forces of our times. I just hope that it inspires people to read some other books that illuminate more of the complexities in regards to the theory and practice of neoliberalism in our communities, countries, and worlds. I particularly recommend David Harvey's A Brief History of Neoliberalism.

B000UR366S|5.0|The newest work by Joni Mitchell is both relevant and beautiful.  It is highly political in content and sublime in form.  The new songs are complex and insightful.

B000XKZQ74|2.0|A German language movie with English subtitles, it's very slow, and I found myself fast forwarding thru much of it. It does show a very disturbing picture of life in the GDR just before the wall came down with Artists being monitored by the Stazi.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|NEXT had all the ingredients of a good idea, but was poorly executed by it's screenwriters and its actors. I really liked this concept, but was quickly bored to death after about 30 minutes.    When you find yourself yawning and fast-forwarding your DVD, that's not a good thing.    Plus, the bomb that this was at the Box Office should have raised a big red flag. But despite that, sometimes we moviegoers don't find all the hidden gems until later in movies.    This ain't one of them.
0525950079|3.0|Read the Doomesday Book by Connie Willis instead.  In this book, Follett populated a world with 20th century inhabitants and labled it 14th century.  This book won´t take you back in time, you´ll recognize everyone.   Freud and Carl Rogers were around there somewhere. The characters say they feel the terror of the plague, but you won´t feel it.

B000LC4TJ0|5.0|I bought this mainly because of my admiration for Anna Netrebko: a recent discovery for me. It presents a darker aspect of Beaumarchais' tale than the lightness of Mozart's divine music usually reveals, despite the strangely \\"invisible\\" Cherubino with angel's wings, but this adds realism without detracting from the sheer beauty of the production. I hope I may soon be able to see Anna in \\"Così fan Tutte\\".
0786890754|1.0|The story line seems really good, but i had to stop reading the book at about the third chapter, because of all the swear words. I did not appreciate that very much at all.

B000O179FO|5.0|If you want to show off your HD screen and the high quality of Blu-ray this is the DVD to own.  The grain is almost non-existent and the lighting simply perfect.  Not only is this a great movie but it is true eye candy.

B000A0GP0Y|1.0|What did I like about this film?  Was there anything worth keeping with this nearly play by play remake that would make even the British version blush?  Outside of the hits and the music, there was absolutely nothing.  \\"The Longest Yard\\" was the sorriest sad sack of a comedy ever to be called a film.  While it tried to be identical to the first, it misses the mark mainly due to the characters, the cheap inserted jokes, and the obvious over budget.  Do we need to be spending millions of dollars to make the grass greener?  Before I begin, I want everyone to look at the box to this DVD - see Adam grinning - does he look tough enough, does he look like a QB, does he look like he can be hit by huge linebackers and live to tell?  My answer is no, and for you hoping to see a Happy Gilmore in a football jersey, you will be sadly disappointed.  This film was plastic wrap in its grandest of ways.  This film is Styrofoam when you really just needed a big belly laugh to ease the day.  This film was clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; with a VERY LOUD soundtrack.  How could this be?  Basically, this was the same film that Reynolds did a long time ago, but with Adam Sandler ... shouldn't it be funnier?<br /><br />Alas it wasn't.  How did this film fail?  After watching the original film, the British \\"Mean Machine\\", and finally this one, I came to realize that the spirit was just missing from the cast, the production, and the design.  While Sandler spewed the same lines that Reynolds did during his prime, it was difficult for me to see Sandler filling into Reynolds' boots.  The two actors are not the same, the age of America is different, and what originally was a creative film about self-discovery, turned into an over-budgeted film about trying to make the audience see those amazing hits that can be seen on ESPN.  Director Peter Segal has nobody to blame but himself.  \\"The Longest Yard\\" is one of those films that couldn't be remade today because the surrounding themes are obsolete.  The bulk of this issue falls on the casting.  I have already denounced Sandler, but Chris Rock is the icing on the cake.  He is absolutely not Caretaker.  He was not the smart, Jiminy Cricket-esque character that Crewe needed to see what was important to him in the long run.  When it comes to the quintessential pinch moment, there is no emotion - I literally didn't care what happened between the two.  They tried to be funny together with words, but the humor in the original fell in the situation, not Rock lounging around like this was his obvious first day at prison.  The rest of the story, with the miscast of these two, fell completely to the ground.  Sandler's cronies are there, Schnieder humiliating himself again, but Cromwell made me twitch again.  Where was his evil, his motive, his sinister tenacity?  Again, due to a much bigger budget, bigger stars, and a decision to make the punches bigger than the story, Segal let this film slip right out of his hands and into a failed category.<br /><br />Nothing worked in this film - at least I didn't think anything did until I finished the film and found myself humming a few bars from the music.  The music was way TOO LOUD - it distracted (like so many other elements of this remake) from the essential storylines, but it was perfect music for this film.  They strengthened the hits, made us feel like we were on the field with the team, and inspired us to root for the good guys - but the music alone doesn't create an amazing film (unless it is a musical - but I digress).  \\"The Longest Yard\\" suffered because of its poor character development, its poor casting decision, the painful story, and the insufferable direction.  Yet, the music remained a constant focus.  Thank you music team - it is the only one that I am handing out for this review.<br /><br />Overall, I hated this film.  It disgraced the original and I don't even find myself a fan of sports films.  If I had to rank these three films (the original, the remake, andthe British) it would be a tight race between Vinnie Jones and young Reynolds - I thought that the Brits seemed to have a better grasp on what this film was trying to accomplish more than Segal did.  Sandler was a joke, Rock sunk to the bottom, and it was obvious that Reynolds was just in it for the nostalgic effect.  While the cameos by the ex-jocks would make any enthusiast drool, they try their best to hold up any remaining value to this film.  It took me two views to make it through this, while I can nearly recite all of the lines from \\"Happy Gilmore\\" or \\"Billy Madison\\".  That should be the perfect example of what horrid road Sandler has been traveling.  I would strongly suggest skipping this film.  Watch the original or import, but seem to know better what comedy is all about than Mr. Segal.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****ce between Vinnie Jones and young Reynolds - I thought that the Brits seemed to have a better grasp on what this film was trying to accomplish more than Segal did.

055358202X|5.0|I started reading Jordan in 1993, and while loving it, knew that it was still Boy Hero vs. Dark Lord. I resisted reading Martin at first because I heard of its grittiness and lack of magic. But now that I understand both that magic is real and that it is shy like the \\"magic\\" in Ice and Fire, I totally love his approach. I love the development of his characters. It is unparalleled. I love that the characters have gray areas, that characters with integrity make compromised decisions. I appreciate that characters who act with integrity but naively with respect to the motivations of others get manipulated or harmed by those others. It is cool that he has a at least one psychopath (a character entirely devoid of conscience, i.e., The Mountain That Rides) as a major character. This particular book is slightly awkward due to the fact that it is one half of one volume that was somewhat hurriedly turned into a stand alone book, but I would rather read this than have to wait 5 years for the one volume that would have been. I beg you, George! Give us another one!

0767903862|4.0|This is Bill Bryson's fifth and latest (last?) travel narrative and in it he writes with a bit more confidence and maturity as he navigates from the \\"frappaccino heaven that is modern Sydney\\" to the Gold Coast, Ayers Rock, the tropics, and beyond. And he does so in the classically effervescent, witty, and thoughful manner for which he has become famous. This first-hand account gets lots of support from historical snippets and overviews, almost all of which are intriquing, and it's clear Bryson has done his homework. It is not as humourous as his other books nor is it as fast. Yes, in some sections, it is even somewhat slow, but certainly this only mirrors what travelling in a country as vast and relatively empty as Australia must really be like. Largely absent from this book are the author's famous rants. He is enamoured with Australia and seldom has a bad encounter or a negative thing to say, although when he does it's typically amusing. His estimation of the country is that it is largely a blend of American and British influences, primarily the positive influences. And therein may lie the book's chief flaw. It's a bit too positive in places. Later, I read Paul Theroux's The Happy Isles of Oceania, familar with the premise, but oblivious to the fact that New Zealand and Australia would occupy the first hundred pages. Theroux's descriptions of Australia, though not complete (nor intended to be), were arguably more revealing about the national character, at least to my way of thinking. Nevertheless, In a Sunburned Country is a fine book written by a fine writer.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt, author

0380713802|4.0|This was my first Bill Bryson book and I can still remember riding the subway to work and errupting into fits of frenzied laughter as dour-faced clerks and bankers peered disapprovingly at me over their morning broadsheets. If you happen to be one of those people, I apologize. I couldn't help myself.<br /><br />With Neither Here Nor There, you are not going to get a comprehensive travel guide to Europe filled with effusive descriptions or ponderous sentences like, 'Politically, as well as socially, Sweden is currently at a crossroads....' Rather, what you will get is an irreverant account of comedian-philosopher Bill Bryson country hopping about the world's most-cultured continent with no real purpose, point, or plan. And yet it works. From encounters with non-English-speaking Swedes to a flashback of a run-in with some beer-swilling, redneck Austrians, this diminuative volume makes for some great escapism. And between the jokes, there's some fine writing, a foreshadowing, of sorts, of things to come. Bryson's description of his experience in Norway, for example, is deftly-penned. Please note that this book isn't meant to be taken seriously. Its title should tell you that.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt, author of Why China Will Never Rule the World
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown is probably one of the last great film noir movies. In my view, it's a tad overrated. The absolute best feature of the movie is the script. The complex nature of the plot, with its many twists and deceptions, is a modern classic. While the movie is long, and the characters come across as people with whom it's hard to sympathize (until it's too late), the storyline is such that you are compelled to see how it unravels.  So, if you're interested in an intelligent and very original story, Chinatown is a great choice. It's a very languid film, but with patience, the viewer is rewarded with a remarkable story.  There's an impressive line up of celebrated actors. Their performances aren't bad, but no tour de force at the end of the day.  5 stars for the script.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Just like the first season, this keeps you guessing the whole way through.  And you'll be on the edge of your seat as the season comes to a close.  This is really an amazing show!
B000H5U832|5.0|We love this movie. We purchased a replacement DVD because our son wore out the first one... it didn't last a year in our house! Our son, who just turned 3, has most of the movie memorized... we also have the soundtrack (another great buy!). Highly recommend this movie about what's really important in life...friendship and helping others.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|This early 1990's version of the classic Bram Stoker story has a lot going for it. The director is Francis Ford Coppola who made The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Combine this with a cast including Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves and you'd have thought this was a recipe for a masterpiece - sadly not I'm afraid.<br /><br />Although visually its very impressive, especially in the excellent first half hour, in general the whole thing is hugely overblown and in a lot of cases over-acted. I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins, but in the key role of Van Helsing he just overplayed his part too much. A little less ham please Sir Anthony. However, its unfair only to level criticism at one actor. In general this applies to the whole cast. Gary Oldman although not as bad as Hopkins has the same problem. Perhaps we should blame Coppola.<br /><br />Lets be positive though. The music score by Wojciech Kilar is excellent and I bought the soundtrack recording of this when it first came out. In many ways his score is reminisant of James Bernards great scores for the Hammer Dracula films. Furthermore in comparison to the truly awful 'Van Helsing' (2004) this IS a masterpiece. So this is a good film, with some flaws yes, but very entertaining nevertheless, and I have bought it.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|As the previous reviewer said there isn't much more to be said. This is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Its even more remarkable for being over 50 years old now, as some of the special effects, if dated now, are good enough to make you think 'how the hell did they do that in 1956'? Remember no CGI at all.<br /><br />Its influence on the original Star Trek series in terms of the story and the sets is clear for all to see: A long dead civilisation leaving behind a mind enhancing machine. An apparent Alien force that can't be seen. Sets made of polystyrene etc....<br /><br />Quite a few important Science Fiction films were made in the 1950's, but this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. If you've never seen it you've missed an absolute classic.

0440238609|2.0|This is one of those times where I just don't get how other people could come to the conclusion that something like this deserved any awards.  I don't my conclusion is purely a matter of holding different individual preferences or personal beliefs either.   This series just doesn't match up to the hype it's received.    I agree with many other reviewers, that the first one is the best of the lot, and the third hardly digestible; but even the first one doesn't rate five stars.  The alternate reality Pullman creates is imaginative, but his characters, dialogue, and moralizing are not.   Sure, bears in armor are pretty interesting, and the daemon idea was somewhat unusual, but armored bear, 12 year old girl, and gyspy-like men are all depicted in a similarly flat fashion.  It also seemed to me that the daemons, instead of lending much of creative value, provide a short-cut venue for characters to talk to themselves and let us silly readers in on what's supposed to be happening.  Lots of telling and very little showing here.  Finally - the dialogue!  I could barely stomach it, especially in number three.  When Pullman doesn't use dialogue to preach at us, it seems like he wants to use it to try his hand at harlequin-esque romance.  Twelve year old protagonists breathlessly declaring their eternal love, spending the night in each other's arms, sharing hot kisses and thrilling touches?  And all this is supposed to save the Universe from that nasty, horrible, God person and all his evil minions?  Uh...come again?
B00005JPFH|5.0|come on people your views on this movie are stupid and uncalled for.  i LOVED THIS MOVIE.  i LOVE sam rami he is the best director on earth, i am a little upset that i have been hearing that their might not be a fourth one.  but i am more upset that you people are giveing such bad reviews about it.  dont you have anything nice to say, i was taught that if you dont have anything nice to say then you shouldnt say anything at all, there i have said what i thought.  if you dont have anything nice to say just dont write a review.

B0006GAOJA|5.0|Raging Bull directed by Martin Scorsese is probably his best film to date. Filmed in gorgeous black and white, Raging Bull tells the story of true-life boxer Jake La Motta played brilliantly by De Niro. He gained a lot of weight for this role, he is truly unrecognizable towards the end of the film, but besides that his blistering performance earned him his second Oscar, his portrayal is both frightening and riveting. This is one film every aspiring filmmaker should see, one of the essentials. Enjoy!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|The factory Canon batteries are truly better than the knock-offs.  They are worth the extra dollars for their reliability.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This album has been described as sounding like a monotone lecture read within a much more powerful musical composition. This might be true in that the tone of this artist's voice seems as if it could be mistaken as the same from one track to the next. Nonetheless, in this case, it works...and it works well. Even if it were to be played on loop, ten times in one sitting, each song would be more overwhelming than the last, and every time the same track was heard for the second, third or fourth time, the sound would seem more pure that that of previous listens. This album, in its entirety, is definitely one of the best to be offered this year.
0790729369|5.0|Every time this comes on HBO, I watch it because I know how deeply passionate and moved I feel whenever I do. Meryl Streep is a tender force to be reckoned with, and Clint Eastwood seems to flow skillfully right along with her. They are not acting - they are channeling feelings, thoughts, fears.. through this mesmerizing story that nearly everyone has had before. Beautiful. Enchanting. Thank you Meryl and Clint for this gift.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Ironically, in 1974 after seeing a testosterone powered twenty-five year-old Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen at the Harvard Square Theater, music critic Jon Landau wrote, \\"I saw rock and roll's future and its name is Bruce Springsteen.\\" Ironic because here, 43 years later, Bruce seems determined to stake a new claim as rock and roll's future with a little Springsteen \\"Magic.\\" Starting with an opening salvo rant of \\"...this is radio nowhere,\\" Bruce joins the rest of us fellow AARP members in questioning whether  the future of rock and roll includes \\"rythym.\\" With a wink to Roger Water's Radio KAOS, Bruce speaks from the third \\"person\\" silicon view of a satellite searching the radio air waves for \\"...is anyone alive out there?\\" Perhaps something our frustrated silicon friend was wondering about Bruce's music for the last few years too?<br /><br />A quick check of the Billboard Hot 100 answers the question; for \\"Magic\\" the answer is unfortunately, \\"no.\\" Nearly 4 weeks after it's release, the re-union of the E-Street Band finds itself non-existent in the top 100 song chart behind the likes of Soulja Boy, Carrie Underwood, and Jay-Z.  Fortunately for Columbia and Sony's pocketbook, \\"Magic\\" sits atop the Album charts, but a look at the real test of radio air play shows even forgettable pop trivia like Britney Spears' \\"Gimme More\\" making a more substantial claim to the future. So, no, Bruce, there is nobody out there, but I think you really already knew that didn't you?<br /><br />For the most part \\"Magic\\" delivers an enjoyable album experience, although producer Brendan O'Brien's \\"wall of sound\\" layered-track approach requires a chorus backing vocal approach to Bruce's singing that many will find unpleasant. Fortunately, the inevitable live album will bring us back the gravely rock voice we love. Lyrically and musically \\"Magic\\" is more similar to \\"Tunnel of Love\\" than \\"Born in the USA\\" showing a maturity in Bruce's song-writing (although not musically) and not surprisingly he chooses not to take \\"Genesis's\\" approach to reunion by rehashing their hits rather than pushing into new territory. \\"Livin' in the Future\\" is Bruce's way of telling us that he isn't going to look back because \\"...none of this happened yet.\\" Instead he's going into the future even if he has to go there alone. \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" 20 years ago probably would have been a certifiable gold single, it will stick in your mind after only a couple of plays, but in today's market it will probably never get past the adult contemporary top 50.<br /><br />In the course of the second half of the album, Bruce slips away from his planned E-street pop effort and into a personal introspective, and clearly religious perspective. If the message in the cover photo wasn't blatant enough, in \\"I'll Work For Your Love,\\" \\"Long Walk Home,\\" and \\"Devil's Arcade\\" Bruce returns to his Catholic school upbringing and finds that it's where his heart has been all along. (Something his Hollywood contemporaries would now doubt scorn). In what appears (to me) to be an homage to Mother Theresa in \\"I'll Work For Your Love,\\" Bruce, in a rather forced iambic lyrical meter, echoes the life's work of Mother by stating that I'll work for what others \\"...want for free,\\" (I.E.: God's love). A classic Catholic theology resurfaces in the second half of the album for Bruce, as it does to many of us, as we approach, our \\"Long Walk Home.\\"<br /><br />Finally, it would be remiss not to address Bruce's John Kerry Vietnam inspired who'll be \\"The Last To Die\\" for a \\"mistake\\". As a firm supporter of the War, you'd think I might find Bruce's latest foray into politics unappealing, but that's not the case here. He is certainly entitled to his opinion, and his way of expressing it is respectful, albeit accompanied by the kind of naivet&eacute; that surrounds celebrities in America these days. (Basically they think that because they have a microphone they also have something to say). Coincidently the beautiful requiem to long time assistant Terry Magovern who passed away in July, which appears as the hidden track; \\"When They Built You Brother\\" (they broke the mold) stands in contrast to Bruce's anti-war rhetoric. Perhaps if Terry, a former navy seal, were still here he could have told his friend Bruce that no soldier ever died for a \\"mistake,\\" he dies to defend his brothers-in-arms. Bruce, a soldier doesn't go to war to support a political party, he goes, and sometimes doesn't come home, for his country and his brothers, which can never be a \\"mistake.\\"<br /><br />By the end of \\"Magic,\\" you'll know that this wasn't a reunion album it's a farewell. Going out on his own terms, Bruce recognizes that the future doesn't include him, or Terry, or Theresa, or us. For those waiting for a return to the \\"Glory Days,\\" it's going to be a disappointment, but for those who have been listening carefully all along, we always knew that going back was never going to be an option for Bruce Springsteen. Bruce will always be \\"Livin' In The Future\\" because it's where he has always lived, even if the pop future is to be left to Britney and Soulja. Bruce knew that. (You don't sell $100 a seat tickets to teenagers you know.) But for those of us with our AARP discount who can afford a hundred bucks plus for obstructed view seating we'll be there with him for the \\"Long Walk Home\\" because, like your friend Terry, when they built you Bruce, they broke the mold.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|Some reviewers are a bit too stuffy to enjoy a movie like this it seems.  Too often we see movies that are called \\"comedies\\" but are full of silly half jokes that arent funny and you go away dejected while the critics seem pleased that there is something rather intelligent about the whole thing.     This is about the funniest movie ever.  I laughed from beginning to end and so did most in the audience.  It was simply hillarious.  If you want to see a proper comedy that will make you laugh, this is it.      Dont worry about what the idiot critics think.  Go and watch, you will come out having laughed more than you have in a while.

0143038419|4.0|Okay, so \\"throve\\" doesn't rhyme with \\"love.\\" But the word is appropriate - as a result of her efforts, she throve. Eat Pray Love is the story of one woman's gastronomical and spiritual journey from sad broken single divorcee to centered, grounded happy part of a twosome. She relates what led her to become (p 329) \\"the administrator of [her] own rescue.\\" After divorcing herself from a seemingly idyllic existence, her husband, and a boyfriend, journalist Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" \\"Groceries\\" Gilbert leaves her home in America in pursuit of fabulous food and fluency in Italian. During the four months she spends in Italy she gains: a bit of insight, over twenty pounds, language skills, and a certain level of joy. From there, she continues on to India where she lives in the Ashram of her spiritual advisor, the Guru, and whiles away the hours in meditation and prayer, sometimes questioning her resoluteness. She shares one of her best bits of wisdom (p 177), \\"I can choose my thoughts.\\" As well, she meets the charismatic recovering alcoholic Richard from Texas with his spot on blue-collar advice on life. Her third \\"I\\" destination (lots of jokes from her friends on other less choice locations) is Indonesia, where she hopes to tie her scraps of knowledge and spiritual growth together while under the tutelage of a spiritual leader. When reunited, he initially has no memory of their previous encounter. She befriends a local woman and encounters prospective love interests. In a slightly sappy look-how-lucky-she-got sort of way, she does, in fact, find love.<br /><br />Although I disliked certain parts of the book: the first sentence, which indicates inexplicably that this early thirty-something year old woman wants an early twenty-something year old guy to kiss her; the political information she chooses to include to make clear her party affiliation: she imagines (p 32) \\"Bill and Hillary just signed [her divorce petition to God],\\" writes (p 48) \\"the Republicans had just stolen a presidential election,\\" includes statements by Italians--likely in support of her beliefs (p 107) \\"George Bush's war,\\" \\"They died for George Bush's personal vendetta,\\" and (p 287) fantasizes about Bill Clinton; as well as an insensitive and unfunny joke about the ineffectiveness of Saint John's-wort tea (p 49), \\"I drank enough [of the tea] to cheer up a whole Russian gulag (in case she doesn't know, millions died in those camps). But in spite of all that and the fact that I generally detest books that have the slightest \\"self-help\\" feel, I loved it. And I expect that many other women will also get sucked in by her fun-loving gal who writes like your smartest, most witty friend talks.ction,\\" includes statements by Italians--likely in support of her beliefs (p 107) \\"George Bush's war,\\" \\"They died for George Bush's personal vendetta,\\" and (p 287) fantasizes about Bill Clinton; as well as an insensitive and unfunny joke about the ineffectiveness of Saint John's-wort tea (p 49), \\"I drank enough [of the tea] to cheer up a whole Russian gulag (in case she doesn't know, millions died in those camps).

B00000HZFH|5.0|Simply, as perfect an album as you'll ever find.  Perfect From Now On was great, but Keep It Like A Secret is BTS' OK Computer - an album where each song is almost an album-maker on its own.  The album carries a style and sound that isn't duplicated again - once bottled, like OK Computer, genius like this can't really be duplicated, as even the artists themselves can barely imitate them again.

B00005V9IL|1.0|One star rating for the DVD version the studio released, not the movie. The box says \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\", but the only parts that fill the screen of my 1080p HD widescreen are the menus. So if you got an \\"old\\" TV, you're good to go. If your DVD player puts out a 480p signal, you can fill your 1080 screen (with letterbox on top & bottom), but then this is just a crummy looking video picture. Nothing \\"special\\" about that. So if 20th Century Fox knew enough to make the menus HD widescreen compatible, then why not the film? Especially since the release is advertised as \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\". Seems pretty deceptive to me.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I haven't seen the DVD, but the movie itself is just about perfect. It's a beautiful-looking movie, and the story is wonderful. There's a point about midway through the movie where the main characters seem to have everything they've ever wanted, and they're miserable. You're sitting there thinking, How will the filmmakers get themselves out of this one? But they do, beautifully. I don't know why this movie didn't click with audiences the same way most of the other Pixar movies did -- a rat for a hero, the French setting, the fear this would be just another talking animal movie? But this is one of Pixar's best movies and one of the best movies of the year, period. If there's any flaw it's that the themes may resonate more with adults than with kids, but that's OK. No one says you can't challenge kids with smart material.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is right on the mark with what's going on in the world right now, from the government  control of the media down to the fear they impose on their citizens in the name of security. It's a great move for people who have the eye's to see what's really going on.  Highly recommended!

0743297334|2.0|I haven't read Hemingway since a mandatory high school assignment, and now I remember why. Just read The Sun Also Rises with my book group, and every one of us was disappointed. Much is ballyhooed about Hemingway's writing, but we all found it painfully choppy and repetitive, with a tendency towards detail that does nothing to further the story.  This distinctive style may appeal to some, as evidenced by many of the previous reviews, and it must have seemed avant garde in the 1920s. But uniqueness does not equal excellence.    Hemingway's characters were vapid and unsympathetic--all alcoholics, all self-indulgent, all living without purpose, all socioeconomic and racial snobs. What's to like here? And each of the men is unexplainably infatuated with the same woman, whose only claim to fame is her willingness to cuckold her fiancee with anyone with an XY combination. Okay, okay...you don't always have to like the players, but you have to be able to connect with them on some level.  The consensus was that we'd hate to be trapped in an elevator with any of them, and we came away from the novel feeling that we'd learned nothing about what makes people tick.    We did enjoy the chapters that revolved around the bullfights themselves--some really vivid descriptive passages are the reason for my two stars. Otherwise, this was a case of the emperor's new clothes for me--I'll not likely try another Hemingway.
0156030209|5.0|How do you survive over 200 days in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal tiger?  This book will convince you that it is possible.  Along the way, you'll grapple with the struggles and challenges that this 11 year old boy met and survived to relate in his old age.  It makes you wonder how you might respond to theoretically similar challenges of hunger, intellect, persistence, ingenuity and inner strength.  A twist at the end brings the fantastically improbable story into focus for everyone.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Decided to buy this album after procrastinating for what seems ages. One of my better decisions. I played it to some of my students that I teach photography. Who's Paul Simon ? some of them asked. They have their taste now.   The Boy in the bubble track is great listened too when cooking or working. The accordion in the background is a real great part of this track. The album is fun too listen too, brings back some great memories of my childhood living in Zambia.     These are the days of miracle and wonder ! enjoy the album
0316010669|4.0|If you've ever wondered why or how snap decisions are made, this book will be of interest.  Gladwell explains how controlled experiments have explained some of that mystery.  He then goes on to illustrate how those quick judgments can err as easily as they can prove accurate; but, moreover, how it is somewhat possible to train the accuracy of our instantaneous judgments.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|Springsteen's music has aged well, like a fine wine.  Yet as his rocking heart still beats with the passion of his youth, his years have added a special flavor only age can bring.  This album shows that he can still rock with the best of them, but also brings heart and soul to his music.  He still sings ballads of the common man.  He still moves us to sing along with him as he cries out for us to rise up, to band together and to understand that in the words of one who went before him, \\"This Land is Your Land.\\"  While some people might wish he would, as they said about the Dixie Chicks, just shut up and sing we can always count on Springsteen to, through his songs, be the conscience and heart of our nation, the working man.
B000J4QWNQ|3.0|Michael Mann's gritty rough look doesn't show off at all on HD. The movie is good but selling my old copy on dvd to get the HD version was a loss of about $10.
B000002O4X|5.0|I get too emotional when I watch this film from the day it was screened, even now soooo many years later....many women who seek adventure with life and men have a very high price to pay and this personifies this relationship....the music was so well placed and ultimately memorable and is used in some LA radio bits for heavens sake!!!  Streep is the perfect selection for this role and of course Redford in his stoney perfomance as per usual is predictable but us women just fall for this intimacy...you just want to scream at her to understand this man as she is attracted to that type of character but women are portrayed as strong but much more weak than I would prefer...a very emotional and incredibly filmed scene after scene and then there is Juma...but what happened to the dog for cryin out loud!!!???  I will never forget this movie...it moved me to my core as I am very much like Carin or however u spell her name...Nabu??? Mamsa???  oh well, the first flying scene will remain with me forever...
0143038419|5.0|I was certainly intrigued by the extreme swing of ratings for this book prior to reading it. I enjoyed the author's journey and found that I was \\"touched\\" and \\"moved\\" by her experience by the time I read the last page even to the point of my eyes moistening. The India segment was my favourite section in contrast to those who found it very boring.
0446691437|4.0|I enjoyed Pressfield's Gates of Fire, Tides of War, the Afghan Campaign - then I found this, and much to my delight, he shares his views on being creative - not simply being an author, but being an effective human in life.  I loaned the book to a friend, who liked it so much I bought her a copy as a gift.  Pressfield's talent doesn't just go to the very well researched historical fiction; this work is motivational and succinct enough that it makes a very good audio book.  Well worth reading (or listening to) for a change of pace.
B000JIHP88|4.0|Our soon to be 4 month old loves it.  The animals spin around and the leaves flap up and down. We like it because its quiet (unlike most baby toys).    It would really be nice if it had a clamp rather than having to screw it down through the crib rails.  It was a bit of a challenge to find a good place for installation and avoid scratching up the crib.  A clamp would also let it work with a pack and plays.  We cut a hole in a washcloth and used it like a screw washer over the plastic nut.

B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|While the historical accuracies of this movie are debatable, it's more of a tribute to the comic book series.  It's a purely enjoyable movie... well except if you're Persian.  Blu-ray transfer was pretty good too, but not the best I've seen.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|this movie is so interesting & different. i was mesmerized by the club kids outfits & attitudes. both caulkin & green are fantastic in this flick. as soon as i finished watching this movie i immediately played it again. and again.
B000IJ7MCC|5.0|I'm a bellydance instructor in Virginia and this music is just amazing and great to use to dance to.  It is different and I love it.
0099481685|5.0|If you liked the movie Christmas With The Kranks, you must not skip reading Skipping Christmas! John Grisham brings another hit to his readers. The lives of the Kranks are that of a typical family with a far from typical idea of skipping Christmas. The character development is rich and gives the reader a fuller feeling for them. It is a funny and heartwarming film!
B000A59PMO|5.0|The biggest mistake television EVER made was the cancellation of Veronica Mars. It's witty and intelligent and just plain awesome. Who doesn't love Kristen Bell? She's freaking amazing as is the season!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is really great.     I've always loved Monty Python. I love the show and all their movies. If you haven't see this movie then you are really missing out.    The only thing that I could say that would be bad about this movie is the picture and sound quality but other then that I really can't think of anything else.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|i dont care about \\"missing\\" songs, or footage, if you are an AC DC fan you need to get \\"plug me in\\" from the old footage, to the interviews, to the most recent footage of  Angus, and malcom with the stones ( which is realy a cool jam session) and on the first disc.....the song \\" its a long way to the top\\" listen to it closely, and .....well ill leave it @ that  :)    some of the video is rough indeed, but in my opinion its part of the history, and it indeed makes it a much better experience. i too could have done without the giant highway to hell poster, and all the little ticket stubs, but still pretty cool to read them. All in all realy a well done 3 disc set....and again in my mind its not about what songs were on there, and what songs werent, its all about watching and enjoying.....so buy this disc, sit back, turn up the volume and rock n roll!!
B000GY729M|5.0|This album sounds very 80ish which I love.I saw them live and believe me when I say all their music is played exactly like it is on the album.Brandon Flowers is a incredible musician playing piano guitar,he could probably play a harp if you gave him one.There is so much energy and passion in his voice like on the song Bling(Confession of a King)He says \\"higher and higher\\" and you just want to jump up and start dancing.It took me a while to really feel this album.For any killers fan this album should live up to your expectations!!
B000929AJQ|4.0|Such a powerfull album. \\"The hand that feeds\\" is absolutley my favorite NIN song and the entire albom is as good.
B000EGDC0A|3.0|\\"SuperNature\\" is the follow - up to \\"Black Cherry\\".  Allison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory found a GREAT synth-pop sound with that album that I can't get enough of.  With \\"Supernature\\", they've found a formula that works, and BOY do they stick with it!  You can paralell almost every song on here with a similar song on \\"Black Cherry\\".  I was expecting a bit more growth in musical style, unfortunately.  Still, if you like this album, you'll like \\"Black Cherry\\" as well, and vice versa.  It's not like this is sitting on my shelf gathering dust!    One last thing:  Allison, dear, you are beautiful, have a terrific voice and have developed a great visual look to your group, but for your next album PLEASE HIRE A LYRICIST!  The poor attempts at forced rhymes often make me wince.  \\"Winnebego\\" and \\"Rabbit Stew\\" should never be used in any songs (unless you're into that country crap)!
B000N4S8RA|4.0|Biffy Clyro absolutley know what they are doing when they write music. Interesting album, I've listened to it 5 times in a row when I got it and still not sick of it. Highly recomanded!
0525950079|5.0|I loved 'World Without End', maybe slightly less than 'Pillars of the Earth', but all in all, I would say this is a worthy sequel to what is to me one of the greatest works of popular historical fiction ever.  Bravo, Ken Follett!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse are the best thing that happened to the music world in the 21st century. They have created something totally their own that no one can mimik, and this is their best so far. It doesn't matter how many times you listen to it, it keeps amazing you over and over again.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Marilyn Manson seems to get a big thumbs down from Metal fans, most saying its \\"Hot Topic Rock\\" or pop Nu metal, or its for teens that want to prove they are hardcore, and other ridiculous statements that I have heard. Sure its true that there are a ton of Nu Metal and pop Metal bands that I cannot stomach, and each sounds the same as the other, but I have to give Mariyln Manson credit where credit is due, Their (or his if you will) music is quite unique and I would classify it under a more industrial side of metal. Goth rock, Punk Rock, and NU Metal it aint. So I guess you can see what direction I am headed for this review as I about to give \\"Mechnical Animals\\" alot of praise. Manson's first two efforts \\"Portrait of an Amercian Family\\" and \\"Smells like Children\\" weren't very good albums. You could see the band had some creativity, but most of the tracks seemed flat and just so to say \\"Noisy\\" \\"AntiChrist Superstar\\" was good, a bit harder cleaner, but still \\"Mechnical Animals\\" is where Manson seemed to break through with more intelligent song wrting, and his band made a huge break-thru by actually showing that they had some talent behind all the noise. There are some that will probely argue that the first two albums were the best, since Manson wasnt well known, and I am sure the early fans will say he sold out, so to speak once \\"Anti-Christ Superstar\\" and \\"Mechnical Animals\\" started getting heavy rotation. For those that have been avoiding this album because they are already negitively influenced by past reviews or what Manson represents, I ask you to really try on this record. Even though Manson is no Trent from NIN, he still proves on this break-thru album that he can make his mark in industrial metal. This is a outstanding album, with very little filler. Please, once again, look past what the fanbase consist of(some of which only do it just to be different, or a phase, so to speak) and sit down and listen to this. It is just a great Metal album, and it just fallsshort of 5stars because of two not so good filler tracks, but thats not to bad out of fourteen songs. Try this if you are a fan of Metal, no matter what type, look past all the nonsense, you might just like it.
0440238609|2.0|I recently finished reading Pullman's \\"Golden Compass' in anticipation of the upcoming movie.  I was disappointed in the quality of the writing and the story itself.  I am a retired literature teacher and this book does not meet the quality of the works of Tolkien, C. S. Lewis or J.K.Rowling.  I found it depressing, the abuse of children was appalling and it seemed to have no redeeming features.  Instead of eagerly beginning the second book, I found myself drawn back to read again the Harry Potter books, which leave me with a much better feeling at the end, whichever book I may read.     I was surprised at the many awards the trilogy had received. There are many more books available for the young adult reader which are worthy of the time to read them.  This book, and I assume the series, are NOT for young children, and not really recommended for young adults.  More science fiction than fantasy, I am not sure I want to read the next two books, particularly when I hear that the first book is the best one.  I will probably see the movie since it is considered 'watered down' from the book.  Too much darkness in this book.
1592332803|4.0|I received your book, and so far, as always, i am pleasantly inspired and lifted up by your words,,, your deep philosophical views on what we should be doing as a species for all living Sentient Ones and our Plant World~ I also, already, find your book, for the lack of a better term,well constructed and easy to read,,, so far,,, haven't tried to do a recipe yet:)~<br /><br /> I truly appreciate all what you do with your Podcast and more, and someday hope to become as good a baker as you've apparently become so i don't have to buy things i had no part in creating like i could do myself at home, for i really dont feel good eating out (rarely ever) and also buying premade baked goods and food from stores~ I want to do it all myself now from scratch, ya know, so i know what went into it??<br /><br />Your husband must me the happiest man on earth or he should be!<br /><br />thank you!
B000UR366S|5.0|One of the best albums of the year.  A classic. The music is familiar and soothing.  The themes are about living in the world today and resonate emotionally.  With each listening a different song becomes a favorite. Should be nominated for a Grammy as best album. If only I had a heart I'd cry.....of joy of this surprising comeback from a true artist.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|I gotta confess that i have a lot of versions and variations and discs and collections and compilations of Zep's songs.  However, in my defense, i DID see them in concert once upon a time.  It was in mid-June 1972 at the San Diego Sports Arena.  I was 15 years old, just finished 10th grade cuz school had just gotten out for the summer and my whole world was nothing but endlessly wonderful possibilities.  That Zep concert was one of the best concerts i ever attended, and (all modesty aside) i was a major-league concert-going maniac back then.<br /><br />Then there was a year or two during my very early 20's when, far from home and terribly homesick, i couldn't go to sleep at night unless \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" (or Boston's \\"Dust In the Wind\\") was lulling me there via my trusy little red plastic portable tape deck.  I'll forever owe loyalty and homage to Led Zep for helping me get through that bleak time in my life.<br /><br />Finally, my now-19-year-old daughter discovered and began listening to Zep when she was about 15.  Because 15-year old kids can only hear music if it's turned up high (i remembered that from when i was 15), i had Zep's music around a lot again, and through the magic of a heart and soul just discovering it for the first time, too.  Watching her joy in this ageless, timeless, ever-appealling and compelling music helped me fall in love with it all over again.<br /><br />While i've learned that the song doesn't actually remain the same, it __does__ remain, and that's enough to get me here to fork out a fistful of cash in order to buy yet another \\"new\\" Led Zep Collector's Edition.<br /><br />That's my story and i'm sticking to it.<br />(-;
B00007AJF8|5.0|What can I say? It is a weird movie, but if that is your kind of humor, this is the classic movie for you. Tired of love stories, chick flicks or adventure. Do you want to watch a movie purely for fun? This is your kind of movie. I could not even find it at the Movie Rental Store. This not-so-well known gem is the kind of movie that attracts a certain special group of people who are fans of John Malkovich and his kind of off-beat characters. It grows on you. You have to watch it a few times to get it. Usually, that is.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|everything a sci fi should be. a little out there (as it should be) but has a great story line. can't wait for the next season.
B00005JPWF|5.0|Christopher McCandless is an intelligent, adventurous youth from an upper middle class but very dysfunctional family. After graduating from college, he adapts the moniker \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" and hits the road in search of self awareness and intense living. Raw wilderness is where he feels most at home as he tramps his way though the western United States and Mexico, places such as the Colorado River, Sea of Cortez and California desert. He builds several close friendships - with a South Dakota wheat farmer, an older hippie couple and an elderly man who has lost his family. But all these folks Alex eventually leaves behind to pursue his final destination - the Alaskan wilderness.    I am from the same generation as Alex (born exactly 5 days earlier) and shared similar experiences and ideals as a young person. Like him, I rejected the materialism and careerism of modern America and set off on a series of travel adventures. Of course, I was never so brave and/or foolish as to try to live by myself in the Alaskan wilderness. But still I can relate to his story. Now, as a 39 year old, married and with a steady job, I watched this movie with a mixture of head nodding and head shaking. Alex was selfish, arrogant and naive in many ways. But I still felt a sense of admiration for his courage, energy and spiritual longing. He wasn't willing to settle for the mediocrity of mainstream normality. But instead followed a path close to nature, as Henry David Thoreau, Jack London and others did in an earlier age. His was a uniquely American adventure and, whether wise or foolish, Alex certainly sought to live life to its fullest.    This movie has fine acting, beautiful cinematography of gorgeous natural landscapes and a great soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. But, ultimately, your reaction will probably depend on how you feel about Alex and his search for \\"ultimate freedom.\\"

0142403881|5.0|When I was a little girl, I remember being mesmerized by this enchanting story.  Naturally, when I grew up and looked for a story to read to my own children, I remembered this one.  My children loved it just as I did.  You come to love Charlie and Grandpa Joe.  The other children's flaws are as obvious as they can be from the very beginning; it is amazing to see each one fall prey to his own weeknesses.  The ending couldn't be more satisfying.  It is a dream come true!    It is also a story that leaves you longing for more.  I highly recommend this wonderfully enjoyable book to children and adults alike.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This film is rather slow in its build up, but like a great meal which has had hours lavished over it, from firstly buying all the ingredients then spending hours over the stove mixing and cooking. You finally sit down to eat 'mmm mmm, that tastes so darn good' quarter of an hour later you've finished your meal and you feel content. Unforgiven works in a similar way, the film spends large amounts of time bringing the story together, then the climax is short, but it gets me every time, it is so exciting. The film sets to dispel the old myths of the west - regarding cold hearted killers, and the only real cold hearted son of a gun isn't that cold hearted afterall.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Do you remember how you felt the first time that you heard The River? Do you remember what it's like to enjoy a good rock album from the first to last track? Magic can make you feel that way again. Amidst all the---insert euphemism here---\\"stuff\\" that's on radio and in music news today, it's refreshing to see and hear Bruce and The E Street Band again. This album has the usual well-crafted songs, rockers, and the colorful storytelling, but it's good to hear an upbeat album after Bruce and the band played with more serious overtones on The Rising, their previous album together.    The surprise track for me is \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes.\\" I've been a  Springsteen fan for over 20 years and I don't remember hearing Bruce croon and sound so smooth. This track exemplifies The Boss's vivid storytelling skills and evokes a time when things where much more innocent; such as the butterflies in the stomach that go along with early, breezy summer nights near the Jersey Shore (or any beach area of your choice) during your younger years---the perfect time and place to do some people watching or to cruise for some babes.    Regarding the production of the album: Other reviewers have noted that the mix is a little muddy, but I think it's fine in this case. In my humble opinion, the imperfect mix adds to the charm of the album. In contrast, I think a more polished, extremely clean sound could have made the album feel a bit overproduced. Bring on the muddy sound! To quote the Stones, \\"I know. It's only rock'n'roll and I like it!\\"    Don't pass on this album. It will not disappoint both old-time Springsteen fans and new ones. To answer, Bruce's plea and rally cry in the first track: We are here, Bruce. You (and Patti and the boys) can make us feel alive again. Thank you for another good album.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|It only took two plays to realize that this is one of the best albums ever from the boss and makes it only more frustrating to not be able to get tickets to see him live on the current tour due to unfair actions on the releasing of tickets and scalping by the ticket brokers.
0374105235|5.0|A sad but true story. Consider all the same problems he had and he was just a few years younger than most of our boys now fighting. Never fool yourself all the mental things that he experienced and told of effects most of our boys in the same way when they return from combat. Do keep it in mind as time advances that we will see some of the same hatreds and incorrect behaviour in the future. Remember this story.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|At the risk of facing the wrath of what appears to be a VERY LARGE group of fans, I have to say I didn't like this show that much.  I only watched the first disk as the second disk of the show was missing (seems I received a package with two disk 3s and was too late to return the set). If the show gets better, I apologise. But I felt I watched enough that I should have gotten hooked.<br /><br />Basically, what you've got here is a western. And, despite not liking westerns, I actually liked many westerns more than this show.<br /><br />Just one guy's opinion.<br /><br />UPDATE: Watched the rest of the series. If I'd had a chance to watch the show from the beginning, I think I might have rated it 3 1/2 stars and rounded up to 4. As it was defective, I'm staying with my 3 stars rounded down from 3 1/2.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|My family has always loved this film since it came out.  My Father is very much Robert Duvall, (Gus) in this film.  We have watched this film several times and never tire of it. If you love cowboys and the old west you will love this film.
072325804X|5.0|I have five children, and we love the world through Beatrix Potter's eyes.    After checking out each individual story numerous times, and even some of the DVDs, we finally broke down and bought the collection. We love the beautiful watercolor illustrations, and the British dialog and 19th century customs. I think my two particular favorite tales are The Fierce, Bad Rabbit, and the Pie and the Patty Pan. It was really hard to choose just two.     It's fun to sit down and just start reading from this collection of stories.  In no time, we had read them all, and children were pushing to hear their favorite story first.      Every now and then, someone will quote one of the stories, saying something silly like, \\"someone's been digging up MY nuts,\\" or \\"Gammon, ha-ha...\\" You really have to read the stories to know what we're talking about.  It's a way to create a secret culture of inside jokes with your family.      This is definitely one of my 10 favorite children's books.
0375842209|5.0|From the disconcerting opening pages to the heartbreaking but uplifting conclusion, I found this book remarkable -- and that's coming from a very picky English teacher.  I finished it a week ago but still have it on my mind.  The author's choice of Death as the narrator is intriguing and thought-provoking and to me had the odd effect of making Death less terrifying.  Liesel, her foster parents, and all of the other characters became real to me as people, and that is something I value highly in a novel.      Holocaust literature is grim by its very nature, and the author does not gloss over reality.  But the story has so many uplifting moments that one finishes the book with hope for humanity, or at least for the human spirit.    I truly loved this book!  It will be a \\"keeper,\\" along with SUITE FRANCAISE and SOPHIE'S CHOICE.
0451529308|5.0|When I started reading this to my children,  I had to read ahead. Soon I had finished reading it to me, but not to them! My oldest has since read it. I liked this book so much better than Little Men and Jo's Boys. Girls coming of age really strike a chord with me. I wish I'd discovered these as a girl!    I would highly recommend this classic for girls and women alike.  The stories are engaging enough for boys as well, if they can get past the title. :) It definitely belongs on my list of my 10 favorite children's books of all time.

She changed so many people's lives, and turned so many hearts just by thinking about things for which to be grateful. The book is much better than the Disney movie. I also loved [[ASIN:0140367586 Pollyanna Grows Up (Puffin Classics)]]    These books definitely belong among my 10 favorite children's books of all time.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|Donnie Darko is an excellent movie in the original theatrical release. It has some ambiguous imagery and plot twists that engage the viewer and will cause discussion after watching the movie the first time. After a second (or even third) viewing, you will understand nuances missed the first time around.    The director's cut adds unnecessary material that breaks the flow of the story and detracts significantly from most viewers' final impression of the movie and what it was about.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Cinematic verbosity is a poison to be served in small amounts if at all. So, half of this movie is dialog (yawn). Even when it's good dialogue (yawn), we expect a Tarantino punch. When the punch comes, its superb. Instead of talking (yawn) why not follow up on side plots, like what happened to Lee after her friends left her alone with the owner of the white car? And where did that motorcyclist come from and what happened to him? And why didn't the girls use that iron bar some more? But I loved the second hour and earns the movie its 5 star credit.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio's threat is among one of the more genteel moments in BLOOD DIAMOND, a ruthlessly realistic, almost documentary-like film exposing the horrifying world of conflict diamonds in the west African nation of Sierra Leone.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a white Zimbabwean (or as he insists, \\"Rhodesian\\") diamond smuggler and soldier of fortune who is seeking a 100 carat rose colored raw diamond discovered by an enslaved diamond digger. Strictly for the selfish reason of finding the stone, Archer helps the man, Solomon Vandy, to escape, and together, they seek Vandy's scattered family and the diamond even while being hunted by all three sides in Sierra Leone's hideous civil war, the Sierra Leone government, the rebels, and troops of white mercenaries who veer between roles as protectors, liberators and pirates with evil ease.<br /><br />Archer and Vandy's odyssey is marked by all the nightmares of the conflict: rape squads, child soldiers, slavery, random pointless slaughter and destruction, and mayhem mutilation as punishment. The unfortunate victims had hands, feet, limbs, their tongues or their eyes removed for any reason at all or no reason at the whim of whatever group was choosing to victimize them.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly plays an American journalist reporting on the stories of this largely unknown killing field. The beautiful Connelly plays her role convincingly, but she's an insufficient distraction against a backdrop in which almost no one seems to have a higher motive than their own greed, their own survival, or their own aggrandizement.<br /><br />BLOOD DIAMOND is masterfully made and presented, but it suffers from an overly formulaic approach, constantly reminding the viewer that the conflict diamond genocide is an important issue. This is a \\"message\\" movie, and while it IS an important message, the viewer is left both ultimately troubled and impotent. Yes, this is a horror . . . but it seems there's nothing we can do.<br /><br />As Connelly says at one moment: \\"Why would I risk my story just to help a single person . . . ? I can't believe I said that.\\" Sadly enough for our own humanity, that is the moral of BLOOD DIAMOND in a sentence or less.y would I risk my story just to help a single person . . . ?

B000W9MMPU|5.0|What a great deal for all 3 HD DVD's, under $20 each. 11 is a modern classic, 12 is a lot of fun, and 13 is another delightful classic in the vein of the first. A great trilogy of fun movies- these aren't monumental motion pictures, they are fluff, they are fun, and I'll have this on my shelf for years to come.
B000LC4TJ0|2.0|I, too, wish I hadn't wasted my money on this recording which I bought having seen Anna Netrebko in L'Elisir d'Amor. But for Le Nozze di Figaro I much prefer the Peter Hall Glyndebourne production with Kiri Te Kenawa as the Countess, although Netrebko's acting was worth watching in the Salzburg production. The introduction of the cherub distracts from the music, the camera, and viewer, spent more time watching that ridiculous character than attending to the music. The cherub seems to have been introduced to entertain jaded Salzburg habitués who have seen this opera too many times already and clamour for novelty for its own sake.
B000VI6T6K|5.0|Look, I know there's Hendrix fans who have the Reprise release of this from 1986 or possibly the 1970 edited Hendrix/Redding combo.  But hey, some people have gotten into Hendrix in between the Alan Douglas/Reprise/Experience Hendrix blowout of the early 90's which killed a lot of great Hendrix/Reprise releases...Stages, Lifelines, Concerts.  Okay, we can do without \\"Nine\\" and \\"Midnight\\" because those sucked.      In their places post 1995 we've gotten basically overused-univibe Jimi with a lagging Mitchell and a bored Redding or having Cox drowned out by Jimi. Heck, they'll release Berkeley and four or five other sub-par gigs but not San Diego 1969 which blows the doors off of everything since Monterey...plus still no Monterey anyway?  And where's Winterland, by the way?  Oh, I forgot...Hendrix's family in their infinite wisdom - Jimi Drink showed their \\"skills\\", I might add - killed Ryko's Hendrix releases as well. Like Ryko was a major force to be dealt with or something.      All these things said, I'm glad they've released Monterey again.  I lost my 1986 copy in 1991 and have been looking for a new copy since.  Plus, the Wild Thing mix on 2002's Voodoo Child was much better than the 1986 mix, let alone the Hendrix/Redding 1970 thing.  And think of how many new Hendrix fans since the mid 90's who've picked up either beat up used 1986 Monterey off the internet, probably one of them was once mine, or some tanked bootleg off a torrent site.      Stop whining and be glad they're releasing it to properly and triggering newer fans and us morons who lost our 1986's to get an official Monterey release currently in circulation.      Five stars.
0743277457|5.0|The overall concept of Josh's book reminds me of \\"The Books of Five Spheres\\", which is, applying the study of one concept to any other.  Just as Musashi demonstrated how the techniques of swordsmanship apply to the carpenter, Waitzkin has thoroughly analyzed his mastery of chess and martial arts and discusses how any person can master any subject.<br /><br />  This volume is more philosophic digest than factual manual, which is apt for the title \\"art\\" rather than \\"science\\".  Perhaps the most important subject to first master is the self, and I feel Josh's outlook is flawless.  He provides new insight on the subconscious mind, which is still misunderstood and understated in current mainstream psychology, as well documented by Gladwell's \\"Blink\\".  Waitzkin's conclusions are correct, proper, and thus, enlightening.

B00005JKLZ|5.0|Of all the sci-fi movies I've seen, there remain three that are of my favorites or should I say most favorites:  1. The Time Machine, 2. Contact, and 3. Aliens 2.  I can't say which one is the best, neither can I arrange them in order of excellence. They are all very good, each in its own way.  I'll review them all,separately.    This movie is very exciting to watch and it has a very sad episode in it to break your heart.  Guy Pearce is Professor Alexander Hartdegen, he is also an extraordinary inventor, the Time Machine that is.  The machine was invented for the purpose of adventure, I think, but in the end he tried to use it to undone a personal tragedy.  I'll refrain from saying what kind of personal tragedy.  To his dismay and disappointment, he found out that he couldn't change history; I don't know about you but it broke my heart to watch him go through it.  He then, went farther into the future and at the second stop he was at the time of a worldwide calamity, the moon cracked, I don't remember what was the cause.  New York was in a chaotic situation, the soldiers tried to force the professor to a safe place but he broke away and ran into his machine and banged his head and accidentally pressed on the time button and passed out.  The machine kept running rapidly into the future until about eight hundred thousand years later.  During this long period of time, the surface of the earth has changed drastically due to climatic violence, I guess.  When he came back to his senses he found out that the world was still very beautiful,even the severed moon looked strangely beautiful, but only on the surface.  He found out soon enough that the nice, friendly people, especially the girl who came upon him and saved him and nursed him have been helplessly preyed on by some evil force.  You'll have to pardon me for having to refrain from telling you what kind of evil force.  Some type of movies or many movies, it is better that some important parts of the plots are better left for you to find out for yourselves.    I feel the insignificance of the human race watching this movie.  It is really how I always feel about life or being a human being anyway.  Men cannot control fate, the environment, or even their own emotions at times.  despite some cocky or conceited characters always claim that we hold fate in our hands, do what we want with it.  Well, wait till you board on a plane that is going to crash, or hit by a car crossing the street, even when walking on the footpath.    Let me come back from the detour, Guy Pearce is excellent as the noble and gallant great inventor. I am not sure you can find someone with all these supreme qualities rolled into one person in real life, on top of that professor Alexander Hartdegen is quite handsome and sexy, with a physique too, how can I not admire him.  Of course the world of 800,000 years from now is a completely new and exciting story.  Jeremy Iron is also very good as a creature that has evolved into a species other than human, with a back somewhat like a fish but not quite, and he has super natural power that can infiltrate the mind of people, and make them dream what he dictates.  He can also read mind so that he knows all about the professor's past.  Nevertheless, good prevailed over evil at the end.  The professor defeated the evil creature and saved the helpless people.  He used the time machine to destroy the evil force completely.  In spite of that everything had to be started from the beginning because the people were illiterate, I gather.  Never fear, the people have the professor, he'll be able to build everything from scratch.    I love a happy ending.      Best line in the picture:  \\"It's only a machine\\", the reply from the professor when the girl of his future mate said, \\"Sorry about the machine\\".  The machine was destroyed togather with the underground world.
B000UR9T82|5.0|Don't listen to the HD DVD fanboys, the Spider-Man trilogy release on blu-ray is going to be one of the biggest releases ever on any format.  Sony has a record of putting uncompressed audio on most of their releases, so expect this one to look AND sound great!
B00012FXAE|5.0|I don't usually care for monster movies; I hate ugly things.  Watching repulsive creatures of otherworldliness eating, killing, tearing, tormenting human beings just isn't my cup of tea.  But, I'll put an exception for Sigourney Weaver, my female Rambo heroine with a mother instinct and motherly love. She braves dreadful danger went into the monster den that littered with hundreds of monster eggs to save the little girl who is trapped in a cocoon weaved by one of the monsters. The queen monster is right there in the den laying eggs like crazy.  The female Rambo manages to save the girl and destroys a lot of eggs with her fire machine gun.  Of course, in the end she succeeded in saving the girl and Michael Biehn who was out with injury and the upper half of the humanoid who said to her, \\"Not bad for a human\\".    James Cameron, the director of this film and numerous other box office hits schi-fi's cleverly arranges the introduction of an instrument at the beginning that functions as a life saving weapon at the end.  Sigourney gives her best in this one.  I also saw 'Alians 1' but there is nothing to compare to this one. I haven't seen the sequels 3 & 4 and don't plan to.  But don't miss this one, it's action packed and with a good story.
0575081392|5.0|Let me start off by stating that I can't be objective about this book. I love it. I go around ranting about it to glassy-eyed friends who really don't give a care. But  understand that I didn't start off like this- I read rave reviews and had to see for myself, and I wanted to find a reason *not* to like it. I didn't do very well in that respect, and am now a convert.    So, now that's out of the way...    I like this book for the usual reasons. I like the plot- it can be seen as an orphan-solving-his-mysterious-past story, or boy-meets-girl drama, or child-wizard/rags-to-riches story. Whatever. In any case, it's pretty good. I wanted to know what would happen next, is the point. And the fantasy world is pretty interesting- the book even includes a map of Rothfuss' invented world. Neato!    Why I love the book is a different matter. The Name of the Wind is full of the miniature of life in the world in which it is set. The characters eat and sleep and sit exams and get annoyed or bored or punished. But the everyday, perfectly relatable bits are interspersed with elements of the imaginary background in which the story is set. Fragments of poetry, nursery rhymes and foreign language pop up. Magic is a mundane scholarly pursuit that must be studied tediously. A library of infinitely desirable books lies just out of the protagonist's reach.    The blending of the fantastic and the mundane is why I really love this book. I can relate to characters whose lives are set in a world that doesn't exist, yet seems perfectly plausible. Kvothe is especially compelling, a mixture of swaggering bravado and gnawing self-doubt that most of us would be familiar with.    So I recommend you buy this book and read it. But who am I to judge? 
0790733226|5.0|Whenever I have a chance to look at the open clear skies at night, I always have a tingling sensation and wonder what do we have out there in this vastness, are there intelligent living things like us or even much superior than us out there.  It would be rather preposterous to presume that we're the only living thing existed in the whole universe.  As it is so well put in the movie that 'It would be such a waste, wouldn't it?'  This is why I am so fond of Jodie Foster's character in the movie; from a very young age, she is fascinated with the idea of receiving messages from intelligent living thing from outer space.  She has the support from her father but; unfortunately, he died when she is still very young. However, her interest remains unchanged and goes on to pursue her ambition and graduated with a doctorate in her desired field.  She has to go through adverse situations before she got her financial support from a prominent industrialist played by John Hurt.  She finally succeeded in receiving messages from a faraway place.  The messages she received is to build a machine but it is in code that no one can decipher.  Just as the hope of deciphering the blueprint is in vain, the industrialist summons her to his private plane and conveys the decoded chart to her.    You can imagine the discovery of this magnitude when made known to the world, what kind of commotion it would create.  From this climatic moment on there is no dull moment. You see the ambitious contest and opportunistic seizure by some scientist to gain recognition and the right to ride in the spacecraft, the wacky religious cultist and his bent on destruction, and all kinds of outlandish demonstrations of human irrational reactions.  In the end Jodie Foster gets to ride the spacecraft.    I don't want to spoil the fun of watching the movie yourselves, therefore, I'll leave it right here.  I guess I'm not the only one who got a kick out of the line 'Wanna take a ride' spoken by John Hurt in the movie.There is one reviewer who put it as his title.    Contrary to the famous critic of a worldwide fame weekly magazine who ridiculed the movie as being shallow, I think instead, it is very imaginative and has a profound sense of the unknown.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|To hear Chloe, Hayley, Lisa, Mairead, Meav and Orla even once is to understand why the Ladies of `Celtic Woman' have spent 100+ weeks in the #1 position of the music charts. To see them against the background of historic Slane Castle, the site of musical concerts going back decades, is a treat to the senses far better experienced than described.   From their introductory collective `The Sky and the Sea and the Sun' through the evocative `You Raise Me Up' they carry the viewer as a participant on a magical tour that will have even the most jaded coming back for more.   Mairead: If you have only heard this powerhouse on CD you might imagine she performs standing still; nothing could be further from the truth! This dynamic sprite seems to fly across the multi-level stage, performing with boundless enthusiasm that draws the audience in from her first instants and holds them for a stunning collection of performances. This All Ireland Fiddle Champion makes the difficult appear easy; her `Granvaile's Dance' is a joyous romp that will leave you breathless; her every appearance carries with it a boundless energy that sweeps the stage and audience in staggering counterpoint to the stately moves of her companions, while her counter punctual `Shenandoah' and `Pacific Slope' showcase her talent and must be seen to be appreciated.   Chloe's `The Prayer' will move you to tears; her melodious voice carries a fine depth of emotion, while her rendition of `Panis Angelicus' is equally at home in a towering cathedral or small chapel.   When Lisa sings `I don't know if you can see the changes that have come over me' she is telling us more than her longing for `Caledonia'; to look at her is to understand the biggest change of all. Filmed in August 2006, this delightful lady was expecting a great gift indeed. (#3 is due in March 2008, which is one reason she is resting during the American tour.) The longing she conveys in `Caledonia' is poignant, while her `Blessing' is filled with suchlove you feel she is speaking directly to you.   As Orla tells us of `Newgrange' she brings us back to the days of Druids and mystic Temples, her stunning voice carrying us willingly to a world of past glory. Fluent in Gaelic, as are several of the others, many of her performances are in that evocative language; you do not really need to know the words to be carried by the feeling (though [...] does provide translations). Her `Carrickfergus', when she accompanies herself on the Irish Harp, carries such emotion you long to be with her to its sad end.   Meav's `Dulaman' is just one of the Gaelic renditions which this stunning lady brings out in all its beauty so well that you do not need to know the story of love to be swept along by it. `Danny Boy' never fails to arouse emotion and she carries heartache and longing with a voice that fills the room and the heart.   Hayley's crystal voice brings new depth to familiar favorites such as `Scarborough Fair' while her `Lascia Ch'io Pianga' evokes heartache and the longing for true love.   Their multitude of varying combinations not only showcase their ability to work as a team but carries their individuality as well. Even when singing in chorus each lady's voice can be heard, more a cooperative effort that one of being subsumed into the whole.    The delight these ladies bring to their performances brings you into the scene with them, but whether collectively or individually there is no `Lead Performer'; whether through the wistfulness of `Over the Rainbow' or the joyousness of `Sing Out' or the unabashed sexiness of `At the Ceilli' or `Spanish Lady', they are Celtic Woman.
B0000027F3|4.0|\\"This IS the PAINKILLER\\"...So claimed the title track of Priest's comeback album. After the creative nadir of the `Twin Turbos' project, Judas Priest limped into the Nineties without a hint of the aural assault that they would produce to open the decade.  Straddling both the American thrash brigade led by Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer and hair metal, Priest seemed to be at a crossroads and threatened with irrelevancy. In stepped new drummer Scott Travis (a Yank!) who became the catalyst for the band's best example of technical brilliance combined with ferocious assault since the late Seventies. Travis' brilliant double bass speed metal playing completely energized the legendary duo of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing to create their most brutal riffs and stunning leads to date. In addition, the greatest voice in metal was in top form - Robert Halford, who sang as if possessed by the fires of hell. `Painkiller' would be their best album since `Screaming for Vengeance' as the band seemed to wipe away most of their mid to late Eighties mediocrity.  However, it was not as many fans and critics would have you believe, their best record.  Though the music was definitely killer, the lyrical content was of the same clichéd territory as much of their `80's material.  Faves include the title track which without a doubt belongs in the sacred pantheon of metal recordings and is easily one of the band's greatest triumphs! It stands as both a call to arms and a statement of intent (move over young guns, this is how the masters do it).  Others such as \\"All Guns Blazing\\", \\"Metal Meltdown\\", \\"Night Crawler\\" and \\"Leather Rebel\\" show Priest at the top of the game. Unfortunately a four star album is not five stars and `Painkiller' is let down by the much of the last half of the record. Technically flawless songs with lame lyrics include \\"Hammer and Anvil\\", \\"One Shot at Glory\\" and \\"Touch of Evil\\" (never quite dug this one). All good songs yes but again not great ones.  `Painkiller''s legacywill rest one the monstrous title track and the fact that at least temporarily it brought Priest back as a REAL metal band. Alas, it prove to be an end to an era as Halford left the band soon after the supporting tour and Judas Priest would be on hiatus for much of the rest of the decade...until Ripper showed up...but the magic was still missing...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Whatever you pay for this series, it's definitely worth it. The shots they used in these episodes are overwhelmingly jaw dropping. You get to see things you'd never think you'd see. I'm glad I purchased the entire series. Some day we may never have the beautiful images provided here and this would make any kid fall in love with nature and all it's beauty.
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|With each new album, Rihanna's star seems to get higher and higher. While her latest album Good Girl Gone Bad isn't classic material, there are still enough good moments to find on here.<br /><br />amerdale876's review is pretty accurate, but in any case, I'm wondering if the title of this album comes from the fact that Rihanna has gone back to wearing provocative attire (or sometimes, nothing at all -- check the \\"Umbrella\\" video at the second chorus; man, Chris Applebaum has got to be the luckiest guy in the WORLD!) ...(*clearing throat*) Anyway, speaking of that, that song became a #1 hit for good reason, but I don't quite understand why Jay-Z is credited as a guest star when all he's doing is talking at the beginning of the song. Oh, well; the singles are actually the best songs, like \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" and the Ne-Yo duet \\"Hate That I Love You\\".<br /><br />That's not to say the rest of the songs are skippable. In fact, the last three songs are the most innovative: \\"Rehab\\" (supposedly featuring Justin Timberlake, because I don't remember hearing him in the song), \\"Question Existing\\" and the title track. But there are a couple of songs that I CAN do without. \\"Say It\\" lazily uses Mad Cobra's \\"Flex\\" as a backdrop, and \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" almost had me breakin' my fast-forward button.<br /><br />Everything else is okay, but when it all comes down to it, if Rihanna really wants that classic release, maybe she should stop churning out an album every year. This is far from being a bad album, but huge fans of Rihanna will enjoy it best while everyone else will probably just say it's aiight.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000059TEQ|5.0|The last time I saw \\"Love Story\\" was on a network showing circa 1976 on the family black-and-white when I was twelve and my sister was thirteen.  What do you know about love at that age but my sister was all blubbery.  I've just celebrated my first wedding anniversary with my wife and I wanted to get her a quintessential romance flick so why not but...\\"Love Story\\".  Unless you've never been in love or are inherently cynical you can't appreciate how this film captures the experience of being totally immersed in another person.  The film's catchphrase, \\"Love means never having to never say your sorry\\" doesn't seem that corny.  Even the film's tragic conclusion doesn't seem contrived or manipulative.  I think it helps that the film's stars, Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw, have kinetic chemistry even though I believe they were married to others at the time(MacGraw was married to Paramount honcho Robert Evans).  An interesting dichotemy here is how the film presents O'Neal and MacGraw's fathers.  O'Neal is saddled with a rich controlling father (Ray Milland) whereas MacGraw's father (John Marley) is a widower and MacGraw kind of assumes the spousal role in her relationship to him.  Now I don't know if that explains the attraction between the two leads but it's interesting food for thought.  \\"Love Story\\" kind of get's short shrift these days, dismissed by some as more of a dated cultural phenomenon than a great film, which is a shame.  \\"Love Story\\" is a film where you have to shed your reservations or inhibitions and accept it for what it is.
B000TGQDZQ|3.0|This CD has some absolutely beautiful moments..<br /><br />But \\"Living A Lie\\" is the only song that doesn't need editing.<br />There the growls complement and add so much to the music.<br /><br />Yet the awful screeching + drum pounding appears in every other song.<br />Its so disruptive to his music, I have to edit or delete them.<br /><br />Also the 14:00 minute 'epic' is a waste. You can tell he spent all his time on the intro, intermission and outro, the other 9 minutes are generic bunk!<br /><br />Like all brilliant minds, Mark Jansen has an idiosyncrasy. I just wish he had an editor.  Consign to Oblivion was his best song (edited). Phantom Agony was his best album.

B00003CXC7|5.0|This was the first Hitchock movie I ever saw and it's still my favorite. Grace Kelly is as gorgeous as ever in this movie. Thelma Ritter is a great sidekick to Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart, the Hitcock regular. Hitchock creates a great set of neighbors for Jimmy Stewart to watch.     I couldn't wait to see the ending the first time and I still love the final scenes. I could watch this over and over. The restored movie looks great.    Definitely one of Hitchock's best movies since you know the crime at the beginning and just wait for it's climax. Law & Order probably got some inspiration from this film (LOL).
B000026OW3|5.0|Nothing needs to be said really.  Arthur Rubenstein (and Horowitz) is the greatest pianist of the 20th Century.  His forte is romantic music and almost solely the complete works of Chopin.  Rubenstein is to the piano what Heifetz is to the violin.  A word of advice.  Never listen to a Chopin recording unless it is Arthur Rubenstein.  I'm dead serious!!

0374105235|5.0|A Long Way Gone was such an amazing book about the testament and will of a young man who, through even the toughest odds, succeeded to fulfill his destiny of helping others through his own words and past.  I am not a big fan of reading, but one day at Starbuck's I noticed this book on their bookshelf and read the back of it to get the synopsis.  I didn't buy the book then, but I continued to think about it from time to time.  And one day I decided that I was going to order it and I don't regret it.  Ishmael Beah does an amazing job of describing the events that terrorized him and his family, and although some of the reading his difficult and graphic, it only adds to the strong conviction he now feels against children and war.  Through such haunting odds, Ishmael eventually forgives himself for what he had done and grows to love not only himself but the world he now lives in today.  I would suggest this book to anyone, and I already have to several individuals.
B00005J6UP|2.0|Our family only watches G and PG movies. (We have a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old.) A friend bought this movie for our kids and we were watching it with her. From the start my husband and I were uncomfortable with the sexual-themed language and 4-letter words, but we kept watching for a little while out of courtesy to our friend. But 10 minutes into the film she began to exchange glances with us, and we all agreed it was totally inappropriate for our kids' ages, and switched to another more appropriate film. I'm not sure that kind of gratuitous language is ever appropriate, but definitely not for the PG crowd. I wish filmmakers didn't think 4-letter words and adult themes were appropriate in kids' movies. Filmmakers must live in a different world than most Americans do. Sure, there are some parents who are okay with this kind of material, but those are the parents that are okay with PG-13 or older material. Please don't slap a PG label on this level of inappropriateness!
0316166685|5.0|I just finished reading The Lovely Bones for the third (possible fourth?) time. This time I read it because it had been assigned for my Junior AP American Lit. course, which I thought to be a rather strange pick for an actual class. The Lovely Bones, while being a beautiful novel, did not strike me as something school-friendly because of the violence and shock-factor of the first hundred pages of the book.       I read this book for the first time when I was 13 (which horrified my mother). Every time I read it, one thing stays the same - I cannot stop crying for the first fifty-odd pages, and at other points during the novel. While I would suggest that this novel is certainly not for those looking for an emotionally light right, I will also say that to not read this novel is to do yourself a disservice. Yes, it will upset you quite a bit, and yes, if you are a parent it might worry you a little about your own daughter's safety. However, the protagonist's voice and Sebold's narrative powers are stunning - this is not the book that you read and then put down and don't think about again, it stays with you, and I do not say that about anything lightly.        While I found the Lovely Bones powerful the past few times I read it, it was this time that I found it to be the most powerful. I think that as you get older and can truly understand the depth of grief, this book touches you in more and deeper ways. All of the characters are flawed and each deals with grief in their own captivatingly human way. I have heard others who read this claim that the protagonist's voice was too juvenile or that the storyline was trite. I would have to say that while Suzy Salmon is fourteen, her narrative is anything but juvenile - it is matter-of-fact and cathartic, not childlike, and hers is a voice that will resonate with people of all ages.         Anyways, I didn't mean for this review to be so long, but in closing, I would have to say that this is a must read. Believe me, I haveread a LOT of books, and I have found this to be the best one of read (right up there with East of Eden, and that's saying a lot!).
032147404X|5.0|This is quite simply the best photography \\"how-to\\" book I've ever read.  Not only does it read easily, it also has a little humor.  Most important it is not full of a lot of technical gobbledy-gook.  Scott Kelby himself best describes this book on Page 2: \\"if we were out shooting and you turned to me and said, 'Hey Scott, I want to take a shot where that flower over there is in focus, but the background is out of focus. How do I do that?' I wouldn't turn to you and give you a speech about smaller and larger apertures, about how exposure equals shutter speed plus aperture, or any of that stuff.....I'd just turn to you and say 'Put on your zoom lens, set your aperture at f/2.8, focus on the flower, and fire away.\\"  The entire book is written that way.  Buy it.  You'll love it!
1932100660|5.0|The research detailed in this book should not be ignored. I don't know how it hasn't become common knowledge. Hopefully that will change soon!     This book prompted changes in me that I thought I could never achieve, but knowing how unhealthy animal products REALLY are for you is a pretty good motivator. Since eliminating animal products from my diet I have never felt better. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate Dr. Campbell and his son writing this book. I have been buying copies from my family members and trying to spread the word. I hope that others do the same. This is shout-it-from-the-rooftops kind of information!

0440238609|5.0|Let me start by saying that I love this trilogy. My friends love this trilogy. Even my father loves this trilogy. It surprises me that something could appeal to so many age groups and walks of life. How does it accomplish this?<br /><br />First, the plot is spectacular. So much so that I don't even know how to sum it up in a convincing description. In The Golden Compass, a young girl must escape from those who would seek to control and with her with her daemon (magical companion that reflects your soul and position in the world)at her side flee to safety. She meets many strange and wonderful people and saves and armored bear that then helps her free children whose daemons are being severed from them in an attempt to stop coming of age and thus a knowledge of sin. Phew. It may sound over-the-top or far too strange to understand, bu Philip Pullman makes it all work perfectly. The world is well-crafted so that every piece of the story fits together and is completely believable.<br /><br />The characters are also wonderful and relatable. You'll be rooting for Lyra (the main girl) from the beginning. All the characters and creatures introduced have wonderful and fully-developed personalities. And one of the greatest things about this book is that every character has varied motivations. The strict line between good and evil drawn in so many fantasy stories is missing here. Everyone has some of both and is trying to do what he or she believes in. Pullman also does not force entire races into either good or evil descriptors. Armored bears and witches can be both and even the evil creatures of the underworld have very understandable desires.<br /><br />The second book continues in the same vein, introducing a second main character and more magical and wonderful ideas. I don't want to describe it to much, except to say that Pullman does it again. New ideas are introduced and old ideas are furthered, and once more, we root for the characters with all we've got.<br /><br />Let me preface my description of the third book by saying that some Christians may be offended by this book, but while it seems to be anti-religious, if you read closely enough, you'll find that it truly is not. Really Pullman is just telling a story of a corrupt religious organization that is attempting to extend its power too far. I think most people would admit that at some time or another the church has had corrupt officials within. While Pullman does this, he also promotes deep spirituality and overtones of a greater power and the wonder of the world. He is not trying to slam religion. Instead he is merely telling a tale.<br /><br />Furthermore, though this stories may be great for young teenagers (I read them for the first time at that age), they are wonderful for all age groups. There are intricacies that will intrigue the most well-read reader, and the characters and language never cease to amaze. So please, do not be offended and do not write these books off as children's tales. There is much, much more to them.<br /><br />The third book has the most fantastic plot of all; it ties everything together beautiful and all the characters come together in one final attempt at good. This is one of the most epic events in any fantasy story ever, for the climax of the plot of the trilogy involved people from the entire multiverse, I suppose you would call it. The wonderful thing about this is that while the plot climaxes at one place to satisfy those who love a spectacular climax, the characters have their climax later to satisfy those who love a character study. I know that both made me extremely happy.<br /><br />These books are well-crafted and follow an ingenious and inventive plot. The characters are well-developed. You understand the motives of both the good and the evil. The trilogy is a great read for anyone who loves a fantastic (in all the senses of the word) story.third book by saying that some Christians may be offended by this book, but while it seems to be anti-religious, if you read closely enough, you'll find that it truly is not.

B000TX7B5U|5.0|When I first heard Empty Walls and Unthinking Majority, I expected an album that went back to System's roots.  Although that was not the case, what Serj has done is nothing but monumental.  His creativity and lyrical accentricism is on par with nothing he's done in the past.  There is seriousness as well as subtle moments of sarcasm and humor through his vocal inflections and hectic tempo.<br />My favorite song by far at this point is Honking Antelope.  The music itself is just killer and unbelievable.  It's nice to imagine what the future might hold when System gets back together.<br />The only thing missing is the extensive guitar work that Daron's so well known for, and one can only hope their future reunification will completely transcend anything they've done or can imaginably do in the future.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I am really enjoying this record. Rush has reinvented their sound many times over their career, and this album is in the Vapor Trails line. If you liked Vapor Trails (its immediate predecessor) you will like this one. I absolutely love the VT style and the many ways that Rush achieved such a dark and heavy sound on that album. Snakes is similarly powerful and rich, but where VT adhered to some strict rules (no guitar solos, no guitar chorus-type effects, no synthesizers) this album relaxes those standards just a bit. With Vapor Trails, Rush dropped their long-standing practice of limiting overdubs so that their live sound could reproduce the studio sound faithfully. Snakes does the same thing and even goes a little farther in some ways. It is not quite so dark emotionally speaking but still handles some serious topics and in general shares with VT a starkly realistic worldview; one can easily detect Peart's famous advocacy of reason as the best philosophy. Snakes also features three awesome instrumentals, one of which is a tasty acoustic 12-string guitar solo.

B00005JPRD|5.0|Definitely one of the best films of the year! Besides the terrific Beatles songs, I loved the acting (especially Jim Sturgess who portrayed Jude and Evan Rachel Wood who portrayed Lucy), directing, writing and the trippy yet stunning cinematography. Some people may not like this movie because 1) it takes liberty at rearranging the Beatles songs, 2) it makes the \\"key\\" war protesters look like villains, and 3) it makes middle Americans look like idiots. But if you look at this movie for what it's worth--then you just may like it. I liked the love story angle in the movie between Jude and Lucy. I also liked how it was saying that drugs and protest riots may have started out with good intentions but then got sidetracked into being something destructive and terribly harmful to society. I remember George Harrison once saying how disappointed he was after he witnessed the Haight/Asbury Street scene in San Francisco because the whole concept of experimenting with drugs to free your mind was lost. It seemed that most hippies were taking drugs not to lead a better life but to get wasted. Finally, I also liked the whole theme of love in the film because that's what the Beatles songs were essentially about. I highly recommend this movie. It's too bad that the Academy Awards may not be openminded enough to nominate it for Best Picture. To me, this was a far better picture or musical than CHICAGO.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|I love Annie Lennox. Her voice. Her music. Her persona.<br /><br />So why am I not 100% overjoyed at 'Songs of Mass Destruction'? Maybe it's producer Glen Ballard - let's face it, the man can do wonders (Alanis' 'Jagged Little Pill') or schlock ('Wilson Phillips').  The man has no consistent track record.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - Lennox is in fine voice and her keyboard work is better than good - but the songs aren't resonating with me. Sure, some of them are, and overall, it's an ok to good disk. .....which is still better than 98.8% of the crap that is out there. And it certainly is better than her last one - 'Bare'.<br /><br />I am starting with the weakest song: \\"Sing\\". Ugh. Yes, the premise is done with a noble and good cause, but isn't she just pandering by having back-up vocals by Fergie (!) and other people of lesser or no-talent (umm....did I mention Fergie?). Only Madonna has prominent part in this song - and I'm not saying that's a good thing. Did no one listen to how weak her vocals are compared to a powerhouse like Lennox? Sad sad sad.<br /><br />Womanhood is the theme of the record. It is mentioned in at least four songs - and the title of one of them.<br /><br />But fear not - there is good stuff on here. \\"Ghost in My Machine\\" is far and away the best song on the disk. There is a rockin' cajun accordian thing going on there than more than makes the song a stand-out.<br /><br />\\"Dark Room\\" did not immediately hit with me, but after multiple listens it is a pretty strong track. But an initial single? It's a hard sell for airplay, but let's face it, the days of Lennox getting on the radio are slim. She's not a tween in a Disney movie or isn't public fodder for websites. She has no 'Grey's Anatomy' tie-ins. How else does one get on the radio these days? Not with quality product, that's for sure.<br /><br />What I've loved about Lennox's music is that even though she is so identifiable with the Eurythmics, she has been able to forge her own solo path. Here she doesn't shy away from some of her early '80s influences. Check out \\"Coloured Bedspread\\". Very 'Touch'-esque.<br /><br />Some other songs could have been lifted off her first solo disk, 'Diva'....and that is not a bad thing. \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" and \\"Love is Blind\\" are extremely solid efforts.<br /><br />I do not regret the purchase one little bit. As I write this, I zero in on the reason it's not an outstanding album. For a woman who for 20+ years continually broke ground as an artist and never/rarely repeated herself - I don't hear anything earth shattering here.<br /><br />Where that might not mean much for other artists - it does for her.influences.

B000P46QTA|5.0|This brilliant, quiet film concerning life under the iron boot of a truly totalitarian society, the GDR (East Germany) in the pre-Glasnost 80's, is a wonderful examination of life in that opressive regime and the effects on both those spied upon and those doing the spying.  Beautifully composed and filmed it has a central portrayal by Ulrich Muhe that is simply remarkable and stunning work.  Nuanced and subtle, Muhe's seemingly impassive face in actuality conveys worlds of meaning as we see the conflict grow in this Stasi bureaucrat as all of the assumptions and precepts of his life are called into question by his surveillance of people trying to live real lives with some value within the unyielding confines and contradictions of a Soviet-style socialist state.  It is a world class performance and, tragically, this fine actor's last.    All of the supporting work by Martina Gedeck as the sensuous and compromised actress, Sebatian Koch as the conflicted playwright, and Ulrich Tukur as Muhe's ambitious and more politically savvy Stasi boss, is fine as well.  But this show belongs to Muhe and his director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who has brought this page of history to life with fidelity and care.  He has written a fine work that reveals life under the unrelenting intrusion of the State, and he found his muse in Muhe, who actually lived under those conditions in the GDR and was himself a courageous opponent of the State before the wall fell.    The film moves at the deliberate and stately pace of the Sonata that is one of its centerpieces: quietly somber, sad and slightly dissonant.  This is first class work and a classic that fully deserved the Best Foreign Language Oscar it won.  First rate in all departments, this is a great film with a transcendent central performance that is a tribute to both the man and the actor. When presented with an approximation of the dread atmosphere generated by true opression, one is cautioned not to use such terms frivolously in our own discourse.  This is what life was like under the bootheel, there and then, in our time.  It should not be forgotten.

B0007TKNKG|5.0|In my opinion, the reason why this movie did not do well at the box office back in '87 was because it was advertised as an action movie only.  The fact is that this more resembles the original Rocky film in that it is a drama with pieces of action but not at all a complete action film.  Despite that, this is a very underrated film with some (okay maybe a lot of)\\"over the top\\" acting.  The point is that even with those flaws, it is still a great movie with a redeeming and good story line that delivers important values/lessons for us all.

The end is not in sight as the company even entered the genetics field. With its enormous storage capacity and its massive computing power for analyzing vast quantities of data, scientists should be able to search and find specific genes and genetic abnormalities that are causing diseases.

B000VAPZM2|5.0|I love this movie! I love the music in it because<br />I have a really good singing voice. I have the soundtrack and I listen and sing it every day so far. My favorite song from the movie is Bet On It. My other favorites in this order are I Don't Dance,Everyday,Gotta Go My Own Way,You Are The Music in Me,Work This Out, and What Time is It! I think everybody all ages will love this movie no matter how old they are.I think it is a great movie for kids in high school they can see how they can deal with people that get in there way and they can see how to deal with realtionsihps.I think it shows how to deal with problems in real life in any school but, really for like kids in middle school to high school that is what type of people are in the audience. I say it is for all ages babies, kids, tweens, teens, and adults. It is about Troy Bolton (Zac Effron) and Gaabreilla (Vansesa Hudgens) get split apart by Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) again and Ryan (Luvas Crabel) becomes more independent about himself. In the end everybody in the movie are friends at the end of it.  I really defitenly recommend  that you see the movie when it comes out on DVD. I think you will enjoy it very much. I know you will because I enjoyed it alot. I also bought the soundtrack the day it came out. I will also buy it on DVD the day it comes out on December 11, 2007. I defitenly recommend buying it on DVD on December 11, 2007.
B00012QLQ4|3.0|It is truly a shame that this film has two opposite facets, kind of like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The animation, graphics and attention to detail is among the best I have ever seen. However, the overall quality of this production is damaged by the lousy storyline, which is hard to follow and loses focus quickly. Being and anime fan, I realize that this is still a movie worth seeing, because the technical aspects are breathtaking, but those people that are not fans of genre, will likely be extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The story combines motorcycle gangs, mind experiments, corrupt politicians, secret organizations, an immense power that if it is not kept in check may cause havoc, and a couple of interesting characters. The main problem is that the logic and flow of the story quickly go astray, and we are left grasping at straws to keep our interest while we admire the perfect drawings and unbelievable action scenes. I feel conflicted now, because on one hand I want to try Otomo's next movie, [[ASIN:B0009P42S2 Steamboy]], hoping that the excellent animation is complemented by a good story, but what if it is not? I already realized that sometimes you cannot trust the hype.
B000UJBYD8|2.0|I have every studio Cult release.   I've been listening and loving them since the early days.   I accept that bands mature and change (heck, I'm also a Rush fan and they definitely have evolved over the years.)  I was excited this new Cult album was coming out and pre-ordered it without hearing anything on it, just knowing that it was the Cult was good enough.    Well, now after a few listens I can tell you I am dissappointed.  Yes, bands can change.  But the Cult have not just changed and matured, they have completely removed elements which defined the band (ie, the ability to HEAR the guitar clearly, and throwing in a few kick ass riffs onto every album).   None of the songs stand out.  The production is poor.  The guitar is muffled, and there is not a single TURN UP THE RADIO THIS KICKS riff on the disc(s).   The song writing seems very uninspired.  A very mediocre offering, no heart in it at all.  What happened to bleeding a little while you sing?   Guess they got some bandaids when they put this effort together....
0805079831|3.0|Klein does an adequate, but uneven, job in exposing the failures of the neoliberal,libertarian,anarchist,\\"free market\\", economic policies that were officially implemented by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund starting in 1981.She shows that these policies were advocated theoretically for many years prior to 1980 by the second Chicago school, founded by Milton Friedman ,Harberger,Stigler,Becker,etc.,in the late 1940's.She appears to be unaware that this second Chicago school was only created after the first Chicago school,consisting of Frank Knight,Henry Simons,Jacob Viner,and Paul Douglas, had been destroyed by Friedman based on his mistaken belief that they were \\" not scientific \\" because they refused to assume that all markets were normally distributed.The second Chicago school is based on the unsupported and falsified claim that all markets are either normally distributed or can be analyzed \\"as if \\" they were normally distributed.J M  Keynes, F H Knight,and J A Schumpeter demonstrated that there was little ,if any,support for this claim in the first half of the 20th century.Daniel Ellsberg,Benoit Mandelbrot,and Nassim N Taleb have demonstrated overwhelmingly in the second half of the 20th century ,as well as  early in the 21st century, that the normal distributions are purely artificial constructs that have no more existence than do the epicycles of Ptolemaic Astronomy.        A second problem with this book is the apparent belief by Klein that Milton Friedman is a follower of Adam Smith.Nothing could be further from the truth.Milton Friedman was a libertarian,an anarchist and an athiest.He, in no shape or form ,was a conservative in the sense of Adam Smith.Smith's analysis [see pp.296-340,especially pp.339-340 on money,interest, and banking,pp.434-439 on international trade and tariffs,pp.716-768 on the provision of education (and the importance of religious instruction)and other public goods,and pp.794-95 on taxation in the Modern Library(Cannan)edition]make it quite clear that Smith would be a vigorous opponent of the type and kind of deregulation,privatization,and monetary policy advocated by the second Chicago school.       A third problem  is that Klein appears not to be aware that the economic policy recommendations of Friedman,et al,are based on purely theoretical,artificially constructed ,non existent entities, like the equant points , eccentrics (or deferents),and cycloid paths of Ptolemaic astronomy.The policy recommendations were derived from purely abstract, academic, \\" black board \\",exercises or games used to test/promote/graduate undergraduate and graduate economics students who were economics majors taking courses in microeconomic theory at the University of Chicago and elsewhere.The totalitarian/authoritarian manner in which these theoretical policies were implemented by dictators in Chile,Indonesia,Central America,etc.,can not be blamed on or traced to Friedman.Friedman can ,of course, be heavily criticized for remaining relatively ,if not completely ,silent after it became clear that the manner in which his theoretical recommendations were being implemented as policy were directly and inherently contrary to his own views.        This book is worth reading because it presents a generally correct demolition of the neoliberal movements claims about deregulation,privitization,and monetary policy.The reader needs to  already know that these policies have absolutely nothing to do with Adam Smith or the kind of policies he supported in the Wealth of Nations.In a Smithian world those who can't afford to pay for their own education(and  religious instruction) are provided with it for FREE.A completely educated work force is a precondition for Smith's system of Natural Liberty.Given that such a condition is very far from being satisfied in most second and third world countries,neoliberal policies in such countries were doomed to fail from the very start.
B00005JP5P|1.0|We can only hope that Danny Boyle will come to his senses regarding Alex Garland. Not that Boyle, as evidenced here, is any great shakes as a director. Or maybe \\"shaking\\" is part of the problem, as he trots out camera trick after camera trick and an endless parade of beauty shots of the Icarus II, the film's big bad spaceship, to cover the huge gaps in Mr. Garland's script. Those who've been fooled as a result by the film's visuals (and, granted, very pretty music) will have a grand old time experiencing \\"Sunshine\\" with their wall-size HD TV screens and their eardrum-shattering speaker systems; those of us who enter the fray looking for plot, characterization, marginally human-sounding dialogue, logic, or even a bare peppering of common sense from the crew of dimwits essaying this all-too-important mission to save the world will come away disappointed. A sad waste of a talented cast (many of whom, I suspect, signed on before Garland coughed up the final version of the film's confusing, embarrassingly derivative, bare-bones screenplay) and a lovely soundtrack by John Murphy and Underworld. (Note: The following is based on a viewing of the UK DVD release:) If you do pick up the DVD, head straight to the deleted scenes, where Danny Boyle, here the master of the wrong choice, has cleverly hidden away a few scraps of characterization, most notably regarding Rose Byrne's character, Cassie, who in the deleted bits displays the spine she never gets to show in the film's final cut.

B000002I25|5.0|This debut album by The Doors instantly solidified their place in rock history; this album has some pretty awesome hits and just one listen proves it!<br /><br />The track set begins with their classic \\"Break On Through (To The Other Side).\\" The sound effects are great; the electric guitar by Robby Krieger is awesome and Jim Morrison sings his heart out for this number. Love that percussion by John Densmore, too! Most rock fans will enjoy this number if by some chance they haven't heard it already.<br /><br />\\"Soul Kitchen\\" starts with great guitar playing in several different keys and when Jim comes in this number takes off like a rocket! \\"Soul Kitchen\\" sports a good, solid beat to make it a excellent number. Jim sings of how he wants to sleep one night in his girlfriend's \\"soul kitchen;\\" cool! In addition, \\"The Crystal Ship\\" deals with Jim's wanting another kiss from his girl before she goes to sleep--or could this be referring to a drug trip instead of sleep? In any event, Jim delivers \\"The Crystal Ship\\" with remarkable sensitivity; I am very impressed by the beauty of this fine ballad.<br /><br />\\"Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)\\" makes good use of the guitars; and the horn is really great! Love that percussion, too! Jim sings this number flawlessly; and I predict that you will like \\"Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)\\" very much. Of course, \\"Light My Fire\\" remains a classic for The Doors; I love those guitars and when Jim implores his girlfriend to spend romantic time alone with him you know he truly means it! \\"Light My Fire\\" is definitely one of the best rock songs ever written. The song also has a musical interlude that is a perfect example of 1960s psychedelic/acid rock. Excellent!<br /><br />\\"I Looked At You\\" has terrific percussion as Jim sings this to perfection; and \\"End Of The Night\\" also seems to be a type of experimental rock number. \\"End Of The Night\\" is a song that begins in such a strong minor key it grabs your attention and holds it every step of the way.<br /><br />The CD ends with \\"The End.\\" \\"The End,\\" written with careful use of the guitars and percussion, sounds experimental and it is also very beautiful. Jim starts by singing of how his relationship with his woman is ending. Jim Morrison delivers this with panache and \\"The End\\" closes the album very fittingly.<br /><br />The liner notes include the song credits for the songs not written by The Doors; and the artwork is excellent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD for anyone who wants to hear classic rock at its finest; and this is also a good CD for people who want to get to appreciate the artistry of The Doors.<br /><br />Great job, everyone!\\" written with careful use of the guitars and percussion, sounds experimental and it is also very beautiful.

B000TX7B5U|5.0|I'm so relieved to be listening to \\"Elect the Dead\\" after almost losing all hope with SOAD's latest albums Hypnotize/Mesmerize. Upon reading the liner notes in the above stated LP's, it became obvious where the control in the band had ended up. Don't get me wrong I think Daron is a talented musician who works well in a back-up vocal role to Serj. but let's face it. Serj is SOAD and I think most others will agree that an element has been missing in System since Malakian has taken over the primary writing and lead vocal parts of SOAD. I personally tire fast of the silly, meaningless, unintelligent side of more recent SOAD. I don't know the true story on how it happened, but somehow either by choice or by force the voice of System of a Down was tracked to nothing more than a background voice.  Too me, the album \\"Steal this Album\\" showcased Daron's writing style, and for a B-sides album, it was truelly amazing! But let's call it like it is.  It (Steal this Album) was still a B-sides album.  Both Hypnotize and Mesmerize had thier highlights, sighting \\"Holy Mountains\\" as one of the more memorable gems on an album set hindered by piles of Fools Gold.  Okay, enough on the history of one of the greatest bands in existence.  Let us give credit where credit is due.  This album is nothing short of pure brilliance.  The structure, balance, emotion reminds me of everything that I love about Toxicity, and SOAD's self-titled release.  I'm entranced by this album.  After the second listen you'll be hooked and catching little intricate parts that you might've missed the first time through.  If you are someone into radio singles, this isn't going to be for you.  If you appreciate good music in the vein of Tool, RATM, Dredg. and Porcupine Tree.  Pick this album up!  This is the spirit of System of A Down and what it was meant to be.  There is something to be said about passion!
B00005JNS0|4.0|There aren't any new plots, and most stories have predictable endings. Pixar's success has been the result of paying more attention to the journey than the destination -- it's the unexpected ways the plots are worked out, and clever surprises along the way that make the telling of the story fresh (or at least seem fresh).<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" is the tale of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant, self-centered race car who has to learn that winning isn't everything, and that one's path through life is more important than the destination. We've seen all this before, but Lasseter & friends handle it with some degree of subtlety, with the story driven by character, not plot. (See my review of \\"Spirited Away\\", which is basically the same story, but developed very, very badly.) And there are some grin-inducing surprises, such as the cow-tipping sequence. The ending is also pleasing -- Lightning decides that winning the big race is not the most-important thing, and is amply rewarded in other ways.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" is a good film, but not quite up to the standards of most of the preceding Pixars. Why, I can't say. All the parts are present, but the pistons just don't seem to be firing at full power. Perhaps not enough time is spent with the secondary characters. I intend to watch \\"Cars\\" again, but mostly to catch all the little details, gags, and asides I missed the first time. Unlike the \\"Toy Story\\"s, \\"A Bug's Life\\", or \\"The Incredibles\\", it's not a film I'm likely to watch because I feel like some mood-lifting fun. It's all a bit too mechanical. (Your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />The extras are of the generally high quality one expects from Pixar. The \\"making of\\" is, if anything, too short -- one would like to know more about the people Lasseter met along Route 66. \\"Mater and the Ghostlight\\" is amusing but ultimately pointless (it was apparently a deleted sequence -- Mater suggests that he and Lightning stay up to look for the ghostlight, but they don't -- and was animated as a DVD bonus), while \\"One-Man Band\\" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)<br /><br />I'm surprised Disney's 1951 cartoon \\"Susie, the Little Blue Coupe\\", an obvious influence, isn't included. Regardless of how one might feel about the typically cute/sentimental story, it's a pleasure to watch a cartoon short subject made with as much attention to detail and quality as a feature film.<br /><br />PS: Disney HD showed \\"Cars\\" last night, and I watched because I had nothing better to do that I felt like doing. My feelings haven't changed. \\"Cars\\" lacks the surprises and twists of most other Pixar films, chugging its way to a predetermined finish. It just isn't much fun.n Band\\" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)

0007205236|4.0|Let's be honest.  Only a minute percentage of people can say that we have experienced abject poverty in Limerick, Ireland, so it is necessary for someone such as Frank McCourt to shine a light on his personal childhood.  McCourt leads us his childhood through his memoir, Angela's Ashes.  The reader is a witness of McCourt's childhood in many respects.  The majority of McCourt's memoir is told in the present tense, so it is more like a novel and McCourt is just a character in the story.  McCourt tells his story as if it is happening right then and he is writing down his thoughts at the time.  He is often part of the dialogue.  When Frank delivers a telegram to Mrs. Finucane, their conversation goes:     How old are you, by?      Fifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.      Young enough to make a fool of yourself     and ould enough to know better.  Are you shmart,     by?  Are you anyway intelligent?      I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane (331).      Since McCourt takes the reader inside the story, it is easier for the reader to relate to and sympathize with McCourt and try to understand the struggles he went through as a child.   However, the reader does not always sympathize with Frank McCourt because there are a few times throughout the book in which there is an extreme lack of ethos.  One of these times was on the first page of the book.  McCourt writes \\"[P]eople everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying school masters; the English and the horrible tings they did to us for eight hundred years\\" (11).  Although there is ethos throughout the rest of the book with the exception of a few slip-ups, it was impossible to forget that first part of the book where McCourt trivializes everyone else's problems and says that his problems are the worst and are the only ones that anyone can complain about.  As a reader, one might think, \\"[I]f he doesn't care about our problems, why should we care about his?\\"   McCourt puts forth a story that is miserable and even frightening at times, but should not have said that his story is more important than everyone else's.  In a way, it makes the reader feel detached from McCourt's story that is so well written in general.
B000W8OM5Y|4.0|This is a timeless movie which I love. I would rather have the Director's Cut than this Special Edition. Here's how it is. In a couple of years they'll probably released the Director's Cut (which I will definatly buy)and then, a couple more years later, they might release the Director's Cut with the extras of this Collector's Edition. If you want the new extras now, get it. But it might, just might be better to wait. I haven't decided weather I'm geting this or not.

That was 30 years ago. This collection of feather-brained moral superiority is one of the biggest rip-offs I've ever wasted my money on. I just don't have the words to express my disdain of most of the lyrics on this CD--and as for her revision of Rudyard Kipling's \\"If,\\" on the final track...well, Joni, I'm glad you're happy with it, but shame on you for inflicting it on the rest of us.    If you ever loved Joni, folks, spare yourself this one.

The story is great, imaginative and full of magic every step of the way. And the cast, OMG, cast is the best! De Niro alone is worth seeing the movie.. it was a magical magical experience, sitting in the movies, forgetting the world outside the screen and just enjoying being pulled into the story.. One of the sweetest films I've ever seen..

0792838068|4.0|If you watch this film, you will find yourself turning the volume way up during any dialog. When any music is played (or sound effects), you will RUSH to turn the volume down by about 40 to 70%. This film has, by far, the wrost sound-mix of any DVD I've watched. On top of that, the soundtrack is kind of annoying, and detracts from the film often. Nevertheless, its still a good film, despite the above.
B00005U8EM|5.0|1993. Produced, co-written with Danny Rubin, and directed by Harold Ramis. In my humble opinion, THE adult dramatic comedy of the nineties. A rare screenplay and an outstanding performance by Bill Murray. Funny but smart. Masterpiece.

B00005JPLW|5.0|In 480 BC, 300 Spartans refused to bow to the thousand nations of Persian Empire, under the command of Xerxes (Santoro). Led by the ferocious King Leonidas (Butler), the 300 'no retreat, no surrender' Spartans - all picked because they had at least one son to carry on their name - defied the mystics and fought The Battle Of Thermopylae. How director Zack Snyder made a movie so gory, so violent, yet so beautiful to look at is beyond me. This is the movie's selling point, as characterisation is minimal and the performers are reduced to shouting their lines, even though they may be whippet-smart laconic quips the Spartans were famous for. It does tend to get a bit Lord-Of-The-Ringsy (now a recognised term) with the various deformed characters, armoured elephants and angry rhinos - but that's neither here nor there. This is a movie event that finally delivers - a jaw-dropping, magnificent spectacle that will reinvent the old swords-and-sandals epic that suffered at the hands of the messy Troy, the boring Kingdom Of Heaven and the wholly underwhelming Alexander. 300 is a victory of style over substance - actually it's more than a victory.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|After the lukewarm Panic Room, it's back to business for Fincher with Zodiac. A grandiose, sprawling movie, Zodiac documents the efforts San Francisco police went through to bring down its most notorious killer. Moving from the viewpoint of the victims, to detectives Toschi (Ruffalo) and Armstrong (Edwards), to the Zodiac-obsessed Chronicle cartoonist Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) and alcoholic reporter Avery (Downey Jr.), Fincher and writer James Vanderbilt (who adapted Robert Graysmith's book) leave no stone unturned in the hunt for the killer. So meticulous is their approach, to call Zodiac a slow burner is a major understatement, as in-depth analyses of crime scenes follow careful examination of the killer's psyche. Kicking off in 1968 and finishing up in the late '80s while simultaneously encompassing a whole host of fleshed-out characters and dead end plotlines, Fincher again attempts something different in a genre - an epic serial killer movie - and Zodiac is the JFK of serial killer movies, an All The President's Men of detective movies. The principal cast deliver believable performances, never putting a foot wrong in their understated roles, but this is really Gyllenhaal's movie.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I grew up in one of the Eastern Block countries during the communist era. I have seen movies, and read books about what had happened.  Few of them managed to capture the atmosphere of oppression, the dehumanizing effect, and utter despair that embroiled the lives of most who experienced it. Yes, most.  I read a few of the reviews claiming that the movie exaggerates the ability and persistence of the Stasi, in order to make the story more James Bond-like. Unfortunately, it is a characteristic of people who have never suffered, to assume that life really is, at its core, an easygoing party.  Even movies that depict tragic events, are assumed to have taken more or less ordinary (read fun-filled) lives and fictionalized them to appear extraordinary.  Personally, I am grateful for such a movie.

B00005JKGK|5.0|Joy Luck Club is a story about women: mothers and daughters, wives and lovers, mother and daughter in-lawas.      The characters are rich and full of flaws as well as strengths.     More, the storyline is truly interesting and engrossing.  The relationship between each other and each friend rings true and ironic as only real life can be.    I loved when Waverly told her mother how unfair it was that she had so much power over her.    Mothers of teenagers and adults forget that no matter how old our children get, not only will they always remain our \\"babies\\"...we will always be their first love and their first shelter against the world.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Though the 1982 theatrical release was very influential to me, when I first saw it, I prefer the 1992 Director's Cut for two reasons:    1. The scene in the middle of the film, where Rachel asks Deckard about her incept date, and the question upsets him, makes no sense in relation to the tacked on happy ending of the 1982 version, but makes perfect  sense in light of how the Director's Cut ends.      2. With the voice over narration gone, you can hear all of the Vangelis music.      I just saw the new Final Cut at the Uptown in Washington, DC, and, though it's not much different from the Director's Cut, I think it's marginally the best version.  Among the subtle changes to the dialogue is one that fixes a continuity error existing in all the previous versions.  Regarding the six Replicants that escaped from Off-World, \\"One of them got fried running though an electrical field\\" is changed to \\"Two of them got fried running through an electrical field.\\"  There's also a small but meaningful change, of a single word, in the scene where Roy confronts Tyrell.

What a delight to read a book that intimately shares one woman's journey in such a detailed, charming way that we take a trip around the world.

B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|This movie is an action thriller that will leave you breathless.  From the opening scene, it is non-stop, filled with great chases and a fun cat and mouse sense of urgency.  Matt Damon continues to give Jason Bourne a realness in his humanity as he continues his quest to find himself and clear his name of any wrong doing.  Joan Allen gives another gritty performance as Pamela Landy, the Deputy Director of the CIA.  New to the trilogy is David Strathairn, who plays Noah Vosen, the head of Operation Blackbriar, a re-named Treadstone, the assassin program into which Jason Bourne was brainwashed and trained.<br /><br />As the third installment of the Bourne saga, it doesn't disappoint.  The only drawback is that much was shot with the shaky \\"hand-held camera\\" feel.  Many find this distracting and difficult to watch.  It is, however, no shakier than \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", and is thought by some to add to the intensity of the scenes, creating a feeling of the viewer intruding into Bourne's world and eavesdropping on his conversations. You be the judge, and enjoy the ride!  It's fast and furious, to be sure!

B00005NTJK|5.0|Slightly biased, i guess, because i found this, along with some other albums in the trash! i took them home, and listened. for years!!! this is such an album: one you could listen to over and over, like paintings or movies or books or letters of this type that absorb you - and allow you to discover NEW things every time you experience them again. that's what constitutes a classic in my mind: something that never loses value, only gains. the production, composition, musicianship and creativity overflows in this album like good wine that is poured into the glass and cannot be contained because there isn't enough room. LOL. or something like that. i'm not a poet, i'm an educated musician. this record is earned well all scratches that are etched into its worn out surface. simply amazing, particularly Sossity You're A Woman!
1416523359|3.0|All I can say is that I was very disappointed.  I struggle with this question the last couple of his books.  Is it because he is Stephen King and I know his past books are fantastic that I go into expecting a lot?  If it was a unknown author would I have liked it more?  Or does it just plan stink?  I have come to the realization that it is all.  I think gone are the days of The Stand and The Shining.  It is now a different Stephen King.  Now are the deadlines and just wanting to pump the next book out.  But, I still read them hoping for that one gem.

So brilliantly written (and translated, i suppose), and so wise. rich with stories and characters, places, thoughts, it captivates you, and ultimately inspires you! question is: can you take flight with its inspirations? all it takes is the initial commitment to follow your dreams, and live a truer life. i did! at least for the first few weeks. LOL. STILL, i never forgot its lessons, the ones it bestowed upon me so gently and powerfully! one day i shall take yet another step closer to my dreams. This book could change your life, too.
0446698326|2.0|In the beginning of the book, I had a hard time liking the character of Savannah. Just to goody goody for me.  Made her too perfect and that is  how she was throughout the book.  As being a military wife that use to live in the same town as Nicholas Sparks, he did describe Wilmington good.  The military aspect of the book was wrong. Mr.Sparks, you could have at least made him a Marine being the number of them that live around you. I also didnt appreciate the fact that he had to add his own opinion of the war into the book.  There really wasn't a reason to add that but to state his opinion.  The ending was completely predictable.  He should have also investigated horses which that is not how you pick up a horses hoof. The part of the book that I enjoyed, was the relationship with his father. I did also enjoy the mention of Stephen Kings books in the book.  Huge fan!  I wish Nicholas Sparks would branch out a little of his sappy love stories and into something a little more complex. He is a talented writer that I feel is just not meeting his mark. The last couple of books he has written, just too predictable for me.  I did enjoy a few of his later ones but this is probably the last one for me. The only reason I have read his books are that they remind me of when I use to live on the North Carolina coast.  He does a wonderful job describing the area and people.

B000683VI4|5.0|\\"I am no one special, just a common man with common thoughts. I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me, and my name will soon be forgotten; but in one respect, I've succeeded as gloriously as anyone who has ever lived. I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and for me, that has always been enough.\\" These words are part of the opening scene to my favorite movie of all time: The Notebook. The Notebook is a very captivating and emotional movie that is bound to steal any viewer's heart.   The Notebook has incredible casting including Rachel McAdams who plays the teenage Allison Hamilton, and Ryan Gosling as the teenage Noah Calhoun. Both of these very attractive, talented people put on an outstanding performance in this tragic romance of two young lovers torn apart by their differing social classes. When they reunite years later, their love rekindles and they are faced with hard decisions that, whichever path they choose, will leave someone with the love of their life, and someone with their heart broken. In the movie, the whole story is read by an old man reading to an old woman in a care facility; the man is Noah and the woman is Allison, or Allie. He reads her the story of their lives, hoping each day that her memory will come back to her if he reads it to her again. This movie is a tear-jerker, but not only because of the heartbreaking parts, but also because of the overwhelming happiness and joy that this movie portrays about these two young lovers.   There is no movie that can come close to The Notebook in so many ways: the casting, story line, directing, music, lighting, and scenery are all one of a kind and blend together so incredibly in this movie.   The Notebook is based on the best-selling novel The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. The movie does have its \\"flaws,\\" as some may say, compared to the novel; it does not follow along with Spark's version exactly, as most movies based on novels do not, but it is very similar. It is hard for me to say which is better, the movie or the novel, and that is something that I hope you can decide on your own after watching the movie and reading the book.   This movie is appropriate for everyone who can understand love, and even those who have not experienced love or have a cold heart will be completely melted by the innocence, true love, heartbreak, and happiness in this movie. Every time I watch this movie, even though I've seen it countless times, I still get teary-eyed, broken-hearted, and catch myself smiling every once in a while.

B000GBEWHA|5.0|I was pretty dismissive about the film back when it came out in 78, but i got the DVD on an impulse and i was very pleasantly surprised.  Olivia Newton John and John Travolta are simply terrific, look terrific, sing terrific and dance terrific.  Not highbrow by any means, but posesses excellent production values and it actually dates quite well.  My kids enjoy it, though it is marred by a few adult themes and passing vulgarity.
0316018953|2.0|I didn't fully comprehend this phrase until reading this book.  It's as if Mr. Connelly, usually an excellent writer, turned this over to some high school wannabe.  It's dull, the plot is tired, the characters are shallow and the writing is simply silly.  I can't imagine how Mr. Connelly can tolerate this book out there with his name on the cover.  In addition, the audio version is read by someone who must be an old friend of the family.  How else to account for the sing song voice, inability to add drama or tension to the story and inconsistent accents.  A high school drama major could have done a better job! What a disappointment for fans of this author.

B000MG1ZGA|5.0|Listening to the other Doors remixes, I felt like the surviving band members and engineer/producer Bruce Botnick were trying to retrofit the older, more psychedelic albums to sound like the blues-rock punch of \\"L.A. Woman.\\"  It didn't work so well for something like \\"Waiting For The Sun,\\" but it does provide a welcome sonic update for \\"L.A. Woman\\" itself.<br /><br />The original album sounded just a touch piecemeal as a few of the tracks were from older sessions in the case of \\"L'America\\" or in the Doors' older style as in \\"Love Her Madly.\\"  I always felt that this stood in contrast with the live-in-the-studio tracks recorded for the album itself.  The wide-open, percussion heavy mixes here make the whole thing sound more of a complete sonic picture.  \\"The Changeling\\" and the title track have a little more bite, which I dig.  In fact, the only track here I prefer from the original are \\"Riders On The Storm,\\" which is a little less dreamy and delicate sounding here, and \\"Love Her Madly.\\"  As I said, the new mix fits on the album better, but I'd consider the original a damn fine single mix.<br /><br />If you want to get a positive taste of the new mixes of the Doors albums, I'd head for this one first as it does offer what may actually be an improvement over the original.
0800141660|4.0|Jane Austen is regarded as England's first woman novelist. She concentrated on the manners and morals of the English upper classes, in particular on relationships between men and women. Her novels centered on romance and marriage.  This story tells of a man who had two marriages, of the division of his fortune and of the difficulties encountered by his daughters who are  left with little money by the rules of inheritance.  The women are taken in by a kindly relative. Each daughter falls in love, but the twists and turns of the relationships make for comedy and tragedy.  The movie is beautifully shot, the color is rich and the scenery is stunning.
B000MCIBAW|4.0|This 40th anniversary mix shares a few of the flaws of the other Doors albums of this period, Jim's vocals have been pushed back a little more than needed and Densmore's (quite well-played) drums are a touch too loud.  Fortunately, the new mix retains the psychedelic atmosphere of the original while provided some nice added clarity and decompression.  Some of the effects like Jim's echoing vocals on the title track actually sound a little better here.  The strange vibe of \\"Horse Latitudes\\" comes across quite well here.  Some of the added instrumental and vocal parts (from the original sessions, mind you) are also more welcome here.  I'm still keeping the 1999 remaster of this one on my ipod, but I'd be much quicker to recommend this remix than those of the proceeding or following albums.
B000VH3FV8|3.0|\\"Love, Luther\\" covers most of the bases of defining Luther Vandross' career, but there are some obvious omissions his long-time fans would notice. There are an incredible seven of Luther's 26 top 10 singles missing -- \\"I'll Let You Slide,\\" \\"She Won't Talk to Me,\\" \\"I Really Didn't Mean It,\\" \\"The Rush,\\" \\"Sometimes It's Only Love,\\" \\"Little Miracles (Happen Every Day)\\" and \\"Treat You Right.\\" There is no excuse for a box set to leave off one hit song, much less one-fourth of an artist's top 10 catalog (particularly \\"Treat You Right,\\" which was available only on the now-deleted \\"The Best of Luther Vandross: The Best of Love\\" release in 1989).    Quite frankly, I would have made this a five-disc set and used the full album versions of his most memorable songs (including the remastered versions from the \\"The Best of Love\\" set) for the first four discs and the final one for the \\"bonus\\" material. In light of the release of \\"The Ultimate Luther Vandross\\" in 2006, I would have left off songs like \\"Shine\\" and \\"Got You Home\\" and added songs like \\"Make Me a Believer,\\" \\"You're the Sweetest One\\" and \\"My Sensitivity (Gets in the Way).\\"

B00005K3NR|5.0|Right on the heels of \\"Obsession\\" (1975), DePalma directed the film adaptation of Stephen King's first novel, \\"Carrie\\" (1976), the story of the girl with telekinetic powers who is the underdog in her high school, and has a very horrific date to the prom that goes horribly awry. Produced by Paul Monash and scripted by Lawrence D. Cohen.<br />Well, to begin with, it's neat, knowing how DePalma works, loving to tell stories in complicated ways, using flashbacks, weaving back and forth, and nonlinear fashion, that he would choose to use a very straight forward approach with this film, when the source novel itself was written in a back and forth, nonlinear fashion, with lots of flashbacks.<br />The film opens with an awesome crane tracking shot showing high school girls outside playing volleyball, and the camera slowly moving in on one particular girl as you hear voices in the background saying \\"Hit it to Carrie, she'll miss it, hit it to Carrie\\", and they do, and she misses the ball. Then as they are all passing by her to shower, they tease and taunt her some more, calling her vile names.<br />Cut to the shower room, now the film is moving in glorious slow motion, in a very erotic way during what could be concidered a very erotic scene: A girl, naked, showering, feeling her naked body with her hands as she soaps herself down, making her way down between her legs, where her hands linger for a while. Then we see blood slowly pouring down her legs from her vagina...Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in an Oscar nominated role) is having her first menstrual cycle at the age of 17. Well, every girl in the gym shower room starts hollering \\"Plug it up! Plug it up!\\" as they start throwing tampons at her. The scene has now turned viciously ugly in the blink of an eye. Miss White (Betty Buckley), the gym teacher immediately tends to Carrie, even having to slap her trying to calm her down, and a light bulb busts.?.?.<br />In the principal's office, Miss White is explaining to the principle how nasty the girls were because Carrie was having her 1st period at such an age, and did not know what was happening to her, matter of fact she thought that she was bleeding to death. The principle, Mr. Morton (Stefan Gierasch) calls Carrie into the office to excuse her from school for the afternoon, and as he speaks to her, he keeps calling her Cassie, and as we see Carrie getting upset, a huge marble ashtray begins to warble on the principle's desk, then go flipping through the air when she declares her name is Carrie.!.<br />As she is walking home, a young kid on his bicycle (Cameron DePalma, Brian's nephew) goes out of his way to ride by her calling out \\"Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!\\" just as his bike flips into the air, throwing him off of it.?.?.<br />Carrie is utterly mystified by these occurances.<br />She arrives home where she lives with her crazy, deranged, religious fanatic mother, Margeret White (Piper laurie, who DePalma got to come out of retirement for this role, and she was nominated for an Oscar, too, for her performance in this). Margeret blames Carrie for the incident at school (for having her menstrual cycle), and locks her in a closet to pray for forgiveness for her sins. As the film progresses, we learn that the closet and Carrie are no strangers to one another, and that Margeret White is utterly insane. And, for reasons well understood, Carrie doesn't want to be like her mother, she wants to be normal and have people like her, something each and everyone of us can relate to; a very Human condition.<br />Back at school, Miss Collins punnishes the girls in Carrie's gym class by putting them in detention, HER detention, and punnishment for not showing up is 3 days suspension from school and refusal of sales of prom tickets, hitting them where it really hurts. The key members in this little scenario are Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen, who would go on to star in 3 other DePalma films, \\"Home Movies\\", \\"Dressed To Kill\\", and \\"Blow Out\\", and then onto a few B-rate films, like the \\"Robocop\\" films, and \\"Strange Invaders\\"), a snobby b**ch who lives to make Carrie's life miserable, her two friends, Norma Watson (P.J. Soles, \\"Halloween\\", \\"Rock -N- Roll High School\\") and Helen (Edie McClurg, \\"Planes, Trains, & Automobiles), who all end up in Chris' scheme to sabotage the prom after Chris gets kicked out of detention and refused her prom tickets. And, there's sympathetic Sue Snell (Amy Irving (DePalma's \\"The Fury\\", \\"Traffic\\"), who feels sorry for Carrie, so she ends up asking her jock boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt, \\"House\\", tv's \\"Greatest American Hero\\") to take Carrie to the prom. Meanwhile, Chris is convincing her thuggish, sick/twisted/psychotic high school drop out boy friend Billy Nolan (John Travolta in his first film) to help get even with Carrie White (she blames Carrie for not being able to attend the prom). It involves pig blood and rigging the prom's King and Queen votes so that Tommy Ross and Carrie White will win.<br />The prom sequence has gone down in movie history as one of the greatest scenes ever in horror film and/or drama (and/or satire), for this film is all three genres.<br />In the meantime, Carrie starts noticing her 'power', like breaking a mirror in her bedroom just by thinking about it in anger, then placing it back together without even touching it, well, like she did with the lightbulb and the boy on the bicycle earlier in the film. We also get to learn a lot more about her demented home life with her scary deranged mother, who when learns of Carrie going to the prom starts hissing \\"They're all gonna laugh at you! They're all gonna laugh at you!\\" in almost a prophetic way. Carrie, again, has to use her 'power', which she now knows is telekinesis because she has done a lot of reading up on the subject, mentally holding her mother down as she leaves for her date to the prom...Her date with destiny.?.?.?.<br />DePalma's pacing during this long drawn out set piece is awesome! The way he puts Tommy and Carrie in a spinning cycle dancing to symbolize the exuberation of how Carrie is feeling will leave you breathless. They are voted King and Queen of the prom. Meanwhile, Sue Snell has snuck to the prom to see how things are going, and she is the only person to see the rope leading up to the bucket right over the stage where the King and Queen of the prom will stand, done in a great crane tracking shot in slow motion (with an awesome score by Pino Donnaggio throughout the entire film, especially here), but she gets thrown out of the auditorium by Miss Collins before she can warn anyone about what she has seen. Meanwhile, Billy and Chris are below a set of steps that lead to the stage, arguing and carrying on like nothing is out of the ordinary.<br />As soon as the doors close on Sue Snell, the bucket of blood falls, and then the rest is movie history! Let's just say that all H*ll breaks loose, and only Carrie leaves alive from a burning auditorium of screaming students, something that is VERY haunting...The screams as she is walking out, and the doors close by themselves behind her. DePalma's use of split screen during Carrie's revenge sequence is utterly amazing!<br />After going home, bathing off the blood, and thinking she is being consoled by her mother, her mother (literally) stabs her in the back.<br />The 'crucifixion' of Margeret White is something that has to be seen to be believed! An awesome spetacle to rival anything ever done in horror!!<br />And, she ends up modeled just like the plaster Jesus in the 'praying closet' that Carrie grabs her dead mother and hides in as the house burns down, killing them both.<br />Cut to Sue Snell, where we see her in bed, sleeping, tossing and turning a bit, then her mom (Priscilla Pointer, Amy Irving's real-life mom) on the phone talking about how the doctors said Sue would be alright in due time.<br />Then, cut to the most famous scene in the film next to the prom sequence: Sue Snell is walking up to whereCarrie's house used to be with flowers in her hands, and she leans down to place the flowers beside a for sale sign with 'Carrie White Burns In H*ll' spray painted over it in red, and a hand comes out of the ground and grabs Sue by the arm and starts tugging.<br />The best part of the film, in my opinion, is the next scene, which is the end of the film, in which Sue wakes up all frantic and screaming, with her mom consoling her, and Sue is continuosly screaming as the camera, in another great crane tracking shot, starts bacing away, up toward the ceiling as mother tries to console daughter, saying \\"It'll be alright, Sue, it will be alright, Sue!\\" (the backward crane shot mirroring the opening crane shot, and the message that it will be a LONG time before Sue Snell forgets this whole nightmare).<br />One of the (if not the) best psychological, telekinetic, sinister, horrorfying, satiric tragedies ever filmed.<br />HIGHLY recommended! Happy Halloween!! ;-)cing to symbolize the exuberation of how Carrie is feeling will leave you breathless. They are voted King and Queen of the prom.

It goes way beyond what season 1 did. I loved this season, and I love this series. I can't wait till season 3 comes out next year!

B000M53GM2|4.0|Bond movies are known for breath-taking locations, great stunts and beautiful people.  Golden Eye definitely did not disappoint.  Pierce Brosnan played the role well, and he looked good.  The main attraction, though, was that beautiful, sexy female villain clad in black leather.  That was one smart, sexy villain who killed as easily as she made love.  I would die with a smile on my like that admiral guy too.  This my favorite Bond so far.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|We have loved every minute of this series that we have been able to watch.  My kids ask for it constantly and they all have their favorite parts.  However, one of the discs (#3) was unplayable.  No scratches or anything, but it just couldn't be read by our PS3, all the rest were fine.  I borrowed a friends disc and his worked fine.    Since we didn't get around to that disk until after 30 days we are just plain screwed apparently.    Make sure you check each disc as soon as you get it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I am not going to go into details as there are so many reviews for this film (mini-series).    I love westerns; from John Wayne to Gary Cooper to Randolph Scott to Steve McQueen to Burt Lancaster to Kevin Costner, but I just have to say that Lonesome Dove is my all time favorite western of them all.    There is no greater story, no better production, no more captivating sequences than in this one.  It is the best, absolutely the best of the best.  Robert Duvall is spectacular as Gus.  Duvall is the real deal.  He is great in Broken Trail and Open Range, I mean really great, but Lonesome Dove is the pearl of his career.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Tasting better than cherry pie and a cup of coffee, the groundbreaking \\"Twin Peaks\\" finally unites the original pilot movie plus the first and second season in one exceptionally remastered set. Created from new high definintion transfers, \\"Twin Peaks\\" looks marvelous. This is the ultimate edition for the entire run of the original series and includes the European theatrical cut of the pilot which included an ending shot specifically for that market. This edition could only be surpassed by a Blu-ray edition of the series which, hopefully, CBS is in the process of putting together.<br /><br />The bad news is that the commentary tracks that were on the original first season set (now out of print) that didn't include the pilot are not included as part of this set due to licensing issues associated with them. We do get, however, a terrific set of extras that makes up for the missing commentary tracks. We get the following special features:<br /><br />1) \\"The Log Lady Introductions\\"-Originally shot for the show when it was aired on The Mystery Channel<br />2) Recently discovered deleted scenes<br />3) \\"Secrets from Another Place\\"-A feature length documentary on the making of the series from origin to its cult status.<br />4) \\"Return to Twin Peaks\\"-We follow a group of devoted \\"Twin Peaks\\" fans as they explore the shooting locations of the original series.<br />5) \\"Saturday Night Live\\" excerpts-Kyle's monologue from his stint hosting SNL plus the \\"Twin Peaks\\" parody from the episode.<br />6) \\"Falling\\" music video as well as bumpers, on-air promos for the series and an interactive map for the locations of the show.<br />7) A packet of postcards and other assorted odds and ends related to the TV series are included.<br /><br />The Look of the show--A beautifully remastered picture for all the episodes and the series is presented pillar boxed in its original aspect ratio. Colors are rich with skin tones a bit \\"hot\\" but that was part of the look of the original show.<br /><br />The Big Picture: This is an exceptional set marred only by the lack of inclusion of the commentary tracks from the \\"Twin Peaks: The First Season\\" Artisan boxed set which came out a decade ago.

B000OVLBEO|3.0|Given the terrible reviews I had read, I expected this to be one of the worst movies ever produced.  Luckily, this was not the case.  Now, I will be the first to acknowledge the problems, Nicholas cage was too old for the role, eva mendes drained the life out of every scene, and some things made absolutely no sense (what was with the old ghost rider riding with him for the journey, then just stopping before the fight?  This was what he waited for all these years?)  But there was a few fun points.  The effects were great, I enjoyed the bad guys, and I wish there was more actual Ghost Rider.  An interesting begining, that could lead to a better sequel, should it ever occur.  Worth a look when nothing else is available.

Among the problems are: a dark film transfer, deleted scenes so grainy they look as if they were transferred from a bootleg VHS, and finally, a director's commentary that feels too simplistic for such a complex and stlyized retelling (meat and potatoes stuff - \\"I read Dracula as a kid, My brother did the title effects, ect.\\")    One a ray of sunlight is the documentary about Eiko Ishioka, the designer who gave the film its fantastic imagery.

However, the sound quality makes up for the 4:3 video. The remix is top-notch.    Songs are from all parts of the Pink Floyd era - something to please everyone. If you are a Dark Side of the Moon fan, this DVD pulls out all the stops on disk two. Make sure your sub-woofer is cranked up for the heartbeat - kick back and enjoy!
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I decided for halloween I'd watch a horror movie every night and, although have not done so religiously, have watched about 27 or so. This has allowed me to go back through the best of the last 40 years or so of horror and this was another gem I had failed to see when younger.<br /><br />This totally puts the awful remake to shame, now I can see why people bagged the new one so much (and I must admit I hated it it and fell asleep whilst it was on). This is one of the best horror's I've seen. Creepy, atmospheric, I loved it. Now I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of John Carpenter's films (maybe I'll have a week long mini-film festival!)<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00005JPFH|4.0|In the final chapter of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, we find Peter Parker finally reaching a fulfilling equilibrium between his normal life and his crime-fighting one, as he readies a proposal to childhood sweetheart Mary Jane. But such serenity is not meant to last, and our masked hero is attacked by foes both old and new. Parker's best friend Harry has again risen to avenge his father, a man made of sand terrorizes New York, and a gooey symbiotic life-form threatens to destroy Spider-Man entirely. With plenty of fantastical action, a heart-wrenching storyline complete with love and revenge, the funniest Bruce Campbell cameo ever, and a special effects-laden final showdown the magnitude of which hasn't been witnessed before, Spider-Man 3 may be the best installment yet.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 is undeniably an entertaining film. But Sam Raimi, perhaps pressured by the huge fan base or studio executives, has tried to cram too much into the third chapter of this hugely popular franchise. One of Spider-Man's best designed and admired comic book villains, Venom, makes his big screen debut, but it feels awfully small. Focusing mainly on New Goblin and the Sandman, Venom is left to relish in only the last half of the film. His design is greatly lacking from the enormously muscular and grotesque look of the comics. His large teeth-laden mouth and flicking snake-like tongue are drastically toned down and instead he is equipped with a high-pitched shriek. While Topher Grace's acting is adequate, his scrawny stature just doesn't seem to fit with how Venom has been drawn for so many years. The character development for this character is greatly stunted, and by the time Eddie Brock becomes Venom we don't really hate him and his motives against Spidey seem somewhat trivial.<br /><br />On the bright side, Sandman is an astonishing villain to behold and his human side is developed with much more care. Thomas Haden Church portrays Flint Marko with a tender demeanor and an honesty that makes you believe he's merely a victim of circumstance. The premise that leads to Marko becoming a powerful manipulator of sand is a bit hokey, but relatively accurate to his comic book origins. Spider-Man even comments: \\"where do these guys come from?\\" The special effects are flat out jaw-dropping. The realistic particle effects and transformations of dirt and mud forming into Church's statuesque face are unbelievably impressive and toward the conclusion when Sandman becomes a giant monstrosity of earth and cement, his roar of utter awesomeness echoes his appearance.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 does contain the most involved and complex love story of the three, and is a perfect culmination of all the loose ends and various plotlines started in the first two films. The story arc of Harry Osborn and his demented alter ego finally concludes and Spider-Man must try once and for all to mend their fragile friendship. Mary Jane and Peter plan to marry but jealousy and misunderstandings constantly impede their struggling love, and the appearance of Gwen Stacy (the gorgeous blonde Bryce Dallas Howard) further complicates their already murky love affair.<br /><br />Raimi divides the suspense in a few key spots with some truly inspired and outrageous dance numbers. Tobey throws around a few riotously funny moves after Venom's poison takes effect, giving him a cocky self-confidence and the desire to appear a bit \\"emo\\". These bits of humor perfectly supplement the tone and help ease the breakneck pacing of the film's action. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell's signature cameo, which easily outdoes the other two in comedic value.<br /><br />With near perfect special effects, interesting new characters, and an intensely complex storyline that converges and concludes every plot point and loose end from its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 is both a fitting finale and colossal blockbuster no Spidey fan should dare miss. Again shattering the myth that sequels can't be better than the original, this final chapter in the Spider-Man trilogy sends off our web-slinging superhero with an adventure befitting the expectations the legion of loyal fans hold for the series.<br /><br />-The Massie Twinshe Spider-Man trilogy sends off our web-slinging superhero with an adventure befitting the expectations the legion of loyal fans hold for the series.    -The Massie Twins

0765350386|5.0|Genius. I was unsure whether Brandon could top Elantris after I picked up Mistborn, because Elantris turned out to be one of the best fantasy novels I'd read in years. Page by page, he succeeded - by the end you'll be shaking your head in disbelief at what he pulled off. The pacing in this novel is perfect, a talent sorely lacking in most genre authors; I get the sense that Brandon would make an amazing spy novelist. The magic system and other world details are constructed with a diamond-edge precision. Overall a stunning effort.
B000GLKNIC|5.0|This exceptionally melodious album opens with the catchy up-tempo Thunder On The Mountain, a track with a lilting beat which is followed by Spirit On The Water, a tender love song, also tuneful and engaging with graceful touches of harmonica. Rollin' And Tumblin' with its snatches of jangling guitar is a succulent slice of folk rock.<br /><br />One of the highlights on this impressive work with its outstanding songs is the melancholy When The Deal Goes Down, a philosophical musing on the journey of life, on mortality and loyalty, with a beautiful tune and moving poetic lyrics, like the track Where Teardrops Fall on [[ASIN:B00026WU3M Oh Mercy]].<br /><br />The tempo picks up again for the rhythmic pop number Someday Baby, before the mood turns serious for Workingman's Blues, a flowing ballad, and then somber turns to sad on the poignant Beyond The Horizon with its redemptive imagery.<br /><br />There is another stirring love song in the form of Nettie Moore, a slow soulful number with clever lyrical twists and a spiritual undertone, whilst The Levee's Gonna Break is another rhythmic up-tempo track with a gripping melody whilst the bluesy Aint' Talkin' is a long atmospheric excursion.<br /><br />The powerful songs on Modern Times are delivered with guitars, bass, cello, piano, percussion, drums, violin, viola and mandolin for a rich, full sound and Dylan's voice sounds great. I highly recommend this brilliant album which is on a par with his best work of recent years such as [[ASIN:B000002C2E Time Out of Mind]].

B00005R24G|5.0|One of the most imaginatively scripted films ever made, Sleuth pits the wickedly clever Laurence Olivier against the seemingly vengeful Michael Caine in a game of murder, mystery, intrigue, deception and good old-fashioned sleuthing. Outstanding acting from its two main players, each earning an Academy Award nomination for their efforts, the film is careful to build an intricate story that unfolds in a uniquely unpredictable manner.<br /><br />Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) is invited to Andrew Wyke's (Laurence Olivier) secluded mansion to discuss Milo's desire to marry Andrew's wife Marguerite. Andrew is a detective fiction novelist who prides himself on solving dastardly crimes with his main character Sinjon Lord Merrydew, while Tindle owns a local salon. Well aware of his wife's frivolous activities and her infatuation with riches and exquisite possessions, Andrew offers Milo an opportunity to burglarize some expensive jewels (170,000 pounds worth) so that Milo can live happily with Marguerite, and Andrew can collect the insurance money and live happily with his mistress Teia. But not everything is as it seems, especially when the game-obsessed Andrew convinces Milo to use a clown costume and dynamite to stage the robbery; and add to that a tumultuous recreation of a downstairs fight with a fireplace poker and a pistol. A riveting contest of deadly one-upmanship ensues with unforgettable twists and an unparalleled conclusion.<br /><br />Expertly directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and based on the play by Anthony Schaffer, the film opens with delightfully circus-tinged music that lends itself throughout the entire film to mix up the tone as each of the characters transition from serious to comical. Tindle starts with a serious demeanor and is instantly weary of Andrew's proposition, but with his whimsical and carefree manner, Milo soon dons a surprising mask of laughable lightheartedness, joining in with dancing about and playful mockery. The interactions between the two constantly change from the serious tone of adultery to the nonchalant air of jocose buddies.<br /><br />The film is essentially only two people in a single location, and yet it never slows and never misses a beat, staying relentlessly engrossing. The mansion is filled with toys, odd d&eacute;cor and games - games being the focal point of the film. The design of the rooms is fantastic, with creepy dolls, mystifying puzzles, and electronic puppets, including Jolly Jack Tar the sailor, a particularly eerie life-size monstrosity that laughs and claps his hands at the touch of a button. These complex games emphasize the seriousness of the game played by Andrew, one easily crossing the line of a harmless practical joke. But even when the initial game concludes, another is started and the film is careful to never let you know when a game is over and who is about to win. Initially, more than winning and losing, it is the excitement of playing the game that thrills Andrew, and the audience is spellbound watching it unfold.<br /><br />With flawless performances by both Caine and Olivier and unbelievably intelligently scripted Shakespearean dialogue, Sleuth redefines audience immersion into a film in which the plot keeps thickening. Perhaps the most astoundingly coincidental moment of the film is early on when Olivier mentions that in years to come their roles might be reversed, and Milo will be the one fending off admirers of his trophy wife. 2007 marks the release of the remake of this 1972 classic, and Michael Caine ironically returns to play the role Olivier unquestionably perfected.<br /><br />- Mike Massie, [...]ange from the serious tone of adultery to the nonchalant air of jocose buddies.

0140157352|5.0|Fisher & Ury's book, Getting to Yes focuses on integrative bargaining and mutual gains bargaining--a positive correlation between goal attainment of the parties, wherein many people achieve their goals and objectives.      I read this book while in a graduate course in Bargaining and Negotiation, in the pursuit that I will work as an administrator in college student services.  As college student personnel, we will be in negotiations, whether or not we think we will be.  Often, encountering power and exhibiting it.  In Getting to Yes, power is addressed and helps those in positions of leadership by leading from a point of collaboration.  First, it offers tips on how to increase personal power--by first, setting out optimistically as you mentally prepare to negotiate.  Second, by developing a good working relationship with those with whom you are bargaining gives power to both parties.  Establishing good communication, listening to the other side, and showing that you have heard are all ways to increase mutual gains bargaining in Getting to Yes.   Also important, having a better alternative and being positive about it as a solution can impact interests in bargaining and negotiation.  As you move forward in an attempt to come to agreement, listening to and understanding others' interests bears relevant in achieving your best gain through bargaining and negotiation.  It is common sense that clear, direct, thoughtful communication is the key to success (and personal empowerment, more than power) with integrative/mutual gains bargaining.      Just in speaking practically, in how this book will benefit us in our future career pursuits, we'll often be salaried positions, rarely in collective bargaining units, so our right to negotiate salary and benefits will be within our grasp.  Getting to Yes focuses on empowering individuals to ask for what they are entitled to, and to bravely face negotiation situations, knowing that they can reach arbitrary decisions fairly and amicably while achieving maximum results and agreement for both parties.  If the focus remains optimistically on creating the best alternative with the goal to seek closure in the negotiation, then both sides may get to the heart of each other's motivations to reach a settlement without force or wielding power plays.  And as student affairs professionals, charged with budgetary restraints, of course, being aware of your limits and bottom line will help keep you measured in the negotiation process too.      In Getting to Yes, they talk about collaborative bargaining, but yet, there are those (often women) who cower to power and accept soft negotiated terms, for the sake of maintaining amicable relations but then may leave negotiations feeling embittered and powerless, Fisher & Ury set up their method in an accessible, replicable format that helps people get to yes feeling principled in their endeavor.    As it is inevitable that we will be in positions of leadership or management seeking negotiation, conflicts may emerge and we will want to present positive leadership attributes even as we are weathering conflict.

0805079831|4.0|[[ASIN:1412056918 Power and Powerlessness]]<br /><br />(This excerpt is taken from a fuller review on \\"Susan's Blog\\")<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine is essential reading for a new generation of activists. Few books help us to understand the world. Even fewer do this in an accessible form.<br /><br />Klein explodes the lie that free people choose free markets. Given a choice, most people choose government regulations on business and government-funded social services like universal health care. Because democracy is the enemy of the free market, free-market fundamentalists must use the most brutal and shocking force to get their way.<br /><br />The weakness of the book is that Klein confuses the chicken of power with the egg of profit. She states, \\"I believe that the goal of the Iraq war was to bomb into being a new free trade zone.\\" This is mistaken.<br /><br />Washington invaded Iraq to obtain a military base in a strategically important region of the Middle East. From this position, America can secure its global dominance by controlling a large portion of the world oil supply. Of course, enormous profits are being made in the process. But power comes first. American companies could never claim Iraqi oil without the U.S. military.<br /><br />Confusion concerning the relation between power and profit leads Klein to view the rise of disaster capitalism as something new, when it is the logical outcome of a system that has always sought profit at any price. What's new is the astonishing efficiency with which human lives and the environment are being destroyed.<br /><br />Klein advocates a Keynesian economy, where a \\"free market in consumer products\\" coexists with generous social services. However, such economies are an historical oddity that develop as a temporary response to social crisis.<br /><br />Examples include the American New Deal in response to the Great Depression and the post-war European welfare states. Once the threat of revolution is removed, the drive for profit resumes. The New Deal has been dismantled, and European states are privatizing their economies. Vulture capitalists are devouring Britain's welfare state, and Canada continues to privatize social services, despite annual government budget surpluses.<br /><br />Problems aside, The Shock Doctrine is a must-read. Klein reveals the deepening conflict between what most people want and where capitalism is taking us. She tells us that the world is descending into barbarism, not because of human nature, not because people don't care, not because we lost any argument, but because we have not yet organized in sufficient numbers to prevent it.<br /><br />The good news is that human beings not only suffer, we also rebel, and we can learn to rebel more effectively. Klein reveals three forces that can defeat capitalism: the organized working class, the politics of marxism and the principles of solidarity. Her conclusion is absolutely right. It's time to organize.profit resumes. The New Deal has been dismantled, and European states are privatizing their economies.

B000XA5K48|5.0|If you're looking for Oscar-worthy performances, breath-taking sets and locations and a truly great plot/storyline you won't find it here.  What you will find is a truly GREAT action movie that entertains you literally from the opening scene.  It's essentially 90 minutes of gun battles, fist fights and car chases.  You remove your brain, open your bag of popcorn and enjoy a GREAT action movie.  The producer and director obviously knew they wouldn't be in contention for an academy award with this one, and didn't care.  They were out to make a movie that was just plain FUN...and they succeeded.  I wish more studios would put movies like this out.  If you want to walk away from the movie with a big ole smile on your face, watch this movie.....again and again.  I saw it twice in the theaters in the first week and was really bummed when it wasn't being shown anymore.  Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I LOVED this movie because it didn't take itself seriously, it was just alot of fun.  Isn't that what going to the movies is all about?

And the ending will blow you away.   I always love a movie much more when I cannot figure out the ending, or the direction that it might be going in.   This movie will make you question your own reality.    See it!

The cupcakes are great, but the really amazing part to me is how delicious and simple the icing recipes are.  The vegan buttercream is delicious.  I also made the old fashioned velvet icing for my red velvet cupcakes.  That could be one of my all time favorite icings from this point forward.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  It has a creamy, custardy texture.  It's just yum!  Two enthusiastic thumbs up for this book.  Oh, and I too love the photos.

B00006LLNV|5.0|In this CD, one can find an excellent combination of melodies and performances for every mood. You can listen to it when you are angry, and feel that the music is angry with you; or listen to it when you are sad and hear the crying in the notes and the voices of the performers; or play it when you are feeling happy and the music will enhance your high spirits, as if you were walking a road in Mexico's countryside, under a warm sunny day. It's one of those CD's that can accompany your moods, no matter, because it reaches deep inside. Highly recommended!

B000UJ24SC|1.0|Ok first off for anyone who has accused of TBDM of being a metalcore band can go re learn their metal sub genre's again because to have metalcore you need to follow the Killswitch Engage formula.  As they invented the sound.     ALSO!!!!  METALCORE IS NOT A RIP OFF THE GOTHENBURG SOUND, THOUGH IT BORROWS ROOTS FROM THAT STYLE TO CREATE THE ELEMENT OF METAL + HARDCORE = METALCORE.     NOW to the review.     What happened to this album? The music they played for their 2003 release The Unhallowed, and their 2005 release Miasma is really nothing like what they have going on for this album.  Well as far as I can tell because i never even heard the whole album. If one can't handle the previews their is a problem if they own previous albums of the band.     See the previous albums have a quality that defines The Black Dahlia Murder, and thats the fast machine gun chugging guitars with the hammer smashing double bass drums/blast beats slaughtering everything and brutal guttural toned vocals mixed with a more mid high range of screaming vocals.  What i've noticed about this album is that yeah its all high screaming and barley any low guttural toned brutality unlike the other albums.  Even the guitar riffs sounded sub par but the drums were great!  I dunno i think its just me but i think they could do better, but i have the albums that produce the sound i like from this great MELODIC DEATH METAL BAND!!!!!     ALSO THE LYRICS ARE WHAT DEFINE THE GENRE FOR METAL PEOPLE!!!!!  METALCORE AND MELODIC DEATH METAL MAY SOUND ALIKE BUT IF THE LYRICS ARE TALKING ABOUT HACKING PEOPLE UP OBVIOUSLY ITS MELODIC DEATH METAL.  IF THE LYRICS ARE ABOUT LOVE, OR SOME OTHER EVERYDAY PROBLEM BUT THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE DEATH METAL, NO ITS METALCORE.  ANYWAYS METALCORE IS WAY BETTER THAN NU METAL SO QUIT BASHING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! METALCORE ONLY MAKES BLACK/DEATH METAL MORE POPULAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000H0MKOC|1.0|Thank You for Smoking, although clever and funny, was about as poorly conceived as an apologia for the KKK. (Not that it hasn't been done!) Hollywood makes movies good, not good movies. And this film is a prime example of that maxim: good set-up, good actors, good directing, good camera work...bad movie.<br /><br />Now, before you get all hot and bothered about the fact that I didn't like a movie that you thought was funny and cute, stop and think for a minute. What makes a movie good? Is it the special effects? The visuals? The cute female (male) lead? The fact that you laughed? Well, no, actually. (Although all those things help.) What makes a movie good is the IDEA behind it. And this movie was based on a very bad one.<br /><br />If you watch the special features, you'll hear a lot of people say that this movie is about \\"spin.\\" That's pure spin. The movie (if you pay close attention to what the director says) is about \\"political correctness.\\" In this case, since you are rooting for the \\"bad guy\\" (an amoral liar and all round despicable person), and boo-ing the \\"good guy\\" (the be-sandaled Senator from Vermont), the \\"correctness\\" part can be argued. Is it merely politically correct to try and curtail smoking? Is it on a par with saying \\"physically challenged\\" or \\"differently abled\\" rather than disabled or crippled? No, it is not. It is a hard, proven fact that cigarettes do indeed kill, that the tobacco lobby doesn't give a rodent's derriere about that, and that any laws passed through the efforts of lobbyists (like the protagonist of this film) will cause you direct and personal harm.<br /><br />The other reason this film is bad is that it simply didn't work as a film. You can't make a feel-good movie about a man who is immoral. The teary-eyed Child who loves and supports Dad doesn't make you feel all warm and fuzzy. Instead you feel like slapping him, as much for the sentiment as for the stilted, all too adult-sounding, and blatantly expository lines he is forced to deliver. There is no godly reason for us to feel good about the son, or about the ex-spouse for that matter, who somehow, inexplicably decides to support her ex-hubby in the end. No, a plot like that only works if the main character comes through with a change of heart. And this one didn't.<br /><br />Two thumbs down on this one. If you want to see a GOOD movie about spin, watch \\"Wag the Dog.\\"godly reason for us to feel good about the son, or about the ex-spouse for that matter, who somehow, inexplicably decides to support her ex-hubby in the end.

B00008GKEG|4.0|Simply fantastic to see all the great footage of these cultural superheroes/deities. And unlike what you get in many musical documentaries, most of the songs here are played in their entirety.     Only complaint: the DVDs I got all came with English-language subtitles that cannot be removed; I'm assuming it's a defect in the product and not something wrong with my DVD player.

0618680004|1.0|Over 1000 reviews, most of them very positive (more than 5 stars). The book elicited an enthusiastic response among the converts. That is not surprising for such a partisan work. I recommend the critical reviews of Thomas Nagel for the New Republic and that of H. Allen Orr for the New York Review of books. I found Nagel's criticism particularly cogent. Yet, it's a third and more sympathetic review that, in my view, best summarizes the book. I'm referring to Steven Weinberg's review for the Times Online. At a certain point in the review, Weinberg complains: \\"I find it disturbing that Thomas Nagel in the New Republic dismisses Dawkins as an \\"amateur philosopher\\", while Terry Eagleton in the London Review of Books sneers at Dawkins for his lack of theological training. Are we to conclude that opinions on matters of philosophy or religion are only to be expressed by experts, not mere scientists or other common folk?\\" Of course, Dawkins and other scientists are entitled to write about anything they want but when they decide to write about topics outside of their area of expertise, shouldn't their opinions be taken less as those of an expert and more as those of educated common folk? Weinberg betrays in his statement what Dawkins exudes in the book: arrogance. I confess I find the style annoying. To pick on one example. Dawkins is eloquent in stating that his consciousness has been raised by Darwin. But, as Stephen Jay Gould once remarked, there are many evolutionary biologists that hold a very different view on religion and the supernatural. The names of Kenneth Miller, Francis Collins and Joan Roughgarden come to mind. Now, assuming that Dawkins has not been the only one raised to some lofty place, that is an interesting question, isn't it? Why is it that honest (let's keep wickedness out of the discussion) and intelligent people, scientists, looking at the same set of data inside their area of expertise subscribe to such completely different metaphysical perspectives?Are the data that much inconclusive? Is there such a thing as a \\"natural propensity\\"? What would that be? Genes? Lingering childhood experiences? I haven't seen a satisfactory explanation. Had Dawkins decided to tackle these questions in his book, I believe he would have written a much better one.

B000VUQ4HW|5.0|I just saw a sneak peak of this Kino DVD at the Tampa Theatre.  The picture is amazing!  My rating is for the restoration of the picture quality only.  We did not see the extras, and we had a live accompaniest on the organ (Rosa Rio, who is always fantastic); however, I do look forward to hearing the 1922 score that is inluded on the DVD.  As of the date of this writing, if you go to Kino's website, you can see a short video detailing some of the restoration of this film.
0316010669|5.0|No wonder this is a best seller. The author explains in an easy to follow way, the power of snap decisions and how they work. It shows how powerful and accurate instantaneous decisions can be, that we often are at odds to explain how we arrived at. Gladwell explains how these decisions are arrived at by the meticulous gathering of information by our unconscious.     However they are not always accurate and this is largely due to bias, such as stereotyping and prejudices. No doubt hormones play a role in that bias too, such as when people 'fall' in love and go on to marry that person. Gladwell here sites a number of studies by psychologist John Gottman, who discovered after studying thousands of interviews with married couples that he was able to tell with  95% accuracy whether a couple would remain together after 15 years from just observing an interview with a couple for 15 minutes.     An interesting book that makes one think about the powerful working of the unconscious and how to use it in beneficial ways.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|First let me say this is a great series, the last 2 seasons were not the best from it's series high in season 5, in both ratings and quality. But for those of us who love the show it's a must, unless we have bought the first 6 seasons already.     Is it worth getting them again just for a new box and booklet?     If there are no new video clips on the first 6 season then this is not for me. I'll save my money and just get the final season. But for those starting out this is the way to go.    Now the matter of the format, the final 4 seasons aired in 16:9 so will we finally get them on DVD in that format? The separate box sets for season 4-5-6 are not so will season 7 be any different?    I have read this was down to a decision from the previous show runner.    I have also read on one other site that the box set and season 7 will be 16:9, can someone clear this format issue up. I will only buy this box set if they have finally put the seasons that aired in 16:9 on the DVD in that format. Or if there is more than just the new booklet for the first 6 season.

0316018953|2.0|I have read everything Connelly has written and consider myself a big fan.  This book is a huge disappointment. Much of what I valued in the Bosch character had to do with his existential musings, his self-consideration, his revealed ideas about his role as a cop and his place in the world.  Little of that to be found here.  Perhaps this is the end of the Bosch franchise, which is probably not a bad thing at this point.<br /><br />It's as if Connelly bought some software whereby you enter the names of characters and a few nominal plot points, then it filled the rest in for him.  I also felt he exploited our current fixation on terrorism to sell some books.<br /><br />Sad to see Harry Bosch go out with a whimper, rather than the other way...

So much good stuff to watch...<br /><br />So happy to finally have this in my hot little hands. Aliens is still my favorite movie, bar none. In the sci-fi genre, [[ASIN:B0006GVJE4 The Fifth Element]] and the [[ASIN:B000EQHXN2 Riddick Trilogy]] have come close. But my loyalty will always remain with the first, and the best. Aliens (yes, I know Alien came first, but Aliens was the best-of-breed).
B000244EMO|5.0|I just saw this on the big screen yesterday and man, they don't make movies like this any more that's for sure. Sure we have realistic fight scenes in Bourne movies, James Bond etc nowadays but I really don't ever intend to be in a position where i am fighting a guy to death so realism like that doesn't appeal to me. Give me over the top 80s action anytime. From start to finish this is just a great movie, with fantasic action, great verbal sparring and one-liners, and terrific direction from one of the greatest action directors, John McTiernan (what a one-two punch - Predator in '87, Die Hard in '88). It's a guy's movie...let's just get that one out of the way. No girl in her right mind is going to sit through this (unless she is sent from heaven!). Total testosterone-fest with enough homo-erotic posturing and cigar-chomping to keep you laughing throughout. That said the suspense element of the movie is never compromised and it's never predictable. It's basically a slasher movie with a sci-fi twist and lots of guns and shooting (lot's of shooting!). It contains probably my favourite action scene in any movie - when they are firing into, and decimating, the woods after the Predator that they cannot see. I remembered it being a long scene, but in the cinema yesterday everybody was in shock with exactly how long it actually was, and there was laughter and cheering throughout. Just a totally crazy scene of Arnie and crew destroying the rain forest and I loved it! They may not have killed the Predator that time but they must have wiped a couple of species from the planet! Alan Silvestri music is excellent throughout and really helps build the atmostphere and tension. It's a lean movie, unlike most of Arnie's movies, and thank god, no cuteness or sensitive side to his character. Forget Terminator 3, they should have got Arnie back to take on Predator again. Hell, even have Arnie vs Predator vs Alien (He beat Superman & Batman in the preliminary round!). I could just imagine Arnie's house at the end of the movie, showing his friends around his trophy room with a Predator and Alien head on the wall. Arnie, you were one of the greatest and I, for one, miss you.
6305922756|5.0|Great idea, amazing writing and stellar acting.  Christoper Guest should have gotten an academy award for the work he did.  I just look at him in this movie and start laughing.  This has all the extras that you could want.    Hard to believe that the Stonehenge segment was actually based on a Black Sabbath story where the set was supposed to be in feet and the builder thought the numbers were in meters so the set was three times as large as it should have been.    Highly recommended for baby boomer, rock fans.  Others might not \\"get it\\".

B0002Y69NG|5.0|Best money I ever spent, aside from the [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien Quadrilogy (9-disc set)]]...<br /><br />When they say 10 discs, they're not kidding!<br /><br />They've got basically everything that's anything about the series on these discs. Though... I might note I haven't yet found the music-only audio track to The Matrix that was included on the original release. If they left that off, I'll be annoyed, as I really did think it was quite interesting / ethereal to watch the movie without dialogue, aside from occasional snippets from the music director. So far that's my only critique. Though I also wonder if they put in any easter eggs like the \\"follow the white rabbit\\" features from the original disc. If not, hopefully they at least included the clips those features led to... Considering there are like 6 special features discs (in addition to the matrix trilogy + the Animatrix), I'd hope they kept any/all original featurettes. So far I've barely scratched the surface of the Matrix.<br /><br />Anyway, if you love the series, you'll love the set. I only wish other series sets were so thorough!
6304708491|3.0|When &#34;Help!&#34; made its home-video debut in 1987, several critics overrated the film after its long absence from television and revival houses. Nostalgic memories can be deceiving. Despite the influential visual style, this 1965 Beatles romp lacks the charm and spontaneity of &#34;A Hard Day's Night.&#34; The paper-thin plot (a religious cult pursues Ringo for wearing a red-jeweled sacrificial ring) is no better than the typical Elvis musical. Strangely enough, director Richard Lester does not allow John, Paul, George and Ringo to dominate the proceedings. Instead, they share screen time with a fine array of British character actors (Leo McKern, Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill). Lester's cinematic freneticism eventually grows tiresome without a decent storyline. Nevertheless, the Fab Four's memorable numbers —  &#34;You're Going to Lose That Girl,&#34; &#34;I Need You,&#34; &#34;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&#34; and &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; —  remain historic music-video prototypes. Special praise should be given to David Watkin's Eastmancolor cinematography. Compared to the overall brilliance of &#34;A Hard Day's Night,&#34; the big-budget &#34;Help!&#34; survives as an erratic farce punctuated by magical Beatle moments.
B000294SFW|5.0|Inferno is the latest offering from Lemmy and the boys and they prove to be as blisteringly heavy as ever.  The current lineup consists of Lemmy on bass / vocals, Mickey Dee on drums, and Phil Campbell on guitars.  No it is not the classic lineup, but this album has an energy and relevance that really pushes it to the same level as some of the bands prime era.  Motorhead have been around for a long time and never achieved the fame and fortune that many of their followers did, but this album can stand up with just about any current metal band out there.  The playing is downright brutal at times and Lemmy's gruff voice sounds as good (or bad depending on your perspective) as ever.  The guitar work by Campbell is very good and Dee is solid on the drums.  The album is chock full of great songs, Terminal Show, Killers, In The Name Of Tragedy, Life's A Bitch, In The Year Of The Wolf, and Smiling Like A Killer are all great heavy rockers.  The band even closes the album with of all things an acoustic blues number called Whorehouse Blues.  Great stuff, and with Lemmy singing it, funny as hell.  I don't own a lot of Motorhead on CD, but every time I listen to this album it reminds me that I need to pick up more of their stuff.  When you just want to listen to some seriously heavy music and head bang a bit, this album is the perfect prescription.

If you have somehow made it this far without ever having seen The Matrix, be warned: The Matrix is extreme, extremly imaginative, and a good cast. It is about a nightmare future, which is so frightening that some betray their freedom to escape it. The Matrix is absorbing, well acted, and worth the time. If SCi Fi is not your bag, you might want to skip it.
B00005JMYI|5.0|We love this movie!  And it's great to be able to see the deleted scenes and bloopers from the movie.
1594489505|5.0|While reading the book you understand that suffering, love, hope and sacrifice have something in common.........they are the universal language of all human kind.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I'm a big fan of the first two movies so this entry is inevitable.    Did it live up to the promise? Well, I'm mixed on this. When the movie is good, it blows me away. The scenes of Sandman is amazing. His introduction was probably one of the best scenes in the entire Spider series. How it was shot, the special effects, the concept and emotion that resonates while he discovers what he's become is a cinematic accomplishment. The first fight scene between Goblin and Spiderman was also amazing. Topher Grace was a great addition in the cast, though Venom came out too late and there wasn't too much of him in the film. The amazing Bruce Campbell cameo is here again and his scenes are longer and funnier.    I think that's about it.    The movie at some point seem disjointed. Characters and events come and go, and the story doesn't flow as smoothly as the first two movies. I think most of my problems in the film could be solved by editing. For example, when Venom and Sandman met and joined forces, it sort of just happened. The scene was unnecessary. We all know they have a common enemy. Some of Peter's scenes with Aunt May could have been trimmed, they drag the movie and doesn't add much dramatic impact. The scenes of Parker with emo-hair bang dancing in a jazz club was awkward. I don't mind the dancing and the make-up, but the dancing was terrible (shouldn't Spidey be more flexible?).    I would say though that I still enjoyed it all in all. Its not the Spidermovie I want it to be, knowing this might be the last from Sam Raimi and his team, but I still enjoyed it. I think its time Sam Raimi puts his ideas into another effort. I'm still a big fan, and looking forward to what he will come up with next.
B000UO338W|5.0|If you are like me and haven't really listened to Ministry much since >Psalm 69&lt; you will most likely LOVE THIS ONE.  I am totally hooked and cannot stop this from circulation for the past couple months.  Some great work here much like the Psalm 69 era Ministry.  Al still may have some left in him, can't wait to see where he goes from here.
069111966X|3.0|I actually tried the techniques in this book while taking freshman physics at Harvard. They weren't all that helpful. I remember it sounding good, but being fairly useless when it came to attacking challenging textbook and recitation problems (which are a far cry from actual scientific questions). What I eventually learned was that the key to such so-called \\"problems\\" is to understand the problem writers and the choices they make. Polya operates in some idealistic and trivial world, as if being methodical were sufficient to win that game. People who find this book helpful may feel unprepared when they step it up a notch.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This is a record for all of those long standing fans of bands like Pantera that are wondering when the next great metal act might be.  Well, wait no longer go out and buy Five Finger Death Punch as you will be banging your head like you used to...
B00007KWHG|5.0|What's not to like about this album.  I regreted that I didn't buy any of their music \\"back in the day\\", but now I have a compilation of all my favorites from this talented group.  Love it!!
1400032717|5.0|I would like everyone to read this book. From being inside the head of this 15 year old boy with high functioning aspergers (the author has this diagnosis, so the book is very genuine) you learn so much about how humans communicate through abstract thought and emotion. You learn this because Christopher, the hero, can't do either (\\"Metaphors are lies.\\") And you learn the struggles of a very average family and the personal difficulties they have caring for a teenager with  this unusual \\"learning disability\\". But you also cheer and experience the terrors of a roller coaster ride as Christopher sets off on his \\"great adventure\\". Plus a realistic, as happy as could be expected, ending. Your life and relationships will be greatly enriched if you read this book.
1577314808|5.0|This book changed my life. I've been reading self-help and spiritual books for the past 5 years gradually awakening. This was the alarm clock  jolting my snoozing conciousness to wakefulness.     Now I laugh at my \\"inner voice\\" (mind/ego) when it starts talking to me. My life has completely turned around in the month since I read this book, and I feel a calmness and joy I never felt before. After more than 40 years, the battles with depression are gone.    Thank you, Eckhart Tolle.
0743298039|5.0|So many others before me have described the plot to this novel, so I must only write, as one who reads about 200 or more books a year, that this was one of the best fiction books that I have read in many a moon. Wonderful characters, a tightly-webbed plot and great writing really make this book a fabulous read---bizarrely hilarious and disturbing at the same time, The Thirteenth Tale grabs your attention to the very last word.
057506885X|5.0|This is an excellent Discworld novelette with marvelous illustrations that will fix in your mind what some of your favorite characters really ought to look like. When we last saw Cohen the Barbarian (a/k/a Genghiz Cohen), he was emperor of the Agatean Empire, having conquered it with the aid of his geriatric, six-man Silver Horde. Never one to rest on his laurels, however, Cohen and the Horde are on their way up Cori Celesti, the sky-scraping peak at the center of Discworld, to Dunmanifestin, the home of a multitude of gods. They're intending to return the fire stolen from the gods by Mazda tens of thousands of years before, in the form of an extremely potent batch of Agatean explosives. Meanwhile, Lord Vetinari, Patrician of far-off Ankh-Morpork, having discerned that such an explosion would derail magic at the Hub and thereby bring about the end of the world, has put his pet genius, Leonard of Quirm, on the case, as well as the talents of the wizards of Unseen University: Cohen must be stopped. Without Kidby's wonderful artwork -- especially his reproductions of Leonard's musings with a pencil -- this would be simply a good story about some of the denizens of Discworld. But with them, it's in another league altogether. I especially like the view of the Kite soaring beneath the world and between the legs of the elephants that support it, and the detail of the cabin of the great spaceship. Marvelous stuff.
B000UFAURI|5.0|The Foo Fighters busted out another great CD, better than the last double CD album by far, it has a few songs that give the band its edge, while at the same time the overtones of the CD are more melodic.  I love it, and think that there will be many a hit single released from this CD.
0810993139|5.0|My son likes to read, sometimes.  However, he picked up Diary of a Wimpy Kid and only put it down to sleep and shower...barely!  He has now read it three times and has gotten most of his friends hooked on it.  The last thing he was this excited about was his skateboard ramp.  I read it and was pleased to find good moral messages, proper language usage and entertaining content.  I highly recommend this book for any boy!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album/CD is in my all-time top 20. This coming from a cat who also puts Led Zeppelin - 3, RHCP - Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Stones - Exile on Main St., etc... in that list.    This release is beautiful. From beginning to end, it takes you through an array of emotion. And thats what music is supposed to do. Make you feel.    As a whole, I like this CD more than Mer de Noms. It actually makes more sense. Yes, Noms is great. In fact it's the album that turned me on to Tool, of which I adore.     But this thing is more powerful. Even the \\"slow\\" cuts get to you. They're hard in a attitude sort of way. Meaning, John Bonham only used 5 drums to convey his nessage...and it was hard.    I've been listening to this album for years, and it still finds it's way back into \\"regular\\" rotation. The hit, Weak and Powerless, is acually one of my least favorite songs.     The album literally leads you through a venture. And here is where I differ from most who ridiccule this album...    My current girlfriend of 4 years was coming out of her H addiction around the time I got into this music. ( thanks to God, she's still clean ) And upon first listening, every single note made sense.    Talk about making you feel...    I know The Outsider is an instant favorite for most upon first listen, as well it was for me. It's hard and in your face. But to me, I was that \\"guy\\".      And that's why the whole recording is special.    One can garner their own personal interpretation as the lyrics offer this.    Favorites:    - The Package  - The Noose  - Blue  - The Outsider  - Pet    And that's not to put down the rest of the CD. It is truly one of my all-time favs.    Best listning.
0142437611|5.0|The main character in Saul Bellow's novel is Tommy Wilhelm. He now lives with his father at the Gloriana Hotel in New York. Everything he has ever undertaken has gone wrong. He never managed to complete his studies. He was dragged to Hollywood by an old friend, Maurice Venice, who promised him a career as a film star with Kaskia Films. But then it turned out that Venice was simply a pimp and Wilhelm ended up by working in a restaurant in California. Later he married Margaret, he had two sons Paulie and Tommy and found a job with a company called Rojax Corporation. When he was dismissed his marriage broke up and Wilhelm's father's wrath reached the point when he refused to give his son a single penny.  When Wilhelm meets psychologist Dr Tamkin, he is drawn into speculation in commodities at one of the branches of a good Wall Street house. Wilhelm clings to the hope that his luck is about to turn - he has given the last of his money to Dr Tamkin. Is Tamkin ripping Wilhelm off or is he offering him one last chance to make it out of his mess?  A moving portrait of a man with sensitive feelings, a soft heart, a brooding nature and a tendency to be confused under the many pressures of life.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|I have seen the movie before I purchased it, and every time I watch it it is still as funny as it was the first time. I really enjoy it and I am very glad I own it. When I have kids I plan to raise them on old classics, and this is a perfect one. I would definately recommend it to everyone!
0142000671|5.0|In this short novel, Steinbeck chose two main characters. They are two wandering labourers, George Milton and Lennie Small. The former is the more intelligent one, a small and strong man with sharp features. The latter is rather a simpleton with a huge body and a shapeless face and he moves his feet like a bear moves its paws.  They both dream of saving enough money to buy their own modest farm but because Lennie is both clumsy and strong he always manages to get involved in some mischief wherever he can find some work. So George has to keep a constant vigil on Lennie - particularly when there are women around - in order to avoid disaster.  Steinbeck's remarkable achievement is to show in a short novel the pathetic way of life of two simple minded men and that of peasants in general in rural America in the 1930s. The dialogues are a delight to read because the author renders the characters' accent so accurately.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This is the 2nd Rita movie I've seen, and it just may be my favorite! Her first scene in the movie is the best, and most memorable. I'm a Rita fan, and I love this movie, its interesting and I enjoyed watching it. Its a must have classic!

0066620996|5.0|To All,  What a fantastic book with new thoughts in every chapter.  This book has been read and evaluated by everyone on our staff and it is encouraging to see so many positive responses.  This book will truly lift any lid you may currently have in your organization simply by understanding it is not a new program but a way of life.  If you only read one book this year, this is it.  If you want to understand the Hedgehog principal in church terms I reccomend, Simple Church.  These two books combined have made us evaluate and change our organization in ways that have taken 25 years of the same old same old to develop.  I highly recommend this book for any business, church, or person looking to start any venture in life.
B000000Y87|5.0|What intrigues me about the piano playing of Bill Evans is that he brought a hard driving attitude to classical forms. I can't imagine Evans' playing ever sounding out-dated. On this album, his rendition of Miles Davis' Solar can only be described as \\"Way out there.\\"
B00026WUAU|5.0|This is a very good album.  I consider it among some of the best of his masterpieces.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Well it's no surprise that the movie seeks to be like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films because the book is notorious for it's \\"borrowing\\" of themes and specifics from other authors' work, particularly Tolkien, LeGuin, and McCaffrey.  And just like the book, the movie quickly introduces ideas and then just as quickly abandons them.  Still, you can always turn lemons into lemonade and this could have been a reasonably good move....but it isn't.  So many things are so obvious to advance the plot that my jaw kept hitting the ground (EX: The dragon takes off in flight as a youngster and returns as a fully grown beast; The Irons character talks about how names of things relate to magic (LeGuin) and how difficult it is to master yet the young Eragon immediately and with no difficulty becomes a powerful wizard and warrior).    There is none of the struggle here that made Sam and Frodo so compelling. Eragon is like a kid who hit the Lotto who then skates along serenely while the film maker (and the author of the source material) handle the tough stuff for him.    Much of the film (especially the final battle sequence) is filmed darkly and is hard to see and the writing and acting is horrible.  Poor Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich to be stuck in such a dog........    Finally a comment about the Amazon review---they say that this movie is appropriate for younger viewers (how young they don't say) and family viewing.  That is borderline irresponsible.  Many of the scenes are too frightening and disturbing for younger viewers.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|To keep it plain and simple,real good stuff. Have been a fan of SOAD since the self-titled effort and knew Serge's album had to be worth the trip.From Empty Walls,The Unthinking Majority,Saving Us,The Sky Is Over,to Elect The Dead,it is real strong.Songs of emotion,offbeat and the always expected political views of Serge.It is good to see,no connection to Daron Malakian.It is a pure Serge \\"solo\\" effort.It will only make the next SOAD album something to look forward to. Anyway,highly recommended to any SOAD fan or Serge's songwriting techniques.A solid 4.5 stars.One of the better lead singer \\"solo\\" albums that has come out in a while.

B000URDEB0|4.0|okay....i've been following the band for quite some time. i have to admit that the previous singer's voice was one of the many selling points for me. now....having said that....after reading about the trials and tribulations of the band members....i decided to give this album, and the new lead singer a chance. additionally, i just saw the band in cleveland oct. 24, 2007....in what was a PACKED house. they pretty much would agree with this statement......\\"we wish tarja would have been there, because we loved her vocals....but annette was warm, melodic, and she and the band seemed to have a good time....and the album is very good\\". i would agree with previous reviewers.....this is a very good album. if you liked ONCE...you'll like this. there's even a few celtic flavored songs here. POET AND THE PENDULUM is an epic! this album grows on you the more you listen to it!     enjoy!!!

B00000K31Q|5.0|OMG. I love 10 things i hate about you. It's hilarious!     Spoilers: This boy named Cameron moves to a new school and develops a crush on Bianca Stratford. Too bad popular guy already likes her. Too bad Bianca's not allowed to date unless her sister does. Too bad her sister's a b****. So Cameron devises a plan. He tries to find someone so extreme that even Kat Stratford would go out with him, leaving Bianca open for a date.     They find this guy who ate an entire live duck and sold his liver on the black market for a new stereo. \\"Should you be drinking if you don't have a liver?\\" asks Cameron's dorky friend as they stumble upon said extreme guy. Kat falls for him, literally, after getting drunk at a party. At the same party, Bianca realizes she likes Cameron more. But she can't date him since Kat dislikes extreme guy after being turned down for a kiss.     I'll leave the ending up to you. But buy this movie! I loved it!

B00005JPRF|2.0|Reviews are funny things: you should really only pay attention to the ones written by people with the same mindset as you.  If you're not sure if this one qualifies, I'll say this -- I, a fan of the first two flicks, went to this movie with a friend who had never seen any of the Resident Evil films and who wasn't intrigued in the least by any descriptions of them.  \\"I fully expect to fall asleep,\\" was her response when we bought the tickets.<br /><br />Turns out, she enjoyed the film.  I did not.  That should tell you something right there.<br /><br />For those of you, like my friend, who don't know the Resident Evil mythos, a recap:<br /><br />THE FIRST MOVIE:  Umbrella Corporation.  Owns everything.  Run by men hungry for both power and money.  But mostly power.  They develop something called a T-Virus, designed initially as a biological weapon.  It turns people into zombies.  Whoops.  It gets loose in their top-secret research facility.  Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up, confused and mostly naked.  After gaining her senses and enough clothes to be reasonably decent (by gamer standards) she leads a team of security personnel in an attempt to gather up the survivors and any possible information that may lead to a cure for the T-Virus.  Alice makes it out of the hellhole and into the arms of Umbrella Corporation lackeys who immediately shoot her up full of drugs.  Before she can say thanks, she passes out.<br /><br />THE SECOND MOVIE:  Alice wakes up, confused and mostly naked, in a lab in Raccoon City, home of the Umbrella Corporation's top-secret research facility.  Whoops.  The virus has spread into the city.  The Umbrella Corporation has erected a large, unbreachable wall around the city, and everyone is shut inside.  The town is ordered to be nuked; they'll tell the rest of the world it was a fluke accident: someone left a fork in the microwave or something.  Alice leads a team of highly trained military personnel in an attempt to find a little girl and a way out of the very dangerous, very doomed town.  Along the way, she fights a critter named Nemesis, who is mostly made of neck.  She wins!<br /><br />THIS MOVIE:  Alice wakes up, confused and mostly naked ...<br /><br />Okay, so I like zombie movies.  There's little left in movies that really scares me anymore, but zombies almost always do the trick.  Maybe it's the metaphor of their mindless persistence.  Maybe it's the blood-soaked personification of herd mentality.  Maybe I don't like the idea of anyone or anything that operates independently of reason.  Whatever it is, since Romero first shocked the world with his Living Dead series, I've been a fan.  (And 2004's remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" for my money, is the most disturbing zombie film out there.)<br /><br />But RE:E?  Well, I'm not sure what to call it.  Zombie movie?  Eh.<br /><br />Sure, the T-Virus has spread.  The whole world has been infected.  Also, guess what?  It affects the soil and the water, too, so now most of the planet is desert.  It gets in the crows, and they go all bug-eyed.  In heavy doses, it causes rapid mutation.  And Alice?  Why, she's chock full of the stuff!  But in a good way.  In the kind of way that makes her able to do things that David Blaine can only dream of.<br /><br />Although they couldn't be called good cinema, the first two films were at least reliably dependant.  Maybe it's because they adhered so closely to the games upon which they were based.  Okay, so the formula is so rigid, viewers might find themselves looking for Life Remaining bars on the screen, but at least there were solid motivations, obstacles, and some level of sense.  Yes, some.  I don't cotton to the viewers who whine when the movies depart from the game script (seems a little odd to me, to seek theatrical validation for something you've spent hours memorizing on your own at home), but I do understand how those games can be the life blood of what is essentially a brain-dead premise.  Or maybe the games, in this metaphor, would be the T-Virus.<br /><br />Nevermind.  The point is, RE:E goes nowhere, and it goes there with as much herky-jerky senselessness as its undead cast.  A convoy of survivors is wandering the North American wasteland, basically driving away the time until they die.  Alice, alone, is doing likewise.  Dr. Issacs, a scientist at the Umbrella Corporation, is still running experiments, trying to find a cure for the T-Virus.  That seems like a pretty noble task, but the script goes to great lengths to establish him as a ridiculously evil person.  When he finds out that Alice is still alive, does he simply go to her and say, \\"Look, hey, sorry about all of the trying to kill you stuff.  And the zombie dogs.  And the neck monster.  Heh.  Guess we got carried away.  But, hey, the cure to it all might be in your blood, actually, and I was wondering ... uh, can I borrow a drop?\\"  Of course he doesn't.<br /><br />This is the movie's central conflict.  You might think it's about the convoy of survivors.  You might think it's about a possibly uninfected corridor of Alaska where everyone can go to find peace.  You might even think it's about a cure, a resolution, or some kind of curtain call on the whole dismal affair.  No.  What it's really about is a fourth film.  By the final frame of \\"Extinction,\\" you'll realize what I did: you just watched a two-hour prologue.  And it's not even that great of a prologue.<br /><br />If you're like my friend, maybe you'll see a kind of interesting flick with some neat fight scenes, one or two cool ESP moments, and an ending that is as canned as the food served to the convoy's dwindling members.  At least you'll see something that's better than bad, which was what my friend was expecting.<br /><br />If you're like me, with hopes a little further north, prepare to be let down.  This film is full of the false scares and sudden bangs that make up all the cheap thrills of most horror films; I'll admit I jumped a few times at the start.  But by the end, the thrills were gone, and all that was left was the cheap.  I'm not sure what this means for the next film coming.

B0001932ZA|5.0|Running Man, staring Arnold The Great, is set in 2017. So, basically this means that we're only 10 years away from a totalitarian society that censors everything and makes the only option on tv a wierd game show that pits gladiators against each other in hopes of creating a fair justice system. Now, hopefully by 2017 Arnold will be able to forge documents proving he was born in the U.S. so he can be president and save us from this terrible fate. Because even criminals may not deserve to be sent to Jessie \\"The Body\\" Ventura in lieu of the electric chair.<br /><br />Of course, in Running Man Arnold is wrongly accused and Richard Dawson forces him to fight in this sick game show. As we all know, the role of game show host is one of only two roles Dawson can play. The other? Perenial to catch a predator all-star. Now, let's get to the concept of the future in this movie. Apparently in 10 years, we will all be reverting back to 80's hair and wearing costumes that look like we strapped a lite-brite to our chest. For the dress alone, this movie is a classic. But what put Sid the Elf over the top on this one, you ask? No, not Arnold in a spandex singlet, but the surprising number of quality soundboard lines. This flick provides a great abundance of what makes Arnold the Great...great. His hillarious speech patterns!<br /><br />So, if you love Arnold as much as Sid does, watch Running Man. He kicks butt all over the place and is hillarious as usual. That's why Arnold is on his way to the all-time record of movies with the Sid the Elf seal of Approval.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|This album is tricky......  If you are a first timer to electronica or daft punk this album is not for you. If you are a fan of daft punk you will either love this or hate it. Like with anything daft punk does they always try something different for every album they pump out. Most people claim that the album is repetitive and boring. What people forget is that this album is more of a statement than a album. When daft punk made this album they were trying to find where human emotions reside in music or something like it.   This album is very hard to like but if you keep listening to it, after awhile it starts to grow on you.     If you have listened to their past hits and are thinking about buying this then I would suggest that you wait for ALIVE 2007. You will probably like these songs alot more mixed up with other hits live than in 5min repetitive loops.
6305546789|5.0|Folks, today we, Sid the Elf, are reviewing Halloween. This will not be our typical review because Halloween deserves a respectful review with no make-up. This film is so well-done that every scene has a scare in it. This includes the opening credits that shows an innocent looking jack-o-lantern against a black backgroung while the Halloween theme plays ominously tempting you to turn the lights back on. Seriously, if you don't believe us, watch this movie from  tap to buzzer the right way with no lights, popcorn, candy and the rest of the important food groups. If you get lucky and it's a chilly, windy October night during your screening you will get at least a little freaked out.<br /><br />So, Halloween is centered around a small Illinois town, Haddonfield. It is typical Anytown, USA. But, in 1963, the star of our show, Michael Myers, then 6 killed his sister on...that's right, Halloween night. He is then inevitably sent to live in a mental institution. Flash forward to October 30, 1978. Michael's doctor, Dr. Loomis, arrives at the mental hospital to take Michael to trial. What he finds is the patients roaming the grounds in the pouring rain. Of course, Myers has broken out to be free to return to Haddonfield for a Halloween rampage.<br /><br />Now, what ensues are some of the creepiest nuances in horror film history. Myers ends up stalking Jaimie Lee Curtis and her friends for his next victims. That is all status quo in horror. What isn't is that Myers knows where Curtis is at all times. He appears quickly and disappears even faster. She sees him behind a curtin outside her house, does not look away and he's just gone the next instant. Oh, did we mention his appearance? He's wearing black cover-alls and a stark white expressionless mask. If you try to put yourself in her shoes it's scary. You have no idea who this guy is, or why he's in your path.<br /><br />Eventually, he gets to Curtis' friends and kills them. When he kills Bob, he just stares at him to watch him die. When he finally gets to Curtis, she fights back. She stabs him with a knitting needle in the neck, a wire hanger in the eye, and a knife to the chest...Ah, finally over. So we see Curtis(completely spent) sitting against the door frame. Myers is laying with a knife in his chest across the room. Then, in Sid's opinion, the single scariest moment in film history, Myers sits srtaight up, and turns his head to look at Curtis. He catches her, starts strangling her, but she pulls off his mask just as Dr. Loomis enters the room after hearing screaming. He shoots Myers SEVEN times causing him to fall out of a second-story window. When Loomis looks down to the ground to catch a final glimpse at his long-time patient, Myers is gone. Theme music ensues, final shot is of Curtis sitting on the floor crying at the realization that this indestructable force of evil who had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes is still after her.ly gets to Curtis, she fights back.

B000MQC9H4|2.0|Movie making and politics have grown remarkably similar.  In both cases, products are packaged not on merit - much less vision - but on marketability.  Candidates don't bravely craft innovative platforms and then sell their merits to the public, they simply figure out what the public wants to hear and then devise catchy ways of saying it.  Likewise, many filmmakers avoid artistic risk and creativity, settling instead for products that will sell.  Nancy Meyers, who wrote and directed The Holiday, has clearly targeted women as her market, particularly women who are drawn to frothy, weepy, dim-witted romanticism and sentimentality.  In What Women Want, she actually hit some high notes.  In The Holiday, poor writing, a clich&eacute; fiesta, plot predictability, and ham-fisted direction combine to make a vacation from reality certain to have you craving home.<br /><br />Among the film's innumerable flaws is the high percentage of \\"movie jobs,\\" - not to be confused with real jobs that real people pursue.  Everyone has pots of money and works as a journalist, book editor, popular writer, movie trailer editor, movie score composer, hot air balloonist, or itinerant Marcel Marceau impersonator.  Amanda, Cameron Diaz, lives in a house so ostentatious it would embarrass Pablo Escobar.  Those looking for a shred of reality should look elsewhere.  The premise - swapping houses and lives with an absolute stranger - is equally far-fetched.  Though it is an actual practice, it's unlikely to happen at the drop of a hat as it does here.<br /><br />Plenty of eye candy, which helps to make the interminable 135-minutes running time slightly less unforgivable, the English countryside is appealing.  The cast is top shelf, and manages to create some good moments despite the appalling script.  Jude Law is excellent, and Cameron Diaz is not far behind.  Many appealing moments between these two, especially discovering the \\"Tent.\\"  There is real tenderness and depth in seeing Graham, Law, and his two young daughters with Amanda; Graham is now revealing the entirety of his life to Amanda, and Amanda is finally getting an idea of love as commitment, not merely entertainment.  The Holiday could have used more moments like this.<br /><br />Most puzzling is how the other shoe is never quite dropped, Iris, Kate Winslet, is completely wasted in this film.  She's a pro, and makes the most of what's there, but there ain't much there, there.  If the film had really explored the trading houses/trading lives idea, the Iris story would have to mirror the Amanda story, be just as strong, and intersect with it in surprising ways.  It does none of these things - indeed, Eli Wallach almost shuffles away with the L.A. part of the picture because nothing is happening.  Jack Black is horribly miscast, in fact, just how did Jack Black make it into show business in the first place?<br /><br />Men will dismiss this movie out of hand as sentimental twaddle.  But I like to think that women viewers understand they're being pandered to and will respond by asking, \\"Does Hollywood really believe we're this shallow?\\"with Amanda; Graham is now revealing the entirety of his life to Amanda, and Amanda is finally getting an idea of love as commitment, not merely entertainment.

0007205236|4.0|In Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes, McCourt reveals the struggles of living through the Depression in Ireland. With an alcoholic father and a mother who was disgraced for marrying an Irish man from the North, Frank McCourt fights to live and earn enough money to go to America. McCourt's style of writing and his willingness to admit stealing make this memoir a unique heart-wrenching story.    Throughout the memoir McCourt interjects song lyrics into his writings. The song lyrics give life and imagery to the scenes. Frank and his family do not know where their father is until they hear him \\"rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a gigil keep, the West's asleep, the West's asleep...\\" (77). This description allows the reader to picture a drunk father stumbling through the dark streets of Ireland while his family waits for him, desiring to eat and go to sleep.     When Frank's mother becomes a beggar his schoolmates chant, \\"Frankie McCourt, beggar woman's boy, scabby-eyed, dancing, blubber-gob, Jap\\" (250). These lyrics explain the tormenting Frankie receives from his schoolmates and the impact of a boy living in poverty.     In order to survive while living in poverty, McCourt reveals the crimes he committed as a child and creates a strong ethos. When Frank's family has no food and his mom is moaning for lemonade, he decides to \\"stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession\\" (236). When his family is in need of coal, Frank believes he and his brothers can \\"climb over the walls and take what we want\\" (239). McCourt's honesty and confession of stealing gives Frank a strong ethos and enables the reader to imagine Frank's fight to stay alive.     Thankfully Frank McCourt was able to survive through the Depression in Ireland, or else we would be without this great memoir. McCourt's memoir effectively uncovers the harsh realities of living in poverty.
0312330537|5.0|In a world of fast-food reading, this one is a true, rare delicacy. The full 933 pages makes you work for it. But if after 13 years and 3 re-writes, the author still manages to put it on paper and write a book this size, there's something he wants to say. You'll be greatly rewarded reading this book! From the moment I read the opening paragraph I was hooked. He takes you places most of us will never see and shares his intimtimate stories of love, loss, and friendship and through his dark tales of drug addiction, violence, and organized crime. Through it all, he connects with his readers and gives them one tremendous, thrilling story!
B000E1JOSE|3.0|I bought the dvd. Loved the music. Roy's voice and performance were wonderful. However, the grainy quality of the video closeups on Roy was distracting and Bruce Springsteen's mugging and general leaping around the stage trying to upstage Orbison were close to disgusting. Buy the cd only!
6305903182|3.0|Scream 3 is the most disappointng of the triology and I am very happy they stopped after this one. Directed once again by Wes Craven, Scream 3 has all the same cliches as the first two and although the twists were sharp and witty, you just felt cheated and let down by the Hollywood style ending. The house explosion scene is the best of the entire series I have to admit but casting Jenny McCarthy and Parker Poser it's like just kill them already! Scott Foley who I like on Felicity, plays against type in this one, you can see him struggle tremendously. Scream 3 overall isn't awful, it's just the weakest of the series.
B000055ZB8|4.0|As mentioned, This Review Pertains to the 2001 Image Entertainment edition only...I do not own or care to own the Kino version, which maybe longer[...] one version is all I need, and this version is good enough for me.  It is by far very different then the 1931 Bella Dracula version...and more scary too.  I love to watch different era's of film to compare things with like the 1931 Dracula and this silent Nosferatu film.   Lighting - special effects, camera techniques, etc.   Acting also was rather different from the silent era to the talkey era.  I took a film history course in High School - and this is one the films mention about, but never showned, since when I was in school, they did not have Nosferatu available on video at that time.   There was a picture of the movie in the history books, but that was all.
B00005NRO3|4.0|Scream 2 is just as good as the first one but of course it's not a slam dunk. Of all the Scream films, I can say I never guessed right when it came to picking out who the killers were. Director Wes Craven does a wonderful job with keeping the ending fresh and surprising. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette keep this film together, their acting is comical but serious when it needs to be. Isn't a perfect sequel but hey most sequels aren't anyways. Defintely one to rent.

B00004THAY|3.0|This is somewhere between 3 & 4 stars for me, it has some great moments, but overall doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The good first:<br />There is some lovely blues on here and its all well played by Clapton and King with a supporting cast of top notch musicians. These includes Steve Gadd, Joe Sample, Nathan East, Jimmie Vaughan and Andy Fairweather Low. The best tracks are the two semi-acoustic tracks 'Key to the Highway' and 'Worried life Blues' and the romping 'Days Of Old'. This track in particular is reminisant of some B B Kings swinging earlier material. A great track.<br /><br />The not so good:<br />For my taste, with exception of about five tracks, its a little over-produced. For what is a essentially a blues album its all just a little to clinical for me, and reading the credits for the tracks you will find that on 10 of the 12 Paul Waller is credited with 'Drum programming'. Now that I just don't understand. I have no doubt that Paul Waller is a talented man (you have to be to work in this company) but why do you need a 'drum programmer' (whatever that is) when you have Steve Gadd anyway?<br /><br />So overall this is a good album, certainly worth getting, but there are better blues albums out there.
0930289528|5.0|I have never read a graphic novel, till this one. I saw the movie and decided to read the novel. The movie was a five out of five and it is only half as good as this book. The book is eerily familiar to today's political climate, despite the fact it was written twenty years ago. A must read for any comic hero fan.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Luc Bessons Leon is a spellbinding story of a Hitman and a young girl. The hitman 'Leon' is played by Jean Reno and 'Matilda' by Natalie Portman. Both are brilliant. The other major role in the film goes to Gary Oldman as the corrupt and psychotic Policeman 'Stansfield'. Oldman is typically over the top, but in this film it felt right.<br /><br />The detail of the relationship between Leon and Matilda is left implied but unstated directly. It may be sexual, despite Matilda being underage, but somehow you accept that their relationship works. Although Matilda is the innocent because of her age (12), Leon appears on some level to be an innocent or simpleton as well. He is a deadly hitman, but he is being ripped off by the man who organises the jobs for him, and I never got the impression that he had a grip on anything other than how to kill people.<br /><br />This is all done beautifully. Scene after scene will stay with you: The opening where Leon goes to visit the 'Fatman'. The early rampage by 'Stansfield' at the apartment when Matildas father is in trouble over drugs. The scene in the toilet at the Police Station. I could list a dozen memorable scenes quite easily.<br /><br />One thing worth mentioning is that although a lot of bullets fly during this film, there are really no special effects, and yet it is effortlessly more entertaining than say Mission Impossible III (a random pick of a recent blockbuster) which is full of CGI effects and explosions. In Leon you care about the characters beacuse the script is good (the music is also an inportant factor as well). This film will affect you and despite the violence, and occasional black comic moments, you may well end up crying.<br /><br />The longer version presented here has a fair amount of additional material, most noteably a much longer sequence where Leon is training Matilda. I have seen this version and the shorter version released in the UK and rate both versions equally highly.
0930289234|5.0|This is my second graphic novel and it won't be my last. I found myself reading this novel every spare minute I had. I was reluctant to put it down and go to work. If you want your definition of hero re-written, then this book is for you.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|Burt Lancaster gives one of his greatest ever performances in 'The Swimmer'. The plot is simple, Ned (Lancaster) decides to swim his way home via the swimming pools of his wealthy friends and neighbours. As his journey progresses it becomes apparent that all is not what it seems.<br />Lancaster was 55 when this film was made and he is in fantastic shape...<br /><br />Only at the very end of this film did I begin to understand the subtle hints that the other characters had been giving at all along. The ending is arguably one of the finest in film history. It is totally unexpected and unless you have read the book or a detailed film synopsis it will probably be so for you.<br /><br />I would concede that this film will not be to everybodies taste. Some may consider it pretentious, and perhaps just plain dull, so if you can rent it first or watch it on TV before buying it would probably be wise to do so.
B000000W5F|5.0|My apologies to any vegetarians out there for the title - my wife's a vegetarian, but that's just what came to mind when trying to come up with a review title.  OK, I'm going to yak about sax playing for quite a bit here so skip this review if ya just ain't interested.<br /><br />First off, a \\"little gristle\\":  The great tenor saxophone \\"Colossus\\" (pun intended, see Sonny's discography if you don't get it) played on two, possibly three cuts on this release and yet, the man is not credited.  What?!  For those of you who are not jazz fans, this was a MAJOR coupe!  Getting the man who is widely believed to be the greatest living tenor sax player (and most important next to John Coltrane) to play on a rock-n-roll CD?  Man, that is unheard of and is un-duplicated in the history of rock music.  I would have thought the Stones would want to brag about this and also, that the publicity surely wouldn't hurt Sonny's career or marketability.  I'd love to read the back story on this event. OK, enough of that.  Well, maybe more on this a little later.<br /><br />Tattoo You doesn't have ANY tracks that I'd call filler or stinkers.  Now that IS surprising giving a lot of this stuff is re-worked rejects from earlier Goats Head Soup, Black and Blue, and Emotional Rescue.  I think this release is actually very superior to all three of those.  Maybe the opportunity to revisit material helped make it stronger.  I do a lot of composing myself and find this is often the case.<br /><br />Now, back to our CD.  Though it's \\"all meat\\" (tastes like chicken), there are some tracks on Tattoo You that in my opinion are clearly superior to the rest of the material.  Do I even have to mention \\"Start Me Up\\"?  Good God, what an anthem these guys penned.  I never get sick of hearing it.  I also love the live version on \\"Flash Point\\".  In addition to \\"Start Me Up\\" we get the funky groove of \\"Slave\\" supposedly recorded during the \\"Black and Blue\\" sessions with certain musician's parts erased (like the then always obnoxious Jeff Beck for instance).  The jazz tenor sax virtuoso Sonny Rollins performs on \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" (a fact that, as a very informed jazz listener, I find amazing).  \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" has long been a Stones favorite of mine, possibly my very favorite Stones tune depending on what day it happens to be.  But back to \\"Slave\\", I've read Rollins also played on this tune, but I'm not so sure that's him.  As soon as I heard that tenor sax solo on \\"Slave\\", especially the incredible control playing in the extremely high register, I thought MAYBE that was Rollins horn, it sure isn't Bobby Keys, that's for sure.  I've read Rollins plays on \\"Neighbors\\" as well but, again, I'm not so sure that is Sonny Rollins playing there.  It doesn't sound as \\"burlesque\\" and \\"bar walking\\" as Bobby Keys' playing but it doesn't sound like Mr Rollins either.<br /><br />Enough of the saxophone commentary!  I also think \\"Heaven\\" is particularly strong though some don't seem to like it I think it has a very haunting groove thing going on.  Yeah, I like Heaven a lot.<br /><br />Heck, it's all great stuff, just some is a little greater than others.<br /><br />My only complaint about this terrific sounding re-issue and the other Virgin remasters (remastered by Bob Ludwig in 1994 with Apogee's superb UV 22 encoding) is it would be nice to know who actually played on the tracks (you can supposedly get this information on the Wikipedia of course but that brings us back to those Sonny Rollins arguments of mine - I think the Wiki has this wrong) - Hey, I bet Mick Taylor once wished he could see the credits as well.  There is nothing in the way of liner notes.  Guess Virgin is saving that for the classic re-issue series once sales start dropping off again.s Jeff Beck for instance).

0307387178|5.0|I read this because of my respect for Jon Krakauer that I gained from his book \\"Into Thin Air.\\" Krakauer has always been among the \\"gifted story tellers\\" of our day, but this book places him solidly in a peerless terrain - he reaches the struggle of the human soul with this story. McCandless is derogatorily looked upon by some and practically worshipped by others, but Krakauer balances these extremes and thus forces us to look within ourselves for the interpretation of events. I contend that this book could well be placed among the cadre of great classics such as \\"Anna Karenina\\" and \\"War and Peace.\\" The boon for the reader is that it can be grasped with a mere few hours invested, as opposed to days for these others - he strikes the same soul struggles with clarity and efficiency. I contend that McCandless lived more of life in his two short years after college than most of us will experience in our lifetimes - he saw more desert sunsets, more river rages, more brushings with great beasts of the wild, more \\"mind-numbing skies\\", than an office full of us \\"conventionalist\\" will ever imagine. ENJOY - AGAIN and AGAIN. Behold one who \\"DARED TO LIVE.\\"    John Z
B000000W5H|4.0|There are tunes I like on It's Only Rock-n-Roll but there's only a couple that I would call truly memorable.  The title track is a classic (of course) and think my 2nd favorite is the funky \\"Fingerprint File\\".  There's something about \\"Time Waits For No One\\" that just doesn't grab me... maybe it's Taylor's Santana-esque lead playing on this one?  It doesn't sound right to me - and I am a Taylor fan, especially his solo on \\"Can't You Hear Me Knockin'\\" from Sticky Fingers.  \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" is... well, it's a rocker, and another good track.  The rest of the CD is really pretty forgettable for me, in fact, I have trouble recalling how some of these sound and I just finished listening to it earlier today.  IORR is worthy of a place in any Stones collection but I wouldn't call it vital or essential.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I went to IMAX theater to watch this film: even it wasn't IMAX experience, i enjoyed it a lot since it's a \\"titanic\\" production an it needed \\"gianourmous\\" screen.    Then, the only way i could re-live the experience (Well, sort of...) was Blu ray and a big enough 1080p LCD along with one god home theather setup (Like mine XD): it was worthy to watch again.    Epic movie needs epic media (And good HD stuff)    Haven't got your copy? what are you waiting for! A must buy Blu ray        Esta película fuí a verla a una pantalla IMAX y aunque no fuera experienca imax, era necesario contar con una pantalla enorme para disfrutar esta producción épica. Lo disfruté muchísimo.    La única manera de volver a vivir la experiencia (bueno, lo mas parecido) fué a través de blu ray y una pantalla LCD 1080p lo suficientemente grande que estuviera acompañada de un buen teatro en casa (Como el mío XD): Valió la pena volverla a ver.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I purchased the series on DVD and watched it for the first time just a few weeks ago.  Upon completion, I went out and immediately bought this!  It's basically a long episode...  The characters are all there, and complete with a great story (unfortunately, Shepard Book didn't have a big roll in the movie.)  Through out the series, River had very little to do with the show.  She was there, and she had an interesting back-story, but only a few episodes really involved her.  I was really pleased that they put the spot-light on her in this film.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|An amazing buy. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and the overall feel is wonderful. This makes you really marvel at all the wondrous creations of Nature.

B00005Y228|5.0|at a Fever pitch.  Only needed one listen through with this cd to know that i'm all about and love me some Kylie.  I have liked her as an artist for awhile now this is the first cd that i've bought of hers.  But the way its going it wont be the last.  It is seriously addictive and requires your full attention to get all thats happening on the cd.  Its all about having fun, dancing and just doing you.  Each track has a crazy beat and is something that should be played before going to a club or out on the town as it gets you in the mood for the night ahead.  The only real slow track is \\"Burning Up\\" and even thats not really a slow song.  But its the closest to anything like it on the cd.<br /><br />Obviously the track folks will know is \\"Can't Get You Outta My Head\\" as it received lots of airplay and video play here in the States.  It's just a tiny sliver of what the rest of Fever is like and it needs to be bought or downloaded (Itunes).<br /><br />Enjoy i know i did and still am.

B000F1IQN2|2.0|Lotta graphic violence. Lotta graphic sex. Tough, sad subject matter. I thought Mr. Spielberg did a good job showing these guys had a conscience, Eric Bana can act and does accents very well, but I just didn't enjoy the movie.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|If you like Mark and/or if you like Emmylou, you can't pass this up. It's a great album.
B000J103PC|2.0|Meryl Streep looks like she's have a great time getting to act so vicious, and somehow she manages to make her character believable throughout.  I figure Anne did the movie for the free high-fashion clothing.  I was highly disappointed in Anne's main character.  They try to show her character has spunk and drive and faithfulness, but she just took the abuse too long for my liking, and her one-night stand was too easily passed over.  Not a total bomb of a movie, but not all that great either.
B000002H6C|5.0|Ok, I'm not a huge fan of thrash metal. I'm pretty conventional when it comes to music. In my opinion, this album is Metallica's best effort. Prior to this you had some decent songs, but the production was horrible (sounds like they were recorded in a garage). After this album, they turned from a metal band into a mainstream hard rock band with the Black album.    This album brought out the best in their technical music skills, topped of their lyrical dramatic themes, and is just beautiful sounding uncompromised songs. I feel that good music transcends genres and if there is any album that could draw people with good ears into true metal, it is this album. It not only showcases technical ability (as many thrash albums do), but it showcases real musical talent.
B00005JLRT|3.0|Not the best Star Trek TNG film, but good to see the cast together one more time (and it's probably their last). Like the \\"Insurrection\\" film, it felt like an elongated episode of the series. Of all of the TNG movies, I still think \\"First Contact\\" was their best. As for \\"Nemisis\\", good special effects and a few laughs. Sad to see them go, but, as they say, all good things . . . .

B000M341QE|4.0|This gangster movie shows off Leo DiCaprio's amazing acting ability.  His tortured, but good-hearted character just made you want to root for him throughout.  I don't think \\"The Departed\\" necessarily deserved the best pic oscar, but Leo should have gotten the best-actor award.  As for Jack Nicholson, can he play any other character?  I'd really like to see him try.  Matt Damon was so unbelieveable.  I can believe Matt as Jason Bourne, but this cardboard character in \\"The Departed\\" just fell flat.  So IMHO, it was Leo's show all the way.
0743201140|5.0|I came into this book series backwards. Started with \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" and read this one second. Probably not the best way for most people, but works for me.I like the positive/strengths better than culture's negative/weaknesses approach. I see a connection between my Gallup strengths and my Meyers-Briggs personality strengths. I'm not a manager, supervisor or leader type, so I'm using the information only on a personal level. Reading and understanding both \\"go\\" and \\"now\\" has helped me stop wasting energy trying to be a \\"better person\\". Intuitively I knew that focusing on my weaknesses is futile. But it's always nice to have research to back us up and feel that we're not alone in our thinking.
B000F3UAFC|3.0|Beautiful setting, and wonderful acting by Helen Hunt and Tom Wilkinson.  Nice adaptation of Oscar Wilde's \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" with interesting plot twists and witty banter.  And though an adult drama, it has more \\"suggestion\\" than the modern movies that usually leave nothing to the imagination.  I felt we learned the story of these people without having to know all of their intimate details.  Hallelujah.  One of the fun lines:  \\"You've been buying into idle gossip.  I suggest you ask for a refund.\\"
B000IMUYJM|2.0|OK  WHAT  WAS  THE  WRITER  OF  THIS  MOVIE  THINKING?  NO  PLOT,  NO  EXPLAINATION  OF  ANYTHING....WHY?  IF  YOU  GET  SCARED  DURING  HORROR  MOVIES  DONT  WORRY  YOULL  BE  FINE.  THERES  NOTHING  TO  THIS MOVIE.  DONT  WASTE  YOUR  2  HOURS.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Very quirky. Very colorful. Lots of imagination. But weird. Johnny Depp did a good job with what he was given. I was never a fan of the original movie, so I was looking forward to something new. Adding Wonka's back-story gave it an even darker side. I'd recommend this movie only to 7 to 11 year old boys that like gooey, gross stuff.
006085880X|2.0|I sobbed my way thru this book, unable to put it down yet feeling so miserable I wished I could.  It's very well crafted, yet I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for emotional pain.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Very, very, very, very, very, very violent story to force us to open our eyes to the tragedy happening in Africa: evil men terrorizing their own people for the lust of greed. 'Evil triumphs when the good people remain silent'. I look forward to the day when the good people of Africa will stand up to them. Leo DiCaprio is going to get a well-deserved oscar some day, if not for this movie, for another. He's so talented, believable, and puts himself fully into the character. Even his accent was right-on. Gave 4 stars, because of the acting and because the point of the story is to wake us up from our slumber. I can't say I totally enjoyed the movie. But I can say I woke up.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This is one of the few movies I've actually spent money on. Leon is definitely my favorite movie of all time. Go into it with no expectations and see where it takes you. Just wow. I can watch it over and over easily. I won't say anything else because I'm sure others have already said enough.    Getting the uncut version(\\"Leon) is a no brainer if you have a brain. You should get the American Version(\\"The Professional\\") if you have a low IQ though. Unless you can comprehend the story fully you won't appreciate it.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|A sweet coming-of-age movie set in Victorian times, beautifully acted by Renee Zellweger (sans makeup), Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson. Heart-wrenching but life-affirming, I enjoyed the mostly-true story of Beatrix Potter, author and illustrator of the Peter Rabbit books. No big laughs, but some good cries and beautiful scenery. I recommend it, especially for those who like anything English.
B00005JPWH|5.0|Sean Penn, who has proven himself to be an accomplished and intense actor, takes the director helm just as seriously.  His vision of Chris McCandless's life (via Jon Krakauer's book `Into the Wild') is simply stunning.  While most pictures that go outdoors give you some breathtaking scenes, this film makes the close shots of formidable and forbidding nature a staple element throughout the movie.  Having just watched the movie at a local cinema with a smaller screen, I was content, not needing a big screen TV or a visit to the I-Max.  To sustain a story and an outdoor adventure for nearly two and a half hours is a feat unto itself, but the characters and reflections are satisfying enough to take the audience to its destination.    Besides Penn's perfectionism, we have a fine story told well.  Starting with Chris's real life journal, we go back and forth from his well-to-do family back to his destination on the outskirts of Fairbanks, and then trace back his journey along the way until he reached his destination.  Chris had all the trappings of success.  An \\"A\\" student with a wealthy family to help him along the way, something was, nevertheless, missing.  To fill in the gaps, his sister (Jena Malone) narrates part of the story, telling us about the family he left behind.  Then, he encounters all kinds of people from the working class farmers of South Dakota, to a latent hippie couple in Arizona, to a retired military man in California.  Like road stories from films like `Easy Rider' [[ASIN:B000022TSY Easy Rider]] to books like Kerouac's `On the Road,' [[ASIN:0140283293 On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)]] this is a high caliber road movie, even if the destination is off the beaten path. With all its grandeur and absorbing development, this movie reminded me of the truly excellent 'Never Cry Wolf,' [[ASIN:B0001I55Y2 Never Cry Wolf]] which this film has easily trumped.        Trouble is Chris's problems don't resolve themselves with nature.  In his journal, he expresses his thought well and quotes the works of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Pasternak who help him share his vision of happiness that can't be bought.  Nature can be quite unforgiving, but the wisdom Chris picks up along the way make his uncompromising attempt to live life on his own terms both laudably courageous and a cautionary tale told to the rest of us.    All of the performances are as true to life as the footage.  Including William Hurt who gives us another laudable performance as Chris's driven father, Walt, a successful space engineer.  Emile Hirsch captures all the spirit and naivete' of Chris, and Marcia Gay Harden is perfect as the worried, doting mom.  But the real master is Penn who is able to share Chris's vision.  Meaningful, poetic, colorful, eventful, and magnificent in grandeur, `Into the Wild' is simply a cinematic Odyssey taken by a careful hand who wanted to make both the man and his journey unforgettable.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|As a whole, a delightful movie, well written & acted by Emma Thompson. She impresses me more with every movie. Wonderful, colorful art direction. And the children's scenes were all terrific. But it was Angela Landsbury's turn as the fussy rich Aunt Adelaide that took the cake. I could have done without the suggestive scenes with the loud Mrs. Quickly, but I know it was all done tongue-in-cheek, thus I give it 4 stars. Perhaps not for the whole family, but the whole family will like most of it.
0743486285|5.0|i grew up in the 80s and of course motley crue was huge back then, but i never really knew a whole lot about the band members, and very little about nikki sixx. this book was really cool to see the lifestyle behind the band, and the stories about the things he went through and did are enlightening.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|A flesh & blood person finds he's the main character in a book of an eccentric author, and everything the author is writing is coming true in his life.  It sounds absurd, but it's a smartly written, brilliantly acted dark comedy that is even better the second time you watch it.  There were a couple of moments where the acting was overdone (\\"Taxman!!\\"), but Will Ferrell's low-key role was perfectly pitched, and Emma Thompson's writer-on-the-edge was riveting.  I highly recommend it.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|good as a companion to the book, and good standalone.<br />There are a few songs that get kind of annoying, but Life is Beautiful, Courtesy Call, and Permission are my favorites.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|Heart-wrenching, but life-affirming, this film is yet another triumph for Will Smith.  Is there anything this guy can't do?  And Jaden, his real-life son is a chip off the ole block.  Great story-telling by director Gabriele Muccino as well.  The movie is sometimes tough to watch, because this guy just can't get a break, yet he tries to hold on to his integrity.  Ok, he lied a few times, stiffed a taxi driver, and just couldn't put his pride away to possibly ask for help, but in the end, got the dream job.    Made me appreciate my friends & family more.  For that, I highly recommend this movie.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|This is an excellent film that crosses a few boundaries. It's first and foremost a kung-fu action movie, fused with numerous comedic moments and slapstick, as well as some heartwarming (and heartbreaking) scenes. The Chinese name for this film is simply \\"Kung-Fu\\", but \\"Hustle\\" was added to the English name to set it apart for western audiences. Fans of Stephen Chow will recognize many familiar faces and long-running gags. If you're a fan of kung fu movies (and Chinese cinema in general) and haven't seen this yet, you owe it to yourself to buy this disc.<br /><br />I would say this is Chow's most universally accessible film. But like all foreign movies, some things just don't translate and there will be jokes you won't get. Some of the references and imagery are distinctly Chinese and only funny or understandable to Chinese viewers. The abundant insults and cursing (especially by the landlady) are hilarious if you understand Cantonese.<br /><br />Visually, this film is stunning for its representation of 1940's Shanghai, and the transfer to BD does a very good job. Lots of wonderful and clever fight sequences by famed fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, as well as some great use of CG to exaggerate the action which draws inevitable comparisons to the Matrix (which used a lot CG and also involved Yuen).<br /><br />Features-wise, there's a fair amount of extra stuff in here for a Blu-ray disc, including a 42 minute featurette (all Chinese with subtitles), a 30 minute interview with Chow (all English), bloopers, and deleted scenes. The featurette is for Chinese audiences and looks like something taken from HK television. The interview, on the other hand, is aimed at western audiences who are completely new to Chow's work and HK cinema. It seeks to explain a lot of the influences, gestures, and symbolism in the movie for the benefit of American audiences.<br /><br />Avoid the English audio track at all costs. My player defaulted to English and I had to laugh at the really bad voiceovers before switching back to the original Cantonese. The English dub actors all attempt really bad Chinese accents. It's embarrassing and distracting.<br /><br />The other complaint is that the commentary track is several seconds out of sync with the film in certain places. This is quite distracting when they talk about some very specific things like how they accomplished an effect or point out a small detail in the frame that audiences might miss.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great BD to have in your collection.back to the original Cantonese.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|OK, Matthew was nicely buff. Steve Zahn still has great comic timing. Even Penelope Cruz wasn't too irritating. This Indiana Jones wannabe didn't have quite the intrigue, but is still a fun movie for the adventure-lover in you. Matthew was hopeful this character would become a movie franchise. I think that if they kick the script writing up a notch or two, and they change out the femme fatale, they should try for a sequel.
B000OCZBS0|5.0|First I'd like to start off by saying that I'm actually pretty good friends with these guys (online, that is) and they are extremely wonderful people and are truly sincere. Okay, now for the review (it intertwines a bit of background information, so just bear with me):            When I first came upon the band Diablo Swing Orchestra, I was introduced to the song \\"Balrog Boogie\\" via Sonic Cathedral's \\"Siren's Radio\\". Immediately, the riveting, operatic vocals of DSO' s front woman, Annlouice, caught my attention. I was taken somewhat by surprise when the song finished playing, since the music seemed to be more daring than other femme metal bands out there. I was skeptical though, and ignorantly cast them off as being just another band that was only good for one trick or so and that had an album stuffed with as many raging guitar solos and overused choral effects as Splenda, most likely, has artificial ingredients. I was soon to find out, however, that to prejudge this band was utterly stupid of me.              When curiosity became irritating enough, I finally got myself to listen to the song \\"Heroines\\" posted on DSO's myspace. The song started off with an eerie feel to it...as if someone had taken the infamous theme song to \\"Jaws\\" and seasoned it a bit. Suddenly however, the song burst into what seemed to be a tango-like beat and was followed by the vocals of Annlouice who, during the beginning of the song, had been singing in a mellow tone, almost teasing the listener with the idea that at any moment she could unleash her ultimate vocal power. About a minute or so in, the song began to pick up a bit- and unleash her vocal abilities Annoulice did. The song still seemed to tease a bit though- for the amazing vocalist dotted about every note in between her incredible range and yet still pursued her mellow tones during certain spots in the song. Finally, the song ended with its recognizable tango-esque beat and the beautiful overtone of a strong violin. The song wasmagnificent...and left me addicted.              About a week later, I received the DSO CD...and, now, I was expecting to really enjoy its contents. The first song I listened to was entitled \\"Poetic Pitbull Revolutions\\" which started off with sort of a Mexican atmosphere and the subtle sound of a Spanish horn of some sort, followed by a strong trumpet effect. I was again amazed. The song's middle consisted of Annlouice and Daniel, the other vocalist of the band, exchanging their wonderful vocals that flowed in perfect harmony with one another and gave the listener a nice preview as to what was to come. You could almost hear the deep inhales of Annlouice before she went to resonate another passionate and intense verse in the song. It was truly extraordinary. Between the instruments and bombastic feel of the voices, the song surrounds you in cloud of atmospheric sounds that is not of this world and completely pulls your mind into another place of unique unfamiliarity and serenity all in the same.             The rest of the CD basically follows up to the great potential of the first two songs, and even gives a few slower songs, such as \\"D'angelo\\" to ease the listener a bit before launching them back into the world of stunning, intense, and unearthly music that DSO has seemed to create. I promise you that this CD is nothing like you have ever heard...and to even call it femme metal (as some do) is an offensive statement- for this band has birthed something that definitely exceeds the expectations of any other femme metal band out there. I strongly advise anyone to get this CD, for not only is the music wonderfully complex but it is far beyond just another work that shocks the listener with its beginning passages and then wears down after four or five listens. No, this CD never tires- and that is why DSO has to have one of the greatest album of this year, even excluded of the fact that they have founded something that is guaranteed to have never touched the ears of anymusic fan before. Congratulations to them...they've done a wonderful job.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|A bank heist movie that makes you wonder if they'll get away with it. Good acting all around. Looked like Jodie Foster had a good time playing a character against type. However, the strong expletives had my head spinning. I felt like I needed to take a shower after it was over. Thus, I don't recommend this film.
B00005JPWF|3.0|This film is as earnest as a Mark Trails nature comic book adventure, but in telling the true story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who abandons convention and a promising career to hitchhike and live in the Alaskan wilderness, director Sean Penn, films a beautiful movie void of psychological or spiritual conviction, even while gorgeous landscapes, eagles soaring against the Alaskan sun, oddball eccentric Ameriana road characters pepper in, and a genuine empathy prevails for McCandless' compulsion to walk into the wild woods. There is a nagging doubt that underneath this nature loving idealist, who disappears without a trace to embark on his adventure,  lies a malice aimed at his concerned family who live in grief for years unknowing of his whereabouts and fate.<br /><br />In fact, Penn's inistence to include the McCandless family, (professional, upper-scale, worried sick about their missing son), prominently in the narrative is a superflous reminder of the past when a few well chosen words of dialogue would prevail. We want the great Alaskan wilderness adventure, and while we get that, we also get a whole lot of generation gap family soap which is suspect to significance. Scenes like the cap-throwing college graduation do little but make this a very long movie.<br /><br />We feel for McCandless in much the same way we feel for \\"Grizzly Man',the psycholgically leveraging photographer who also went into the Alaskan  wilderness, believing he could commune with the wild bears, but instead was eaten by them. Likewise McCandless had severe mental issues, that went beyond the call of the wild, in luring him to a wilderness camp where he was inept at hunting and eating wild game, unable to tell a poisonous plant from an edible one, and lived in an abandoned bus begging for a lead paint intolerance. Penn's god-like vistas of the great wilderness are in innoculated contrast to the frail, doomed, self renamed Alexander Supertramp.<br /><br />I expected to love this movie, and while I never even disliked it, (it's a cabin in the woods thing), in retrospect, the haunting image of the real McCandless at the end of the film, leaves him a sad and nearly pathetic man. Is this the intention of the film? To wonder what he was really running away from? When I was 19, I packed a bag and walked and hitchhiked the continental U.S. from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. I too was looking for something but I trust it was not a desire to become a second-rate Thoreau. The film refuses to speculate on where McCandless' intention lied, or where his pain began. It has however conjured in me an absolute respect for him.

B00005JO20|2.0|For the amazing special effects, which is Peter Jackson's forte, I give it an A+. For the long, silent, emotive looks from Naomi Watts, I give it a B-. But for the ridiculous last line of Jack Black (as well as his bad acting), I give it an F. Average that together, and you get a solid C grade. The creepy giant insect scene make your skin crawl for days.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love is a beautiful film in every since of the word.  From the wonderful performances to the beautiful cinematography, In the Mood for Love is an excllent example of crafty filmmaking.<br /><br />The film is about two couples who move in on the same day.  After finding out that their spouses have been cheating on them with each other, they form a great friendship and intimate bond.  But that's just the surface.<br /><br />The two disc criterion release deatures a plethora of materials.  A few deleted scenes, a feature on the music of the movie, which is also haunting and beautiful, an esaay, and many more featurettes on the second disc.  Also included is a booklet with a story that inspired the film.  Plus, there's a short film from the director as well.<br /><br />Must Have.  It's that beautiful.
076780421X|5.0|You fall in love with the leading characters right away. Matthew Perry is at his cutest and Salma Hayek at her prettiest. A story of the consequences of a one-night-stand, but the couple finding out that there is something deeper at work than their attraction to each other. It's funny and sweet. You'll love it.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Blood Diamond is one of the finest films of the year.  Directed by Edward Zwick ([[ASIN:B000JRYOP6 Glory (Special Edition, Repackaged)]], [[ASIN:B0001JXOVC The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]).    Featuring a well acted cast that includes Oscar Nominees Leonardo DiCarprio (Best Actor) and Djimon Hounsou (Best Supporting Actor) and also Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly.    The movie focuses on the conflict \\"blood\\" diamond trade in Africa, and one man trying to get his family back after his home is ravaged.  Leo plays a white African with his own agenda.  Only after a few conditions do they agree to be partners.    This is a great film, whether you get the single disc or the two disc edition.  The single disc only features a commentary and trailers, but the two disc edition features a documentary about the conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone.    Highly, highly recommended.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This movie is about two women who are having relationship problems.  Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a woman living with a man in LA. She has just found out that he is cheating on her and kicked him out.  Iris (Kate Winslet) is in love with her ex, who is getting married to someone else.  Their paths intertwine when they decide to swap houses for the Christmas holiday.  The unexpected romance that they find when they arrive at each other's house brings laughter and tears.  This is a great movie for all of those people out there who love sappy movies.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale is Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, and, ironic, at this point his last to be filmed.  It's the perfect Bond movie.  A wonderful spy thriller, mixed with lots of breathtaking action, hot girls, and the perfect villainry.    This time around, Daniel Craig is James Bond.  He has a few things the other Bonds didn't: he's younger, and he's blond.  He gives one of the best Bond performances in a long time.    It's a great one for sure.  Definitely worth checking out.    Highly recommended.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is the first CD I bought in my life. My mum had brought me to the cinema. The movie we wanted to watch was not on display anymore. So here we were wondering if we would go back home. Then my mum said \\"we've been driving all the way to the cinema, it would be a pity to go back now, let's watch this movie. This movie was \\"The Wall\\".    And it was such a revelation. I was 13 and I didn't understand English at all (actually I'm French). But it was such a blow. So intense, so deep, so powerful. After watching the movie I had only one idea : buying the CD.     A few days later I was entering the CD shop. What a suprise when the seller told me that it was a double CD (and therefore a double price).I still remember the price : 250 francs (about 40 euros). And when you are 13 years old, 250 francs is quite a lot of money.    Anyway I bought the CD. It was 22 years ago. I still have it. I still listen to it. I love it like in the first day.    Pink Floyd is not only music, they definitely have something that goes behind \\"normal\\" music and that manages to touch a very deep thing that lies in us.    Buy the CD and enjoy...
B000001A3H|5.0|Before finding worldwide success with Queens of the Stone Age, Josh Homme was the monstrous lead guitarist of legendary 90's desert rock act Kyuss. Along with \\"Welcome To Sky Valley\\" and \\"...And The Circus Leaves Town\\", this album created an enthralling and influential trilogy. All three albums fused retro bluesy grooves with thundering riffs, trippy sonic jams and the booming rasp of vocalist John Garcia, creating an utterly unique and bold sound. Today many bands imitate this breed of stoner rock, but none can reach the absolute supremacy of Kyuss.<br /><br />\\"Blues For The Red Sun\\" was the first realisation of the band's potential, as their debut \\"Wretch\\" left much to be desired. The song writing was vastly improved, being more ambitious and importantly executed with greater precision and style. Examples of this include the intense \\"Freedom Run\\", a vast slow-burner that envelopes trippy brooding passages, a swaggering lead riff, sublime jamming and Garcia's glorious gritty voice. The two-part piece of \\"Molten Universe/50 Million Year Trip\\" is my favourite moment on the album, and really showcases everything great about the band. The piece is a journey, starting with Homme laying down some monumental riffs, backed up perfectly by Brant Bjork's powerful drumming. Things take a swift and energetic tempo shift and Garcia's vocals come swiping through. The song closes on a wonderfully laid-back groove, with Homme creating some trippy sounds over the top of Garcia's echoing ethereal vocals. This song alone is proof that Kyuss kick some major ass.<br /><br />The album also shows Kyuss' ability to create concise and infectious songs. Opener \\"Thumb\\" kicks things off in sweet and simple style, evolving around a booming main chorus and lead riff. Similarly \\"Green Machine\\" is mostly centred around a simple and addictive chorus theme - hence why it was one of the rare Kyuss songs to obtain some form of commercial success. \\"Thong Song\\" is a tongue-in-cheek comical affair, with unapologetic lyrics concerning long hair, brawn and thongs...it is a simple and fun rocker. These songs act as great contrasts to the extended pieces, giving variation and needed balance to the album.<br /><br />For fans of the desert rock/stoner rock scene, this album and all other Kyuss releases is necessary. It should also very much appeal to fans of 70s rock - Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Hawkwind etc as the band lends heavily from these influences, but gives the styling a fresh outfit. For those interested in getting into Kyuss I would suggest this album or \\"Welcome To Sky Valley\\" as the best starting points. Happy rocking.rics concerning long hair, brawn and thongs...it is a simple and fun rocker.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Hostel is one of those movies that have sparked some huge debates. Some praise it as an instant classic and others deem nothing more than vile trash. Often referred to as torture porn, which is the silliest thing I have ever heard. Hostel is influenced by 70s exploitation movies. Right now Eli Roth is one of the most popular filmmakers. So when anybody gets as popular as Eli Roth has you know the backlash is coming.<br /><br />Roth has been hailed the next great horror filmmaker and even by some the savior of the genre. Eli Roth is only one person; he cannot save or hurt the horror genre on his own. There are many talented filmmakers who go unnoticed or struggle for work. Eli is one of the talented filmmakers who is having a career that is taking off and is possibly the most popular horror filmmaker out there right now. And due to that it's made him a sitting duck to be ripped a part.<br /><br />I respect everybody's opinion and I'm sure some people just don't like the work of Eli Roth and that's fine. The most loved of filmmakers will have people who dislike their work and the most hated of filmmakers will have people that like their work. But I do feel Eli Roth sometimes gets a little too much heat from fans and critics.<br /><br />When it comes to a movie like Hostel it's not gonna be for every horror fan, but what I loved about Hostel is Roth, is going back to the old school style of filmmaking and is one of the guys bringing back the long forgotten Grindhouse type flicks. People seem to forget there were movies like Hostel over the years, these types of movies started in the 60s, but the 70s is where these flicks will be remembered. The difference is, they weren't mainstream. They were popular at the Drive-Ins, but Hostel gained mass appeal. And it's been so long in some ways movies like Hostel are new since these movies haven't been done in so long and a lot of the core auidnce probably never saw the flicks that inspired Hostel.<br /><br />Over the last couple of years we have been stuck with lame PG-13 horror flicks and PC horror flicks. Eli Roth is a filmmaker that does his thing and doesn't let PC police sway him from getting his vision out. Right now in America the Liberal way of thinking is taking over. Sex and nudity is now a bad thing. Without sex none of us would even be here. Hostel has a lot of nudity and some sex scenes. Well since the 70s a lot of horror films have. Eli isn't the first person to use that in a horror film. Everything in this country has gotten so damn PC and sexually repressed.<br /><br />The lead characters is Hostel are young, single and on vacation am I supposed to believe that there is nobody out there like these characters? I don't get the big deal with the sex and nudity all of that is a common part of life and again plenty of horror filmmakers and filmmakers of any genre for that matter have used this in their movie, but now suddenly it's a bad thing.<br /><br />What I find rather funny is how many people bash the people who enjoyed Hostel as being sick and disturbed. I find that funny because many of these people also watch horror movies. What's the difference between what happens in Hostel and your run of the mill slasher movie? It's wrong to watch someone get tortured and killed, but ok to watch a slasher flick where people are hacked up? What's the difference? Murder is murder isn't it? Granted a movie like Hostel might be more extreme, but again murder is murder.<br /><br />The screenplay by Eli Roth is very solid; his characters aren't faceless and as thin as the paper they were written on. The characters come across as real people. I've known people who are a lot like the lead characters in Hostel. For me, one of the most important things in a horror flick is how I relate to the characters or if I can see myself being friends with them if this were real life. Eli Roth again created real characters. I'm not really like any of the characters in Hostel, but they weren't bad people.They were having their last moments of freedom before the real word kicks in when they head back home.<br /><br />The first on screen torture scene in Hostel doesn't come until the 40-minutue mark. Prior to that there are 2 deaths. One being off screen and the other as it begins there is a cut and we don't actually see anything, which makes the one we finally see a lot stronger. Unlike the slasher film, Eli Roth actually spends the first half of the movie developing the characters. In other horror movies the makers drop building up the characters and get right into the action and faceless characters.<br /><br />A lot of the people who bash Hostel are so off base; Roth could have taken the easy way out and jumped right into the action and made a movie with nothing, but gore and violence through out. But again the guy takes the time and develops the characters. And when the action starts we have come to know the characters and feel for them. Hostel isn't violence just for the sake of it. Never once does Eli Roth glorify the torture and murder scenes. I have seen plenty of movies where the filmmakers do that.<br /><br />As a director Eli Roth is showing a lot of promise. I don't wanna start a Cabin Fever/Hostel debate, but he really grew as a filmmaker in-between films. That's not to say Cabin Fever was bad. It was an enjoyable flick, but you can see how Roth grew as a filmmaker. The first half of Hostel was well done with the set up and the 2nd half has some great suspenseful and tension filled moments. The scene when Paxton is about to be tortured was classic.<br /><br />The whole 2nd half of Hostel was excellent; the comedy is toned down, which is a good thing. When it comes time to build suspense I hate when filmmakers have to throw in comedic moments. Often it's a tension breaker, but Roth pulls no punches and goes straight for the tension. While there is a scene or two with comedy the way it's done really adds to the movie. When you break it down there is a lot more to Hostel than people realize. The characters are well developed and there is some solid suspense in the 2nd half.<br /><br />People say Hostel isn't scary so it sucks. Unlike other type of horror films, movies like Hostel don't rely in the traditional way of scaring people. Picture yourself in another country, your friends disappear you are a stranger here, you can't' trust anyone. Or if anything picture yourself in another state. The scares aren't the typical boogeyman hiding in the shadows scare. The chance of something like Hostel actually happening is a good chance compared to the never ending run of slasher movies, which are pure fantasy.<br /><br />The acting was also quite solid; normally these types of movies feature weak acting, but Hostel had a solid cast and Jay Hernandez does a fantastic job at carrying the movie. His performance was real, he wasn't an actor he was the character of Paxton. The rest of the cast is solid, but Jay was the stand-out. Rick Hoffman though nearly steals the show in his brief scene.<br /><br />In closing, Hostel is a solid movie that is getting way too much heat. It's only a movie people. Eli Roth showed some great promise here and Hostel is one of the finest horror movies of the decade. I'll admit upon my first viewing I didn't quite like Hostel, but going back and watching it I realized how much more there was to Hostel than I first thought.e real word kicks in when they head back home.

B000VNMMRA|4.0|For a long time fan of DIE HARD, I was pumped for this movie more than any movie that came out last summer, and I'll be watching this movie over and over and over again.<br /><br />Thankfully, with LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, we don't get a group of terrorists peeling out of doors and walking in formation, or anything ripped from the previous films. The best thing though, is that it creates its own little twist on the 'wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time' theme, instead of copying the original like DIE HARD 2 did.<br /><br />Ultimately, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is a typical summer blockbuster. In a majority of ways it's a cut above the rest, and in other ways, it's as ridiculous and unrealistic as a Devlin, Emmerich or Bay movie.<br /><br />The best thing about the Die Hard movies is that in keeping with the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation, they've always kept the action scenes SOMEWHAT realistic. I mean, sure, McClaine has done some pretty crazy stunts, but they were always done realistically. Even the leap from the top of the building in the original was pheasible. If he hadn't jumped he would have died. In the third, the subway explosion was a little over the top, and more so, the explosion on the barge. I mean, they've always portrayed McClaine as overly brave, but ultimately vulnerable and most importantly realistic...<br /><br />...until the F35 scene.<br /><br />For that 10 minutes... I thought I was watching a lousy Michael Bay movie as the plane lowers itself perfectly, despite the overpass crumbling all around him and no fighter pilot would fly there in their right mind, except this one, just in the perfect location for McClaine to fall from the truck onto the wing and then miraculously cling to the wing as the plane hovers and dips, as if he had spider skills. (Maybe they knew that Spiderman 3 was their competition)<br /><br />I could go on and on about the ridiculousness of that unnecessary scene. Gotta please the popcorn poppers out there I guess. I mean... he's firing into OVERPASSES at a truck!! First of all... WHY? Second of all... HE'S MISSING!!!<br /><br />With the exception of that scene, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD was outstanding. Thankfully, LIVE FREE has something that most action movies forget about. You can blow up everything in the world and have the coolest over the top action scenes on the planet, but until you have a sympathetic character that the audience can relate to and get behind... you have nothing.<br /><br />With DIE HARD you have it all.ES at a truck!!

B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum was a bitter sweet ending to a wonderful series of movies. In the world of cinema where computer effects and super humans at every turn, Jason Bourne reminds us that when you as an audience can connect with a character at an emotional level, it's the story that makes the movie. With all the action I felt, the movie glided along just fine. Ultimatum was a wonderful film but I felt it was the weakest of the series. But I find myself becoming critical in the way that Harry Potter fans are of their final installment, the ending wasn't up to par of what I desired. None the less Matt Damon has proven himself to be on par with the greatest action hero's of our time; grossing more than Cruise's Mission Impossible series, also being able to outright restructure the Bond films. Robert Ludlum created a character that was meant to change, not only Bourne's own life, but the way audiences look at the \\"action hero\\". Go remind yourself of why you watch movies; Bourne will help bring back your memory of that first time you got introduced into this genre.    Update: I want to thank everyone who has found this helpful. I loved this movie and I hope others can enjoy it as much as I did.
B000UJCALI|4.0|Part of me loves \\"The Shining\\" while other parts in the film only liking it until it does something that makes me love it again. Which is kind of strange to say since the film is often put on the top 10 scariest movies ever, along with William Friedkin's \\"The Exorcist\\" and Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\". Known for being a great visual artist, The Shining has many of the horror genre's most memorable images yet at times it's the film itself that doesn't seem to excel. As Steven Spielberg says in a documentary, Kubrick films tend to be growers with you watching it several times before you like it and the Shining was the same way for me.    Jack Torrance is a former schoolteacher/writer who wants to get away and start a new project. The Overlook Hotel is perfect since it's very isolated and thanks to the hotel closing during winter, it's the ideal place for him to get away from it all. With wife Wendy and son Danny in tow, the family settle into the massive hotel and attempt to adjust. But the hotel has a history that's quite sensitive to Jack as well as Danny's unique gift which let him see the horrors of what lies inside the Overlook Hotel.    Despite being known as a more clinical filmmaker (the Shining author Stephen King said once he thinks too much and feels too little), Kubrick can still supply memorable images that never seem to leave your mind and almost get taken into pop culture and become oft-used parodies. And the Shining has several with the twins in the hallway, blood in an elevator, room 237 and probably the weirdest scene involving a bear costume I've ever seen, the film does have a lot of memorable imagery.     Problem is the film they're attached to is slightly flawed. Famously known for doing multiple takes (as many as 70 and up), the film at times as scenes that run for too long and it brings down the tension a bit. The scares that encompass the film have their own tension and build but it's the film as a whole that almost seems to lack one, with some scares just popping in out of nowhere and then we're off to the next scene feeling like we got a reset button. Some would disagree but for me, the film as a couple of issues that drag it down a tad.    Jack Nicholson has always been regarded as one of cinema's more famous and highly regarded actors although sometimes when he plays more manic or animated characters personality-wise, he's slightly over the top. Of course in some cases it works (\\"heeere's Johnny!\\") but other times, like a scene where he's shot from below has that feeling he's going a bit too caricature-like. Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are also good and despite having the most irritating thing to do in a scene with his repeated \\"redrum\\"'s, Lloyd is quite the find.    When I first saw the Shining on the 2001 DVD, I thought it's a film where I admire it for its imagery and the way it was shot but I didn't love it whole-heartedly. After 2 more viewings with this DVD, including the commentary (complete with pretentious-sounding biographer), I still think it's a very watchable but slightly flawed film.
B00005JPAO|4.0|This movie puts us in Queen Elizabeth's shoes. It shows us the burdens of royal office from her point of view. So it provides an unusual perspective - an alternative to simply gawking at royalty from outside their gates.     Helen Mirren brings wonderful gravitas to her role, mixing it with the homely English capacity to push through. She's someone who reigns on the one hand, and who serves her family picnic salad and investigates how to jack her car out of the mud on the other hand. (I didn't even know that the Monarch drives her own car a lot of the time.)    There are several commentaries on the DVD. I found the director/writer commentary a little dry, with a sort of unpleasant testiness in the exchange between the two. Robert Lacey's commentary is a bit livelier, so if you only have time to listen to one commentary, I suggest you make it Lacey's account of the history behind some of the royal protocol.    Then if you would like to consider the role of monarchy a little further, I suggest you check out the \\"The Swan,\\" a film starring Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly. This is perhaps Grace Kelly's most overlooked film, but possibly her best. The movie is based on Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnar's famous work. It features a brilliant closing speech by Guinness, arguing that a Queen's duty is to glide alone and serene away from all popular pastime and indulgence.    Since Princess Di came on the scene, everyone automatically cast her as - the rose - the swan. However, this Helen Mirren movie makes a good case that Elizabeth II, purse and pumps and all, has nevertheless these last 50 years, kept faith as the swan.

B000V6BE6C|2.0|It wouldn't come as a surprise to hear John McCain using \\"Critical Acclaim\\" as his campaign song during next year's presidential election - hearing M. Shadows snarl republican remarks like \\"they never contributed a thing to the country they love to criticize\\" is enough to make even the most uptight conservative grin. While Avenged's right-wing sensibilities may all but guarantee they won't be invited for an opening slot on Green Day's next tour, the suggestible kids who bought \\"City of Evil\\" will likely eat it up. It's this blunt, straightforward lyricism, coupled with a healthy dose of vulgarity (the phrase \\"motherf***er\\" seems to be the very cornerstone of Shadows' vocabulary) that reminds listeners that eloquence was never A7X's biggest selling point.     However, to their credit, the band has taken their greatest strength (namely recycling Guns N' Roses licks and serving them to an audience too young to actually remember Guns N' Roses), and refined and polished it to the nth degree. The 10 songs on \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" are substantially shorter than those of \\"City of Evil,\\" and this time the former metalcore poster boys stick strictly to the rock - unlike their previous album, there are no excursions into Danny Elfman or Segovia territory here.     But make no mistake - \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" is the band's most accessible record to date. The songs are coated with an inch-thick layer of studio gloss and  an almost pop structure provides the groundwork for the majority of the album. Additionally, many of the songs are ornamented with decorations of arguable necessity (refer to the painfully cliched organ interlude of \\"Critical Acclaim\\" and the tribal percussion of \\"Brompton Cocktail\\" for just a few of many examples throughout the album).     While the band have never been taken seriously before, they're not imploring listeners to start doing so now either. Upon hearing their latest offering, it can be reasonably inferred that Avenged Sevenfold's main objectives are a)to ride the waves of their mainstream popularity for as long as possible and b) to make sure you vote Republican next year.

B000NA28I4|2.0|Eragon is based on the novel by the same name by author Christopher Paolini. The film is about a young teen farmer who lives in a land controlled by an evil king named Galbatorix (John Malkovich). The story goes that there was a time when men and dragons fought together and Galbatorix betrayed his people and killed all the dragons and most of their riders. Now an unborn dragon named Saphira falls into the hands of young Eragon. The two are destined for each other to take out Galbatorix. So this is not one of my more skilled synopses but this movie is not really hard to sum up.<br /><br />Ok I didn't hear of Eragon until I saw the preview for this film. I never heard of the book or anything. I have no idea why I pay any attention to trailers cause most of the time they seriously make the good films look bad and the bad films look good. Eragon looked like a decent film and I expected a lot of it. This is one weird movie because it had everything it needed to be great. It had the what I'm told a great book to go by so the story was a piece of cake. It had the money so the cinematography was no problem and the CGI looked incredibly realistic. And it also had actors, so where could this movie mess up? Well for one the script to me had no heart, no feeling. You can tell when it's the actors or the writing and I'm sure it was the writing. I mean Jeremy Irons is no amateur at these types of films. Rachel Weisz was a nice fit playing the voice of Saphira and did a great job. She was the only one that had a couple of good scenes where you could feel her and she was a computer-generated dragon.<br /><br />The battles were awful and the sound quality of the battle made it worst. I've heard more sword clashing on an episode of Rachel Ray's cooking show. Some say the film was slow but to me it went too fast and just organized badly altogether. There was no suspense building up to the final battle either. If anything good came out of Eragon it was the cinematography and the base of the story itself was interesting. If there is a sequel which I'm sure there will be because this movie did well at the box office I would be tempted to see it hoping someone reads all the bad reviews and fixes the mistakes. To be honest this story has a lot to work with and the next film can be saved. I'd say save Eragon for your child or young niece or nephew who will just be fascinated by the dragon but leave some room for hope that the second will be better.self was interesting.

B000U7169M|2.0|Well you can tell by my blatant sarcasm that this movie was far from scary. If anything it had one really creepy part and the rest was like a supernatural episode of Law & Order or something. Most of the horror lovers will probably love my opening sentence and quickly get rid of this and that's why I wrote that first. The film is about a woman named Katherine (Hilary Swank) who has had a pretty tough life so far. She lost her child and husband during a expedition. Katherine investigates what seem to be supernatural acts and gives them a scientific explanation. Because of what happened to her family she has lost all faith. She is now a professor at LSU with her partner Ben played by Idris Elba. Her and Ben are called upon to help explain a crazy and shocking discovery.<br /><br />In a small town called Haven the river has turned completely red like blood, which is the first plague. After more and more start to happen like frogs falling from the trees into the river she encounters a young girl. The girl runs and then she is told that the town thinks the girl killed her brother and is the reason for the plagues. Because of this the town believes they have to kill the girl to stop the plagues. Katherine undergoes a huge battle trying to decide if the girl is truly evil or the exact opposite. There is some good to this movie, the acting is really good and it has great picture and sound quality. Also it's a interesting story and it kept me interested to the end.<br /><br />What messes up The Reaping is the fact that it is not even a thriller. It does not scare you at all and it takes forever to get to a point that you know is coming. There were a few scenes where they were building you up for something scary and then it stops. Nothing happens, just on to the next bit of information. It really was like a prolonged TV mystery that couldn't be too scary. What scared me most was that I almost bought this movie instead of borrowing it. I only hope my friend can trade this in or something. Overall the movie was ok but if your looking for something scary which this is obviously supposed to be don't even waste your time.verall the movie was ok but if your looking for something scary which this is obviously supposed to be don't even waste your time.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|Brand new restored version of Godards classic new wave picture. Criterion gives us everything but a commentary track but the booklet more than makes up for it. Great packaging from cover art to insert case to the way down to the look of the discs.     The restored print looks really compared to the old disc I sort of tossed away and will forget about. This is a release done right and I'm sure a long time coming. We can hope for more classics like this from Criterion soon.

B0001AP12G|2.0|I'm ashamed to admit that I actually bought this when it came out because at that time everything was all \\"Kanye West\\" this and \\"Kanye West\\" that. Well, at least I'll never fall for that again. \\"Through The Wire\\" is one of the most puke-worthy songs I've ever heard. For KW to even think that it was a good idea to speed up the chorus of \\"Through The Fire\\" by the great Chaka Khan so that it sounds like the chipmunks, and let it repeat throughout the entire song, the record label should have dropped him for that alone. Pretty much every other song is as equally pathetic. \\"All Falls Down\\" is remotely listenable, but only because of the strong vocal contributions of Syleena Johnson. If she weren't present here, that song would suck as much as all the others. This truly was the beginning of the end for hip-hop having any credibility whatsoever.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Dexter is a great series, just as most of the other reviewers have said.  Michael C. Hall is superb, but the writing is not as good as it could be.  I know it's not the acting, as there are several Oz alumni in this series, and I know the excellent acting they are capable of.  The show's big flaw is when it becomes just a flat, generic cop story and the dialogue becomes wooden and cliched.  Fortunately, we have Hall and the character of Dexter to raise this to must-see level.
B000TGJ8IU|3.0|When I saw the original version of Troy, I don't remember thinking that the movie needed more \\"character development\\" or longer battle scenes. It was pretty good as it was, even though it occasionally lapsed into Hollywood epic dialogue and some of its scenes were flat out absurd, e.g., the scene where Hector kills Patroclus, thinking he's actually Achilles, then turns to Odysseus and calls off a battle involving tens of thousands of men. \\"That's enough for today,\\" he says, and then they all retreat. Right. If the director wanted to release a new version of the movie, he should have fixed up scenes like this rather than just undo all the edits that made the original so tight in the first place.    The director's cut of Troy isn't all that bad, but it's worse than the original. Director's cuts are always worse and always longer, because what they do is restore all the \\"missing scenes\\" that were cut (usually for good reasons) from the original. For example, in this \\"new and improved\\" version of Troy, the battles are longer and a lot bloodier, which isn't necessarily bad in itself, but I thought the original battle scenes were more effective, mostly due to the tighter editing. In the new version, we also get a lot more character dialog, but \\"more dialog\\" isn't the same thing as more \\"character development.\\" None of this restored footage told me anything new about the characters or helped to clarify their relationships or any of that stuff. It was all pretty clear in the original.     The director's cut seemed \\"off\\" somehow. It wasn't as tight, for one thing, but there was something weird about the sound quality and the new score was god-awful, in my opinion. I've read that the picture quality is much better; if so, I didn't really notice.  In any case, I have yet to see a director's cut that was better than the original and this new version of Troy is no exception. I'm starting to think that this business of restoring missing scenes is just a marketing gimmick for selling movies twice.     Ancient World Review
055358202X|3.0|This installment of A Song of Fire and Ice is okay..it is somewhat of a letdown.    What I liked:  The plot did advance with Arya, Brienne, and Sersei.  There were cliffhangers for all of them.  It makes me look forward to the next isnstallment.  There is the intriguing addition of Arian Martel.  How will the Lannisters react to what had happened with Princess Myrcella?  Another cliffhanger.  There also was an addenda by the author hinting that some characters believed to be dead...The belief may be premature.  The development of Sansa Stark is welcome.  She is growing a backbone along with her armour of courtesy.    What I didn't like and missed:  Jon Snow, Danyreus, Tyrion,  I am awaiting their return.  Bran and Davos(I think of him as Everyman for this epic)were missed as well.  Bran Stark provided the mysticism.  What role will he play?  This wasn't answered.  The biggest shortcoming was adding Queen Sersei's POV.  She came across as even more cartoonish and monstrous than in the previous three books.  She seems even LESS like her twin Jaime.  She is becoming more debauched, dumb and cruel while loving every minute of it.  Her love and protectiveness of her son Tommen is her redeeming characteristic.  Like many rulers, fantasy and real, she makes every decision for the short term with disastrous consequences(think, letting the Septons revive their army).  Brienne seemed to move in interesting but nonproductive circles, no nearer in her quest to recovering Catelyn Stark's daughters.  However, this is more realism, haven't we all experienced this in striving for a goal?    This book is what I would consider a bridge to the finale (think [[ASIN:078878983X The Two Towers (The Lord of the Rings, Book 2)]]).

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|\\"Once\\" is a real find. The story of a street musician who meets a Czech &eacute;migr&eacute; on the streets of downtown Dublin, is a believable, well-made film about love, dreams and making things happen.<br /><br />Guy (Glen Hansard, a real musician who also appeared in the film \\"The Commitments\\"), a street busker who sings his heart out on the streets of Dublin, works in his dad's vacuum repair shop. One day, a young lady (Marketa Irglova), a Czech immigrant, begins to ask him questions about his music, his passions, the inspiration for his ballads. They form a friendship and she encourages him to follow his dream and put together a demo album. As the friendship grows, she helps him negotiate a recording studio and practice the songs. In the process, she invites him into her home, to meet her mother and young daughter. During the course of their relationship, they grow closer, but she is still married and can't let anything happen. They round up some other musicians and begin to work on the demo, to help him with his dream.<br /><br />\\"Once\\", written and directed by John Carney, is a very intimate look at the relationship between these two people. A lot of handheld camera work, close shots and grungy, real locations help to give the film an incredible cinema verite look and style. The camera work is handheld, but not overly shaky, creating shots with an intimate, close appearance, really thrusting us into the middle of the action.<br /><br />The relationship between Guy and Girl (as they are listed in the credits) is really an interesting one that draws you into their lives. Initially, the guy is a bit put off by the girl, she is extremely chatty and forthcoming, asking him a lot of questions about his music, why he sings certain songs, the inspiration, etc. As a street musician, he is naturally a little weary about people getting too close, he simply wants them to enjoy a little of the music and drop a couple of coins or bills into his guitar case and leave. So, the young woman who stops to ask questions, in her accented English, is a minor annoyance, until he realizes she is genuinely interested.<br /><br />As their relationship grows, he feels a fondness for her, and as a single man, he naturally flirts with her. But when she realizes this is going too far, she gives him a little look, a minor reprimand, and he realizes she is right. They are friends, sharing an experience. And she is married, even if her husband still lives in the Czech Republic and they are having problems.<br /><br />As they become friends, they become involved in each other's lives. He meets her mother and daughter, sees where she lives, has dinner at their house. She meets his dad and becomes involved in his making of a demo album.<br /><br />When the duo shows up at the recording studio, with their fellow street musicians, the sound engineer greets them, but secretly reveals his true feelings to someone on his cell phone. He has a feeling this group is another example of people with too much ambition and not enough talent; they don't even know the technical details of recording the music. But when they start playing, he recognizes they have talent, the songs are good, and the lead singer, our guy, is quite good, so he becomes engrossed in making the demo as good as possible. He becomes a part of their team, investing part of himself in the production of the demo.<br /><br />Part of the beauty of \\"Once\\" is that nothing seems forced. They don't have sex, simply to make the story more dramatic. In fact, the course of their relationship seems all the more real because they simply remain friends, close friends invested in each other's lives and livelihood. There aren't any manufactured crises involving her mother and baby or his dad. They simply struggle with real life.<br /><br />Also, the music is quite good throughout the film. Guy sings a song, a love ballad he wrote for his girlfriend who moved away to London, a few times, each time making it a little better. Finally, when they record it for the demo, it is as good as it could be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.<br /><br />\\"Once\\" is a film about the guy following his dream. He wants to make a demo and travel to London, to try to get a contract. But perhaps more importantly, he wants to reunite with his girlfriend. All he needs is a little push, a little support and guidance from a friend. He finds that friendship with the girl, his new friend who helps him realize he should go for his dream.ould be, with the girl playing keyboard and singing backup and the addition of the other musicians they have recruited.    \\"Once\\" is a film about the guy following his dream.

B000WSJNWQ|4.0|Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) finishes a business conference in Johannesburg. As he gets in the cab for the airport, he realizes he missed a call on his cell phone from a private number. He calls his pregnant wife, Isabella (Reese Witherspoon), back in Chicago, who is playing a game of soccer with their son. Anwar's flight lands in Washington, DC, where he is scheduled to change planes, before arriving back home in Chicago. In Washington, DC, CIA Director Corinne Whitman (Meryl Streep) orders her people to grab Anwar as he changes planes; they suspect he may have ties to a terrorist who bombed a crowded square in a northern African country. After a few moments of interrogation, Anwar is shipped to the North African country where he is interrogated and tortured by the chief of police, Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) on behalf of the CIA. A new CIA administrator, Douglas Freeman (Jake Gylenhaal) finds himself thrust into the role of interrogator when the interrogator is killed in the square bombing. There isn't time to find a replacement, so Douglas has to take over. When Isabella realizes her husband has vanished, she turns to an old school friend, Alan Smith (Peter Saarsgard) who works in the office of Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin) to see if he can help.<br /><br />\\"Rendition\\", written by Kelly Sane and directed by Gavin Hood (Academy Award Winner \\"Tsotsi\\"), wants to expose and dramatize a practice our country seems to be involved in, a practice we are learning more and more about. The film does cast a light on this murky area of our political engine, but it doesn't fully engage the audience in the characters and is weakened because of this. I don't think \\"Rendition\\" is powerful enough to get people to act.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is one of our greatest actresses and I would pay to watch her read the phone book. When I was describing this film to a co-worker, I brought up \\"Out of Africa\\" and the co-worker started to criticize Streep's performance as Issak Dinesen. I almost got into a fistfight when she made a comment about Streep's `fake accent'. Streep always makes any film she appears in better - good or bad, films benefit from the actresses ability to make a character come alive and her oft-noted ability to portray accents. Naturally, every performance is different and some work better than others. But they are all, at the very least, good. In \\"Rendition\\", she plays Whitman, the steely director of the CIA. She receives a call in the middle of the night; a bombing in a busy square in a North African country has killed one of their special interrogators. At the same time, they are tracking Anwar on his flight from South Africa. She instantly orders the suspect to be captured when he switches planes at Dulles. She wants him interrogated. When they can reach no conclusive answers and she is running out of time to hold him, she has him shipped back to the same North African country for interrogation. She is convinced she knows something.<br /><br />The scariest thing about Streep's character is her conviction she knows what she is doing is right. She never doubts it. For a minute. So when she is confronted by the man's wife, Isabella (Witherspoon), she calmly and coolly tells the young mother that she is sorry for the woman's trouble, but she knows nothing. She manages to almost convince us and we know differently.<br /><br />Her character also has more than a little depth. When the phone call wakes her up in the middle of the night, she calms her husband (Bob Gunton) much like a parent would a child. He dutifully appears at her side at a black tie event. These moments help to show Corrine has a personal life, making her more than simply a \\"villain\\".<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon is good as Isabella. Naturally distraught, she tries to find out the truth about her husband, while caring for their young son and their unborn child. She turns to a friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works in a Senator's office for help after she learns that herhusband got on the flight in South Africa but somehow never got off the flight at Dulles Airport. She finds credit card charges he made on the plane and then turns to the Senator's aide for help. As doors are continuously slammed in her face, she becomes more and more worried and more and more desperate.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Douglas Freeman, a new recruit for the CIA. Hired on as an Administrator, he quickly adjusts to life in the North African country, his new post. But the death of the agent who will be their new interrogator affects him and he is even more shocked to learn he will be taking the deceased man's place. When Nawal takes over the interrogation of Anwar, Douglas must watch the excessive techniques, challenging his convictions. He soon forms an opinion of the man's guilt or innocence and decides to act. This role is interesting, but I'm not sure it achieves the intended result. I feel we are supposed to see the futility of the actions through Douglas' eyes - He certainly doesn't like what they are doing, but he takes a long time to act, making the character a bit unsuccessful.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal has a few nice moments with the character. When his colleague dies, it clearly affects him. He is covered with the man's blood and has to take care of some business before he can even remove the shirt. After he does, we see his hands shake a bit as he goes through shock.<br /><br />Peter Saarsgard is good as Alan Smith, the Senator's aide, but his character gives up too easy. He is very determined to help Isabella, and even has the Senator's (Alan Arkin) ear for a while, but when Whitman gets to the Senator, everything changes and Peter is warned to stay away. If he believes in Anwar's innocence, why doesn't he fight more? If he doesn't believe in Anwar's case, why does he fight at all? Due to his past relationship with Isabella?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Rendition\\" deals with the narrative. As we flip back and forth between the various characters, we also follow the story of Nawal's headstrong teenaged daughter, Fatima. Nawal doesn't want her to see a new boyfriend, Khalid, so she runs away, to live with him. As Nawal continues to search for her, we see the interrogation of Anwar and also the story of Fatima and Khalid's growing love. As they become more involved, Khalid takes her to a student demonstration and introduces her to some of his friends, friends who would rather remain anonymous. Nawal continues to try to find her, but has little luck. This story dovetails into the rest of the narrative, with the help of a sloppy device, and doesn't seem to do anything other than detract from the rest of the story.<br /><br />We are supposed to see a parallel between Fatima and Khalid and the interrogation of Anwar, but beyond the obvious, there really isn't any.<br /><br />Because of the large handful of characters we follow through the course of the film, each is equivalent to a supporting character. Supporting characters have less time on screen, less time to make us believe in their character and less time to make us really care for their character. Because we don't feel a strong bond or connection to Isabella or Anwar, his torture doesn't have the impact on us it should.<br /><br />\\"Rendition\\" is good, but it isn't the film that will move us to take action.a but somehow never got off the flight at Dulles Airport.

0679746323|1.0|I always knew Mao was an SOB but the person described in this book just stumbled into history and didn't have any real abilities.  He was evil and the people around him weak. There was no objective analysis and every issue was presented one sided - Mao liked nobody - not even his family.  I find it hard to believe he rose to the position he did based on my only reading of this book.  I did not enjoy this book - not entertaining - not analytical - just a laundry list of evil acts with interpretations that had no backing.
B000XA5K48|3.0|\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is like watching a live action graphic novel. A fun movie, it is very violent and filled with some memorable lines. Nice turns by Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti almost make the completely excruciating performance by Monica Bellucci forgivable. The film doesn't have the visual style of other graphic novel adaptations, but it is fun nonetheless.<br /><br />A tall, unshaven man wearing a black leather overcoat (Clive Owen) sits on a bus bench eating a carrot. He watches a pregnant woman run by, clutching her stomach. Then, a car filled with gun toting men barrels around the corner. \\"Mr. Smith\\" realizes the woman is in trouble and hurries to her aid. He rushes the woman into an abandoned warehouse and tries to comfort the new mother as she gives birth. Complicating matters are the numerous men with guns who don't care about the impending birth and want to kill the woman. Mr. Smith has to aid the new mother as he tries to protect her. Hertz (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the bad guys, is a little puzzled; he doesn't know who Smith is, or why he gets involved. The woman dies shortly after giving birth and Smith realizes he now has to care for the baby. But Hertz and his men are in pursuit, so Smith looks for help. He turns to a hooker named Donna (Monica Bellucci) who has recently given birth. Smith has to protect the baby and Donna and figure out why Hertz is so intent on getting the child.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier that watching \\"Shoot\\" is like watching a live-action graphic novel. This is a growing trend, basing films on graphic novels, allowing filmmakers to delve into unusual, strange stories, stories that would never see the light of day in a more conventional filmmaker's universe. This growing subgenre of film has brought us a number of highly visual, very interesting films. Films like \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\" shot the characters against green screen, adding backgrounds later, giving the films an even greater graphic novel style. And these films are pretty magnificent. Graphic novels have also greatly influenced other films. \\"Batman Begins\\" was based on the work of Frank Miller, who also created \\"Sin City\\" and \\"300\\", giving the superhero a darker edge and making him more interesting. \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" has some of these similar elements, but the environment is not nearly as interesting. The film is set in a run down metropolis, a common setting for this type of story, but it looks like a set someone went through and added some elements to, to amp up the `weird' factor. The visual style is no where near as interesting or complete as \\"Sin City\\".<br /><br />Interestingly, Clive Owen appears in both playing a similar character. In \\"Shoot `Em Up\\", `Smith\\" is not as well defined as Dwight, his character in \\"Sin City\\", or as interesting, but he is fun to watch. Taking on elements of Clint Eastwood's famous cowboy persona, The Man with No Name, Owen's character simply becomes known as \\"Smith\\". Throughout, we learn little bits about him and Kurtz even gives us a few facts he either learned or gleamed from his dealings with the reluctant hero.<br /><br />From the first moment we see him, sitting on a bus stop bench, at night, in the middle of a run down metropolis; we know Smith is probably not going to win any citizenship awards. I instantly got the feeling he was living off the grid, supported by a visit to his home later in the film. Smith lives in an abandoned warehouse complete with his own indoor garden, filled with carrots ripe for the plucking, and eating. \\"Good for the eyesight\\" he states, when Donna looks at him strangely.<br /><br />Smith is also a reluctant hero. He watches the pregnant woman run down the street and then the car full of gun toting men. He sighs, gets up and gets involved. After she dies, he initially wants to leave the baby, but decides he can't. This reluctance adds some interest to his character. As he becomes further entwined in the story, his curiosity takes over. As Kurtz becomes more persistent, this serves to make Smith more hell bent on revenge. These moments help to make Smith a more interesting character; even though he inhabits a cartoon universe, he seems to have some real feelings and emotions.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch Paul Giamatti play a villain. It is a nice change for this actor who gained a lot of critical praise for his work in \\"Sideways\\". Kurtz is not your normal villain; he is evil and hell bent on achieving his goal, but he also appears to be a more typical man. Yes, he has a gun in his hand, but without this deadly weapon, he could just as easily be mistaken for a librarian, creating one of the more interesting villains to come along in some time.<br /><br />Kurtz also has some moments of levity; his wife constantly calls on his cell phone, apparently unaware of her husband's true occupation. At moments, he wonders out loud how Smith could be giving them so much trouble. These elements help to make Giamatti's Kurtz seem vulnerable, less scary, yet when he speaks, gritting his teeth, we understand how deadly he can be. This is a villain who is equally at home spraying bullets across a room as he is trying to problem solving, and figuring things out.<br /><br />When the film was over, my companion commented that if you took all of the dialogue in the film it would probably only fill ten pages. She is completely true. Unfortunately Monica Bellucci still has a considerable amount of dialogue in the film. Bellucci has an extremely heavy accent, making most of what she says difficult to understand. That, and the fact that she isn't a good actress, makes it difficult to watch her on any level. Sure, she's very pretty, but there are many very pretty actresses in Hollywood who can at least act a little and would have done a better job in this role. Throughout the film, she frequently says \\"Smith\\" and even this simple line seems to perplex her.<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" certainly delivers on the action. From the initial confrontation in the abandoned warehouse, where Smith quickly secures a gun, he is never without a pistol for long. And when he doesn't have a sidearm, he finds other items to help him ward off the villains. Smith gets into many tough scrapes and finds some ingenious ways to get out of the situation. With each confrontation,  the stakes are raised along with the danger; and the elaborate stunts Smith pulls to get out of these scrapes escalates until you think it can't possibly go any further. But it does. You keep expecting the next confrontation to be a little more normal, but they just keep getting more outlandish. Watching the action in \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is a little like riding a roller coaster, with bullets flying overhead.<br /><br />But I can't really describe any of this, because it would spoil the fun of watching it yourself.<br /><br />As good as the action is, it is also over the top and cartoony. I suspect it is intended as a parody of action violence; Smith's constant chewing on carrots leads Kurtz to spout an Elmer Fudd line drawing an obvious comparison. It's a funny moment, but I'm not sure the film works on this level. The over the top gross elements take it to a different plane.<br /><br />The story? The story is as cartoony and outlandish as the rest of the film. As we watch, it continues to become more outrageous. Who cares. I'm not going to a film called \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" looking for an Academy Award caliber performance. The story is supposed to be silly.<br /><br />\\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is not a perfect film.

6305718954|5.0|I don't usually watch the kind of movie I thougth this was -- avoid them, religiously. (pun intended) But when I saw the cast, and found a copy of the video for cheap, I had to investigate.     Both Burne and Arquette were wonderful in this, and the visual images were arresting and beautiful. (The flashes of images of crucifixion made religious stories so much more real to me than dunking one's head in a bucket o' blood, like Some Other Movies have done.) But I found the point of the movie to be thrilling, and it instigated in me a lot of new thought and hope.     I was so glad to see how many other people have questioned religion without giving up faith -- or the quest for truth. I had heard of the Nag Hammadi Gospels, but didn't really know what they were. This was a lovely way to introduce me to them, and it inspired me to check them out.     The teachings of the man who threw the moneychangers out of the temple, who came to tell people that there's more to religion than sacrificing a pigeon, have been turned into another monstrous institution that crushes people under the wheels of its machinery. This film dares to question what this Religion has become, and to invite people to hear the words of a simple rabbi in Galilee, who -- far from owning the world's most expensive real estate -- owned nothing more than the clothes on his back.     Great entertainment, intriguing and thought-provoking, and a reward for those who don't follow The Gospel of Movie Critics.
B000002LMK|5.0|This is an incredible tour de force from Neil Young and Crazy Horse.  This is the Neil Young disc for people who don't like Neil Young but love got guitar-driven rock.  I agree with Tomato Pie that this is not grunge.  Carlos Santana likes to make his guitar \\"cry.\\"  In earlier work,  Neil often made his guitar scream - Songs like Southern Man come to mind.  On this CD, his guitar literally sings - it is melodic and lyric. The interplay with Crazy Horse gives some of the best double lead since Layla.     Don't get me wrong, you want to play this LOUD to feel its power, but it is classic rock in the very best sense. The guitar intro to Days That Used to Be sounds a bit like John Mellencamp when he was known as John Cougar (although the melody sounds not unlike the Byrds' version of Dylan's My Back Pages).  The guitar lines in Over and Over and Love and Only Love sound like REM on steroids - what they might be able to do if they would just let loose and turn up the volume on their amps.    Neil's singing on this disc is the best I have ever heard him sound, and there is even some really good harmony with Crazy Horse. He sings with a maturity and conviction that drives home the messages in the songs.     I have never paid much attention to drumming on Neil Young cd's, but Ralph Molina does a masterful job on this disc - Nothing flashy, just a steady, hard-driving beat that keeps the longer numbers burning and churning.    There is some of Neil Young's classic country rock on this disc with Country Home and White Line, but make no mistake, they are rockers.    I could have done without Farmer John, but there he does create a grunge sound.      This is an album you want to stick in your car's CD player when you are on a long drive.  Turn it up and feel the intensity of this work. But a word of caution - remember to keep one hand on the wheel, because you will want to play air guitar. It is incredible.  Buy two copies and give one to your best friend, who will never stop thanking you. It is that good.
0345479092|5.0|I love this book, because it covers many of the questions that I had as a new mom, and adds the 'why' behind the how. The writing style is clear and sitautions recognizable. The topics range from how to prepare your baby to start sleeping through the night, to breastfeeding/formula and dealing with other insecuries (and minimizing them!). I stopped reading any of the other books, because this seemed like the most sensible solution to setting up the baby's routine and keep your own sanity. I think we all wish we had a Tracy in our house for a few days!
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Great new CD, Sometimes Born to Run and sometimes The Risin'. Songs have impact. Looking forward to the Arnhemshow '07-11. Why is Soozie not a member of The E-street Band and why is Terry's song missing on my CD?
B0002WS3RS|5.0|First let me say, this is one of my favorite albums in the world.  Second, this is one of the best remastering jobs I've ever heard.  The high end is clear and sharp, the low end is tight and punchy, and there is no annoying 'bump' in the high mids that mars so many progressive rock remasters.  Hand it to the dutch for using their ears instead of their meters and dials.  If you remember the old Virgin vinyl lp, then you know how good this album could sound.  If you owned the Charly CD, you know how bad it could sound.  The follow-up release, You, has also been remastered and it, too, sounds better than the lp.  Now when will they get to The Flying Teapot.  My old Charly CD never sounded so bad.<br /><br />Hats off also for the four bonus songs.  Two of them are single edits.  The Other Side Of The Sky, I believe, was the French b-side to I Never Glid Befoa, but I could be wrong.  Ooby Scooby Doomsday used to be on the vinyl Gong Live etc.  I've heard it said this song is a waste of time.  I think it's one of the great lost Gong songs and it deserves to be in any comprehensive library of the band's recordings.  Another is Blues For Findlay from the soundtrack to Continental Circus, which was made around the time of Camembert Electrique.  I wish we could get that on CD again.
B000WMVJ7E|5.0|If you haven't cared for Wes Anderson movies in the past, THE DARJEELING LIMITED will probably not help you get over that hurdle.  In my opinion, his flat-out funniest film is still THE ROYAL TENNANBAUMS...but if you don't like that, it's hard to imagine you would like DARJEELING.    On the other hand, if you're a fan of the quirky, dead-pan, drier than dust humor, coupled with unorthodox camera work (a motionless camera, or a camera that moves side to side but seldom in and out) and fanciful art direction, DARJEELING should be your cup of tea (pun intended).    Three estranged brothers, each carrying a load of psychic baggage, come together on a ramshackle train in India to go our a \\"journey of spiritual growth.\\"  This journey has been arranged by the oldest brother, Owen Wilson.  He tells them that he wants them to bond and grow close again.  And in a way, this is true...but it also appears he wants them to help each other come to terms with the grief over their father's death (although he may not even realize this is a goal) and he has one other destination in mind that is a big secret (which I'll try not to spoil here.)    Middle brother is Adrien Brody, who is expecting to become a father any day now, but hasn't even bothered to tell his wife that he's going on this trip.  His grief over the loss of his father is mostly obviously displayed, because he is wearing this father's glasses, even though the prescription probably isn't right for him.    The youngest brother is Jason Schwartzman, who is grappling with a prolong breakup with his girlfriend (played by Natalie Portman in a little movie called HOTEL CHEVALIER which is now thankfully being played as part of this film's theatrical release.  I can't imagine enjoying DARJEELING properly without having seen it).  Schwartzman is also a writer, and he has brought with him a handwritten draft of a new short story which obviously has resonance for his brothers.    These three are oddballs, to say the least.  They really don't belong in India, and really struggle to get along with each other.  They are classic Anderson characters, removed from their emotions, full of verbal and physical quirks and tics, supremely intelligent and hugely sad.    At the beginning of the film, Bill Murray makes a brief cameo appearance.  Is there any actor better at being funny with so much sadness working today?  In LOST IN TRANSLATION, his character, while witty, was burdened with sadness.  In Anderson's  much maligned THE LIFE AQUATIC, Murray is nearly crippled with his sadness.  Murray has brought this to an art form not really seen since perhaps the time of Chaplin.  So his early appearance in DARJEELING almost helps to set that mood of sadness that permeates virtually every moment of the film.  But this does not make it oppressive.  The beautiful country of India, the colorful settings (the train itself is a marvel of design) and the off-the-wall incidents that occur keep the audience happily engaged.    What I like about Anderson's characters is that they generally do not carry anger.  So often in films, characters who are grieving or holding in some other emotion will frequently burst out in anger or violence.  It's become an easy cliché.  However, Anderson's characters are sad.  They tamp down on that sadness, and when it does bubble up, it's seldom a physical explosion, but more of a collapse.  They are touchingly simple moments, usually.  Because the characters have spent most of the movie squashing their feelings, when they DO come up, it is all the more effective for the viewer.  There are moments in DARJEELING of simple, touching sadness...and they are very effective.    So yes, this is not a happy movie.  I think in many ways, people are turned off by the films because they are expecting a quirky but harmless comedy.  However, in ROYAL TENNANBAUMS, Ben Stiller has a scene of such startling sadness and pain that it is almost too much for the viewer.  In LIFE ACQUATIC, Murray's character suffers a very painful loss near the end of the film, taking the viewer into an area that they probably didn't want to go.  And DARJEELING has a couple of moments that are totally unexpected, including a scene when the brothers are kicked off the train for bad behavior and wander into a rural village just in time to plunge into some earth-shattering events.  I know some viewers and some critics find the change in tone shocking and unwelcome.  For me, it was a powerful moment...and a poignant one.  Also, a vivid reminder that just because a movie (or life) appears to be going in one direction...don't be surprised if it takes a different turn.      All three leads are terrific.  It's particularly nice to see Wilson back in form...reminding us that he is capable of something other than the complete goofball he can play in his sleep.  Angelica Huston has a small, but critical role and she is very good too.      Also, I have to mention the terrific soundtrack.  The three obscure songs from The Kinks are highlights for me, and turned the album into a must have!  I never dreamed that \\"Powerman\\" would ever be used in a film...but it's brilliant.    As I wrote this review, I realized that I was going to have to see the movie again this weekend.  I can't wait for the DVD release.  To me, it was that good.  But again, if you don't like Anderson films, you probably won't like this one either (although, I can keep my fingers crossed that you may try anyway...and end up impressed.)

B000OVLBGC|5.0|_The Lives of Others_ (2006) is a German language film which presents a disturbing portrayal of the Communist East German state in 1984.  The film shows a society in which the government engages in constant spying on private citizens, ruthless interrogation of would-be and suspected dissenters, and a culture in which the average citizen lives in fear of being blacklisted by the powers that be and in fear of their neighbors who might snitch on them to the secret police.  The film illustrates the usual communist fear of intellectuals and artists (\\"arrogant types who need to be monitored\\") and the constant need of the artist or intellectual to conform to the dictates of party ideology in order to avoid being blacklisted or worse.  The film also shows the corruption of the East German government officials, as they use women as prostitutes (often against their will), engage in petty maneuverings, and must constantly suck up to the higher-ups or \\"bigwigs\\" in the party in order to obtain favors or promotions.  The film also shows the inability of East Germans to leave their country (with very few exceptions) and the manner in which the party has utterly sucked the very life out from the people through the Stasi secret police.  In sum, the film shows a surveillance society at its most Orwellian under a corrupt and evil government which oppresses the people.  Such was the government of East Germany during the time period that this film is supposed to take place.    _The Lives of Others_ focuses on the life and career of the playwright Georg Dreyman, who remains among the only playwrights still deemed sufficiently loyal to the regime to be allowed to produce their plays.  While watching a play of Dreyman, the Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler concludes that Dreyman is a \\"dangerous type\\" and thus deserves to be spied on.  Wiesler sets up a series of microphones in Dreyman's apartment and in that manner listens in on him and his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria.  The goings on ofDreyman remain relatively mundane and there is little evidence of subversive activity.  However, it is while at a party that Dreyman encounters his old friend and fellow playwright Jerska who has been blacklisted.  Further, it is revealed that Dreyman's girlfriend is being forced to have sex with the Chairman Hempf.  Dreyman remains loyal to the party until one day Jerska commits suicide which along with his girlfriend's affairs pushes him over the edge.  Together with his friends they decide to publish a report on suicide within the GDP (East Germany) and sneak this report over to the West.  The rest of the movie reveals how this conspiracy plays out and the role of Wiesler becomes increasingly important.  Surprisingly, Wiesler may not be the evil man and loyal member of the Stasi that we had originally suspected him of being.  To see how this plays out in the film you must watch the movie.    This film is an excellent movie which shows the paranoia that existed under a communist dictatorship.  The secret police rule a nation and the only way to achieve any sort of success or security is through truckling to higher powers.  As such, we see the complete demoralization of the people who are forced to live under a corrupt government and the complete failure of the communist enterprise.  This film is highly recommended to those who would consider these issues.  However, the film also reveals that even amidst such a totalitarian dictatorship there exist opportunities to display human kindness and graciousness.  As such the film may be seen as a triumph for humanity, despite the corrupting powers of governments.  Highly recommended.
0307346617|5.0|As a zombie book, this novel is a little dry.  It doesn't really focus on the \\"action\\" so common in zombie stories.  We don't really have vivid scenes of zombies shambling around, murmuring \\"brains\\" at everything that moves.  What this book lacks in \\"horror\\" it makes up for, and in spades, as one of the most insightful social commentaries written, possibly since Upton Sinclair.  READ THIS BOOK!!!  If you are a sociologist, or a historian, or a political scientist, read this book.  It is one of the clearest and most accurate portrayals of the international reaction to a mass extinction level event, and how various nations would deal with the woes they would soon face.  This is absolutely a must read!
0143038583|4.0|The Stern Librarian now feels just a little less satisfied when she heats her organic TV dinner in the break room microwave.  The most useful part of this book is its demystification of the \\"organic\\" label.  It turns out that even my organic half and half is really not produced in the red barn surrounded by grassy fields on the carton, although it is very human of us to need to believe the homespun, bucolic narratives that line the walls of certain grocery stores.   This is one of those works of journalism that consists of a great deal of summarization and explication of other writers' research, combined with a little first hand investigation that sounds like it was as taxing to perform as Peter Mayles' forays into the French countryside for a new Provence book.  The author may have been denied entry to a slaughterhouse, but in any case he seems much more comfortable hunting mushrooms in Berkeley with a chef from Chez Panisse.  This book borrows its journey from inferno to purgatory to paradise from Dante, but nature better invent a better tasting hamburger if it wants to convince kids that fast food is hell.  The Stern Librarian (My worst dilemma is what to read next).
B000ULQV0W|5.0|My wife and I stumbled out of a Manhattan theater in stunned silence. In San Diego, so did my 22 year-old stepson. So has everyone I've urged to see \\"Into the Wild\\".<br /><br />The film is the story of Christopher McCandless, who graduated from college (Emory, '92), then left civilization behind to experience life without constraints. His death in Alaska few months later made him a worthy subject for Jon Krakauer. But the story he tells in his book, \\"Into the Wild,\\" is even better inspiration for a film, especially when the writer-director is Sean Penn.<br /><br />Think what you will about Penn --- the guy has guts to spare. He stands up for what he believes and he doesn't mumble when he offers unpopular ideas. And in his acting, as in his life, he's always searching for the authentic --- just remember that scene in \\"Mystic River\\" when he tries to bull his way through a wall of cops to get to the body of his murdered daughter.<br /><br />So his movie does not touch hardcore New Yorkers and West Coast surfer/law students and all kinds of people in between because we share a love of raw Nature in Alaska --- Penn didn't make a movie about a kid who stepped out of civilization with just a bag of rice and a book about edible plants to get him through. Nor did he make this film to ask us to decide: \\"Chris McCandless --- was he an idiot?\\" The questions he asks in this movie are much larger: freedom, identity, community. That is, the questions obsessing us just below the surface of our most ordinary days.<br /><br />We watch this long movie that has an ending we already know with something like obsession because Chris McCandless carries our proxy. At one time or other, we all want to walk out of the familiar. And, far more often, we think of \\"freedom\\" nostalgically --- as something we once had.<br /><br />But Chris McCandless....he's going for it. And the film goes it for it with him --- it's about stepping through doors, moving through landscape, seeking an ever-widening sky. And then there's the music, which is even more expansive and exuberant.<br /><br />This is not \\"soundtrack\\" music, a grab bag of songs cobbled together to provide a revenue stream. This is Eddie Vedder, usually the leader of Pearl Jam, here solo, with stripped-down instrumentation and blunt lyrics:<br /><br />I knew all the rules<br />But the rules did not know me<br />Guaranteed<br /><br />Imagine that in Vedder's baritone --- singing so truthful it merges with the quest of the movie. The words progress from leaving the known world (\\"Society/You're a crazy breed/I hope you're not lonely/Without me\\") to motion (\\"Gonna rise up/Turning mistakes into gold\\") to a message so primal it's really chanting (\\"I am...I AM\\").<br /><br />I've read a bunch of civilian reviews of Vedder's soundtrack, many saying something like this: \\"It's simply awesome. I can't find the words to describe how it affected me at a soul level.\\" Oddly, though I usually have words pouring out of my fingertips, I'm at a bit of a loss myself. I mean, this CD is just 30+ minutes long (and it repeats one song). Pearl Jam's nowhere to be found. And yet \\"Into the Wild\\" is stuck in my player, or, rather, re-player --- it can pump me up all morning if I'm not careful.<br /><br />Is it depressing? Not in the least. This is traveling music --- highway travel and interior journey --- that has an uncanny ability to re-create the feelings you have when you've broken free of the pack and the road is clear. Death may await, but not here. This is about the glory of risk, the sweetness of freedom, the crisp breath of purity.<br /><br />Do you need to have seen the movie to love this music? Not at all. To hear the music is to see the movie. Or, more correctly, your movie, the film in which you star and sprint and soar and roar --- music as great as you are in most glorious moments.<br /><br />Beware: Repeated listening could cast a spell on you.

B000UJ48VI|3.0|Film in need of intensive care. With 2 1/2 hours of special features on the two disc version of 2001, how could this Kubrick gem come out the same way as the previous versions? I knew in advance that it was a single disc, but I was at least hopeing for a commentary track, but not even that. I know Sue Lyon would probably never consent to doing or even adding to a commentary track, that would be expecting too much, but a film historion would do. I think it took courage to make this film back then. There are a lot of black and white gems from the mid to late 50s to the early 60s that arn`t even out on DVD yet. Maybe in the next six years or so it will come out with extras. I gave it 3 stars, because it still drops my jaw when I watch it, and it really is a noir, in that a man is being lead to his doom, as are all concerned, and gosh darn it Peter is sooo creepy.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|I bought his first album, and loved all the songs that didn't get much radio play. I am one of those that searches for talent, not marketing or radio play based on what corporate folks want us to think is good. They mostly get it wrong anyway. Well this new album does not scream radio play, there are not to many catchy hooks, except 1973....which was first radio release, proves my point. But the rest of the album, Wow. Listen to \\"I really want you\\", and \\"the same mistake\\"....there are parts of these 2 songs that he speaks from the heart and you get goose bumps. \\"Shine\\" is incredible...This album, while it will not tickle to radio jocks...(screw them anyway)...is hands down better than the first...buy it, turn off the radio...and play it over and over...you'll see.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|Wow! What a way to end season 1 and season 2 starts off just as edge of seat!  Really enjoyed the new line of direction.
0375846735|1.0|A sentence in the acknowledgements caught my eye in which the author writes that he stole from everything he's read.  Indeed, he's seemingly stolen every clich&eacute; and hackneyed contrivance possible and compiled every single one of them to create this most laboriously boring book.  At some points the ridiculousness of his tale garnered a laugh or two, but I really should have taken my brother up on his offer just to tell me how it ended and not wasted the time finishing it.<br /><br />Those characters about whom we've come to care, no longer develop, but are merely written with wild inconsistency utterly untrue to their previously described natures.  They become little more than shells and mouthpieces for the author's ideologies.  In that line, there's an insufferable number of, \\"rousing,\\" speeches - total drivel.  Half of the chapters saddle us with the cheesy adventures of Dr. Malone, through whom the author does most of his self-indulgent, blatantly self-justifying moralizing.  She is the most tedious dud.<br /><br />The chief villain, who doesn't even show up or exert much presence until well into the latter part of the book, is a total let down and completely untrue to the sort of villain he'd have to be to perpetrate all he's perpetrated or even reflect anything the author has said about him.  Once presented, he is hastily defeated in an outright literary cop out.<br /><br />Really, the author is much like what he intones about his uber-villain: largely unseen, hiding behind his impersonal, authorial authority; underhandedly manipulative; a voice destitute of any real, constructive philosophy.

B000F3TBIO|4.0|If I just heard this, like I did one night watching Conan O'Brian, when they played their first... Hit???  Whatever, I would say it was a tight band with a cool song, and I would purchase the album and get into it.  This is pretending I'm not a Mike Patton fan.  Problem is, is that I AM ONE.  I am a huge fan, as big as they come, I am a collector of rare Patton CDs and DVDs and have Heard and Seen EVERYTHING.  I'm always on the Patton bandwagon, while my best friend's favorite band is FANTOMAS while he would never listen to ANY other Patton project right now... unless Bungle came back.  This album should have been promoted more... and I blame Patton for that... this should have been shopped around instead of coming out on Ipecac Records.  Well, they got to open for The Who (The only bootleg DVDs available) and then there were.... NO BOOTLEGS... seemed as no one cared, so Patton took them to Europe where they love anything he does - I mean, stuff like \\"Moonchild\\" (not Moonraker) and \\"Onitaba\\" goes over well in front of his Euro-avante-gard fans.  The guy had a perfect opportunity to put out a ROCK album with Tomahawk, but gives us something different with the album Anonymous that was VERY original and great and everything but in the end it's like... \\"oh, anohter weird Patton album.\\"  So, it's up to him what he's going to do next, but, this album?  I had the demo for a LONG time, and most of it is what's on the demo, just different words and different artists that pop up and it's a cool pop album that should have tried to sell themseleves to a bigger label.  I like it.... But what is it?  It's IT.... What is it?... (check out the movie FIRECRACKER with Patton in a lead role)
B000TGCR38|5.0|It is not a straightforward story, not by any means. In the beginning there is a line: based on actual events. Perhaps it is true, maybe life is beyond imagination (or the collective beyond any one person's ability to imagine), things have happened that we can not envision, that truth is stranger than fiction. In any case, this is better than any mystery or whodunit movie i can remember, having those sublime moments where you want to hide your eyes because you know something really bad is going to happen to those sympathetic characters you have come to like but are forced open by the realization that you have no idea of what is going to happen to them and you don't want to miss a second of it. I was frustrated at my inability to guess who was the really bad guy, i was shocked at the chain of events at almost every turn and the twists are just plain devious and demented. It is an excellent mystery, a tormented look into how ordinary people react in extraordinary circumstances, a set historical piece with careful attention to detail and a love story, something for everyone (even as the box says: rated R for strong violence, graphic nudity, sexuality and language) Like i said, something for everyone.<br /><br />I put it into the category of a must see movie. a 5 star.<br />there is a very good synopsis of the movie's plot over at the wiki. I could do no better than to encourage people to go read it. Nothing i could write could approach it in completeness. What i'd like to think about is heroes. Especially in the wake of Ken Burn's series on the War, i've been thinking about ordinary people doing heroic things when called upon by extraordinary times. And how so few people seem to be the right kind of heroes. We have lots of heroic efforts in war time, sadly the best and most energies seem to be called out of people when they try to kill each other, or try to survive being killed. The energies of Germany under Hitler ignited Europe, the heroic efforts of people literally burned down and destroyed the work of centuries. Heroes on the American assembly lines of B24's, many or even most women working for the first time out of the house, created waves of thousands of bombers to ignite European and Japanese cities. Heroes on the ground cleaned up the rubble and continued to build their tanks and armaments long after ordinary people would have quit and died. On both sides great heroic energies were called forth out of ordinary people who often rose to the occasion and did things that they themselves could not have imagined just a few years before. Maybe it is the curse of ordinary times that people sleep walk through life never encountering such events that allow them to show what they are really made up of. Maybe it is the salvation of ordinary times that we so seldom encounter such terrible years. But the shame is that they always seem to involve war, never the call to higher ideals and a life of sacrifice to loftier, more noble goals.<br /><br />In this movie we have examples of three types of people rising far above themselves and entering into that realm of heroes. The key character of Rachel, who is ready to do anything to avenge the cruel death of her family, These are our \\"normal\\" heroes, those we hold up to future generations and teach them that this is how they ought to act in extraordinary times, knowing full well that we didn't in our day and probably nor will they. Then there is the anti-hero, those heroes literally working for the wrong side, Muntze is this sort of person, trying to negotiate a truce with the Resistance. Daring to love in the midst of what he knows will be a losing war for his side, forcing the truth out of Rachel and using it to try to disarm his sadist and cruel commander. There is another kind of \\"hero\\" as well, if we think of a hero as an ordinary people who responds in amazing ways to these extraordinary events. These too come wearing  black and white hats, some we recognize and have admired for a longtime- the Resistance and those pitifully few Europeans who sheltered the Jews from the Nazi rage and death camps. They are protrayed in the movie, like real people with feet of clay, a farm family with Rachel in the barn allowed to eat if she memorizes a verse of New Testament every day before breakfast. Resistance members who exclaim that 40 good Dutchmen and worth more than any number of blank blank Jews. It is these sympathetic, well drawn, realistic characters that really give this movie depth and interest, that make it a really good movie worth thinking about.<br /><br />But like the movie, bracketed by two old friend's chance meeting in Israel, the real heroes of the story are women and how they respond to the evil, cruelty and death of war.<br />Ronnie is the anti-hero for Rachel, the woman who gives into temptation and joins the party. She is the one who survives because she collaborates, she cooperates, she sleeps with the enemy.<br />But Rachel too sleeps with the enemy, deliberately and with great preparation and seduction, yet she falls in love with the enemy, the ultimate betrayal and hopes to spend the rest of her life with him, if only the fates allow. Where Ronnie takes lightly what life offers, Rachel grabs and holds on for dear life. It is this constant contrast that the movie strives for and is it's big point,  Heroes are ordinary people, doing extraordinary things, all the time demonstrating the mixture of good and evil that lives within us all. Those good Dutch people who pounce upon anyone at the end of the war labelled a collaborator and one almost beats Rachel to death because she stands up to their torment and will not publically strip and humilate herself.  Those women like Ronnie who jump into the Canadian jeeps in the same way they jumped into the Nazi conqueror's 4 years before. It is a protrayal of the clay feet of our heroes, the twisted ways people respond to extraordinary events, each trying to make enough breathing space to keep them and their loved ones alive until ordinary times return.<br /><br />In the movie we recognize pieces of how we hope we would react to similar events, those heroes who rise well above and beyond, those villains who capitulate and sell out their friends for their own lives, those greed and gold possessed souls who think of nothing but how to steal and escape to live out their lives in comparative wealth and safety. It is the strength of the movie, and it's underlying script that these things are presented to our conscious minds for our consideration and analysis.

B000FDFVZ6|5.0|My grandmother gave me this book for Christmas almost 5 years ago. I had tried a few times to read it, but just couldn't get into it. When I read that it was being made into a movie, I decided I should read it. Since being given the book, my grandmother (who was my favorite person on earth) passed away. Her death was sudden, and I had never really coped with it. I had cried, but I still always have the \\"wow, she would love this,\\" or the \\"what would she suggest\\" thoughts running through my mind. The point is, I think this book helped a little. It's just simply an amazing book. I was intrigued and haunted by the sentence \\"My delicious death moan.\\" Sebold pairs words and phrases in ways that I never thought possible. Even if you haven't lost someone very dear to you, you will still love this book. I finished it in a day, and could have kept reading. I had read \\"Lucky\\" while in high school, and loved it as well. While very different, this book is just as wonderful.
B000000WA4|4.0|If you happened, like me, to be like the kids in the car in the video of \\"1979,\\" having one of those titanic parents-aren't-home parties that the whole town shows up to and everything gets trashed, every bedroom has kids making out in them, kids diving in the pool, wrecking stuff, kissing, fighting, dancing, drinking, kegs, driving, 7-Eleven burnt-out afterward... You and your friends drive to the top of the hill, park, get out, yell at your stinking town, drive around some more, drinking, smoking, windows down, alive to your possibility, to your own death, energized for anything, everything, the boredom, the hurtling of senseless existence, the cool of being without style, without anything but the moment... How I survived all that exploding to be hunched over in the dark tonight, tapping away lonely at a keyboard, washed up like old bones on the beach, bald, aging, as the world they all made slides into the fires of san diego, the drought of atlanta, the horrors everywhere that we turned our backs to in 1979 and swore to reject, to never become part of, they've surrounded me and I've surrendered to them, the mellon collie and infinite sadness settles over me from the knowledge that there are many more years left in the long slide down, and it only will get worse. Where are all those beautiful kids we burned out with, growing old and replaced by new kids, besides in the few heartbreaking songs on things like this overwrought album, where in a few aching moments, the smashing pumpkins got it right?
B00000HZTB|5.0|This was the first Lou Reed solo album I picked up.  Never before had I read so many good reviews of one album.  Many critics were beside themselves over this, so naturally I was intrigued.  So I bought it, and it's one of Lou's greatest albums.  I absolutely adore it.  It still sounds fresh and invigorating today.  Lou's music, both solo and with The Velvet Underground, has not dated at all, unlike a lot of other music from that time period.  The opening song, My House, is majestic and moving, and Lou actually sings and holds notes very well.  Underneath the Bottle is a great song, the title track is full of feedback and brilliant, vengeful lyrics.  Waves of Fear is like this as well.  Heavenly Arms is a beautiful closer, dedicated to his then wife, Sylvia, who helped get him cleaned up and focused again.  Lou's 70's output wasn't horrible as some have suggested.  A lot of his persona was about how he dressed, and the critics ignored or lambasted his music.  Some of it sucked (Metal Machine Music anyone), but some of it was very good (Street Hassle, parts of The Bells, Berlin, and Transformer).  However, his 80's output was some of the best of his long career.  This is a great album that you should pick up as soon as you can....
B000VDDDY6|2.0|I've been a fan since day 1 in the 1960s, and have seen how Paramount has over-charged for the various incarnations of the DVDs over the years of sale. Let's remember that Paramount has long recovered the initial production costs of these products. Back in the '60s, the actors and production crew didn't have the royalty contracts of today (which still remunerate the various talents at a fraction of what the studios make on the products). So, Paramount, in knowing of our loyalty and love of Star Trek, has preyed upon those qualities for many years.    Enter the new HD versions of TOS. I have seen them on local T.V.; they're gorgeous! The effects when I first saw them blew me away! The re-worked music brought tears to my eyes; what a treat! However, this loyal fan AND shareholder of Viacom stock will not continue to contribute to the blood-suckers at CBS/Paramount. I will enjoy the TOS episodes on local T.V. and also my TOS DVDs at home; I urge all to boycott this continued abuse of the Star Trek fanbase.
0143038419|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It isn't a fast read, but still very enjoyable.  It is written in three sections, and after each section I was sure I wouldn't enjoy her next location as much as the last.  But each time I was glad to be wrong.  Each location and focus for that visit was refreshing and educational.  I learned so much from this book, and was eager to pass it along to my mother.  I told her I thought she would love it and was eager to hear if my guess was correct.  Within a day or so of her starting the book, she called me to say she was enjoying it as much as I had.  Multiple times during her read she called to thank me for recommending the book.  She then passed the book to one of her sisters!    The only problem I have with the book is that after reading it, I crave world travel!  I am very envious of her journey.  But am happy I could at least experience through her words.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I have been listening to MCR for quite sometime (I saw them open for Thursday back in the day), and like most older fans I prefer the original above all (I liked Three Cheers, not the Black Parade so much). It is by far their most raw, inaccessible, dark album to date, since they were not yet the \\"mainstream\\" dark pseudo-gothic band that they've become. Here Gerard Way is giving his heart and soul, and honestly I prefer these songs musically (even without the Guitar Hero solos, and string arrangements). This showed the raw potential that the big record labels were looking to exploit, and turn into mainstream corporate rock (face it that's where it's at now).

B000W4HFY8|4.0|This cd of Twin Peaks \\"Season Two Music And More\\" is GREAT! My only regret is that it does not include the acoustic guitar version of the main Twin Peaks theme, which was heard during the scene where Ben Horne is watching the old film of when he and his brother were kids at the dedication ceremony for the Great Northern. That is one of my favorite scenes from season two, and I was very disappointed that the music from that scene was left off of this cd.

1860498833|4.0|This was my first book by S. Waters and I was impressed! All the twists and turns will have you at the edge of your seat!<br /><br />The two flaws I found were: (1) she could have told the story in fewer pages; some parts of the book were very slow-moving and didn't seem to add much value, and (2) compared to the rest of the book, the end seemed very rushed.
B000WS4P1K|1.0|I love John Mayer's work, but are you kidding me? $23 for another copy of Continuum and five of its songs recorded live? Making customers feel exploited at every turn might be one of the things wrong with the recorded music business.
0618680004|5.0|This book changed my life.  After reading it, I was able to leave behind the shaky world of \\"spirituality\\" and other ill-defined concepts.  I learned to trust only what is real and rational, which is a great relief for me.  I admire Richard Dawkins and his courage in proclaiming himself a staunch atheist.  The book is well-written and actually very funny.
042521771X|4.0|I loved this book. I got it from library to see if I liked it first and now intend to buy it. Of all Jane's heroes, I like Mr. Knightley the best. He has substance. I also like the simplicity of the book - Amanda Grange does not embelish like some other Jane wannabees. This book reminds me of the book by Joan Austen-Leigh (Visit to Highbury)telling Emma from Mrs. Goddard's point of view. I have re-read that many times.
B000002WFF|5.0|From the 1968 Comeback special through 1971, Elvis recorded argueably the best music of his career. This album, along with \\"From Elvis In Memphis\\" are probably the best two complete sets of songs from during this era. With the orchestra filling in behind him, Elvis makes every song sound absolutely fabulous. The top songs on this album include \\"Mary In The Morning\\", \\"Twenty Days And Twenty Nights\\", \\"Just Pretend\\", \\"Stranger In The Crowd\\" and \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin\\".     And to me, the song that stands out head and shoulders above all the others (and that is hard to do in this bunch of songs that is so strong from top to bottom), is the masterful rendition of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\". It has got to be one of my favorite Elvis performances of all time. It just reaches out and grabs you and leaves you breathless with your heart pounding by the end.     All in all, if you ever get any Elvis albums, this has got to be one of the top 5 in your Presley collection. Can't say enough about it.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|This was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen (surpassed only by \\"Battlefield Earth\\"). I have enjoyed David Lynch weirdness in the past (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, etc.) but this movie was just terrible. Imagine three hours of ambient music and random nonsensical scenes with no connection whatsoever, not even a semblance of a plot. Even the actors have no idea what the movie is about (just read one of the interviews on line). This was a self-indulgent P.O.S. Save your time and just rewatch Twin Peaks.  Also, I really have no idea why people are ranting and raving about Laura Dern's performance.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower's Bridge Of Sighs (1974) is about as close to Hendrix as you can get without actually listening to Jimi. It's that good. It's no wannabe or second-string imitation, either. Bridge Of Sighs is the real thing, standing on it's own merit as a rock-guitar masterpiece, and it's one of my all-time favorite albums. From the hard rocking Day Of The Eagle, The Fool And Me and Little Bit Of Sympathy to the slow, wickedly sad and beautiful Bridge Of Sighs, In This Place and About To Begin, this album is outstanding. There is not a bad, or even mediocre, song on the album. Trower's prowess on the Fender Stratocaster guitar is simply amazing, and bassist James Dewar's deep, soulful vocals are powerful and mesmerizing. Reg Isidore mercilessly pounds the drums, and he gives the songs an enthusiastic, beat-heavy sound. Trower's guitar sound is remarkably like Hendrix's, only with more reverb and less feedback. You can hear snippets of Jimi's Crosstown Traffic and Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) here and there on Bridge Of Sighs, but Robin takes the style in a new direction, blending in his own unique approach, and building on the foundation of the guitar sound that Jimi Hendrix invented. Bridge Of Sighs is Robin Trower's masterpiece, and it's an album that should be in every rock-guitar aficionado's collection. You don't want to miss this one!
630542828X|3.0|I'll be completely honest here.  I saw `A Civil Action' because I am in love with James Gandolfini.  Sadly his character has very little screen time although he is quite convincing with what he has to work with.  What I found though was a nice little court room drama that is interesting as much as it is frustrating and deserves at least a little attention.  This movie is by no means a brilliant film, but it does sport a few excellent performances that help elevate the plot and leave the audience at least satisfied with the overall effect of the film.<br /><br />`A Civil Action' is based on a true story of the small town of Woburn Massachusetts where two large corporations through carelessness and negligence poisoned the drinking water thus resulting in the deaths of eight children.  The town hires Jan Schlichtmann, a personal injury attorney, to find out what killed their children and get them an apology.  Money is not important to them, but as Schlichtmann points out, money is how these corporations apologize.  Jan, who was initially apposed to the case, becomes personally invested which, as he brings out, is the worst thing a lawyer can do.  As he goes to battle with the lawyers for the two corporations, WR Grace and Beatrice Foods, it appears he may be in way over his head.<br /><br />Where the movie shines is in interaction between Schlichtmann and rival lawyer Jerome Facher, thanks in large part to the performances by both Travolta and Duvall.  John Travolta may play Schlichtmann almost a polar opposite to the actual man himself, but this to me helps aid the film along.  Travolta is very cool and collected here, very polished and confident and that helps the audience feel drawn to him.  He's going after what he believes in and no one will stop him and that is a very endearing or at least admirable quality.  Robert Duvall is the perfect complement to Travolta here.  He gives Facher so much charisma that the viewer can't keep their eyes and mind off of him.  His performance is brilliantly executed and well deserving of the Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Where the movie falters though is the one place I was really hoping that it would shine and that is of the aftermath of the events on the survivors.  Don't get me wrong, the performances by the likes of Kathleen Quinlan and James Gandolfini are excellent and portray enough pain and even quilt but they are limited in their effectiveness because so much focus is shifted to the battle between lawyers.  It would have been nice to have the focus more on the families and their struggle for answers.  If this had been the focal point of the movie I think it would have transcended the average legal drama and become something much more.<br /><br />The performances throughout are all commendable, not just those of Travolta, Duvall, Quinlan and Gandolfini.  William H. Macy especially deserves some commendation.  His portrayal of James Gordon is brilliant.  John Lithgow is also exceptionally good as Judge Walter J. Skinner.  He's very powerful, and that's not something I expected from him.  Sydney Pollack is great in his cameo, no matter how small his scene is, and delivers with expert conviction and Dan Hedaya is very hate-worthy as the malicious and selfish John Riley.  Tony Shalhoub and Zelijko Ivanek (who I just LOVED on `Damages') are sorely underused as Schlichtmann and Gordon's partners Kevin Conway and Bill Crowley; in fact I think I only heard Ivanek utter like two sentences.<br /><br />In the end `A Civil Action' is one of those movies that will not disappoint but it will not outstand either.  Aside from some on point acting it is truly a generic and formulistic film that has been done before, and better I might add, but it won't leave you wishing you hadn't wasted your time either.  Watch this for the legal banter and brilliance that is Duvall but don't expect too much in regards to a real emotional drama for, like Schlichtmann advises, the audience is never really allowed to get personally invested.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|British-American singer Stacey Kent's new album, \\"Breakfast On The Morning Tram,\\" shows the youthful jazz chanteuse with the sweet, yet strong voice, to be enjoying unprecedented growth in her career.  She's put together a bigger band, with a number of talented musicians, and she's allowed them lots of room to stretch on this disk.  She has also, for the first time, recorded original compositions: this album has only three songs from the Great American Songbook, on which she had so successfully relied until now.  She has also moved on from her first recording label, the small independent Candid, to the prestigious jazzy Blue Note.<br /><br />Kent, who was born in South Orange, New Jersey, met her talented husband, saxophonist, now producer/arranger/composer, Jim Tomlinson, with whom she works, while both were students at London's 125 year old Guildhall School of Music and Drama.  The singer, whose clear voice and delivery lie somewhere between the flirtatious sound of Norah Jones, and the ever-popular smoky barroom sound now delivered by Diana Krall and Claire Martin, among others, was initially championed by British critic and jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton.  She credits Joni Mitchell, Nick Drake, Nancy Wilson, and Cannonball Adderley as the biggest influences on her work.  She has won the 2001 British Jazz Award, and the 2002 British Broadcasting Corporation Jazz Award for Best Vocalist.  She has a large, devoted following that should be pleased by her newest release.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast\\" gives more than a nod to France, where Kent did post-graduate work, and is exceedingly popular: she was, in fact, signed by the Paris office of Blue Note.  The French gave the 2006 \\"Boy Next Door\\" Gold Album status within six months of its release.  They've greeted \\"Breakfast\\" by giving it, within six weeks of its release, Top #20 status on the general charts, and Top #10 status on the jazz charts; they've also given it an enthusiastic sell-out audience at Paris's legendary Olympia Music Hall.  The new album includes two songs Kent identifies as her personal favorites from the works of the French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, \\"Ces Petits Riens,\\" and \\"La Saison des Pluies.\\"  It also includes a cover of that rhythmic tune from \\"Un Homme et Une Femme,\\" (that'll be \\"A Man and A Woman,\\" to us), \\"Samba Saravah,\\" by Pierre Barouh.<br /><br />\\"So Many Stars\\" is another lilting samba on this Latin-tinged record, music by the Brazilian Sergio Mendes, words by the American powerhouse duo Marilyn and Alan Bergman.  In addition, Kent covers \\"Landslide,\\" by Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac, in tribute to the Colorado Rockies, where she and Tomlinson enjoy spending their down time.  \\"Never Let Me Go,\\" \\"Hard Hearted Hannah,\\" and \\"Wonderful World\\" are from the Great American Songbook that's served the singer so well.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Breakfast\\" boasts four unusual, outstanding new compositions, all with lyrics by British Booker Prize winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003 release \\"In Love Again,\\" and music by Tomlinson, with whose saxophone Kent sings in delicious close harmony.  These songs, the Latin-grooving \\"Ice Hotel,\\" the title song, \\"I Wish I Could Go Travelling Again,\\" and \\"So Romantic,\\" allow Kent's whispering voice to suggest, as Ishiguro has noted, almost a private, inner conversation, with its hesitations and asides, that remains close to the rhythms, inflections, and informalities of everyday speech.  But then, so many of her listeners feel that Kent is singing for them alone, telling a wistful story, as she likes to do.  Famous jazz lover Clint Eastwood asked her to perform at his 70th birthday party.  Most of us can't quite afford that, unfortunately, but I've been lucky enough to catch her a few times in her month-long stands at New York's esteemed Algonquin Hotel: and, yes, she's also played Carnegie Hall.

B00005JPAO|4.0|Going into `The Queen' I wasn't really expecting much at all.  My parents had seen the film and disliked it greatly sighting that it was boring and slow moving and nothing like they had expected.  Now I am never the one to follow my parent's advice, especially when it comes to entertainment, but there was something about this movie that screamed `TV Movie' to me and so I just didn't expect to like it much at all.  My wife wanted to see it though and so I conceded, and I must admit that since I love everything Oscar and feel this incessant need to embrace all that they embrace, at least so I can form an opinion, I wasn't hesitant about sitting down to watch the film.<br /><br />What I found though was a brilliantly crafted biopic that held my interest and proved to be highly entertaining.<br /><br />The film follows the days preceding the untimely death of Princess Diana and the media coverage of the Royal families reaction, or lack there of.  Young Tony Blair had just been elected Prime Minister before the tragedy and thus finds himself dealing with some very touchy issues very early on in his career.  The film does a fair job of trying to flesh out the motives of the royal family, especially those of the Queen herself, trying to make her appear real to the audience and maybe explain her strange behavior following the death of Princess Diana.<br /><br />This fleshing out of the Queen is due to the amazing portrayal by Oscar winner Helen Mirren.  This was a very challenging role even though it won't appear that way.  When watching Mirren converse and interact on the screen you will see no hysterics, no outburst of emotion, nothing that screams Oscar.  What you will see is a woman dealing with the situation that lay before her, the people in her life telling her one thing and another as well as her own thoughts and feelings on the matter.  What you will see is the buried emotion that hides behind her eyes as she takes in everything but never divulges a single emotion.  This my friends is very hard to do.  Hysterics and outbursts may be difficult to tame and make believable but completely reserved emotion is just as hard to accomplish.  Helen Mirren soars in this regard.<br /><br />The rest of the cast hold there own as well, especially Michael Sheen who portrays Tony Blair as both thoughtful and understanding.  Blair is probably the most well rounded character aside from the Queen herself here, the balance of the cast falling a bit into the background proving to be more or less accessories to the two main characters.  James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms do excellent work here as Prince Philip and the Queen Mother (was it just me or did they make Helen Mirren up to look OLDER than Syms who was playing her mother), both providing some explanation as to the Queens actions that given week.  Both Philip and Elizabeth are portrayed as very headstrong and somewhat tactless individuals whose contempt for Diana spilled over into their reaction to her death.  Prince Charles is portrayed rather sympathetically by Alex Jennings who seemed to capture the essence that was and is Charles beautifully.<br /><br />Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan should be singled out though for helming the creation of this film.  Frears direction only magnifies the brilliance of Morgan's script that is both accurate (all biopics fail to be completely accurate, but in Hollywood terms this is quite good), witty, funny and engaging as well as educational for it helps the general public understand a little better a woman that not too many fully understand.  I won't deny the fact that, at times, `The Queen' does play out like a `TV Movie' for its production is not as polished as one might expect, but that in the end may be part of its appeal.  The lack of polish helps to keep the focus on the acting, which is miles above those found in `TV Movies'.<br /><br />I am not one who believes Helen Mirren gave the best performance of the year or even of her five fellow nominees but now that I have witnessed her performance I can't say that I am upset with her win either.  She showed true strength and temperance with her delivery and was commanding without being showy.<br /><br />`The Queen' is a movie I am glad to have seen and one that I will most likely see again for it proved to be much better than I had expected and delivered much more than I thought it could.  Is it in my top ten of the year?  No, but it is one of those `honorable mentions' that is worth just about everyone's time.t now that I have witnessed her performance I can't say that I am upset with her win either.

B000WSL5Y0|5.0|When a young Boston girl, Amanda McCready,  is kidnapped, PI's Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) are called in by the child's aunt to investigate sources in the neighborhood that won't talk to the police.    They're reluctant to take the case.  Gennaro doesn't think it will end well--as Kenzie comments in the opening narrative, \\"we handle cases for people who live on the edge--and fall through the cracks.\\"     As they dig into the case, they realize Helene McCready, Amanda's mom, isn't precisely Mother of the Year material.  Amanda is considered the mascot at Helene's favorite bar--but she only goes in there in the daytime because it's far too violent after dark.  Helene is a drug user and occasionally acts as a mule for one of the local dealers.  Little Amanda was probably stolen because Helene and her no-account boyfriend ripped off the local drug dealer.    Enter Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and his partner, Nick Poole (John Ashton).  They're assigned to help Kenzie and Gennaro by Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman). When Bressant learns of the drug deal gone bad, he and Kenzie team up to set things right believing that if they paid back the drug dealer that he'd return little Amanda to her family.     The switch goes awry and Kenzie and Gennaro realize they've been had.  Now they stand on opposite sides of a moral issue and the question posed to them threatens their future together and their individual peace of mind.     Ben Affleck did an amazing job directing this thriller-morality play by Dennis Lehane. For the most part, he was spot on with his timing.  Standouts were younger brother Casey as Kenzie and of course Ed Harris as Bressart (in a reprise of his true believer type role in \\"The Rock\\") and Morgan Freeman as Doyle.  I genuinely believe at least two of the three of these actors should be nominated for an Academy Award for their performances.    \\"Gone\\" was a hard film to watch and it's one that will have you debating the merits of the decision with your family and friends for days to come.  That's the true mark of a really good film--how well it stays with you.  This one's a must for collectors of strong mysteries.

6304508611|5.0|This movie came out 30 or so years ago but it is still just as chilling in many ways.  Consider Carrie's tragic life, the mean girl bullies at her high school, her rude English teacher, her religious fanatic of a mother. This would be enough to destroy anyone.  Carrie, however, possesses telekinetic powers which eventually enable her to wreak the ultimate revenge on those who tormented and humiliated her.  She even ends up killing her own mother and causing their house to collapse on them, killing both.<br />Sissy Spacek has always been an outstanding actress, and this is only one example of how good she is.  You have to feel for Carrie; she has so much against her.  Piper Laurie is over-the-top-wonderful as Margaret White, who finds no joy in her religion but plenty of ways to condemn others, even her own daughter, whom she refers to as a witch because of her powers.  PJ Soles, Nancy Allen, and John Travolta are deliciously nasty as those who wish harm towards Carrie; while Amy Irving plays a teen who feel bad about picking on Carrie and tries to make it up to her.  William Katt sweetly plays Tommy, a kindly boy who agrees to take Carrie to the ill-fated prom at Sue's request.  Betty Buckley is unforgettable, too, as gym teacher Miss Collins, who tries to help Carrie with her self-image but ends up killed along with everyone else when Carrie goes into a trance during her final rage.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|The film is a great film -- but it would not be what it is without this soundtrack. As an editor I think I can say with confidence that the most effective emotional cues in films are in the music track, and this film is filled with very strong emotion. Something in Eddie Vedder resonated with the story, and the synergy benefits the film enormously.<br /><br />Frankly, I've been waiting for Mr. Vedder to explode from all that tightly wrapped passion of his... but I'm extremely glad that instead of spiraling into some awful kind of personal destruction he's able to channel that energy into this kind of artistic effort rather than the who-knows-what insane act of passion he sounds capable of when he performs. This is wonderful.
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|typical that you people will glorify this kind of stuff. yeah, what a great concept, a serial killer who kills \\"bad\\" serial killers. oooooooooh. how NICE is that? one you could have for your VERY OWN, and not YOUR boogeyman, but the boogeyman to scare away all the OTHER boogeymen. oooooh.    while i can say it was entertaining, for laugh value mostly, i can also say that this should come as an insult to your run-of-the-mill, \\"normal\\" type of person. but, shockingly(lol), it doesnt. the reason it should insult, is that ol' DEX here, with his \\"killer\\"(lol)personality, is so horrible at ACTING. trust me, it takes a little bit more than THAT to fool people into thinking youre the everyday JOE. and the characters on-screen buy into his retarded attempt at being CHARMING. wow. let me guess, is it because hes HANDSOME??? yeah, \\"one of us\\", right? give me a break. this show is so hollow (\\"much like dexters emotions\\", ill just bet youre saying), that even I cant see this as being realistic. just another of mankind's fantasies, played out by meager actors, and presented to the vast bunch of retards. you all want to see a real psychopath in action, watch \\"american psycho\\". or better yet, read the book. this comes only slightly close to the realism in your everyday maniac who wears a \\"mask of sanity\\". take it from the real thing, kids. watch your shows, be entertained by them if you want, but know that this is delerious FICTION. your real \\"psychos\\" are a lot more cunning than this. i found this to be an insult. a funny one nonetheless, and not because of how it was presented to ME, but because of how it was presented to YOU.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles \\"White Album\\" remains just as fresh, exciting and fascinating today as it did all those years ago when it was originally released on vinyl. These two CDs give us all the tracks from the two LP set and the digital remastering is also very well done.<br /><br />The first CD starts with the stimulating \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\" As The Beatles sing and play a song about a man's return to the former Soviet Union, the electric guitars work wonders for the musical arrangement. This has always been one of my favorite songs by The Beatles because it is so playful while rocking hard at the same time. \\"Dear Prudence\\" features John Lennon singing flawlessly about his woman; and this song has a fine guitar arrangement as well. Moreover, \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" is another electric number with fantastic singing, guitar, drums and percussion. \\"Ob-La Di, Ob-La-Da\\" showcases how well The Beatles could work together no matter what personal conflicts they have had at the time. Great!<br /><br />\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is easily a highlight of this double album; George Harrison finally did prove his stunning genius with this classic love ballad. The song works so well with the guitars, vocalizing, drums and percussion that \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" remains one of George Harrison's greatest hits ever. \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" doesn't require too much imagination to know what John is singing about; and John doesn't miss a beat on this fine ballad, too. I predict that you'll like \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" very much.<br /><br />\\"Blackbird\\" features Paul McCartney singing soulfully of his woman with a gentle guitar accompaniment in the background; and \\"Birthday\\" gives us The Beatles performing their own rock and roll version of \\"Happy Birthday\\" while throwing in their desire for romance with their women. Listen for some great electric guitar on \\"Birthday,\\" too. \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey\\"\\" has John Lennon singing his best with awesome percussion; and $exy Sadie\\" is a beautiful number John sings about his woman. \\"$exy Sadie\\" allows John to expose some of his innermost feelings, too.<br /><br />\\"Honey Pie\\" has a great piano arrangement; and Paul sings this sweetly as he describes a woman he wants to return to him. \\"Revolution 9,\\" a rather experimental number, gathers strength from the different keys and sound effects in the arrangement.<br /><br />The liner notes have great photos and artwork; and we get the song lyrics, too.<br /><br />The Beatles \\"White Album\\" will always remain one of their greatest works. Beatles fans will always enjoy this two CD set; and I highly recommend this CD set for people who enjoy classic rock and pop.a beautiful number John sings about his woman. \\"$exy Sadie\\" allows John to expose some of his innermost feelings, too.     \\"Honey Pie\\" has a great piano arrangement; and Paul sings this sweetly as he describes a woman he wants to return to him. \\"Revolution 9,\\" a rather experimental number, gathers strength from the different keys and sound effects in the arrangement.

B000UCEJEQ|2.0|I love Annie Lennox. I have been a fan of her music since her days with The Eurythmics. I also love her work as a solo artist...until now. I have been looking forward to hearing her new album SONGS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. I heard samples of her new album in the store and liked what I heard. Unfortunately when I listened to the album in its entirety I was left unimpressed. Personally I think Annie's strength lies in her ballads like \\"Dark Road\\", \\"Lost\\", and \\"Coloured Bedspread\\". Her soulful voice gives those songs an emotional depth without verging on the treacly territory of Celine Dion. Her uptempo tempo songs like \\"Womankind\\" and worse yet \\"Sing\\" are dreadful, especially \\"Sing\\". I didn't like the melodies or Annie's vocals which tended to be loud and bombastic. My personal favorite song on the entire cd is the lovely \\"Coloured Bedspread\\". It is a beautiful ballad. Too bad I can't say the same for most of the album. SONGS OF MASS DESTRUCTION was a big letdown for me.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|Interscope Records has released three variations of soundtrack albums from the film - a standard edition and two deluxe editions. The standard edition contains 16 tracks from the film soundtrack. The first version of the deluxe edition features 31 tracks - all of the vocal performances and one of the three instrumental tracks. This 31-track version is available solely at the Best Buy retail chain and in a digital version via iTunes. A second version of the deluxe edition is available at other retail outlets. The second version differs from the 31-track version in that it omits two tracks: \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\".  The total time for these two missing tracks is 5 minutes.     If you can get the 31-track version without a lot of hassle, then do so.  But see no point in buying the 16-song single CD version when for a few dollars more you get more than 54 minutes of extra music.      The 29-track version is excellent and worth the money.  Virtually every song is done in a manner very different from the original by the Beatles and yet it is very enjoyable and tasteful.  Great, innovative cover versions, an amazing feat.    A final comment.  Interscope Records is to be disdained for releasing 2 different Deluxe versions and causing both buyers and sellers a lot of needless decision making problems.  Obviously, Best Buys made some marketing arrangement with Interscope Records but created a lot of angst for buyers.

B000UFAURI|2.0|This is a so-so album. I don't think they've put out a great album since \\"There is nothing left to Lose\\", although \\"One By One\\" has some incredible moments. Each of their first three albums had songs that were individually original and unique. \\"One by One\\", although enjoyable, gave me the feeling they were slipping just a bit, and then \\"In Your Honor\\" came out, and the first disc of heavy songs all sounded the same. Buried lyrics, searing guitar riffs, and repetitive choruses. Nothing stood out. It seemed like \\"Butter spread upon too much bread\\" (quoting J.R.R. Tolkien). I feel the same way about many of the songs on this new album; the rocking songs just kind of sit there and do nothing. Plus they are mixing the acoustical side B of \\"In your Honor\\" with the second half of this album, and it leaves an imperfect, unbalanced effort between fast and slow. \\"Summer's End\\" is my favorite track, for it at least has a groove, an in-between, which lacks on other songs that don't have anything to sick your teeth into. Speaking of sinking teeth, Dave lacks the hunger he used to have. It all sounds much too comfortable. Standard rock, at best. Side of fries. Check, please.

Christopher is autistic and describes what it's like for him to experience the overwhelming sensory input of the world around him.<br /><br />The story kept me interested and I was fascinated by what it was like for Christopher to navigate new places by himself.  I hate to travel and I could relate to how overwhelmed he was by all of the signage and sounds in the subway.<br /><br />I thought this was very interesting and well done.  I thought the characters were very realistic as was the dialogue.  I enjoyed the maps, drawings and diagrams.  Overall I thought it was clever and well done but I didn't love it.
0316010669|5.0|I was riveted from start to finish. Gladwell reveals how we can become superior decision makers, in our homes, our workplaces, and in our daily lives. It's remarkable to realize that this book represents the life work of many brilliant researchers, most of whom we would never know except for this book. Gladwell has taken decades and volumes of highly technical research and made these concepts accessible to the average reader and anyone can see almost instantly how it applies to everyday situations we all encounter.  I also recommend [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]].

B0000027RL|5.0|This album was the first to separate me from listening to my brother's music to listening to my own.  Although I didn't necessarily 'discover' it on my own (a friend said hey listen to this - a new appreciation for music and words was born) who really discovers these kinds of things.  Maybe they find you when you need them or when you're ready.    A lot of people say that the more recent PJ albums aren't as good as 'Ten' and they can't really get into them.  I would disagree.  My opinion is that they are just different.  People change and I would guess that this is what is reflected in the change over the years of PJ.  Maybe it is the people that say PJ isn't the same that are the ones that haven't changed and grown.  Either way this album to me has raw emotion and the power and thirst that goes with it.
1591840562|5.0|As a student trying to learn how to build, manage, and promote a band successfully, I surprisingly found a lot of useful information in this book. The subtitle \\"The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything\\" speaks volumes of truth about what the reader will get. This book was recommended to me by the head of the business department at my college, so I trusted his word and gave it a shot...I was not disappointed.    Each chapter starts with a \\"gist,\\" which is a summary as well as \\"Great Ideas for Starting Things.\\" It gives a quick synopsis of what's going to be covered in the chapter and what you should be looking forward to. Every chapter's title starts with \\"The Art of...\\" which tells the reader that each chapter has tips and tricks on how to become more knowledgeable and proficient at that specific art.    Several of Kawasaki's strategies have been implemented in the writing of the book, and they helped immensely.  By using stories and explaining the topics in laymen's terms, the book is a fast and easy read that teaches topics that benefit everyone from the beginning entrepreneur to the seasoned businessman.     In regards to the application of this book to my studies, I've been able to utilize several of the strategies. From knowing when to use guerilla tactics to how to properly pitch a plan to future investors to implementing differentiation, this book does a great job of sharing knowledge that could usually only be obtained by experience. My favorite part of the book came at the end, \\"The Art of Being a Mensch.\\" Reading this section says a lot about the author's integrity and what it really takes to be successful in the world of business, as opposed to just getting by.    The Art of Starting (Chapter 1) gave many great insights to why you should be doing what you're doing. The main reason you should be doing what you're doing is to make a difference or to make meaning. If you're doing something for the money or for the fame and glory, quit now. The other main thing I got out of this chapter is that you should set your sights high because anything is possible.    The Art of Positioning (Chapter 2) taught me that in order to succeed, I need to find a niche to fit into where people actually need the product I'm selling. I need to differentiate myself away from the norm so that people realize that the product I'm selling is a necessity.     The Art of Pitching (Chapter 3) showed me that you need to know your product front to back and be able to talk about it with passion and excitement. If you don't know how to pitch your product, no one is going to know about it.    The Art of Writing a Business Plan (Chapter 4) told me that in order to get where I'm going, I have to have a plan to do so. As well, I need to have backup plans in case certain things fall through.     The Art of Bootstrapping (Chapter 5) taught me that I need to focus on function not form, in other words, that as long as I can get by, it doesn't need to be pretty. If I can save money by doing a little bit more work, I need to do so. I need to have the right people in the right places, which lead into the next chapter.     The Art of Recruiting (Chapter 6) showed me that I need to learn to delegate. By getting other people who are just as passionate as I am, I'm building a team that will succeed. As long as I'm still trying to make meaning, it doesn't matter if I'm in charge or if I'm the guy on the bottom.    The Art of Raising Capital (Chapter 7) taught me that I need to tell the truth to my investors and to myself if I want to succeed. If there is a problem or something is wrong, I need to be sure to put it out in front of everyone so we can work as a team to fix it.     The Art of Partnering (Chapter 8) told me that I need to form alliances with people who can help me. By networking, I will make it much easier to succeed by getting people around me who want to make meaning. As well, I need to do things just for the sake of being a good person, for the \\"karmic scoreboard.\\"    The Art of Branding (Chapter 9) showed me that I really need to differentiate my product so people need it. As well, I need to be finding evangelists, people who realize the greatness of my product and who are willing to spread the word about it. In my case, it would be creating a street team to support and \\"evangelize\\" our music.    The Art of Rainmaking (Chapter 10) taught me that I need to let people try my product first before they buy it. I should have tracks on my website that allow people to listen to the music or even download a track before they buy it. As well, it taught me that I need to learn from rejection. You can't always get it perfect, so learn from your mistakes and become better at what you're doing.    The Art of Being a Mensch (Chapter 11) showed me that no matter what happens, it is most important to be a good person and to work to better the world. I should be trying to help people through my music, which I believe I am doing.     All in all, I was very pleased with \\"The Art of the Start\\" and would recommend it to \\"anyone starting anything.\\" From cover to cover, it's real and provides the essentials that are necessary to succeed. Two thumbs up...    ---Justin Manion  [...]

0307346617|5.0|This book is down right amazing. There's a lot of praise I could heap onto Mr. Brook's novel, but I'll try and give a unbiased review. The book takes place after the the title mentioned \\"World War Z\\". In the aftermath of this most devastating of events, the author travels the world getting stories from the many survivors (the big wigs and the small). I've read tons of zombie novels and I have to say this is one of the best zombie novels I've ever read. It ranks up there with Dying to Live and Day by Day Armegedon. This a must read for the zombie aficionado.
B00005JPTA|1.0|This movie was very disappointing. The resuscitation scenes initially are completely unrealistic - how many doctors wipe blood-stained hands across their brows? Who doesn't get a blood transfusion, an i.v. or at least fluids going? Naomi Watts' character is one-dimensional and striking for her stupidity. Someone with her background (father who would have escaped the USSR in the Cold War; a canny Russian uncle) would have grown up on stories of the KGB, the Russian mafia and be more aware of the duplicitous natures of some of her fellow countrymen. In fact, many 'exiles' worked as spies and reported on their communities in exile during the Cold War. I was utterly incredulous. The mother was equally stupid. Naomi's character displays neither particular intelligence nor bravery and the ending is absolute trash - one cannot just take a baby home from work to look after it!!! What about the fostering process and the mother's identity? Why Viggo's character is working as he does and for whom is also a complete mystery. Kiril's breakdown with the baby in his lap is also utterly unbelievable and not to type.  The fight sequence in the baths is well-choreographed, but once again, why would a severely wounded man crawl over the top of an undead assailant? The cut throat of the epileptic and retarded nephew of Azim is like something out of Hammer Horror and would have been better off in Kill Bill, where at least our howls of laughter would have been appropriate.   A complete waste of time and particularly unintelligent. A real disappointment.   The stuff about the tattoos was interesting, but you can read about that elsewhere.....
B000AXRTPQ|1.0|I'm a working mother who read this during the flights to and from a business trip.  It is, quite possibly, the worst book I have ever read.  Normally I give a book 100 pages to draw me in and it usually does, at least to some level.  This is the first one I read where, 100 pages in, it still had no semblance of a real plot or any development of its main characters.  However, being stuck on a 3-hour flight and having a morbid curiosity similar to what you might feel passing a car wreck, I read on.    First, Kate Reddy -- supposedly 35 at the beginning of the 21st century --is SO 80s feministe.  I'm 33, and frankly, the whole guilt thing about working, having your children in day care, and not being able to bake homemade cookies for school is so passe.  I love work, I love my kid, the day care I use is fabulous, and anyone who thinks I'm going to be up at 2am banging on store-bought pastries to make them look homemade is on crack.  It's called LIFE, people.  You make your decisions, and you live with them.      Second, Kate, despite being a big-shot fund manager, apparently has no self respect.  Any 30-something who graduated from a top college today knows her self-worth, and knows that there are plenty of firms and organizations desperate to get top female talent to join their ranks (at least in America).  Seriously, if my boss tried to tell me I wouldn't be getting a raise/bonus and then added EXTRA work on -- when I was in a position to not even be dependent on the job financially -- I'd have a new job lined up somewhere else in about a month.  Kate seems to think this treatment is just fine.  Similarly, when the men at her firm pull a Clarence Thomas-like stunt on a younger female colleague, Kate sighs and offers a \\"boys will be boys\\" excuse to the other woman and predicts that it would be the woman, not the male employees, who would suffer if she tried to report it.  What planet is she on?  Can someone please name me a major company that would not IMMEDIATELY fire a man (who is, incidentally, also a known cokehead) who created pornographic images of a (minority) female collegue on an office computer and circulated them to all of the other male workers?  I can see this happening in some factory to powerless women who have no way out, but this scenario really seems absurd to me in a high-profile international private company.    Finally, Kate Reddy is a disaster of a parent and it's obvious why she can't stand her kids -- they are insufferable brats.  Being a working mother and having to get outside help to care for your children does not give you carte blanche to abandon your parenting duties and not help them to understand things like discipline, respect, and making good choices.  This goes back to the whole \\"guilt\\" thing, which seems to be an excuse for Kate to not actually put any work into being an active parent.  Maybe Kate should stop worrying about what the stay-at-home mom across the street thinks of her and use that time to read Dr. Spock.  Maybe she needs to take a break from her bra-burning, man-hating rants and and actually have a 21st-century marriage where men (gasp!) communicate with their wives and do housework and help with kids and are not completely incompetent.  In any event, Kate Reddy is my worst nightmare for a neighbor/friend/colleague and I felt not a single ounce of sympathy for her through the entire novel.    I've spent more time than I should commenting on this book, so I won't get into the stylistic downfalls, like Pearson's attempt to copy Helen Fielding's tone which results in redundant gimmicks like the \\"To Do List\\" at the end of each chapter.  Unless your only other option is to fling yourself out of a window, don't read this book (and even then it's really a toss-up).
B000W7M1F8|5.0|As a huge Britney fan, I waited a very long time for her to release a new CD, and I have to say that the wait was well worth it. \\"Blackout\\" is just as good as any other record by Britney (even when I do think that there will never be a CD as good as \\"In the Zone\\").    Every single song has a great beat and amazing lyrics, and I couldn't find a single song in the whole cd that I disliked. All of them are simply great! I specially liked the songs \\"Piece of Me\\", \\"Radar\\", \\"Break the Ice\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\".    I also noticed, while listening to it, that \\"Blackout\\" is pretty much about 'going back like nothing happened'; Britney is trying to show us with this record that she is the same amazing performer she was a few years ago even with all the scandal that has been going around her lately, and that parenthood doesn't stop her from still being sexy and sing about anything she wants to, just like she says in the song \\"Piece of Me\\": 'I can't see no harm in working and being a mama'    So... what else can I say? I'd just like to recommend this CD to everyone so that you all go and buy it, and (as Britney says herself in the first song of the CD): \\"It's Britney, b!tch\\"
B000WSHF4E|5.0|Following up 1998's Elizabeth, which documented the virgin queen's early years and rise to power, director Shekar Kapur delivers The Golden Age, an exploration of her character. While Elizabeth (Blanchett) is busy deflecting unsuitable suitors and falling for the dashing Walter Raleigh (Owen), imprisoned cousin Mary (Morton) plans her assassination with the backing of Spain's devout Catholic king, Phillip II (Jordi Molla), who has promised to rid England of Protestants. The first half of the film has a lot going for it: lavish, detailed and not as stiff as your usual period dramas, The Golden Age allows the love story to take precedence and the subtle wooing between the Queen and Raleigh boasts a few cracking put-downs. Blanchett, arguably the best actress of her generation, knows how to play Elizabeth and has fun with the character, while Owen et al just about match her. It's obvious that Kapur wanted to devote more time to the Spanish invasion, but time or money trimmed the battle back to such an extent that the grandiose Armada lacks any real significance - both visually and story-wise. A story of two halves, The Golden Age works better as a love story than a political conspiracy.
1416523359|3.0|I nearly put down and gave up on this novel several times.Any other author, I would have but I slogged through this one.If King and his editor cut out about 1/3 of the pages,you would have the makings of a typical great King story.Even though the story was a good one and at times enjoyable,\\"Lisey's Story\\" was a burden to read.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|De Niro's first outing in the director's seat since his 1993 debut A Bronx Tale is an in-depth look at the birth of the CIA as seen through the eyes of one of its first agents, Edward Wilson (Damon). Wilson, recruited by the OSS - a counter-intelligence unit - during WWII, is approached by General Bill Sullivan (De Niro) to help build an organization to be the \\"eyes and ears, not the heart and soul\\" of the United States. Wilson throws himself into his work, but Cold War paranoia takes over and, distrusting all around him, his job has dire consequences for his marriage (to Jolie), his family and his sanity. The Good Shepherd is a nuts-and-bolts, behind-the-scenes peek at a spy genre - the flipside to The Bourne Identity, the paperwork behind a James Bond mission, a cloak-and-dagger film without the dagger. Pretty good I would say.
B000U7169M|4.0|Hilary Swank is an ordained minister who has turned her back on religion.  She now spends her time disproving religious phenomenon.  Now she has been called to the small town of Haven where supposedly a young girl turned the local river into blood.  But no sooner does the investigation begin than frogs fall from the sky.  Soon more plagues manifest in the small community.  Many of the townsfolk feel it is the work of a young girl living in the swamp and that she should be eliminated.  But what is really going on and what role is Swank supposed to play?  Another minster who Swank is acquainted with thinks he may have the answer.    As the film moves along it does a very good job of playing The Old Testament and keeping things on track.  But later when the new prophesy is brought in it gets a little muddled.  I found it interesting that it had to be stressed that the prophesy was older than Christ when they are reliving events far older.  Is magic at work?  Is it God?  The Devil?  Is faith required?  Overall a pretty good movie although it gets a little muddled at the end as explanations are offered too quickly to sink in as the action escalates.  Could have been a little better but still pretty good.  Check it out.

B000E5N62U|5.0|As with all Fagen/Steely Dan albums, I have listened to this CD countless times--and as a keyboard player painstakingly figured out all the chords. And like all true Fagen/Steely Dan fans, with the cuts that I wasn't all that fond of initially--I FOUND a way to like them all, because I KNOW that there has to be something really good about each song, or else it wouldn't be on the album. For me, very very few recording artists have earned that status.

0525950079|5.0|I just finished reading World Without End, and I have to give the book 5 stars because I fell so sad that the journey is over.  The book is over a thousand pages but it flew by!  Yes, this is different than The Pillars of the Earth, but Follett's voice is strong throughout and that is what unifies the books.  I think people who haven't read Pillars would like this very much.  As a matter of fact, I would suggest that new readers read World first, then go to Pillars like a prequel.  That way, talk of Tom Builder and the cathedral in World would tantalize you, making you wonder what went into building it over two hundred years before World began.  When you read the politics behind building a \\"mere\\" bridge in World, it will certainly make you run for Pillars (another thousand page masterwork of fiction.)<br /><br />I'm sad to see World go because of all of the wonderfully drawn characters.  I also like the fact you follow many strong women in this story.  All of the subplots are resolved, although there are quite a few surprises along the way.  Love, death, the plague, politics, war, and sex, all covered here.  It may sound like a soap opera, but it's much more complex and textured than that.  This book has many layers, and it succeeds on every level.<br /><br />I've read other reviews that say the people don't talk in \\"the vernacular.\\"  What a ridiculous thing to say.  Are we supposed to be reading this book on parchment in Latin?  How do these supposed critics know how anyone spoke back then?  Of course the dialogue has to be written for modern audiences because that's who's reading this book!  And then there are objections to the vulgarity.  Well, folks, I hate to break it to you, but people had \\"intimate relations\\" back then, so get used to it.  While I do admit there is quite a lot of \\"shagging\\" going on, it all relates to plot so it shouldn't bother anyone who is into the story.  And there is an awful lot of violence, too, but considering we're dealing with war and vengeance, it's understandable.  Follett writes these scenes with economy and grace, mixed in with some blunt writing that adds texture.<br /><br />So please don't let the length fool you.  I finished it in a week, it was that good.  I can only hope Follett has one more of these in him.  I really want to see how Kingsbridge rises or falls in the 1500s.'s understandable.

B0001I55SS|4.0|I can see where Disney was going with this movie. They wanted something with the feel of \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" and the look of Forbidden Planet. Unfortunately they didn't quite get there, but the result is still a lot of fun. Yeah, there are the silly bits like B.O.B. with his cornpone accent, the bizarre 2001-wannabe ending, and the very unlikely physics. On the other hand, the design and execution of the Cygnus (and the Palomino, too, in a less flashy way) are really stunning. The visual effects in general are beautiful, especially considering the technology of the time. The musical score is also very good, and the acting is really pretty solid, let down by corny dialog. If only the plot had been up to the same standards.
0783219695|5.0|this movie is a really good movie that does not get old.  i still enjoy watching it as i did when it was in theaters
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are back in full force with \\"Magic,\\" an album in the same vein as \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"The River.\\" This album has many different messages, and can be interpreted either personally or politically. The stories and style of \\"Magic\\" remind me of Bruce's older work--it has a very different sound from his last collaboration with the E Street Band, \\"The Rising.\\" I would highly recommend this album to all Bruce fans--and to rock and pop fans in general. The only complaints I have are that Bruce's voice and lyrics are somewhat hard to hear (nothing that can't be fixed by reading them in the booklet or online)! You get more out of it if you make the extra bit of effort to know exactly what he's saying! Highly recommended!!!
B0002V7OI8|5.0|this is a all time favorite.  i just love morgan freeman in anything that he does.  but there are a lot of good actors in this and it to me is more realistic for if this were to happen in real life

0446528056|2.0|The thing that made me not want to read the book right off the bat was the fact that he gives away the ending in the prologue. The plot was ok, but it was just too predictable. Nicholas Sparks becomes very monotonous in his writing at times, which makes reading some of his books tedious. Honestly, this book made me mad with the way it ended. Not one of his best.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|this is one of the funniest classics that i know of.  one of the family's favorites!!!
B000NQRV4O|5.0|About 20 minutes into this movie, I shut it off. I was getting a bit bored thinking I was watching another sappy and tired relationship story. Then I decided to go back to it a few days later and was blown away.     This movie is very complex on many levels and I really had no idea where it was heading. Even the ending was a shock. It is not by any means your typical Hollyood film.    The movie is a bit slow, but you are rewarded with an intense story, amazing acting, and a thought provoking ending.     Oh, and if you like Natlie Portman she has some very sexy/ erotic scenes in this film. va va vooom !     PQ was excellent.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|this is one of the funniest movies that i own.  a deffinate must have if you love to laugh and it is also fun for the family
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This film is something completely different than what you have seen.  First the setting is about cooking.  How many movies have you seen about cooks and cooking?  Nil!  The only predictable thing about the movie was that it would have a happy end (You hope!)but you can't be sure since toward the ending there are so many directions the film can go.  I appreciated the originality and the subject matter as well as the whole film taken together.
0374105235|5.0|i came across this book in the airport, i picked it because it was the first thing i saw. not expecting anything, this book surprised me in so many ways. my heart lightened and sank as the author's life story unfolded. i have tears down my cheek and the passenger next to me was, well, scared. i finished the book before my plane landed. it makes me rethink the worth of life and how good we have it, and more importantly, please say no to children soldiers, and to war, for that matters.

0805083367|5.0|My baby absolutely lights up with these pictures and the cadence of the story. I probably in retrospect would have bought the board book because she wants to eat the pages. (7 month old). Other than that she loves the book and the pictures.
0316067598|4.0|Great book, but, as a Marine Corps infantry officer and combat veteran, some things concern me about the account.  Specifically:      1.  How do three goatherds and a gaggle of goats with bells around their necks get to within 4 feet of a 4 man SEAL team without being noticed?    2.  Why did they let the goatherds go?  Why not abort the mission and take them with them to the extraction point and then let them go after the helicopters had arrived?  Why not abort the mission and bind their hands and feet and immediately depart for the extraction point?    3.  Why did they let them go and then stick around?  An odd decsion given that they knew their position and mission was compromised.    4.  Why debate about killing them?  Difficult to imagine that there would be a \\"vote\\" in the the military - especially a highly disciplined SEAL team - dropped behind enemy lines -- specifically designated and trained to avoid such encounters.  However, should such a contingency occur, SEALS are specifically trained to deal with them.  A vote?    5.  Axelson receives a \\"mortal head wound,\\" but puts a bandage on himself and then passes a message to stay alive and tell his wife he loves her?  Ever seen a mortal head wound?    6.  How come the Commander was frantically asking a Petty Officer what they should do in a combat situation?  That is his role and responsibility.  I understand the roles of the various SEAL team members, but an experienced SEAL Commander asking for advice during combat?    7.  Why did Cmdr Murphy go into the clearing to use his cell telephone to call for help when Luttrell later uses his EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) to indicate his position to air craft?  Every SEAL carries and EPIRB and all they have to do is hit the button and the whole military world knows they are in trouble and comes running.  Four SEALS activating their EPIRBs would have brought every aircraft and weapon within 1000 miles into their area of operation.  And the satellite based EPIRB reception is FAR superior to any cell telephone.     8.  Cmdr Murphy makes his call, gets shot through the back so that Luttrell can see his \\"chest blow out,\\" but then picks up his weapon and telephone and comes back to fight?  Ever seen a man get shot in the back?    9.  Why did he wait so long to use the cell telephone?  I understand that he wanted to avoid to detection.  After being discovered, that was no longer a concern.    9.  Why does Luttrell, the lone survivor now hiding in a rock crevasse and having successfully evaded the search party for more than 8 hours, shoot three weapons carrying men from more than 150 yards away and across a valley?  They had not seen him and seem to pose no immediate threat.  Yet he shoots all three of them at the risk of compromising his position and bringing more than 60 more to bear on his position that he knows are out there looking for him.  SEALs are trained at covert reconnaissance.  The last thing they want to do is reveal their position.  They are specialized in escape and evasion.  Those three shots were noisy and very risky.    I am sure there are answers to these concerns, but it is an unusual and incomplete account for those wishing to understand the details of this specific combat action and not just the story of these heroic actions by an heroic SEAL team.    Nevertheless, an exceptional story of heroism and sacrifice.

B000VECAEO|4.0|The first time I ever really sat down and watched an entire \\"Seinfeld\\" episode was when they originally aired the final 2 episodes of the last season. I became interested, based off what I saw in the series finale, after all those years of ignoring the show. I've been watching re-runs and buying the DVDs ever since like clockwork (every November and May for the past 3 years). I sat here thinking to myself, \\"Isn't it almost November? I wonder if the new 'Seinfeld' DVD is being advertised yet?\\" So I checked Amazon.com and there it was, coming out next week! This show, like \\"Married with Children\\" was so innovative that it spawned many copy-cat shows that ended up looking inferior and unwatchable (Friends) to their predecessors. The ending starts at the beginning, basically stating that as shallow and misguided the characters were, the one thing they were looking for in other people was amongst themselves the whole time. They were meant to be together, and ended up that way, in jail. Hope I didn't ruin the ending. Jerry even mentioned it to Elaine in the episode where he released all his emotions: \\"Maybe everything we've been looking for has been between us the whole time\\". And Elaine reitterated that statement. Kramer may have said the exact same thing in an earlier episode, in \\"The Fix Up\\". The one thing I'm going to need closure on is to see the origin of that clip where Elaine has a dream that the 4 of them are all in the same bed. I've watched every episode and every deleted scene and I can't find it, except in that one clip show where it originated. What show is that from? If they don't reveal that in this last DVD set, I'll go ballistic!
0316067598|1.0|couldn't make it past the first few chapters where he states that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction....really?  We've been there for years and haven't found anything yet.  I know they need to fill up the pages with a lot of introductory background but please leave off the chest pounding Rush Limbaugh/GW Bush are right about everything rants.  Also the rants about the rules of engagement are boring.  Sorry dude but you cant shoot everybody in the country whenever you feel like it.  I'm sure sometimes it puts you at risk but isn't that something you knew when joining our volunteer military?  Check the Pasadena Salvation Army bookshelf, you can buy my copy cheap.

B0000019HU|5.0|Slint's 1989 debut album [[ASIN:B0000019KN Tweez]] had been mainly generic thrash metal with a few quieter moments, but none that hinted they were to move to such a new plane as they did on \\"Spiderland\\". Indeed, as has been said many times before, they did something that had almost never been done.<br /><br />The amazing thing about \\"Spiderland\\" is the way in which Brian McMahan and David Pajo are able to make their guitars sound so soft and then turn into a \\"loudness\\" (that's really the wrong word) without the slightest trace of pomp as dominated on the short songs of [[ASIN:B0000019KN Tweez]]. On the opening track \\"Breadcrumb Trail\\" the band sets the tone with a simple hybrid of folk guitars and almost punkish drums before the electric guitar enters to create an effect that hits one in the heart much more deeply than pompous metal or stadium rock ever could. \\"Nosferatu Man\\", though danceable, is the closest of \\"Spiderland\\"'s tracks to [[ASIN:B0000019KN Tweez]] and does not have the same impact, but with \\"Don Aman\\" Slint move further-ot than ever before. In the process they create a song in which every note seems to have the emotional effect of an entire song on most other albums. The guitar might seem like Joni Mitchell's [[ASIN:B000002GYC \\"Coyote\\"]], but it is so much sharper and slower. \\"Crystalline\\" might be a very apt word given the way in which each note is made for maximum impact.<br /><br />\\"Washer\\", the longets track on the record, does not have quite the impact of \\"Don, Aman\\", but the stark instrumentation on most of the track is not only tender and beautiful but truly passionate. \\"For Dinner\\" is a surprisingly light instrumental piece that does not have the remarkable qualities of \\"Spiderland\\"'s best material, but the closer \\"Good Morning Captain\\" is really explosive, especially at the end when McMahan screams \\"I miss you\\" with the kind of helplessness that I myself often feel when in despair.<br /><br />Even if the second and fifth tracks are not up the remarkable standard of innovation and passion of the rest of the album, it is impossible not to give \\"Spiderland\\" the full five stars. A record of such genuine passion is a true treat not to be missed, and its influence on the post-rock generation through showing how music could be made more emotional than ever before is further reason to elevate \\"Spiderland\\" to a high status.innovation and passion of the rest of the album, it is impossible not to give \\"Spiderland\\" the full five stars.

B000GUJHIA|4.0|incredible amount of information and depth is presented in this book. however, some portions are extremely dry and monotonous especially when judt deals with politics, which is naturally a large portion of this book. nevertheless, it is an essential piece of literature for anyone who wants to learn more about europe

B000NDIAWY|4.0|I really like this album. I've been listening to it at work for a couple of weeks, now. I love the care-worn quality of Brandi Carlile's voice; that edge in her voice effectively portrays the emotion in these songs and, dare I say it, makes the little bit of yodeling likeable. I love T. Bone Burnett's production of these songs. I don't normally go for country (especially pop-country) and this album falls somewhere between rock-folk-blues-country - sort of like the [early] Eagles, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, John Hiatt.

033041836X|1.0|But Alice (in her own words) was not triumphant. After being raped as a reasonably well-raised 18-year-old college freshman, Alice spent years as a heroine addict, 10 years with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, and many, many years unwell.  Not a happy life!  Not even now does she seem to be well.

B000ROALCG|5.0|Marc Anthony's Album El Cantante is good when you see it as it is;; the soundrack of a movie in which he was playing and singing the part as Hector Lavoe. Of course that if you compare the songs on the soundrack with the originals songs Marc's performance will not be good. But what are we really talking about here: about his singing skills and talents as a salsa singer, which are SUPERB! or about the imitiation of Hector Lavoe?  Talking of both he really hit the mark!!

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I have been listening to Springsteen since the mid 1980's when Born in the USA burst into just about every home in the western world.  I was 18 years old and fell in love with the Boss. I wasn't American, but what the hell, the songs struck a chord. They were real man, and while the beat was up, those poor suckers were down! It might have been America he was singing about but it could just as well have been the town I lived in... Street Nowhere in Australia or anywhere else where the Nobody Man struggles to make it.    I delved back into Bruce's catalogue and fell in love with Greetings From Asbury Park, The Wild & The Innocent.., The River, Darkness.., Nebraska. Most of the stories were simple reality... life is tough, and often unfair, but man the music and the poetry of Bruce's writing gave hope and made me feel...  Feel with a capital F... more then just about any other singer then and now.    I married, had kids and sort of lost track of the Boss. Now and then I would listen to my favorite Springsteen tracks but in truth I listened less and less to Bruce's newer works. In fact I thought one of the great singer/songwriter/poets of the 20th century had maybe lost touch, or maybe I had lost touch with him?    I WAS WRONG!!!    This is simply the best rock album this year and maybe for the last several years. It brings back the glory of his early works, and the E Street Band sounds great. At 58 years of age it was unexpected, almost unimaginable. A gift to everybody that loves rock and roll and believes it can tell stories that should be told and makes you feel so damn sad while making you feel so damn good.     From the out and out rocker of Radio Nowhere, it grabs you and just keeps hold. Girls in Their Summer Clothes, I'll Work For Your Love and Long Walk Home would make the price of the album worthwhile by themselves, however the rest of the album is great as well. Long Walk Home is seminal Springsteen and for mine the best song this year.    Bruce has always been able to put the listener in the world of his characters, and does so with passion and power in this great album, reminding us all that when a poet of his quality is supported by one of the best bands (EVER!!!) it is simply MAGIC. The album I think the world wanted (I know I did!) back in 1987 has finally arrived... it was a hell of a long wait, but it was worth it.     When the book is closed on the Springsteen career this album will stand with Greetings From Asbury Park, Born To Run, Nebraska  and ... USA as his best work... and his best is Rock Hall of Fame for sure.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|This is Springsteen coming full circle.  I've been waiting and hoping for that to happen and this is the CD.  As others have noted you hear echoes from past Springsteen CD's on Magic.  You literally hear the history of the songwriter in these songs.  There are no tangents, no explorations, no experiments in this CD; this is just Springsteen in total.  This is the CD where the entire past of the artist is reassembled into current, modern music.  For a Springsteen fan this is amazing.    The only down side to this CD is a big one though.  The recording quality is sub par; it lacks clarity and definition.  The sound is much too muddled and muddy.  Had this been a cleaner, less compressed recording with more separation it would have been amazing, truly on par with Born to Run.  The music and the musicians and arrangements where there, but the production values were not.      Still it's a joy to listen too.  And like the song Radio Nowhere, this CD makes you realize how sterile and hopeless and uncommitted all the other top 40, pop and rock music out there is these days.
B000002UUX|3.0|I had a friend who was a big Megadeth fan, or so he claimed (I never actually seen him listening to his Megadeth collection- only seen the bands CDs always sitting on the shelf).    People keep telling me Megadeth can compare to Metallica in terms of heavy guitar riffs and songwriting, but unfortunately, that's not really true.      While Rust In Peace is still a pretty fine album in its own right with a few memorable tunes along the way, it doesn't have the same kind of brutal heaviness or the sheer, overwhelming rock power and energy that Metallica had in abundance on those four 80's albums.  It feels more like a band TRYING to be like Metallica but falling slightly short.    Some of the guitar soloing is really spectacular though.  The lyrics are pretty good in places as well.  The guitar riffs and vocal melodies however, sound like they're recycled and watered down compared to the mighty speed/thrash metal kings, Metallica.      The first two songs on the album are really wonderful though, along with a few other tracks.  Still, you'd be better off sticking with Metallica to find out who the real leaders of heavy metal were.  No, Megadeth won't be remembered the same way Metallica was, sort of like how Creed won't be remembered the way Pearl Jam will.  We won't be remembering inferior copycats in the long run.      While Megadeth is definitely an influence on the thrash metal scene, it doesn't change the fact that Metallica's early style of thrash metal is immediately more noticeable and definitely heavier without the commercial edge.  Therefore, Metallica is easily more influential and original compared to Megadeth.
1592332803|5.0|This book is amazing.  I just received it two weeks ago and have used three of the recipes already.  I made the bran muffins with raisins, oat bran muffins filled with jam, and peanut butter cookies.  All were perfect and indistinguishable from \\"conventional\\" baked goods.  There's a great balance of classic old favorites and new, unfamiliar recipes.  All of the ingredients are easy to find (not always the case in other vegan books).  I am going to get a ton of use out of this book.  I would, literally, make every recipe that appears in the book.  I highly recommend it.
1423313550|4.0|\\"Triple\\" has all the Ken Follett hallmarks of great plot and great excitement, also with the usual not-so-great kinky sex scenes I could do without. But I listened to this on CD and the narrator does the worst accents I've ever heard. The hero, Nat Dickstein, is supposed to be a Cockney, but his accent sometimes sounds southern U.S. and sometimes New York thug, sometimes other things but never Cockney. Even Dick Van Dyke did it better in Mary Poppins, and that was pretty bad. Lucky the book is so riveting, or I wouldn't have been able to sit throught the whole thing.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This is brilliantly accomplished by all parties involved. The fictional parts are subtle, the documentary moments are woven into the movie expertly. Acting, writing, direction, photography...kudos to all. Former Princess Diana dies tragically, the British royal family underestimates how fondly the world had accepted her, and the resulting political and personal stress is frustrating to everyone concerned. Compromise, hypocrisy, generational clashes and the crudities and cruelties of our current culture are all touched upon by superb actors.
B000000993|2.0|Let me admit right now- this band isn't my thing.    The opening song called \\"Intolerance\\" features a loud, grungy guitar riff to open the song.  I can tolerate it.  I understand it was somewhat original back in the day (even though the idea of opening an album with a loud, heavy grunge rocker has been beaten in the mud in todays world).    Many of the guitar riffs sound like they're recycled from old Black Sabbath records and songs such as \\"Sweet Leaf\\".  The looping guitar riff from that song finds it way on numerous occasions on this album somewhere, and I simply won't tolerate that.    The lead singer has an annoyingly overbearing \\"nervous\\" angry sound to his voice that I have trouble accepting as good.  All the vocal melodies sound the same.  It's like falling in a big pot of grunge riffs and vocals and having a big spoon come down and stir you around and around for over an hour.  That's my experience with this album.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|This album is fantastic. It is a new sound, a real sound. As usual, the Cult have produced a progressive album that will enevitably be copied and emulated by other bands (this is the fifth of their 8 albums that have pioneered a new way/sound/standard in modern music - this time i feel they due to get the recognition they deserve). This album reminds and shines the fact that there is no replacement for truly crafted songwriter-musican. A room full of producers and recording specalists for 9 months is no replacement for real craftsmen who can lay down such quality tracks in 1 & half months, start to finnish, brilliant songs, brilliant music. This is an album well worth listening to. A++++
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Anyone that criticizes this album is not a Megadeth fan.. I admit that I am very biased when it comes to Megadeth and Dave Mustaine...they are the reason that i started playing guitar and they still remain my favorite band...and let's admit that Megadeth is a Dave Mustaine solo project nowadays however \\"United Abominations\\" is not only the best Megadeth album in years it also takes on the role of being one of the best metal albums I've heard in a long time.  \\"Sleepwalker,\\" \\"Washington is Next,\\" and the classic Dave Mustaine rant filled title track all hark back to the Rust in Peace Peace Sells days.  Glen Drover is another great guitar player that hopefully Dave doesn't p*ss away as he has done to so many. In summation if you like Megadeth get this, if you love Megadeth but are wary of anything new by them get this, and if you are a new fan who thinks that \\"The System Has Failed\\" was awesome please buy this album....p.s. If you are one of those new fans pick up \\"Peace Sells, Rust in Peace or Countdown\\" also I enjoyed \\"The System Has Failed\\" but thought it was lacking.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|\\"Casino Royale\\", very un-Bond like, somewhat disappointing.  This movie in the Bond series, although I found it disappointing, is by far the most believable in the true to life sense.  I suppose I found it disappointing as there were no gadgets from Q.      This new actor, he's nice eye candy in his swimtrunks, but other than that, no fire.  His accent made the dialogue hard to understand at times.  There were awkward moments in the movie where there was no dialogue leaving the viewer with an empty feeling.    Judy Dench however, delivered her usual spitfire performance.  But it seemed hard to believe that she would have a secret communications device next to her bed.  Did you notice the man?  Her husband?      Another missing element was the \\"vodka martini, shaken not stirred\\".    Scene shifts were not smooth, no explanation of transition.        Felix Lighter, totally unexpected appearance.      Out of 5 stars, 3 is my rating.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|If you can get past the first 20 minutes of this movie without shutting it off, you're in for a treat.  The first part of this movie is quiet and boring and at times doesn't seem to make sense.  The first time I watched it, I shut it off.  The second time I sat down to see it, however, I let it play...after you get through the early history of the character, etc., the movie's sound picks up and so does the action.  It all comes together in a powerful thriller...Matt Damon is convincing.

B000641Z90|4.0|I very much liked Phil Collins First Farewell Tour except for the sound quality. Maybe I got a DVD that should have been bounced by quality control but the varying sound level (loud then soft) was irritating. The sound varied throughout the first disc. However, it was a lot better on the second disc.  Other than this one issue, I found the concert to be wonderful. Phil Collins, although older is better than ever. His performance was first class. His energy level and ability to move his audience impressive. More, his back up singers were great as was the band. The only thing better than this video would to have been there. What an event!     I strongly recommend this album to any Phil Collins fan.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but the DVD description intrigued me, a forensic investigator who happened to be a serial killer-who could resist? I was hooked after 15 minutes and each episode gets better than the last one. It is very smartly done with a touch of dark humor and a twist in every episode. Don't miss it!

1592332803|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful cookbooks I have seen.  Not only is there a wealth of information about Vegan Baking but the photographs make me want to spend my entire day in the kitchen trying to recreate them.    Since purchasing this book my wife and I have made numerous recipes from it; they have been easy to follow and we have enjoyed each one.  Just last night we made the Drop Bisquits and they were amazing.    But for me the recipe that has topped all the others is the Pancakes.  I know, I know, it sounds silly and simple, but we have been searching for a good Vegan Pancake recipe for a while.  We have made some from other cookbooks and have been disapointed.  The moment we tasted these Pancakes we knew we had found the best Vegan Pancake recipe out there.    So far this is my favorite cookbook in our collection and we have a couple shelves full of Vegan Cookboks.

B000UR9T82|5.0|An amazing boxset with TWO of the best Superhero movies of recent memory. The third... well not so much. Either way it is a trilogy and you can't ignore that the third didn't exist (hence the trilogy worth owning part). As for the bluray transfers, all are top notch and naturally get progressively better based on the age of each movie. I love it.
0452287588|5.0|For those who have not been exposed to, or who have not come to \\"see\\" the principle of duality - namely that of the true Self, and the self of form, the ego - this book is a great starting point. Even if you have attained a certain degree of enlightenment, this book gives an adept explanation of the subversive workings of the ego. Eckhart uses quotes from Jesus to Buddha to Lao Tzu: all of them pointing to the true nature of Being and this thing called ego. I recommend this book to anyone with an open heart that is searching to understand why life feels like a wheel out of kilter (dukha, per Buddha), and how to find the way out of the unnecessary madness that pervades the globe.
B000W1V44I|4.0|Kevin Richardson's departure from the Backstreet Boys downgraded the group to a quartet. So that's why I say \\"four members,four stars\\". But this album is the group's all-time largest,16 tracks. Between the 2005 release of NEVER GONE and this album,Brian Littrell put out his solo debut WELCOME HOME(in '06). Littrell,Howard Dorough,Alexander J. \\"A.J.\\" McLean and Nicholas Carter will continue pleasing their fans with this release like they first did with their self-titled debut a decade ago. I have yet to find out why Richardson left the group. Despite that,the group will woo a new army of female fans,even post-1997 babies. Like the predecessors,there's some soft rock and some funky get-down stuff. I know I'll enjoy hearing this one.

0140135154|1.0|\\"Ways of Seeing \\" has become so universally available, so overused (especially in academia), and so often quoted, that it's refreshing to read the reviews of so many intelligent naysayers here. \\"Ways of Seeing\\" is perhaps mistitled in that it really proposes only one way of seeing works of art, which is as artifacts in the history of capitalism.  It is propaganda, and like most propaganda, it heavily skews the evidence in favor of it's main argument, which is basically that European art from Raphael to Picasso is just a tool for enslaving women, non-Europeans and the working classes.  (Warning: Berger is a real kill-joy. If you read this book and imbibe it's themes, be prepared to never innocently enjoy your favorite old masters again!) However, I would advise anyone with a serious interest in art criticism and theory to get a copy, fill the margins with notes, consult the original sources, and decide for herself/himself how well it stands up. To give just one instance of how sloppy Berger can be, I would invite the reader to consider whether he bothered to learn anything about the art of perspective drawing before indicting it as ideologically tainted, and then trashing it, all in two short paragraphs.
0553582453|4.0|Subterfuge and psionics.      Fitz is back in the heart of it after the death of Nighteyes and his recovery in Dutiful, who it seems has much in common as far as the mental powers side of thing goes, and this is where Fitz turns his attention.    The political situation becomes more complicated when Dutiful's wife to be demands a quest of him to prove his worthiness.  It is a lot worse than cleaning out some stables or taming a wild bull, too.    Another finely written installment of the second Farseer trilogy.
B000V9KFLY|5.0|I am simply in awe of her talent. Her voice is ridiculously perfect and this album is stunning. Her version of O' Holy Night gets me speechless every time I hear it. I get literal chills. Its the best version I have ever heard. BTW, Josh Grobin arranged his version almost identically, but even his doesn't come close to her's. Ave Maria is quite beautiful as well. I even love her version of Blue Christmas. It is a MUST for poeple who love Christmas music.
0739337270|5.0|I listened to The Book Thief on CD and found it to be one of the most powerful stories I have read/heard in quite some time.  I found it on the Young Adults shelf in the public library.  Though I know that high school age readers will benefit by reading this novel, I feel that adults will be missing something important if they assume it is not an adult story.
0141301120|3.0|Not as good as the original.      The takeoff into the Sequel of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is ok, but the rest doesn't live up to it, unfortunately.    You can save the kids this one and go for some of Dahl's other work, or just go through the first book again.    The space mission here isn't as much fun and doesn't offer as much clever commentary as the other book.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I love Sarah's voice, its so soothing and different from half the artists out there. Her version of 'Have yourself a merry little Christmas' is my favorite track, Its sooo pretty and different from all the other versions out there. That is pretty much the only reason I bought this album, just after hearing that one song. And I'm happy to report I loved the rest of the album as well.
B000PWQOAI|1.0|THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN ABOUT THE NEWER 2002 RE-ISSUE AND SOMEHOW ENDED UP HERE* BE SURE THAT YOU ARE PURCHASING THE 1995 VERSION WITH THE SMALL PICTURE OF THE ORIGINAL COVER IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND YOU WILL GET THE ORIGINAL REMASTERED ALBUM WITH BOB DAISLEY AND LEE KERSLAKE ON IT...    Don't be fooled into believing this is the original [[ASIN:B000PWQOAI Diary of a Madman]].  This is a new version where the O$bournes and Sony have removed Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslakes original bass and drum parts.  They had new players re-record the bass and drum parts out of spite and to avoid paying royalties to Daisley and Kerslake.  This newly recorded/remixed/remasterd version has lost quite a bit of the incredible feel found on the original album (listen to the drum intro on track 5 \\"Little Dolls\\" to get an idea of how lame this new version actually is).  Also during the remix, it's my opinion that the engineers missed the opportunity to make Randy's guitar parts sound any better, they actually sound less cohesive due to the alternating positioning in the mix. Another remix issue is the keyboards are louder in the mix, sounding a bit off key in places and distracting from Randy's guitar even more).  I was fooled into believing this might be the original version because the online product track listing only lists the original 8 album tracks. In actuality this version has a bonus track, \\"I Dont Know\\" (live).  Had the item descripion listed this bonus track, I would have known that this was the \\"suck\\" version and would never have bought it. This version is definately inferior to the original but it does come with beautifully re-created original album artwork. I hope that someone at Sony gets a fricken clue and re-releases the original someday, this version pales in comparison...
0553573411|4.0|Conflict and war.      An older Fitz is now not quite so lonely as his Wit talent has enabled him to bond with a wolf partner, and he finds he has a thing for a young local woman, as well.    However, his psychic abilities and the group he has been using them with fall victim to a political rival, a conflict that they don't need with the Red Ship Raiders on their doorstep.    Fitz has to survive all this in a story excellently told by Hobb from a first person point of view.  Just as good as the first book.
B000TX7B5U|4.0|well i didn't buy it because i couldn't buy it, i had other expenses. so i downloaded each song and put it on a blank disc. but anyway i'm very impressed with serj's effort. i hope he'll make another one. only song i dispise is praise the lord..... i just can't clinged on it. sounds like i doesn't make sense. but each song has its own character that that shows serj can do anything with flying colors. standouts include the 2 singles, saving us, lie lie lie, sky is over, feed us, and well all others except the one mentioned above. i can't wait to compare this to daron's project. btw the tittle track is a little slow but not boring at least.
B0000263JN|5.0|In is only of recent times that I got to know about this band and what a surprise. They were contemporaries of the beatles and yet they are so little known. Their songs are full of great lyrics with many twist in the accompanying musical score. The Scottish influence shows through and they can be described as early pioneers in world music with daring to be different. Take the time to listen to the lyrics one time, they are really interesting!
0553582461|4.0|Skillmaster and the Dragon.      The quest for the dragon involves some perilous and arduous sea travel and other journeying, which many of this party are not particularly sorted too. Fitz, as Skillmaster has a few problems on his hands, least of which is the actual reason behind this trip to start with, and what the Fool is really up to.    Another fine book, but I think a few people are going to be annoyed by the Fitz/Fool resolution, if you can call it that.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|All the praise is deserved (it's garnered fantastic reviews just about everywhere).  It's a small, terrific film that will stay with you.  Find it and watch it.
B000E5KJFC|4.0|The movie is excelent, quality of HD DVD.  The subs are spanish, french and english, but only in the movie, the extras (like the alternative ends or the interview)have not subtituled and are normal quality, no HD.  Then the intenational buyers can buy this movie. (I am from Mexico)
B000UNYJV8|2.0|The themes of masculinity, and disallusioned youth seeking justice are great themes.  I applaud the makers for taking it on.  But what it lacks is something key to entertainment: an interesting story.  It comes off as a mere social commentary in which Thatcher's 80s are subtley compared to the present.  There was good acting, especially by the protagonist.  But there was no real solution or direction given and therefore left one feeling a bit hopeless at the end.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|Everybody's favorite friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is back and faces his greatest challenge yet in the exciting comic book smash hit \\"Spider-Man 3\\". Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally enjoying his life. The citizens of New York City honor Spider-Man for his heroic actions and Peter feels ready to ask sweetheart Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him. Unfortunately, new villains seek to destroy the web-slinging hero and an alien parasite has attached itself to Peter's costume and changes his personality for the worse. \\"Spider-Man 3\\" isn't the best in the popular comic book franchise but is indeed an entertaining superhero adventure that delivers plenty of humor and thrills. There are several moments when its complex storyline and too many supporting characters make this third installment feel long and sluggish. The summer blockbuster features some remarkable special effects and terrific action sequences. \\"Spider-Man 3\\" also stars James Franco, Topher Grace, Thomas Hayden Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris and James Cromwell.<br /><br />The Blue-Ray release of \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a well recommended purchase. The 2007 summer blockbuster is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its crystal clear picture quality is truly excellent. This is the type of Blue-ray that you'll want to show off in your high definition television. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound is first-rate with great clarity and intense surround effects. There are over two hours of behind-the-scenes featurettes that focus on the film's production and visual effects. Other special features include photo galleries, Snow Patrol \\"Signal Fire\\" music video, trailers, TV spots, blooper reel and two informative audio commentaries by director Sam Raimi, cast members and production crew. Overall, \\"Spiderman 3\\" scores \\"B+\\".
1570628033|5.0|This is the second time I'm reading Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha in a new translation by Sherab Chodzin Kohn. The first is translated by Hilder Rosner. I believe the translator is a practicing Buddhist. Inevitably, his version is tinged with a stronger Buddhist flavour than the original translation. Nonetheless, the lyricism of the prose is retained, and I find it no less poetic.<br /><br />Siddharta's intellectual pride makes him reject all teachings, including the Buddha's, to seek his own path. That path leads him to samsara, to material greed and desires of the flesh. And when he thinks he has found the one true path at the river, his former lover brings him a son, and he has to go through the pain of severing that final manifestation of ego all over again. All these, Hesse concludes, are part of the lessons that the seeker has to experience in order to find the  truth - a truth that is beyond words, beyond the duality that hides behind words.<br /><br />This time round, I'm also more profoundly affected by the different characters in the book, and the human bonds that tie them to Siddhartha. Each of them stands for a human condition, and yet Hesse, with great economy of skill, is able to make them fully fleshed-out characters.<br /><br />Govinda, in particular, strikes me as a most moving character. He's not too bright, this Govinda, but he's earnest, loyal, and sincere. The two times that he meets Siddhartha along the river are the most touching episodes in the book.  It's telling that Siddhartha reveals the summation of his long spiritual search to Govinda in the final chapter. Two old men, once the closest of friends, sit beside a river under the setting sun, discussing the ultimate truth of life. It is the calmest of images, but the questions asked and the answers given vibrate with cosmic significance.<br /><br />Read Siddhartha for an immensely poetic rendition of the spiritual search into the true meaning of life.
B00000273D|5.0|As a kid I found myself listening to this album of 70's genius and enjoying every minute of it! It's indescribable, other than very well thought out, maginitive, and pleasing to the senses. You cannot go wrong, unless you are not a true fan of music. My favorite tracks are Romantic Warrior, The Sorceress, and The Duel Between the Jester and the Tyrant. There should have been a movie built around this cd! It would have scored major points! Well, at least with me!!
1594489505|5.0|I loved Kite Runner but Hosseini delivered even more so with this book. Very well written and captivating until the end.  The character development and story and about women in Afghanistan make this a must read novel.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|No, no, anything but this! Just exactly how much money Larry King was paid to review this stinker hghly is unknown. What should be known is that DeNiro laid an egg here, a really rotten one. Local hero Matt Damon  pays the ultiimate price-totally miscast as the CIA rising star,who's ascent adversely affects his demeanor,marriage and family.How many trillion men in history could say/have said the same thing? The entire \\"production\\" is entirely too long, tedious,boring. And, again, it's becoming obvious to this reviewer that if Damon is playing a role that seems to be a part of himself-see \\"Rounders\\", \\"Good Will Hunting\\", the \\"Bourne\\" series etc,-then he's very good. Otherwise, he's typically as useful as Wally Cox would have been playing \\"Patton\\"! One positive point: the movie IS marginally better than \\"Ski Party\\".
072325804X|5.0|This very affordable volume has all of the Potter titles including a few I had never seen before (some of them not published during the author's lifetime).  The rabbit stories seem to get the attention when people speak of Potter's work.  But for my money the mouse stories are the best: especially \\"The Tailor of Gloucester\\" and \\"The Tale of Johhny Town-Mouse.\\"  I hadn't remembered how much all of Beatrix Potter's tales seem to revolve around eating and being eaten. They are in that regard, as in others, an excellent reflection of th e real \\"lives\\" of the animals that she dresses and gives words to.  The paintings are wonderfully reproduced here and, if the book is much too large and heavy for little hands, it is a very good size for setting on one's lap along with the child who wants a story.
6304698526|5.0|For people with absolutely nothing to do,rate the famous chase scene in this legendary hit with the one 3000 miles away several years later in \\"The French Connection\\". Both Frank and Popeye are \\"loose canon\\"cops, supported by highly liberal bosses.Also, in both instances, the police quickly reverse roles,faster than a Clark Kent undressing,becoming the reckless persuers, wanting desperately to atone for past blunders. The spectacular cinematography in San Francinco is contrasted to the stark realism of Brooklyn, but our heroes get their men, albeit in very different ways. Be forwarned to get your vote in quickly, lest Matt Damon attract all non AARP voters in \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\".
B000UR9T8C|2.0|By \\"most disappointing movie of the summer,\\" let me clarify that \\"Spider-Man III\\" was not the worst movie of the summer by any means, but in terms of the quality we were expecting compared to the quality we received, it definitely is at the bottom of the list.    Well, I saw it, partly because my ex-girlfriend had some free tickets and partly because I had to pass by the theater anyways because it was on the way to the library.  And I can say that \\"Spider-Man III\\" instantly made the list of one of the year's most disappointing films.  The film is so mediocre that it will immediately make you want to watch \\"Spider-Man I and II: They Were Better\\" over again, just to regain your pleasant memories of the franchise.    Well, I guess there's some fun to be had with \\"Spider-Man III,\\" but it's a pale shadow of what's come before.  What's wrong with the film?  The first problem is that it tries to cram way too much into its 140-minute running time.  Not only is Spider-Man fighting two villains to begin with, he's also having to deal with an evil alien substance (which came from God knows where) that briefly turns him evil.  Then, he gets this substance off only for it to possess the character of a rival photographer.  So Spider-Man is fighting three villains, in addition to having to deal with a surprisingly whiny Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, looking as weepy and helpless as ever).  With all these subplots going on, none of them ever quite gains momentum, and some simply stop in mid-sentence.    The plotting alone would have sunk the film to a good degree, but there is a lot of other awful stuff happening.  First, there's the acting.  As mentioned earlier, Dunst is little more than a screentime eater.  Tobey Maguire is good as the normal Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but is jaw-droppingly godawful as their evil alter ego.  He reminded me of Hayden Christiansen in \\"Attack of the Clones\\" more than a terrifying menace.  Hayden Church and Franco are OK as Sandman and Goblin (respectively), but Topher Grace as Venom gives one of the worst performances in a comic book film this decade.  He plays Venom with all the cheesy menace of a Fantastic Four villain, and his appearance immediately took me out of the film.    Then there's tonal problems.  Parts of the movie are as campy as anything in \\"Batman and Robin,\\" (especially the increasingly awful one-liners) while others are similar in tone to a soap opera, making for a bizarre contrast that never fits together.  Perhaps most irritatingly, there are serious gaps in logic.  Why is Sandman not shocked at all that he's suddenly turned into a Sandman?  Since when did Harry Osbourne's butler become a genius?  Why can Sandman withstand the pummeling of a speeding train but not two small rockets?  Doesn't Harry forgive someone awfully fast that blew half his face off?  Doesn't Sandman change his mind about Spider-Man awfully quickly?  And Mary Jane...    I'm going to stop here, to try to not give away too much.  This is definitely a major disappointment, on the level of \\"X3.\\"  Its studio is obviously panicky over its financial performance, as it was quick to release polls that showed how much people \\"liked the film.\\"  They're covering up something, as I have yet to meet anyone that has said anything more positive about it other than, \\"Well, it wasn't as good as the first two, but it still entertained me.\\"  So, if you feel you must see it, beware to lower your expectations beforehand.  Otherwise, you face crushing disappointment.
6305308659|5.0|O.K.  I'll to try to help people get the most out of this movie.       First, I recommend you wait to see this movie until you're atleast 18 years old.  And, no, I'm not saying that this movie should be rated 'R'.  I just think you have to have a certain amount of education under your belt, and be contemplating life in general, to fully embrace this film.    Now, regarding what the movie is about...      It's about two siblings who have different views of what the perfect world should be--neither of which is totally correct.  Despite the title, I don't think the movie is about the town of Pleasantville.  Sure, almost everything we see happens there, and there are plenty of scenes that don't show either David or Jennifer (the two kids); but, I think that the town is there more as a learning device for the kids, and as a reminder to us, the audience, of our real-world history.  You have to keep in mind that this movie is partly a comedy.  If you get bogged down trying to figure out what everything is a metaphor for, you may miss a laugh, because most of the time there are only partial metaphors.  Pleasantville doesn't represent 1950's America.  (They actually did have toilets and \\"real rain\\" back then.)  It's a fake world that David thought would be a great place to live in.  Unfortunately, a world where nothing bad ever happens just doesn't exist (when real people are involved).  David, himself, helped mess up his perfect world just by being late for work once.  Jennifer, on the other hand, is upset that she's been unwillingly thrown into this world that is far from her ideal one; so, she does her best to try to change Pleasantville into what she wants.    The following are my comments on what other reviewers have said:     --Unlike what some reviewers have said, it seems like both liberal and conservative views are expressed here; and in the end, neither one is found to be always better than the other.  Sometimes, change is forced on us even when nobody wants it(e.g., natural disasters).  Either you find a way to deal with the change, possibly learn from it, and move forward; or, you can spend the rest of your life wishing for the olden days, feeling miserable, because you know they will never return.       --Whoever brought up Nazis in relation to this movie must have been watching something quite different from what I was.  Religious freedom and sexual orientation are two subjects that this movie never even tried to touch on.  And, the most physical harm that I can remember seeing in this film, was one guy with a bloody lip.  Or, if you're referring to the book burning, it's not like the Nazis are the only ones who have tried to remove certain literature from society.       --Anyone who said this movie promotes sexual promiscuity wasn't watching closely enough.  In fact, they must have completely ignored everything that went on with Jennifer in the second half of the movie.  David and Jennifer even talked about how becoming colored couldn't just be about sex.  However, I do wish that sex hadn't been used as frequently as it was, and probably shouldn't have been, if they really wanted this to be a family-friendly film.       --This story was also NOT an allegory for the Garden of Eden.  The garden was made reference to a couple of times, but it certainly is not what the movie is all about.  Especially with the Don Knotts part, I can't understand why anyone would seriously think that the TV repairman was supposed to represent God in anything but the loosest sense.  That character was there almost solely for humor.  The citizens of Pleasantville never make any mention of any religion at all.  So, how anyone can say that this movie is an attack on their religion is mind-boggling to me.    If Gary Ross is guilty of anything, it might be too much ambition.  But this story worked for me on all levels.  I enjoyed the serious parts and the silly parts.  And I hope I can continue to live in color.  <<fade to black playing Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\">>
0743486285|5.0|Well, I grew up with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles.  I had vaguely heard of Motley Crue, and Tommy Lee and all his women.  But, I knew nothing about Nikki Sixx.      I picked it up because I love illustrated books, and I thought it might be interesting, since drugs were a big part of the culture in \\"my day\\".      It was very touching, very intense - I had to put it down a few times and read a comic book or something!  I think it's very honest, and I liked the way that he put in his recent thoughts and those of others who were in his life at that time.      I'm just glad that he was able to work things out, and hopefully, help someone else.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Fabulous and solid.  He's found a new voice that he uses so beautifully. Girls in Summer Clothes is a great example of this.  The addition of strings to his already solid band is just a treat.
B000TGCR38|3.0|The story's just a bit too fantastic (however much it may be based on a true story); the editing is just a bit too quick (attempting to compact said fantastic story into two and a half hours); and the acting is just way too stagey to draw much of an emotional response (at least from this reviewer). Unfortunately, as far as Verhoeven's influence is concerned, this is more of an action thriller in the vein of Total Recall with a script that reads like Showgirls, rather than a social commentary akin to Starship Troopers or RoboCop. So, think lots of characters being smashed in the face with blunt objects, but without much reasoning. Not that that wasn't the Nazi's modus operandi -- I just expect more from such a great director taking on some very tough subject matter from his homeland. (6/10)

In New York two policemen arrive at a bar to search everyone [no warrant?]. One man is selected for questioning. Doyle believes a big shipment of heroin will arrive in New York soon. We see a French TV star arrive in New York with his Continental.    The police are able to wiretap that store and a home in the hope of finding drugs. Doyle's private life is shown - a mess. Abandoned and confiscated automobiles are sold at auction. The film shows the classic 3-man tail following the luncheon owner. Two others come into the picture. All are followed. There is big money in this shipment; big money is behind this deal (he knows about the wiretaps!). The film shows many scenes of New York city in the early 1970s. Doyle's cover is blown by subway tag. An auto accident upsets some plans. Then there is a sniper on a building! Unbelievable, but it leads to a classic car chase that is used to fill screen time.    Now they follow the brown Continental to where it is parked downtown in a deserted area. Who will pick it up? The car is impounded and taken in for a search. Nothing is found hidden inside. But why is it 120 pounds overweight? They discover the reason. Frog One drives it to the rendezvous. The heroin is transferred to a new hiding place and money changes hands. But a glitch develops in their best laid plan. An isolated area can act like a closed trap. There is a shoot out to provide added drama. [Believable?]    There is irony when they show the sentences handed out, and the reward for Doyle and Russo. The language in this film stretched the conventions. Was it due to the producer G. David Schine? The action in this film overshadows the weak plot. [Sixty kilograms weight 132 pounds. A quart of water weighs about 2 lbs. Was there enough space for all that powder?]
B00005JPWH|5.0|We just might have a second dark horse Best Picture nominee featuring a bus on our hands -- one that actually has a heart beating behind the celluloid. Sure, this film has it's faults, but it's uncanny ability to tap into viewers emotional subconscious more than makes up for the few points it loses in the style department. For instance, why Sean Penn chose to use voiceover in certain sections and handwriting on the screen in others will always allude me -- not to mention the low production quality of the title sequence. That said, it took me awhile to initially settle into the film, but once it took flight there was really no looking back. Emile Hirsch's performance is incredible; the story is wrenching; Eddie Vedder's songs perfectly compliment the material; and the whole experience lingered with me. Moreover, while there is an obvious element of political subtext involved, I found it difficult not to agree with this film's resounding message of forgiveness and responsibility. Despite Sean Penn's personal views, I think that he's truly made a film that everyone can take something positive away from. (9/10)
0767827902|5.0|This is a great trip down memory lane to see many of my favorite actors in their youth (Cybill Shepherd hasn't changed much). Anyone who has grown up in a small town will identify with the love/hate relationship these characters show for small town life, especially when everyone knows your 'dirty laundry'. Though there isn't much action, the relationships between friends/parents/townsfolk is heartbreaking. Great movie for 'classic' collectors of all ages. It's especially interesting that this movie was originally rated 'X' in its time. By today's standards, it's relatively 'tame'.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000UNYK3A|5.0|The first time you watch \\"Hostel\\" you leave remembering two things: an insane amount of sex and nudity, and some truly brutal torture sequences.  The media ignoranty dubbed it a new genre, \\"torture porn\\".  This film is actually rather tame when compared to some of Italy's 70's horror, grindhouse flicks like \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\", and some of Asia's current horror masters.  Nontheless, horror fans drooled, sqeamish movie-goers and media watchdogs were offended, then everybody moved on.  The truth is this: \\"Hostel\\" is the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" of our generation.  After taking this so-called \\"director's cut\\" re-release as an opportunity to revisit a recent horror film I remembered fondly -if mostly for the two reasons stated above- I came to realize why so many people (not the least of which is Quentin Tarantino) believe in Eli Roth as a horror savior.<br /><br />\\"Hostel\\" is a film layered with subtle humor that builds suspense beautifully and gives the audience exactly what they want to see while making them feel as though they've seen worse things than they actually have; all TCM hallmarks.  The characters, obnoxiously American protagonists and European antagonists alike, are all both likeable, depraved, and almost feel like people you may know or have met somewhere before.  You laugh with them, you scream with them, and you wonder what your own friends and family are truly capable of.  Also reminiscent of TCM is the slaughterhouse feel one gets from the entire process of this torture industry where angry Europeans can take out their frustration with Americans and other tourists for a fee, thus comparing the suffering of the victims to that of animals harvested for slaughter. Be it simply for irony's sake, vegetarian propaganda, or both; it is nicely done.  Had I reviewed this flick after one veiwing, I'd have given it 4 stars, tops, but having spent a little more time with \\"Hostel\\", I've found that there really is much more than meets the eye here.  It really is a damn near flawless horror film with lots of little jokes I missed the first time around (keychain anybody?) and a final act that is so delightfully insane you can't help but smile as Roth intentionally pushes the limits of implausibility to comical levels while giving the audience bloody satisfaction. I love it.<br /><br />While these DVD's are packed with extras that the studio apparently wouldn't allow Roth to include in the intitial release, as a director's cut this release fails miserably. The film itself is entirely unchanged except for an alternate ending.  And that ending is awful, nonsensical, confounding, out of character, and pretty much inferior to the original cut in every possible way.  So why the 5 stars?  Because Roth was wise enough to include both versions so that you can choose to watch the original unrated version with the good ending intact.  No harm, no foul.  There are no less than four commentaries, tons of lengthy featurettes, around 20 minutes of deleted scenes, and an interview with the most hardcore director in the business, Japan's twisted and talented Takashi Miike (who has a cameo in the film) among other extras.  Many of these special features were on the first DVD so this release is really only for those who have put off buying this movie. And if you haven't yet, now is the time.near flawless horror film with lots of little jokes I missed the first time around (keychain anybody?) and a final act that is so delightfully insane you can't help but smile as Roth intentionally pushes the limits of implausibility to comical levels while giving the audience bloody satisfaction.

B000BKJ78U|5.0|Well I first saw these movies when I was a kid, and I really enjoyed watching them again.  The remastering of sound and special effects are stunning (no more cruddy outlines around the ships).  The additional scenes also did not detract from the movie for me; I really don't care who shot first as long as the basic premise remains the same (they shoot at the same time here).  This is a great addition to any collection.
0140120416|5.0|What a great book for anyone studying the Russian language! It's very well organized with lots of vocabulary and practice. If you learn by \\"doing\\", this book will challenge you to do just that with written exercises.    I recommend this book to anyone who is self-studying Russian (as I do with all of my languages.) It's very concise, easy-to-understand and user-friendly.

0061547832|5.0|This latest publication by Trump is both an easy read and is classic Trump.  All the branding that made Trump so successful is contained in this book.  The advice delivered by Trump is highly motivational and addresses some of his failures that he turned into successes.  Sure the same advice has been delivered before but the frankness of Trump's lessons is truly memorable. If you have ever wondered what happened to Carolyn on the Apprentice and or his motivation for standing up to Rosie O'Donnell it's all inside.     In the event you manage to miss the main points they are summarized at the end of each chapter.  Bill Zanker does an impressive job in each chapter reinforcing Trump's points with examples of how he applied the concepts discussed while building the Learning Annex.
1428144552|5.0|I had heard a lot about \\"The Secret\\" transforming lives, but I had not yet come across the book or DVD (neither of which would fit into my busy schedule). The audiobook was just perfect for my commute to and from work. It's inspiring. It packaged up a philosophy I was familiar with from a variety of teachings--mostly Edgar Cayce--into one fluid, accessible product. Edgar Cayce said all this stuff over 75 years ago--a nice reminder that \\"thoughts are things\\" and \\"your life is what you create it to be.\\" Since \\"The Secret,\\" mine's getting better everyday!

B000WSL5Y0|4.0|The opening scene of \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" takes us back to \\"Mystic River\\" territory on the mean streets of Boston.  The camera pans over a neighborhood populated by a multitude of ethnic groups, with its share of derelicts and punks, working class stiffs, and people who sit on their stoops all day peering at passersby.  We learn that a gorgeous four-year-old named Amanda has been abducted from her home.  Amanda's single mother, Helene McCready, played with a perfect blend of sexuality and sleaze by Amy Ryan, makes a televised plea for her daughter's return. Helene, an alcoholic and a drug addict, has never let Amanda's needs interfere with her active social life.  Her contemptuous sister-in-law, Bea (Amy Madigan), who is childless, is even more broken up than Helene about Amanda's disappearance; Bea loves the child as if she were her own and would do anything to get her niece back.  In desperation, Bea and her husband hire a pair of private investigators, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to \\"augment the investigation,\\" hoping that they will accomplish what the police have failed to do--find out what happened to the little girl.<br /><br />Although Angie has a bad feeling about this case, she and Patrick agree to do what they can.  They come to regret this decision, since Amanda's disappearance is more than just a straightforward kidnapping; it turns out to be a mysterious and complex situation fraught with lies, betrayal, hypocrisy, and mortal danger.  Patrick, in particular, will be tested in ways that he could never have anticipated, and his relationship with Angie will be strained to the breaking point when the truth is finally revealed.<br /><br />Ben Affleck's directorial debut is impressive.  He captures the atmosphere of working class Boston perfectly:  the casual profanity, the lowlifes who carry on their business dealings without interference from the cops, and the racial tension are all convincingly depicted.  John Toll's brooding cinematography adds to the gloom and Affleck's camera angles and close-ups heighten the drama and the intensity of the already emotional proceedings.<br /><br />The screenplay, adapted from the Dennis Lehane novel by Affleck and Aaron Stockard, is a bit muddy and far-fetched.  Although viewers will get the general idea of what is going on, the motives and actions of the major players are sometimes unclear.  A few of the actors slur their words, making it difficult to decipher the dialogue.  The ending, which is a shocker, doesn't quite ring true.  In spite of these flaws, the stellar performances by an outstanding cast transcend the script's deficiencies.  As always, Morgan Freeman is solid as a police chief whose personal tragedy left him permanently scarred.  Ed Harris is Detective Remy Bressard, a troubled and cynical cop who does not hesitate to cut corners when it suits him.  Michelle Monaghan is Patrick's lovely and kindhearted girlfriend whose compassion for Amanda overrides all other considerations.  The superb Casey Affleck plays the pivotal role of Patrick with an emotional toughness that is startling in someone so boyishly good looking.  He is forced on several occasions to make abrupt, life-altering decisions, knowing that he may come to regret them some day.  \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a harrowing film about selfishness, greed, immorality, and the rationalizations that we make so that we can continue to live with ourselves.graphy adds to the gloom and Affleck's camera angles and close-ups heighten the drama and the intensity of the already emotional proceedings.

B000TGCR38|3.0|There are two things about Black Book that made me wish I had not spent the time watching it. Number one, the movie starts out several years after the main story. Because of this, we already know the ultimate outcome for the main character, and the suspense of all the travails of that character is blunted.     Number two, the main character's situation and her trials are sympathetic. But the character is played so cool (not completely cold, but definitely cool) emotionally that I did not buy it. She gets in some incredibly tight spots and doesn't really show the tension and strain to make it believable. Not for me, at least. Maybe some people like that kind of a heroine, but honestly Lara Croft shows more humanity sometimes than this gal.     These are two serious flaws. They didn't ruin the movie, but made it much less enjoyable.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|BEOWULF & GRENDEL is a visually stunning (both good and bad) retelling of the epic tale of man vs. beast.  The filmmakers attempt to update the story, this time including Grendel's side of the story, giving him motivation for his bloodthirsty rampages.  The effort is ultimately wasted as the ludicrous script is laden with preposterous dialogue and even more rediculous acting.<br /><br />Grendel (and his \\"family\\") are essentially oversized neanderthal-men... an interesting concept that gives them interactions and emotions as opposed to the traditional telling which makes them faceless man-eaters.  However, for all his grunting, moaning, and flexing rubber muscles (some of the WORST prosthetic work since the Planet of the Apes TV series), he still doesn't seem to garner much sympathy.  He does, however, somehow manage to father another man/beast with the neighborhood witch (who else?) in one of the most bizarre \\"conception\\" scenes ever - the witch appears to placidly accept her \\"taking\\" by a giant ogre, then in the retelling of the event gets heated up enough to \\"jump\\" Beowulf, giving the man and beast more than one thing in common.  Eee[...]  (Let's hope this doesn't open the door to a sequel.)<br /><br />Filmed in rural Iceland, the scenery is engrossing, stark and probably the most believably emotive character in the movie.  The \\"hero\\" Beowulf makes no attempt to adjust his heavy Scottish accent despite his character's supposed Swedish heritage.  He looks bored.  And tired.  I got bored and tired watching him.  The witch makes no attempt to adjust her straightforward american accent... blah, blah, blah...  She looks more like a disgruntled university student who wants to show the world what a bad-a-- she can be.  Heck, I guess a roll in the hay with Grendel gives you street cred...<br /><br />If you're hoping for blood, guts, or battle scenes, they're too few and far between, but remarkably unexciting.  Imagine Steve Carrell wielding a sword in a bad 70's kung-fu movie and you'll get a pretty good idea of the fight choreography quality.<br /><br />The bottom line is every one in the film appeared uncomfortable in their roles, clothes, dialogue, on camera, and/or with whatever they had for lunch.  I wanted to toss my cookies, too.pretty good idea of the fight choreography quality.

B00005JM1F|4.0|Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn, this is a buddy film.  All the immature fools that hit 30 and pine for those carefree college days, even Old Blue, the 80 year-old pledge, oh, to go back to those nubile young drunken girls and the total lack of any reality based responsibility or meaningful relationship, those were the days my friend.  We thought they'd never end, etc.     Look, the jokes are college prat, but there's some laugh-out-loud.  The Will Ferrell go-nutso scenes especially, the tranquializer dart scene, the nude romp in front of the wife's friends, and the zany hazing scenes are very funny. My special comedy success meter, the wifey laughed out loud as if on happy gas again and again.

B000VWYNOG|3.0|Its not easy to rate this, the music is terrific but what is the idea behind it?  Who is it for?  I'm a fan and I have all his official releases and lots more but this is not a Greatest Hits, he has hardly had any.  It isn't a best of either, how can it be with nothing from Astral Weeks on it.  The packaging (I bought the 3CD version) is nothing special, the notes are very poor, just a list of what and when things were released.  There is only one \\"rarity\\" and while its Ok the original release is better.  It is now some time since Morrison released anything original.  This is a greatest hits, the previous one was a best of and the one before that was a movie compilation.  The release before that was Pay The Devil a third rate country pastiche that is perhaps his second worst release of all time.  It is apparent that these releases are part of a retirement plan and if so how about the long promised box set?  I am more convinced than ever that he has nothing more to say and that rehashed compilations will be the order of the day for some time.  I hope I'm wrong but things look distinctly unpromising.
1401300529|4.0|A true picture of the early \\"50's - the war - the presidency - the riddle of MacArthur- the reasons for his firing - the attacks on Truman (which history redemmed the rightness of his actions). A very thoughtful presentation of that period- a well-written book.
B000062X90|5.0|Well, like a few other reviewers, I found this band through being an Iron Maiden fan!  I was digging through a friend's father's LP collection in the early 90's and we put on \\"Live Bites\\" and I thought \\"Whoah! Sounds like a 70's version of Iron Maiden\\".  Years later, I picked up Argus on an old memory and was a little bemused at how \\"not heavy-metal\\" it was.  However, after a few listens, it has become one of my favorite albums of the early 70s.    Wishbone Ash in the early 70s mixed various influences of the times:  heavy metal, progressive rock, folk rock, jam rock, boogie, etc.  However, their metal mostly surfaces on the first 2 albums and the live stuff - I've learned to accept this album as a relatively mellow recording, but with a little kick to it.  Mostly what stands out is the fantastic instrumental interplay - each of the 4 musicians brings something wonderful to the music, plus the harmony vocals are pleasant.  The combination of very melodic and up-front bass and frequent harmony guitars is what brings the Iron Maiden comparisons, although here the music is more mellow!  Not that it's completely sleepy - there's some nice energetic parts in it.  \\"Leaf and Stream\\" follows a tradition of folk-rock inspired songs that appear on most of this band's early 70's recordings, rather reminiscent of (and, I believe, inspired by) Fairport Convention songs like \\"Fotheringay\\" and \\"Crazy Man Michael\\" - it's a wonderfully beautiful sound not often heard in rock, very melodic and with lovely (electric) guitar arpeggios.  Certainly a step up from your average \\"power ballad\\"!  Half of the record tends towards a kind of medieval/fantasy feel with songs such as \\"Warrior\\" and \\"Throw Down the Sword\\".   Check this out if you like tasteful and melodic guitar and bass and sensitive and interesting drumming.
0312263511|3.0|What a great read. Parts of this book was a bit hokey, but I really enjoyed the book. Based on what I've read in other material about NASA, Gene was one of the most liked astronauts. What a great guy. A must read. I've read a lot of material and books on the Mecury thru Apollo missions, and I think the best I've read was Micheal Collins \\"Carrying the Fire\\" this lends itself to great detail and leaves you with a good education.

081541028X|5.0|Having read a lot from Gemini-thru Apollo, this is by far the best book yet. Collins and the writter do such a great job on details and made for an very interesting read. I wish he would have gone into more detail about him being the only one in the CM when Armstrong and Aldren were on the surface of the moon. To me, that had to be a very interesting place to be. I thought it was great Charles Lindberg wrote a few things in the front of the book. I can add, in addition to this book having read \\"Failure is not an option\\" by Gene Krantz add a back drop of technical data to support what these guys did. Seeing how this all works from mission controlls end is a good knowledge to have. Again, a great read and highly recomend it for your library.    Micheal Collins, you were the ticket home.    KLD

B00006YXOX|5.0|I was looking for Bruckner's cycle and I bought this one because previous good reviews  and also because a program in Spain's Radio Clasica did a retrospective of Eugen Jochum that I enjoyed a lot. This is what I expected: deep, balanced and with the right tempi. The quality of the sound is good, too (at least, in my poor-man set) and the price is moderate (for us, who pay in Euros, I would say even cheap).
B00005V1B2|5.0|This recording is a masterwork by a band underrecognized in its era.  This work is essentially instrumental with limited vocals (without words). The moods created by this lush textural and atmospheric recording are extraordinary.  This work draws on significant classical and jazz influences in a rock context and withstands the 32 year test of time since its release unblemished.  It stands as one of the great monuments of the progressive rock era without many of the excesses and overindulgences of the era.
