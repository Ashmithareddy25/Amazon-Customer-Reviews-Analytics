B00004Z459|1.0|I originally had a one-star review on here earlier, but I thought that review kind of sucked, so I'll write a better review.<br /><br />In the 7th grade, I was a huge Linkin Park fan, and I only got my music off of the radio. I did not know about true metal about that time. All I listened to was nu-metal, pop-punk and alternative rock. Times change for everyone. Those days are over. And I am done with Linkin Park.<br /><br />Linkin Park are one of the most overrated groups and untalented groups out there. I listened to this CD four years later and discovered that this is garbage. I usually don't care for lyrics in my music, but with redundant lyrics like \\"Shut up when I'm talking to you\\" and \\"I tried so hard and got so far\\", you know this music was made for teenagers. I am 16 years old, but I listen to artists about 1,000,000,000 times more creative than Linkin Park.<br /><br />Machine Head tends to be one of the artists hacked from on this record, and I'm talking about \\"Burning Red\\" era Machine Head. It's \\"The Burning Red\\", but it's made corporate and watered down with flooded turntables and terrible vocals. This is my description of this sad excuse for a record.<br /><br />The songs really aren't that great. Turntables flood the material over. Incubus and Deftones use turntables in their music, but they don't use them as much as Linkin Park. The vocals reminded me of something that you would hear from the average boy band. I don't know if I'm just being ironic, but during the softer parts in \\"Crawling\\", Chester sounds like the singer of Savage Garden. I may be sounding like an idiot, but this is MY review. \\"One Step Closer\\" is extremely overplayed, but not as much as \\"In The End\\", which STILL gets played on the pop radio stations ad nauseum.<br /><br />It's time to try something better, people. Linkin Park is just a corporate MTV puppet that sells themselves out terribly. Buy ANYTHING EXCEPT THIS (except garbage by Good Charlotte and Limp Bizkit).
B0007YMUZW|4.0|It was hard to predict what form Cold Roses would take. Since the collapse of Ryan Adams' pioneering Americana band Whiskeytown, he's made the forlorn Heartbreaker, the classic rock Gold, the abrasive Rock 'n' Roll and the disturbing Love is Hell EPs. During this period <br />he found the time to play in The Finger, a punk rock side project with Jesse Malin, the metal band Warewolf, and record three as yet unreleased albums. <br /> <br />Cold Roses opens with 'Magnolia Mountain', a track that immediately places the listener back in familiar territory.  Unlike the brattish stylings of Rock 'n' Roll, or the amphetamine fuelled Love is Hell sessions, it is awash with acoustic guitar and pedal steel.  Soon, the whole band is jamming and playing loose, lending the songs a live barroom feel.  Count-ins are included and before one number Ryan shouts, \\"You better believe me L-U-V!  Give me a beer!\\"  On this evidence, it sounds as if he is back in the alt country saddle where he belongs.  <br /> <br />'Sweet Illusions' and 'Let It Ride' are as catchy as anything that Ryan has recorded before.  'Meadowlake Street' is sublime, starting with just his vocals and finger picked guitar, but building to a towering colossus that U2 would be proud of.  'Beautiful Sorta' is old school rock and blues straight out of the 70s, and 'Now That You're Gone' is a melancholy lament that would be at home on Heartbreaker. It has the same dustbowl sound of Gram Parsons, Neil Young and The Band. <br /> <br />On Cold Roses, Ryan has stopped pretending that he's a cool NYC kid, gone back to his Whiskeytown roots, harmonica, honky tonk-keys and all.  It might have been a stronger album with fewer tracks, but small doses are not Ryan's style.  As it stands, Cold Roses is a welcome return to form.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I may be jumping the gun with a 5 star rating, but With Teeth appears to be another feather in Trents increasingly large cap. <br /> <br />One thing that is missing from this album compared to NIN's earlier work (partricularly the Fragile) is the notable lack of experimental tracks. To some people this is what makes Nine Inch Nails, but for the less hardcore fans this could prove to be a blessing in disguise for the album is a lot more accessible than previous works. <br /> <br />Standout tracks include the opening \\"All the love in the world\\" and \\"Everyday is Exactly The Same\\" which follow in the vein of \\"Hurt\\" & \\"Something I Can Never Have\\" as the albums slow melodies. The single \\"Bite The Hand That Bleeds\\" is by my opinion not one of the stronger songs on the album, but does have a poppy catchy feel to it. The best song for me is \\"Only\\" which has the potential 2 become a club classic, if it ever gets the airplay it deserves.

B0006A9FMI|5.0|The reviews that trash this DVD because of the idiotic Dreamworks production are accurate.  There is no English track, and the subtitles, too high up in the screen BTW, depict every lousy sound.  I almost did not buy it because the cover art suggested low quality animation, which would be plausible in a sequel.  I got it anyway because I loved the first GitS. <br /> <br />I was not disappointed.  This sequel is absolutely extraordinary.  The animation is breathtaking.  And as someone who is a fan-lite of animie with no in-depth knowledge of the art form, I must say I love the Japanese style of story-telling evident in this tale. <br /> <br />There are people out there browsing Amazon who are not animie-geeks. They deserve to be able to trust that the reviews will point them to quality films - particularly reviews from fans of this form of animation who should want people to see the good stuff. <br /> <br />So by all means point out the production flaws in the DVD so those who want to wait for a better disc can do so. [But remember: anyone who refused to buy the original Star Wars VHS tapes had to wait an awfully long time for the DVDs.  Personally, I would advise anyone who loves animation to see this movie, flawed DVD and all.] <br /> <br />My point, however, is that the Amazon rating stars are like headlines.  They shouldn't steer people away from a spectacular flick.

B00005JNDZ|5.0|I've seen several movies that were sequels but they were never better than the first movie. But for the first time with this movie I found the second better than the first one. If you have seen \\"THE DIARY OF BRIDGET JONES\\", you must see this one and if you haven't seen it. I would recommend you to start with that one so you can follow better the story. <br />This time the picture starts with a very happy Bridget (Rene Zellweger) who is deeply in love with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and that love is mutual. Everything goes perfect until Bridget and Mark have a fight that ends with the relationship because Bridget is jealous of Natasha (Mark's friend who is beautiful and rich) and because Mark is still very arrogant with her. After this appears once again Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is called to work with Bridget. The story goes to several places from this point and you can laugh very much and have a great time with this movie that also has a wonderful soundtrack featuring songs by Joss Stone, Mary J. Blige and Robbie Williams along others. <br />With the speacial features you can find a hilarious interview from \\"serious journalist\\" Bridget Jones and actor Colin Firth and alternative  beginnings, deleted scenes plus others.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This movie sucked big time and not in the way you want a vampire movie to suck either. Do yourself a favor and watch the Classic Universal Monster Movies instead.

0385510454|1.0|How incredibly disappointing!!  The premise of the book really intrigued me, intially.  The protaganist was serving a prison term when he unexpectedly receives a full Presidential pardon.  Of course, however, the government has a secret agenda.  The main character possesses international secrets that dare not be exposed.  So the CIA sets him free in Europe and then insidiouly leaks the news of his freedom to world leaders.  They then sit and wait to see which country will kill him first!  Sounds pretty good, right?  Well, he ends up wandering aimlessly around Europe for a good 200-250 pages.  Absolutely nothing of interest happens.  (He does find himself drinking some of the best European coffee, however.)  All of this monotony leads to a completely unbelievable, far-fetched ending.  I was hoping for so much more.  But the Grisham magic was nonexistent in this story.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is the greatest zombie movie ever made and if you've only seen the remake then you need to go back and watch this one.

B00069YDXU|5.0|Keith, shave your upper arms.<br /><br />Carl, leave your shirt on.<br /><br />Greg, stay away from food service table.<br /><br />If your a casual fan looking for something to watch just to \\"remember when\\", this is not a good DVD to buy.  If your a meticulous, detail oriented fan(ie: comic book guy on the Simpsons), same thing, not the DVD for you.  I know there has to be some quality video w/sound out there of ELP.  Maybe whoever owns it just doesnt want to spend the money to market it properly.  True, ELP fans have continually been ripped off by sub-par video & anthology after anthology, I can see why some fans are very critical of this set.  All that being said, a bad ELP is still better than most any other prog-rock bands.  I never got the chance to see them live so with all their \\"appearance\\" problems, they still rock to me!  As a previous reviewer said, they do look like they could care less about each other, but again, the music simply outshines even their own bad attitudes.  So, is it worth 15.00? You bet it is! Lets face it, what else have we got?....
B00004Y6O9|1.0|I don't understand \\"music fans\\" anymore. Newer Metallica stuff is awesome, it doesn't need solos. <br />Is the only reason people like this because of the fancy solos? <br />Solos are lame and fill up precious time in songs. <br /> <br />Liking a cd only for solos is like liking a movie only for the sex scences. <br /> <br />For a good metal cd, check out Metallica's St anger.
1577311523|1.0|Many years ago I went through a spell of compulsive thinking that was particularly acute and painful. One day, while I was in the grip of these tormenting thoughts, I walked into my garden. Suddenly I saw my cat jump on a small rodent. I immediately rushed to the rescue of the tiny animal. After I had delivered it and given my cat a good but useless scolding, I remembered my previous painful engagement with thought. To my utter astonishment, the problem and the thinking that went with it-- or rather had created it--had totally disappeared!<br /><br />This simple anecdote may serve to illustrate the main error of Eckhart Tolle's teachings. The mournful round of thoughts had come to an abrupt end not because I had tried to stop it, but because there was a sudden, unpremeditated gap in it, caused by an unexpected incident that had required all my attention. Now what Eckhart wants you to do is to bring about this change through effort, and he gives you tricks to achieve it. All this obviously implies a motive (putting an end to an unpleasant state), compulsion and time, all of which indicate that thought--the cause of all the mischief and misery--is still active. Instead of identifying with thought or resisting the now, what one is now doing is trying to disidentify oneself from it or to say \\"yes\\" to the now. This is another game by exactly the same actor.<br /><br />Therefore this path is not going to lead you very far. It is as simple as that.<br /><br />The book itself is written in very simple English and in a question and answer format. I noted that the author claims that his words, specially the repetitive parts of the book, can draw you into the nothingness from which they came. Maybe. What I have found is that the Power of Now is mostly very vapid prose full of cheap and hackneyed notions spiced up with a few Gospel and Zen quotes. The aim seems to be the \\"end of suffering\\", which makes enlightenment a kind of Ultimate Prozac. The author insists that it is something that is \\"felt\\" and speaks of the unending bliss resulting from residing in Being. All this seems too superficial, too epidermic to be true. And creates tremendous expectation. No wonder people start making superhuman efforts to be awake after reading the book. Unfortunately, when you try to force thinking to stop, it comes back at your throat with a vengeance. Remember the anecdote at the beginning of this review.<br /><br />If you are a serious spiritual seeker, I recommend J.Krishnamurti instead of E.T. See my own review of \\"Total freedom\\" for more information.<br /><br />Finally, let me tell you something: Eckhart Tolle sells photographs of his uninspiring face on his website. Five dollars for a view of his congested face absorbed in meditation or smiling at the disciple/customer. Isn't that enough to show the vulgarity of the whole thing?<br /><br />Move on, truth is not to be found here.is something that is \\"felt\\" and speaks of the unending bliss resulting from residing in Being.

B0000X61VE|5.0|I love this workout. I do my Hardcore Kickbox Circuit by Janis Saffel and Guillermo Gomez first for my cardio sessions and then I do the Cindy DVD, alternating the 2 workouts that are in it. It's an awesome workout, period. I didn't listen to all the negativity Cindy recieved because of her form. You decide you yourself, just look at how many stars people have given it. I highly recommend it.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|In order to truly love this movie, you need to have a higher intelligence than your average south park fan.  Even though the satir of america being the world's police is absolutely hilarious and well done, the real joy of this movie comes from the scenes and references to the play \\"Cats\\", the satire of their play \\"AIDS\\", the musical score, the lines from famous classic movies, and the list goes on.  If you can catch the many literary references thrown around in this movie, you can understand why its funny and why the writers threw them in. <br /> <br />While I may be a \\"fanboy\\" of matt stone and trey parker ever since their first movie \\"Cannibals! The Musical!\\", I can honestly say that this movie is much funnier for well cultured and read people than people who just like fart and poop jokes. <br /> <br />The movie is a kind of serious funny that many do not get, or even like for that matter.  There is also alot of dark comedy, and because dark comedy is not for everyone, not everyone will like this movie.  However, if you are not afraid of being offended, and believe me it could be much worse, then give this movie a look! <br /> <br />One of my favorites in years! <br />

0312983867|5.0|Stephanie Plum is at it again, in this eighth book by author Janet Evanovich. Hard Eight, continues the adventures of the wanna-be-intrepid bounty hunter Plum tries to find seven-year-old Annie Solder and her mother, Evelyn, who have disappeared. Evelyn's estranged husband, Steven is the shady owner of a dive bar, and he, too, is looking for his ex-wife and daughter, but they aren't the only ones.<br /><br />Plum takes on the case as a favor to her mother's neighbor, a woman she grew up living next door to, but whom she has few ties. Finding a missing child is hardly work for a Fugitive Apprehension Agent, but Stephanie feels obligated, as she learns that a child custody bond was signed by Annie's grandmother, and if the child and her mother are not recovered, she could lose her house.<br /><br />As she digs deeper into the case she discovers that, as always, somebody is angry at Stephanie Plum and wants her to disappear-for good. This book's villain is nastier than most, as he will stop at nothing to get what he wants from Evelyn and Annie. The only problem is, Plum has no idea what that might be, despite the fact he is convinced she knows.<br /><br />With her life on the line, Plum searches for the elusive Evelyn, and is forced to join up with the mysterious and sexy Ranger, who scares her to death because she is so attracted to him. She also needs the help of her on-again, off-again fianc&eacute; Trenton cop Joe Morelli. Tagging along with Stephanie is the irrepressible Lula, a former prostitute turned file clerk who fancies herself a bounty hunter, and a new sidekick, Evelyn's lawyer/Laundromat manager, who resembles the Pillsbury Doughboy.<br /><br />Evanovich has done it again, creating incredibly real characters, including the two sexy men who are vying for Stephanie's attention. You don't know which one to root for, which says volumes for Evanovich's writing ability. As usual, the humor is sharp and funny, in particular a scene where the hapless Plum is attacked by a gaggle of geese who want her Crackerjacks.<br /><br />Whether bemoaning her bad hair days, or losing her fourth set of handcuffs in a week, Plum manages to keep plugging along and keep the reader veering between horror and humor.<br /><br />I highly recommend Hard Eight, and encourage anyone who has not read the Stephanie Plum novels before to go back and start at the beginning.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|i consisder myself a big fan of soad, but i feel this album lags in a few departments. it might just be me but im not a fan of daron malakians voice, its a bit to squirrelly for me. its seem as if darons head got to big and he had a power trip. not only does he sing 3 times more than he did in the last album,but he seems to have made a point to put his name above serjs and is stepping up as the \\"lead man\\". i find his voice to be a distraction from the songs in this one. the harmonizing in this album is great but once again u can hear darons voice well over serjs.darons a great guitarist but he needs to shut his mouth a bit more and let serj do the singing.
B00003003R|5.0|The cd is amazing, and I doubt that it's recorded with a new band. The band was amazing live, and they could really jam.

I have concerts of GNR, and there is better stuff out there then this cd.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|I can not for the life of me figure out why people were so impressed with this movie. I had to work extra hard just to stay awake through it. Maybe you need to be British to get the comedy. I'll admit it. I was fooled by the trailer into thinking this was a good comedy movie. I was mislead by others who called this a epic horror movie. Sure it is a comedy movie if you like your comedy as dry as the Sahara desert. Of course it is a horror movie if listening to people covered in cheezy fake blood groan constantly sends chills down your spine. However, I will not mislead you when I say don't waste your money there are much better films out there then this.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I love Seinfeld. I think it's an education in people. Often, I relate to their lives. This isnt your cheesy,cosy,feel good show where everything happens for a reason and most things end good. This is Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld is the most effective and influencive of stand up comedians. I almost crack up each time looking at his dressing sense but then I understand it's the 90's. His observational skill is second to none. He has a soft corner for Elayne (Julia Dryfus) who's trademark \\"Get out of here's\\" leave me laughing.<br /><br />This show is made for the couch. It is the show to watch with people you don't get along with.

Notice the change in Jerry Seinfeld's accent and swiftness.<br /><br />Second Season,<br />The Pony Remark (Jerry kills his aunt by a comment)<br />The Busboy ( makes me smile with paranoid George)<br />The Baby Shower (A definite classic with the Russain cables guys and cosmo Kramer)<br /><br />The Jacket (The best episode in both the dvds. This one made me laugh so much I cried. It seems like a 35 minute comedy with all the action)<br /><br />The Statue (Incredibly funny, interesting new characters)<br />The Revenge (a classic Seinfeld...v.v.v.funny too)<br /><br />I think the second DVD contains a lot of episodes they never aired on the cable telivision.Owning these,I feel like a kid who just learnt what 5 bucks can do and later realises he has 200 bucks.<br />The absolute star of Season 2 are Kramer and Jerry and their association which is quite funny.<br /><br />I own the third season too but haven't given it a watch.George remains my favourite character owing to his (negative)humanity in general.<br /><br />Just so you know the following episodes are on the respective DVDS-<br /><br />First Season - The Seinfeld Chronicles,The Stakeout,The Robbery,Male Unbonding,The Stock Tip<br /><br />Second Season - The Ex-girlfriend,The pony remark,The Busboy,The baby shower,The Jacket,The Chinese Restaurant,The Phone Message, The Apartment,The Stranded,The Statue,The Heart Attack,The Revenge,The Deal<br /><br />Please note- The Stranded is hilarious too.<br /><br />Enjoy Seinfeld.-    First Season - The Seinfeld Chronicles,The Stakeout,The Robbery,Male Unbonding,The Stock Tip    Second Season - The Ex-girlfriend,The pony remark,The Busboy,The baby shower,The Jacket,The Chinese Restaurant,The Phone Message, The Apartment,The Stranded,The Statue,The Heart Attack,The Revenge,The Deal    Please note- The Stranded is hilarious too.

He did a really good job on this film too. actually both Jamie and Will did an excellent job in their characters. i noticed the both of them had to get beefed up for this one. i would love to see them in a remake of a real good movie, like \\"Some Like it Hot\\" or \\"The Fortune Cookie\\" or maybe an urban flavor version of \\"The Odd Couple\\".

If you don't get this album, your missing out BIG.
1582403589|4.0|Walking Dead is everything all the other reviewers have said.  It's original, it's intense.  It's bloody brilliant.  I would read every one if I could afford them all. <br /> <br />That being said, the reason I gave it 4 and the main reason I wrote a review is that this book, as a collection of works, is lacking.  I waited for 4 weeks (not from Amazon) thinking it was 10 issues, but was only 6 (okay that was my own fault).  But I had only gotten my hands on much later, scattered issues, and I thought that if it was so good so late, how it began must be spectacular.  It wasn't.  It's just as slow-paced as the rest.  It's a character story.   <br /> <br />So maybe I misled myself, but if you went about getting your hands on it the way I did, a word of caution: you do not need to read the first six to understand more of the world they're in and what happened on Z-day.  Except to know more about why everyone's so pissed off and sad, but that you can pretty much guess. <br /> <br />Also, there is no cover art in the trade.  The covers of each issue are one of my favorite things about this comic, and I haven't seen many trades without the individual covers.
B00000293E|4.0|I'm in the process of digitizing some of my old vinyl, and in poking through my collection, came across this one.  I hadn't listened to it in quite some time, and it didn't even have an inner sleeve!  Since there are no musician credits on the cover, I surfed on over here to Amazon hoping to discover same.  No luck, but I must say I am so glad I am revisiting this LP.  And I heartily agree with the other reviewer that if the CD sound quality suffers, it sure ain't because of the LP (or analog tapes).  There is a roomy, spacey sound here that is enticing...........now if I only knew who the fine musicians were on this thing!!

B000929AJQ|1.0|I have been a huge Reznor fan since he came on the scene back in the 80s. When he did a re-release of \\"The Fragile,\\" I didn't think he'd ever come out with a new album. \\"With Teeth\\" certainly is new, but it's not good. \\"Bite the Hand that Feeds\\" is the only \\"hit\\" that's going to come off of this CD or be played in the clubs. With Reznor, you can usually count on thought-provoking lyrics or at least some complex, thrashing tunes. \\"With Teeth\\" is without both of these. The music and lyrics are kind of light and lilty like those of, dare I say it, Elvis Costello or Billy Corigan. It says a lot, but it doesn't make a real point. Re-grouped groups like Velvet Revolver and Audioslave are at least staying closer to their indie-alt roots. If you want something to remind you of the good tunes from the late 80s, get Beck's new one.
B000002Q7Y|4.0|Kansas \\"Power\\" is full of really Good Music !! Early fans of Kansas will want to dismiss it. But they are wrong !! <br />Kansas is and always will be Kansas. No matter what line up they use. Steve Morse was a solid replacement for Livgren and it can easily be heard. Combine his talents with the likes of Ehart,Williams,Greer and Walsh and you have \\"Power\\"!! <br />Speaking of Steve Walsh, I want to say that in my humble opinion he is by far one of the best vocalist in Progressive Rock. He is very underated. The same could be said of drummer Phil Ehart who is a technical wizard behind his kit. <br />Phil Ehart is the executive producer behind this album which was recorded at the Castle \\"Franklin Tennesse\\" in 1986. The London Philharmonic parts were recorded at the famous Abbey Road studios. This Cd has been digitally remastered and provides the finest in audio quality. So \\"Play It Loud\\" for full effect. <br />The cover art is also worth a mention. It is stupendous !! <br />The song writing credits go to both Walsh and Morse who collaborate wonderfully. Lyrically speaking, Kansas knows the importance of combining Great lyrics about Life and Life situations with musical mastery. <br /> <br />The Powerful opening track: <br />Silhouettes In Disguise -- fast hard rocker. Driving guitar,bass and drums. A catchy sing along chorus and Walsh's trademark keyboards. A Morse speed metal guitar solo included. <br /> <br />Power -- I love the lyrics to this one along with the catchy chorus. Walsh delivers fine vocals and Phil Ehart backs him up with some tasty drum fills. <br /> <br />All I Wanted -- a typical Kansas Ballad. Excellent vocals !! The keyboard arrangements enhance the orchestral feel to this song. <br /> <br />Secret Service -- {my least favorite} gives off a very robotic vibe due in large part to the electric sounding drums and musical phrasing. You can hear the stomping bass and keyboard patterns of a robot on the prowl for our very souls. Is it the secret service ?Out to get us \\"Beware\\"!! <br /> <br />Were Not Alone Anymore -- Heavy Steve Morse influence. Fast uptempo progressive rock shuffle. Featuring great thumping bass guitar patterns,dynamic drumming and fast furious guitars. <br /> <br />Musicato -- an instrumental that starts with a drum cadence style roll pattern added to some matching keyboards and bass. Phil Ehart gives us a taste of his double bass drum technique. Bass guitar is awesome. This song also features lots of intricate breaks and musical interlude passages. <br /> <br />Taking In The View -- a beautiful song with lovely acoustic guitars and a boys choir trio in the middle section of the song. There is a free flowing mix of emotion within. <br /> <br />Three Pretenders -- another Kansas power hitter. Williams is showcased with his excellent rhythmic chord strumming. Morse offers us his version of a fast explosive guitar solo. Very good background vocals. <br /> <br />Tomb 19 -- straight ahead rocker with a commercial flare to it. This should have recieved some air play. Bassist Greer cuts loose with some creative octave style fingering. Check out Eharts ride cymbal pattern and he also provides the ending with impressive drum fills. <br /> <br />Cant Cry Anymore -- a Kansas style ballad with Walsh at the helm. <br />A sad song about broken relationships. Walsh's heartfelt vocals let us know that nobodys to blame, it just happens. The Philharmonic orchestra completes this finale. <br />Sometimes we all just  \\"Cant Cry Anymore\\" <br /> <br />It's got power and feeling. Kansas \\" POWER \\"
B000089CJI|2.0|\\"Give Up\\" had a lot of potential from the start, but fell flat after a few tracks.  A couple of songs stand out (\\"Such Great Heights\\" and \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\") and are really great tracks, but the rest of the album could easily be mistaken for some guy sitting around a studio messing with the Super Mario Brothers soundtrack.   <br /> <br />Ben Gibbard, the lead singer, has a very weak, faint voice that sometimes makes you want to cringe, especially when it's in a somber setting, but all that changes when he gets a solid beat and catchy rhythm moving.  Unfortunately most of the tracks didn't provide the jolt he needed, so it's tough to get through the whole album without losing focus.
B000059H99|4.0|\\"Apollo Creed meets \\"The Italian Stallion\\". Sounds like a damn monster movie.\\"<br /><br />- Heavyweight Champ, Apollo Creed puts Rocky Balboa's destiny on the fast track in \\"Rocky\\"<br /><br />The ultimate underdog movie is arguably one of the best boxing films of all time.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is a down & out fighter, fighting in clubs at night, while being a leg breaker for a loanshark during the day.<br /><br />But, when a fight promoter comes looking for him to spar against the Heavyweight Champion of The World, Apollo Creed, Rocky gets \\"a million-to one shot\\", not to spar with the champ, but, to go toe to toe with him in the ring & a shot at the Heavyweight Title.<br /><br />With the help of his new manager, Mickey Goldmill, & a new girlfriend, Adrian, Rocky has nothing to lose & goes for it.<br /><br />\\"Rocky\\" is a great film filled with memorable characters and great lines. Sylvester Stallone sold the rights to the film, to United Artists as long as he was guaranteed to play the title role (UA had Ryan O' Neil in mind for the role. Gross.) I can't imagine anyone else as Rocky except of course Stallone and his reward was a best picture oscar & nominee for best actor, as well as, the four sequels that followed.<br /><br />The Special Edition to \\"Rocky\\" that was released in the Spring of 2001 is the definitive edition to the movie. It contains archival footage of the boxing match, deleted scenes, a tribute Burgess Meredith, and trailers to five \\"Rocky\\" films.<br /><br />The re-release that came out a few weeks ago sucks. It only contains the widescreen version of the film with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. Talk about a T.K.O.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I saw this highly overrated piece of excrement the first week it came out.  I truly wanted to see what all the hype was about and base an honest opinion on it.  Now you know.  The only credit I'll give big Mike is that he's good at editing and juxtaposing stock footage and narrating his viewpoint over it.  That's so he can basically sell to the woefully uninformed masses his woefully ignorant and amateurish observations on what he perceives as the truth.  He's the definition of a hypocrite and ignorant fool rolled into one big ugly hairball of a subhuman being.  His pandering behaviour overseas is very shameful and insulting to all Americans.  I've been in the military for over eighteen years and believe me, he does not speak for the troops.  He only speaks for himself.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I dont understand why theres so many bad reviews, ive been a SOAD fan from the beggining and i think this is definately one of their sickest albums ever. <br /> <br />
068987474X|4.0|This book helped me dump my boyfriend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's really good for the girls to know when a guy is lying and scheming and this book safely guides you all the way. Please read it before you go out on that date.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|A brilliant album! Just as good as 'Toxicity' in my humble opinion. 'Question!' is my absolute favorite off the album and I am guessing it will become a single; Kind of reminiscent of 'Chop Suey!' in its orchestration. 'Viloent Pornography' and 'Sad Statue' topping out my top 3 tracks. 'BYOB' and 'Cigar' are well done too; The whole album displays the artistic and creative talents of this group and I really appreciate their work. They do things I would immagine would make most musicians cringe but they do it and make it work ( most of the time ). I guess that is what makes them stand out from the croud and have a very different and unique sound. I was not a fan of 'Steal This Album!' at all but loved 'Toxicity' and now 'Mesmerize'.
0553582445|3.0|this book was great.  <br />I loved it. <br />HOWEVER, it will ruin the entire liveship trilogy for no reason whatsoever. the spoilers add nothing to this story. <br />there should be a warning on the cover.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|umm the people who don't likke the cd obvisouvly don't like soad cause this is a work of art, steal this albumn wasn't to great but they came back with this. And darren is a good singer you people are just pretty retarded for thinking hes not, he makes stuff different and NOT repetitive. Yeah sooo go soad!!!!
0553582453|3.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. <br />However, it had one horrible flaw: <br />this is not a novel, it's just the middle of a story. Until now, all of Hobb's book had a real conclusion, and could be read as stand-alone novels. This one does not. <br />It has no resolution. All of the strings are untied. It's as if Hobb hit 800 pages and said, \\"OK, let's start on book three\\". <br />This is unacceptable. <br /> <br />Also, this book continues the tradition of superfluous spoilers for the entire \\"liveship trader\\" series that started in \\"Fool's Errand\\". <br />DO NOT READ THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THE COMPLETE LIVESHIP TRILOGY.
B000929AJQ|2.0|if you're looking for the innovation of \\"pretty hate machine\\" or the emotional savagery of \\"broken,\\" you won't find it here.  even the aptly-titled \\"the downward spiral\\" held more appeal than this album does, and, for all its soundtrack-like variety, \\"the fragile\\" was much more listenable.<br /><br />it's as if old trent reznor is pulling a \\"depeche mode\\" on his fans -- we all know that the man is capable of creating wonderful music, but it seems as though his intent on making something new and different winds up steering his quality ever downward.<br /><br />i'm going to unload this cd at the local used cd store a.s.a.p., and wait for gary numan's upcoming \\"jagged halo\\" instead -- better to leave it to the man that started the genre to save it.  reznor may have contributed in his time, but i'll not be buying another nine inch nails album at the rate he's going.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This is an amazing concert. I was blown away. Freddie's voice was all around fantastic. He was a great performer, and it shows in this DVD. The special features are also very good. This is a must have for anyone who loves QUEEN.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Okay - the acting is excellent, the chemestry between the two leading actors is wonderful, the camerawork is supurb, and the message gets across beautifully. <br /> <br />Given a plot, this could have raised a mediocre plot into a wonderful movie.  With no plot at all, they merely frustrated me - this much work into telling a story should be spent on a story worth the effort. <br /> <br />If you're prepared for mood without story, you'll like this flick.  If you want some story with your mood, you'll be disappointed.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Well I've been a fan od SOAD since their first CD - before most people even heard of them before. Toxicity was a terrific followup to a flawless debut, and Steal this albumn was great too. So when I heard BYOB on the radio, and Cigaro, I was like \\"sweet! Looks like it's time for another killer SOAD cd!!!\\" <br /> <br />Boy has this CD dissapointed! The songs are just lackluster, and don't offer the same interest or songwriting as before. Less aggression (except for maybe 3 songs)...and more singing. I'm not against singing more, but it's just not what I want to hear from SOAD. <br /> <br />Anyway...I didn't like their other cd's upon first listen...so MAYBE I'll like this one more in the future, but I've listened to it about 5 or 6 times, and it's subpar. <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|This is by far the worst band i've ever heard. But this is a great blueprint on how to be a really lame and annoying band. Lets look at this and examine how we, too can suck. God awful lyrics: Check! My 11 year old brother asks what idiot wrote these stupid lyrics. Where else can i find songs that mention Tony Danza. Bad vocals: Check! we've got that! Do you want those bad lyrics delivered with the vibrato of a billygoat who over-inunciates or how about the guitarist who shrieks like a little girl or a 10th grade boy whos barely gone through puberty? Well, you dont have to pick! we got both! Laughable music: Check! Armenian wedding music with distortion is the foundation upon which our witty delivery is laid! Got an an unused riff that sounds like a child wrote it? oh, dont toss it aside!! Donate it to this band! The worse the better!     I guess its just me....  wait, no. its not. its you. Hey, Just move this band over to the comedy section and i'll consider it honest advertising. Otherwise, Don't try to cram this garbage down my throat and tell me it \\"rocks\\". Haha. This band should have rocks thrown at them.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I haven't seen anything this disturbing since \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Darren Aronofsky's film is an unflinching look at the ultimate degradation that drug abuse/addiction brings to the principal four characters.<br /><br />The cast is phenomenal - especially Ellen Burstyn, who was robbed by the Academy voters, and who gives a heartfelt and courageous and hearbreaking performance. Marlon Wayans was an amazing surprise - I had never seen him in a dramatic role before and he was brilliant.<br /><br />There are so many disturbing moments from this film that still stick with me four years later.(Hey, it's been four years and I still can't forget so many of the images).<br /><br />This film doesn't have an explicit antidrug message - it simply shows what happens when nature takes its course as the characters become increasingly owned by drugs.<br /><br />The edition of Hubert Selby's novel that I have has a dedication/forward that refers to divine love as the only<br /><br />real \\"pound of pure\\" (see the movie).<br /><br />See this movie. Have your older kids see it. It is hard to watch in spots but you won't be able to look away.
B00080ZG10|1.0|Over-acted.  Little information on Howard's involvement with aviation.      Howard Hughes was an odd duck, but I didn't need to see another movie focused on his quirkiness.  A documentary-style movie, showcasing Howard's aviation feats, would have been preferable to me.
B000068FY0|5.0|OK, I love this album; I first heard it as a 15-year-old in 1975, and played it endlessly - it's THAT album for me.     Those of you who only know the band from Breakfast In America are missing something important. This is one of the most perfectly constructed, played and produced albums of the 70's. It bears comparison with Dark Side of the Moon without question: and it is a great deal less angst-ridden.     Get this, and listen to it. \\"Breakfast\\" is light, sugary-sweet by comparison. From the opening, unforgettable harmonica solo, to the fading chords of the last track, this is proper music, played for intelligent listeners, and not with the radio or the charts in mind. All the songs are through-composed, all impeccably arranged and played, and that production is astonishing. Listen to the drums on 'If Everyone Was Listening'. Or the Wurlitzer solo on 'School'. Or... I could go on and on. For the perfect blend of musicianship, accessibility and adherence to exacting standards, it is very, very hard to find anything that could compete with this record.
B0008ISM40|4.0|I've just listened to this album a few times in my car, then on my PC while browsing around and wasting time, and I just finished intently listening to it several more times.  I believe this album will have things both long-time NIN fans and casual listeners will enjoy.    I've been a fan of NIN since I was first exposed to Pretty Hate Machine by a friend in High School.  A year or so after hearing that, Downward Spiral was released.  I don't believe any musician made me feel the way Reznor did with his words and aggressive music, punctuated by the occassional slow and dark melody.  The songs spoke to my feelings of being outcast and incomplete.    Then Fragile was released while I managed a record store in St. Louis.  Despite the hype, and many hard core fans being dissappointed, I liked it.  I felt it was a more mature outlook on things, it seemed that Trent and I had both done some growing up.    With Teeth sounds much like Fragile musically, with moments of soft industrial rythm to aggressive percussion. However the lyrics grabbed me to a greater degree than the Fragile had.  Though the music is different, some of the lyrics remind me of Pretty Hate Machine. (I said SOME, others remind me of Fragile..don't freak out on me) Many of the songs speak of love (not the flowers and puppy kind) and how it affects you.  And like the good old days of a pimple-faced me holed up in my bedroom listening to NIN, the songs made me reflect on myself and how I felt.  NO album has been able to do this to me in years.  I've recently started a graveyard shift job, still work a few hours in another job, and been planning my wedding.  Over the past year of stress and drama, this album has come up from under the noise to really get to me.  I honestly feel more understanding of myself after hearing Trent's words.  And that's no exaggeration.    The songs 'The Hand that Feeds' and 'Every Day is Exactly the Same' both have a distinctive feeling of being isolated and cut off.  They reallyspoke to me at this point in my life. 'The Hand' in particular has an old style throw-your-fist-in-the-air rebelliousness without regressing to something that makes me feel like a kid.    The songs that have an honest reference to love, like 'All the Love in the World' and 'Sunspots', are very good.  They are the kind of love songs that I like to hear.  They reflect the more mature Trent that has grown up with us since Downward Spiral.  What?  Industrial love songs?  Yes they exist and nobody does it better than Trent.  His matured love songs from Fragile and With Teeth make me reflect on my fiance.  Trent's songs of love are honest and realistic.  They remind you that person has a profound effect on you for the better.    Some of the songs sounded a little poppy at first, 'Only' in particular.  However they grew on me, mostly because of the lyrics.    The last song 'Right Where it Belongs' is a slow and dark piano-accented finale.   I feel it has some of the best lyrics to come from Reznor in a while.  'Every Day is Exactly the Same' is a runner up for lyrics that moved me the most.    All in all, this NIN album has a bit for everyone.  It has pulsing industrial anthems, aggressive rock, and dark melodies that will move you.  However, if you can get past whatever you think about the music, whether you wish it was like the older NIN or more like the Fragile, the lyrics are what sold me on this album.  NIN has always been the best industrial band, not just because the music was provacative, but because Trent's messages were always there and at the core of it all.    Put everything aside and listen to what Trent has to say, he might more know about how you feel than you think he does.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Her second greatest hits  collection. Madonna re-invented herself and also her music very often in the 90's. This album isn't a greatest hits album, it's a collection of Madonna's favourite songs. For example, why Drowned World is included??? It wasen't a hit at all. And why American Pie, 8 weeks n1, isn't included??? This is sad, because it should have been an 18-track CD. My ideal order would be: <br />1. This Used To Be My Playground <br />2. Erotica <br />3. Deeper And Deeper <br />4. Rain <br />5. I'll Remember <br />6. You'll See <br />7. Bedtime Story <br />8. Secret <br />9. Take A Bow <br />10. Don't Cry For Me Argentina <br />11. Ray Of Light <br />12. Frozen <br />13. The Power Of Good-Bye <br />14. Beautiful Stranger <br />15. Music <br />16. Don't Tell Me <br />17. What It Feels Like For A Girl <br />18. American Pie <br />But this isn't the order, to bad. Also, no new songs are included. But that's not bad, since it a greatest hits collection and not a new album. <br /> <br />Well, anyway, this album is great! It goes from Madonna sex-period till the cowgirl days. The album starts with the hilarious Deeper and Deeper that brings you to the dancefloor and is followed by Erotica, with strong beats and deep lyrics. Track 3 is Human Nature, and idn't good at all. It does have great beats but that's it. It's Madonna reaction against the public after her erotic days. She says 'Oops...I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex' but later 'I'm not sorry, it's human nature, I'm not your b**ch don't hang your s**t on me.' The sentence with bad language is left out, which ruines a part of the song! Secret is a guitar song that becomes better with time. It has a good melody. Then, Don't Cry For Me Agentina was made for the movie Evita and shows Madonna's beautiful voice. It is a very sad song that can be played when someone dies.  <br /> <br />Bedtime Story is a sensual song that hasen't got a melody at all. It's quite boring and wasen't a hit. Still, it's very original and belongs to this compilation. After all, it was a titel track. The Power Of Good-Bye is a ballad from her bext album yet, Ray Of Light, and includes nice special effects, a WOW-melody and strong vocals. One of the best ballads ever made by Madge! Beautiful Stranger, for the movie Austin Powers is a funny and catchy song with a disco-beat and a youthfull Madonna. Frozen is a mystical song, just like the video. The 'Mmmmmmmm' sounds amazing. You can dream away when you hear this song. Take A Bow is a great ballad without Madonna singing high notes. It is relaxing.  <br /> <br />When you hear Ray Of Light for the first time you will think: 'What the hell is this?' But after more listenings you will like it better and better. It is very, very modern and includes al the latest special effects and crazy sounds. Madonna sings extremely high and it is a song where you can shake your ass. It is rock pop, you can bang your head when you hear it! A very powerfull song! Don't Tell me is a simple guitar song but very danceable and catchy. Madonna's vocals sound natural.What It Feels Like For A Girl has a funky touch and a classic melody. Still, it is hard to dance on it. Drowned World is very boring but becomes a rock-pop song at the end!!! The album finishes with the best song of the whole compilation! Music gets funkier every time you hear it. The lyrics are very simple though, but it doesn't matter at all. You can really boogie-woogie on this song! <br /> <br />So, this album is a mix of many different kinds of pop music. It's not pop alone. It's also a bit R&B and rock. it it a poor compilation, because it doesn't include all her big hits and almost all songs are edited or shortened. But if you haven't got her albums where these songs belong, then you will love this album, It's a must have!!! This is classic pop that is timeless. 4 stars! <br />
B0002KVULG|5.0|There never has been nor will there ever be a Dracula quite like the one portrayed by Frank Langella in this film.  Mr. Langella exudes sensuality through every pore of his body.  From the first scene where he has been tossed onto the beach after a shipwreck,  we see him slowly moving his hand out of his coat sleeve to gently grasp the hand of the young lady (Mina) who finds and rescues him.  Just this simple movement is sooooo sexy.  This man's eyes, voice and body language is full of sexuality and you have no trouble believing that women would be more than willing to lie down and remove any obstacles from their neck so they could receive his bite.  This film is actually very erotic. The music is fantastic and definitely plays a roll in creating this intense sensual feeling.  This is true throughout this film.  You still feel this major attraction to Dracula with the last flap of his cape.  You find yourself wanting this gorgeous \\"monster\\" to win every altercation.  What fun....You are in a whole different place and just become totally involved with the romance of it.  This is actually a very romantic film.    I was sorry to read the editor's view listed above.  It's almost like I saw a whole different movie.  I LOVED IT!!!  Please do yourself a favor and see this film.  If you don't buy it (you'll be sorry) at least rent it.  I was sorry when it ended.  I could've watched this all night and still wanted more.
B0000028MA|5.0|This soundtrack speaks for itself.  From what is easily my favorite era of music, comes the Singles soundtrack. Call it grunge, call it alternative, call it whatever you want.  Two of the best Pearl Jam songs ever recorded (that aren't even on Lost Dogs) are on this disc.  That is worth the price alone.  Not to mention some Cornell, Pumpkins (the lengthy version you won't find on their greatest hits) and other greats from this fantastic movie (High Fidelity for the early 90's).  Now I have to take a deep breath as I try to describe in words what Mother Love Bone's Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns does to me when I hear it.  In fact, it isn't even worth trying.  You have to listen for youself
B00005JNTX|5.0|Opens up with a rooftop scene with a man and a woman...Josh Hartnett (Wicker Park) who plays a assassin and Marley Shelton (Valentine) who he kills. Then we get into more and more gritty, bloody, brutal and knockout hardcore stuff with 3 intermingling stories. Goes to Hartigan,played by a always rock solid Bruce Willis (Hostage), who rescues an 11 year old girl from the hands of a rapist, played by Nick Stahl (Bully) but Hartigan ends up on the recieveing end of a bunch of bullets landing him in the hospital. The first has Mickey Rourke(Once Upon A Time In Mexico) in a very very good comeback peformance as Marv who's love Goldie, played by Jaime King (Pearl Harbor) was killed by a silent assassin/cannibalistic psycho named Kevin, played with silent creepiness by Elijah Wood (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). Marv finds out that Goldie has a twin sister named Wendy, also played by Jaime King. So, Marv goes on a brutal killing spree in which he slices and dices everyone who gets in his path and ends up in a showdown with Kevin Boy. The electric chair scene was crazy!! Next up we follow shiny red converse wearing Dwight, played by a dynamic Clive Owen (Closer) who gets involved with a waitress named Shelly, played by Brittany Murphy (Little Black Book) and the corrupy cop named Jackie Boy, played by a insanely terrific Benicio Del Toro (The Way Of The Gun). Jackie Boy and his goons all get killed by some vicious hookers, led by Gail, a juicy Rosario Dawson (Alexander). They figure out that they killed a corrupt cop. My favorite scene in this whole movie would have to be when Dwight (Owen) is driving with a dead Jackie Boy (Del Toro)in the passenger seat and suddenly Jackie Boy starts to talk to him. The scene flips from different colors and that's the scene in which Quentin Tarantino special guest directed. Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) and gang kidnap Gail (Dawson) for the head of Jackie Boy and it ends up in a major bloodbath. The last one is the rest of Hartigan's (Willis') story where he goes to jail for something he didnt do and when he is let go he goes in search of a fully grown up Nancy Callahan, played by the delicious Jessica Alba (Honey) and he has to save her from the treacherous clutches of The Yellow Bastard who was the rapist (Nick Stahl) in which he saved little Nancy from before and Willis \\"litterally\\" punches The Yellow Bastard's brains in and rips off his other head as well. Josh Hartnett is also at the end, like in the beginning, playing the same man/assassin as he appears in an elevator with hooker Becky, played by Alexis Bleidel (Gilmore Girls). Also starring Michael Madsen (Kill Bill 1 and 2), Devon Aoki (D.E.B.S.), Nicky Katt (Suburbia), Powers Boothe (Frailty), Rutger Hauer (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Carla Gugino (Spy Kids Trilogy) and Frank Miller himself is in this...he's the preist whom Marv (Rourke) kills. Fast, ferocious and better then the crap that's been coming out for the past couple of months...although I liked Constantine. Frank Miller fans...trust me, you wont be disappointed...a knockout masterpiece.  <br />
0881030376|4.0|John Steinback is famous for writing book that took place during the Great Depression. Steinback's book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is about two men, Lennie and George ,trying to reach their dream of \\"living off of the fat of the land\\", in other words they want to own their own land, be their own boss. While trying to reach this goal they run into many problems. Lennie has a problem of touching soft things such as rabbits, and he ends up doin some bad things at Weed and at the new ranch. <br />   In my opinion I didn't like this book alot because John steinback likes to describe the setting and i couldn't really picture it very much. Also, the ending of this book was very tragic and sad. I would recommend this book to any age because its a classic story that many people have loved and still rememeber after they read it.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I must admit, when I first heard \\"cigaro\\", I thought that this new album would suck. Every great band has some bad albums... Pink Floyd knows this better then anyone, but I was plesantly suprised. While shorter (yes, I know its a two part thingy) then the others, it is truly great. Not as heavy as Toxicity, Not as slow as \\"steal this album\\", not as... uh... Random as the self titled, This album stands as an entity all to itself. The highpoints? All but Cigaro, but come on, I'd rather hear Cigaro a million times then \\"the Reason\\" once... that song... everytime I hear it, i get this uncontrolable urge to shoot the band and throw myself off a cliff. ANYWAY, what makes system of a down so great? Lets see. Nothing sounds like System. They are probably closer to Zappa then Slipknot, in mindset. What makes them different? They all sing, they have *gasp* Good lyrics, funny and angry at the same time, amazing drumming, bass and guitar, The Sheer joy of hearing metal sung in a falsetto, the attention to detail, the courage it takes to make a song like \\"radio video\\", with hints of polka and reggae, while staying metal. The Eastern influence on the music... No one sounds like System, and Even if they tried, No one would pull it off. This band is truly original, and I have a feeling they'll be sticking around for while, long after hoobastank dies. Which cant come soon enough. I do have an issue with how it was mixed though. The drums are barely there! John is a very good drummer, but it doesnt show like it did on toxicity, or thier self titled. There needs to be a remastered edition, with louder drums  My only real complaint is that, just like you have heard, Daron seems to take control. While he holds up amazing backing vocals on thier first three, and then some, He goes a little overboard here. Serj is clearly a much better vocalist, and should stick to lead. I hope we see more of him on Hypnotize. But from the thrash metal of \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\"to the death metal polka ska of \\"Radio Video\\" to the best song on the album ( in this humble teenagers opinion) The soaring \\"Question!\\", System proves that they are Popular without being mainstream, System proves that they are truly the defining voice in metal, or popular music for that matter, in the world today.    Stay Out of the Daylight!    Isaac
B00004X01U|3.0|Madonna returned to the charts in September. It didn't seem that far away though since American Pie, because it was a huge hit outside the US. Her album before, Ray of Light was a huge succes so there were many expentations for this new album! Madonna was already famous for re-inventing herself then, so it would be a surprise what the album will be like. I decided to buy Music very soon after it was released, since I expected a good album after Ray Of Light. Especially because I saw William Orbit produced again with her together wit Mirwais. Well, let's see: <br /> <br />The album starts with the very funky titel track. Probably the best song of the album. It becomes funkier and catchier everytime you hear it. The lyrics are as simple as they can be, but it doesn't matter that much. It's a classic dance song, spending 12 weeks at n1 on the world chart. And it really deserved those weeks. Madonna proved she still knows how to boogie-woogie. The funkyness continous with Impressive Instant, a song that isn't easy to love. Again, a bit kiddish lyrics (I like to singy singy singy like a bird on the wingy wingy wingy) but again the song is already original enough itself. Madonna shows she can make new original music. Track 3, Runaway Lover, should have fitted better on Ray of Light, it's a techno song with an original beginning and ending. After more listenings you will probably love it.  <br /> <br />Track 4 (I Deserve It) is the first time when Madonna slows down. The guitar matches her voice well, it sounds very pure. The lyrics are repeatable. Track 5 is Amazing and sounds like Beautiful Stranger. However, this song is funkier and has strong beats. It's a very girly song! Then a trance techno ballad follows, which becomes worse everytime you hear it. Howver, the song is pretty original. And it0s amazing how you Madonna combines trance with a ballad. Her voice is edited and doesn't sound that nice. It's not a song that you will listen often to. <br /> <br />In Don't Tell Me the acoustic guitar appears for the second time, it's a good mid-tempo song. You can dance well on it, just like Madonna did in the video. It's pretty simple but it will never bore you. The next track is What It Feels Like For A Girl. Madonna's vocals sound really good and it has again some kind of funkyness. The melody is a classic but the song isn't. It's hard to dance on it. Paradise For Me is a relaxing ballad with again a funky touch to it. Madonna sings a bit French and the song gets better in the last 2 minutes, when a great background melody is added. It's a special, magical song. <br /> <br />In track 10 the guitar appears again. When you hear the song you think that you are in the Western and relaxing. The song is very simple, and one of the worst of the album. FInally, American Pie, a cover of Don McLean's classic. Madonna totally changed the song, I think it sounds better now and I am happy with this cover. She turned a bit boring guitar song into a funky pop song with great vocals of Madonna and the chopel. <br /> <br />So, I am happy with Music. The album dowsn't flow well because Madonna worked with 2 producers. The album doesn't really have a theme. It includes funky songs, guitars and techno. Also, the album has a quite short running time. Still, this is a good album with mostly above avarage songs. It could have been better, but it really wasen't a waste of my money. Madonna showed she still got it.
B000002UAO|5.0|I find Rubber Soul shines in almost every aspect as a studio album, and that was the real accomplishment for this album. Now to review some of the music.<br /><br />We begin a great catchy tune, Drive My Car. A nice kick start to this impressive album, with a hard based rock style to it. Moving on, we get some lyrically beautiful songs, including You Won't See Me, a very likeable song, and in essence, I found it to be very representative of The Beatles as a band. More great music follows, as Nowhere Man is a strong, very lyrically  driven thing of beauty. A very impressive guitar solo as well compliment this track. Think For Yourself is overall very consistent lying among the group of songs on Rubber Soul, and, of course, it is great. Michelle is the typical ballad, with the glorious melody of the song, and John Lennon sending us to heaven with the lyrical delivery. Carries similarities to Yesterday, of the album Help! The album picks up its pace again with What Goes On, and I essentially found this to be a lowpoint of the album. It really isn't a very memorable song for me. Nevertheless, I enjoy listening to it. I'm Looking Through You seems to drive the album forward again, with heavier guitar riffs then usual constructed nicely around a catchy chorus. Another melodic song comes with In My Life, reflecting past times. A well written song, with a nice flow. The album finishes nicely, highlighted with Run For Your Life, lyrically exceptional, and the guitar melody is perfect.<br /><br />Pyschedelia really wasn't present at the point of this release for The Beatles, and they kept their sound barriered. This is not in any way a criticism, however, I myself prefer the psychedelic sounds that they conveyed with Revolver. I am personally not a big fan of The White album though. Therefore  this should be the one Beatles release that no one can complain about. This album is quite simply beautiful music, for most people, that's all that's important. So, to conclude, I highly recommend this is as one of the prime Beatles purchases, and along with Rubber Soul, I will highly recommend Revolver(my personal favourite), Abbey Road, Help!, Sgt. Peppers, and Magical Mystery Tour.his is as one of the prime Beatles purchases, and along with Rubber Soul, I will highly recommend Revolver(my personal favourite), Abbey Road, Help!, Sgt.

B000929AJQ|3.0|Same Trent Reznor..  It was great back in the day but nothing really crazy on this one.. It does have a few good songs though.. If you like lots of distortion this is the cd for you! I think the closer days are gone.. Maybe Im getting old...
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chobsky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower  is a coming of age story about a High School Freshman Charlie, and his Senior friends. It describes the trials and tribulations of growing up as a modern teenager. I liken this book to Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. The main difference, is Chobsky uses the idea of letters to a pen-pal to portray his message, while Salinger uses the more traditional method of storytelling.  <br />        The Perks of Being a Wallflower deals with issues that include: rape, drug use, being homosexual in American society, Teenage sex, pregnancy, and a score of others. Due to this, I highly encourage people to read this book.   <br /> I would recommend this book for not only Jr. High and High School students, but parents of these students. The situations that Charlie go through are realistic, but the likelihood of all of them coinciding are remote. The book is a relatively short read, it only took me a couple of hours.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|too short. too repetitive. but still good cause it's system. daron needs to concentrate on playing guitar instead of singing.
B00003CX9E|1.0|It's beyond any word to describe how bad Citizen Kane is. Having been heard the hype \\"the greatest film ever\\", I decide to see and keep waiting for the good stuffs to come up but it never does. Don't be a victim of this fraud!  <br />
B000006TSC|5.0|On Breathless, you can begin to sense that Bardens and Latimer are going in different directions in their musical vision. But much like the Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\" the divergence expands the group. (In this analogy, Richard Sinclair's \\"Down on the Farm\\" is Ringo's \\"Octopuses Garden\\"). In particular, the songwriting seems to be stronger, albeit less collaborative. The instrumentation for the band was never tighter, and Mel Collins' studio contributions are tremendous.  <br /> <br />There is less of a cohesive feel than on some previous Camel albums, and a greater concentration on individual songs, but it tends to make each of the songs stand out a little more because of it. <br /> <br />Highly recommended
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|\\"Mezmerize\\" is, without a doubt, a spectacular album. System of a Down is back with their brand of faced pased, brain-pouding music that sounds like the band has moved beyond the need for mere musical talent, opting instead for releasing a twisted, schitzophrenic psyche through the instruments. Musically, this album is sound, and although not quite as melodic as Steal This Album, it's highly reminiscent of Toxicity and the original debut in its speed and style. It's true that it's short, as the band allegdges it's only half of a Hypnotize/Mezmerize duo (Hypnotize is due out this fall).  <br /> <br />The only problem to be noted is the lyrical style. It's fairly simplistic. On many of the songs, System of a Down appears to have resorted to mindless reptition of a few lines within the songs. Don't get me wrong: the lyrics are different from song to song, and the style of singing changes to, as Daron Malakian (the guitarist) plays a larger vocal role. However, within a song, things can be a bit repititious at times. The exceptions are B.Y.O.B. and Lost in Hollywood. In case you haven't heard it, that first one is enough to make every other band played near them on the radio sound lazy and slow. The second song is more melodic, vaguely reminiscent of Spiders. <br /> <br />Mezmerize is a great album, and fun to listen to. My only gripes are that lyrical issue mentioned above, and the short length. Not that the lyrics thing is even that bad. With Serj and Daron being on the SOAD ball, you can barely understand them most of the time. <br /> <br />Unless you listen really, really quickly.
0671004107|5.0|Like a lot of Sagan's work, Contact is really about the place of humanity, and life, in the greater reality of the universe.  Are we a random accident of nature or is there a more fundamental meaning behind our existence? <br /> <br />As a novel Contact is an entertaining, but sometimes cumbersome, read.  The payoff is a brilliant little twist at the end, completely absent in the movie.  It is original, delightful and a complete surprise, and by itself it raises a pretty good book onto my short list of personal favorites. <br /> <br />Some readers won't get it, or won't get the significance of it, but those who are fascinated by the big questions and reasonably literate in scientific/mathematical thinking, will stumble upon a hidden little gem here.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I just got the DVD yesterday, and expected to see something of the scene alluded to by Parker and Stone between (then Pres. candidates) George Bush and John Kerry. In a word, NO... it is not on the DVD. I saw two different versions at the theater, and this is what was originally released. The 2nd time I saw the movie the love scene with Gary and Lisa was cut in half. The DVD has the full version. <br /> <br />The movie was great, even more laughs than before because now you can slow down and go back and see for yourself... but the Special Features offer more viewing pleasure than the movie. The wealth of hidden objects in every and I do mean EVERY scene are exactly what they tell you in the feature... you will sit up with the DVD ALL NIGHT LONG finding them. There are HUNDREDS of things hidden in the background.. marijauna plants for trees, palm trees made out of dollar bills, the list is almost endless. <br /> <br />The technical work of evolving, manipulating and filming the puppets and all the supporting model work is fabulous and worth the price of the DVD alone. I looked forward to buying this one for a long time, and it is a home run.
B000002H2H|5.0|Forget everything new by Metallica. Most people who hate them have only heard the recent, mainstream garbage they have released. THIS is the reason they become so popular in the first place. This is one of those rare albums where I actually like every single song. Personal favorites go to Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Creeping Death and the creepy, instrumental masterpiece Call of Ktulu. There is enough speed in here to satisfy the thrasher and enough melody to please the more technical metal head. This is one of the main sources of where heavy metal originated from and it is easy to understand why. Too bad Metallica's reign ended with the black album, but as for Ride the Lighting, it is a shining beacon of Metallica's fady glory.
B0007GAERG|5.0|And power is what Mariah aka Mimi has delivered.  This CD proves that you can't keep true talent down. Mariah is back with another hit on her hands with THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI.  Packed with some heavy hitters such as Snoop, Pharrell, Nelly, Twista, Jermaine Dupri, Kanye, The Neptunes, Trey Lorenz *whew* (Who'd I miss?)whether they were featured, provided background vocals, co-wrote, (Mariah can write!) produced or what have you, this was bound to be on point.  <br /> <br />The first track IT'S LIKE THAT is a very hot party in the club number.  WE BELONG TOGETHER (my personal favorite) has a  slow tempo with lyrics reflecting on a broken heart. This song is so beautiful, not because of the pain of a break up, but because Mariah delivers such a convincing flavor to it.  The song MINE AGAIN is another great one, a song that makes you reminisce. <br /> <br />For Mariah fans...SHE'S BAAAAACK!  Even if you're not a fan, you will find tracks on here that will make you change your mind. <br /> <br />There's no stopping Mariah....IT'S LIKE THAT Y'ALL!! <br />

B000001EUL|5.0|This recording is great with the new remastered version. Never owned the old one, but I am very happy with the sound quality. It's not harsh or tinny like most modern recordings.
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service snuck up on me out of nowhere and infected my brain. The more I listen to this CD, especially when I can really listen and become absorbed, through whatever means, the more I wish I could throw my filthy money at these guys. I want more! <br />The lyrics are unexpected and original, painting a very clear and emotionally tangible experience, surrounded by (usually) upbeat and interesting (not played out) electronics. I detect hints of IDM influences, as well as 80's new wave (the few good parts!), with a perspective and sincerity that is refreshing in todays predictable mainstream music scene.   <br />I wish I could promise you will love this CD, but...I dont know you. My advice, buy it and listen to it when you can actually listen, and with a good sound system or earphones.  <br />A+! When's the next album coming?! <br />
B0007P0LO8|4.0|To my very surprise this DVD is already for sale in the Netherlands where I bought it yesterday, 18th May 2005, whereas it is not yet released in the USA. That said, I already owned the earlier release and had hoped that they would have remastered the film for DVD. Alas, they did not, although they put the sound on DTS 5.0 which I am not yet able to listen to, which is the only difference compared to the DVD I already owned. (I think the sound might be great on DTS, but I do not know for now).    I think the singing on this DVD is superb and impeccable (I am a big fan of Domingo and Frenis pianissimos are the most beautiful you will ever hear). But the film looks as if somebody put it directly from VHS tape unto DVD (which is probably the case if I am to guess) which is a shame, seeing as the price I paid would have suggested that they did some work on it.     Five stars for the singing and three for the quality of the DVD (and shame on all the big companies for daring to sell us this kind of quality), makes for the four stars given.
0395925037|4.0|Not at all what I expected. I expected a monster spouting hate and ignorance. Instead, I found a very well written autobiography. Hitlers writing style has a lot of flavor to it, and the stories are very intriguing, particularly the ones about his youth and the time he lived in Vienna. What is interesting to me is that he tells his story the way he saw it whether it benefits him or not. He freely admits his faults, as well as his strengths. For example, his sadness at being rejected from art school when, in his mind, he thought he was a very good painter. Or, when he admits his lack of understanding of how labor unions work when confronted by co-workers on a construction site. It is a very interesting book. It is a good study of one particular persons version of sociology.
B000687M48|3.0|OK we know they are decent enough on cd,but can they pull it off live?Yes and No.I seen them live before this DVD came out and honestly it was awful,The guitars were way too loud to the point of amy lee literally screaming to be heard over the mic.So i was curious to see if this was any different or if they so just suck live.After watching it i was sure of 2 things.1.They need a better sound engineer and 2.Amy has a hell of a voice.As i found when i seen them live the guitars were overly loud and out of key which led to amy singing out of key occasionally(which is no fault of her own),But when it came to the ballads it was gorgeous,that woman has a beautiful voice now if only she had the oppurtunity to use it more often.My decision is if you havent seen them live yet grab the DVD/cd if you have grab it anyway and compare the 2 yourself.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|After the jaw-dropping musical achievements of their debut album and Toxicity, and even some parts of Steal This Album, this new disc from SOAD is a disappointment of nearly crushing magnitude. The only consistently successful track here is the complex and brutally ironic antiwar dissertation \\"BYOB,\\" while a few other tracks like \\"The Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" and \\"Sad Statue\\" show interesting advancements in the SOAD approach. But otherwise we have recycled Iron Maiden riffs, rhythms that lack the military precision of SOAD's previous efforts, and so-called ironic lyrics that are becoming more incoherent than irreverent. And all SOAD fans should avoid \\"Old School Hollywood\\" like the plague - a song so bad it's bad, in which Daron Malakian whines about a celebrity baseball game in which he had to associate with Tony Danza and Frankie Avalon.<br /><br />The main problem here is that this is much less of a group effort, with Daron Malakian dominating the band's sound more and more. Malakian is obviously an outstanding songwriter and has steered the band's course successfully, but he is now building the songs increasingly around his guitar and vocal work, which are not nearly as unique or accomplished as his songwriting. Bassist Shavo Odadjian barely establishes presence on this album, and drummer John Dolmayan has been subdued dramatically (Dolmayan's maximalist work on Toxicity made him one of my favorite modern drummers). The greatest crime here is how Serj Tankian, whose frantic and serious-to-hysterical delivery has made him by far the most unique singer in current rock, has been reduced to handling just half of the lead vocals on this album, and has been pushed aside by Malakian's whiny and reedy singing. Despite any claims of building complex vocal arrangements, System of a Down does not need two lead vocalists, especially when one of them should stick to guitar and admit that he can't hold a candle to the real lead singer. Daron Malakian's reach is really exceeding his grasp, and he has reduced his talented bandmates to session lackeys. Watch for more upcoming side projects from the other three guys.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|In the past, SOAD's albums have had some incredibly brilliant musical and lyrical moments but have also had some very uneven moments.  It almost seemed like they wanted to take a more melodic, eclectic route from the very beginning but for some reason felt compelled to also record the skull-crushing numetal that was expected of artists making their type of music.  Mezmerize is System Of A Down without the uneven moments.  The four-years off have done them good: Co-writers Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian have managed to come up with an entire album of literally soaring melodies and harmonies with great hooks, yet still crush your skull with powerful riffs.  There are also some really great surprises on the album- \\"Radio/Video\\" (my personal favorite) hits you hard with the chorus and launches into ska for the verses.  It's insanely catchy- you can't not sing along with it.  My other favorite is \\"Old School Hollywood\\" which reminds me of (here's an obscure reference that NO ONE is sure to get) early (John Foxx era) Ultravox.  The only song that I'm not really crazy about is \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\", which just reminds me of all those other songs on previous SOAD albums that I wasn't really crazy about (and also features the line \\"gonorrhea gorgonzola\\".  Venereal cheese?  Thanks for that image.  I WAS eating...).  This is certainly the best SOAD album to date and makes waiting for \\"Hypnotise\\" all that much harder.
B00009W8N2|5.0|Between this album and Bergman's \\"The Seventh Seal\\" what makes the products of that northern land so bleak and so damn beautiful?  Sure, the song titles might bear a little good-natured mockery for Scandanavian Metal cliche (\\"The Twilight is My Robe\\"?  \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\"? \\"Under the Weeping Moon?\\"  With company like this on the track list, even \\"The Forest of October\\" doesn't stand out as particuarly sillily ...well...metal.  But then again even this is hardly as bad as an Immortal album as far as giggles are concerned.)  But every song on this album is absolutely gorgeous.  Most of them can still give me goosebumps.      One of the best features of this album is variety.  Though the songs all run over ten minutes (with the exception of two interludes) they never get dull thanks to constantly shifting melodies, copious clean interludes and some really ripping death metal growling/shredding all blended together into a nice broth of melodic death metal goodness.  In \\"The Twilight is My Robe\\" we hear four accoustic interludes, two with accompanying clean vocals, a great slap bass intro to a killer guitar riff, innumerable awesomely melodic guitar solos and great ripping death growls applenty.  Though the accoustic interludes are more or less ubiquitous, they're so well integrated with the harsher elements of the songs, often brilliantly blended together, actually, that they're an organic part of the music rather than some gimmick.  Though they're generally not included among 'post metal' bands like Isis, the effect is very similar, with the blend of speed and slowness, fury and softness and constantly evolving riffs essentially obliterating any sign of a conventional verse/chorus song structure.    \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\" is an awesome album opener, with a great opening guitar riff that introduces 14 minutes of relentless distorted guitars and death growls, with the standardly well-executed opeth clean/accoustic interlude present about ten minutes in.    \\"Under the Weeping Moon\\" is notable for its particuarly well executed interlude and the manner in which that breaks into some awesomely atmospheric guitar work around the six minute mark.    Even in an album this amazing, the standout tracks are the piano  solo \\"Silouette\\" and \\"The Forest of October,\\" the progressive death song it leads into.  I'd compare them to \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Children of the Grave\\" on Sabbath's MASTER OF REALITY, but while that combination was merely rocking/groovy this one is downright beautiful.  \\"Silouette\\" would stand on its own as a really great, atmospheric piece of piano composition but intertwined with the brutality of \\"The Forest of October\\" it's even better.    I've already mentioned mentioned \\"The Twilight Is My Robe\\" above.    \\"Requiem\\" is a nice accoustic segue into \\"The Apostle in triumph,\\" on this version of the CD, anyway, which also starts with some really nice classically flavored (?) accoustic guitar.    My Arms, Your Hearse admittedly has more emotive force and more direction and focus as an album, and Blackwater Park is more innovative and dissonant (plus it includes \\"Harvest,\\" which is an accomplishment, even for these guys), but \\"Orchid\\" displays great melodies and musicianship and awesome song structure.  I'd say it does so without being meandering, either, at least because it never fails to hold my insterst through all its twists and turns.    I'd recomend this album, and this band, to anyone that enjoys the  intros and interludes on Metallica's two Cliff Burton albums, particuarly the instrumentals, since Opeth's song structures seem to take that more intricate approach to heavy-metal songwriting its logical conclusion.  I'd also recomend it to anyone with a serious appreciation of melody and song structure that isn't -extremely- put off by metal standbyes like distorted guitars and death growls.  Hell, my folk-loving very unmetalhead ex girlfriend really loves this album just because it's so freakin' pretty.
B000000H6D|5.0|There are many bands in the \\"goth\\"genre that come and Go and not many of them can lay claim to being as original and Legendary as Type o.Sure you have NIN (SneezescenesterSneeze),you have the Cure,You have bauhaus but how many of these bands have Underground Cred and a cult following?(apart from christian Death)not many.So what is it about type O that makes them so special?.The fact that they have the wit,charm and musical Brilliance to accompany them on the way to the grave.This album sits alongside Disintergration as a classic and for good reason.Its full of sex,Black humour,sarcasm and Very dark music all that accompanied by Petes Ungodly deep voice.That and it has Black No.1 which is easily one of the best and most sarcastic looks at those suffering the \\"more goth than thou\\" syndrome.Not to mention Kill all the white people and we hate evryone which features Petes hilarious whoah whoah whoah whoah howling vocals.Definately not suited to the easily offended or those without a sense of humour.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe deserved every award received for this poignant and sensitive portrayal of John Nash.  In the span of decades we are taken from John's young manhood through old age and watch in wonder as he deals with his profession, his colleagues, his wonderful and loving wife and baby, and his imagined reality, all through the fog of mental illness.  We never once look down on his actions, although the scene with the baby in the bathtub is both horrifying and sobering, and we root for him to somehow pull the tattered fringes of his mind together and find peace within.<br /><br />Crowe's tortured performance along with a superb supporting cast, including Jennifer Connely as his supportive wife, will stay with you long after the last scenes.<br /><br />The score is moving and Ron Howard's direction reminds us why he is one of the best in the movie-making business.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Just goes to show that once you're famous, you can come up with pretentious drivel like this, and it'll still sell by the truckloads! Try their earlier stuff instead or prepare to be bored! Die hard Daft fans will force themselves to like it, but deep down inside you know it sucks! Any bedroom musician coulda made this. Ofcourse it wouldn't have been released because it woulda been trashed for the crap that it is!
B00008DDSC|5.0|The opening scene of \\"Secretary\\" drops the viewer into the middle of the narrative. In a shot that will be repeated 55 minutes later, Lee carries out a variety of office duties with poise and efficiency --despite the fact that she is wearing a bizarre and uncomfortable-looking restraint that holds her arms straight out at the shoulders. The first time around the scene seems odd, almost repugnant; Lee lopes with unnerving calm to (longtime David Lynch collaborator) Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score around a unsettlingly baroque office. Then, abruptly, a title card: \\"six months earlier\\". The narrative proper begins.     At first, it's unclear what this circuitous opening adds to the story, apart from an element of suspense that might not be if the events unfolded in strict chronological order: the opening scene presents a big \\"What?\\"; we wait anxiously to learn the \\"Why\\". What other purpose this scene might serve becomes clear with its reprise. By then a subtle understanding of its context is possible. The remarkable Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues Lee with such supple humanity that the viewer has become more than sympathetic, and understands how much this long-suffering, unassumingly brave woman is enjoying herself, arm-restraints and all. The scene is no longer unsettling, but celebratory. The scene hasn't changed. Maybe we have. Director Steven Shainberg, on the DVD commentary track, says he hopes that his film will do for S&M what \\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" did for homosexuality almost 20 years ago-- increase mainstream understanding. Perhaps it will.     On the same commentary track, the film's writer Erin Cressida Wilson says that the uncertain \\"Um.....\\" Lee utters after Edward has administered the first blow in the justly famous spanking scene is Wilson's \\"Favorite line\\". She then chuckles, and modestly refrains from explaining what she means. Why it's good: Although this pivotal scene is fraught with emotion, Lee's tentative \\"Um.....\\" is the only line of dialogue in it that acknowledges, even obliquely, what is taking place. Unlike the painfully verbose, excruciatingly clever screenwriters who currently plague independent film, Wilson realizes that what people say may be only tangentially related to what they mean, or are thinking, or what's happening, and that great feeling may lurk behind the most banal or fragmentary remark. \\"Secretary\\" is one of the strictest, fullest applications of this principle imaginable (Each page of the screenplay must contain one column each for speech and subtext). Never glib, never clever, just smart, \\"Secretary\\" is certainly a comedy of some sort, but it contains nothing that exactly qualifies as a joke. Its minimal dialogue leaves wide expanses in which the actors can and must communicate non-verbally. The leads are up to the task. Gyllenhaal (\\"JILL-in-hall\\") and the always watchable James Spader make adept use of the full actor's arsenal: facial expression, posture -watch Lee's gait change in the course of the film-, verbal pauses and inflection create a world of meaning beneath deceptively mundane, often monosyllabic, dialogue. Tune into these actors' peculiar wavelength and be spellbound.
B00005JKC3|2.0|This is NOT an action movie. I have never seen such a movie that was SUPPOSED to have special FX and action and had none. Well, other then Spider-man 2. This movie has about 10 minutes of action towards the end, but 95% of it is just talk, or some scietific blather that the normal-brained person can't understand. There is too much gooey sentementalism and dull childhood flashbacks that will bore you to death. If the entire movie had been like the one action sequence in the whole movie, this would be a 5-star movie. Avoid at all costs.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is an amazing album, from an amazing collection of musicians. It is short but is it ever great. Every track can be listened to easy without that urge to skip. After buying this album...i can't wait until this fall for the other cd. Anyone who gave this album a bad reveiw really needs to get their head examined or put that 50 cent album away for a while and listen to real music. Def. worth every cent.
B00005T30L|2.0|A film adaptation needn't be a carbon-copy of its source material, but it should capture its essence, or why bother? On this count, \\"Ghost World\\" is an almost complete failure. The scene that comes closest to evoking the Daniel Clowes universe   -- the Bollywood musical extravaganza that opens the film   -- is lifted wholesale from someone else's film. There's something very wrong with that.       The crucial difference between the comic and the movie is that while the comic is deliberately anti-dramatic, the film strains to generate drama and fails.   The film  jumps the shark mainly through  the enlargement of the role of Seymour, who exists in the original Ghost World as some anonymous loser the gals sharpen their claws on (they intercept a personals ad he's placed in which he's summarized his appearance as -- damn your gift for the pathetic detail, Clowes -- \\"bearded windbreaker\\"). Ordinarily, you can count on Steve Buscemi to make any film in which he appears better than it would have been otherwise.  Here, the attention he steals away from the girls' friendship cuts the heart out of the story, which rightly should be: Enid and Rebecca against the world, then, sadly, not even that.     Fatal Mistake Two:  Thora Birch could scarcely be less Enid-like. Her stabs at cool affectlessness are both overplayed and feeble, and Enid would never, ever guffaw at her own jokes. In the comic, Enid is a bundle of insecurities, but still has a convincing way with a put-down. Birch's version couldn't psych out a tub of coleslaw. Worse, this extremely uncharismatic actress has been endowed by the Lord Almighty, or a very ambitious plastic surgeon, with physical attributes that effortlessly upstage her in every shot in which they appear.    Scarlett Johansson does a much better job rendering  the  attitude of boredom and disdain that is the lynchpin of the girls' relationship.   Why couldn't they have dyed this great young actress' hair black and put Enid in capable hands?
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|It's been 4 years since Toxicity.  Can you believe it?  Since then, my musical interests have greatly changed.  Back then, I was a nu-metal fan and have long-since discarded these bands.  However, there are a few bands I always come back to when I'm in the mood.  After hearing their debut for the first time around a year ago, I've realized that this band is not actually nu-metal but progressive metal.  Perhaps Mesmerize IS nu-metal but their debut is definitely an oddball in TV music.   <br />    Mesmerize shows a more melodic side to the band in most of the songs.  The only song I find really powerful is Cigaro.  Yet, why do I give this album 5 stars?  Well, I really have to admit that the melodies produced by all these songs are truly mesmerizing.  Yes, I understand that the SYSTEM wasn't supposed to be a melodic band, but ultimately the only thing that makes them stand out in this album is the lyrics and the catchy choruses (with the exception of Cigaro). <br />   All in all, I enjoyed this album.  Everyone will love it, unless they're a critic.
B000002JKA|5.0|well,the album is reallyreally good,it was my first theather's one and i think i'll get others about DT soon!! <br />I beg your pardon to all of you guys for what I'm going to write but I'd like to say sth to mr. Mtv Rocks..actually I think that mtvsucks,(and so did kurt cobain, your idol didn't you know it?),how can you say that avril lavigne is one of the best guitarist?a guitarist????avril lavigne??ahahahhh!!!I can play her songs better than her,and my cousin that is 6 does it too!punk??do you know what punk is??oh no, no, you don't man,there's some kind of problem..why do you keep writing meaningless reviews about metal bands(I saw the ones about ozzy ,acdc, maiden..) if you aren't able to understand their music??korn and linking park is metal??eheheeh!!you suck man!!
6304779356|4.0|Pretty much everything's already been said about this movie; no need for me to supply a synopsis. Special effects are above-average, blah blah blah. <br /> <br />The one thing I do want to add, however: This movie has a most exquisite punchline, one that nearly made me roll on the floor laughing myself to death. The whole movie builds to this one incredible punchline, which alone compels me to give a three-star movie four stars. Great ending to a good movie.
B00005J9U1|4.0|Bob Marley and the Wailers are my favorite band, and I also like this CD, I just think it's missing some essential songs like \\"Concrete Jungle\\" and \\"Trenchtown Rock\\", other wise this is a good album featuring some of Bob's most classic reggae.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The brilliance of Green Day is always in the lyrics.  Sure, their latest works have included some radio friendly hits and ballads, but don't mistake Green for your run of the mill band. They are far from it.  They mesh feelings of angst, powerlessness, beaty, loneliness, political frustation, and love all in one classic album.  This is one that I'll be listening to 20 years from now.....AND SO WILL YOU!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Not what you'd expect form the LA alt-metal band, but none the less a great album. The Armenian political srongmen have produced a product like no other as is expected from Serj, Daron, Shavo and John. Once again, the band has experimmented with new sounds such as in BYOB,and Violent Pornograph. Serj and Daron have shown just how powerful thier vocals can be in tracks like Question and Lost in Hollywood(quite possibly my favorite track). Those looking for a more classic SOAD will be pleased with CIGARO and Revenga. All in all a good album, and a testement to SOAD's ability. Those new to SOAD, make sure you check out SOAD's debut album &quot;System of a Down&quot;.
B000008GAC|1.0|Just to clear up some confusion, the booklet is what is edited. The unedited version, has a cartoonish picture of a woman who has just been raped by some kind of robot monster thing. The music is not edited. Pointless idea really! Just thought this would help someone out there.....music gets 5 stars, whosever idea this was gets 0 stars.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|Forget all the history, the \\"beginning of a saga\\", etc... this movie doesn't need all this: it is just wonderful on its own merits. <br /> <br />The action starts from the very beginning, and it hardly ever stops.  The special effects are holding up pretty well (even the original ones), the script is tight and the dialogue witty, the acting generally OK (a few exceptions), the bad guys are just terrific, Harrison Ford is charming... what more do you need? <br /> <br />Visual literature it ain't, but who cares?  You'll have a great time.
B00006AW2P|3.0|The American debut of The Rolling Stones was part of the British Invasion, the wave of UK bands who hit the U.S. in the wake of the Beatles early-1964 breakthrough.  Only a handful of bands would mature and survive, and the best of them were The Rolling Stones.<br />Still, there was no guarantee from listening to this fine album that the Stones would be around.  Eric Burdon of the Animals was a better vocalist than Mick Jagger, the Yardbirds' Eric Clapton then later Jeff Beck and Jimmy Paige had the better guitar attack, and few British bands (beyond The Beatles) wrote their own songs.  That means the London blues bands largely recorded blues songs to fill their albums, and how long could they keep that up?<br />What the Stones did have were attitude.  Jagger's lewd, sneering vocals and Keith Richards' Chuck Berry-influenced guitar were the bedrock of this band from day one.  A third key ingredient was Brian Jones' slide guitar, perhaps the best slide playing east of the Mississippi Delta.<br />The album opens with a stunning remake of Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away.  The Bo Diddley beat makes this song move.  It is fantastic.  The remaining covers are performed fast and furious: Route 66, I Just Want To Make Love To You, Carol (great guitar), and the hilarious Walking The Dog.  The Stones' versions are light years from the earthy, dark originals by Muddy Waters et al, but have an energy that remains infectious 40 years on.  I'm A King Bee features the nastiest slide guitar from 1964.  <br />Of the originals, only Tell Me is worth mentioning.  This slow ballad echoes early-60s soul more than Chicago blues, and features some fine vocal work.  <br />The remaining songs, however, fail to measure up.  Can I Get A Witness is the poorest offering on this album, and left me scrambling for the far superior Marvin Gaye original.  Little By Little and You Can Make It If You Try are unconvincing British imitations of American vocals.<br />Overall, this is a solid set of black American blues &amp; soul performed by a white British band.  I would have awarded NEWEST four stars, but there are only 12 and no bonus tracks.  At least Apple/Parlophone issued the Beatles catalogue at their original 14 songs.  ABKCO - in all their wisdom and greed - have stuck us with these second-rate American incarnations at full price.  No wonder CD burning is rampant.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I first heard Sehnsucht's \\"Du Hast\\" Rammstein in a motel room on MTV.  Not that I like to admit that that was the first time I've ever heard of this band, but Rammstein became an addiction.  They're original, they push the envelope and leave you with a jaw-dropping feeling.  Sehnsucht was the first album I bought, following by Herzeleid, which was their best until Mutter was released.<br /><br />In this album they incorporate an orchestra, blend it magnificently with their trademark piano, unique guitar solos and amazing lyrics.  The only unfortunate part of this album is the release of Links 1 2 3 instead of Sonne.  Had the latter been released first, this album would have been more popular than Sehnsucht.<br /><br />In each song they incorporate an orchestra - sometimes on top of guitar riffs - with amazing lyrics (see Spieluhr, Zwitter, Rein Raus, Sonne, Mutter).  This is one of very few albums you will not get tired of listening to, because each time you listen to it you hear something else that you didn't notice the last time.<br /><br />This album showcases Rammsteins' absolute best yet.  Do not hesitate to add this to your collection.
B00006AW2O|2.0|As the Stones' second album, 12 x 5 is another collection of blues and soul covers with a few originals thrown in.  This time, however, the album was recorded at the famed Chess Studios in Chicago, shrine of the electric blues where Muddy Waters and countless of the Stones' heroes recorded their sides.  The sound is more polished with a heavier bottom end, which was what the Stones wanted.<br />The album kicks off with a strong cover of Chuck Berry's Around and Around then dovetails into the moody Confessin' The Blues, featuring some fine harp playing.  The album then dips into Empty Heart, a one-liner that goes nowhere, and follows with the inferior version of Time Is On My Side (the organ version, not the guitar).  Side one closes with their current single at the time, Good Times Bad Times &amp; It's All Over Now -- the album's highlight even if the latter is a Womack cover.<br />Side 2 is a patchy affair with If You Need Me being the only strong tune.  Susie Q is too short, too fast, while Under The Boardwalk must rank along with My Girl (Flowers album) as the worst cover by the Stones.<br />Again, ABKCO has issued the shorter US version of the longer UK album, yet is charging full price.  No bonus tracks.  While there are some fine moments on this album, it is a patchwork affair and suggests that the Stones were already running out of material for their albums and relying too heavily on borrowed tunes.
B0002XDODU|3.0|This record is a mix between Sehnsucht and Mutter.  They use the amazing instrumentals in Reise, Reise that made Mutter the masterpiece that it is, and similar lyrics and guitar riffs that they are famous for in Sehnsucht and some of Herzeleid.<br /><br />Like in every Rammstein album, every song has a plot.  They take it one step further, and add some harsher guitar riffs and a few flat tones - see Stein Um Stein, Moskau - but that's only my opinion.<br /><br />Reise, Reise is defenately an album to buy if you're used to Rammstein, but I wouldn't suggest it to be your first album.  They don't stand out as much musically as they do lyrically, but it's still an album worth the room in your collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I listened to Green Day for the first time while catching some of Woodstock II on MTV during the 90's.  I thought that they were...okay!  Not bad.  But I wanted to see what they would become...if anything.  Flash forward to May of 2005.  I now have an 11 year old daughter who is into music and likes Green Day.  She used some of her allowance money to buy this the other evening, and we both listened to it while I was taking her to school in the car this morning.  As a child of the 60's, and having seen and heard just about everybody and anybody over these so many years, I believe that I can be a good judge of music.  I can honestly tell anyone reading this review that the music on this CD...ROCKS!  This is some of the best rock n' roll that I've heard in a long time.  FANTASTIC!  In fact, I was so blown away by it that I'm going online and purchase some waaaayyyy overpriced tickets for the Green Day concert coming up in August at Merriweather Post in Maryland!  I'm impressed and I want to hear these guys \\"up close and personal\\"!
B0002OERI0|3.0|Back in the early 90's, these guys made a huge impact on the face of modern music.  They revolutionized \\"punk\\" and really were one of the main bands to make \\"punk\\" cool and mainstream.  I think they get lumped into the pop punk crowd unfairly.  They've always done their thing, and they sure know how to make money.  The thing about this album that disturbs me is the fact that they really do get political now and not only is that just trendy, but it's really in bad taste.  I have to say, based on that fact, these guys really did finally sell out.  Get some old school punk instead, like Black Flag.  Or some new stuff like Tiger Army or Rancid.  It seems more real to me.

Though the set offered here may have nicer sound and a cleaner picture, \\"not all that glitters is gold.\\"  Please don't support this attempt by George Lucas to rewrite history and destroy our true memories.
B0002Y4TM4|4.0|...I would hold out, save up, and buy the 2-disc edition directly from racket records at the band's website.  The campaign or other 2-disc version is more complete.  I've tried this mix, and it's fantastic, but the 2-disc will take you to an even more fantastic place!  It's a little more $, but it's well worth it. <br /> <br />This version is 4-stars,  <br />but 2-disc gets 5 stars!
B00004THAY|5.0|If you like the blues you need to own this album.  In my opinion it is a bit more Eric Clapton style than BB King but I find it smooth and I realy enjoy all the songs.  I find myself listening to it over and over and hearing new things in it.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|i also agree with some of the reviews- THIS SINGER NEEDS TO TAKE SOME SERIOUS LESSONS- SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOYING- I BOUGHT THIS CD- WHY!!!!! IM GONNA SELL IT BACK- OK MUSIC- BAD VOCALS, BAD, BAD VOCALS- THEIR 1ST IS THEIR BEST- THEY ARE PUKE NOW
B00003CXDV|5.0|I love science fiction movies.  But I would never go to a convention or buy a book how to speak klingon.  This movie does such a great job of spoofing Star Trek and many other shows I have enjoyed over the years in a way that just keeps you laughing.  What makes this movie even better is that while you laugh so much the first time, there are all sorts of deeper jokes you get on seeing the movie additional times.

6300271285|5.0|This 50's-style musical/comedy/satire is sure to put a smile on your face and have you rockin' to the tunes. Rick Moranis stars as Seymour, a clumsy, nerdy florist who secretly pines for his ditzy co-worker, Audrey. Seymour gets a mysterious plant that amazingly brings him fame and fortune, but it grows at an alarming rate, and it drinks... blood. What is Seymour to do?<br /><br />Rick Moranis gives his best performance to date as the quintessential loser who melts your heart. He has that puppy dog face and over-sized glasses, and a lot of talent. In the film's funniest scene, Steve Martin plays everybody's nightmare: a sadistic dentist (with Bill Murray as his too-willing patient). There are a lot of fun, bouncy songs, plenty of laughs, and some touching moments, too. Heartily recommended.<br /><br />Kona
0609610570|3.0|A lot of materials in this book can be found in my 1st year management course in University of Toronto textbook... This book doesn't have much to offer in my opinion; but it's a bit bias for me to critize this book hence my background.
0385512104|3.0|The upside down poodle on the cover was a clever touch, as some of the autistic children do see things upside down, but are not able to express it.  This book written by a Britisher, Mark Haddon, is so close to life it is unreal.  People who have not experienced contact with these exceptional people do have a distorted opinion.  To some, it's funny; to others, it's sad.  Such is life.  But to those who live daily with such a child see it as a burden, not an easy life, but the child is their flesh and blood and a valued individual.      The one thing a writer must do is to put himself in someone else's shoes.  Christopher, the \\"voice\\" of this novel has Asperger Syndrome, a behavior disorder similar to autism only milder.  He can't understand other people's opinions.  You can never get inside his head.  It's as if a wall is built up to insulate the tender feelings he might have.      Savant Syndrome is a rare condition in which these defective males verge on brilliance, math ability, or genius in the talent and music fields.  Chris (John Francis) Boone has a fantastic memory and math skills.  \\"I know all the countries of the world and their capital cities (I've heard that before) and every prime number up to 7,507.\\"  In the 8th grade, we had a mathematical genius in our small class and the male teacher tried each one of us at the blackboard to see if we could out do him -- none could.  We thought at the time that he was just strange, as math was all he could master.      Chris is a lot like the character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the 1988 movie, RAIN MAN.  Here in Knoxville, many such adults ride the buses and have menial jobs.  At one of the malls, I had a strange interaction with one of the children; waiting for a bus, I stood at the door (inside as it was cold out) and heard a mother castigating her young son, \\"Don't run in front of a car, do you hear me -- whatever you do, do not run in front of a car.\\"  He looked over at me; I winked at him and he winked back.  I waved to him, and he waved back.  As he started out the door, he said in a loud,clear voice \\"Good-bye.\\"  His mother grabbed him and yelled, \\"Did you say good-bye\\" two or three times.  He just looked at her perplexed.  I explained what I had done, and she said, \\"But he never talks.\\"  God works in mysterious ways, putting us in particular places for a reason.  You see, I had caught the wrong bus and was waiting for the right one.    At the Green Hills library in Nashville, last Spring, after the children's story hour, I sat on one side of Eric and his father (my son) was on the other reading a kids book to him -- one of his favorites.  I said, \\"Jeff, I am a non-entity to this child,\\" as he was totally unaware that his grandmother was there.  Sometimes, love hurts.    This book was released as a children's book and for adult readers at the same time, and has won many awards.  It is inspirational.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|The reason for my title is that the music is definately improving. Toxicity, considered their greatest album, and half of the songs I can't even remember because of the large amount of riffs in a song. It's like I could recall a riff but for the life of me couldn't tell you where it was from. A step back because Daron sings a lot more and he's not the most dynamic singer. And a jump to the side because the music is I hate to say it but more commercial than past efforts. <br /> <br />Intro/Soldierside: The middle eastern influence is definately on the song as Serj and Daron sing over a string arrangement and Daron's guitar. It's only a minute but it's kind of odd to open the record so calmly than have the next song. 7/10 <br /> <br />B.Y.O.B(Bring Your Own Bombs): The first single and repeated viewings hasn't been too kind but as a song it's good but that chorus has got to go. It's a good chorus but Daron's singing when they first start is good(he sounds downright womanly) then he just sounds awful later on. Has a good beat though. 8/10 <br /> <br />Revenga: Now we're getting into something good. The verses are great with Serj's rapid-fire delivery, chorus is nice in an almost pop-like quality and the solo fits perfectly. Should be a single honestly. 9/10 <br /> <br />Cigaro: The song's about corporations trying to outdo each other(like the game console wars with Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony) but only using a different way to tell it(men have it, women don't and some brag about its size). The \\"can't you see that I love my ****?\\" bridge is my favorite part. 8/10 <br /> <br />Radio/Video: To be honest, I rather hate this song. Also shows a pattern in future songs. Daron will either sing on his own or he's at the front or with Serj. Serj is rarely by himself. Serj does do a very high scream that's more annoying than anything. 6/10 <br /> <br />This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on This Song: Had to put whole title. Fairly short song but then again Steal this Album hadsome pretty brief songs. It's pretty much a Serj vocal workout(he even does this weird chipmunk-like voice) with some good guitar riffs. 8/10 <br /> <br />Violent Pornography: The tongue twister verses and a good pre-chorus but rather lackluster chorus. You probably want to sing along to the verse since it's just the words \\"everybody\\" sung fast with other words thrown in at the end. It's pretty good, nothing much to say of it. 8/10 <br /> <br />Question!: It's like Aerials and Toxicity had an illegitimate child and out came Question!. Very melodic verses before it's epic-sounding chorus then there's a big rock riff in the middle of it. Should be another single if I had my way. 9/10 <br /> <br />Sad Statue: That chorus honestly has got to go because it just ruins this thing. The main riff with the D chord and quick trills are just fun to play and the bridge which leads into the main riff is great, it's just that chorus. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood: Old school indeed. The synth guitar almost has a big 80's vibe to it. Nice syncopation(sorry, music talk) in the chorus between vocals and the guitars. Only thing that kind of ruins it is again Daron's singing. You don't need to sing on everything, buddy. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Lost in Hollywood: I hear this is the next single which I seriously hope not. This is a largely Daron sung ballad-esque song with Serj doing background vocals and the singing aspect is ok in the first section until the next part comes in. The \\"all you b****es put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care\\" line has to go. That line should be banned from music since everyone always does it. 8/10 for first verses, 7.5/10 for the \\"chorus\\" with the Santa Monica/b****es lyrics. <br /> <br />Now I'm not completely denouncing Daron here. He can add a good detail to a song when he sungs although some is out of place(like is smack my ***** in hollywood part in Prison Song) but easy on the singing next album ok?
B000002J2B|5.0|Up until this late 1976 release, Genesis displayed isolated snippets of climactic awe that defined their brilliance - yet their albums also contained equal amounts of uneventful, acoustic waste material. This Wind and Wuthering album, however, burst through the scene with a much higher ratio of excitement:dullness. W & W also boasts about the finest sound production on any progressive rock Lp, ever. The album jams (at many points) and yet displays a better, more mature progression of their trademark `storybook' sound. <br /> <br />The highlights of this album are more in the form of complete songs - not occasional moments. \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" is classic. The bold track opens the album and gives a 7-minute feel of hot, red-glowing ash being spread over the landscape. Phil's drumming and vocals are about as rocking as he's ever got. The other gem on this album continues to be favorite among progressive fans: \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\". This instrumental first kicks in as some sort of Jeff Beck-ish, jazz fusion workout, but the momentum quickly builds and pretty soon Phil's tom-toms sound like they are poking right through your speaker! THEN they suddenly shift tempo into a real Fire & Brimstone section, with Tony putting some really rough edges on his synthesizer. The only junk on this album is a short instrumental statement, \\"Wot Gorilla\\", but this little piece of filler material is very easy to just skip over. <br /> <br />Good power and stellar sound production. If you have to choose one Genesis CD out of the entire catalog, let it be this one. You may be surprised at how good it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002J09|5.0|Anyone who rates this CD below 5 stars is deaf or reatarded and has no business buying any CD's at all.  This is by far the CD ever made and Stairway to Heaven is simply the Number 1 Rock and Roll song of All Time!!!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux's 2nd solo CD is a delight!  I'd loved \\"Dreamland,\\" set it on the shelf for a few years, and had one of those deja vu experiences when one of my music buddies sent me a burned disc of his latest raves which included this wonderful new singer Madeleine Peyroux.  Back to the stacks & voila!  One professional reviewer cited this set produced by Larry Klein (known as the man who actually married Joni Mitchell) as being a more focused set; and stylistically, that may be correct.  The covers here are delightful.  My favorite track is \\"I'll Look Around\\" that has only been recorded a few times with versions by Billie Holiday & Nina Simone.  It's a lovely aching vocal rendition with Scott Amendola's brushes giving this a quintessential torch blues feel.  The Gene Austin \\"Lonesome Road\\" has been a bit more popular cover with big band versions by Tommy Dorsey & Benny Goodman and vocalists Louis Armstrong, Peggy Lee, & Frank Sinatra.  While I do have a couple of these in my collection, I hate to admit that I didn't remember them!  My first reaction was, \\"What a lovely new song!\\"  Peyroux's languid vocals grace the lovely lyric, \\"Look up, look up & greet your maker before Gabriel blows his horn.\\"  Peyroux also nails title track in an exquisite rendition.  When a classic like this has been covered by singers as diverse as Joan Baez, Ray Charles, Fats Domino, Lena Horne, Dinah Washington & Bessie Smith, with whom it is probably most closely identified (at least for me), it's hard to really put the stamp of individuality on it.  However, with Dean Parks' guitar & David Piltch's thumping bass, Madeleine glides through the melody, even giving out a little giggle at one point.  Born in Athens, Georgia, but raised in southern California, Brooklyn & Paris, Peyroux handles the French of \\"J'ai Deux Amours\\" (I Have 2 Loves) like a pro.  Her cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Blood On the Tracks\\" song \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" is excellent, spotlighting what an excellent composition it is.

B0000009SG|5.0|This album is ricockulously great. I don't understand why a couple of you said you don't like I'm The Slime because it has has an awesome melody, a cool groove and interesting guitar work. I don't get why that guy said that the live versions of these songs are better because I've always found them to be rushed and lose much of their original feel and lose pretty much all of their groove. George Duke plays some great solos, Jean-Luc Ponty is always a virtuoso violinist and Ruth and Ian underwood are both great as always. In my opinion this is easily one of FZ's greatest albums with many of his best tunes.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|In the extras short on the DVD Kerry Conran (?) talks about  the movie - he talks about references and inspirations, he talks about the look of the settings, the look of the machines, never once does he mention the plot. The question is, did he or anyone give much thought to the plot, other than as a  way to present the 'look' and the FX.   Now you are saying, \\"Ok, if you are so smart, how would you do it?\\" First I would have 'fleshed' out the robot girl, great potential for a evil villain left on the table. Second more Dex (Sp?)- the best acting in the movie and last more action.    Unfortunately this is a movie that gets more boring on second viewing, my recommendation is rent it, watch it once and send it back.
0767834739|3.0|With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil.  I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse.  With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film.  With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie.  With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|<br /> I have heard a lot of people bashing this movie because the main character is unrealistic, unlikable, and/or a dork.  Well guess what?  I went to school with someone who could have been Napoleon's and Kip's long, lost brother.  People are too used to seeing teen high school movies which obviously take place in parallel universes; where the \\"unpopular\\" kids are gorgeous and have a few \\"quirks\\" which somehow make them outsiders. <br /> <br /> NAPOLEON DYNAMITE IS KEEPING IT REAL!!! <br /> <br /> From the Happy Hands Club, down to the \\"Go Ask Alice\\" posters on the walls, and the principal whose more concerned about piatas representing real people getting beat up than the real people getting beat up, this is real high school life, not Hollywood fantasy world. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny because it's true.  It also hurts a bit how true it is.  You can't just sit and laugh through this movie.  You can laugh but you have to feel for Napoleon; sympathize with him, be proud when he succeeds.  This should happen naturally, and if it doesn't, you're probably just another Summer. <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, I love this movie, and it seems most people either hate this movie or absolutely love it.  You'll never be sure until you watch it for yourself.  So listen to your heart, take a chance.  Buy this DVD!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|He is one of the worst singers I have ever heard. He needs to stay off the mic and just keep playing the guitar. He ruins pretty much the whole cd.
B0006ZFQP8|4.0|Recorded in studio by the Staatskapelle, Dresden Orchestra, Carlos Kleiber, conducting, this 4-CD boxed set sounds great and the orchestra is full and with enough Wagnerian depth to satisfy the most critical musicologist. The cast of tenor Rene Kollo as Tristan, soprano Margaret Price as Isolde and contralto, Bridgitte Fassbaender are also solid enough that we withhold further comparisons to the earlier DG release featuring Deborah Voigt, other than to note a different release under the same label that sounded a little better overall. Having said that, the choice exists for those who might prefer Price to Voigt, which would probably be the only distinction. The digital quality of the disk is superb, although you might find the faint echoes, in parts, that are actually built into the opera (an offstage sailor) a little distracting, given that this is a studio recording. I faulted the other recording for the same error. We know the character is off stage, but the CD is an \\"audio\\" recording, and the echo is a distraction, not an asset. Still, its Tristan und Isolde and Wagner, performed by a strong cast and wonderful orchestra. How can you go wrong?

B0007Y08IS|1.0|I wanted to like this. I really did. I am a huge fan of South Park  and expected this to be at least as clever. Boy did it miss the mark. I didn't laugh once. The script was weak and the \\"parodies\\" were just silly and unimaginative. Nice try guys, but no cookie for you. This sucked in new and exciting ways.
B000001GQP|5.0|I first heard Carmina Burana in a college production back in Spring of 1965 (end of my freshman year).  Like virtually everybody who hears it for the first time, I was immediately taken with Orff's secular cantata and bought Jochum's FIRST recording on Decca LP (that was a mono recording from the early 1950's - this DG stereo account didn't come along until 1967).  When THIS recording came out, I bought the DG LP and discarded the Decca:  the sonics were MUCH better on the re-make, and the performance sounded more fully realized.    Since then, I have seen two other stagings of Carmina Burana and heard some of the other recordings (Muti, Ozawa, Previn, etc.), but my loyalties remain with this one.  Sure, the stereo sound is a little dated (a slight cut in treble smooths out the edgy highs - all in all, this CD is sonically a considerable improvement on the original LP).  The recording was supervised by Orff himself, Jochum's conducting is rhythmically vigorous and exhilarating, and the soloists all sound just great to me (not perfect, but great is good enough). I still think Janowitz does the \\"In trutina\\" more appealingly than anybody else I've heard.  The only other recording I have kept is the Stokowski (EMI), but that's mainly because of the coupling:  \\"A Pagan Poem\\" by Charles Loeffler, a beautiful work that deserves to be better known.  To my taste, the Jochum recording is preferable to Stokowski's Carmina Burana.    I don't think you can go wrong in buying this one.    Highly recommended.
0316172324|4.0|I liked the Tipping point and so picked this one up.  It is maybe not as break-through but it is still an interesting exercise and i recommend it.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|I watched about half of it and left the rest on for background noise. And noise it was! I loved the sets enough to rate this a star higher than I otherwise would. But the \\"music\\" was ghastly and the acting was way over the top. I read a review here that said that ALW stole large portions of the music from Puccini operas. I don't know about that but I swear to God about 40 minutes into it he does about 8 bars of what some of you may recall from the old DR Demento show as \\"Fishheads\\" by Barnes and Barnes. You can download the song here: [...] then listen to the film again. The laugh you get will be the best part of the movie.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|After the untimely retirement of Rage Against the Machine and the monster success of 2001's \\"Toxicity\\", System of a Down became the new standard-bearers of anti-establishment rock.  Their music is very unique, mixing hardcore metal and punk with classical and ethnic elements - you could easily find yourself furiously moshing one second and then doing the Fonz's Russian-kick dance (you know what I mean) the next.  Frontman SerjTankian brings a commanding charisma to the mic, but he also knows when not to take himself too seriously.  His two-part harmonies with guitarist Daron Malakian make beautiful moments, countered with rapid-fire rhyming and full-on screeching.  Lyrical content jumps back and forth between hard-edged socio-political commentary and Zappa-esque theatre of the absurd.  All told, the System modus operandi has set them apart from the sea of sameness flowing out of modern radio today.   <br /> <br />\\"Mezmerize\\" is the first of two System releases slated for this year (its counterpart \\"Hypnotize\\" drops in the Fall), a plan that may have failed this album a bit.  All of the trademark System sounds are here, but the songs themselves don't prop up the album start-to-finish.  You get the uneasy feeling that some of the stronger material from these sessions was held back for \\"Hypnotize\\", allowing lesser tracks make the cut on each.   <br /> <br />Other reviews have written about the more prominent role that Malakian's vocals take this time around and it's true - the trend is very real and apparent after only the first listen.  Even on the two-part harmonies, Malakian seems to be mixed louder than his counterpart.  Malakian is certainly the engine that powers the band by writing most of the material, producing, etc., but Tankian should always be its most prominent personality.  Otherwise, System begins to teeter on a more ordinary sound than they're capable of.   <br /> <br />Highlights include the first single, \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" (Bring Your Own Bombs), an anti-waranthem reminiscent of \\"Chop Suey\\", straightforward rock track \\"Revenga\\", and \\"Violent Pornography\\", a commentary on the state of entertainment, the media and \\"the kind of ---- you see on your TV\\".  The other pre-release track \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on this Song\\" provide worhty absuridst moments.   <br /> <br />It's unfair to hold up System's subsequent releases to \\"Toxicity\\", which was a masterpiece in the alt-metal genre.  However, the relative fall to \\"Mezmerize\\" is significant enough that it pales even compared to \\"Steal This Disc\\", the package of outtakes from those 2001 sessions.  Hopefully, the upcoming release of \\"Hypnotize\\" will flesh out the deserving tracks from this release into a single comprehensive album more worthy of following up \\"Toxicity\\".
B000099T2L|5.0|I went out and bought this album when it first came out, because i am a huge destiny's child fan, \\"Crazy In LOve\\" was so good I had to get it. Upon first listen on this CD I was a little disappointed because i expected all the songs to be like \\"Crazy in LOve\\" but they werent. I lost the CD while going to college in 2003, and  just recently bought it again earlier this year, This album sounded so different to me, rather than just listening to the 4 hits that were released(Crazy,Baby Boy, Me, Myself,And I, Naughty Girl)like i did when i first got it I listened to other tracks and i was astonished. <br /> <br />Crazy in Love- I still get goosebumps when listening to this song, it is a Classic. The horns and syncopated beats make it very very good, Classic. <br /> <br />Naughty Girl- This song is very funky and is an unusual pop song but it makes me want to hit the dance floor <br /> <br />Baby Boy- This song is So good, its addictive and very entrancing.  <br /> <br />Hip Hop Star- Beyonce sounds very different on this song, but it is still a good sound for her. <br /> <br />Be With You- I really didnt like this song, I dont know why but it didnt realy appeal to me <br /> <br />Me, Myself and I-This song is by far the 2nd best on this album. everytime i listen to it i feel empowered by the lyrics and anytime im down it inspires me. <br /> <br />Yes- This song is a very good R&B song and i really love it, i think alot of ppl can relate to being in this situation. <br /> <br />Signs- This song is also one of the best, could have been a single, it is mellow and groovy and missy doesnt over do it here like usual <br /> <br />Speechless- This is also a classic song, Old school R&B at its best, and showcases Beyonce's vocal ability very well <br /> <br />That's How You Like It-I didnt like this song at first, but after listening to it, it's a very good pop song.  <br /> <br />The Closer I Get to You- I hated this cover when first listening, but now i have it on repeat over and over again, It shows once again Beyonce is not afraid the step outside the box and duet with Luther Vandross, showing her versatility <br /> <br />Dangerously in Love, Pt. 2 -This is a song that made me cry on the Survivor album and yet does the same on DIL, a acoustic guitar was added to DIL pt. 2 and it is very good <br /> <br />Gift from Virgo- didnt like this song in 2003 or 2005 <br /> <br />Daddy- MOst underated song. This is the 3rd best song on the album, I loved this song so much, I cry every time I hear it or sing it, It shows that Beyonce is very humble and thankful for all the things her dad has done for her, and made me realize what my parents have done for me and how i need to appreciate them. This song is superb. <br /> <br />This album could be re-released without the songs that made it sell over 9 million copies worldwide and still do incredibly well by releasing Signs,Yes, Speechless, and Daddy. By far the best album of 2003 and maybe the best of this decade. <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is an OUTSTANDING CD!  I first heard of Michael on the View where he sang a live performance of \\"Home\\", it was beautiful.  I just purchsed this CD yesterday and I have fallen in love with it.  I'm a Dean and Frank fan myself and Michael is sucha wonderful combo, I've heard that they compare him to Frank's voice and Dean's looks!  When I heard \\"I've got you under my skin\\" it was unkanny on how much he sounded like Frank but had a style of his own.  His voice just melts right threw, sultry and bold and seasoned.  There isn't one bad track on this CD.  I have to say that one of my favorites is Track #8 I could have it on repeat for hours, but since I have bought the CD it is all I have listened too.  Do your self a favor and purchase this it is a master peice!
1594200106|4.0|Even though reviews on the outside cover of books and in newspapers and magazines often entice me to purchase a book, I often find that they are flawed in my eyes in some way once I have read the work.  Nonetheless, I think it is only proper to review a book on its merits as seen by the individual reading it without formulated expectations derived from the outside cover.<br /><br />With that being said, I truly enjoyed The Shadow of the Wind and had difficulty putting it down.  It made me look forward to my quiet time with the book.  I found it easy to get into the characters and the mystery behind them all.<br /><br />It seemed to be more of a thriller/adventure than a great literary work, although I can say that I thought it was well written.  It also seemed less lofty than many reviewers expressed - but the author had a knack at developing a scene with very little setup.  I often found myself absorbed picturing the scenes and actually feeling as if I was walking alongside Daniel in Barcelona.  It somewhat reminded me of Atonement by Ian McEwan although it did not delve into the thoughts and motivations of the characters as much.<br /><br />Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read.
B000683VI4|4.0|I have never seen a girl cry more than I did watching this movie!! She cried seemingly through the entire thing.... It was a great love story, tragic and happy all wrapped into one.<br /><br />Drop the macho trip, enjoy the movie... your lady friend will appreciate the sentiment.
B00079FUI6|5.0|From the moment it first aired, DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES proved to be a ratings phenomenon for its network, ABC. Its pilot was the highest-rated show of that week, and the audience kept growing throughout its first season. The reason for its immediate appeal and success, moreso than anything, was that the show was wickedly twisted, often unpredictable and funny. Though creator Marc Cherry refers to it as a satire of upper-middle-class suburban life, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" functions as a mix of great comedy and pure soap opera. It has mystery and romance, twists and cliffhangers. And it's often very funny.<br /><br />The writing is generally excellent. You can guarantee at least one moment per episode where you'll laugh out loud, while the \\"Mary Alice Young\\" mystery that kicks off the first episode remains compelling throughout the season.<br /><br />To sell it all, the cast of experienced actors is absolutely superb. Teri Hatcher - as the bumbling Susan Mayer - and Marcia Cross - as prim Bree Van De Kamp - give career-best performances. Cross is my personal favorite because she can shift tones from wrenching drama to mocking comedy in one scene, and her plotline thus far is the one with the most meat.<br /><br />Felicity Huffman, who was wonderful in SPORTS NIGHT, plays harried Lynette Scavo with a tremendous amount of intelligence. Eva Longoria is fabulously silly as Gabrielle Solis, a self-involved former model who amuses herself by committing adultery with her teenage gardener.<br /><br />The men in the show are great, as well, particularly Steven Culp as Bree's exasperated husband.<br /><br />The plot keeps you guessing. You'll get sucked into the show almost immediately, and \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has kept up the momentum. It's fantastic.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I am excited today, and I had to share.  I am listening (over and over again) to what I believe will remain the best album of 2004.  I love this record (yes, record).  Remember when an album was about 10 songs and 45 minutes, so it could fit on one side of a cassette and you could listen to it in your car on a Friday night?  Well, this has 10 songs and clocks in at just under 48 minutes.  It reminds me of life: wild and gentle; passionate and longing; fun and pretty; sorrowful and hopeful.  It truly has it all.  The Arcade Fire is a husband and wife team (plus lots more people) from Montreal with punch and rhythmic power and the ever-undervalued knack for true melody.  There's a definite 80's feel, some Talking Heads, some New Order, but all with modern orchestrated beauty and drama.  It's really quite ultra-emotional, without being pretentious, overwrought or dull.  It's pop rock music, oh yeah.  It moves man; and the lyrics are moving too.  So good, you can't pick a best song.  If you don't have it yet, get it...suck it up.  Chills.  Trust me on this one.  It's already a classic to me.  I'd campaign for this record.  Music is wonderful yet again.  The Chancellor.
B0000DBJDM|3.0|Review number 238. 'Live In Pompeii' was filmed in October, 1971 during a band's gig with no audience. Running time is 91 minutes. Remember seeing this awhile back when album rock FM radio stations would often have Midnight Movie showings of - maybe two films as such on the weekends. Plenty of extra features on this DVD - in which I believe that I might like a bit more so that I did the actual performance. Sound quality on this concert DVD could be better + there are too may extreme close-up - I thought. Tunes that I dug the absolute most were the strangely-played &#34;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&#34;, &#34;A Saucerful Of Secrets&#34; and the always-great-to hear &#34;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&#34; (one of Roger Waters true masterpieces).

B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon is widely considered as one of Vincente Minnelli's lesser achievements. The critics were somewhat disenchanted that Brigadoon was filmed on a sound stage in Culver City rather than &quot;on location&quot; in Scotland. MGM had not helped matters by actually dispatching Minnelli and Producer Arthur Freed to Scotland to scout for suitable filming locations. MGM, like the other major studios, were finding themselves in somewhat dire financial straits due to competition from television and certain pieces of anti-trust legislation that loosened their monopolistic grip over the entertainment industry. When MGM pulled the plug on the concept of an &quot;on location&quot; shoot (they were well aware of Minnelli's obsession with perfection and expected that he would go well over budget if given a free rein), the entire project became saddled with an image problem. By 1954, movie audiences expected something more than fixed indoor sets and painted scenery, especially from a work so site specific as Brigadoon.<BR>    Minnelli faced other obstacles. Ansco was a cheaper and somewhat inferior colour processing system than Technicolor, which no doubt irritated his refined sensibilities. He also had to come to terms with the new demands of Cinemascope and full stereophonic sound, with somewhat mixed results.<BR>    Even more troubling is that the choreography was in the hands of Gene Kelly, who seemed determined to emphasize the dancing rather than musical  element at the heart of Brigadoon. The two had worked wonderfully together on &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, but on the set of Brigadoon their artistic visions clashed. It is telling that Brigadoon was their last collaboration.<BR>     Critics in the 1950's were also a better informed breed than they were 20 years earlier and they were quick to pounce on certain &quot;inaccuracies&quot;, such as the outrageous blends of tartans, which cerainly would have made any Laird wince, and the suitability of much of Mr. Kelly's choreography; hardly Scottish by a long stretch.<BR>     Yet in spite of these encumberances, I love this film. The painted diaramas are in keeping with the preposterous nature of the storyline, and what beautiful sets they are! Minnelli's artistic flourishes are evident eveywhere, such as the ample plantings of heather which must have caused a state of full employment for local florists. Minnelli&quot;s outstanding contribution to American Film was his refined palette of colour schemes, and in Brigadoon his genius achieves its climax. Make no mistake, Brigadoon is a feast for the eyes.<BR>     The music by Lerner and Loewe is superb, with haunting melodies and stirring choruses. Cyd Charisse, always more celebrated for her dancing than her thespian skills, in Brigadoon achieves her finest hour, even though her singing voice is dubbed. Gene Kelly's type of acting is perhaps an acquired taste, but there is no denying his cat like grace and radiant boyish good looks.<BR>   On the whole, the imperfections of Brigadoon only make it more endearing. It is the one musical I never tire of seeing over and over again.
044022165X|4.0|Rudy Baylor is a young lawyer just starting out in Memphis. He's barely making ends meet and has to exchange mowing lawns for his rent. His first case falls into his lap and it's a chance of a lifetime - an insurance company refuses to pay the medical treatments for a man dying of leukemia. Several problems face Rudy with this case, a few minor things like first passing the bar exam, getting together enough money to even try this case since he's flat broke, and getting the courage to go up against a huge corporation who just happens to have hired the best defense attorney around.<br /><br />John Grisham endures his characters to the reader and makes everyone think Insurance Companies are corrupt and only after profits.  THE RAINMAKER is one of those books that will have the reader cheering against Corporate America and wondering just how many times this type of atrocity has actually happened. Many of Grisham's books make you think about things in real life and wonder just how much is being covered up by big money corporations. This is definitely one of those adventures!<br /><br />THE RAINMAKER is another great book by this writer. Not as good as some of his earlier works, e.g. The Firm, The Pelican Brief, or A Time To Kill, but still a decent read and definitely worth the time spent. This is not one to keep you awake at night to finish, but it will keep you occupied, entertained, and wondering.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Definetly not the best SOAD release, but it has some tracks on here that I really enjoy listening to. (Violent Pornograpy, Old School Holywood, B>Y>O>B, Question!) Like some have said, if you dont own any SOAD CD's yet, get Toxicity before this. Overall 3.9/5.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I happened to come across Michael Buble on the radio with the first track on this album, \\"Feeling Good\\" and I had to buy this CD.  From beginning to end, this is an excellent CD.  It has both love songs and swing style tracks.  I highly recommend buying this CD to any music listener.  There's something for everyone on this CD.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I can't believe some of these songs are songs that SOAD decided not to use before this. This disc has so much variety on it, and there is not one bad track in my opinion. I definetly reccomend the purchase of this CD. Overall 4.8/5
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down's debut is by far their best album. While many say Toxicity is better, that album really is pretty boring. There's something new and original on every song here. <br />I'd have to say my favorites are \\"Sugar\\" \\"War\\" and \\"CUBErt\\" and there's only one song I skip every time on here, \\"suggestions\\" and it's pretty good for a cd to keep my attention that well. <br />Although it is their best, I don't think you should get this as your first SOAD cd because you won't fully appreciate their other albums if you do. Get Mezmerize or Toxicity first then this <br />Oh and to the a**hole below me, you gotta stop going around to good bands and saying they suck and that Korn and Slipknot are better. I love KoRn but SOAD is better, musically and lyrically, and Slipknot sucks compared to these guys, I'm sorry. <br />Perhaps if you actually listened to System of a Down your opinion would be different.
B00005JNEI|2.0|This film has some elements of truth in it. It also has many skewed and inaccurate and deliberately manipulative scenes. The best review was by a liberal published in Slate magazine [...] The film Michael Moore should have made is \\"911 in Plane Site.\\" Review this film [...] and related topics at [...] as well as [...] and related sites to get a glimpse of the truth. This film is mostly fluff and fairytale and misleading.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down is one of my favorite bands (by far my favorite metal band) but this album has let me down. First of all, even though it's been said a million times before Daron needs to stop taking lead vocals. Serj has a great voice and he's really fun to listen to, he makes the band who they are, and not just another band out there. <br />Onto the cd... B.Y.O.B., Cigaro, Radio/Video, Question! among others are great songs but there's letdowns on here too, like Old School Hollywood. not that bad of a song but nothing like the better songs. But nothing on here really matches up to \\"Soil\\" \\"Peephole\\" or \\"P.L.U.C.K.\\" off the band's debut cd, which is by far the best release by these guys. <br /> <br />I'll suggest you buy SOAD's cds in this order <br />\\"Mezmerize\\" (this one, duh) because it's mediocre for the band but good compared to other bands, and it'll let you know what these guys can do <br />\\"System of a Down\\" Best cd EVER. YOu might think mezmerize is good till you hear this but this really is amazing <br />\\"Toxicity\\" mediocre (with the exception of Prison Song and Shimmy) but you need it if you're a fan <br /> <br />

0385512058|5.0|I've read quite a few business books over the last year, and this one stands out for me.  It's presented me with a radically different worldview. <br /> <br />Where I would approach a task with the question \\"How do I get this done?\\", Keith approaches it with \\"Who are the people that can help me get this task done?\\"  This is a stunning shift in one's point of reference.  I wish I'd read this book 20 yrs ago. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Oh man, am I happy with this album.  After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't expecting ANYTHING from this cd.  The majority of reviews I read on this website aren't reliable to begin with, so my only recommendation is to go listen to the album yourself.    SOAD's self titled debut is still the best system album, with its raw intensity, unpredictable compositions that never seizes to swing and sway you, Serj's incredible vocals that can't be found in any other album (which I miss more than anything), and.... well, the band just seems to go all out in their self titled debut.    Then came Toxicity.... I loved 'Chop Suey', and that's probably the song that blew this band up more than anything.  Their 2nd effort seemed to have a few more radio friendly songs, but the overall feel of the album was lacking.  I found myself often skipping songs, which was never an issue with the 1st album.  A lot of the energy previously seen from SOAD were gone, and the majority of the songs seemed more like B-sides compared to the incredible self-titled album. Steal this album could've switched a few songs with Toxicity to make their 2nd effort more credible.    Then comes Mezmerize... I understand many of the negative reviews might be derived from the fact that this album is well... different from their previous efforts.    Most notable will be Daron's increased role in singing.  He sounds good harmonizing with Serj, but that's only because he has Serj's strong vocals to cover up for his weaknesses.  When Daron sings by himself, it's a different beast... s***, he sounds like me when I'm singing in the shower.  There's a reason why I'm not on American Idol, but atleast my voice doesn't squeal as much when I sing as Daron's often does.  This is my biggest gripe about this album, and Serj's raw talent and personality is nowhere to be found in Mezmerize that it's a shame.    Other than Daron's few weak vocal points, the rest of the album is simply amazing in showcasing SOAD's growth potential.  More emphasis on melodies and harmonizing are stressed in this album, and as an album as a whole, it has a much more consistent feel than Toxicity.  I can leave it on and not worry about reaching over to skip a song, and each song is done so much better than most of Toxicity.  The unpredictable feel of their debut album is somewhat back, but at the same time, SOAD sounds so different that it completely grants them a NEW album, and a NEW feel that I expect from every successing effort from a band.    Fans are always going to have their favorite album they compare every other albums to.  I can't be surprised they're dissapointed when they find that a new cd doesn't sound like the ones they grew up to love.  But I find it boring if all of the albums for a band sounds the same; great bands usually change up their styles a number of times in the span of their career.  I like this new album because it's different, but at the same time it's CLASSIC System of a Down.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I watched this movie with really no expectations, but I did laugh a lot. Will Ferrell is super funny as Ron Burgandy, a hip, kinda (sexist) clueless, immature local newsguy, and Christina Applegate really brings Veronica Corningstone to life, she knows what she wants and is tired of being belittled and given fluff assignments in the age of women's lib. Trouble is, she falls in love with Ron and their rivalry on-air ends up costing him his job. There are lots of funny moments, a lot at the expense of dimwitted weather guy Brick (Steve Carell from the Daily Show) and the big street throwdown with the different newcasters from the area (including Vince Vaughn as Ron Burgandy's rival, Ben Stiller as the Latin newsguy and Tim Robbins representin' PBS).

Oh, and yeah, I've done a bit of \\"rock and roll journalism\\" myself, so, you know, \\"been there-done that-bought the T shirt-moved on.\\"

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down have been impressing people for almost a decade now, but I don't think that anyone could have predicted that they would hit the peaks that they have reached with the latest offering, \\"Mezmerize\\".  <br />     It is a beautiful, educational trip through the best that music has to offer. The entire album is a trip and has no weak moments. The occasional SOAD listener will know what they are getting themselves into, the only difference stylistically, is the growing presence of guitarist/co-songwriter Daron Malakian. His quirky guitar riffs along with even quirkier vocal expressions is a perfect comliment to the ever-present voice of primary frontman Serj Tankian. <br />     The album begins with a short melodic introduction called Soldier Side, which really gets you in tune with the bands political awareness. Then they get right to the first single, B.Y.O.B. This is a great sample of everything that the band does right, melodic and beautiful at times, screaming, loud and erratic at others. The song continues the political sattire with the anti-war sentiments that include, \\"Why do they always send the poor\\" They move further into the album with great purpose and leave no stone uncovered. The standout tracks have to be \\"Radio/Video\\", \\"Sad Statue\\", and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\". <br />     This album is filled with songs that we will remember for years. This album is a true classic and is by far the album of 2005, so far. It has been a pretty dissapointing year, so this came at a perfect time. <br />      <br />     BOTTOM LINE: 9.5 out of 10 <br />     Masterpiece from beginning to end, the only \\"problem\\" might be the short length of about 38 minutes, but the reason for that might be the best news the music world has ever heard, \\"Mezmerize\\" is the first half of a double album release. We will be able to look forward to the incoming, \\"Hypnotize\\", due out in the Fall this year, to save us yet again. System of a Down, we bow down to you for finally taking over where Rage Against the Machine left us.
B000002H97|4.0|Hey I have not gotten this album yet and I want to check it out!<BR>I ordered it from Walmart and I really wanna hear Enter Sandman.<BR>I have heard that song on the radio and it is one great song.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Well I have to say that this cd sucks. This band has gone downhill since their first cd. The lyrics are pretty stupid and the extra singing by the guitar player is horrible. I sold the cd 2 days after I bought it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Who would have thought that a movie would be able to create sets and costumes as equally beautiful as the ones in Moulin Rouge? I had my doubts before seeing this movie. I had never seen the play and the music hadn't appealed to me very much. After watching it, though, I was so awestruck by its design that the songs didn't sound so bad after all. Of course, Joel Schumacher having once been a costume designer and art director, knew what  he was doing. Sure, there may have been criticism that the Phantom wasn't portrayed correctly, but hey, there's nothing wrong with updating a classic. I got the special edition thinking I would learn more about the process of the film, but it was mostly interviews with people not even in the movie.<br /><br />  Revered critics Ebert and Roeper both gave \\"The Phantom\\" thumbs down because they claimed that the Phantom looked more like a GQ model with the mask as his fashion accessory. Also, that the actor who played the Phantom did not sing well. They also may have a biased view because they said they didn't like the play to begin with. Still, they did mention that the sets were among the best they had ever seen in a movie, which was good.<br /><br />  Anyways, it doesn't really matter what critics thought of it. The movie was great, and is now sided with my other favorite, Moulin Rouge.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I had been waiting for about four months since first I heard that SOAD was releasing a new album.  Two days ago it finally arrived and has been playing nonstop since.  All of the songs on this album are energetic, frantic yet beautiful all at the same time.  My only gripe is that this album is very short, even moreso due to the fact that one of the tracks is an intro peice, giving them ten songs, and since two of their songs have been on their website for a while (B.Y.O.B. and Cigaro) that leaves anyone who really likes this band and visits their site occasionally, only 8 new songs to listen to.  I have read some of the other reviews and yes, this album is a little overpowered by damon malakian doing the majority of the vocals, but I will say that I enjoy listening to him and Serj singing together.  Bottom line...Any system song could sell on I tunes for $5 a song and be worth it.  Buy this cd
B00009L1TA|5.0|Basic is a very suspenseful film full of unforeseeable plot-twists. But not the badly crafted type, these twists and turns are edible and well woven into the story.  <br /> There is no point giving a synopsis because the story 'isnt wuite what it seems\\" from the beginning.  <br /> Deriously, though, you should get this, sit in the dark and watch it. you will not take your eyes of eh screen for a minute <br />...
B00005JNVS|5.0|This movie was a combination of The Matrix, Enter the Dragon, and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka.  Anyone down in the dumps needs to see this movie.  I couldn't stop laughing.  This movie is like no other karate movie you've ever seen.  The makers of this movie are brilliant.  It's unpredictable.  It had a funny plot.  I loved seeing the kung fu fights using modern technology.  What more can I say?  This movie needs to be used in group therapy sessions! <br /> <br />Wanda in Chi-Town
0684874350|5.0|<br /> Do you like to read autobiography?  Then, Angela's Ashes was written for you.  The book is a non-fiction work.  In 1938, Frank McCourt and his family lived in America.  Later that year, his sister was born and died one night when she was an infant.  His alcoholic father and his pious defeated mother and Frank and his brother's moved back to Limerick, Ireland. <br /> This book is a classic, of what an Irish childhood was like living in poverty.  Frank McCourt made it clear from his book that Irish Catholic childhood his miserable.   <br /> Frank was a poor boy who lived in America after the death of his sister Margaret.  His mom couldn't stay in the house.  She would often hear Margaret and smell her and see her even though...They move back to Ireland.  Were it's worse then America.  When they got to Limerick the Irish people lived in poor houses they were starving.  Frank's father who has a problem with drinking.  Who can't hold a job, when he gets a job he gets paid, spends it on beer.  Angela Frank's mom is sad, loves her family, but hates her husband for drinking.  Angela's mother doesn't like Malachy, which is Frank's dads' name.  They don't like him because his from the north.  So one-day Frank's dad left and never came back.  It was hard on his mother, frank got a job.  They had to move out of their house they lived with some guy.  Who control his mother.... <br /> I've reviewed this this autobiography and I loved it.  The way his family believed in the Catholic Church how much love and strength they had for one another.  The survival of Frank and his brother's is what the book is mainly about.  They were poor and hungry.  This book inspired me and made me feel good about myself that I come from a culture that takes care of me.  If you read this book I hope you have a new perspective on you life. <br /> <br />
B00080Z53O|4.0|Your personal position on euthanasia will probably determine whether or not you consider the life of Ram&oacute;n Sampedro to be inspirational.  But his story as told in &quot;Mar adentro&quot; (&quot;The Sea Inside&quot;) certainly provides food for thought.  Ram&oacute;n became a quadriplegic at the age of 26 and when this 2004 film begins he has spent even more years confined to a bed.  He could be in a wheelchair, but Ram&oacute;n refuses.  What he wants is for the Spanish courts to grant him the right to die.  His reason is that he does not find the life he is living to be one of dignity.  Ram&oacute;n does not judge those who are in a situation similar to his own who want to go on living, but for him life has become unbearable and he wants to have the dignity that he is denied in life by dying.<br />The great irony is that for the most part you would not know this his life was so unbearable to look at Ram&oacute;n (Javier Bardem, in a wonderfully understated and captivating performance).  He is articulate and smiles often, showing both wit and humor in his conversations with others.  Ram&oacute;n can still write, using a pen that he holds in his mouth.  Far from being neglected, his sister-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), has been taking good care of him, aided by her son, Javi (Tamar Novas).  But his brother, Jos&eacute; (Celso Bugallo), wants Ram&oacute;n to stop talking about wanting to die and their father wonders how a son of his could want to give up on life.  Still, Ram&oacute;n thinks mainly of the empty part of the glass of life and is pushing  his case in court against a legal system that apparently wants nothing to do with him or his thorny issue.<br />What is different at this point in his quest are two women who become involved in Ram&oacute;n's life.  Julia (Belen Rueda), is a lawyer who is suffering from a degenerative disease and he has picked her because he thinks she will be more sympathetic to his cause.  What he does not anticipate is that they would fall in love with each other.  Then there is Rosa (Lola Duenas), a local woman who decides she has to visit him and becomes part of his support group as well, even if articulating her motives is beyond her capability.  The addition of this two women changes things for Ram&oacute;n who insists that the greatest show of love his family and friends can have for him is to allow him to die.  Trapped by the refusal of any one friend to do all that he needs, Ram&oacute;n finds a way to make their piecemeal support enough.<br />&quot;Mar adentro&quot; does a good job of presenting both sides of the issue.  The only party to the dispute that comes out looking bad are the courts, that seem to prefer sidestepping the issue by ruling on technicalities rather than making a direct ruling.  Ultimately, what Ram&oacute;n has going for him is that he is so reasonable.  His anger is usually reserved for Javi on such mundane points of life as the placement of a comma in a sentence, and there is only one night where Ram&oacute;n sinks into the depths of despair and cries out in the night, asking why it is that he wants to die.  But there are other sequences in the film that answer that question, showing through the literal flights of Ram&oacute;n's imagination the maddening limitations of his daily routine.  In the end, Alejandro Amenabar's film does not ask you to either endorse or accept Ram&oacute;n's decision, but simply to understand its rationality.a (Lola Duenas), a local woman who decides she has to visit him and becomes part of his support group as well, even if articulating her motives is beyond her capability.

0743454537|2.0|When I first started reading My Sister's Keeper, I was intrigued. I enjoyed the use of multiple voices. I thought Anna was sweet and Campbell the attorney was a cool guy. The family dynamics seemed realistic even. It was somewhere around page 150 that I started cringing and the bad metaphors. Around page 250 I was wondering what Campbell's romantic relationship possibly had to do with the story. At the 350 page mark I was reading because my book group wanted me to (luckily, it is an easy read, probably about 10th grade reading level). At the conclusion of 450 pages I hurled the book into the trash bin.  The ending will appall you. The book is not well written, but worse it is inaccurate and irresponsible, especially the authors treatment of people with epilepsy.
0156027321|4.0|In time I shall read The Life of Pi again. I will do so because I am certain there was much I missed along the way.  What might have been missed was no fault of the storyteller, but more the detail and depth in which I as the reader became engaged.  Yann Martel tells a story well, and I was captivated from the beginning of this one. I was captivated throughout, but not always comfortable.  <br /> <br />Initially Martel writes of Pi's relationship with the animal residents of his father's zoo and Martel educates and delights in doing so.  Pi's exploration of faith and his friendships with those who view faith through different eyes were engaging.  I liked the residents of Pondicherry and would have liked to remain there longer. <br /> <br />It was Pi's adventure on the Indian Ocean that brought about my own discomfort.  If you have ever sailed in a relatively small boat on the open sea then you know the tightening of the gut and wild maneuvers that can occur in high seas, punctuated by the mix of fear and boredom that the doldrums bring. Having a Bengal tiger along remains more than I can imagine.  But Martel weaves a story I simply wanted to believe.  In the end, I didn't know what to believe.  The story shifts.   The very fact that there was an issue of believing such a high adventure, fictional tale points to the very skill of Martel's storytelling.  I want to read those wonderful words again.   <br />

B00005M91K|5.0|This film was truly moving and had all the things that are signifigant (and needed)for all life. This film showed nature, religion, and civilization-the basis of which our whole world was formed. This was a truly moving film and I reccommend that everyone who can see it go see it. Keep some tissues handy, too!
0440234743|4.0|Although the book tends to drag in spots, the over all plot is outstanding.  It combines hero daydreaming with reality.  As a 31 year police veteran, I am somewhat familiar with the legal system and Mr. Grisham is obviosly well grounded in it.  The Testament really shook me as I, too, am struggling with some of the same religious questions.  The author puts the problem into perspective and then proceeds to explain it without becoming maudlin.  I liked the book a lot.  Thank you Mr. Grisham.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Oh man..... Before this album System was one of my favorite bands... This new album angers me... first of all Daron sings WAY too much. His voice sounds like a drowning weasel when compared to Serj. Although his voice is a good addition in some songs, when he sings in every song... its taxing... The guitars, while okay dominate every song... the drums and bass are flat. And short.... 11 songs... 38 min.... why do you need 2 CD's for that many songs? why not put them on one CD? if they have more on the second song... why not release them at once as a dual CD album?  <br />CAUSE THEY SOLD OUT.... DARON DRIVES A DAMN HUMMER <br />They really have destroyed my respect for them... which was great at one point... even their anti-bush anti-corp is getting overdone....  <br />I swear if the new tool or pearl jam albums suck.... i'm commiting suicide
B00005JL96|5.0|I'm a little behind the 8-ball here, only recently saw this movie. Loved the music, have played the opening Hawaiian dance scene over and over. The premise is hilarious and poignant, a lonely little girl who thinks the alien renegade is a puppy. Meanwhile, Stitch's great scene, sitting in the woods with a copy of \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" clutched to his chest, waiting for his family to find him is just . . . oh my. Why is that so moving?   <br /> <br />Several scenes are straight out of \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" -- the Monster Destroying the City scenes and the laundry scene at the end) -- funny and delightful.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ill admit some of the changes in the special edition weren't great namely greedo firing first and the new songs in return of the jedi.  but this dvd only serves to make the films look a little better and have better continuity.  Greedo fires first looks a lot better and the timing is more like they fire at the same time.  Jabba and the speeder looks way bettter in a new hope this time.  the emperor and boba fett are played by who they should be played by in empire strikes back.  and anakin appears as he appeared before he ceased to exist.  how could anakin have grown older.  as obi wan says anakin ceased to exist when he became vader.  ill admit it would be nice to have the originals as a bonus feature like on the alien quadrilogy discs, or at least have a comparison feature so you can see the original scenes that were changed like on Star Trek the motion picture, but the fact is the dvd makes all good changes, so stop whining about it.
0316172324|5.0|More detail might have been useful, but overall \\"Blink\\" does a reasonable job of describing and quantifying the once-elusive skill of \\"intuition.\\" Those who don't get it might do well to review Gavin de Becker's \\"Gift of Fear\\" or study the materials and research papers in the annotated bibliography.  <br /> <br />It is often said that muggers take about 7 seconds to size up potential victims. However, potential victims can be equally adept at recognizing threats. I saw this in South Side Pittsburgh a few months ago; a serial armed robber was apprehended because a clerk spotted \\"suspicious behavior\\" from across the street. What was this behavior? It wasn't waving a gun or screaming threats or looking like a character in a Spiderman comic strip with big teeth and a handful of chains and tire irons -- it was his simple failure to look like he had any destination and looking too long and lingering at passersby -- or their pockets and purses.  <br /> <br />\\"Blink\\" does not go into bad guys on the street as de Becker does. Nevertheless, he ranges through brand loyalty, prediction of divorce, and how we see each other -- for good or ill. It starts with gut responses to art forgeries (more reliable than the scientific testing) and ends with why music auditions are now conducted behind screens to the enormous benefit of female musicians who were once blinked out of competition.  <br /> <br />Loved \\"Tipping Point\\" and this is another excellent piece of work.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I recently bought this album.  I listened to it and I couldn't even finish the last two tracks!What is going on!!!!!!!!This is SYSTSEM OF A DOWN, one of my favorite bands.  I didn't even want to finish listening to the CD.  I am thoroughly disappointed.  I can not believe the music industry has somehow goten to this band!!!!  First of all  Malakian should not be singing so much backup; he's the guitarist. Serj is the vocalist, he has the signature \\"system\\" voice. I used to love system, and now listning to it gives me a deep sinking feeling...like the world is going to end.  The lyrics on most tracks just plain suck. They are repetative, and not even in a good way. What happened to the old System, the craziness, that made my heart and soul jump for joy.  They have always mixed in a political view into their music, but this time, it appears as though that is all that is left to their lyrics.. I now find myself listening to their songs wanting them to end, as apposed to willing them to continue! I thought I would never see this day! The only two songs that deserve to have the name \\"System of a Down\\" on there are BYOB and Cigaro, which is supprising because usually the radio songs are the ones that aren't as good as the frequently played onces. These two songs still have some of the REAL system sound, they have the political agenda, and they have the absolute \\"SYSTEM\\" nonsense craziness that is supposed to be there. The randomness excites me, and makes me laugh as I used to.     I would not advise buying this CD if you want to keep the REAL \\"System of a Down\\" in your mind. It will completely ruin their name.
B00003CWRX|5.0|I had come to expect good things from Michael Mann after seeing \\"Heat\\" and \\"Collatoral\\", and had heard that \\"The Insider\\" was also worth watching. I heard right as it is now my favorite film from Mann, the story is based on fact about one man who dared to go against the tobacoo company and lost everything because of it. One of the films many strengths are the superb performances by Crowe and Pacino(Duh), they seem as though they could be the actual people who went through the ordeals of all this. Half docudrama half psychological thriller this is a fantastic film not to be missed! My rating 9.5/10.
B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sabbaths trademark sound changes a little bit become more grungy and bleak. The guitar is overly distorted and fuzzy, instead of the pristine heavy metal tone it was in the previous albums. This album was the beginning of the downfall of Black Sabbath, the drugs were getting to them and from this album on it was a slow decline to the bottom. But nevertheless this is a great album. Hears what I think of the songs.    1.Wheels Of Confusion (5/5)-The whole song has a sort of Confused mood to it, a song about tripping out on acid  2.Tommorow's Dream (4.5/5)- A heavy riff, the song is kinda unfocused though  3.Changes (3/5)-An okay pop song, whatever its not like they sold out and started playing pop like many bands tend too do.  4.FX (1.5/5)- A weird instrumental of strange tapping noises, I guess you gotta be on acid or something to fully appreciate it.  5.Supernaut (5/5)-great original riff, very heavy  6.Snowblind (5/5)-the best song on the album, one of my favorite sabbath songs, Melodic but still maintains its heavyness  7.Cornacopia (3.5/5)  8. Laguna Sunrise (4.5/5)-A moody acoustic instrumental, theres no singing but the melody still paints an image in mind  9.St.Vitus Dance (4/5)- Good song, an iron man like riff  10.Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes (4/5)- A very bleak song, still good    If you like metal, or hard rock check this album out.    If you liked this album you may also like:  The Scorpions-Lonesome Crow  Uriah Heep-The Magicians Birthday  Judas Priest-Sad Wings Of Destiny  Alice Cooper-Billion Dollar Babies
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Although the writer of Time Machine had a good idea, he failed to follow it through the end. Which left us the audience with one word on our now befuddled minds. Huh?<br /><br />Yes Huh, for I couldn't make heads or tails of the movie, and boredom that ran through my foggy brain didn't help any. Yes the CGI was good, but does computer enhanced graphics really make up for bad story plots? The answer no, as this movie clearly shows us.<br /><br />A true rendition of H.G Wells story this is not, and for fans of his works I have to say don't bother with this movie. Wait a few more years until someone gets the right idea on how to follow through with Well's original story.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I received this as a gift.  I have \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" permanently mounted in my car CD player.  The only song on that CD I bypass is \\"Sands of Nevada\\".  I expected something that good for Shangri-La.  I was immediately disappointed.  5:15 was blah, \\"Boom, Like That\\" was OK, \\"Sucker Row\\" was blah, \\"The Trawlerman's song\\" was good, \\"Back to Tupelo\\" was OK, \\"Our Shangri-La\\" was OK, \\"Everybody Pays\\" was blah, \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" was good, \\"Whoop De Doo\\" was good, \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" was good\\", \\"All That Matters\\" was OK, \\"Stand Up Guy\\" was OK, \\"Donegan's Gone\\" was fun, and \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance\\" was offensive. <br /> <br />I've played the CD in my car several times since then.  Now, I skip the first three, the ones I listed as good I REALLY like now, the ones that were OK, are good now or better, and I skip the last one as it is still offensive. <br /> <br />This CD is not as good as \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" but it still ranks as one of the better CD's I own, and \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" is my favorite from this CD.  I am not disappointed that I have this CD, in fact I am happy to have it.  However, it definitely has to grow on you to be appreciated.

6304712944|5.0|<br />I enjoyed \\"Camelot\\" from the very moment the title came onscreen, in big red lettering. The focus of the musical is on the destructive love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and on the idealized and idyllic lost world that was once Camelot. Despite the sense of loss, it ends on a hopeful note, that one day, Camelot may rise again. Pay attention to the little boy at the end of the movie: his name is Tom, he is from Warwickshire, and he is knighted by Arthur. I'm pretty sure this is an allusion to Sir Thomas Malory, author of Le Morte Darthur, the indirect source for \\"Camelot,\\" and who was also a knight and from Warwickshire. Moreover, Malory wrote \\"Le Morte Darthur\\" out of a nostalgic and idealistic vision of knighthood, so the idealistic little boy, who still believes in Camelot, almost certainly represents him. <br /> <br />Much of the story is told through the songs. The songs are wonderful, and I enjoyed all of them, but \\"The simple joys of Maidenhood,\\" \\"I loved you once in silence,\\" \\"The Lusty Month of May,\\" \\"Then You May Take Me to the Fair\\" and of course \\"Camelot,\\" (including its reprise at the close of the film, with different lyrics), are simply amazing. And it's not just the music. The lyrics are marvelous.  <br /> <br />One reviewer writes that he is disappointed with the singing. I can imagine that after seeing the play with Julie Andrews in New York, one has every right to feel that way. Vanessa Redgrave is not Julie Andrews, to be sure, but she looks beautiful on screen, and her singing is more than OK, as is the singing of Richard Harris (Arthur. It could have been better, but it is enjoyable as it is. Incidentally, both Richard Harris and the young blue-eyed Franco Nero look very good, each in his own way.  <br /> <br />This DVD has been digitally remastered, and as a result, the image is simply superb! The settings are splendid and almost overwhelming.  <br /> <br />\\"Camelot\\" is so good, and so enchanting, that after watching it for the first time till the late hours of the night, I decided to watch some of it again for a while, I just couldn't part with it. Give yourself a treat and buy this DVD, you couln't go wrong with it! <br />
B000002UEB|5.0|The only thing I can say about this release is that it is nothing short of perfection -- it is utterly flawless.  I bought this CD over a decade ago, and I can't go for long without listening to at least one track.  Its resonance is just as potent as it was then.  The political, religious, psychological and sexual undercurrents are supplemented by some of the most powerful and complex music I have ever heard.  The motifs presented in O:M have managed to withstand the test of time; if anything, they seem to be even more relevant today than ever before.  The album is incredibly dramatic, and Geoff Tate has the unique ability to transition the listener through a wide range of emotions through his voice alone.  Not to say that the rest of the band was busy twiddling their thumbs - quite the contrary.  Exceptional vocals & intelligent lyrics are simply not enough to create a timeless piece. The superlative musicianship on O:M speaks for itself. If you are reading this review in an effort to decide whether or not you should buy O:M, stop whatever it is you are doing and BUY IT NOW!  Soon, you'll be among those of us who are fortunate enough to say that we have witnessed absolute greatness!   <br /> <br />
0316172324|3.0|I was interested in the premise of this book, that we can \\"know without knowing why we know\\" and can utilize this hunch in making decisions. Gladwell provides many interesting anecdotes (at times you feel like you're reading the good parts of an intro to psychology text), but that's really all he does. He doesn't leap to anything in the way of conclusions or exercises to further experience this phenomenon. Of course, once we become aware of our \\"adaptive subconscious,\\" we begin to tread on tenuous territory, muddling precisely on what we focus. So, you really can't fault him for that; he's doing all he can by providing what he does.     Overall, I enjoyed \\"Blink\\" and would recommend it as a light read. It does make for good discussions and personal revelations. I myself wish I would have several times listened to that \\"blink\\" subconscious, intead of opening up the Pandora's box of other options. My only criticism is that Gladwell becomes a little repetitive at times and the book itself begins to drag. But not that big of a deal.
B000002H70|5.0|I bought the Cure's Disintegration because of its popular singles (Lullaby, Fascination Street, Pictures Of You and Lovesong). I was very, very impressed. Opens with Plainsong, that will set you in the mood for the album: The drums sound as if Boris Williams was flying somewhere, it appears to be the whole band is in the sky instead of touching the ground while playing. Robert Smith plays constant riffs throughout the album, and they are catchy and are one of the reasons this is so great. The basslines are also really amazing -- All three guitars (Two leads and a bass) on Lullaby and Fascination Street are awesome. Robert's vocals are beautiful. Hands down to the keyboard player, whose name I can't remember right now, because its his playing what puts the other guys in the sky. <br /> <br />In some of my reviews, I give songs a rating out of 10. I can't do that for this one. All the songs are classics, and they sound even better when they're together in this album. All the songs have got something I love. My favourites ... My second favourite is The Same Deep Water As You, the band is playing in such an emotional way this song gives me a strange feeling, I love this. And after the depressing ending to it, Disintegration comes in, my favourite song here. It is so amazing, and all its little details, though not as exploited as in the delicate previous song, are what makes this album so great. <br /> <br />I can't explain with words how I feel towards this album. I've never felt the same thing I feel about this with any other. It's so great. This, my friends, is quality music. Highly recommended. My favourite album of all time.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Ok.. this is my first time ever typing out something that i consider an assignment in which i didn't have too, but for these guys i'll do it anyways! I think it is important i critque this album. Read along. I remember hearing about System from my amigos way back then like in 8th grade when they saw them at Ozzfest in S.A. and unfortunately i didn't go, when they got back they were all siked about having heard them so i bought the cd with them without ever hearing them before, and iam glad i did. From there self-titled to there new sh*t now, there style as changed a bit, but one thing i can rely on is that they always have a solo that will just blow-your mind!  <br /> <br />SOAD is one of my favorite bands right now, along with (311) but thats a way different category in music. System's new CD \\"Mezmerize\\" proves that they are talented musicians which i have always known for a long time.  I'am now a sophmore in college and there music has inspired me throughout highschool partying and i will continue to listen to them.  Mezmerize is a good cd that has one song leading into another, and all sorts of vibrant changes throughout.  Daron(guitarist) sings alot on this cd now and even Serj picks up a guitar on this cd.  The melody in Serj's voice along with the music is what makes this band appeal to people and so original.  Some great highlights are \\"B.Y.O.B\\"  \\"Revenga\\"  \\"Radio/Video\\" \\"Violent Pornography\\" \\"Question\\" and \\"Old School Hollywood\\" <br /> <br />\\"Question\\" reminds me of Steal This Album-and \\"Old School Hollywood\\" reminds of that gay sound effect that Limp Bizkit did on there cd before there recent one with that song behind blue eyes or something like that, but SOAD makes that effect sound way better and fit better in the song than Limp Bizkit did in theres. <br /> <br />All in all i know how everyone wanted this cd to compete with there first 2 cds, well it sure came close.  Toxicity was great and i think that this cd has a lot of potential to be greater than Toxicity, but for me i think that there self-titled was there best. Driving drunk to this cd when i first got it was cool i felt the Mezmerize experience!!lol these guys are the cooolest and i hope they never stop making music i love them!! peace stay positive <br />frankie d.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|HIGH VOLTAGE is by far my favorite Bon Scott era album from these mates. Voltage was one of my first AC/DC albums, and it is probably the most pure, unadultarated and direct rock 'n' roll album i'v ever listened to in my life. Not Aerosmith, nor Kiss, not Zepplin or anyone else has put out a rock album THIS fine. This was the first american release from the band, which came out in 1976 to be exact. It should be known that they had released their real first album called TNT in 74 and their second album called HIGHVOLTAGE in 75, which were only availble out side of America. This version is a more of a compilation of those two publicly unavailable albums (74 Jailbreak has the songs that never made it to this american release, almost). Still, this is classic! i have this on vinly and it still sounds as wonderful as it did when it was first pressed. TNT, IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP, LIVE WIRE, CAN I SIT NEXT TO YOU GIRL and HIGHVOLTAGE are the best songs. It is worth it for Bon Scott alone, just hearing his snearing and charisma is awesome.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|to give this album 5 stars is absurd- how? why? YOU KNOW ITS HORRIBLE PROG- ITS DIFFERENT- ITS NOT WHAT TRUE ST FANS WANT- IT WAS WRITTEN IN 3 FREAKIN WEEKS- IT SHOWS- MAN- TO GIVE THIS 5 STARS- HECK- I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT 2 STARS- BUT JUST TO SPITE THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ILL GIVE IT ONE. <br />BAD- BAD- BAD! PROGRESSIVE MUSIC <br />DAMN I USED TO LOVE THIS BAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0066620996|2.0|Its very simple why MOST companies don't become great.  They dont want to !!  Its alot cheaper to just edge out your competition (if you even have to), than to start a price war, or any other kind of war.  Also, most companies are clueless, since they cant tell the difference between an investment, and a cost.  They would rather not invest in their people because, they either might take the jobs of the one who taught them, or go somewhere else, and get paid a higher salary, from a company that didnt have to invest in them, so then that other company can then steal what they didnt have to invest in.  Lets face it, the company with the lowest cost wins.  That one statement explains everything else.  There will never be greatness as long as this is true.  The race to the botton, trumps the race to the top.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|this cd should be put in the comedy section- i love rock- but this sucks- plain sucks
B000003TAW|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been said before about the Blue Album? <br /> <br />Do I really need to tell you why I gave this 5 stars? No. But it deserves another 5 star rating. There can never be enough. <br /> <br />This album is absolutely flawless and is, without a doubt, my favorite album of all time. Regardless of what you may think of their recent efforts (which I happen to love, by the way), this is the album that started it all and there's not one bad moment on it.  <br /> <br />If you don't have it, get it. If you've got a few extra bucks, get the deluxe edition.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I bought this on Tuesday, and I've been listening to it non-stop ever since. SOAD is my favorite band and I've been waiting too long for their next CD, well it was well worth the wait. <br /> <br />The CD starts with Soldier Side, it gets its message across, but I wish it couldv'e been longer, even if it's the intro. The music and vocals are just too good for it to be a minute long. Then BYOB quickly crashes in. <br /> <br />Every song on this album is distinguished and different from the other, BYOB has a funk/R&B sound to it, while Radio/Video is an excellent ska vibe going on. Every track is excellent, and get better with each listen thank to Daron's pulse-pounding riffs, and Serj's loud and harmonic voice. <br /> <br />I love how SOAD changes their sound with each album, it keeps them fresh and original. And face it everybody, they're one of the most original bands to come out in the past decade. <br /> <br />At first I was a bit skeptical about Daron having a bigger part in vocals this time around, but after listening to songs like Lost in Hollywood, I was completely wrong. Though, I still prefer Serj as lead, and Daron as back-up. <br /> <br />Everyone stop complaining how short this album is...if you do some research you'll find that their self-titled album is on like 4 minutes longer than this, Toxicity is like 8 minutes longer, and Steal This Album! is like 6 minutes longer. Unless your complaining that you never wanted this work of brilliance to end, then I can accept that. <br /> <br />I'm still trying to decide if this is their 2nd best album, Self-Titled being the first, but it has to compete with Toxicity which is a hard task. I have a feeling that this will become my favorite SOAD album when the 2nd half, Hypnotize comes out this September. <br /> <br />BEST SONGS: <br /> <br />Lost in Hollywood <br />Radio/Video <br />Revenga <br />This Cocaine is Making Feel Like I'm on this Song <br />Violent Pornography <br /> <br />screw it, every song is incredible <br /> <br />GO BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!! <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album blew me away! i never really bothered with NIN before, but when i heared the hand that feeds i needed to get this cd! It has its fast, hard, soft, and slow parts, everything that is needed in a good band. Lets get to the rating <br /> <br />1. \\"All The Love In The World\\" A good intro like song, slow and industrial like with good lyrics. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. \\"You Know What You Are?\\" Fast with heavy focus on the drums, kinda of a childish song when you look at the lyrics, but still good 7/10 <br /> <br />3. \\"The Collector\\" Medium pace with emphasis on the bass, good lyrics, good song! 10/10 <br /> <br />4. \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" A very industrial song, nice pace, good lyrics. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" Pretty good song, not one of the best, but still good. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" Slow, good instrumentals and good lyrics. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />7. \\"With Teeth\\" Strange song, and Strange instrumentals. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. \\"Only\\" Vocals are the emphesis here, this song is my favorite, odd lyrics, great song 11/10 <br /> <br />9. \\"Getting Smaller\\" Kinda a energetic song, good instrumentals, good lyrics. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. \\"Sunspots\\" Slow song, good lyrics, good instrumentals, another diplay of talent. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" good song, should've been track 12 though, sounds more like an outtro. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. \\"Beside You In Time\\" the studdering gets annoying, but still an okay song 7.5/10 <br /> <br />13. \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" Instrumentals have the sad and soft effect on them, this song does work for its place, there is cheering near the ending, but i don't think its live, very good ending though (although my CD player is on loop when this CD is in it so it never really ends). 10/10 <br /> <br />Theres only one thing i didn't like, and that is that tracks 11 and 12 seem to be backwards, \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" Should've been track 12 and \\"Beside You In Time\\" track 11

0684801558|5.0|fitgerald describes things so well and in such a light that after a while is contagous.  i read the great gatby a couple years ago and didnt remember being greatly interested but i love this book. i recommend it more for the way the author writes then the mere plot.
B0006399FS|5.0|I know a lot of U2 fans out there seem to be disappointed with their latest album, HTDAAB, but I'm not.  I think it's almost a throw back to their 80s albums, which is a good thing.  City Of Blinding Lights, in particular, has the classic U2 sound which really takes me back to the good old 80s.  Vertigo is a rocker, with catchy, clever lyrics.  Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own is a nice sentimental sort of song, which I believe Bono wrote about his dad, who passed away in 2001.  Love And Peace Or Else is a great song about something which any rational person hopes for in our crazy world .. \\"Lay down your guns/All you daughters of Zion/All you Abraham's sons\\".  The album closes out with Yahweh, which is a song which is really a prayer to God.  All in all, a great effort by what is still a great band!
0385006896|5.0|You don't need any more if you are looking for all the stories of the most famous detective.<br /><br />Though the type is a tinny one, a must have for the book lover.
B000002ZR7|5.0|Maybe we are so familiar with JSB's Goldberg Var. playing by G. Gould (or some other pianists like Hewitt, Schiff, Perahia...), but here is another one. Tatiana plays these Vars. is so different, I think it's more feminine. I specially like she plays the aria, the sound is lovely. S. Richter had denied to played this Var. after listened to G. Gould, but I believe he could be regret after Tatiana played.     If you are a fan of JSB and love the Goldberg Var., you must have this CD. One other, very special, is Gavrilov Bach's Goldberg Variations. So, G. Gould (1955), Tatiana, and Gavrilov had made 3 best Bach's Goldberg Variations. As a rare issue, Maria Yudina had played Bach's Vars. in a beautiful way (and this is must have, too *-)
1592400876|4.0|As an English learner, this book is very ilustrative.<br /><br />It review the subjects you usually learn in English courses, but in a more relaxed way.<br /><br />It could be no funny for some people, could be unintersting for others. The style could be better, but it help you to get the picture of the importance of the punctuation used adecuately.
B000002MJR|5.0|On The Night is a really great rock album! It is a must-have for <br />any rock fan in my opinion! It rocks so hard that I would like <br />to buy another additional copie to it! My favorites would be Calling Elvis (10 min track), Walk of Life, Heavy Fuel, Money <br />for Nothing, & Brothers in Arms. I love this version of Brothers in Arms, and I think it is even better than the studio but they're both great. I'll review all these songs in an order. <br /> <br />Calling Elvis 10/10, Great concert album opener! This version's <br />just as good as the other but maybe harder rockin' than the other. It is over 10 minutes. <br /> <br />Walk of Life 11/10, Way better than the studio! This version has <br />a harder rockin' sound to it! And it is a really good tune. One <br />of my favorites on this live album. <br /> <br />Heavy Fuel 11/10, All I can say is great! This version is just as <br />great as the studio version of the song! Maybe better! Listen to <br />it. It will rock you because it is so hard rockin' that you will <br />want to play it over N' over again. <br /> <br />Romeo and Juliet 8/10, I hate all those crowds cheering for the <br />song, it really is noisy! But the piano is even better than the <br />studio. It'll make you bang. <br /> <br />Private Investigations 2/10 I've never liked this song and I dont <br />care about it at all. <br /> <br />Your Last Trick 7/10 It is okay! I hate the trumpets. But I do <br />like the rock ending!  <br /> <br />On Every Street 5/10 The other version is slightly better. <br /> <br />You and Your Friend 5/10 The other version is slightly better. <br /> <br />Money for Nothing 9/10 Listen to it, it is just as good as the <br />other version! Sting dosent sing \\"I want my MTV\\" very well in this version as the other version. But it is a heck of a great <br />version. <br /> <br />Brothers in Arms 10/10 Way better than the studio version! But <br />they're both good! I love the riff and it is even better though <br />thestorm is not as good as the studio. Great album closer.  <br /> <br />gO out and buy it today
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Yes, Daron is a brilliant song writer and i think a musical genius, but why does he feel the need to not let any other member shine? i wonder how that convo went through with the band: <br /> <br />Serj: Hey Daron, when we gonna get in the studio? it's been a little while since we've gotten stuff out there... <br /> <br />Daron: Oh, uh, yeah. About that. Well, we're releasing an album. In about a week. <br /> <br />Serj: Wha? What about the rest of- <br /> <br />Daron: Oh, no. dont worry about it. I've got everything covered. I wrote all the tunes and made sure my guitar and whiny vocals overpower everything else on the two records that i've decided to release at separate times to insure maximum profit. Because you know how bad gas prices are these days, and sine I drive a Hummer... <br /> <br />Serj: WTF?!?! YOU DID WHAT?! <br /> <br />Daron: woah, easy. like i said, dont worry about it. As a matter of fact, i need your help. I need you to come into the studio tomorrow and do some backup vocals for me... <br /> <br /> <br />I wanna hear SYSTEM OF A DOWN, NOT SYSTEM OF A DARON!
0312330529|5.0|WOW!  From one of the best first pages in literature to a story that could not have been imagined Gregory Roberts has given the world an incredible gift that should not be missed by anyone who loves to read.  It is now on my list of the top 100 books that readers should not miss.
B000002TQV|5.0|Listen to the CD a while and you'll start saying Radiohead in a hushed voice. This is one of their best CDs alongside OK Computer and Hail to the Thief. If you dont have any Radiohead CDs, this one is probably a good place to start. All the songs are great, but \\"Street Spirit\\" is one of the best ending songs on any CD.
B000008FIR|4.0|\\"Waiting for the Roar\\" is another great album by one of the best \\"forgotten\\" hair-metal band's of the 1980's. Fastway was just a great band, and I was always waiting for them to break into that upper echelon of metal bands and join the ranks of Ratt, Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. Just give their self titled debut a listen, or their soundtrack to the 80's horror flick \\"Trick or Treat\\" and you too will wonder why these guys didn't become a household name?! \\"Waiting for the Roar\\" isn't their strongest album, but it's still a great disc. I would love to have heard some of these songs performed live, especially \\"The World Waits for You\\". I guarantee that once you hear that opening guitar line you will be hooked. You won't be able to get the catchy chorus out of your head either! If you enjoy 80's metal, then try to find this album at a decent price. (I wouldn't recommend spending the $100 listed here for used copies) In the mean time pick up some of the other discs that are readily available from this band, you won't be disappointed.
0316776963|5.0|Dave Sedaris is a consistently funny writer and this book is about his really wierd misadventures. His dry wit seems to make even the most mundane stuff exciting. If you like audiobooks, get that instead of the paperback because its read by the author and his dismal voice makes it more personal.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is a great mind-bender of a movie. It borrows heavily from David Lynch but in all the right ways. If you are a Twin Peaks fan, Donnie Darko will give you a fix.<br />It is one of those few movies where after you finish watching it you want and need to watch it again just to figure half of it out.<br />The dialogue and acting is excellent with one exception. It won't take you too long to figure that one out (hint: it's the one who lacks the ability to act...)<br />Well worth it for fans of the bizarre and obscure.
B000000WA4|5.0|In my view no one artist has ever released as much quality music as these guys.From the almost psychadelic rock of gish through to the hard rock of mellon collie and right through to the goth-esque sound of the last records the pumpkins have never failed to deliver.And this being their penultimate record shows why, 28 tracks and not one of them a filler.Its all too easy to come across bands that get away with just the \\"hey just throw that track on there\\" attitudes,But thanks to Corgan being the perfectionist that he is he never allowed this to happen.Although in my view this isnt the pumpkins best album its by far the most praised,Its 28 tracks of pure genius from the piano instrumental at the beginning of disc 1 right through to the last Chords of Farewell and goodnight.Throught out this the pumpkins take you through a journey of Emptiness,Angst,Sadness,Happiness and wonder.So many forgot about about this band in the wake of(the most overrated band of all time)Nirvana but the pumpkins fans knew exactly where the real magic was.
0312330529|5.0|i read it 2 months ago and now i'm walking around bookshops looking for my next book. you will never read a book like this....an incredible life told truly and the standard of writing ranks with literature....but enjoy every page because  <br />it is going to be impossible to replicate....a book that will stay with you for a very long time...BRAVO!
B00000FYIL|5.0|Even though the release of the movie, which had me enraptured, is now six years in the past, I still enjoy listening to this soundtrack as much as ever. <br />After having seen the film I listened to the listening samples of the soundtrack available online over and over; the melodies really haunted me and I wanted desperately to be transported back into the escapist world of Shakespeare in Love by listening to its music. The Soundtrack, which I then bought, enabled me to do so over and over again, but over the years I find it has qualities beyond those linked to the motion picture, and it has become one of my favorite CDs to read, study and relax by.  <br />Anyone who loved the film will enjoy remembering it by means of the music, and re-experiencing the fun, fast, multi-layered, stimulating and inspiring story again (and again and again).
B00008LDPU|5.0|Finally the ground breaking movie Heavy Metal has a sequel worthy of it.
B00003CXE7|4.0|There is a new DVD of this excellent film coming out in August. GO to DVD town for more details.    For those people who do not speak, write or understand Spanish, here is a full translation of the review above this one:    A Caesar with something of common sense would not have an option: Gladiator deserves the sign of APPROVED, not with one, but with two thumbs up.      With digital technology of last tip, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us of return the glory that was Rome.  Never lit up so densely affluent; so extravagantly decadent.      On the verge of dying, the emperor Marcus Aurelius decides of naming as his successor to Maximus, general of his army, with the hope that he protect to Rome and he return the power to the town.  But its ambitious, determined son Commodus to comply not the will of his father will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire.  Maximus should survive to the jealous ire of , the murder of its family and the infamy to be a slave.  But it will be just like a gladiator that Maximus will find the way to serve again to Rome and to comply the done promise with the dead Marcus Aurelius.      The epic movies returned to the large thing.  Reviving all the pomp and ceremony of the old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle them with extraordinary battles, scenes of realistic fight and some admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.      Russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator; a combination of brain, muscles and noble soul, that places him in the same rank of Kirk Douglas in Spartacus or Charlton Heston in Ben Hur.  His Maximum is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.      The remainder of the distribution is magnificent, since the selection of Joaquin Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy they are palpable, to Richard Harris in their small but stunning role of Marcus Aurelius.  Every actor is excellent: Oliver Reed (who passed away some days before culminating the filming), proud as the former gladiator Proximus, Connie Nielsen in the role of Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou like Juba and the veteran one Derek Jacobi, as the senator Gracchus.      Under the right hand direction of Ridley Scott -who removes the best of the hyphen supported by a range of technological tools- Gladiator succeeds to find a perfect balance between action and emotion.  His main focus is in the personages and the flow of a history that captures the importance of our actions.  Its protagonists emit vitality, in the country of battle, in the bloody sand and above all, they convince us completely that is worth while to live or to die for the values and ideal that we carry inside.
B0002858YS|4.0|I really do love this CD. I can enjoy every track the drummer really puts the boom behind this album, every single beat of the measure (music is made up of measures, usually 4 beats each) is accented keeping the beat going and not lagging in the least. <BR>/1/ and /2/ and /3/ and /4/ and, /1/... etc...<BR>The singer is good and oh, the agony. Pounding my heart out. Wonderful stuff, puts me in a trance.
B000003TAB|5.0|Nirvana's 3rd album may not live up to Nevermind....but that does not stop it from being a great rock album. Yes, this album does \\"sag\\" a bit in the middle but with songs like Dive, Sliver, Aneursym, and Big Long Now......this album rocks out hard...with great guitar and Bass. Although, only a true Nirvana fan can experience this album in whole, a new fan can also enjoy this album. Nirvana is a great band, and Incesticide is a great album from a great band.
B0008ISM40|4.0|This is not trents best work, but still great.  At first it was a little disapointing but it grows on you. Over all a good album with some amazing songs.  \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is worth buying the album by itself, and \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\" is also amazing.  I suggest the dualdisc version.  The Album is better in 5.1.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Production wise this album is a treat throughout. Kanye's style behind the boards are reminiscent of hip hop in it's heyday, which in my opionion was the mid 90's..which is both sample heavy, and often very soulful with his own personal quirks. I wouldn't be surprised if he does indeed go down in history as one of the greatest musical forces in the genre. He's still still young, and still a lot of room for growth.<br /><br />Kanye as a rapper though. ha. hehe.. HAHAHAHAHA.<br /><br />please.<br /><br />Ok, to be fair he's not THAT bad. He occasionally get's lucky with a nice line here and a cool thought here..and is humorous at times, but over all ...he ain't a lyricist. Don't expect anything amazing really. Jesus Walks is probably his best track lyrically..that and maybe the last song, in which afterwards he talks about how he got started.<br /><br />good production + blah lyrics = 3 stars
0767802470|5.0|If this isn't a great move, it is certainly the greatest submarine movie ever made. For three and a half hours (which goes by quickly), we get to feel the claustrophobia of being on a submarine in this hyper-realistic film that is extremely well made. You need to approach this very long film as if it was a huge novel. it may be long but there isn't a wasted minute. I enjoyed this very much.
068987474X|3.0|It's painful when a woman likes a man and he doesn't return the feelings.  I think the authors realize this, and have produced a book that is is honest and surprisingly upbeat.<br /><br />But some day someone needs to write a book when it's the other way around. Sometimes a man likes a woman who doesn't return the favor.  Do we ever see any books about that subject?  (Hey!  Maybe I've got myself a new project!)<br /><br />I guess my biggest problem with the book is that it gives the impression that women think about nothing else but acquiring a husband.  When I was single I thought about marriage a lot, but I also was busy with my work and my many hobbies and interests.  There were lots of fish to fry and I was having a great time.<br /><br />In fact, there were some guys who probably thought I was not into THEM!
B0000CBY24|5.0|This wonderful film was based on a novel by Witi Ihimaera, and directed by Nikki Caro. Shot in New Zealand, the film is about a girl who must fulfill her destiny as the leader of a Maori tribe in spite of the strong opposition she faces from her grandfather, a man with inflexible beliefs about the traditional roles of women in his society. Love and rejection are the main topics of the film, as the girl struggles to convince her grandfather that she is the one destined to ride the whales, the spiritual guardians of the tribe. The acting in Whale Rider is excellent, and the music, photography and sets are simply superb.  <br />Keisha Castle-Hughes provides a very strong performance as the determined girl. You can see her next in Star Wars Revenge of the Sith.
B000003TAW|5.0|I can't begin to describe the feeling I get whenever I hear those opening finger picking notes on the acoustic guitar ridden song \\"My name is Jonas.\\" The Blue album is the apex of what music means to me. All the tracks are phenomenally written Pop gems. This album will never get old to me. I'm buying a copy for my nephew when he turns 8 years old. I was 8 years old in 1994 when it came out. Don't listen to a single negative review of the blue album if you ever come across one. This is music from a great band that hit it right on the head with this release. Go and buy Blue, you will not be dissapointed in the LEAST bit.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a brilliant phycology student with a troubled past and wants to free himself from his disturbing childhood memories. As a kid, he often blacked out for long periods of time and decided to detail his life in a series of journals. As a young adult, he revisits the journal entries to figure out the truth about his troubled childhood friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). Traumatic episodes in the journal transports him back in time in order to set things right, he tries to save his beloved friends. However, he finds out that undoing the past is not really possible and that relatively minor changes can bring along major problems for the future.  <br /> <br />A look at what could happen if time travel would be a possibility, and the inevitable effects on the present if tampered with the past <br />
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is the first Dream Theater CD I have ever purchased and I am relatively new to progressive rock and metal as well. I find this CD to be very entertaining with incredible solos and some awesome heavy guitar riffs. Although I looked at many reviews for this album and found them to mention that this album isn't good. I think that the guitarist is amazing and so are the lyricks and the drums. I think this CD is really good however  it may be different from other Dream Theater albums before it. My favorite songs on it are As I Am and This Dying Soul because both are really heavy and have a lot of interesting moments.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Billy Crudup plays William Bloom, a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward (Albert Finney) outside of the tall tales he told about growing up, making his way, and meeting his mother played as a young woman by Alison Lohman and in older age by Jessica Lange. During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) hold bedside vigil as the old man recollects elaborate memories of his youth (in which he is played by Ewan McGregor). Still doubting the the legends and folklore, William makes a journey to meet a mysterious woman (Helena Bonham Carter) from whom Edward had bought property. <br />All the tales now seems to not be as far fetched as first believed. <br />An entertaining story with a refreshing twist.  <br />Also starring Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I've always thought SOAD was cool but a bit strange. I heard the single B.Y.O.B. and some of the other songs on a local station. I had to get the album so I got it the day it came out. I love it but it's too damn short. I guess since the next cd is coming out in like 6 months it will do. My favorite songs are B.Y.O.B., Revenga, Radio/Video, and Violent Pornography but all the songs, except #'s 1,8 and 11, are great. I highly recomend this cd.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 7th grade. I love this album. I still listen to this album to this day. She was filled with self-discovery, wrote over half of the 13 songs on this album. She offered insight into her tumultuous world where life is not always flowers and chocolate. She wrote songs that displayed her vocal ability and love of the pop side of R&B at a feverish pace. Her debut single There U GO placed her on the map to success.<br />This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember,this was 1999-2000.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Really excellent, I discovered Jarre when I was 5 (with this album !) and more than 20 years after this is one of my favourites ! If you haven't heard of JMJ before (despite his mega-concerts), buy it and listen to it. You won't regret.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I remember this album when I was 12. This album is wonderful from beginning to the end. This album is about her traveling on the 6 train. Coming from the cradle of hip-hop and Latin hip-hop movements, it's no surprise that great beats also motivates her. It is that compass, musically and spiritually that guides this album.  With a seamless skill at singing ballads, R&B, and dance music, She showed promise. This album has been certified 3x Platinum. This was 1999-2000.
B00008BRDX|4.0|Having jumped on the Police bandwagon when I was in eighth grade back when SYNCHRONICITY came out, I've really enjoyed rediscovering this music recently after pursuing different kinds of music far and wide. But you always go back to the best[I think this review tees the bejesus out of someone at Amazon!]. Their signature sound melding reggae to rock has been enormously influential even though they weren't the first band to do this. Also Sting's lyrics are some of the most intelligent in rock. Every player is enormously talented.<br /><br />When the Police were making this album, they were touring extensively and hadn't written enough material for a new one. As a result, several of these compositions were \\"forced\\" to fill the void. Drummer Stuart Copeland contributed the weakest songs here, making it clear why bassist Sting was the primary songwriter. Still, the Police sound greatly evolved from OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR (their debut), fantastic as that album is. Sting wrote some of his best songs in \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" \\"Bring on the Night,\\" \\"Walking on the Moon\\" and \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You.\\"<br /><br />Some impressions:<br /><br />\\"Message in the Bottle\\" - a rock classic and one of their best live tunes. *****<br /><br />\\"Reggatta de Blanc\\" - a great instrumental with lyric-less vocals from Sting. Not a forced composition, the Police kicked this one around live quite a bit before recording it.\\" ****1/2<br /><br />\\"It's Alright for You\\" - Sting co-wrote this one with Stuart Copeland. A good, energetic song. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Bring on the Night\\" - Sting acquired a knack for subtle sophistication with this album and this song is a prime example. *****<br /><br />\\"Deathwish\\" - totally infectious cut. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Walking on the Moon\\" - has a spacey, ethereal quality that really conveys what it must feel like to walk on the moon. *****<br /><br />\\"On Any Other Day\\" - the weakest song on RdB. Written and sung by Stuart who's vocals are frankly annoying to me, but it's well-played and has a good reggae-rock vibe. **1/2<br /><br />\\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" - hypnotic, soulful plea for a lost lover. Played with speed but it conveys a subdued power. *****<br /><br />\\"Contact\\" - the best song here that's written by Copeland, thankfully sung by Sting. ****<br /><br />\\"Does Everyone Stare\\" - This Copeland tune guided by piano isn't horrible, but it drags quite a bit. I do love that opera voice buried in the mix. He would go on to write some great music though - I especially love \\"Darkness\\" from GHOST IN THE MACHINE. ***<br /><br />\\"No Time This Time\\" - a telling title, but it's a frantic blast of energy. ***1/2<br /><br />When I first heard Sting sing on the radio, I thought it was a Mexican singing in English because of his peculiar pronunciations (Attn. P.C. tight-wads - stop reading now). I've heard plenty of people with accents like that when I lived in Texas. Elvis Costello claimed Sting sung in a \\"ridiculous Jamaican accent\\" but I think my interpretation is closer. My thinking was vindicated when I met a Hispanic guy recently who thought the same thing when he first heard Sting sing.<br /><br />P.S. - why get this CD when you can just purchase MESSAGE IN A BOX that has all of their fantastic original albums, plus virtually all of their other studio recordings, including some great stuff from the Brimstone & Treacle Soundtrack? It's one of the great early box sets and it's a really good deal.Too Big Without You\\" - hypnotic, soulful plea for a lost lover.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 9th grade. I love this album. It is a classic pop record. On this album,Pink unveils a stunning new voice on the music scene,her own true voice. She astonished her legions of dedicated fans as well as critics who applauded her boldness. Her musical ambition was greeted with skepticism. The old school analog M!ssundaztood oozes with raw emotion,from the sugarless romance of \\"Eventually and \\"Just Like A Pill\\" to the heart-wrenching \\"Dear Diary\\" and \\"Family Portrait\\" from the introspective \\"My Vietnam\\" and \\"M!ssundaztood\\" to the rock anthem \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\". Her musical ambition was greeted at first blush with skepticism. This album has been certified 4x Platinum. Remember,this was 2001-2002.
0060005688|4.0|I wanted to buy this,and then looked to see that there were 20 other books on the same subject. Couldn't make up my mind, so I didn't buy any of them. <br />Great book.

She is trying to be a mother, wife, employee, and a friend alll at the same time and she is failing them all. So starts her journey to see what is more important to Kate and what she might have to give to have it all.<br /><br />This is the first book by Allison Pearson and after seeing her on the \\"Today Show\\" when the book first came out I couldn't wait to read it. The beginning was good, but I found the ending to be a neat. Ms. Pearson seem wrap up the story just a little too well. But for a plane ride or a day at the beach this book will do nicely.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Being a nonconformist by nature, and being a 20 year old in a culture of \\"worship our pop idols and don't question what big brother says,\\" I had bought this album three years ago, at age seventeen. I was under tremendous pressure by my peer groups that had rejected me. I wanted to be cool.    I bought Britney Spear's album, \\"Britney.\\" A year later, when I embraced my natural nonconformity, I was so angry that I had bought this album in order to fit in, that I bent the CD until it broke.     As far as this product goes, I never so accurately gave a one star rating on Amazon. The songs I remember most were, \\"I'm a slave 4 U,\\" \\"Not a girl, not yet a woman,\\" and \\"Boys.\\" In \\"I'm a slave 4 U\\" Britany's voice sounds like (forgive me, but this is accurate) an operator on a phone sex line. In \\"Not a girl, not yet a woman\\" Britany claims to be in some sort of transitional phase. She sings \\"All I need is time, for a moment that is mine, while I'm imbetween.\\" Could we please have a bit more depth here? The lyrics rhyme to be sure, but do they convey a moving emotion deeper than some sort of pre-adolescant angst? Is this the best pop culture in my generation can do? Are there no Beetles, BeeGees; is there no Marvin Gaye?     My generation seems all but hopeless in the search for originality and deeper meanings with what supposedly is art. Though there have been plenty of examples of profitable money making art, I am sure that art has nothing to do with money. Britany Spears is a tragic corporate pawn who has been exploited by the music industry. I wish her well on her child, but can't pop culture have some dignity?    Oscar Wilde has said more than a hundred years ago that \\"the supreme vice is shallowness.\\" Let's no longer be \\"shallow\\" and start buying and paying attention to real art. It's there; it is only tremendously underrated.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is a great show. The mother, Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Lorelai Gilmore AKA Rory live in the town of Stars-Hollow. <br /> <br />Lorelai and Rory are best friends. Lorelai is a very fun character she acts childish at times which makes the show great she also is a single parent. Rory is a great student and has wishes to go to Harvard. <br /> <br />Lorelai is the daughter of Emily and Richard Gilmore. When Lorelai had Rory she had moved out of the house and rarely keeps in touch with them. Now when Rory gets accepted to Chilton a private school she has to turn to her parents for money. Emily and Richard do give her the money to pay for the school on one condition, she and Rory have to go and have dinner with them every Friday. It wouldn't seem so bad if it weren't for the fact that Lorelai's parents drive her insane.  <br /> <br />I haven't seen such a great show in a long time and I highly recommend it to everyone yes even guys I had my brother watch it and he likes it too.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Man am I upset. Debut album was so awesome, Toxicity was good. Their dubut is my favorite album period.  This Mezmerize is such a huge disappointment cause they are much better than this. Old School Hollywood and Violent Pornography are the worst songs I ever heard, made me sick to my stomach. I found 2 songs that are listenable, B.Y.O.B. isn't one of them. I think these guys need some counseling.
B0000CBHOI|1.0|I`am a big blues fan!! I have been since i was 8 yrs old. I was very excited when i first heard there was going to be a seris on the blues. However, I was very dissopointed in it. Martin was all over the place in the first show. He was talking about Africa Music and then started talking about delta music. He did not go in order of how blues was orginated. If they ever do a blues seris again they need Ken Burns to do it.
B0006399FS|5.0|OK, I'm over 40 and I've been around and know what I like in music and I remember U-2 when they were brand new.  This is U-2's best album to date.  It's mature, thoughtful, romantic and a great CD, every song's a winner.  Does it sound like the angry rockin' U-2 from the early days? No. They've grown up now. My favorite's are \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\", \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Yahweh\\" and \\"A Man and A Woman.\\"  Anyone who says they don't like this CD is probably too young to appreciate it or is still hanging on to the old U-2 from the '80's and doesn't want to let go.  Take my advice, if you haven't already bought this, buy it now and do yourself a favor.

Almost every day, for ten years, I read The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig. Today I am ordering four new copies. One for my daughters children, one for my son's son, one for me, and one for a fourteen year old boy to give to his little brothers. I know he will be thrilled to recieve it.
B000001DQG|5.0|Elton John and partner Bernie Taupin made a wise move not following up their masterwork \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" with another ambitious double album, since they would have fallen flat on their face, since nothing they did can compare to \\"GBYBR\\" (with the exception of 1975's \\"Captain Fantastic And The Browndirt Cowboy\\"). Instead, the next album, \\"Caribou\\", was a return to the simpler, more mainstream \\"Caribou\\". Despite getting mixed reviews from critics, the album continued Elton's string of number one albums and yielded two top ten hits.<br /><br />While this album has its share of weak tracks (\\"Stinker\\"), some of Elton's best stuff is on \\"Caribou\\". \\"Pinky\\" is one of Captain Fantastic's finest ballads, with a brilliantly understated vocal and a simple yet spellbinging arrangement. The rollicking \\"Grimsby\\" is a downhome rocker driven by Davey Johnstone's guitar prowess and the strong rhythm section of Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray. I should probably take the time out to mention that this trio is possibly the best group of backing musicians for any artists, and it's a shame the three never collaborated as their own album, which would gave been awesome. Anyway, back to the album. \\"I've Seen The Saucers\\" is a song about UFO sightings. The idea of the song is rather stupid, but the sinister arrangement keeps it aloft. \\"Solar Prestige A Gammon\\" is a good tune but only if you don't take it seriously. \\"You're So Static\\" is a tongue in cheek  denouncement of NYC that is good but the live version on \\"Here And There\\" is much better. \\"Ticking\\" is an absolute masterpiece. I can't really think of any words to describe this song. But when I saw Elton at Madison Square Garden in 1999, he did a haunting version of this song. I was breathless.<br /><br />Then there's the album's two hit singles.\\"The Bitch Is Back\\" is a tongue in cheek rocker that was abnned by many radio stations but still became a massive hit, reaching number four on the Hot 100 and remaining a radio staple. Then, there's \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\". Wow, what to say about this. This may well be the best song Elton ever did, and without a doubt one of the finest pop singles ever released. This is truly a moment of absolute perfection, from its chilling piano intro to its triumphant outtro.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are excellent additions to this already strong album. \\"Pinball Wizard\\" is indeed a cover of the 1969 classic by The Who, and to be honest, (and I know I will be blasted for this over and over), Elton's version is so much better. It is so energetic and fun. \\"Sick City\\" is somewhat of a novelty number but is can be taken seriously and is overall a very good track. \\"Cold Highway\\" is a midtempo tribute to a friend of Elton and Bernie who was killed in a car accident. Closing out this remastered edition of the album is Elton's holiday standard \\"Step Into Christmas\\". It's a Christmas song, but can be enjoyed all year round.<br /><br />Ovverall, \\"Caribou\\" is definitely not as strong as \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", and is definitely worth owning. I say that you shouldn't listen to all the reviews (maybe not even mine) and see for yourself just how good you might find this album.en, there's \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\".

B00000295Y|5.0|An immensely entertaining hip-hop classic.  This CD is never out of my disc changer for very long, as it somehow never seems to get old.  The rhymes are lively and studded with classic lines (a personal favorite: \\"My oven's on high when I roast a quail/Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale\\"), and B-Real's delivery (indeed his voice) is unlike anything you've heard anywhere else.  The backing tracks have an aged, worn, musty feel that somehow perfectly matches the album's cover art; where a lot of hip-hop recordings from the early 90s now seem overproduced and far too reliant on electronic sounds that have not aged well, \\"Black Sunday\\"'s emphasis on sparse textures and samples of old recordings keeps it sounding as fresh as the latest Roots album (and for many of the same reasons).  Best of all, you get one great song after another: everyone remembers \\"Insane in the Brain,\\" but this CD is loaded: \\"Ain't Going Out Like That,\\" \\"When the S*** Goes Down,\\" \\"Hand on the Glock,\\" \\"Hits From the Bong\\"... there's scarcely a weak track on the entire album.  It really is compulsive listening.   <br /> <br />Like all great art, though, \\"Black Sunday\\" leaves a few burning questions unanswered: with all that pot-smoking, shouldn't these guys be mellow instead of gun-crazed?  And why does DJ Muggs sound so very much like Grandpa Simpson?
B00005JNQ8|1.0|Sydney Pollack? N.Kidman and S.Penn? Does such heavy artillery need to be utterly wasted in order to make a remarkably boring film? Questions, questions...And who wrote the excuse for a script for this? Whoever it was he/she needs special mention. One needs talent to write something as low quality as this.       Nitty gritty time. A blond woman (guess who) is being hunted by bad, bad, bad african characters who work for a corrupt, corrupt, corrupt african leader from an imaginary country which according to the script has a major blond and/or white  population but is otherwise in no way connected or influenced/manipulated by the west. This was by the way a touch i seriously loved. Kudos to the scriptwriter again.        A black haired cop (guess who) comes in to save the blond african girl (the tears, the tears). The blond african girl is an interpreter who -we're told speaks \\"Koo\\" but in the process of the film winds up speaking several other languages in a moment's notice. Now, pay attention, the blond african girl overhears some bad Koo-speaking black Africans plotting the assasination of the soon to come to the U.N to give a speech in English bad African leader of Kurduboo (or something like that, the country is fictional) who also speaks Koo. Koo is very trendy in the film.        This sets off the slowest hunt in the history of bad movie making. The bad Koos chase the good Koo and the Brooklyn accented copper almost learns Koo himself in the process cuzz he spends more time doing the Koo thing with the blond african girl than anything else. Oh no, this doesn't mean they get to do the hot thing if you get my drift. But they sure beat it a lot around the Koo bush trying to get there. Confused? Hey, it's not me, that's the film i'm describing here.        A bus explodes, some more Koo gets spoken, Penn and Kidman seem to be undetered in their quest for the slowest advancing romance ever, and the world meets in the U.N to hear some more Koo. You get the picture.I really dont know (not sure i want to either) why actors of such caliber chose to participate in a heavily disguised mediocre comedy such as this. I suspect in horror they thought the script was good. But i dont want to believe it. The film is promoted as a \\"political thriller\\". It's neither political nor does it thrill. It fails even as a comedy. It fails in fact in so many aspects you can easily lose count. But it sure inspires you to write about it.        As a last note i'll say this. The holes in the story were only outmatched in number by the sheer size of them. In a display of pure professionalism the scriptwriter kept the biggest hole for the very last scene where the entire security force of the U.N watches Kidman through a camera hold a gun to the head of someone (plus breach all levels of U.N security in the process) only to walk breasy-easy free afterwards cuzz she was doing the right thing.   Brilliant, simply brilliant.
B0000019PA|5.0|That is all there is to it. See the title for my review. There will never be a singer/songwriter like him again. His lyrics are so emotional and vivid, his singing so raw and heartfelt...there is really nothing more I can say. This is one of the 3 or 4 albums I've ever heard where I cannot really put into words how important and beautiful this record is to me. I just hope if you are reading this review, you have also read the others and can judge for yourself that this is a album to own. I don't know anybody who kind of likes this album. You are either completely devoted and in love with it or you hate it. I also recommend \\"On Avery Island\\", an equally brilliant album that is just as good but hated on by many NMH fans for some odd reason.

What I will say is that I took the idea of quieting the ego/mind and becoming the observer to heart.  I had no idea how much the book had affected me until, literally, about two days after having finished it.  I awoke to discover I had vertigo (no, not from the book!).  As I opened my eyes and attempted to move, the room literally spun like a superfast ferris wheel.  Instead of freaking out, which would have been a normal reaction, I observed myself watching the room spinning.  I literally observed myself and my only thought was \\"Hmmm, the room is spinning. How interesting.\\"  Once I made it to the doctor, bumping into walls along the way and almost falling over repeatedly, the doctor remarked how amazing it was to him that I didn't appear to be distressed over the vertigo. Maybe I should have explained I was the observer and not emotionally attached to what was happening to me but I was afraid they would have scheduled me for brain scans!   <br /> <br />I do wonder how emotionally unattached we should be in general by being the observer but I also see great value in getting our ego/mind to be quiet.  Honestly, we let it chatter on incessantly until it can literally ruin our lives.  Eckhart Tolle's work can help anyone keep their ego/mind in check to improve our quality of life.  Imagine being free of those draining, self-defeating thoughts!   <br /> <br />This book is on my short list of books I really believe can change someone's life.  I highly recommend it.
B000000WF0|5.0|To best understand this album, we must approach it from the times that created it. Circa 1995 The Verve had released the epic \\"Northern Soul\\" album, continuing their evolution from a shoegazing, reverb-drenched, psychedelic freak-out band into a more mature, soulful, inspired, reverb-drenched psychedelic rock band. Sadly, the powerful tension between shaman-esque frontman Richard Ashcroft and guitarist-extraordinaire Nick McCabe (perhaps the most unappreciated British guitarist of the '90s) came to a peak and the band split with the release of \\"History\\" as their farewell single. <br /> <br />After a year of simmering creativity, Richard Ashcroft began writing a solo album and drafting in musicians to help record his efforts. Gradually, the dynamic Verve rhythm section of Peter Salisbury and Simon Jones was brought back into the fold, along with guitarist/keyboard player Simon Tong. After a few months, an acknowledged void was recognized and several guitarists were approached to play lead guitar, including ex-Suede member Bernard Butler. He declined in order to concentrate on his own material instead, and the Verve continued as a four-piece. Eventually, Ashcroft succumbed to reason and extended an olive branch to McCabe to return.  <br /> <br />With several songs in place, the Verve concentrated on the remaining unfinished material in jam sessions, spooling hours of tape and letting their combined efforts birth the songs. This effort was finally released in 1997 as \\"Urban Hymns\\" and the Verve finally took their place as one of Britain's most beloved bands. \\"See the Verve when they come to your town\\" went the saying \\"because you may never get the chance to see them again.\\"  <br /> <br />Too prophetic words, unfortunately, as the tension between Ashcroft and McCabe returned. Towards the end of the year, McCabe announced his exit from the band, and the Verve soldered on for several months with BJ Cole on steel guitar before they called it a day. <br /> <br />So what wehave in this album is an artifact from the days of Noel-Rock, with earnest lyrics, thematic musical canvases of epic scale, and really good tunes. It's also an album of halves with the personal and the universal gaining equal attention. Ashcroft has never differentiated between the two, speaking for both himself and to humanity in the same breath, thus a song as tragic and guarded as \\"Drugs Don't Work\\" shines when embraced by everyone. Same again with \\"Sonnet\\" and the burnished genius of \\"Lucky Man\\" which, tellingly enough, are recognized as the songs Ashcroft was planning for his solo album. Longtime Verve fans will rejoice at the slow burn grooves of \\"Neon Wilderness\\" and \\"Weeping Willow\\". The songs fully completed by the full band are complete barnstormers of edgy, muscular rock with \\"Rolling People\\", \\"Space and Time\\", and the freak-out monster of \\"Come On\\" closing the book of the Verve's time together.  <br /> <br />While Ashcroft would explore similar personal efforts on his proper solo album \\"Alone With Everyone\\", he would never scale the heights of fury that McCabe brought to the table. We should be grateful for what we have to remind us. And we're not going to talk about \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" because a bunch of spoiled, old men who used to be rock stars sued the pants off the Verve and almost ruined them before their comeback began. <br /> <br />An album of true genius and a landmark of British rock at the end of the 20th century.
B00006RCOB|3.0|Now this movie is one of he most ridiculous films about USSR I ever seen. Most russians (like me) could die from laughter while watching that one. The scenes in Soviet Union are simply hilarious. The uniforms look like WW2 British Army, the cars are mostly from the 60's (why the hell KGB agents would drive a black governments Chaika from the 60's?), the metro looks nothing like the truth plus it has a great hotel-style mensroom! I mean we moscovites are proud of our metro but this is too much. USSR looks like some stupid Evil Emprire out of Star Wars with a nice mix of Nazi Germany with KGB men asking for \\"papers\\" each 5 minutes. The funniest thing is Clint  never even cared about the actual russian translation  - bumaga is russian means just paper not documents!  All russian language used in the film (both spoken and written) is so bad that I could not understand a word. I guess real Gant would last 3 minutes with such a language not to mention the whole story of him getting in the plane is so unbelievable that I guess KGB was pretty much insulted by the way they were portrayed in the film! Now don't get me wrong I'm not a communist, but the political reality of the early 80's USSR was ... to say politely VERY different from that Nazi/Stalinist regime in the movie. Imprisoned jewish scientists - gimme a break! From one side it's histericaly funny, from the other - a bit frightening that americans back then really believed in that Evil Empire George Lucasy stereotypes.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Remember people, this is the first half of a double album.  Do not draw conclusions yet.  But with that being said, the first half is AMAZING.  The intro, Soldier Side, really draws you in, and then spits you right back out again with BYOB.  From then on, SOAD takes you on a crazy trip.  This is definitely SOAD's trippiest effort, involving twisting, melodic Eastern sounds, breath-taking harmonies, and yet they still rock just as hard.   <br /> <br />What problems do I have with the record?  Some songs lyrically aren't up to par.  These songs would mainly be Radio/Video and Old School Hollywood.  However, the insane rockability of them more than makes up for it.  Also, like many people have already commented, Daron gets a little too much mic time. I actually like his voice, yet I felt on some songs that either Serj should be singing (Lost in Hollywood) or his vocals should be a bit louder.  Hopefully, we will hear more of Serj on Hypnotize. <br /> <br />This album definitely sounds a lot different than their debut, so I can see why some people would have a problem.  But if SOAD kept releasing albums that sounded like their debut, they would already be boring by now.  Each album has been a bit of a transition, with Steal This Album giving hints of what Mezmerize would sound like.  What will Hypnotize sound like?  Judging by this album, I am going to say INCREDIBLE.
B000935UFS|5.0|I have been listening to NIN for a very long time...the better part of 13 years...Each record is a new journey...current and coinciding with Trent Reznor's life...I think he has shown his growth with this record...and also his ability to bite back harder than he himself was bitten...I like each record for many different reasons...This one because it is raw and real...5 stars!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|In my opinion this is the best I've heard of System of a Down. I also read a few other reviews and would like to correct someone who stated that they fired Serj. This isn't true, in fact the band just announced a summer tour with The Mars Volta which will definately be cool.  <br /> <br />Now back to the album. There are few albums in my collection that I can started from track 1 and leave all the way through. All though Mezmerize is somewhere around 30 minutes, each song changes so often that it seems much longer. I don't mind Daron taking a little more spotlight as he and Serj compliment each other well. I'm very anxious for the next CD Hypnotize this fall, and encourage you all to buy this album and support an original band that you can just about positively say will NEVER sell out.
1932100385|5.0|With all due respect to the fellow who can't give this book a 5 star rating because it was \\"boring,\\" I gotta say I couldn't put it down! I thought it was fascinating and extremely well-written, particulary considering the need to give some explanation and evidence for the research findings presented. <br /> <br />I've been a vegetarian for 25 years, and mostly vegan for about 8 years, but still had the occaisional dairy food, and indulged quite a bit in refined sugars and carbohydrates. Despite my relatively low consumption of animal products, I've been 30 to 50 pounds overweight for years. I love to eat! I love to feel really full. Maybe you're like that, too. Now, I've been following Dr. Campbell's eating recommendations for just a few days and taking him at his word that I can eat as much as I like of whole, plant-based foods. I'm pigging out, and never had better tasting or more fulfilling food. I already feel much better and I do believe I'm losing weight! This book is just so amazing. I recently lost a friend to cancer, and my cousin's wife will be undergoing a mastectomy for breast cancer soon. I so wish we hadn't been lead astray for so long by those who's profit lies in keeping us addicted to animal products, which overwhelming scientific evidence has shown for many years to be disaterously unhealthy for us. I just bough 4 more books to give to friends and family, and I'll continue doing that every month. Give yourself and those you love the gift of this book; eat whole, plant-based food; dramatically improve your health, reduce your chance of illness; and give the animals a break.
0790740443|4.0|You've been handpicked at birth and trained to serve in an elite military unit...indoctrinated from the time that you can walk and talk that the military is your only friend and family..that weakness is death, to only speak when spoken to by your superiors, and that trust is a commodity you cannot afford to possess...in short, to believe that you exist for only one purpose. What happens when after nearly 40 years of \\"following the path\\" you become obsolete, are discarded like trash, and abandoned countless miles from home? In this case, you discover that being more than what you can be goes beyond that well known slogan. Watch Kurt Russell's finely shaded performance in \\"Soldier\\" and see for yourselves...This picture breaks no new ground in the action film genre - there's loads of explosions and gun play (fine with me) and a bit of martial arts/hand to hand action courtesy of Jason Scott Lee (\\"Dragon\\") - & to be perfectly honest the drama that emerges when Russell's Sgt. Todd interacts with the surviving members of a space ship crash who have taken up residence on a planet used to dump refuse (or expendable soldiers) is not really all that dramatic...What makes this film really watchable is that Russell gets the job done in making you realizing what his character is experiencing using only sparse dialogue (roughly 35 words), facial expressions and (to his great surprise)a couple of tears. This picture's worth a look.....RG      <br />
B000000H5J|5.0|I really rejoiced that I've bought this cd from the very beginning, you know, the groove of two bass drums. <br />Then all went BANG! Vocal was growling lovely, guitars were scattering my brains. Some minor parts in their <br />first album was completely fixed. They made a great success in making compact, heavy confessions on modern cruelties. <br /> <br />But, there is one track I still don't understand, it is so a boring track. I guess, they tried to cutoff all the unnecessities <br />from their songs and built into a single song.  <br /> <br />Anyway I keep on skipping that track...Anyway, any how, there's no doubt that this album rules, and it's their best album, <br />and one of the masterpiece in the history of thrash/hardcore page.
B00002E224|1.0|THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE. EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL THAT PEOPlE FOUND ROMANTIC MADE ME FEEL LIKE BARFING! IT WAS FOR SURE THE MOST POINTLESS MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. THE SECOND ONE IS EVEN WORSE! I WATCHED 5 MINUTES OF IT AND HATED IT. THE MAIN ACTRESS IS WAY TO UGLY AND THE ACTING IS BAD! I DON\\"T KNOW WHO WOULD WANT TO WATCH A MOVIE LIKE THIS. A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is one of the most fully realized visions of cinema I have ever witnessed.  Very rarely does a director's intentions fully come through for one reason or another.  Here, Gibson has financed this film himself, hand-picked his cast (mostly unknowns) and put together a coherent and linear script coupled with masterful directing.  And best of all, what you see on the screen is what Mel Gibson saw in his head.  Of course, that can never be known 100%, but, the depth of emotion that this movie goes to, and the rawness of it's power can only mean the the director has gone to incredible extremes to put forth their vision.  Of this Mel Gibson should be commended.  The title of the film is The Passion of the Christ, most commonly referred to as a time consisting of the last twelve hours before Jesus Christ was tortured and crucified.  Anyone looking for the Life of the Christ will not get that in this film.  The title already says what it's about.  The Passion.  Now to the film itself.  First, Jim Caviezel portrays Jesus Christ in the best way possible, spiritually resilient yet completely vulnerable to all the elements of being human.  Totally divine and totally human.  The cinematography is brilliant.  The musical score, while borrowing from the Last Temptation of Christ (supposedly) is just good enough that it supports everything we see but doesn't overdo it.  The choice of having the dialogue in Latin and Aramaic is inspired.  It lends itself to the authenticity of the film.  This leads into the violence of the film.  Well, I wouldn't call it violence, I would call it torture.  Violence is armies lining up on a battlefield or a gunfight followed by a car chase.  The Passion contains a lot of torture and blood.  The question of whether such a brutal portrayal of the torture was necessary, I would be inclined to answer yes, if Mel Gibson's intention was to be as authentic as possible (which it was).  A Roman scourging/flogging brutal and ugly and angry.  Anyone's body would be fileted after such an event, as was Jesus Christ's.  The crucifixion itself is also honestly brutal and ugly as well, and Mel Gibson does not blanket that.  So, what can be said overall?  I don't care to debate the religious context of the film.  It's a work of art, and it should be judged in that arena.  As a film/work of art, The Passion of the Christ succeeds where many other films fail.  It is a fully realized vision of a passionate director.  And for that alone, this film deserves a full five star rating.
B000062YAZ|1.0|This \\"music\\" is horrendus. <br /> <br />I can't belive all of the retards out there that actually think this is good, you must have a IQ of about 20 to enjoy Slayer or even remotly take them seriously as musicians. They were almost like the Slipknot of their day, making loud, sloppy, random diareah of the mouth noise and passing it off as music, while trying to come off as scary and satanic to shock people. OK, i bet these guys don't even know the first thing about satanism, and the fact that they wrote a song about the holocaust proves that they have their heads up their @$$es, who would seriously write a song about such a horrible, REAL event? The whole CD is only about 28 minutes in long, and you pay about 18 bucks for this thing, can you say RIPOFF? <br /> <br />I like heavy metal, but i don't like these guys. They are an insult to the integrity of the gendre. No wonder heavy metal has recived a bad reputation from the public, its c r a p like this that ruins it for everybody. Judas Preist got sued in 1986 for a song that they didn't even write, yet these retards wrote songs that promoted mass murder, nazis, killing, satan, and nothing happens to them, can you smell irony? <br /> <br />These guys don't deserve a red cent from anybody, put your money elsewhere to a band with integrity. Any 80's Metallica or Megadeth album will do, get some of those. These guys deserve to burn, screwing people out of hard earned cash with this rancid puke.
B0007Y08I8|3.0|It was a film.  Yes, the puppets were original, but it pretty much contained the same worn-out and at times over-hyped humour other \\"satires\\" use. <br /> <br />Some things in the film were funny.  The characters are all parodies of major action film stereotypes:  the jock leader, the hardheaded brawler, the sensitive agent, the smart-and-pretty agent, and the oddball one who has 50 zillion other skills the rest of the team needs. It worked.   <br /> <br />Trey and Matt aren't afraid to take chances.  Cool.  They're also equal opportunity offenders.  No political group is safe; Team America represents the current cowboy administration while the Film Actors Guild represents the peacenicks.  Race, nationality, sexual orientation... nothing is safe from humour. <br /> <br />But aside from the fact everything was done with puppets, there just isn't anything that separates this film from the other satirical action films out there.  I just wasn't impressed, don't see what all the hype is about.  Satire with puppets.  Wow. <br /> <br />Yeah, I'm giving it three stars.  Smart, edgy, and creative.  But not so much that it stands out as something worthy of five stars.  Oh, and some of the toilet humour is just old.  If you're thirty-three and still find some of the scat and vomit jokes funny, you need to grow up.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin had a tough act to follow after the release of their fourth album in November 1971.'Houses of the Holy' had some pretty big shoes to fill when it finally emerged in the early spring of '73. Expansion of sound vs. lack of blues could have been many a listener's first impression and what can you say about \\"The Crunge\\"? Classic album? For sure and it fits very snugly into Zep's glory run of LPs one through six, but for me it is my least favorite of the six. Why? Maybe because \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" has got to be my most hated Zeppelin track of all, at least of the big hits. Reggae is great, but doo-wop reggae? Please! Give me \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", \\"No Quarter\\", \\"The Rain Song\\" and \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" the latter probably being the album's standout track. \\"The Ocean\\" is a killer rocker with the so quiet you might miss it intro from Bonzo, Zep's tribute to the masses that they saw from the stage every night. \\"Dancing Days\\" and \\"Rain Song\\" kind of solidfy the theme of the album for me - the hedonistic celebration of spring/summer weather whereas \\"No Quarter\\" says winter is coming in all its dooming insistence. Complete with the pagan imagery of naked children scrambling to worship an idol(Zeppelin perhaps?)on the cover, \\"HOTH\\", the first titled Led Zeppelin album, was promoted with a legendary tour,documented of course in the film \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" and from then on Zeppelin ruled the '70's. Man, but that crappy reggae song bugs me......
B000929AJQ|5.0|I'm not one of those people who can say they were listening to Nine Inch Nails before everybody else, but I am a longtime listener. One of the first bands I discovered while in high school, NIN also counts as one of the first I gave money. While the posuers and party people hooked onto \\"Closer\\" my sophomore year, I first discovered an earlier effort called *Pretty Hate Machine*.<br /><br />Now founder and front man Trent Reznor brings an LP some believe harkens back to that seminal album. Yes, *With Teeth* stays true to established Nails themes and elements. Yet it evolves both musically and socially from the very sub-genre he helped create. Overall, *With Teeth*  is a fine addition to the NIN discography, though also quirky and different enough to put everybody off.<br /><br />-1989 Inch Nails--<br /><br />People seem to have trouble fingering this album. There's a lot a blanket comparisons to past works. That's understandable precisely because it isn't that simple. For example, people say track 2 sounds like something from *Broken*. But \\"You Know What You Are?\\" features chords, beats, tones, and lyrics almost alien to the 1992 EP. The track sounds more mature and expensive than probably the entire, earlier album. The only similarity lies in the sheer vocal aggression.<br /><br />Even more inaccurate and complicated are the comparisons to *The Downward Spiral's* \\"Hurt\\" and *With Teeth's* \\"Right Where it Belongs\\". Yes, both haunting pieces end their respective albums with a whimper instead of a bang-a NIN trademark. The former focuses on the dramatic ruin of a man.  It's a self-pitying tragedy. The newer track, aside from being a more complex piece of music, portrays a man fighting to live and to assert his identity in a mass media world. It almost contradicts \\"Hurt\\" to say \\"Hey, don't take this all so seriously! I'm just a rock star. Hear that audience cheering towards the end of the song? That's my idea of making fun of me and my fans alike!\\"<br /><br />Indeed, a lot of *With Teeth* sounds like an effort to break away from the mold he cast himself in his first three albums. \\"Only\\" draws PHM comparisons because of it's overtly 80's style beat, combined with lyrics bearing a superficial resemblance to \\"Down in it\\". But it doesn't seem to occur to people that this might be satire-even sarcasm. \\"Only\\", like \\"RWIB\\", seems to reflect a tongue-in-cheek reference to his entire reputation, in addition to his first album.<br /><br />-Breaking the Fragile-<br /><br />Standing 16 years from *PHM*, his latest album seems to draw from its immediate predecessor. Reznor's 1999 double-CD *The Fragile* remains among my favorite music albums of all time, in part because it demonstrated a musical depth and complexity far beyond anything attempted in not only in Reznor's earlier efforts, but that of many other artists.<br /><br />But Reznor, like many other meaningful artists who hit it big around 1994, made the mistake of waiting too long. It wasn't just a matter of the \\"Closer\\" poseurs leaving the show in the face of Reznor's improved musicianship. In his five-year absence, Britney Spears and Limp Bizkit stole the spotlight. The wings filled up with rap-rockers, piano girls, and strip-tease pop stars. In the `99 music environment, *The Fragile* went straight to the head of the stage--only to be pushed into the orchestra pit.<br /><br />-Somewhat Repaired-<br /><br />*With Teeth* sounds like a lessoned learned, being the most dance, single, and radio-friendly material he's made in my ears. It drops the instrumentals, and a lot of instruments, and cranks up the bass over guitars and drums. The first half rocks with catchy anthems and raps. Supposedly geared towards a more live or organic performance, the album sounds heavily synthesized to me, and frequently reminds me of David Bowie-reasons why people might compare it to *PHM*.<br /><br />Yet a lot of *Fragile* and *Still* mechanics exist here. Reznor pulls off a coup in retaining the complexity and depth of music while making it utterly stripped and digestible. And like its predecessor, many of the tracks abandon lyrics at some point to embark on lengthy and fascinating solos. The lyrics themselves tend towards *Fragile*  structure than those of prior albums. *With Teeth* also marks the second album in a row in which the song titles are as lengthy and involved as the music. Finally, it builds off the *Fragile* graphic design, employing a minimalist album art consisting of fuzzy close ups and maimed logos, as well as abandoning the distinctive font used in most of the NIN catalogue.<br /><br />Structurally, the album inverses *Fragile*, having a rocking first half and a more critical second. It also resembles *PHM* in being an anthology of songs. Yet it's extremely cohesive-one of the most cohesive pieces Reznor has assembled. I think it's as conceptual an album as anything Reznor's done. As the album progresses the tracks increasingly and dramatically segue, and plunge into increasingly challenging and interconnected layers. So too are the ideas in the songs.<br /><br />Overall *With Teeth* has at lot more depth and individuality than it may first appear to have, both beneath the public appeal and among NIN's prior albums. I can listen to \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" constantly though it's not something to tap my feet to as I'm driving to work. This is the sort of thing I look for in music.<br /><br />-And All that Could Have Spent-<br /><br />Which leads me to the album tray and cover. The layout compares to *PHM*: both albums are the only albums to feature Reznor's picture. Both also invoke computerized distortion in the album art. Then it departs for the first time from the practice of including lyrics and album information. The cover looks and feels like the same sort of thin cardstock used with *And All that Could Have Been* Deluxe, only with out the heavy cardboard slipcase. On the other hand, I paid less for *With Teeth* dual-disc edition than that of esoteric and anti-establishment CD's like King Missile's *Royal Lunch*.<br /><br />In the end, *With Teeth* seems to gain good reviews, but it's more of a challenge than people credit. No mere throwback, NIN critics probably won't be converted by its satires and self-references, while those who take the past drama too seriously may be disappointed by the very same. None of this wears the album for the worse.

B0007XT87G|5.0|As great as In Absentia was, Deadwing builds upon it to deliver an album of stunning songwriting, deft instrumentation, terrific lyrical imagery, and the perfect balance between heavy & light and chiaroscuro & full-blown technicolor. This album establishes Steven Wilson as one of the truly great modern intelligent rock songcrafters, and as worthy a successor to the likes of Kevin Gilbert as we've had in quite some time. Check out the amazing lead breaks by Adrian Belew---his guitar fits this music like a glove; he'd be a great full-time addition to PT. <br /> <br />The self titled opening track has got to be one of the all-time great album openers, a galloping mini-epic featuring rip-your-face-off guitar riffery, slow, atmospheric sections, an amazing Belew lead break, beautiful keyboard orchestrations and vocal melodies and harmonies--a microcosm of what PT is all about  wrapped up in one song. <br /> <br />There are still touches of prog rock and Pink Floydian psychedelia in spots. The music sounds very modern and up-to-date, though, and many of these tracks could easily get heavy radio airplay. PT has become the band Radiohead could have been after OK Computer had they not chosen to take a bizarre turn into the incoherent messes they've released since. <br /> <br />Without a doubt one of the truly classic rock records to be released in this decade.
B0002IU988|5.0|What a solid album. I cant believe some guys here are complaining. This is not creed, let it go. This album ROCKS. The new guy can sing... the melodies are awesome. I just want to crank it up to 11 and rock out.  <br /> <br />ROCK OUT!!!
B000000WA4|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time in my opinion, #1 with a bullet.         It is rare that an album can so thoroughly define an era, but this one does, it brings visual and sonic memories of 1996, a shaved headed Billy Corgan in their amazing music videos from this album was seemingly on MTV 24/7 that year, hearing \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" and \\"1979\\" and \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" every time you turned on a radio in 96, the awards, both Grammys and them dominating the MTV Video Awards.     This is timeless, it sounds as good today as it did 11 years ago and some of the songs I didn't care so much for back then are now growing on me all this time later, while the songs I loved back then are still favorites of mine, they never get old.    This was a ONE OF A KIND piece of art, the greatest I have ever come across in my 38 years on this earth.        There were some amazing albums in the 90s....Tori Amos \\"Boys for Pele\\" and \\"Little Earthquakes\\", of course \\"Siamese Dream\\" and both \\"The Bends\\" and the amazing \\"OK Computer\\" from Radiohead to name a few, but \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" was and always will be in a league of it's own.    I won't even bother going through the songs, there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been said already, except to say that \\"1979\\" and \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" are 2 of the best songs of all time, but the power of \\"Mellon Collie\\" lies in the endless array of gems that were not hits....\\"Cupid DeLocke\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"To Forgive\\", \\"Muzzle\\", \\"Galapagos\\", \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\", the amazingly beautiful title track, \\"Here is No Why\\", etc.etc., the list goes on and on.    If you are trying to make up your mind whether or not to purchase this album, let me make your mind up for you....STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND BUY IT IMMEDIATELY !!    I don't want to sound corny, but it will change your life and become a soundtrack for all of the various moods.....happy, sad, pensive, summer, winter, young, old, whatever.    This is the apexof modern music.    FIFTY STARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00007LTIC|3.0|Disclaimer: I am not giving this a mediocre review because I hate all prog rock. I am a large Yes fan who owns approximately six of their albums and I consider \\"Close To The Edge\\" to be my favourite album. <br /> <br />The Review: Of the album's five tracks, I enjoy two of them - the opener \\"Going For The One\\" and the closer \\"Awaken\\". I gave the album three stars because of the three songs in between.  <br /> <br />I find these songs to be a bit meandering and lacking memorable melody or structure. They seem to just waddle around for several minutes and then end, with no lasting impression made. One of the things that makes Yes so great is their compositional form and structure - evident in great songs like Close To The Edge, South Side of the Sky, or Gates of Delirium. The songs on Going For The One generally lack this quality, and they also sound a bit dated to my ears. I just can't get into this album the way that I can enjoy many of their other great albums. This is definitely not the album to start with if you're new to Yes - I'd recommend starting with The Yes Album or Fragile, then Close To The Edge. <br /> <br />Overall, I think that this is a highly overrated, mediocre release by a generally great band. Get this after you get Fragile, Yes Album, Close to the Edge, Relayer, and Tales. <br /> <br />Note: As with most albums that have either a 4.5 or 5 average rating on this site, I expect this review to receive a large number of \\"not helpful\\" votes solely because I am not giving it a glowing review. This is stupid.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I admit, I never bought or heard \\"Gish\\".    I, like many out there in the early 90's, started my Pumpkins experience with this album and 12 years later, it is still one of the best investments I've ever made.    I absolutely ADORE (pardon the pun) their follow up \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\", I think it is the crowning achievement of not only the Pumpkins, but 90's rock music.    But all these years later, I am gaining further pleasure from \\"Siamese Dream\\" than I did even when it came out, and that's saying something because I LOVED it from day 1.    I find myself going back to my 90's music collection because of how horrible \\"rock\\" music has been throughout this decade, with very few exceptions (System of a Down, White Stripes and a handful of others).    I always liked \\"Today\\" basically from the first time I heard it back in the early 90's, and I thought \\"Disarm\\" was a masterpiece the level  of which I never heard before in the world of rock music.    But I am even more into songs like \\"Mayonnaise\\" and \\"Soma\\" now then I was then upon re-listening to this cd lately.    \\"Mayonnaise\\" is a tremendous song and in my opinion, the best on the cd, which is really saying something considering that I love basically every song on this masterpiece.    I am a HUGE Pumpkins fan and can't wait for Billy's solo album to come out next month.    This album IS everything it was cracked up to be, for people looking to get into the Samshing Pumpkins, buy this first, then their best and THE best rock album of the 90's \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\\".    You will not be disappointed AT ALL.    The Smashing Pumpkins were the best band of the 90's hands down and maybe the best American Rock Band EVER !!    Genius and pure bliss...that is their sound.    Billy Corgan is one of the true geniuses in rock history and this brilliant piece of work was his first real opportunity to share it with us, don't miss out on it.    You will thank me later !!!    This album is priceless, a true classic, eclipsed in 90's rock only by their own follow up \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" in the history of alt rock and rock in general.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with Opeth's past, especially their \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" album or even 2002's \\"Deliverance,\\" should know that Opeth is primarily a metal band. That is on of the reasons why this album, \\"Damnation,\\" is such a shock. The other reason is, even if Opeth weren't a death metal band, this album is absolutely breathtaking. The power chords, the yelling, the heavy drumming, the sudden, dramatic shifts and breakdowns...they're all gone. Instead, we get a much gentler and kinder side of Opeth, one which is just as talented and creative, but with (mostly) light acoustic strumming, cleanly sung vocals, percussion that is at just the right volume, an occasional piano, and very laid back tempos.<br /><br />What makes this album even more of a surprise is that these eight songs were leftovers from the aforementioned \\"Deliverance\\" album. When fans heard of \\"leftover\\" songs, many were afraid that \\"Damnation\\" would turn out like Metallica's \\"Reload.\\" This comparison couldn't be further from the truth. \\"Damnation\\" and \\"Deliverance\\" are two completely different albums, and (if you ask me) \\"Damnation\\" is better.<br /><br />It's sort of hard for the listener to remember specific songs, since (unlike previous Opeth albums) \\"Damnation\\" is all one mood, and the melody weaves together most of the beginnings and ends of songs. But, these songs aren't all the same. If you listen carefully, you'll realize each of these songs have specific, distinguishing qualities and each one is pretty in its own way.<br /><br />\\"Windowpane\\" is a good representation of the whole album. It has a very mellow and relaxed vibe and tempo, with vocals that wouldn't be out of place on a country music album. It also includes an instrumental middle, soft but catchy drum work (which includes plenty of symbols), and dwindling, light as a feather guitar work.<br />\\"In My Time of Need\\" begins with soft, muted staccato vocals, which later become uplifting. The guitarists again strum lightly (which sometimes results in the guitars sounding like a piano-as is common in this album), and the drumming gains speed near the end.<br />\\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\" has more cleanly sung vocals, but here they are extended and makes Mikael Akerfeldt soar above the rest of the group.<br />\\"Closure\\" has a slight temp change, then the song builds and builds to a climax...that doesn't happen. Where you'd think there would be a climax, there is actually a soft breakdown. After this point, the song starts over again. The guitarists' playing gains momentum and becomes increasingly fast, but the song ends before there is another climax.<br />\\"Hope Leaves\\" has distant, pushed-to-the back, and almost spacey vocals. The vocals then come to the foreground when the drums begin, and the song ends by fading out with what sounds like a female choir singing.<br />\\"To Rid the Disease\\" has a mini-guitar solo near the front. A piano (this is the real thing, now) enters the mix, then leaves, then shows up again during the instrumental mid-section. The beeping guitar on this song is lower than usual (low enough that it could pass as a bass guitar.)<br />\\"Ending Credits\\" is an outstanding instrumental. It begins by fading in the instruments, and, when the instruments are fully audible, the listener realizes the drumming is sort of jazzy. Shortly after the song is fully faded in, however, a guitar solo begins and carries throughout the song. Meanwhile, the other guitarist is playing light, background music. This song could pass as a melancholy Sublime song.<br />\\"Weakness\\" has percussion which sound almost aquatic and vocals that are very dreary, thus making this song have a very dreamy feel to it.<br /><br />So, there you have it. This is the prettiest and most atmospheric album of the year (2003). Unlike Godsmack's 2004 acoustic EP, \\"The Other Side,\\" \\"Damnation\\" is more than just an alternative rock album (thus it is better than that album.) This C.D. is one that everyone can enjoy (not only Opeth or metal fans). It's great to listen to when you're just chilling, relaxing, at a funeral, or when you're stoned. The only drawback is you probably need to be well rested before listening to this album, because it's also a great album to fall asleep to. Also, as aforementioned, this whole album has just one theme, and that theme is very soothing, so this is the only Opeth album you should listen to AFTER (and not before) a wrestling match.t chilling, relaxing, at a funeral, or when you're stoned.

B000059RL3|5.0|I was really surprised when I saw the deluxe edition of Marvin Gaye's 1971 magnum opus, \\"What's Going On\\". I asked myself, \\"How many times has this classic been remastered?\\" \\"Isn't this the 4th or 5th time it has been reissued?\\" After buying this and listening to the whole set, I have to say this is the definitive version of \\"What's Going On\\". This edition is split up in six different sections, with the first being the original album, which was released on May 21, 1971. The title track, \\"What's Going On\\", is probably one of Marvin's most widely-recognized song. This song creates complex, jazz elements with soulful harmonies and soft strings. Marvin uses social conscious lyrics to create a poignant, yet personal classic about our world. \\"What's Happening Brother\\" has Marvin talking about his brother coming out of the war and how and what he is doing. \\"Flyin' High In The Friendly Sky\\" has Marvin talking about the dangers of drugs. \\"Save The Children\\" is a sad, powerful, and deep song with Gaye using descriptive lyrics on how we are making a negative world for our children. \\"God Is Love\\" is where Gaye gets on his spiritual side, and lets the world know that God is his true friend and how we need more love in the world. \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\" is the perfect example of an artist tackling the negatives of our environment. Marvin touches on nearly everything our environment lacks. \\"Right On\\" is an adventurous, musical journey with a deep latin feel in the song. Gaye discusses social issues such as poverty. \\"Wholy Holy\\" has Gaye using a more religious approach to cover an aspect on hate. \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\" is the song that just sends chills up my spine. Marvin talks about both the personal and social issues people are going through in America. It is a spare, yet amazing piece of work that closes this brilliant song cycle of a man struggling in America with both personal and social issues of a nation, a revolution, and a state.The second section, which is the \\"Detroit Mix\\" of the whole original album, is really a treat because it gives you a first glance of how this album was going to sound without some of the special overdubbing and multitracking effects that was done on the album you're familiar with. This mix is different because the bass is richer and the production is more raw. The third and final section of disc one is called, \\"The Foundation\\", which is a simple rhythm and strings instrumental mix of the title track, \\"What's Going On\\". The fourth section opens disc 2 with a 12-track live concert that took place at Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center. What is special about this section of this disc is that it showcases Marvin doing a live concert for the first time in four years since his beloved friend, Tammi Terrell died in his arms on stage. It also showcases his stagefright since those four years passed. Over the course of the concert, he sings not only all of the songs from the \\"What's Going On\\" album, he does a memorable medley of some of his 60's hits with Tammi Terrell. Marvin and his backing band sounds unfocused here, but they seem to put on a good show. The fifth section, are single versions of the songs, \\"What's Going On\\", \\"God Is Love\\", and \\"Sad Tomorrows\\", which is a different version of \\"Flyin' High In The Friendly Sky\\". All of the songs on this section are very differnt from the ones you heard on the original album. The final section called, \\"In The Meantime...\\", is a song that is the earlier version of his 1972 hit, \\"Distant Lover\\". The lyrics are completely different from that song. It is crucial because it shows his transition from being a social political artist to a timeless balladeer. Overall, this edition of \\"What's Going On\\" is certain a set you will treasure forever because it is a revolutionary and timeless soul classic that is made better. This lavish, detailed package comes with a 28-page booklet with insightful essays from Smokey Robinson and Ben Edmonds, rare and unseen pictures, and detailed recording information. The remastering that has been done to this set is top-notch and this is probably the best packaging I've ever seen done to a reissue. This is definitely a package every fan or listener of music should have, even if you're not a soul music fan. It is a historical album that is worth every dollar and worth every bit of your time becuase it is not only one of the greatest soul albums of all-time, but it is certainly one of the greatest albums of all-time. A+
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|System of a Down is very (what's the word I'm looking for, here?)... weird. System of a Down is very weird. This quirky C.D. only serves to prove my theory even more. On \\"Mezmerize,\\" they add elements of eccentric metal with melody and add a fistful of humor. The end result is a very energetic and original album (one with a personality and sound all its own) that is full of twists and sounds something like Rage Against the Machine meets early Anthrax meets Weird Al Yankovich.<br /><br />With their brilliant sophomore album, 2001's \\"Toxicity,\\" System proved they were capable of being sincere if they wanted to be. That album had the perfect balance of humor and seriousness; but on this album, they sometimes come across as a bit funny, even if they're trying to be serious (as in \\"Soldier Side.\\") I believe System of a Down add humor to their music so they don't \\"beat the listener over the head\\" with their political beliefs, and maybe even help make politics fun. But this humor, alongside a pile of weird and seemingly irrelevant lyrics (like \\"My c*ck is much bigger than yours!\\"), makes the band's meaningful and often political message get lost (or hard to find, at least).<br /><br />Musically, this album is like a continuation and combination of 2002's \\"Steal this Album\\" and \\"Toxicity.\\" Most of these songs (i.e. \\"Question!\\") are very trippy. They begin with a guitar intro, which is then followed by several crushing and unusual mood and tempo changes. Daron's guitar playing is decent, and there are a handful of good riffs here. But, as often as not, he is not really riffing-only banging on the downtuned power chords. Serj summons his soulful voice on some of these tracks (i.e. \\"Soldier Side,\\" \\"Revenga,\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\") but he doesn't do as good of job at it as he did on \\"Toxicity.\\" Daron also makes more of a vocal appearance on this C.D. than he usually does, and his voice spices up the music a bit more. But, his high-pitched squeals are also a big reason why this C.D. is so odd-sounding. His voice can be decent at times (as in \\"Revenga\\"), but Serj is clearly the better vocalist.<br /><br />\\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is the lead single, so it made its way onto radio long before this album was released. I flipped a lid when I first heard this song, and, when I found out it was System of a Down, I thought for sure it was a belated April Fools Day prank. \\"BYOB\\" is very energetic, bouncy, and off the wall (so I guess you could say it's a good representation of the album as a whole.) Daron Malankian (the guitarist and second vocalist) begins the song with a wall of distorted guitar crunch, then he yelps (in a very high-pitched voice) \\"Why do they always send the poor?\\" The guitars then start bobbing most of the time, and Serj (Tankian-the lead vocalist) sings \\"La la la la la la la.\\" But this song has a strong political message/theme that should not be ignored, and good lyrics like \\"Why don't presidents fight the war/Why do they always send the poor?\\"<br /><br />\\"Revenga\\" has fast galloping guitars and drums with several of the aforementioned beat changes (which make this song slower). Daron takes over the mic and sings, almost a capella, around the two and a half minute mark. This part of the song (which echoes the previous SOAD song \\"Needles\\") shows Daron's voice at a more gentle and subdued level.<br /><br />\\"Cigaro\\" begins with big and crunchy punk/metal riffs (which is similar to-but faster than-the beginning of \\"Deer Dance\\"). Then Daron belts out \\"My c*ck is much bigger than yours!\\" He and Serj then trade off vocal parts, (with Daron singing in a high-pitch and Serj singing in a deep voice) and relay lines like \\"My c*ck can walk right through the door\\" and \\"Can't you see I love my c*ck?\\" Oh...I think we see that, buddy.<br /><br />\\"Violent Pornography\\" is a highlight, but mainly because of the lyrics. It begins with Serj spouting a tongue twister: \\"Everybody, everybody, everybody livin' now/everybody, everybody, everybody sucks.\\" This songthen proceeds to describe how pornography (and television in general) is brainwashing the American people.<br /><br />\\"Question!\\" begins with acoustic strings, then a whiplash tempo change hits and a thunderous, crushing guitar assault which almost makes a \\"booming\\" sound in places. The guitar plays heavily through most of the rest of this song, even over the jazzy beats.<br /><br />The first minute of \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" is light, dwindling strings (without any other instrument). Serj comes aboard and tries to sing soulfully, but his voice ends up sounding nasal. The guitar and drum playing are both rather simple, but (together with the nasal singing) they make one of the album's only fully serious, poignant, and atmospheric tracks.<br /><br />So, it may be a lack of fully solemn tracks, or it may be that I am just spoiled by how good \\"Toxicity\\" was. Or, maybe the members of System of a Down just spent a lot of the time high, while making this C.D. Whatever the case, \\"Mezmerize\\" is a good album, and every one of the songs on here is catchy and make for a good listen, but I just can't find it fully up to par with \\"Toxicity.\\"<br /><br />Part of the problem may be that, since these songs are so quirky, light-hearted and funny, \\"Mezmerize\\" ultimately lacks the depth that \\"Toxicity\\" had. Another problem is that \\"Mezmerize\\" is pretty short. At only 38 minutes long, it makes the listener glad that this album is only a portion of the new material that the band is going to releasing this year. (In case you haven't heard, \\"Mezmerize\\" is only the first C.D. in a double-disc affair. The second C.D., \\"Hypnotize,\\" will surface sometime before year's end.) When \\"Mezmerize\\" stands by itself (without the second C.D.) it seems like a piece of a puzzle...a puzzle that won't be complete for another six months or so.<br /><br />Maybe (hopefully) \\"Mezmerize\\" is the funny, prankster's half of the double C.D. And hopefully \\"Hypnotize\\" will be somewhat more serious and meaningful. But that's not to say that these songs aren't memorable, since there are still a lot of thought provoking lyrics at the root of most of these songs.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Mezmerize\\" lands at about the same musical and maturity level as System of a Down's self-titled debut. If you were a fan of this band before, there's really no reason to stop now; but if you never liked them, this (unfortunately) won't change your mind. If you're new to SOAD, I think you will enjoy this album more if you listen to it first, then go and check out \\"Toxicity.\\"en proceeds to describe how pornography (and television in general) is brainwashing the American people.  <br />\\"Question!\\" begins with acoustic strings, then a whiplash tempo change hits and a thunderous, crushing guitar assault which almost makes a \\"booming\\" sound in places.

B0007Z4S4C|1.0|Like many other older singers, Robert Plant's voice is a lot lower than it used to be.  But unlike Elton John, who writes new material to suit his deeper voice, Plant continues recording tunes he has to whisper to sing in key.  Robert used his real voice in the Honeydrippers, why can't he now?<br /><br />This is particularly irritating in the light of Mr. Plant's repeated assertions that his music be forward looking. Since Manic Nirvana, Plant has been heavily re-exploring themes he developed with Jimmy Page in Zeppelin, and this CD is no different.<br /><br />That's what makes records like this so fustrating for long-time fans - make a record Jimmy Page could make solid contributions to, but force a basement style approach on Jimmy when you actually work with him (Clarksdale)!  Thanks Robert!<br /><br />Somehow, I get the feeling that if Jimmy Page died tomorrow, Plant would start rewriting his role in Zeppelin in the same way McCartney has done with the Beatles: \\"it was all about me.\\"
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Veronica Mars is a brilliantly written, tightly paced show with dark, intricate storytelling and lots of humor. It gets a lot of comparisons to Buffy because its lead character is a tiny blonde teen who takes no prisoners and is always quick with a clever comeback, but in many ways VM is a more complex and intriguing show, and there are almost no \\"fight scenes\\" and no fantasy elements. Unlike Buffy, Veronica has no superpowers and knows she can't \\"kick butt\\" when she is trying to bring down the bad guys. She has only her intelligence and her wits to keep her ahead of the game. Plus, when the going gets rough, she has her trusty dog Backup to scare off the evildoers. <br /> <br />Veronica is frequently described as a \\"modern day Nancy Drew,\\" but she is also much more than that. Yes, she does work for her private investigator dad tracking down missing persons and solving other mysteries both large and small, and her weapons of choice are modern-day tools like the internet, cell phones, and Lojack. But Veronica is not your typical peppy teenage girl. She is the anti-cheerleader, a very angry girl who is more likely to taunt her classmates with clever insults than to provide any cheer. While she does have her softer side, it's well hidden and she doesn't reveal it very often. She didn't always used to be this way, and the series takes it time exploring, via flashbacks, how Veronica used to be in the past and why she became so angry and isolated from her peers. <br /> <br />If you have wanted to watch the show but have been put off by the \\"teen\\" angle, rest assured that there truly is something for everyone here, of any age. The writing is sophisticated and adult. These teens do things like quote Hamlet and make pop-culture references as widely varied as Heathers to Brigadoon, so the dialogue is frequently quippy and never boring. But the humor never takes over the entire show to make it too light, and the tone is pretty dark overall, considering that the underlying mystery driving Veronica for the entire season is finding the person who murdered her best friend Lilly Kane. Add to that some story lines involving rape, incest, and child abuse, and it's clear that this is no comedy. It's also not for children and sometimes tests the bounds of what you might see on network television in terms of the darkness of the subject matter. Drugs, alcohol, and sex are portrayed as a fact of life among teenagers and the show is not moralizing or preachy in any way, although it frequently portrays the sometimes tragic consequences of all of the above. <br /> <br />Kristen Bell is astonishingly good as Veronica, but the entire cast is for the most part pretty first-rate, especially Enrico Colantoni (as her dad Keith Mars) and Jason Dohring (as her arch-nemesis Logan Echolls). If you are a fan of twisty ongoing mysteries like Lost or Twin Peaks, or you enjoy the quippy humor of the Gilmore Girls or the O.C., or even if you like old-fashioned detective stories like Columbo or the Rockford Files, give Veronica Mars a try because it truly combines the best of all of the above. And if you are a guy, Kristen Bell is pretty darn cute, to boot. So there's that, too.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|the story of two men who wake up in a room chained with no means of escape.  the plot thickens as the movie progresses and the back story introduces us to the \\"jigsaw killer\\" who finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.  i put this move on par with se7en.  it is a sick twisted and wonderful trip.  the end had my head spinning.  truly an awesome piece of cinema.  i disagree with some of my other reviews, especially amazon's but this is all my opinion.  i think screenwriter Leigh Whannel (who plays adam, one of the trapped men) does a amazing job especially at the end.  Cary Elwes also chimes in a great performance especially at the end.  Danny Glover adds to the cast as a cop pursuing the killer.  the cast is amazing and supports the story well and director James Wan has written a great psycodrama of a movie.   <br />   i would also like to address the reviewer Rosa La Luna who said that the movie Cube was \\"far superior\\".  Cube was a great move but comparing these two movies is like comparing apples and oranges.  Cube was not scary at all, and i doubt it wa smeant to be.  there was not one moment was i scared, curious how it ends but never was i scared like i was in Saw.  Saw is brutal, thought provoking, and one of the most disturbing films i have ever seen.  Cube was entertaining at best.  i was shocked to see so many bad reviews of this movie.  i loved it so mich i bought it.  i guess everyone is entitled to their opinion.   <br />   as for the dvd there are some cool features/behind the scenes but it is short.  they could have done better there
B000000H57|5.0|Imagine walking through the woods on a cold autumn day.  The sky is grey, the ground is draped in orange and gold leaves, and the mist covers everything, creating an eerie stillness and quiet.  To some people, it seems miserable - to others, it's beautiful.  For the people that appreciate those types of days, \\"October Rust\\" could cut through the silence perfectly.<br /><br />While songs such as \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" or a cover of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" have a definite upbeat, tongue-in-cheek feel to them, the majority of the songs have a \\"haunting\\" sound, with Peter Steele's resonant voice nicely complimented by distorted guitars, organs, and pounding drums.<br /><br />Where most love songs talk about the bright, shiny aspects of falling in love, lead singer Peter Steele nearly laments over it, but never regrets it.  The songs \\"Haunted,\\" and \\"Wolfmoon\\" both have the same type of feel to them, telling of love so strong that it nearly consumes those involved.  But by far, the best song on this album is \\"Love You to Death.\\"  For anyone who has worshipped and adored someone so completely, only to know that you'll never have that feeling returned - this song will tear your still-beating heart out and set it on fire in front of you...and you'll love it.
B0002X314C|4.0|Thank you!  For an R&B artist with talent, writing chops, and a sense of humor.  John Legend is a pleasure to listen to.  A new artist who is an ARTIST.  Ordinary People tugs at the heart strings...  Used 2 Love U -- amazing.  His voice soars and flies with wings for days.  No gimmicks.  There are cameos from famous friends.  Both Snoop and Kanye West add to the playful spirit that pervades the first part of the album. Things slow down and get serious toward the end.  This is the story of a man growing into maturity personally and sharing his heart-tales to the world.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|If you are a fan of David Bowie, you will already have this cd. If not, what are you waiting for? Get it!!     If you are not yet a David Bowie fan, you will be after listening to 'Reality'. If you do not own any of his cd's, you can start with this one. It is good.     Also, check out 'Heathen' and 'Hours'. Then go for, 'Earthling' and 'Heroes'.     A must own is, The 30th Anniversary Edition of 'The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars'.    Also, 'David Live' is good. Some have been saying 'Stage', is better. I only have, 'David Live'.     \\"Buy Some, Try Some\\"
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System Of A Down have matured incredibly since their debut album. What was once a load of heavy slamming riffs and crunch with screaming vocals is now a refreshing blend of the old heavy combined with some originality and peace. Also the guitarist Daron Malakian sings almost more than Serj Tankian the singer, which works well as long as he only sings for short periods of time: the whiny high pitched voice gets annoying.  <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side- 5/10. It's an intro, so it's not going to get higher than a 5.  <br />2. B.Y.O.B- 10/10. BRILLAINT song with a great chorus and Daron's vocals give it an edge.  <br />3. Revenga- 8/10. Good, not the best.  <br />4. Cigaro- 9/10 A great song with funny lyrics and a WEIRD verse.  <br />5. Radio Video- 8/10- A super great chorus but the verse sounds like something out of an italian resaraunt.  <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song- 9/10- Cool riff, fast vocals.  <br />7. Violent Pornography- 10/10- Funny song, funny verses, funy lyrics, good chorus, brilliant ending.  <br />8. Question- 10/10- It's one of System's more peaceful songs (at times) and shows how they have matured their sound. One of the album's best.  <br />9. Sad Statue- 9/10- Another good song and good lyrics to go.  <br />10. Old School Hollywood- 9/10- The techno bit gets annoying but the chorus saves it and it has a good riff.  <br />11. Lost in Hollywood- 10/10-System's most quiet, mature song, sung entirely by Daron in, thankfully, such a way that his crooning does not make you want to rip your ears off. It's haunting sound is the best SOAD have ever produced.  <br /> <br />If you like System Of A Down and haven't got Mezmerize, GET IT. If you like metal and haven't heard of SOAD, GET MEZMERIZE. You're guaranteed to love it.
B0007TKH66|5.0|This is a great season, well worth watching. But, the way TV is going these days, everything is a soap (you can't even watch Battlestar Galactica unless you've seen them all). \\"To Be Continued\\" was the first credit of every episode by the last season of Enterprise. Even in the \\"Final Episodes\\" - the 4 parter on the 'Alternate Universe' (that DS-9 did so well with) never even comes to closure! \\"This is EMPRESS Sato, surrender or die\\", The End. What the??<br /><br />Regardless, this is a great season and worth owning for any Trekker. Everyone I talk to seems to hate Scott Bakula as the primary (I did too, but he grew on me after seeing this season).<br /><br />These are all stand-alone, edible for anyone stories, some with great moral questions (on a galactic scale of course) spinning the wheel of how the Primary Directive was forged, etc.<br /><br />It was a great start, but they had to ruin it. You will quickly run out of fingers if you try to count how many shows are '24' style.
B0002PZVH0|3.0|I came home late one night and couldn't get to sleep. Must have been the party favors but I was not having a good trip. I lay awake in bed for what seemed like forever. Eventually I decided to put on some music and this album just happen to be the one. All I remember was floating in and out of consciousness and then I woke up around noon the next day. This album saved me from a very long night of depression. Eno has such and explorative attitude on the very soup making up the atmosphere. It's much more deep than sounds and melodies. He dabbles in the science of molecular music.<br /><br />I only gave it three stars because compared to \\"APOLLO\\" or<br /><br />\\"ON LAND\\" it is only worth three stars. Check those out first.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is crude, rude, politically incorrect, but hell yeah, a whole lot of fun! Well, what do you expect from the makers of South Park?  <br /> <br />The setting of the movie is Today - in the wake of 9/11 and of transnational terrorism. Team America's the world police, equipped with \\"Thunderbirds\\"-like firepower and fancy transportation, whose mission is to strike at terrorists around the world. And what more, the main baddie's North Korea's Kim Jong Il and his band of middle eastern terrorist posse with WMD... hmm... a little too close to reality for comfort?  <br /> <br />This film is so full of itself/America that it gets most of its laughs from there. From location settings that takes reference point from America, to the current inane insensitivity of American forces on foreign soil, to pointing fingers at bad Intelligence, it is all insane fun from the beginning when pandemonium strikes, that you start to wonder who actually does more damage - Team America, or the terrorists themselves. <br /> <br />Another highlight of this movie is the songs! When you first hear the Team America Theme, with it's \\"America! F* YEAH!\\", you know you'd had better pay attention to the lyrics of songs to come, some of which pokes fun at Pearl Harbour, pokes fun at film-making (the use of montages), and you even have Kim Jong Il doing a solo number! As with most slapstick comedies, sometimes you just gotta spoof some classics, which includes Star Wars, Matrix and Top Gun. Also, if you enjoy MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch, then you'll also enjoy the numerous fight sequences in Team America, which is just as creative in its decapitations, and as bloody. <br /> <br />Another infamous scene that got a lot of attention, was the sex scene between 2 lead puppets. It's no holds barred, puppetry porn. Whatever positions you can think of, it's mimicked on screen. Moreover, the conversational dialogue that led them to making love, is totally inane. <br /> <br />Look out for appearances by familiar Hollywood faces, and political figures like Hans Blix, Tony Blair, etc, used without their kind permission more like, as they're put in really bad, but hilarious, light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00029LNHS|3.0|This CD is a departure for the Peas from their beginnings, and as another amazon reviewer has said, many tracks seem aimed at the teen crowd.  \\"Bridging the Gap\\" is still my favorite album of their's -- a bit rootsy, very funky and clever.  That said, I am looking forward to the next album -- having heard \\"Don't Phunk With my Heart\\" and seen the video.   <br /> <br />Although Fergie is a great addition with her vocal chops and 'tude, I wonder to what extent her addition to the group was a move calculated to grab the attention of more pop fans -- the TRL'ians of the world:  \\"hot chick with street cred and fashion sense\\" is a real crowd-pleasing artist category for both genders and all racial/ethnic groups these days.   <br /> <br />ANYWAY, I continue to give the Peas props for being unique and creative. They are not predictable and keep pushing buttons instead of relying on the so, so tired hip-hop vocabulary list that includes.....  Well, listen to any 50 Cent track and you'll know what I mean.
0060955775|2.0|If you expect the class you saw in the Alchemist, it will certainly disappoint you. If you are mood off/depressed, and what you want is a little peace of mind and happiness, don't read this book at all. A person with suicidal depression (who already possesses lots of negative energy or thoughts) may get more ideas to commit suicide. And if you really want to read it, better you follow it up with some spiritual stuff or read the Alchemist once again!
1592400876|5.0|... and a practical understanding of real-world language. <br /> <br />The book's commercial popularity is due to more than a \\"revenge of the nerds'\\" buying ecstasy.  The chapters contain real guidance for writing clearly while offering an iconoclastic tartness to counteract the potentially dry nature of the subject. <br /> <br />In one point in the book, Truss comments, \\"... these [examples of placement of apostrophes] are matters of style and preference that are definitely not set in stone, and it's a good idea not to get fixated about them.\\" <br /> <br />In a few short paragraphs she reveals some truly arcane grammatical minutiae and gives the reader permission to do what feels right. <br /> <br />Maybe it was only the nerd in me that made me giggle, snort, and tune out the outside world as I read this grammar book.  Or, maybe it was the enjoyment of Truss' insight on how to communicate more clearly in today's world of email ellipses and dumbed-down dashes.
B0000027F8|5.0|When you mention George Michael most people remember Wham! or do not consider him seriously as an artist. I recommend to all these people to put any prejudice aside and listen to this album. You may not like his style but he has one of the best voices around. I still think this is his best album to date with \\"Praying for time\\" being the best track.
B00005JKGK|5.0|(Other reviewers have well-described the plot/storyline, so I won't reiterate it here.) <br /> <br />This is a haunting, poignant film that tugs at the heartstrings--a touching story of sacrifice, longing, loving and caring. It's one of those rare films that is all around excellent: excellent acting, writing, cinematography and of course, story. It is a film that's destined to be a classic and can be watched by people of all ages and cultures. <br /> <br />Though a reviewer here complained about lifting text right out of Amy Tan's book as the film's narrative, she has forgotten that a film is a complete story unto itself and has to stand on its own whether a moviegoer has read the book or not. It's the narration, and the poetic, almost lyrical prose, that helps make this movie work and be true to its characters: simple, eloquent words couched in imagery are used throughout; This is how the Chinese language really is. (For example, what we call a turkey in English is called a \\"fire chicken\\" in Chinese. (The \\"fire\\" is the red comb on its head.)) <br /> <br />Yes, there are men in the film who are abusive, womanizers, adulterers and...well...twits, but they're found in all races and cultures, so to say that the film insults Asian men is ludicrous.  (As for the comment of one reviewer accusing Ms. Tan of marrying a white guy because of her disdain of Asian men, I (a white guy) married a Chinese woman not because I dislike caucasians but because I love a woman who happens to be Chinese.) <br /> <br />But back to the film... <br /> <br />It's a keeper. Guys, if you want to score big points by watching a \\"date film\\" or \\"chick flick\\" with your sweetie, this one is the one to rent/own...and I wouldn't be surprised if you grow misty-eyed, too.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I was a fan of Mariah Carey's way back when. I have her 1st four albums and then I sort of lost interest as I thought all her songs were starting to sound the same.Then along comes \\"MIMI\\" and I was hooked once again! This is the perfect compilation of songs to place Mariah firmly at the top of the heap once again.  I can't even pick a favorite as each song is simply awesome. The artists who lent their talents to the album give it a hip-hop feel and merge it with today's music.  Though I think any and all of the songs on this album are far superior to anything else being played on the radio right now. So for the new fans and the old - get out there and buy this album. It will have constant rotation on your CD player for weeks to come. . .I'm sure of it.
0062502182|4.0|<br />This is a little beauty. A great work from the Brazilian author. After finishing the book we might ask ourselves `don't we also see omens around us?' Though it is not just a `love story', we can feel the deep love between Santiago and Fatima. Yes, it is the universal language....worth reading but let me tell you one thing, this is not for those `realistic' people, and one should be imaginative to enjoy the book. <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|After listening to The Emancipation of Mimi, I did not have a problem with Mariah Carey's voice.  Personally, I like Carey's confident, soaring voice.  The songs on this cd are quite good.
B00016POFE|4.0|I picked this up on DVD-a on a recommendation on my newsgroup.  I was immediately impressed with the opening track (I'm a big Rush / Dream Theater / Fates Warning fan).  The surround mix isn't particularly aggressive, which can be a good thing.  It offers the proper ambience without going insane with channel bouncing or sounding unnatural.  The resolution is very good and the instruments can be heard clearly.  Well, almost. <br /> <br />Since no one has yet reviewed the DVD-a version, I feel there is something to share.  Where's the bass?  I mean there is hardly any .1 information at all.  My sub is nearly dead playing this DVD-a.  I realize that not every DVD-a can be mixed like Steely Dan's latest, but this mix definitely subtracts a star from an otherwise worthy musical performance.  My stereo is a reference system comprised of Krell, Classe Audio, PSB and a massive VMPS subwoofer all room tuned and set with proper SPL measurements.  I hope the new album on DVD-a fixes this mix issue as the music is insanely good, but feels a little too light like a good portion of the impact and delivery were left out.
B00008EY65|4.0|overall this is a great movie... no great acting or story but the whole movie just \\"works\\"... one of the best comic book based movies ive seen... this is what sin city should have been like... the cheesy acting & dialogue are way better than that suck-fest called sin city...<br /><br />the start of the movie reminded me a lot of the nazi stuff in indiana jones... but the hellboy nazis were not as goofy & lame as the ones in jones... until the end, which brings me to one of my biggest gripes with this movie...<br /><br />all the main villans were shown to be very smart & in conrol leading up to the final battle... then all of the sudden everyone loses their mind, start rambling like madman, & let hellboy do whatever he wants... wtf? lame! its like they got to writing the end & tacked on the same crappy ending from any number of other action movies...<br /><br />one other problem with the movie was the relationship between hellboy & selma blair... their \\"romance\\" was as interesting to watch as the blue guy eating rotten eggs in the fish tank...
0670033375|2.0|Jared Diamond's bestselling Guns, Germs, and Steel argued that geography trumped culture, and that the current privileged position of the West was therefore mostly attributable to the advantageous resources in, and location of, Western countries, rather than to Europe's singular values. Despite the allure of such a politically correct exegesis - President Clinton endorsed the book wholeheartedly - there were numerous criticisms of this determinist idea of natural accidents resulting in the present-day dominance of the West. At some point a Cleisthenes, Plato, Augustine, Magna Carta, Sistine Chapel, Thomas Edison, or Albert Einstein - and the thinking and substructure that produced them - is worth more than long, indented coastlines and concentrations of iron ore. Diamond seemed to be terribly confused about the course of 2,500 years of Western history: Environment, far from being a precondition for Western success, was often almost irrelevant to it.  <br /> <br />For example, how did the Ptolemies create an even more dynamic civilization than that of the earlier dynastic pharaohs, when they inherited from them a supposedly exhausted and increasingly salinized landscape? Or why did the palatial culture of Mycenae prove to be a dead-end society, and yet the radically different Greek city-state centuries later blossomed in the exact same environment? More immediately, are we to suppose that there are underappreciated micro-climates that separate Tijuana from San Diego, strangely different soils on the two immediate sides of the Korean DMZ, and something about those ever-changing lagoons of Venice that made it irrelevant in late Roman times, a world power in 1500, and once again a backwater by 1850? Did the environment of Britain improve from A.D. 400 to 1700 while Rome's declined, thus explaining why the former outpost of the Western world became its new center and vice versa?  <br /> <br />Never mind that these bothersome historical details point to a particularly innovative - and ever evolving - social, economic, and political Western paradigm that can not only destroy, but repair, and, yes, often improve on nature in a way not quite possible in other cultures. The hillside slums of Mexico City, Sao Paulo, or Calcutta may support Diamond's gloomy assessments of what population density and environmental ignorance have wrought, but why does such a theory break down when we look at civilized and relatively affluent life in similarly congested Tokyo and London? Instead of the hard work of sorting out the subtleties of how sophisticated Westernized cultures both succeed and fail in inhospitable landscapes, the morality tale of Guns, Germs, and Steel was soothing salve to the increasingly berated Westerner, who apparently was amused by the idea that he had not stolen, but bumbled onto, his embarrassing bounty. And so the book, presented in a chatty and often witty style, went on to sell a million copies.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Diamond sensed those inconsistencies and thus in his new book, Collapse, he attempts to demonstrate through case histories of small micro-climates from Easter Island and modern Montana to Iceland and Greenland how civilizations disintegrate: Mishandling of the fragile environment causes wars, famines, depopulation, and eventual breakdown - and we modern wastrels should learn from them all before it is too late. Of course, empires can seem to fall for other reasons, but usually historians fail to see that political and military causation \\"masquerades\\" deeper environmental degradation.  <br /> <br />Diamond's natural determinism and condemnation of the West's pathological means of exploitation are nothing new, but represent a synthesis of the previous pessimisms from Marx and Toynbee to Paul Ehrlich and Kirkpatrick Sale. Most scholars, however, would accept the notion that societies like those of the Egyptians, Romans, Aztecs, or Ottomans - civilizations that, unlike those of Diamond's tiny settlements at PitcairnIsland or Vineland, had millions of inhabitants - at some period in their growth, evolution, and maturity inevitably declined; whether abrupt or insidious, such breakdowns were largely due to government overcentralization and rigid bureaucracy, affluence and leisure among a bored elite, high taxation, and depopulation in the countryside - all of which made rulers insensitive to change and unable to react rapidly to the radically new stimuli of invasion, novel religions, internal dissent, and, yes, occasional natural challenge.  <br /> <br />In contrast to this broad historical picture, most of Diamond's examples are slanted: They involve fragile, mostly isolated or island landscapes that witnessed colonists, renegades, or adventurers who sought in their greed or ignorance to put too many people in the wrong place. Modern Montana cattlemen and miners, like Norsemen and Mayan big men of the past, are easy targets; Diamond breezily disparages them through comparisons to \\"modern American CEOs\\" and caricatured chauvinists who proclaim \\"the unconscious message, `We are Europeans, we are Christians.'\\" When the reader begins to suspect that these light, anecdotal impressions are either irrelevant to larger historical questions or themselves internally inconsistent, Diamond coughs out a necessary qualifier: \\"I am not claiming,\\" \\"On the other hand,\\" and \\"Nor am I . . .\\"  <br /> <br />The main problem, however, with this book is that Diamond's well-meaning, environmentally correct storytelling cannot impart any coherent lesson of why in fact societies fail. Environmental degradation, climate change, hostilities, political and cultural failures, and trade are cited as the roots of collapse, but are used so interchangeably that we never learn to what degree mismanagement of nature or of people brings on doom. As a result, when Diamond ventures into systematic analysis of historical questions that he knows nothing about, he has a predictable propensity to say things that are notsimply wrong but hilarious.  <br /> <br />Yes, Americans once clear-cut the northeast, but now it has more forests than ever - because, among other things, technology moved us beyond wood-burning fuels. Iceland lost its topsoil and trees and thus many of its early settlements - but modern technology, liberal government, and Western jurisprudence ensure that its current Scandinavian descendants inhabit a successful society despite its cold, denuded, and unfertile island. And if Diamond believes that is so because Icelanders finally got smart and now follow his environmentally correct nostrums, he should ask why that is so - or what would happen in a decade should they magically be transferred to Haiti or Yemen and, in turn, Haitians and Yemenis were to take over Iceland.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the wealthy, pampered 9/11 terrorists did count on the teeming slums of the Middle East for their base of support, and no doubt Rwanda's genocide likewise had elements of too many people expecting too much from too few resources, but such environmental explanations are in the end fatuous when seen in larger and far more important political and economic terms. A Singapore or South Korea - or Manhattan - shows that modern technology, free markets, and the rule of law create a fluid and ever responsive social structure that can trump tribalism, religious fundamentalism, and the miseries of material poverty, limited resources, and an unforgiving nature.  <br /> <br />Diamond also fails to see that his \\"masquerading\\" works both ways. If we historians are fooled into thinking environmentally degraded societies lose wars owing to military ineptness rather than resource depletion, then he is utterly incapable of seeing that material want is often a mere pretext for national delusion and aggression. Germany is more populous today on smaller territory than in 1939, when it advanced the bogus notion of Lebensraum; overcrowded contemporary Japan, Inc. does fine within its smaller borders without warring for a Greater Co-Prosperity Sphere. Few think that the Falklands were vital to Argentina's food supply.  <br /> <br />In an age of sophisticated fertilizers that can implant huge amounts of nitrogen into the soil through a variety of mechanical, chemical, and \\"organic\\" mechanisms, it is simply not true - as I can attest from 30 years of farming trees and vines - that in Montana \\"apple orchards, which were initially very profitable, collapsed, due to in part to apple trees' exhausting the soil's nitrogen.\\" Diamond laments that out-of-state homeowners are \\"careful to stay in Montana for less than 180 days per year in order to avoid Montana income tax and thereby [not] to contribute to the cost of local government and schools,\\" but ignores the logical corollary that many of his maligned affluent Californian interlopers (and other commuters like them from other states) already pay almost 10 percent of their salaries back home for services that they, as absentee residents, do not fully use.  <br /> <br />Diamond idealizes the Netherlands as one of the world's most environmentally sound countries, where the need to manage the tides has made it an especially communitarian culture of the \\"polter\\" - as if resource management will address unassimilated Islamic ghettos, or as if such environmental sensitivity extended to the more mundane task of cultural integration. (In any case, that country is in near paralysis from, and now furious at, the murder of Theo Van Gogh and Islamic fundamentalist threats to its democracy.) Similarly, Diamond's idea that the Australian continent not only cannot support its present small population, but is doomed unless it reverts to a more natural human community of 8 million is ludicrous. The recent history of Australia has actually seen a steady rise in the standard of living, directly connected with growing population and a newfound allegiance to free trade, open markets, and foreign investment - all of which have capitalized onthe rich Australian environment in novel and often sustainable fashion.  <br /> <br />Finally, the moral lectures about contemporary Western dissipation are sadly compromised by occasional hypocrisy. While I think Diamond is absolutely right that \\"wealthy people\\" often \\"insulate themselves from the rest of society\\" and \\"use their own money to buy services for themselves privately,\\" I also know that his own environment of Westwood and UCLA is not quite Bakersfield or Memphis, but one of the most affluent and secluded in the world. Diamond's ample reference in the text to dozens of overseas trips, and numerous sabbaticals and research grants the world over, testifies not merely to his privilege, but also to the success of the modern Western world in altering the environment. Safe and rapid global travel, modern medicine, and the security brought through jurisprudence - all developed over the same 2,500 years of Western exploitation that Diamond takes jabs at - are a world away from the brutish, more natural world of New Guinea that in the past he has often romanticized, but ultimately chooses to visit periodically rather than raise his children in on a permanent basis. Indeed, the exploitation of fuels, ores, and soils that Diamond seems to think is so often reckless and presages our own collapse is very often not reckless, and thus inseparable from his own current enlightened and rich existence.  <br /> <br />Parts of Collapse are a therapeutic and salutary reminder to recycle more, trade in our gas-guzzling SUVs, and cut back on the parathion, but sound history this book unfortunately is not. <br />
0553208845|5.0|Excellent book. Almost everyone love to travel and so did Hermann Hesse to Buddha's birth place. Very few people can understand the spiritual richness and depth while visiting a place. It is neither just geography nor the traditional outfits and customs. There lies the greatness of this author.<br /><br />( I didn't properly understand the need for stressing the word `Brahmin' wherever possible. I understand that Caste system still exists in India and this Brahmins are on the top of the ladder. Some believe that they have Aryan linage. Initially I got a feel of Nazis and adherents of Nazism behind this book who thought the purported `Aryan race' were superior to other races.  But how can it be? Hermann Hesse was condemned by the Nazi government and he was against the German militarism. I felt like I should have read the original work than the English translation to clear this misunderstanding).<br /><br />The Perl or gem we get from this book is the truth:  \\"wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sounds foolish\\" and that is the reason why Jesus could not convince that he was the son of God.<br /><br />Author gives us the truth that if we are in the spiritual path, what we need not do is spiritual shopping. There is no need to change his/her faith for finding the truth. If we are open, we can always learn from everything, even from a river. And he tells us that \\"the potential Buddha already exists in the sinner; his future is already there. The potential hidden Buddha must be recognized in him..\\"<br /><br />Why should I tell a lot and lot about the book? It will spoil the thrill. So, you read it or not? Don't read this book, be with it. And don't read this book just once,  at least the last chapter...read it again and again.
B0006284JQ|3.0|I think it is a wonder that these songs were ever played on the radio.  I also think that people wanted a new, young singer and they eagerly chose Britney Spears.  After listening to this collection of songs, I am not sure what to do with this music.  Not all female stars are dejected because they do not have boyfriends.  In addition, girls should not want to be slaves to boys, and girls should not want toxic boyfriends.  I think that more and more listeners need to pay attention to the lyrics in the songs, especially songs played on the radio.
B0007WF1WI|5.0|This cd,, is the best of britney.. all the songs are awesome.. dont doubt it.. just get it
B0002OERI0|2.0|<br />This album has some technically good songs with catching melodies;but one thing that bugged me is that most of the emotions given through the songs are fake. <br /> <br />Their first single from this album i guess,the boulevard of broken dreams;has some really artificial and silly lyrics.it is supposed to be lonelyness;but the lyrics are so fake,so simple and cliche that you hardly believe that the vocalist had ever really felt them. <br /> <br />Technically,it is a great album but in spirit;it is just some populer teenage boys singing about things they dont have the smallest idea about,things like solitude and misery.They fake emotions to be popular among teenagers,and they do it so well, but they are not enough to fool some decent listener who ever listened something real about gothic sadness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005V3Z4|4.0|If you enjoy movies that are a bit on the dark side and completely unclassifiable, Donnie Darko is the one for you.  Well done, thought provoking, funny, creepy, and disturbing all in one package.  Original to say the absolute least although, I'll admit, it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Pay no attention to the bad reviews from the shallow people who said it was \\"too weird\\" or \\"Just not that good\\".  It's supposed to be weird and if you like a film that makes you shudder as you're trying to figure it out then, again, this one's for you.  If not - don't waste your time.   <br /> <br /> You should plan on watching it several times to get the full effect as there is a lot going on and no one catches everything the first time around. <br /> <br /> In my honest opinion, a very well done original movie.
B00004SCX6|2.0|After the huge succes of her debut album ...Baby One More Time Britney already with the title sais what this album is about: It's more of the same. More teen pop. You actually could stick BOMT and OIDIA to eachother and you wouldn't even notice it were 2 different albums. Her first album had more variation of songs then this one. Most ballads are at the end of the album, because Britney is so bad at ballads. That was a smart choice. The songs are pretty short and the lyrics are all the time about love, letting down and dancing. The order of the songs is often the same an the bridge is often the melody sung with a different melody. However, the melodies are often great and the beats too. The album includes 3 phonecalls of Britney! <br /> <br />The titel track is danceable and has weird lyrics. The melody is one of the best of the album. The bridge is original. It features a talking scene between Britney and some guy. Stronger has good lyrics. britney sais she is independent and is the opposite of Baby One More Time. It is a more tougher Britney. In Where Are You Now britney proves she can sing, it features a scream of Brit that lasts long. But the ballad gets boring soon. <br />britney hasen't really got a voice to sing Dear Diary, a cute lovesong. It's at the end of the album and is a calm song. The album features a cover: I Can't Get No SatisFaction. The song starts slow but soon the beats join Britney. There isn't a lot different then the original version, a useless cover. <br /> <br />Lucky is about a girl that is famous and rich, she has everything but still she cries. It's a very kiddish song. What You See Is What You Get looks A LOT like OIDIA and BOMT, you could make 1 song of these 3 songs! They have excactly the same beats! Can't Make You Love Me is a good faster song with the best beats of the whole album and also one of the best melodies. Girl In The Mirror, Don't let Me be The Last To Know and When Your Eyes say it are not bad ballads. The problem is they can easially get boring. That is the problem of this album, you can listen to it a couple of times and really like it. But because the songs look a lot like eachother and the songs are simple, it soon gets boring.  <br /> <br />Warning: The melodies stay in your head, which is the strongest point of this album.
B00067BBQE|4.0|I must concur with the reviewers who say the production of this concert footage is very poor. If you're looking to watch Evanescence live in concert, chances are you won't find it here. This feels more like any music video than a concert. It has been edited to the nth degree and rarely focuses on one shot for longer than two seconds. Luckily, the DVD does have some redeeming factors, including the emotionally pained music videos for \\"Bring Me to Life\\", \\"Going Under\\", \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\". The behind-the-scenes bits are slightly entertaining, if nothing more. It's good to be shown that this band has a lot of fun on the road, giving the impression that they won't be quitting the business any time soon. <br /> <br />While the video aspect of the DVD is poorly done, the audio is much better, which is why, if it were possible, I'd recommend you buy the concert CD in place of the DVD. Anyway, Amy's voice is nicely familiar in concert, which I was unsure of; you know how some singers sound completely different live than on a recording? Well, she doesn't. Her voice falters during some of the fast-paced songs, but that's to be expected when she's running around and jumping on stage. I was particularly awed by the ballads; her powerful vocals combined with her beautiful piano playing was chilling, especially during \\"Breathe No More\\" and the band's hit, \\"My Immortal\\". I surprised myself to find that I really liked \\"Thoughtless\\", the band's cover of a KoRn song. I was never a KoRn person, or an alternative-rock-heavy-metal-of-any-kind person, but I was impressed with the way this song was performed by Evanescence. <br /> <br />The audio CD also includes a previously unreleased track titled \\"Missing\\". Much like the band's other ballads, this song is mellow, soft, boasting good vocals and painful yet beautiful lyrics. <br /> <br />In conclusion, Evanescence sounds very, very good on this CD. It is a real pleasure to listen to; it's just the DVD that, well, kinda sucks.
1582403589|4.0|Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead: Days Gone Bye (Image, 2004)<br /><br />Days Gone Bye is the first installment of what Robert Kirkman promises will be an epic graphic novel. (As I write this, Days Gone Bye has been out for less than a year, and vol. 3 is due to come out any day now; Kirkman is really cranking away on this one.) While it opens with one of the most common scenes in modern zombie lit, Kirkman's stated intention is very different than much of what we've seen recently, and at least in the first installment, the practice goes hand in hand with the theory.<br /><br />Rick Grimes is a Kentucky cop who gets himself shot at the opening of the story. He wakes up from a coma some time later to find a deserted hospital. Upon searching, he finds that the walking dead of the title have pretty much taken over the planet. Rick heads for Atlanta, seeking his wife and child, and meets up with a group of survivors. While zombies form the frame of the story, what's at the core of this book is the dynamics between the survivors; the zombies are just the spice to their meat.<br /><br />This is exceptional stuff. If the series continues to be this good, I can easily see it taking a place beside Watchmen on my very, very short shelf of the graphic novels I liked so much I actually went out and bought copies. ****
B000000H57|5.0|If you are a goth/rock type fan than you cant afford to pass this CD up. This is by far the best Type O Negative has to offer so far. Stand OUT Tracks are 2,12,5,6. Their last two albums just didnt cut it for me. If you want that atmospheric tone than this is the CD for you!!! His voice is unreal and fits the music so good. Stop reading and buy it now!
B000002L9S|3.0|This album is a huge improvement to her previous ones. It's not that simple anymore and has better beats and melodies. The lyrics are improved too. Also, the songs last longer. The bad thing is that it includes only 9 tracks and 1 ballad, what makes this album go downhill after all. Still, it's a classic pop album. <br /> <br />The album starts with Papa Don't preach, with good lyrics. She showed she was grown up. The intro distracts you, then suddenly the beats come. Open Your Heart has a very good melody and good beats. It's a fast love song. White Heat has a bad melody and is familair to Where's The Party. But Wher's The Party has got a better melody, and is the best song of the album. In live To Tell Madonna sounds pure and the moment when the song stops for a few seconds is well made. Not only the vocals, but also the music is important here. True Blue is a very girly mid-temp love song. The good thing about this song is that the melody is a classic one, but that's it. La Isla Bonita is a more faster ballad. Madonna says some sentences is Spanish and there are Spanish instruments used. Jimmy Jimmy is a kiddish song with a pretty good melody, but it really sounds terrible. It's a song for little girls. The little album ends with Love Makes The World Go Round, a love song with power. You can really feel the power of love when you hear it! <br /> <br />A little, but good album. You should buy it. Because it has classic melodies and great beats. The songs are variable and Madonna's vocals sound very pure. A good 80s album, don't miss it...
B0007GAERG|5.0|Three-time Grammy winner Mariah Carey was the biggest selling artist of the 1990's worldwide and became the second biggest selling female artist in history, only surpassed by Madonna.  She's sold over 140 million albums since her 1990 debut and has spawned fifteen number one hit singles, an amount only surpassed by Elvis Presley (18) and The Beatles (20).  Songs include \\"Hero\\", \\"One Sweet Day\\", and \\"Vision of Love\\".  She quickly became known as the lady with the seven-octave grand voice, one of the greatest in recent history.  Her competition included fellow grand voicers Whitney Houston and Celine Dion.  During the 1990's, the world saw her transformation from conservatively dressed/ contemporary pop to sexually dressed/ hip-hop.  Through everything she's become an inspiration to many artists that came after her (Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, Fantasia).      A few years have passed since Mariah Carey has made a major mark on mainstream music, her album \\"Rainbow\\" (1999).  She suffered from severe exhaustion and depression.  She moved from Columbia Records to Virgin Records with a $120 million six-album contract.  Virgin Records dropped her after only one year and one album.  She proceeded to Island/ Def Jam Records.  This decade has seen a film, \\"Glitter\\", that received disappointing reviews accompanied with a soundtrack that didn't sell to its expectations.  She followed with albums \\"Greatest Hits\\" (2001), \\"Charmbracelet\\" (2002), and \\"Remixes\\" (2003).  None of them propelled her back to major mainstream.     In 2005, she released her highly anticipated album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\".  This proved to be her best album in years.  Once again, she received the recognition she deserves.  Many call this \\"the return of the voice\\".  Indeed it is.  This album expresses her newfound freedom within her career and herself.  She shows that she is refueled energetically compared to her recent works.  There are some positive changes in her poise besides her wardrobe.  The world proved ready for Mariah once again.  This album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Charts, selling over 400,000 its first week.    \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" starts with her hit song \\"It's Like That\\".  This minimal hip-hop/ dance song wonderfully readies listeners for the remaining album.  The rest of it stays true to her hip-hop/ R&B sound that she's maintained since her album \\"Butterfly\\" (1997).  However, she experiments with various hip-hop sounds that give this album the variety that makes it fun.  Yet, it fits within the album beautifully.  The variety includes 70's R&B (\\"Say Something\\"), semi-crunk (\\"It's Like That\\"), modern hip-hop (\\"Get Your Number\\"), pop (\\"We Belong Together\\"), and gospel (\\"Fly Like a Bird\\").  With the help of multiple producers (Kanye West, The Neptunes, Johnny Wright, Jermaine Dupri), this album results as a masterpiece.      Though vocally, she shows less of her range and her grandness, her performances remain strong throughout the album.  She proves that less can be more.  She knows when to sing more grand and when to not.  She occassionally changes her vocal texture to blend with the background.  Her various vocal expressions prove her as a true artist.  Though her lyrics express less of her personal life, her performances continue to impress like she always has.  Her collaborations also perform well.  All give their individual song their own unique style that fits well with the overall album (Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Jermaine Dupri, Twista).  Thankfully, she hired talented artists.    \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is a must-have for Mariah Carey fans and anybody wanting true quality music.  This album proves that she is here to stay.  This is sure to please many listeners as it already has.      ***Expect Mariah Carey to receive at least three 2005 Grammy nominations: Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Urban/ Alternative Performance (\\"It's Like That\\"), and Best Female R&B Performance (\\"We Belong Together\\")

B0000A0DXA|1.0|I was so excited when I saw this DVD online. It said DIRECTOR'S CUT on the front UNEDITED, blah blah you know the rest. This DVD is presented on the outside package as the full length Feature Film, \\"Boogeyman 2\\". What you actually get is a chopped up edited piece of junk with actual scenes from the film sandwiched inbetween these boring interviews with the director Uli Lommel. This DVD IS NOT the full length Feature Film. Instead it is a cheap, dihonest crooked, misrepresentation of a product designed to fool people like me into thinking I am getting the real film. This is more like a documentary about Boogeyman 2. I am extremely furious at the makers of this DVD and the crook director called Uli Lommel. This is false advertising in the purest form. I wasted $13.39. Dont make the same mistake I did and just get the old 1992 VHS tape Boogeyman 2 from Movie Trading Company for $4.99. <br /> <br />Uli Lommel is a CROOK!.
B00005OM4N|3.0|After her first 2 albums that looked a lot like eachother Britney comes with the CD of her own name, 'Britney.' She decided to call the album like that because it's different then her previous ones. She felt like this is the piont she starts to become a true artist. And I have to say, I don't like Britney, but this album really IS a huge improvement! She shows us she is becoming grown up. She is not a little girl anymore, but neither a women. She is sexier then before and her voice sounds more grown up, but unfortunately not that strong anymore. She lost that strong voice she had when she was a teenager. The album has more variations of songs then her previous ones. The first track, I'm A Slave 4 U, is a real club classic with s steamy britney. Boys is also steamy but faster and danceable. Track 4 is a typical Britney ballad. She also made a cover of 'I Love Rock And Roll.' It sucks, forget about it. Then at the end there is another very girly ballad about love, there are only 2 ballads on the album. But that's fine, because Britney bettr stics to dance songs. She better leaves the ballads for other singers. This album is not that poppy anymore as her previous albums, but it shows different sides of pop music. Overprotected, Cinderella and Lonely are the best pop songs and they are totally different. Just like the other Britney albums, this one includes great dance beats and classic melodies. The bad thing is that the songs are pretty short so the album doesn't last that long with it's 13 songs. If Britney goes on like this, she may become a good singer sometime.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Rememeber the First Star Trek Film? It was nice to see the original cast back on the screen but the movie was not what the fans wanted. Plenty of Special Effects but a weak story.  The same can be said of this movie.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I won't try to recap all the positive things that have already been said by other reviewers for this album, but I will say this: don't try to judge the album on only one or two listens. Unless you're some kind of genius, you can't do it (as some so-called \\"professional\\" reviewers have apparently tried). The music is too layered and varied rhythmically and lyrically to be able to pick up everything all at once. I had to listen to it at least about 6 times before I could begin to anticipate all of the music's subtleties, and there really is joy in the anticipation (\\"Sunspots\\" being my current favorite example). Even the album's most accessible track, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", takes a few tries to really get into (no wonder that as of this writing, it is again the number-one single on the Billboard charts). But because of all that inherent complexity, the music has a low burn-out rate; most mainstream music is only listenable for a couple-dozen times at most before the listener gets bored with it. \\"With Teeth\\", on the other hand, has staying-power (I've listened to the album at least about 40 times so far, if not more...I've since lost count, and I'm not bored of it by any means).<br /><br />Just give the music an honest chance, and you won't be disappointed. Yes, Trent's back, as good as (though, arguably, *better* than) ever.
B00080Z53O|5.0|In the wake of the Terry Schiavo controversy, Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's sensitive and intelligent examination of a quadriplegic's battle for legal euthanasia is a welcome oasis of sanity.  The central character, a quadriplegic named Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly acted by Javier Bardem), is an impressive individual who, despite a rich intellectual and emotional life, desires to die.  All of the supporting characters are beautifully realized, and we can easily relate to his affection for them, as well as his distress at the loss of dignity and privacy that flows from being entirely dependent on them. The film gives a fair hearing to the characters who, either because they love him, or for religious and moral reasons, disagree with his goal, but ultimately argues that \\"living is a right, not an obligation.\\"  Despite the depressing subject matter, the film was visually beautiful and a pleasure to watch.
B000002MUW|3.0|After Erotica is was expectable Madonna would make a slow album, to go in the complete other direction of Erotica, because the public didn't like it. Well, she made the album slow overall but the lyrics weren't that brave. This album is an improvement to Erotica. The songs match eachother well and the background vocals match Madonna perfectly and also the songs. The album can be played without skipping songs, it flows really well. It isn't a mix of different kinds of music, and the songs are in a good order. The album includes 11 long tracks. The beats aren't good most of the times but it's supposed to be like that. This is an album to play when you come home from work. <br /> <br />Survival is a great way to open the album, it's probably about the critics: She will survive, whatever the critics say. Madonna isn't scared by the critics. Secret is a simple guitar song with a good melody. The next track, I'd Rather Be Your Lover has chorus that sucks and the song is quite boring overall. Don't Stop is a meaningless pop song with a bad melody and beats. Inside of Me is a memory song, but it sounds very sexual. A whispering Madonna sounds well here, this is a good song. Human Nature is again a reation at the critics. The beats are good but again, the melody is boring. The lyrics are good: 'I'm not sorry. It's human nature.I'm not your b**ch don't hang your s**t on me.' <br /> <br />Forbidden Love is a better song. It's a quiet ballad that maybe passes by without you really relise it. It really brings you into a dreaming world. Love Tried To Welcome Me is a bit more exciting ballad. The melody is better and the song isn't that simple. The intro sounds gorgeous! Sanctuaruy is a mysterious song where madonna sings high. There are a lot of special effects here and artisticly this song is very good. Bedtime Stories is a different song then the others. It's a dance song but without good beats. It doesn't really have a melody. It is a sexual song and becomes very attractive with time. There is a connection made between Sanctuary and Bedtime Stories, that way the song doesn't sounds completely different anymore. The album ends with the best song of the whole album. Take A Bow was a huge hit in the US, spending 7 weeks at n1. It is very long and has a great melody. Madonna doesn't sing together with the lasies, but they both sing different lines. <br /> <br />A pretty good album! You can buy it, it won't be a waste of money.
630463949X|5.0|I have been watching this DVD on and off for almost a year now. It is spectacular in all respects. Without repeating all the praise justly heaped upon this production by other reviewers, let me just say this: this is worth getting if only to see Lindsay Buckingham play the guitar. The man is a genius, he must be one of the most underrated guitarists out there today. Fantastic stuff, especially on Go Insane and I'm So Afraid (his guitar solo on the latter blows me away every time I watch it).
0790730960|2.0|Look the first Burton-directed Batman film with Jack Nicholson as the Joker scored well enough but this movie with Devito sucking bigtime as the Penguin is just putrid. Outside of his Taxi series DeVito really bites. On other matters while I like comely Michelle Pfeifer a lot in this movie I don't understand how her character of Salina becomes crazy. The fall hit her head?
0061015725|2.0|I bought this book on CD (abridged version) because the plot sounded intriguing.  I managed to finish the entire book (so it wasn't completely without merit), but I was disappointed.  The story was not very engaging or believable.  Too many coincidences.  Several of the plot lines were just plain silly.  I appreciate a dose of real science in my fiction, but in this case the extrapolation from the science was absurd.  The book had no other redeeming virtues to compensate for these deficiencies.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Why is a British man doing the commentary on a western film? That's much too ironic and inappropriate. As for the film itself it is definitely the single greatest westrern ever made outranking THe Searchers and Leone's own excellent The Good The Bad and The Ugly. The camera shots are breathtaking, the acting with Fonda leading the pack in a rare bad guy performance are all outstanding, and the story is effective. A winner.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Normally I will go into a lot of detail when reviewing a cd here, but presently I am tongue-tied; there just aren't words good enough to express how truly amazing this double disc set is.  I have been a fan of Ryan's for a few years now, and I have to say that \\"Cold Roses\\" literally blew me away from the very first listen.  There is much diversity to be had in the songcraft and musicianship; Mr. Adams and the Cardinals are in top form, and each song shines with it's own brilliance. While I love the entire album two songs in particular really stand out for me: \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive\\", which is heartbreakingly beautiful, and \\"Blossom\\", a bittersweet gem....both songs made me want to cry, the emotions they stirred in me were that powerful (and I can say in all honesty that I don't run across too many tunes that affect me on such a level).  This is without a doubt one of the best albums I have heard thus far this year, and Ryan and his bands' best, period (again, in my humble opinion). It will be interesting to hear the next 2 releases he has planned for this year, after creating this masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, don't miss this incredible album!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...this really is as good as everybody's saying. it's considerably better than the vast majority of tv shows in existence - and it's leaps and bounds ahead of pretty much all other sci-fi (which imo is often two-dimensional and silly). <br /> <br />why is it better? for many reasons, including plots, writing, acting, cinematography, effects etc., etc., but for me the biggest thing about Firefly is that, as a result of all these elements, i found myself actually CARING what happened to these characters. i found myself emotionally involved with a group of fictional characters - something i almost never experience - and owing to the obvious love that every member of the cast and crew have put into the production (see the DVD extras, as well as the evidence of the finished episodes themselves), there is NO weak link, no irritating defect or mistake detracting from my involvement and immersion in their lives. coming from a cynic like me, there's no higher praise i can give it. <br /> <br />this is a show that has a huge heart without overdoing the sentimentality - the very finest tv has to offer, imho. i think this is why it has attracted such praise from so many people. i can't recommend it enough. do yourself a favour and buy it.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Enough is enough, folks.  Sure, this girl ain't no Mariah Carey --though in her earliest works (such as \\"Soda Pop\\") she sounds quite Christinaish-- but she's got a unique enough sound to be distinguishable on the radio.  Can this be said about all teen sensations?  Let's talk about rappers: they don't EVEN sing.  Can they still be categorized as \\"singers\\" for speaking with rhythm?  Uh huh, thought so.  Britney Spears, like her or not, has become one of pop music's biggest superstars - and most controversial.  She's had a slew of No. 1's since her 1998 uber-smash \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" and has finally garnered that Grammy that's eluded her since her first nominations.  In the Zone shows us a more electrocized Spears but the latter ballads, should-be hit \\"Shadow\\" and Britney-composed \\"Everytime,\\" show the public the real girl behind the facade.  Greatest Hits can be called such because she has had enough hit-age to put one out (\\"greatest hits\\" doesn't mean \\"every single\\").  Congrats Britney.  You've done a great job here.
B00005UW9T|4.0|First of all, unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not think the historical inaccuracy of this film constitutes a problem.  All historical movies are inaccurate to some extent, and this particular film does not purport to reconstruct historical events, but rather to play on a fantasy, on an interesting rumour.  What I did find rather problematic was the fact that we are supposed to identify with the Romanov family, that is to say, to endorse power, tyranny, and aristocracy, at the expense of harsh social realities. We are supposed to feel regret over the lost splendor of the Romanov court, when most Russians did not live like this. Retrospectively, the Russian revolution brought misery and suffering to many, but the idea that one is supposed to sympathize with the czar's family and their plight seems to me problematic. <br /> <br />  <br />Having said that, the film in itself is quite good though. The animation is flawless, the songs are OK, though only the theme song, Once Upon A December, is great, and the title character is very likable. I enjoyed watching the development of the relationship between Anastasia and Dmitry. However, there were some weak links in the plot, such as the fact that Dmitry and his companion are defined as complete crooks at first, and suddenly we learn that actually they're great human beings.  Not that this is implausible, but I thought the transition from one state to another was too abrupt.  I would have liked to see a gradual development in their characters. <br /> <br />Personally, I did not like the white bat character, which, to my taste at least, failed to provide the comic relief it was intended for. I also disliked Rasputin, whose character I felt made no sense in this context, nor do I think is it clear to the unitiated viewer who he is. I did not find him believable as a character posing an obstacle for the heroine, and I think a more realistic solution, such as, I don't know, real bolsheviks pursuing Anastasia, would haveworked better.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, if one can get over these weak spots, the movie is quite enjoyable, and overall I indeed liked it, because: <br />  <br />The Anastasia character is credible and I liked her throughout; she is beautifully dubbed by Kirsten Dunst (as an 8 year old) and then by Meg Ryan (as the 18 year old Anastasia);  <br /> <br />\\"Once Upon a December\\" is a very good song, and I liked the use of it to express nostalgia, or as an aid to memory;  <br /> <br />The theme of lost and recollected memory is very well treated;  <br /> <br />The opening, with the dowager empress's voiceover, is strong;  <br /> <br />The animation is fantastic.  <br /> <br />Despite all its faults, the movie is definitely watchable, entertaining, and worthy of repeated viewings. <br />
B000058983|5.0|I bought this album the first week it was released in the summer of '67, on the strength of Love's first two releases, &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;De Capo&quot;. A band in Jac Holzman's stable, signed before the Doors, Paul Butterfield et al. on his newly established Elektra label, no one was prepared for the acoustic/electric/symphonic odyessy Arthur Lee, the band's leader and main vocalist crafted. While the album or no song on it charted above the top one hundred, underground radio and impassioned word of mouth slowly grew the albums' popularity, and over the year's, legend....to the extent that an uncharted album made it to #40 on Rolling Stones all-time greatest album list.<br />  While over thirty-five years old, the bands' use of strings, horns, over-laid lyrics and juxtaposition of flavorful acoustic codas with searing electric guitar punctuations have created an album fresh and undated, timeless and as affecting today as on it's release.<br />  The bands personnel changes, and Arthur Lee's subsequent troubles with the law do nothing to diminish the brilliance and the feel of the music, it is an aberration, but one held dear by those who were there from the beginning.<br />  Rather than parse the album, song by glorious song, suffice it to say this L.A. (quite possibly the first inter-racial) band created an album that may now have as many passionate adherents as any work released in the sixties. It has been my experience that those introduced to this album on it's release in the sixties have only become larger fans with the passage of time, and those newly exposed to Forever Changes marvel at it's timeless musical footprint.<br />  While it is interesting to note, in an historical perspective, that Jim Morrison was an Arthur Lee and Love fan on Sunset Strip, that Jimi Hendrix played and recorded with the band, and that Arthur Lee has released a critically acclaimed (at age 61!) live London concert of the Forever Changes album, strings, horns and all (highly recommended - original fans of the album are guaranteed to tear up), the most important fact to be taken away from this review is this - if you know of the album, I'm preaching to the choir. If by some chance you are unfamiliar with this work...I am so jealous, you get to experience what we fans did so long ago, and it is priceless.hly recommended - original fans of the album are guaranteed to tear up), the most important fact to be taken away from this review is this - if you know of the album, I'm preaching to the choir.

B00005QFE5|5.0|<br />This is a simple plot well rendered. \\"The Road Home\\" consists of a frame story, filmed in black and white, and an embedded story (a story within the story), filmed in vivid colour. It is a love story between an illiterate young woman and a village teacher, set in a superbly filmed background - it really makes you want to travel to China. It is a story of great love and rare devotion of a woman to a man. Though only a simple village girl, the heroine achieves her goal through sheer dedication and perseverance. Despite the straightforward plot line, the film is full of symbols, such as a food bowl, a hair pin, a grandmother who wept when her husband died until she became blind, and the road home itself. I found the many references to popular Chinese beliefs and superstitions fascinating, I've learnt a few things about Chinese culture, and I was left with a desire to explore more about it. The film also has a political dimension, not letting us forget that the love story is set in the years of the Cultural Revolution in China, and as a result we get a poignant reminder of how political issues can interefere with normal everyday life.  <br /> <br />The cinematography is superb - the fields, the heroine's clothes, the food, the bowl, are filmed in vibrant, eye-pleasing colours, and enchant the eye.  <br /> <br />This film is a gem, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!  <br />
0385513755|4.0|If you haven't read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" yet, you may as well get started now to find out what all the fuss is about. First published in 2003, TDVC is still on the New York Times bestseller list an amazing 112 weeks later. Now this illustrated edition adds to the buzz. Doubleday gets my vote for the best book marketing department on Earth. Hands down.<br /><br />Why has this book been so successful? Why has it spawned an entire cottage industry of follow-on books? The writing is OK, not great. The plot is fun to follow, but nothing like the masterful work of Harlen Coben or Dennis Lehane. And the character development is only average. So what's the big deal?<br /><br />Let's see: Murder in the Louvre. Tantalizing artistic clues propel our American hero and French heroine in search of the truth -- not just about the murder, but also about the \\"true\\" lineage of Jesus Christ. Religious fanatics (bad guys) try to stop them. And the chase is on!<br /><br />Along the way, we learn many disturbing \\"secrets\\" that the Catholic Church has been supressing for centuries. Only a shadowy society of geniuses has kept the truth from being wiped away entirely. Thankfully, they've left a coded message for us in Europe's great artwork and architecture. (See the abundant beautiful photos and illustrations in this version.)<br /><br />Bingo! Dan Brown has discovered the magic formula for a bestseller in the age of religious and political upheaval: Mix one part evil conspiracy, one part fringe theology and one part pseudo-history. Throw in some famous names, then season with the ultimate ingredient: Claim it's all true! People are buying the book in droves. It's a cultural phenomenon like the Beatles first trip to America. And now it's a coffee table book, too.<br /><br />Of course, Dan Brown's \\"facts\\" are mostly nonsense. Anyone who thinks the Vatican has supressed the \\"Sacred Feminine\\" hasn't set foot in a Catholic Church recently. (See all those Virgin Mary statues?) But hey -- this is American pop culture.

0670033375|5.0|Decay and ruin.  <br /> <br />Decay and ruin is one of the chief archetypes of all literature and all history.  <br /> <br />It begins with the Bible when we're given the descent in metaphor from the golden age, to the silver, and on down to the feet of clay. It also exists in Ovid's Metamorphoses where we're given a golden age that lapses in to decline. Eden, also from the Bible falls in to this trope. We have Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which is self-explanatory. In other mythology, we're given Atlantis, which is a western myth of decline and ruin from a golden point of civilization. Neo-platonists and Romantic poets both yearned for the time of beauty and logic that was Ancient Greece.  <br /> <br />Even in modern times, we often look to prior eras with nostalgia: the ballroom dancing of the early 20th century to the Victorian courts of the 19th century. We decry these times as the worst of all possible times. We look with nostalgia on times of the unspoilt America where salmon were so numerous one could walk across the Columbia river, the Great Plains were filled with countless buffalo, and the Appalachains thick with old growth woods. Humanity carries it with a clinging guilt wrought from the exploitation of this earth in which we live that pervades our culture and our literature.  <br /> <br />Literature--particularly speculative fiction--is redolent with the decay and ruin of prior ages. Tolkien's cosmology is one, long, epic decline and fall. Unnumbered works of science-fiction take place in the ruin of a golden age beginning with Asimov's Foundation (itself based upon Gibbon) to more recent work such as Alastair Reynolds' \\"Glitter Band\\" turning in to the \\"Rust Belt\\" in Chasm City. The (endless) Wheel of Time (Jordan), the (equally endless) Shannarra series (Brooks), and the (finally ending) Sword of Truth (Goodkind) are just a few of the madly popular authors operating in speculative fiction today who take advantage of the archetype of decay and ruin.  <br /> <br />Certainly one need look no further than religious authorities of every stripe who constantly explain how this time is the most evil of all times and \\"the end is near.\\"  <br /> <br />This is why Jared Diamond's Collapse, which is unquestionably a work of science, takes on a strangely mythic tone. Why should these times be the worst of all times. Why should we constantly feel that things are getting worse? Why should we nod sympathetically to people who worry about bringing children in to \\"these times?\\" How is it, as the title implies, that we so often choose to collapse?  <br /> <br />Collapse gives reason and voice to many of these nameless fears. In a work that is as objective and non-judgmental as any thing we have ever read, Diamond explains in rational terms the decline and fall of civilizations. It's a work of immense scope, daring, and importance. This daring is something so vital and necessary to great authors that we feel this book--while the theme itself is important enough to draw many intellectually curious people--it will resonate strongly with the audiences more used to fictional genres. It is an excellent follow-up to his Pulitzer-prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel, which chronicled the \\"why's\\" of civilizations rising. It is as relevant for any person concerned with the environment to any person concerned with the longevity and success of business and Capitalism--and we say this from the position of quite staunch Capitalists! <br /> <br />While not strictly environmental in tone, it takes on that mantle as it very carefully examines several different civilizations and their collapses. The environmentalism stems from the fact that the collapses were apparently so inextricably linked to environmental pressures. But this is no political rant. At each point, from ancient native American societies to modern days, Diamond examines the conflicting pressures on the people actually living there. Without apologizing for them, heexamines their follies as well as their reasons that give rise to the ruination of local environments. He equally celebrates some very large corporations who go to superb lengths to preserve the local environments and provide sustainable growth as well as some atrocities occurring at the hands of very small \\"mom-and-pop\\" fisheries and other ventures. This reasoned approach makes good cause for Diamond becoming the arbiter between the bitter feuds between Limbaugh's \\"environmental wackos\\" and Greenpeace's \\"evil, greedy corporations.\\"  <br /> <br />But it is the mythic notion that truly anchors this book and makes it so appealing to the intellectually curious. When we wonder why Arthur's court fell, or why Sodom and Gomorrah fell to wickedness, or why Enron executives defrauded investors, or why people wail about the rainforests, or why the people of Easter Island fell to the straits they now find themselves in... All of these questions are somehow given answer in the calm narrative of Diamond. As all good non-fiction does, it suddenly provides a solidity and reality to our more fanciful speculations. When he painstakingly describes the decline of Easter Island one is able to imagine the fall of Rome. When one learns about the political division that rip the state of Montana one can appreciate the perils of China and even an apocalypse of the earth.  <br /> <br />What Diamond gives so much better than almost any other book is a perspective: a vantage point by which a civilization can be seen and judged and to which one can measure one's self.  <br /> <br />And this is quite a gift.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have long been an avid fan of Phantom of the Opera.  Having seen it on stage, albeit not with Michael Crawford, I didn't think that a movie could do it justice.  There is no comparison to listening to Andrew Lloyd Webbers music in real life.  However, the luscious scenery and costumes were terrific and the music was just as wonderful in film.  The only downfall was that you really need to experience yourself what it is like to watch the giant chandiler being hauled up over the audience.  I have been a great fan of Gerard Butler ever since seeing him in Attila.  He does make a strikingly handsome rough.  I was more than surprised and delighted beyond measure hearing him sing the music to this; so much so that I can't stand to listen to my tapes with Crawford singing it.  Emmy Rossum also is perfect Christine to Butlers hauntingly handsome, and tragic Phantom.  I have discovered that their singing along with Patrick Wilson's who plays Raoul is so much better than what I have heard before.  Minnie Driver is an absolute delight as Carlotta.  I found myself torn between which man I wanted Christine to go with in the end.  But, true to my fantasy of Gerard Butler, his portrayal of the Phantom made me root for him instead.  I just wanted to go through the screen and try and comfort this poor, lonely soul.  A movie you won't regret buying.

B0000C83YJ|5.0|From the spotty debut Kissing to Be Clever to this in a little over a year is simply amazing. Colour By Numbers is an embarresment of riches. The only song here I do not like is the monster hit single Kharma Chameleon, it grates on my nerves in  a way I cannot describe. From pure pop, to dance, to gospel styled ballads, to reggae. All the bases are covered, in a way that only a band like Culture Club could pull off. They were the Kings of Pop Radio for a brief time in the early 80's, and could do no wrong. And Colour By Numbers is the apex of their reign.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Going from my title and having read many of the reviews that are written about this album I feel I should point out that this album came out almost a decade ago.  At that time, the music scene was MUCH different.  Grunge had recently come to an end, r&b was still newish and 80s/90s rap was a dying breed.  We had an influx of boy/girl bands singing mindless drivel about the other sex and we had a, for the most part, underground record label in Death Row records.  When this album came out, it broke the mould.  It fused rap and r&b and let every other rapper out there what the public wanted.  This album, though probably not as relevant today as it was, was a reflection of the times Snoop and his compadres were living through.  See it as a reflection and you'll not be dissapointed.   <br /> <br />There's not one particular song on the album that stands out and that's the sign of a good album.  It flows from song to song with an eloquence meant only for a classic.  Buy this album even for nothing more than to have in your collection.   <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Short `n Sweet  <br /> <br />Mesmerize may be the shortest album to come out so far this year, but it's one of the freshest, wildest rides of the upcoming summer.  Clocking in at a mere 35 minutes (what?!!!) you may feel shortchanged - until you listen to it.  In those 35 minutes SOAD packs in enough wallop to get your blood pumping and clear out the cobwebs from your mind - and your speakers.  In addition to being (for the most part) fast and furious, the lyrics run the gamut from criticism of America's current policital regime and its destruction of our youth to a hilarious adolescent rant on penis size and all that that encumbers.   <br /> <br />As usual with this band the vocals are challenging and complicated featuring plenty of freshly weird harmonies and an almost operatic furiousness that bar-for-bar matches the hard edged, guitar driven melodies.   <br /> <br />Now if only they'd include a few more U.S. cities on this tour!  Damn, this is one rockin' good disc . . . Get it . . . NOW!!!! <br />
B000001F3C|3.0|The studio version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" really pales in comparison with the live version. The \\"S.B.S\\" mix on \\"War\\" is just really odd and lacking in clarity and punch. It sounds like it was recorded in mono with everyone in the same room going through the same mic. And it almost sounds like an acoustic version of the song. I've always found the arrangement of \\"S.B.S\\" awkward anyway and thought it lacked momentum. I mean, it's basically a march. \\"Seconds\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" are good. \\"Like A Song\\" has a lot of raw energy, but isn't a terribly memorable song. \\"Drowning Man\\" is one of the few real ballads U2 has recorded and is a pretty unique track in the U2 catalog in terms of arrangement and song-writing. But Bono's surprisingly trite lyrics for the song drag the quality down.     The second half/B-side of the album is basically all filler, with the exception of \\"40,\\" which has some pretty melodies and a great sonic aura which kind of points in the direction they would head into with their next album. I doubt U2's ever performed \\"The Refugee\\" or \\"Red Light\\" in concert. I remember reading an interview with Edge a long time ago in which he said he didn't care much for \\"Surrender\\" because the lyrics didn't really mean anything.     I guess \\"War\\" is widely considered to be one of U2's definitive albums, but while it features some great moments, overall I've always found it to be pretty inconsistent.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Ok, i'll admit i downloaded this album early since i was too impatient to wait for its release(i have bought the album since, however) and ever since the first time i listened to it i've been hooked. Reminds me a lot of their first cd with the fast, heavier music, though the vocals are, as you can see from other reviews, different. Personally, i have no problem with Daron's voice. It's different. It doesn't sound bad it's just plain different. So it's weird, get over it. Not gonna go through the songs since others have/will do it and i'm too lazy.    Favorites: Revenga, BYOB, and Sad Statue.
B00000K3D4|5.0|As a kid i loved this movie and still do adore it completely! I think i saw it about two/five times as child and it stuck in my brain so completely that when i was 15 i went on a complete rampage to find it, which i did, on VHS. I just really liked the film for it's characters, the colour, the sheer eccentricity of Bowie and the Goblins, everything! But especially Sarah, even more so now when i'm 17 and can relate to her threshold crisis. Who doesn't want to escape reality for a little while? I know i did and when i was younger i wanted to go on that adventure of hers... to somewhere where i could be the hero of the piece, and not adamsel in distress. Even as a child i hated the idea of having to be rescued by a man, so it was a refrrshing change to see a girl rescuing the boy (even if he had no idea, and could only drool!!) A brilliant film any child would adore it, boys and girls. boys for the adventure side and cool monsters and girls for the ball scene, Sarah, basically no kid could reasonably hate this film unless they have some weird fear of puppets!!
B0002BO0AS|4.0|To be honest I didn't like this cd when I first listened to it. But, it grew on me and now I cant stop listening to it. Heavy, yet melodic Uneath is an amazing band. Adam D's production work is amazing as usual.  <br /> <br />Favs: Zombie Autopilot, Great Divide, Lie to Purify

0060531053|4.0|There's no question but that this book has been the Bible for many homebrewers.  My own copy is quite well-worn.  However, beginners should know that the instructions for extract brewing can quite adequately be set out in about 2 or 3 pages.  Extract brewing is barely more difficult than baking a cake, so producing a whole book on the topic requires somewhat the same type of padding as occurs in diet books.  The short instruction sheets my homebrew store supplied were plenty adequate to teach the topic, in the sense of getting started.  The detailed discussions of biochemistry may be of interest to some, but are certainly not needed for basic brewing.  Only a few recipes are included, so this book really doesn't suffice as a recipe guide.    Homebrewers ready for all-grain brewing will of course need more information and instruction, for which Mr. Papazian's \\"Homebrewer's Companion\\" is a good start; it repeats enough from this first volume that my advice would be to buy \\"Companion\\" instead, when you're ready to go all-grain.  A single volume that combined both books, taking beginners from their first batch of extract brew into all-grain brewing, would be a perfect thing.
B00024BHTC|2.0|I've loved Nightwish from the moment I heard their Oceanborn album. The music was powerful, the lyrics varied between weird and brilliant, the melodies memorable and inspiring and the musicianship first class. <br /> <br />You could feel the rumblings of the band losing their way on Century Child, which wasn't a bad album thanks mainly to a few outstanding tracks amid the mediocre rest. <br /> <br />On Once, the band has veered completely off the road and is stuck in a ditch. They employ a full orchestra, and for me this is the downfall of the album. Now trapped between metal/rock and philharmonic theatrics, Nightwish fails to do either genre justice, and manage only to churn out an album that can at best be described as orchestra driven progressive rock. When the orchestra kicks in it stops sounding like metal, and when they go the metal route it's mostly in the form of hard but repetitive riffs with Emppu's searing, melodic guitar solos sorely missing, replaced by violins, trombones and trumpets. Catchy melodies are almost non-existing and I found myself, for the first time since discovering the band, not listening a Nightwish album all the way through on first listen because, quite simply, I got bored with what I was hearing. <br /> <br />The album opens with Dark Chest Of Wonders and Wish I Had An Angel, two hard songs which aren't bad but doesn't come anywhere near the likes of Stargazers or Dead To The World from previous albums. This is followed by Nemo, just about the only fresh and decent melody on the entire album. Halfway through Emppu embarks on a superb guitar solo that lasts all of 6 or 7 seconds. Why waste a guitarist with the uncanny ability to churn out hauntingly beautiful solos like this? Let the guy play. <br /> <br />It's here that the album seriously loses its way. Planet Hell sounds like a night at the theatre, so bombastically overbearing is the orchestra in its opening sequence. Creek Mary's Blood is an ok ballad, but again the dominating orchestra reaches a level of near cheesiness when you remember that you're listening to a supposed rock/metal band - there's more trumpet and violin in this song than guitar. The song ends with someone talking in what I'm guessing is an Indian language for about a minute and a half. Since you can't understand what he's saying, this is just daft and tedious to sit through. <br /> <br />The Siren, Dead Gardens and Romanticide are pretty generic Nightwish fare - none of them are bad songs, but in the same breath none of them can really compete with anything on Oceanborn. Ghost Love Score again has almost no electric guitar other than in the background on it, with the orchestra dominating almost the entire song. <br /> <br />The last two songs, Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan and Higher Than Hope, can both be classified as ballads, but neither grabbed my attention or gave me goosebumps like Sleeping Sun did when I heard it the first time on Oceanborn. They epitomize the spirit of this album - fair, but nothing special. <br /> <br />In the end, Once is a thoroughly forgettable album from a band that seems to have lost the ability to craft a strong tune - their soaring melodies and Tarja's inspired singing are what distinguished this band from the usual metal fare. On Once Tarja still sounds like an angel, but the flat melodies, over-the-top orchestra and repetitive metal riffs all serves to dull the emotional impact of her wonderful voice. <br /> <br />Album highlight - Nemo, the only song that sounds like the Nightwish I've come to know and love. Nightwish should drop the orchestra - it doesn't add any power to their music, quite the opposite. Stick to the basics and allow Emppu to do something other than play simple 3 or 4 note metal riffs on his guitar. The guy's too talented to waste like that.  <br /> <br />Once could have been a more than decent album. Unfortunately the band managed to thoroughly butcher it. Oceanborn and Wishmaster are still their best albums, and they'llbe wise to not veer too far from that formula. The band will do well to let Once stand as their failed experimental album, and get back to basics: driving rock/metal with soaring melodies, none of this shapeless progressive orchestral nonsense.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|This movie proves once again that Trey Parker and Matt Stone just don't have the chops for a feature length movie and should really consider hiring a professional screenwriter if they're serious about this.  Like the South Park movie, Team America was very funny, when it was funny.  Unfortunately, the rest of the time it was mired in obvious filler.  The movie started out with a bang, the puppet movements were funny, and it's send-up of current events was right on target.  Too bad it had to go downhill from there.<br /><br />It begins when Team America flies to the rescue in Paris, protecting its innocent citizens from terrorists.  Naturally, Team America does more damage in their rescue than the terrorists probably dreamed of doing.  One of the Team is killed and must be replaced, so they recruit an up and coming Broadway actor to use his acting skills to fight for freedom.  The shot at Hollywood gets even more obvious when the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.) teams up with Kim Jong Il to stop Team America, who have been savaged by the media and made to look like the bad guys.  Kim Jong Il's character is hilariously heartless and evil, and his \\"accent\\" of mispronounced L's and R's is definitely un-PC.  Otherwise, all the humor in this movie is visual, from the Team America hideout in Mount Rushmore to the sex scene that goes just a little too far.<br /><br />The ingredients for a first-class comedy were all here.  Unfortunately, they weren't tied together very well, and the movie is merely mediocre, filled with \\"drama\\" scenes that just aren't funny and a few mildly humorous songs, though blessedly fewer than in the South Park movie.  South Park fans will get a few chuckles, if they can stay awake for them.  My advice:  rent it if you really must see it.
B000069AUI|5.0|The first time I listened to this cd I was a little disappointed. I didn't hate it but it wasn't Parachutes. After listening from start to finish a few times I realized that this was better than their debut. This is a great cd to just relax and listen to. The tracks have good variety and none feel overproduced or too poppy. <br /> <br />I would also recommend seeing coldplay live. These guys are very talented and it shows live. They are not a band that only sounds good in a studio with the ability to edit.
B000002P74|5.0|SECOND HELPING, along with STREET SURVIVORS, ONE MORE FROM THE ROAD, NUTHIN' FANCY, the boxed set, THE ESSENTIAL LYNYRD SKYNYRD, GIMME BACK MY BULLETS, PRONOUNCED LEHN-NERD SKIN-NERD, the FREEBIRD movie soundtrack, ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS, GOLD & PLATINUM, and SKYNYRD'S FIRST: THE COMPLETE MUSCLE SHOALS RECORDINGS, is one of Lynyrd Skynyrd's best albums. The best song is \\"The Needle And The Spoon\\", which warns against the dangers of ANY addiction (drugs, caffeine, alcohol, food, tobacco, gambling), but there are many other great ones here, too, including \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", a top 10 single; \\"Workin' For MCA\\", which could be a protest against ALL unfair business practices; \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\", in which a guy says he just wants people to stay out of his personal life; and \\"Swamp Music\\", an extollation of music as a form of stress and anger management. The surviving members advocacies of sanctions against countries which convict foreign tourists for trumped-up crimes, capital punishment for kidnappers, increased funding for law enforcement, and major federal crackdowns on polygamy, schools and programs affiliated with Scientology (e.g. Mace-Kingsley Ranch School), and privately-run \\"boot camps\\" for troubled youth make SECOND HELPING an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
0375507256|5.0|I'm not sure where to begin talking about Cloud Atlas; my enthusiasm keeps bubbling over and upsetting everything I try to say before I can fairly begin.  I could say that it's the best novel I've read in, god, I don't even know how long, or I could talk about how important I think the book is from a creative standpoint, how it could point the way towards a new and distinct literature of the 21st century.  But that would require the marshalling of arguments and the accumulation of carefully-chosen examples, and all I really want to do is bounce on my heels excitedly and, like a nine-year-old, recount all the really cool stuff that happened - at length, and with voices and sound effects. <br />Okay.  Deep breath.  Let me see if I can get it together, here. <br />Cloud Atlas begins in 1850, with a story called \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing.\\"  Ewing, a penniless San Francisco lawyers' clerk, is returning home to his family from a business trip in Australia aboard a private schooner called the Prophetess, whose mercenary, devil-take-the-hindmost captain and crew are barely more than criminals.  As his diary begins, the ship has put in for resupply at a tiny and desolate Pacific island whose native tribe, the Moriori, has been subjugated and largely exterminated by Maori from New Zealand (who learned the gentle art of conquest from their British overlords there). <br />Detested by the ship's crew for his weak constitution and standoffish manner, the sensitive and naive Ewing befriends a shady and eccentric British physician named Henry Goose - in exile on the island for some unspecified offense - and the two men bond over chess and discussions of philosophy.  But when the Prophetess resumes its journey, Ewing discovers he has another companion - a Moriori slave who has escaped his captors and stowed away in the American's cabin, an act that could earn both of them a one-way trip overboard if discovered.  The plot develops along the familiar lines sketched in similar stories by Melville and Joseph Conrad, but then the story stops, midsentence, and we find ourselves in <br />\\"Letters from Zedelghem\\", which takes place in 1931, the dreary post-WWI Europe of Somerset Maugham and Evelyn Waugh.  Composer Robert Frobisher - young, bisexual, charismatic, and more or less utterly amoral - escapes his numerous creditors in London first by jumping out a second-story luxury hotel window, then by fleeing to the Continent and charming his way into the household of a brilliant, dying maestro.  Working as the man's amanuensis (writing sheet music from the old man's dictation) inspires Frobisher to begin his own magnum opus; he also avails himself of the remote mansion's many diversions, including the library (where he becomes fascinated by a book called \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" - unfortunately, the second half is missing) and the favors of the composer's wife and daughter.  Frobisher's escapades are wittily and unapologetically recounted by him in letters to his old lover, physics student Rupert Sixsmith - <br />- whose murder in the early 1970s is the subject of \\"Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery.\\"  This story, written in the breathless style of a Robert Ludlum thriller, follows a plucky young reporter's investigation of her friend Dr. Sixsmith's murder, which leads her (in the slightly improbable way thrillers do) to a corporate coverup involving a dangerous nuclear power plant that could irradiate the entire West Coast.  It also leads her on another, smaller quest: to find a rare recording of the beautiful \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\", composed by the obscure genius Robert Frobisher, who committed suicide in 1932.  We leave Luisa hanging from a cliff - literally - and jump into the next story. <br />And so on, and so forth.  There are three more tales - a comedy in present-day London, involving a proud and sarcastic old book publisher precipitated through a series of misadventures into a shady nursing home and the not-so-tender mercies of its staff, then a trip to 22nd-century Korea for a tour of a dystopian future society that references everything from Orwell to Bradbury to Blade Runner, and finally a glimpse of a distant postapocalyptic future, where history begins again as Stone Age tribes war for control of what was once known as Hawaii.  Each story, except the last, stops halfway through - then we read the last story in its entirety, and then plunge backwards in time, reading the second half of each of the stories in reverse order, until we end where we began: in the Pacific Ocean, with Adam Ewing - who, it turns out, is not so naive as when we and he began. <br />\\"Revolutionary or gimmicky?\\" asks Frobisher about his \\"Cloud Atlas\\" symphony, and the question could fairly be (and has been) leveled at the book itself - but as for myself, I knew which side I would take before fifty pages had passed.  The book is brilliant - or rather, not just brilliant, but incandescent.  It works on so, so many levels.  Artistically, there is absolutely no questioning Mitchell's talent.  He successfully mimics (and in many cases surpasses) any number of literary voices, from the aforementioned Melville and Somerset Maugham, to classy potboiler authors like Martin Cruz Smith and John Le Carre, to modern satirists like Philip Roth and Martin Amis, to genre sf writers like Bradbury and Heinlein and Ursula K. Le Guin. <br />But this isn't all some bloodless postmodernist Frankenstein experiment - Mitchell isn't mocking or parodying these writers, but paying them reverent homage, and finding the common threads of art and humanity that link their writing and their subject matter.  The revolutionary thing that Mitchell has done here - the floodgate he has cracked open - is to do exactly what all great novelists before him have done, namely to tell an important story with an important theme in a totally new way. <br />And it is an important theme.  It's not just that Mitchell holds our eyes open and makes us look, really look, at the innumerable and numinous connections that link us to our dimly-remembered past and our unknown future - the webs of chance and fate and coincidence that rule us all - but that he makes us see the incredible urgency of our time - and of any time.  Every story deals, to a greater or lesser degree, with war, with death, with imprisonment and escape, with coercion by violence and the exploitation of the weak by the strong, with morality versus expediency, with the politics of sex and race and class, and with our amazing capacity for both baseness and nobility.  The novel's stunning last few pages constitute a call to action not just against merely temporal and temporary enemies like the George Bushes of the world, but against the real enemy, the eternal enemy - the relentless demons of human nature that have dogged our steps from the treetops to the caves to the fields to the cities, and who now hold in their claws the buttons for Armageddon. <br />And Mitchell doesn't fall into the polemicists' trap of offering a prescription, other than, of course, the univeral one of hope and charity and conscience and energy - energy most of all.  The book left me electrified in a way I haven't felt in years.  You know how every high-schooler - well, every smart high-schooler - has that one book, that one author - be it Kerouac or Burroughs or Ayn Rand (blecch) or Sylvia Plath or Tolkien or whoever - that defined those years for them and set (to one degree or another) the course of their lives to come?  I'm sure you have a book like that - I know I do.  Well, I'm twenty-five, and Cloud Atlas made me feel that way again - and that's all I can say, really.
0440418569|5.0|I had started the first of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books when I was 12. I had heard so much about it being so good so I bought it and I started to read it. What I now find amusing is I never got any farther than the 5th chapter. I wasn't really READY for it. Not mentally. I remember reading the book thinking it made no sense and quickly losing interest. So I put the book away, totally forgot about it and read other books that I could relate to and understand. So last month, I finally picked up \\"The Golden Compass\\" again, and started to read. This time I was in a trance, I was pulled into the book and I became almost obsessed with it. The great thing about the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books is they are very logical, so it is so much easier to understand it and think about it and feel like it's REAL. The \\"His Dark Materials\\" books are definitely page-turners. After finishing the first book, I didn't have enough, I had to go right out and buy \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" I started reading \\"The Subtle Knife\\" immediately. I was more taken in by the second book more than the first and I was yearning for more the whole time. When I found the answer to one exciting event I was hurrying to find out what would happen in the next event. I wanted to read so fast so I could find out what happens and yet I read slow enough so I could take in each and every detail. So that I could better understand the story. These books are thrilling. You find yourself really loving and caring for all the main characters. You become part of their world.    Lyra is just a 12-year-old girl. She lives in a place called Jordan College in Oxford, England. But she had a fate in front of her that had long been spoken among the witches. Without knowing it, she starts the beginning of a long, painful and exciting journey. She discovers other worlds, which are so different and yet so very like her own world. She meets a boy, Will who is her age, who changes her life forever. And who's fate isconnected to her own. Lyra grows in this story from a child to a teenager. But in the end she has more wisdom than a lot of teenagers in her world do. Lyra does what is best for the future of all of existence in the end, despite how it hurts her. She does something that had never been done before, she went to the world of the dead while she was still alive. And she made it possible for all the souls in the world of the dead to be happy. I feel happy knowing the ending of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books. But at the same time I am very sad that it has ended. Because in a way I keep yearning for more and more, wishing it would never end. I would gladly read any other series by Philip Pullman if he ever made any. Because these books were BLOODY BRILLIANT! It is 11:26 P.M. right now and I stayed up late just so I could finish this book. I came immediately here after I finished to write this review. I can go to sleep happy and peaceful now. Still thinking of the ending for \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" leaves me smiling. If only there were MORE!!! The \\"His Dark Materials\\" books are easily one of the series that I will love for years and years to come.
B0008ISM40|4.0|Let's cut through all the pontification and analysis of the other reviewers here. \\"With Teeth\\" is a good album. Trent was classically trained, and it shows in the craft of his music. Few other artists can match what he has done in so few albums. \\"With Teeth\\" is more like \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" in its immediacy and commercialism. Basically, Trent does Trent. One could question why a nearly 40 year old man is still so angry and bitter about life? Especially after 16 years? Therapy? I'm waiting for Trent to grow emotionally, but in the meantime, the music is good, and that makes up for the lack of change. The album doesn't begin to lose some steam until the end. He could have left off \\"Sunspots\\", \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" and \\"Beside You In Time\\" and been no worse for wear.<br /><br />The Dual Disc format is excellent. There's nothing like hearing all the details of each song in 5.1 surround sound. The the other extras on the dvd are paltry, and I think Bruce Springsteen put the format to better use on his latest. The video for \\"That Hand That Feeds\\" is mildly amusing, but it doesn't come close to \\"Closer\\".<br /><br />Verdict: Nine Inch Nails fans should be happy, and I don't understand all these complaints from other reviewers here. How could you not like \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"With Teeth\\", \\"Love Is Not Enough\\", \\"Only\\", \\"Getting Smaller\\" and \\"You Know What You Are?\\"
B00026WU7I|5.0|BLOOD ON THE TRACKS is, arguably, Dylan's finest album. A collection of songs written in a few fevered weeks in the mid-1970s as Dylan's marriage to Sara Lowndes failed, this album manages to be introspective and confessional without being either hyperbiographical, cloying, tortured, or more importantly, torturing. Leave that to the follow-up, DESIRE.<br /><br />Dylan has managed here to resurrect the spirit of Woody Guthrie as he wanders musically across the immeasurable distances of an American landscape of broken dreams and incalcuable promise. The sounds of diesel and steam locomotives shunting, sad whistles blowing, and boxcars clacking over rails in the night is never far from the listener's consciousness, though the songs are rarely so pointed.<br /><br />And some of the songs are iconic. The odyssey of \\"Idiot Wind,\\" (a Seventies version of \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\") is imbued with a kind of sneering disdain of self and other: \\"We are idiots babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.\\"<br /><br />Dylan's wonderful opening line, \\"Someone's got it in for me; they're planting stories in the press\\" sounds like a tale of snakes in the grass, and the verse that follows is instantly recognizable, and has been transmuted into other artists' songs, the sincerest form of flattery.<br /><br />The same is true for \\"Tangled Up in Blue,\\" the best song on this album of gifted songwriting. Once again, Dylan takes us on a journey of the inner landscape, describing in clear, clean penstrokes the twisted symbiosis between THIS man and THIS woman who somehow happen to be us.<br /><br />\\"You're a Big Girl Now,\\" \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" \\"Meet Me In The Morning,\\" \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" and \\"Buckets of Rain\\" are stylistically and thematically linked, five simply chorded, brief and incisive takes on the pain and joy of love. Each is unique; yet, in each, the loved one is moving away; in each, the singer is forced to recognize her growth; and in each there is hope for a future.<br /><br />\\"If You See Her Say Hello\\" is the resolution of this sextet of songs. The mysterious \\"She\\" has moved on, and Dylan summons a rare kind of respect tinged with nostalgia that makes the listener wish he knew the \\"Her\\" and was the \\"Him\\" this lovely, heartfelt tone poem has given birth to.<br /><br />\\"Shelter From The Storm\\" is yet another \\"She\\" and \\"I\\" song, this time founded in a Christian metaphor (it is an obvious precursor to Dylan's \\"religious\\" phase which followed in the early Eighties). If he could have kept on in this vein even \\"Serve Somebody\\" would have been tolerable.<br /><br />Unselfconscious and never hortatory, \\"Shelter From The Storm\\" transmutes Jesus and Mary Magdalen from remote Biblical characters into two patrons of a greasy spoon diner. If Jesus had owned a banjo and smoked filterless Camels, he would have taught this song to Dylan. Inspired songwriting.<br /><br />\\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" seems out of place, though it's not, on the album of introspective, gentle, and sometimes tearing tunes. Dylan has given us a rollicking nine minute Western horse opera, the equivalent of a musical \\"High Noon.\\" It's a pity someone never turned this incredible song into something else, though they'd be hard-pressed to match Dylan's vision.<br /><br />Is BLOOD ON THE TRACKS autobiographical? Yes, in the sense that all great art comes from the Self. It's Dylan's amazing capacity on this album to break down the wall between performer and audience that turns BLOOD ON THE TRACKS into something beyond \\"My Journal.\\" Its a journey---for whoever listens.there is hope for a future. <br /> <br />\\"If You See Her Say Hello\\" is the resolution of this sextet of songs.

B0006284JQ|5.0|This album contains plenty of fine pop songs. While Britney isn't the worlds best singer she has a voice good enough for these songs and what good songs indeed! \\"Toxic\\" is a good lyrical song. About a relationship and how you love your partner. Anyone one who's veer loved someone will relate to that. \\"Baby, One more time\\" (her 1st hit) again deals with that universal topic. \\"Lucky\\" a song about someone seemingly having it all, but doesn't feel loved, again a story many can relate to at some time in their life. These songs are trashed by many unfairly, yet, they deal with real life. Something \\"serious\\" rock bands wouldn't know if it came up and hit them in the face. <br /> <br />This album collects many hit singles, but the studio albums also contain some fine moments that were just as strong as the singles but never made it beyond an album cut. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

B0000C8AV2|5.0|I bought this record when it first came out, and always liked it.  Then it sat for years with only occasional play as my LPs were relegated to second class citizens while CDs became the preferred format.  In reading Dylan's \\"Chronicles 1\\" recently, he goes into great detail about how this album was recorded.  The way he tells it, he was just about creatively bankrupt, and struggled greatly with the songs that would ultimately form this record.  In the book, he also describes the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes of New Orleans. Dylan wrestled with Daniel Lanois on the direction of the sound, but once they were finished, he says Lanois was the one who shaped it into what it is now, and Dylan seems to be very pleased with the result. Maybe \\"The man in the long black coat\\" best captures the mood: Crickets are chirpin', the water is high/ <br />There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin'dry/ <br />Window wide open, African trees/ <br />Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze <br />As the amazon review says above, this is truly his best after \\"Infidels\\", and without a doubt, one of his best, period. The SACD/enhanced version gives it an even deeper dimension.
B000063K2W|1.0|First of all, I'm a \\"chick.\\"  Second, I love classic old films.  Third, I like George Cukor.  Fourth, the cast of this film was fabulous.  But the plot and characters were INSUFFERABLE!  I agree with the reviewer that said this film is incredibly misogynistic!  The women are all catty, shallow, heartless bitches -- except Norma Shearer's character, who is a total sap.  Much of the dialogue is so rapid-fire and rat-a-tat-tat that you can barely understand what they're saying.  The fashion-show scene was way too long, as was the film as a whole, and I especially hated the ultra-schmaltzy scenes between Shearer and her totally implausible, girl-scouty daughter.  My husband is generally OK with chick flicks, but I thought he was a saint for sitting through this one.
B0000019PA|5.0|Neutral Milk Hotel's sophomore effort \\"In the Airplane Over the Sea\\" is a distinctly unique album that should both surprise and entertain its listener. It's somewhat abstract, and ambitious, but not overly challenging, so it should prove easily assessable to an open-minded listener.<br /><br />\\"In the Airplane over the Sea\\" has ten tracks, but as concept albums go, it is best listened to as a whole. Each song flows effortlessly into the next, to create a coherent whole, sort of like the second side of the Beatles \\"Abby Road.\\"<br /><br />\\"In the Airplane over the Sea\\" jumps back and forth from acoustic numbers, to garage rock, to full marching band arraignments-complete with trumpets, organs, a trombone, a saxophone, and various other instruments. While this ambitious arraignment may have easily produced a disjointed sounding album, that would fall under its own weight, Neutral Milk Hotel pulls it off with surprising ease. The acoustic numbers are simple and straightforward, yet interesting and well-written. The full-band numbers sound sort of like Mudhoney meets a marching band. While the band and its guest musicians are not technically brilliant, they sound tight and invigorated. The offbeat eclectic nature of the album should keep the listener interested and always guessing what will happen next, even if you have heard it multiple times before.<br /><br />Guitarist/songwriter Jeff Mangum should be credited for his vision, craftsmanship, and successful merging of orchestration, garage rock, and acoustic numbers.<br /><br />The lyrics are equally abstract. They sound like fragments of thoughts, scattered about, like bedroom poetry-yet they never sound pretentious or overly abstract. Even if you don't know exactly what they mean, you'll get the gist of what was said.<br /><br />This album could be appreciated as background music, or with concentrated listening-because there is a lot going on, and you'll probably pick up things that you didn't get the first time around.
B00080Z53O|5.0|This movie absolutely blew us away.  Lyrical, powerful, beautiful... I'm speechless!  As much as I loved \\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" \\"The Sea Inside\\" was even better.  So now I want to see everything Javier Bardem has ever done.  \\"Before Night Falls\\" is OK, but not as good as \\"Sea.\\"
B000002A33|3.0|The Screaming Trees were a great band that combined psychedlia, punk rock and roots rock.  And Mark Lanegan was one of the strongest frontment of that Seattle crop.  In 1996, they were no longer constrained by the expectations of the waning grunge revolution.  So I think they were really in a position to try something different and release their magnum opus.  Instead, Dust has 10 catchy, well written rock songs, all of which would've been perfectly at home on \\"Sweet Oblivion\\".  So, basically, while Lanegan et al were wasting their time with drugs and alcohol, their fans waited four years to get forty minutes of the same old same old.  The Trees received little recognition for this effort, and probably got what they deserved.  Still, I like the band overall, and would recommend the Anthology from their SST years (or, for that matter, the compilation from their last three albums \\"Ocean of Confusion\\", which is a better value than buying all of these good-but-not-great albums individually).    ADDENDUM: 3 months later, this album has found its back into heavy rotation on my CD player.  I must admit that the songcraft is excellent;  and this album must be judged a success in relation to its ambitions--although I remain disappointed that those ambitions were not nearly as lofty as the hyperbole of many of this album's boosters would have you believe.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I'm so sick of bands using their musical status and talents to push political agendas. I used to really like these guys and put up with some of the messages because the music was sick but this album reaches a new low. The music is decent but I can only listen to someone trash my country while they make millions here for so long. I'm sure it will sell millions of copies to the sheeple in our evil capitalist nation and I'm so glad that our troops can have such an inspirational album front and center while they fight the real evil. Good morale for America, but wait where is the song that condemns the terrorists and suicide bombers, I guess that was a hidden track... maybe check a country album for that one.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|I was wondering why this CD was on Sale for $8.99 at my local Circuit City. 3 solid tracks (Serj saves the day). 8 others to fall asleep to. Daron's vocals are so bad that even studio gods Rick Rubin and Andy Wallace could not save this ship from sinking. I would give this CD four stars if there were no vocals. Seriously folks. If you want to hear someone being castrated. This is the CD for you.  <br /> <br />
B000067J1Y|5.0|Topper Harley: That is the whitest white part of the eye I've ever seen. Do you floss?  Ramada Thompson \\"It's Vicks, I have a cold. <br /> <br />Hot Shots is a classic. Yes it came out in '91, but there hasn't been a movie out like it since. It takes a bit after the likes of the Naked Gun in terms of \\"dry humor\\" and many may not really understand why people laugh. But people with a sense of humor will choke on their popcorn.  From the makers of the unforgettable \\"Airplane\\" you know what to expect. The main character of course is Topper Harley,(Charlie Sheen) a perfect parody of Maverick from Top Gun, but the star of this movie is clearly Lloyd Bridges who made me laugh a gizillion times throughout the flick. Seeing him respond to a strategic attack on the enemy with a response of \\"I don't have a clue what you're talking about, not a ******* clue\\" will make some wet their pants ! Cary Elwes (Men in Tights, The Crush) is a great character for the movie too and has some of best comedic lines in movie history. <br /> <br />For those of you who don't appreicate stupid crazy comedies like Airplane, Men In Tights, Naked Gun, and of course Hot Shots 1 and 2, you need to open up and smile. Laughter is really good medicine, and we all could use a laugh with movies like this one!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie is a totally disgusting waste of time and talent. It's bad enough to finish Mike Nichols illustrious career. The actors should be ashamed to have wasted their time in this clueless, plotless piece of trash.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Daron! Stick to playing guitar!We don't need two vocalists in this band,Serj can handle the job just fine.OK then to the cd itself,it rocks.It is a little short but I guess the rest comes later? Is this a new trend?I believe Limp Bizkit is doing the same thing.Lotsa flak over all the political overtones on here.Bands have been doing that since the beginning of time!So I don't get my panties in a bind over that.I just try to listen to the songs and enjoy them.But this is a worthy purchase to add to your SOAD collection.
B000002KKS|5.0|Heaven and Hell (1980.), Black Sabbath's ninth studio album<br /><br />'Heaven and Hell', Black Sabbath's ninth studio album, released in 1980 was the album which saw the godfathers of heavy metal come back to greatness. The release of this album ushered a new era for Black Sabbath, chiefly because it was the first album not to feature vocal legend Ozzy Osbourne, who had been chucked out of the band due to his drug and alcohol addiction a year or so before this album's release. So, you say to yourself that surely Sabbath will never be the same again without Ozzy, however this couldn't be further from the truth. The replacement vocalist was none other than Ronnie James Dio, one of the great voices of metal, who had previously left Rainbow and had years and years of experience behind him. So therefore, with the recruitment of Dio himself, Black Sabbath were ready to rock n' roll again in perhaps a bigger and more powerful way than before!<br /><br />'Heaven and Hell' is one hell of record FULL STOP. To label this album just a masterpiece is an understatement in itself. This is in my opinion one of Black Sabbath's best albums, if not the best (I've not personally heard all of their albums so I'll not make a full judgment on that). The album is heavy metal at its ravaging best - Black Sabbath's sound has certainly moved with the times and has quite an 80's metal sound to it, not that there's anything wrong in that! Ronnie James Dio himself perhaps gives the album the edge over a lot of Black Sabbath's other works, he is, in my opinion, and I know some will disagree with me, slightly better than Ozzy and that's saying something because Ozzy's a true great vocalist. Dio's singing has power and technical perfection, plus his dungeons and dragons lyrics fit in very well with Sabbath's style. Toni Iommi's plays some of his best stuff on the guitar on this album, jamming out plenty of great solos and some memorable, racing riffs. Individuals aside, the band overall were a rejuvenated force after an uncertain period in the band's career. This album deservedly gained the band a new generation following, even if some hard core Black Sabbath fans hated it. It sold deservedly well, maybe not well enough in my opinion and is perhaps underrated when you consider it against the popularity of 'Paranoid'. The most up to date version of this album is the Warner Brothers remaster - the sound quality is great however I think there is a missed opprtuinity for the addition of bonus tracks here which would make the reissue a better bargain.<br /><br />The album itself kicks off with a real monster track in 'Neon Knights' a fast paced track with a classic metal riff. The follow up, 'Children of the Sea' is one of the strongest tracks on the album and definitely one of the best performances from Dio on the album, with his mystical lyrics. The song has a clever integration of both quiet acoustic sounding sections and some heavy choruses, building up to a climax with Dio howling 'Look Out! The Sun is going black!' 'Lady Evil' is another mystically styled track with a theatrical style and some snarling guitar work. 'Heaven and Hell' is the peak of this great album, a seven minute masterpiece - Iommi's guitar play is amazing and Geezer Butler's steady, strong uncompromising bass line make this track as close to perfection as you can get in rock song, and I haven't even mentioned Dio's vocals on this track! 'Wishing Well' is another excellent song, upbeat and fast - Dio's singing and Iommi's guitar play blend perfectly again on this track. 'Die Young' has a slow, mysterious start which turns into another classic heavy rocker. 'Walk Away' is a great follow up before the final track, 'Lonely Is The Word' a track which is so, so underrated. A great closing song, Dio puts in another piece of vocal mastery and there's some more mean guitar work from Iommi.<br /><br />.....AMAZING. 'Heaven and Hell' is an undisputed masterpiece which perhaps does not get the creditit rightfully deserves. This is one great metal album - Black Sabbath brought themselves back to their rightful greatness in 1980 with perhaps their greatest line up, with Dio at the helm. This is perhaps the band at their greatest peak - an album not to be overlooked. Any fan of metal would be crazy not to get this album.one great metal album - Black Sabbath brought themselves back to their rightful greatness in 1980 with perhaps their greatest line up, with Dio at the helm.

B000929AJQ|3.0|I waited patiently,and kinda feel let down.THe cd isn't bad,but it isn't great either.And I am a long time fan.I can't quite put my finger on what isn't right,could be it's more stripped down.The songwriting is superb as always.Could be I just got spoiled by the fragile.But needless to say it's worth getting,I'm sure in time it will grow on me.
B0000028UK|5.0|Its because Vedder and company made one of the best follow-up albums in the history of rock n' roll. Just LISTEN to \\"elderly woman behind the counter\\" a truly awesome all acoustic jam with Vedder proclaiming \\"hearts and thoughts they fade...fade away\\" as the song comes to a close, truly awe-inspiring.
015670160X|4.0|This is a comic \\"biography\\" about Orlando, who starts off the book as a 16 year old boy in the Elizabethan era, and ends the books as a 36 year old woman in 1928.  Oddly, Orlando's long lifespan doesn't seem to stike other characters in the book as unusual, although his/her sex change does come into question (although most people just matter of factly accept it).  This is an interesting book that allows Virginia Woolf to make witty observations about English society and the differences between men and women.
B000001DWG|5.0|This album was reissued in 1992 with bonus tracks and they are worth every second, this album IS Apple with the bonus tracks, all of which are excellent, Andy Wood should have lived on and created more awesome albums. Wood, Gossard, Fairweather, Ament and Gilmore created moving and touching ballads as well as just some kick ass jams such as, This is Shangri-La and Come Bite The Apple. buy it together with Apple. MLB 4 EVER!!!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|What an amazing album this is. On this CD System of a Down somehow manages to be even more creative, diverse, powerful, poignant, and of course, crazy. I wouldn't call all of the songs catchy, but you can pick up on them within a few listens. B.Y.O.B. is a fine representation of the entire album with the heavy guitar, eastern influence, and the hook. It's very impressive how S.O.A.D. manages to combine so many styles, many of which contradict each other, and make an album as fine as this, perhaps that is why amazon.com compared S.O.A.D. to someone as obscure as Gilbert and Sullivan, because no one else makes music like these guys.  <br /> <br />Although this creativity is why I listen to music, it apparently turns a lot of people off. If you look at all the 1 star reviews you will find one or two line reviews containing such brilliant and original descriptions such as, \\"it sucks,\\" \\"don't buy it,\\" and \\"stop doing politics\\" which should tell you how great this album really is if all the idiots hate it. But seriously, there are a couple of legit drawbacks to this album. One, it is only 36min. long, but that is only because it is only half of the album, the other half comes out in November. Two, is the increased vocals of the guitar player who probably sings lead on close to half the album. Daron did write all of the music, most of the lyrics, co produced the album, and actually has a good voice, but Serj's weird voice is the trademark of System and the more Daron sings, the less Serj does. At least two lead singers make the album even more diverse, as if it needed it.  <br /> <br />If B.Y.O.B. isn't enough to make you buy the album than I would give Radio/Video, Lost in Hollywood, Question! and Violent Pornography a try.  <br />
B000669GAI|5.0|Its Pearl Jam's best songs on two CD's...why would you not want it?
B00003CX5P|3.0|Hopefully those of you have enjoyed my reviews of various cds and the Invader Zim volumes will be drawn to this six part review of probably the greatest story ever placed on the big screen. In 1999 we Star Wars fans were finally brought to the very beginning of the grand story that George Lucas created almost 30 years ago. We were given the origins of the true main character Anakin Skywalker, the profited chosen one the Jedi said would bring balance to the Force and destroy the dark side once and for all. It is not the best piece of the story, but not being one of those truly obsessed fans one has to realize that in a grand tale you always have to begin somewhere and an introduction will be a bit dull and a bit boring because it is not going to give the watcher what he or she wants. That piece is the climax to this story, which would not be seen until 2005.<br /><br />All and all the movie is fun to watch. The characters are well put together, even though the dialogue is a bit gut wrenching, but hey Lucas was never one to focus on characters. The casting for all the roles were very well chosen and yes I am a supporter of Jar Jar Binks. Although many obsesses will wish for his death he is an essential part to the story and that is revealed in the end of this film where two races of one planet unite to oppose a threat.<br /><br />I feel that Lucas did a great job beginning his space epic and putting all the characters into place so that they will end up where they should be in the very last chapter of the saga. 'The Phantom Menace' is fun to watch the characters are surely memorable and let's face it.... the Pod Race was pretty cool. I give this film 3 stars just based on the fact that this is just a huge tease for what is yet to come and that even though there is no sign of Anakin linked to Darth Vader as of yet its still great to see that he was born into that galaxy far far away as an innocent boy not knowing where his adventures would take him. That is what made the fans keep coming back for more.coming back for more.
B0000027RL|5.0|And yes you read that correctly, NOT Nevermind, which certainly has its place in music history but not nearly as good as Ten. But as far as debuts go, perhaps one of the best ever. Right up there with Appetite For Destruction and Definatley Maybe. Eddie Vedder captivates right from the beginning with his dark often brooding lyrics with a voice that could NEVER be duplicated no matter how many people try to copy it(Scott Stapp, i'm looking at you) but for me, the best song on this album is hands down \\"Alive\\", truly a piece of rock n' roll greatness with Vedder growling more passionate than ever, with incredible lyrics to boot \\"Son ohh she said, have i got a little story for you, what you thought was your daddy, was nothing but a...while you were sitting home alone at age 13, your real daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him, but i'm glad we talked\\" truly amazing with an excellent chorus. Best CD of 1991, a must own.

B000002GJH|5.0|Chris Cornell never sounded better here than he does in a one time tribute band to deceased songwriter/poet Andrew Wood of Mother Love Bone, another band that was tragically cut short due to Wood's overdose. i simply love the way Stone Gossard quoted the album \\"just music to make music...life rules\\" just a great attitude that is rare to find in today's bloated pop-punk, nu metal, teen queen nonsense. With this CD being thrown together so quickly, its downright frightening to consider what this band could have done had they experimented and stayed together, but none the less, we have this and Temple Of The Dog is an INCREDIBLE album, just listen to Times Of Trouble and you'll know what i mean.
B0007GADZO|5.0|Every release from Steve is a wide sampling of moods and technique.    If you've enjoyed his previous work, then you can't miss here either.  It's stunning in the way that Steve Vai is ALWAYS stunning.  He doesn't just hit a note, he brings that note out of his instrument in exactly the manner he chooses.  I don't think that any other guitar player I've ever heard has that command over their instrument.  <br /> <br />It's true, he's still singing here and there, but not that much.  I've gotta say, if he wants to sing occassionaly, fine... as long as he keeps playing in such an inspiring manner.   <br /> <br />I read a few reviews that critiqued the sound quality.  I found it to be warm enough.  For (mostly) instrumental guitar music you could do alot worse in the sound quality area. <br /> <br />There are a few tracks that don't grab me much.  I'm not too interested in the big rock n roll sounding songs.  My favorite works are the songs where you hear the lead on one track, where there's a feeling of intimacy and you can hear his fingers on the strings.  You can sit back and think \\"my god, he's really playing that!\\"  Those songs are here too.  <br /> <br />If it's too \\"weird\\" for you,  well... Most folks who love this music play an instrument and the weird becomes interesting when you look deeper.  There's plenty of mindless fluffy pop in the world, thank god there's a little weird stuff too!
B0000028M7|5.0|The day Dirt and Core by Stone Temple Pilots was released, both picked up by me that day and both albums still rock on to this day, but back to Dirt. What else can be said, Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell were two of the best songwriters to come out of the 90's and its none more apparent then on Dirt. Each song almost feels like a tale of Layne's mind as he coped with heroin addiction, which would sadly cost him his life a decade later. You get a real sense of geniune, thought provoking lyrics with Staleys tortured yell and Jerry Cantrells ever rocking guitar. An absolute must for any fan of AIC or just good music in general
B000929AJQ|3.0|I'm an old NIN fan.  I had PHM before anyone else I knew... blah blah.  I really loved Trent's work because it stood out.  It was absolutely groundbreaking and creative.  Then The Fragile came out and I listened to it several times, but came away with nothing.  There's nothing on The Fragile I found very memorable and there's just nothing here very memorable either. <br /> <br />I wanted to love it.  I wanted songs that reminded me of the second half of Perfect Drug... Intense, original, chilling!!  Just didn't happen.  I still think it's better than alot of music coming out these days, hence 3 stars, but I was hoping for something else. <br /> <br />I want Metallica to fire Bob Rock and let Trent produce them.  I think THAT would be interesting!
B000021XR5|5.0|This album got so much negative publicity and i can't for the life of me figure out why. This album is great packed hard fast paced rockers such as Sex and Violence to moving ballads such as Atlanta, Glide and the best song of 1999, Sour Girl. everybody complained it \\"wasn't the same STP anymore\\" well duh, its called PROGRESSING, trying new things and experimenting with different sounds which is always something i admired about the Pilots, no two albums sound alike, its a different showing each time out and No. 4 is fantastic, so don't dismiss it on Weiland's drug problems because thats just a cop-out.
068987474X|5.0|I think this has to be the best book ever written.  It is so true and teaches all women, single or married, what to look for and signs to pick up on that show \\"hey, he's just not that into you.\\"  A must read for every woman.  This book covers every topic possible and almost every excuse that a man could give to you and how to handle it.  There is even a checklist at the end of each chapter to cover what you should have learned.  Again, this book is worth the cost....well worth the cost!!!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Nothing like their 1992 release with Core but equally as good, the distorted riffs are toned down on this album and Weiland sings in a totally different style, a true testiment to his abilities as a vocalist, often agreed by many to be their best album, Purple is an alt-rock classic and one of the most creative records of the 90's, songs like Vasoline and the always amazing Interstate Love Song, which everyone likes, fan of the group or not remain radio staples today, even the lesser known songs easily could have been singles. How the beautiful \\"Still Remains\\" never became a single will continue to baffle me
B000002U82|3.0|So here I go. While good this is a very overplayed album for the most part. I've been listening to it since I was 13, and to be honest I've grown tired of most of the songs with the exception of one, and that's \\"Us And Them\\". Why haven't I grown tired of hearing this song? Well I guess it has something to do with what it does to me, and that's get me aroused. The first time I heard this song was Memorial Day weekend, 1981, and it was a Saturday night at 10:00, and I was out riding my bike, and brother let me tell you something I was getting all kinds of ideas with that song playing. I was half-tempted to ride home, and let my parents know I wanted to ride down to the fish hatcheries area of the Deleware River. There's this girl there who was 14, and I would've wanted to ask her if she wanted to walk along the riverside at night, but my father was on last out, and had to work midnight to eight in the morning, and even if he hadn't had to work I'm sure that there was no way at that late hour they would let me ride that far. Why am I writing this now almost 24 years later? Well I guess I'm trying to release this from my soul, because if I had that chance to ride down there, and she went walking with me I would've told her how I felt about her. You see she only saw one side of me, and that one was an aggressive sore loser, and she as far as I know doesn't know how I really felt about her. Pat if you're out there I wanted to let you know that I really liked you, and wanted to take a walk with you along the river that night. This is Dan. Anyway, I wanted to finally release that as it's been sitting inside of me for all this time about as long as the album stayed on the Billboard 200 album charts.
B00003CXBK|2.0|The movie itself was okay. I have no problems with the plot line, story, characters, or animation. Although I'd have to say I don't agree with people that say this is Hayao Miyazaki's best work, and I've seen every one of his movies except Nausicaa. I think the gore, violence, and blood make this movie pretty disturbing and I think the world of movies should make a rating in between PG-13 and R and put Princess Mononoke in that catagory. I'm 13 and wasn't too impressed. I have some friends who are 13 and would find this movie VERY disturbing. It's not bad enough for R but I think you should be cautious with teens under 15. Now don't get me wrong, it WAS a good movie, and I LOVE anime, but I just had a little trouble getting past the gore and blood. This is one of those movies that has potential but it just didn't quite get there. Oh, and did I mention how incredibly LONG it was? I mean after the first half I started yelling at the TV \\"Get on with it already! We get the point now let's add some PLOT and move FORWARD!!!\\" Truely, it get monotonous. <br /> <br />Okay, enough of my rants. Overall it was an okay movie. Not recomended for younger kids/teens. And if you want to watch a wholesome Hayao Miyazaki movie with the family, go for Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, and Spirited Away.
B000002HRE|5.0|Forget about what all the Cyber based Upset Napster geeks have to say about Metallica and listen to this badass album for your self.  It is awesome.  The first four songs are unstoppable.  Pure Metallica.  Cant get enough of the entire Met catalog.  Metal Up Your Ass!!!!!!!!
B0001L3LUE|2.0|Man, I can't believe all these positive reviews. To call this documentary a masterpiece is insulting to any intelligent human being. It's like saying \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" is the greatest sci-fi film ever made! Throughout this film, many images are shown for barely a split second, one right after another in quick succession. Is this crap what they call \\"artistic\\"?!? I had to take Aspirin pills for God's sake! Anyway, the only truly compelling thing about this documentary is the original recordings of conversations between McNamara and Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Otherwise, I was either totally bored by the sluggish pace or annoyed by the so-called \\"artistic\\" filming technique. And speaking of McNamara, calling him a \\"war criminal\\" is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Did he make some bad choices? Yes. Do his lessons make any sense? No. But at least in my opinion bombing Vietnamese terrorists is nothing compared to what went on in 1930's and 1940's Germany. The very fact that this film won an oscar is only further proof that the Academy Awards is filled with complete morons. My advice is to stay clear of this snoozefest and look elsewhere for a compelling documentary about Cold War politics.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I agree totally with the review above- Im losing interest FAST- so fat that i dont listen to then anymore- bye bye DT
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If this film were to be given one millionth the pre publicity that the \\"Star Wars\\" films get, it would probably have been a box office triumph.  It is flawless!  The film opened with NO advance publicity.   I think the producers thought the film would sell itself.  It did, but not to the momentum needed to recoup its 90 million dollar investement.  How shocking that a crude, toilet humor film like \\"Meet the Fockers\\" could earn a quarter of a billion dollars shows what type of world we live in. <br />If I see one more review on this version of Phantom that mentions M. Crawford and S. Brightman, I will scream.  Why is it always the original interpretations are the best?  If Phyllys Diller and Bob Hope had been the originals, would they be wanted for the film?  Give me a break.  Sarah Brightman's casting in the play was nepotism, period!  She stank!!!!! Crawford was fine but the dozens after him were as good if not better!  The stage musical is all spectacle and no emotion.  The film makes you feel for the characters.  Every frame is a work of art.  Emma Rossum is stunning.   Gerald Butler reaks of sexuality and is a fine actor.  Whatever happend to just being entertained at the movies?  Do we have to have the \\"f\\" word in every other phrase of dialogue and sex and violence? To quote one reviewer: this film is a breath of fresh air.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Overall, this was a really solid album for only being 36 minutes.  Here's a breakdown for those that haven't bought the CD yet. <br /> <br />Soldier Side: 3.5/5 Good but would have been better as a whole song rather than just an intro.  Very melodic and dreary. <br /> <br />BYOB: 5/5 Great song and first single.  Awesome chorus. <br /> <br />Revenga: 5/5 My personal favorite. It flows really well and is really fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Cigaro: 4.5/5 Another good song but can get a little annoying after awhile.  <br /> <br />Radio/Video: 4/5 Great harmonizing and has a fun, polka feel. <br /> <br />This Cocaine: 4/5 \\"F The System 2\\"  <br /> <br />Violent Pornography: 3.5/5 Good but parts of it get annoying after awhile.  The chorus makes up for the rest of the song. <br /> <br />Question!: 5/5 Great song.  It has great harmonies and transistions between soft and heavy seemlessly. <br /> <br />Sad Statue: 5/5 Another great rock song.  It grows on you. <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood: 4/5 Good synth, but the lyrics are a little too silly.  Songs about Tony Danza are great but come on guys. haha. <br /> <br />Lost In Hollywood: 5/5 Great closer.  It ends the CD on a high note. <br /> <br />You can really see System maturing with this album.  Although it is short, it makes up for it with great songs.  There isn't one bad song on this.  I can't wait for the second one.
B0002X314C|1.0|The only thing that was lifted was this damn CD out of my player. All the hype about John Legend was a waste of pure time. I mean don't get me wrong, Kanye did an excellent job producing (as usual) but this time with the wrong person. Honestly, he has no voice, and the lyrics are whack. If a person feels the need to hear good music of the sort, spend a few dimes on Anthony Hamilton's CD \\"Comin From Where I'm From\\". Now this is a genuine piece of art, but once again in the music game it's who you know and not what you do.
B0000073BG|5.0|Sadly CDs are convenient but do not come close to the sonic capabilities of vinyl (LPs).  Import CD or not, the real \\"test\\" of any listening system is with vinyl playback. This album is no different than many others in this respect. The original USA LP release of this LP was on \\"SIRE\\" records an import division of ABC Records. Sadly these LPs were for \\"mass listening\\" on \\"Mid-Fi\\" sound systems during the mid-70's (i.e. direct drive turntables with Audio-Technica cartridges and a pair of \\"decent\\" bookshelf speakers (Dyna, ADVENT, IMF, B-A, or ADC) and lacked the ability to convey what is REALLY in the ANALOG, multi-track Master tapes. <br /> <br />Brad Miller issued the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs (MFSL) pressing version of this album (MFSL-1-099) in 1982 in which he re-mastered the album from the multi-track Master Tapes. These LPs are highly sought after even today.  Also, the original U.K. release on the BTM label is far superior to the \\"Sire\\" US pressings. This is mostly due to the use of original master tapes (not dubs), better cutting lathes, and better, thicker vinyl.  A \\"MoFi\\" (MFSL) CD (a.k.a \\"GOLD CD\\") of this album \\"may\\" exist - but I have never personally seen one.  If it does, it is worth owning!  Especially if you are a \\"non-vinyl\\" person (\\"Dude, I threw all of that Dinosaur turntable stuff away ages ago!\\"). <br /> <br />Now, you either LOVE Annie Haslam's etheral, mystifying 5 octave range, sexy, siren-like, soprano voice or you do not.  It's a lot like Jimi, either it is just \\"noise\\" to you or you \\"get it\\" and want more, more, more! In the 70's I (the sound you hear is the \\"Geezer Alarm\\" going off!) had a High School friend (Steve Kunder) that LOVED this band and saw all of their concerts whereas I \\"kinda liked them\\" but was more into \\"Guitar Heroes\\" like Jimi, Ritchie, Robin, Eric, Jeff and Jimmy P.. But even back then the \\"Classical Progressive Rock\\" bug had bitten me with ELP, King Crimson and Renaissance.  Fortunately for me Steve had at least \\"exposed\\" me to Annie Haslam's captivating voice on something other than a Philly radio station broadcast and that sound stuck with me for a VERY long time. <br /> <br />Enough bloviating... This album is often considered \\"less\\" than \\"Turn of the Cards\\" and \\"Ashes are Burning\\" but the truth is that it was recorded better and Mastered better than any of the band's previous work.  Especially the MFSL version compared to the \\"Yucky\\" USA SIRE pressing version.  By 1975 the Band had become extremely popular - especially in Philly & N.Y.- and was doing MAJOR touring performances both in the USA (East Coast) and in the UK with an orchestra.  So this album was the culmination of all this further \\"progression\\" into longer songs with orchestral accompaniment. <br /> <br />Sadly, MFSL (\\"MoFi\\") only did this album and no other albums by Renaissance. The next Renaissance studio album after this one did not do as well and was followed by the heralding in of the \\"Disco Era\\" which pretty much left the band struggling for all but the \\"die hard\\" fan audiences. <br /> <br />Bottom line: GREAT LP - even if this \\"Import CD\\" version is the best that you can do - especially if you want to hear ASTOUNDING soprano vocals WITHOUT all of the digital processing and \\"gimmicks\\" used today.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|When i first got the CD, i did the one through just to get a feel for the album, and i did not think it was that great. But once i really sat down and listened, this album is really really good. My favorite tracks are 3,5 and 7.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Saw is really the scariest movie of the year. i personally think it's really smart and original, and the special effects are awesome! But, actually, I do have one complain about it: I think it's very strong, and some scenes it has are very strong and I think they could disturb some people's minds...<br /><br />However, why doesn't it include deleted scenes? I read some time ago that it was censored and some scenes had been cut of the theatrical release, so I thought the DVD would include those scenes, but it doesn't :( That dissapointed me a little
B00005JKNF|5.0|A weekend in a fabulous mansion of the countryside between blue-blood aristocrats and a murder is the perfect excuse to reunite to one of the most talented groups of British actors in the new film of Robert Altman, Gosford Park.<br /><br />In this acute social satire, the veteran director presents/displays the exaggerated pretentiousness of the English high class and the relations between masters and servants, outlining clearly the values and opposed attitudes of each class.<br /><br />Completely narrated from the point of view of the servants, Gosford Park is an acute observation of the division of classes that characterized England in the thirties.<br /><br />In 1932, Gosford Park is the magnificent house of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, the glamorous Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas). To a weekend celebration that includes hunting and abundant banquets attend a spoiled countess (Maggie Smith), a movie producer (Bob Balaban), a matinee idol (Jeremy Northam) and the sisters of Lady Sylvia.<br /><br />Under the sumptuous rooms of the rich, the austere floors of the help contain a group so impressive as the one above, which includes Jennings, the main butler (Alan Bats), Sir William's valet (Sir Derek Jacobi) and the other help members who come with their masters, from the suspect Harry Denton (Ryan Phillipe) to the ingenuous Mary (Kelly MacDonald). All the personnel are supervised by Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the cook (Eileen Atkins) and Elsie (Emily Watson).<br /><br />The story goes on between the financial and sexual goings and comings of the masters and their servants. Plots and subplots are mere instruments so these characters receive their dose of scandal, gadgets, rumors, treason, sexual tension and murder.<br /><br />Altman, specialist in films with long casts, demonstrates that he hasn't lost his spark and playfulness. For each laughter and playful moment, there's a dark and surprise turn. Gosford Park is so jammed of guests and servants, that the disappearance of a knife goes unnoticed, until it appears in the chest of one of the main characters.<br /><br />But to explore the criminal genre is clearly not Altman's intention; rather it is to make fun of it. The clues are so obvious and the clumsy detective (Stephen Fry) is so obtuse that he destroys more evidence than the ones he collects. As to be expected, there's more than one suspect, and no character is 100% innocent. Not the one upstairs and much less those downstairs. Everybody is guilty, because everybody has a secret.of guests and servants, that the disappearance of a knife goes unnoticed, until it appears in the chest of one of the main characters.  <br /> <br />But to explore the criminal genre is clearly not Altman's intention; rather it is to make fun of it.

B00003CXE7|4.0|A Caesar with little common sense wouldn't have a choice. Gladiator deserves the approved sign not with one, but with two thumbs up.<br /><br />With state-of-the-art digital technology, the Roman epic of director Ridley Scott brings us the return of the glorious city that was Rome. It had never shone so densely opulent; so outlandishly declining.<br /><br />On the verge of dying, Emperor Marcus Aurelius makes the decision to name Maximus, general of his army, his successor, with the hope that he will protect Rome and give back the power to the people. But his ambitious son, decided not to fulfill his father's will, will untie a chain of events that will change the future of the Roman Empire. Maximus will have to survive the jealous wrath of Commodus, the murder of his family and the infamy of being enslaved. But as a gladiator he will find the way to serve Rome and to fulfill the promise done to the late Marcus Aurelius.<br /><br />The epic cinema returned big. Reliving all the pomp and ceremony of old civilizations, Gladiator will dazzle you with extraordinary battles, realistic scenes of fight and admirable views of England, Malta, Italy and Morocco.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is a magnificent gladiator; a combination of brain, muscles and a noble soul, that places him in the same rank of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus or Charlton Heston's Ben Hur. His Maximus is a hero in all the extension of the word, virtuous, genuine, charismatic and very, very human.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is magnificent, from the selection of Joaquim Phoenix as the despicable Commodus, whose resentments and jealousy are concrete, to Richard Harris in its small but impressive Marcus Aurelius.<br /><br />Under the skillful direction of Ridley Scott - who brings out the best from the script supported by a range of technological tools- Gladiator succeeds finding a perfect balance between action and emotion. Its main center is in the characters and in a history that captures the importance of our actions. Their protagonists emit vitality, in the battlefield, in the bloody sand and mainly, they convince us that it's worth to live or die by the values and ideals we have inside.r actions.

6305308659|5.0|After a romantic \\"impasse\\" with her fianc&eacute;e in the seat of the car near the lake, Skip returns to his house and notices in the garden a red rose that moves with the wind. What makes so unusual this simple and common event is that the rose is the only sparkle of color within the monochrome world of Pleasantville.<br /><br />In his directorial debut, Gary Ross (Dave, Big) continues using his style of telling creative fables, this time about a brother and a sister who gets themselves trapped on a television program from the 50's.<br /><br />David and Jennifer are transported to a perfect town with pleasant climate and where the greatest challenge for firemen is to lower cats from trees. From a color-world to another one in black-and-white, where they meet their new parents and friends, who refer to them as Bud and Mary Sue.<br /><br />Soon both kids realize that the lack of color is not the only difference that has Pleasantville. This is a perfect world, without sex or violence, a place where basketball players always win, the parents sleep in separated beds, fire or rain never happens and the thermometer always marks 23 degrees.<br /><br />But as David and Jennifer discover, this much \\"perfection\\" also bring little imagination, no adventures or challenges.<br /><br />Together, David and Jennifer are in charge to spread rebellion and to give a little color to the town. Little time happens without some citizens of Pleasantville finding these changes attractive and embracing them with passion. Lips become red, cheeks pink, sex becomes the great sensation.<br /><br />But for others, the color becomes a threat. The monochrome ones begin to distrust of those who see the colors. Thus, prejudice and discrimination become a part of Pleasantville.<br /><br />This it a film that plays with our understanding of the rules of television show, where old sayings like \\"old times were better\\" and \\"paradisiacal life\\" are true. Also, the movie works as a metaphor about those choosing to live sunk in a safe but bleak conformity or those who enjoy the divine, full pleasures of risk that come with the free will.<br /><br />Here lies the true birth of feelings and emotions. More than external changes, what happens in Pleasantville is that the souls of their citizens leave lethargy and they are taken by the passion, opening new ways and opportunities, even if this entails to know the ugly or sad side of life. Putting it simple, they just want to be human beings.t those choosing to live sunk in a safe but bleak conformity or those who enjoy the divine, full pleasures of risk that come with the free will.  <br /> <br />Here lies the true birth of feelings and emotions.

B00000JCOV|3.0|First of all, I am not a long-time Slipknot fan, or a \\"maggot\\" as they seem to enjoy being called. My girlfriend let me borrow this CD so I could try them out, and it's really strange for me to imagine how Slipknot has nearly managed to become accepted in the mainstream, despite their angry, unfriendly sound. They have taken a liking to an anti-image that has become their trademark: creepy masks, bar codes, and elaborate stage shows. They also have an unprecedented nine members, so at least they establish a unique vibe with the listener before you even pop the CD in. <br /> <br />Any good album should feel smooth and complete for its duration, but unfortunately, Slipknot's debut does not. It feels as if it's divided into two segments. The first half is a strong seven tracks that are undeniably infectious, but the second half is a lackluster assortment that drags along unnevenly. Let's examine the two halves, shall we? The album starts out on a high note. Following a confusing introductory track called \\"0742617000027\\" (eh?) with a repeated phrase, it jumps right into \\"(sic)\\", one of the album's heaviest and most aggressive songs. Corey Taylor's death metal roar, which ends up permeating throughout the entire album, is at times very awesome and other times redundant. In \\"(sic)\\" is where you'll find it most effective because it makes the entire song feel intense and angry like it should. I'm reminded of Metallica's \\"Battery\\" when I hear this song, because they both raise the adrenaline and inspire you to bang your head and get mad, just for the sake of being mad. \\"Eyeless\\" does a great job of maintaining the pace, since anything slower would have been awkward. It's got a catchy hook to it and the best moment of the entire CD, when Taylor belts out a long and tortured scream towards the end. \\"Wait and Bleed\\" is one of Slipknot's most well-known songs and for good reason. It's probably the highlight of the album, even if you've heard it a thousand times. It's short and sweet and surprisingly melodic. \\"Surfacing\\" is a decent track but a mediocre chorus ruins it. It demonstrates one of the low points of Slipknot. The lyrics tend to be very cliched and trite. But don't worry. \\"Spit It Out\\" jumps right back in your face with heavy, surging emotion and a rap-influenced sound. \\"Tattered & Torn\\" is a very experimental track that succeeds in its attempts. It incorporates interesting, percussional rhythms with a haunting hook. The singing downgrades it somewhat, however, and sounds reminiscent of Kurt Cobain's indecipherable mumbling on some of Nirvana's stranger songs. <br /> <br />Then we get into the second half. \\"Me Inside\\" is my personal pick for the worst song on the album, since it's painfully generic and backed up by nothing musically genuine. \\"Liberate\\" has an attention-getting opening riff but is only slightly better. \\"Prosthetics\\" is one of my favorites and probably one of Slipknot's better songs. The first minute is the strongest part, and some creepy lyrics complete everything, making it an all-around excellent track. \\"No Life\\" and \\"Diluted\\" sound almost like the same song with some laughably bad lyrics about being depressed and hating life. I wish I'd had a dime for every time I'd heard that in a song. \\"Only One\\" is not too bad but forgettable. \\"Scissors\\" has some very cool rhythms and sampling, but it could have been about fifteen minutes shorter. There was no need for a long silence and then a strange and sleep-inducing segment followed by a bad bonus track. If the song had ended at five minutes, it would have been great. <br /> <br />All in all, SLIPKNOT was an album that had high and low points. The times that the band tried out different things and applied each of their nine members to a song were shining examples of the kind of music they have the potential to produce. Unfortunately, these moments were few and far between, and they instead chose to stick to the age-old formula of slamming on their instruments and yellingabout teenage angst most of the time. Try a little harder, guys. It could pay off.

B0002DB52M|1.0|Lewis Carroll would have given up writing had he been forced to endure this version of Through the Looking Glass.  This film is anti-moviegoer.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|I was trying to figure out if Trey Parker and Matt Stone were mainly going after George W. Bush or Alec Baldwin in \\"Team America: World Police,\\" but it turns out their real targets were Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer (the song \\"'Pearl Harbor' Sucked and I Miss You\\" was a big clue).  You think that the Bush doctrine of military intervention is being lampooned, but the guy on the suicide mission wearing the dynamite belt is Michael Moore and there are almost as many liberals killed by Team America as there are terrorists (but I might be wrong on that score as I gave up counting dead bodies in movies ever since \\"MAD\\" did the bit about Clint Eastwood in \\"Where Eagles Dare\\").<br /><br />The movie starts off with its best sequence as Team America shows up in Paris to save the City of Lights from terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction.  Team America succeeds, but pays a price as one of their members is killed.  Also, there is some collateral damage, but the important thing is that the terrorists were stopped so everybody should just shut up and be grateful (not necessarily in that order).  What we then have is the introduction of the new team member and a whole bunch of standard action movie scenes, only acted out by marionettes following a script written by Parker, Stone and Pam Brady<br /><br />What I can do is assure you that you will be offended by \\"Team America\\" at some point during this unrated and uncensored version (I can totally understand why the movie was heading for a NC-17 rating on the basis of two shots during the semi-infamous marionettes having sex scene).  But it is not Parker and Stone unless they go too far and that is certainly preferred to not going far enough (for proof, watching \\"Saturday Night Live\\" the next time it is on).  So there are moments when you will laugh yourself silly and other moments where you need to worry about what will come flying out of your mouth if you are not carefully given the visual inspiration provided by the film.<br /><br />Probably the only person who comes out looking good in this movie is Gerry Anderson, the guy who came up with \\"Thunderbirds\\" using the process of \\"Supermarionation,\\" which gets the big screen treatment here (unlike, ironically, the recent \\"Thunderbirds\\" theatrical film).  There are some good gags based on treating the puppets like puppets, but the main laughs come at the expense of the action film genre.  You cannot get through the opening titles without having a bunch of explosives and while there are plenty of funny songs the use of heroic music to pump up the fake bonding moments and emotional travails are actually funnier.  I also liked the juxtaposition of interpersonal revelations with explosions as the team finally sorts out who likes whom.  This is not as great as \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut,\\" but it is the closest that Parker and Stone have come to date, which would be one of those good things you hear about from time to time.<br /><br />The cinematography is by Bill Pope, who shot the \\"Matrix\\" films but is a fan of \\"South Park\\" and tired of shooting blue screens.  The production design by Jim Dultz, the art direction by John Berger and Tom Valentine, and the set direction by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb and Richard C. Walker is pretty impressive for a puppet movie and the featurettes will get you to go back and pore over the movie scene by scene to see what interesting things you can spot in this 1/3 scale world.  That will serve you a lot better than trying to figure out the impolite politics of this film.  I am toying with the idea that maybe the film is an attack on the Bush Administration by embracing the use of force and killing all the activist actors.  Or maybe Parker and Stone just do not like actors.  They certainly do not like Kim Jong Il, but then who does?the film.   <br /> <br />Probably the only person who comes out looking good in this movie is Gerry Anderson, the guy who came up with \\"Thunderbirds\\" using the process of \\"Supermarionation,\\" which gets the big screen treatment here (unlike, ironically, the recent \\"Thunderbirds\\" theatrical film).

B0007GAERG|2.0|It would seem that with a daring album title containing a word like &#34;Emancipation&#34; something REALLY big is going to happen.  Someone will be freed from slavery.  Someone will escape oppression.  Something new will be born from the ashes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mariah Carey -- alias &#34;Mimi&#34; -- seems to still be hopelessly trapped.  A string of every hot producer of the moment can't hide the fact that there's nothing new here, just some slick new beats over the same old stuff.<br /><br />01: &#34;It's Like That&#34;<br />Song opens with Jermaine Dupri doing his usual mushy-mouth vocals over the introductory beats, and the song is all downhill from there.  It wants to be an affirmation AND a catchy dance number, and it sadly falls far short of both.  I will dance to almost anything, but this one didn't make me want to move a muscle.  There's just no energy in the track, and feels like filler.  I give it 2 out of 10.<br /><br />02: &#34;We Belong Together&#34;<br />How To Make A Mariah Carey R&B Ballad: Start with some kind of desire for a man, be it heartbreak or crush or what have you.  Add synthesized beats.  DON'T MIX IT UP, NOT EVEN A TINY BIT.  Serves millions.  This song is almost indistinguishable from so many other songs Mariah's done in the past six or seven years.  There's absolutely nothing new or different about it.  What is she escaping from again?  Convention?  This is about as conventional as it gets.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a BAD song -- it's just not what I'd expect from someone doing -- what is this now, her 10th studio album?  After all these years and all these albums, Mariah is too rich to even bother making more music if she's not going to make an effort to make it different.  Otherwise, what's the point?  This one would be only mediocre from even a novice, but for a veteran like Mariah it's pretty lame.  05/10<br /><br />03: &#34;Shake It Off&#34;<br />I didn't even notice when this song ended, it was so nondescript.  Filler filler filler.  Next!  0/10<br /><br />04: &#34;Mine Again&#34;<br />Okay, Mariah.  You've been in the game for a long time, and we all know you can sing.  So what's the point of belting away at this number like you've still got something to prove?  She sounds like an amateur, like Christina Aguilera or somebody, who doesn't know the difference between controlling the power of her pipes for the good of the song and just blithely seeing how loud she can get and how high she can go without veering off key.  Painful.  Sadly, it could've been a great song, because the 70s style funk beat behind it is refreshing and smooth.  It just calmly plays beneath Mariah's wailing as if it didn't have a care in the world, and I gradually started tuning her out and paying attention to it instead.  A few extra points for that beat, since it saved the song as much as it could be salvaged.  04/10<br /><br />05: &#34;Say Something&#34;<br />First off, three points are instantly knocked off for the title's resemblance to that Britney Spears song.  Second, even a smooth beat courtesy of the Neptunes can't make this track very interesting, and Snoop Dogg is sadly wasted.  Okay, he wants to lay her down and do<br />this then pick her up and do that.  What's new here?  What's liberated?  In the chorus, Mariah keeps singing, &#34;If it's worth your while, say somethin'.&#34;  Well it would have been worth my while to skip this track, but all I'll say is that this is a forgettable song and smacks of filler.  Snoop Dogg used as FILLER???  Now THAT'S something.  03/10<br /><br />06: &#34;Stay The Night&#34;<br />Once again Mariah's vocal posturing takes away from what would otherwise be a decent song, with a great back beat.  Amerie could have knocked this song sideways and really made it hum with sexy energy.  In Carey's hands, it takes on a whiny quality that would drive any man away from staying the night.  Yikes.  04/10<br /><br />07: &#34;Get Your Number&#34;<br />Jermaine Dupri's back and doing less than ever to enhance a song.  This song seems like another attempt at dance music, and I can almost see the awkward choreography in my head from the inevitable MTV effort.  Is THIS the secret of Emancipation?  Is Mariah trying to reinvent herself as a dance-hall diva?  Hey, it worked for Cher.  Sadly, it doesn't work for Carey, at least not on this track.  02/10  Let's move on to . . .<br /><br />08: &#34;One And Only&#34;<br />This song is apparently Miss. Mimi's Emancipation From Singing Slowly.  Or maybe she's just trying to keep up with Twista.  Either way, it doesn't sound new, refreshing, freeing or interesting.  02/10<br /><br />09: &#34;Circles&#34;<br />Wow!  Finally a good one, after eight tracks of crap.  This song is simple and sweet, Carey's vocal energetics actually fit the song, and for once she manages to avoid overdoing it.  The beat of it is fresh enough that it doesn't sound *COMPLETELY* like her usual &#34;I want the boy&#34; balladeering and is actually a pretty well written song.  It's not Bob Dylan, but it's about the best one could expect from the Emancipated Mimi.  07/10<br /><br />10: &#34;Your Girl&#34;<br />This song opens with Carey singing coyly, &#34;I should be your girl.&#34;  And then I realized that I just have to say it: Mariah is damn near forty.  She is too old to be anyone's &#34;girl&#34; anymore.  She needs to leave these kinds of lyrics to the Beyonces of the world, grow up, and grow into something more mature and worthy of a woman her age.  This song is so cutesy I bet JoJo's people would have rejected it in favor of something with more edge.  So why did Miss Mimi decide it worked for her?  You tell me.  All I know is that it's not only the worst song on this album, it's also one of the most grating songs I've ever heard, period.  P.U.  -10/10<br /><br />11: &#34;I Wish You Knew&#34;<br />Yet ANOTHER song about Mariah Carey's helplessness in the face of a boy she wants and can't have.  Okay, we get it!  You're rich and famous but you're still &#34;one of us&#34; because you can't get a guy to like you either.  Awww!  You're just like me, let's be best friends forever!<br /><br />You know, this brings up something important.  Mariah Carey has been through a lot in life.  She's multi-racial, which must have caused her some strife growing up and trying to make it in the divided music industry.  She had a nervous breakdown on national television and was hospitalized for a short period of time.  She was kicked off her last record company because of poor album sales.  Everyone in the known world hated her movie.  She's been divorced at least twice, right?  So WHY IN GOD'S NAME is she STILL singing these fluffy songs like nothing has happened in her life worth singing about?  Not a single song so far on this whole album has spoken to anything even remotely personal.  Every single song she has here could just as easily have been performed by another singer.  None of them are really HERS.  They're not unique or individual or even interesting.  They're just a bunch of songs.  Where's the real stuff?  Where's the pain, the emotion, the loves lost or gained, the success and the failure?  In short, where is the LIFE of a person who has lived so many?  Nowhere to be found.<br /><br />It should also be noted that this song falls into the &#34;random live track&#34; trap that better artists than Carey have fallen into.  Suddenly having all those voices cheering just seems like a painful way of her affirming herself as a musical powerhouse with a legion of fans.  She's reminding us of how popular she is in the song, as if to warn us that disliking her means disagreeing with all these people. Well, I don't dislike her.  Back in the day, I was a true fan.  But I DO dislike this track and, increasingly, this album.  01/10<br /><br />12: &#34;To The Floor&#34;<br />I love Nelly so much that this criminal misuse of him is almost unforgivable.  This is another wannabe dance number that'll haveto be remixed if it's ever going to make it in the clubs.  I don't know what Nelly's doing here aside from collecting a fat paycheck, because these sorry rhymes could've been done by anyone and are certainly not worthy of his talent.  Actually, I may have to stop liking Nelly . . . between this and his collaborations with Aguilera and that country singer guy, he's really been disappointing lately.  And this song is about 31 flavors of lame.  03/10<br /><br />13: &#34;Joy Ride&#34;<br />Extra points for being unexpected.  The title made me think I was in for another fast-paced number coyly insinuating sex without ever admitting to its existence the way most of her similar songs do.  But instead it's a melodic, airy listen about finding love (surprise) that stands out from the rest of the songs.  Maybe I'm just being nice at this point as the album draws to a close and I struggle to justify the hour and twenty or so minutes I spent listening to it so that it won't seem like a TOTAL waste of time.  Either way, I give it 7.5 out of 10.<br /><br />14: &#34;Fly Like A Bird&#34;<br />The grating lack of originality in this title is just indicative of the entire album, so let's not quibble over that.  The gospel chorus is an unexpected treat and once again Carey's bombastic vocals actually work with the song.  It's a nice end note to an otherwise unremarkable and dismal album.  06/10<br /><br />So in the end, I can't really say what Mariah Carey/Mimi has been emancipated from.  I downloaded the album legally off of Napster, so I can't read the liner notes for insight and clues.  What I can read is the desperation between every note as Mariah struggles to keep her finger in the music industry's shrinking pie.  I still can't figure out why she bothers.  This album is like store-bought apple pie.  Why should you waste time with such a mass-produced creation when you know the real thing is worth waiting for?  Heads up to you &#34;Mimi&#34;: I'm waiting for the REAL Mariah to release an album and talk about some real stuff.  Brandy made it happen after only three lame albums and if you're so determined to mime the efforts of younger talents, then start with her.  Delve in and come up with something meaningful, something different and new or for God's sake stay at home, count your money, and emancipate ALL of us from this kind of repetitive, pointless dreck.<br /><br />Written in May of 2005; resubmitted August 2007.ings up something important.

0534521169|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B00004Z4WR|1.0|Im not sure who started this trend of directing movies so that they have the camera cut every 2-4 seconds.  The movie SWAT and also watching Dr. Phil would be very good examples of this quick cut trend of editing.  I dare anyone to watch any of the previous mentioned and be able to count to six before the camera cuts.  It's impossible.  Once you realize 4.9 seconds is the limit of a hold in a shot, (For me anyway) it becomes almost impossible to watch.  Similar to watching a strobe light.  Is it possible that it is cheaper to make productions this way or could it be a sinister plot to shorten viewer attention spans?  In either case this movie is worse than watching a blank screen.  It's so bad that I no longer like Nick Cage. After I started watching, I was \\"Gone in about 18 minutes.\\"
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is an extremely clever and politically incorrect movie.  Team America is a uniquely conservative movie:  it showcases Team America (which is a metaphor for the U.S. Military), along with the lead character, who acts as a spy (CIA?) in the Muslim world, attempting to discover the latest information on what the terrorists are planning.  Hollywood celebrities at lampooned, with Matt Damon being portrayed as a retarded man.<br /><br />The general gyst of the story is that Kim Jung Ill, the leader of North Korea, is supplying terrorists with the products they need to carry out their attacks.  Hollywood celebrities--who actually support the enemy--take Jung Ill's side and take every effort to help him against Team America.  (So this movie really is realistic.  After all, we all know that Hollywood celebrities hate America).  Team America ultimately wins.<br /><br />The story is incredibly funny:  it makes fun of Muslims, the French, terrorists, foreign leaders, the screen actors guild, actors, ...<br /><br />I hope there will be another one like it.  But it's not likely.  This is an instant classic.
0316168815|3.0|This book, as so many other readers have noted, started out very strong (albeit, disturbing) and then just \\"lost it\\" in the middle.  The writing itself was wonderful, but the plot meandered in the second half of the book.  The mother's abandonment of her family was where it started to break down. And, there were scenes that were REALLY out of place - like the 14 year-old protagonist falling out of heaven to inhabit her friend's body and, while here on earth temporarily, begged her old boyfriend to have sex with her.  Also unrealistic was that she appeared to be in a heaven without the existence of a God.  The book certainly lacked focus toward the end, and the ultimate comeuppance for the murderer was extremely unsatisfying.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|This film is essentially a parody of action films, and it does that pretty well.  If you think this film is a political satire, you're going to be disappointed because its political commentary is about on the same level as a Dirty Harry movie.  Sure, it takes some quick whacks, but that's about it; even South Park episodes explore issues to a much greater extent.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Fun and cute.  Those words best describe the Gilmore Girls.  I love the second season.  The relationship Lorelai and Rory have is so heart-warming.  They're there for each other through tough times, and they tell each other everything.  Christopher came back often to spend time with Rory (which was special.)  Then there's Luke and Kirk, who can be pretty funny sometimes.  Jess acts like an idiot who doesn't do much, but he's so gentle and nice around Rory.  Dean and Rory are a good couple, too.  My favorite episodes are The Road Trip To Harvard, Presenting Lorelai Gilmore, The Inns & Outs Of Inns, Run Away, Little Boy, Lorelai's Graduation Day, and I Can't Get Started.  Overall, this is a wonderful disc set that I recommend.
B0000021S9|5.0|Recorded when Chicago was still a cohesive unit (not Peter Cetera's back-up band), this album is far tighter, and has far better sound than the Carnegie Hall album.   <br /> <br />I bought this album in vinyl as a Japenese import in the late 70's. I never thought it would make it to CD. When it did, I scooped it up. If you like the sound of Chicago at their peak, then THIS is the album to buy.
B000002AGB|5.0|THE WHO LIVE AT THE ISLE OF WIGHT FESTIVAL is the definitive release of The Who's TOMMY tour.  In 1969 and 1970 when the Who was on the road promoting their Tommy LP (released May 1969) they didn't quite perform in front of Mod audiences like they did in the UK back when they first started.  Instead, they played to crowds of hippies...at psychedelic ballrooms such as Fillmore East and West, and at rock festivals such as the legendary Woodstock Music and Arts Fair.  After Woodstock, the British fans got the message and started organizing festivals of their own.  The Isle of Wight Festival of 1969 attracted 150,000 fans and featured Bob Dylan.  The Who stole the show and earned rave reviews.  They played most of Tommy as they did at Woodstock as well as other hits.  So for an entire year they continued their tour playing more psychedelic venues.   <br /> <br />Although The Who generally stayed away from open air festivals, they didn't turn down their opportunity to replay the success of the Isle of Wight Festival, and in August 1970 came back for a return engagement.  This festival was held on the other side of the island and reportedly 600,000 hippies attended, lured by sets from The Doors, Joni Mitchell, Miles Davis and a slew of Woodstock veterans...Jimi Hendrix, Sly & The Family Stone, Joan Baez, Richie Havens, etc. <br /> <br />The format of the Isle of Wight 1970 set was the same as what they were doing in '69...some warmup tunes: HEAVEN AND HELL by John Entwistle started things off in high gear with power chords and windmills and pure excitement.  I CAN'T EXPLAIN continued to hold the second slot, and YOUNG MAN BLUES, then a few new numbers (the band just recorded for an EP record that was to be released in October 1970 but was scrapped for the \\"Lifehouse\\" project).  Although Townshend had previously swore that he was going to retire it after the Metropolitan Opera shows in June '70, TOMMY was still the main attraction of the Who set, and they perform most of it as the middle section.  Highlights abound including OVERTURE, a great SPARKS and an estounding finale SEE ME FEEL ME that got the entire festival crowd on its feet.  Crank it up, it sounds powerful on your home stereo system.  After TOMMY, The Who continues with the obligatory SUMMERTIME BLUES as well as SHAKIN ALL OVER/TWIS AND SHOUT.  <br /> <br />The original tapes were remastered and the entire show sounds amazing.  It's loud, and the stereo spectrum is perfect.  The huge crowd was alive for the two and a half hours the Who was onstage, and more people witnessed TOMMY that night than any other performance in their amazing career.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I started watching Veronica Mars mid-season, when One Tree Hill was on hiatus.  I could kick myself for not watching this show from the beginning.  I stopped watching One Tree Hill and the O.C. because the shows have little substance to them and the characters are bland.  Veronica Mars's characters are multidimensial.  Nobody is completely perfect or innocent, and the guilty usually have redeeming qualities.  Veronica's cases usually have a twist in them, like you end up feeling sorry for the bad guy who gets caught.  I was a big fan of Desperate Housewives and still watch it, but I think Veronica Mars's mysteries are done better.  VM is the best show of 2004 and is still the only show I'm looking forward to in the fall of 2005.  It is a smart show and way better than mindless reality shows or dumb shows on the major networks.  Do yourself a favor, and \\"get a clue.\\"  Give this show a chance.  You won't regret it.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Winner of the National Society of Film Critic's best experimental film, the New York Film Critics Circle's best animated film, the Venice Film Festival's best film, and many others awards, Richard Linklater's arresting \\"Waking Life\\" offers a novel movie-going experience. Employing a process called interpolated rotoscoping, Detour Films enlisted a team of artists to digitally trace over live-action film footage, a process yielding shape-shifting and pulsing images that perpetually reconfigure themselves. <br /> <br />Revisiting the non-narrative style of \\"Slacker,\\" Linklater celebrates inquisitiveness. The story follows the persona of a perplexed seeker of truth (Wiley Wiggins) as he puzzles over whether he is awake or dreaming. Maundering through the streets of Austin, he encounters exponents of various ideas, theories and philosophies; he comes to find meaning in the act of posing questions, striving for answers-exercising one's mind to feel alive. <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I love this CD. Every song is beautiful and unique with meaningful lyrics. Gavin's voice is so different from other singers because there's something in it that sounds so honest. I highly recommend this album to anyone who's sick of hearing songs with profane lyrics or ones that just make you bob your head along with it. These tracks make people happy. :)
6304708521|1.0|Well I'm a big fan of the movie, and I got it on DVD a couple years back. Recently I purchased a new copy at HMV and when I played it... IT WAS A HORRIBLE DVD!!!! The audio is horrible. I.E. At the end of the movie, when the reprise of the the title track is played It's original note is supposed to be E. but on the DVD, It's Eb! The picture is horrible, it's all grainy and washed out. I.E. In the Resturant scene, the spaghetti looks like lettuce and nachos. So all in all, you're better off getting the VHS. it has better picture and sound.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Later Dire Straits is unconventional and difficult to label. While their early stuff was essentially rock, On Every Street does not so easily fit that definition. Sure, it has a dosage of rock n roll, but much of the album is comprised of slow, jazzy and bluesy ballads only rock n roll masters could concoct. As always, Knopflers guitar is exhilirating, with steel resonator and electric highlighting most of the tracks. He dabbles some in country, folk, jazz, and heavy rock.  <br /> <br />The songwriting is of exceptional caliber; subject matter is always something Knopfler takes seriously when writing, even if some of his songs have silly topics, such as Ticket to Heaven. They sound silly anyway, but they are serious in the message they convey. It and My Parties reveal the hyprocrisy of televangelism and yuppie lifestyles respectively.  <br /> <br />On Every Street is the title track for good reason. It is dark, and deals with an elusive romance (or perhaps something else - the lyrics are vague on what is actually being sought). Dark, but beautiful, much like everything else on the album.
B000002GVO|1.0|Dated nonsense from has been rock band. The title cut is mediocre. \\"New kid in town\\" is pretty bad and the rest of the album is below that. Their are albums which sound better with age, this isn't one.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This closes out the career of the man in black, and no ablum could more effectively do so. The songs are predominatly covers with some of Cash's own songwriting intermingled. The instrumentation is simplistic, predominantly acoustic; none of the songs are musically complicated, and some of the songs are probably weaker than the originals. But the ablum is carried by Cash's strong, but wavering voice that embodies a tired emotion. His singing on this ablum communicates his readiness to die. <br /> <br />Cash manages to take songs such as NIN's Hurt, the Beatles In My Life, Simon's Bridge over Troubled Water, and the Eagle's Desperado, and wields them to churn out a very dark, somber album. The overall mood is that this life is tough, but paradise is just around the bend.
B000002JKA|5.0|That British MTV rocks idiot knows nothing about true music. How dare that (...) mock John Petrucci and say that Avril Lavigne is talented! Dream Theater pawns Avril's ass any day!<br /><br />Anyways, I don't own the album, but I downloaded some songs off it and was amazed by them. I think these guys might be another band I might get into. \\"Lie\\" has some crunch added to it, yet it is being a melodic track at the same time, as well as \\"6:00\\" and \\"Caught In A Web\\". John Petrucci is an amazing guitarist, and whoever mocks that should have MTV removed from their TV.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's strange to think that this turned out to be their Swan Song as this is better than most bands are at their peak. <br /> <br />All the turmoil and distrust that must have surrounded the making of this and the previous album Let it Be (although Let it Be would be the bands final release in 1970) yet they some how constrive to make on of the greatest albums ever. <br /> <br />There are so many highlights, Come Together,Summer Son, Octopusses Garden, I want you (she's so heavy), but the main attraction of the album is the intergation of tunes from You never gave me your money to polythene Pam, and She came through the bathroom window to End. <br /> <br />This section is pure genius, and is worth buying for that alone. <br /> <br />Like this album, why not try: <br /> <br />A Hard Days Night <br />Rubber Soul <br />Revolver <br />Sgt Peppers <br />The White Album
B000000W3G|2.0|Dont buy this unless you are a really big fan of the band and has lots of money. Instead of releasing a 5 disc box-set they could have released a double album, and still fitted all the songs minus the ones that are already on Mellon Collie. <br /> <br />There are some good songs here, mostly on the \\"Zero\\" disc, but overall the songs are just mediocre, just like b-sides most often are. I see that this box-set recieves a lot of 5 star reviews, and it feels like its just a hype. Is it the songs they like so much, or the package, or do they just feel they have to give this a 5 star review because they spent so much money on it (combined with their unconditional love for the band). <br /> <br />I was myself a big fan of the band at the time when I bough this and I still didnt like it. So dont expect to like it just because you liked \\"Mellon Collie\\", \\"Gish\\" or \\"Pisces Iscariot\\". There just arent any great musical moments or surprises on this box-set. In my opinion it wasnt worth the money.
B000002UAR|5.0|I first got into The Beatles via Sgt Peppers, this at the time (and still is today) was being raved as the greatest thing since sliced bread, so you can imagine my dissapointment when it wasn't, though I still thought it was a great album. <br /> <br />It wasn't until years later when a friend recommended Revolver to me that I began a Beatles fan or more acuratly respected The Beatles. <br /> <br />You can imagine my doubts at first, Sgt Peppers was supposed to be great but though definetly deserving of five stars it was hardly The greatest album ever, that I'd been led to believe it was. <br /> <br />So imagine my surprise when I listened to Revolver, it damn made me appreciate how great The Beatles were and to this date is easily one of the top ten albums I own if not of all time. <br /> <br />They did so many great albums and this is one of them, I think The White Album is slightly better but I wouldn't begrudge anyone who disagreed as Revolver is great too. <br /> <br />And like all great things, the best is saved for last, Tomorrow never Knows is perhaps the greatest thing the fab four ever did. <br /> <br />If you like this, why not try: <br /> <br />A Hard Days Night <br />Rubber Soul <br />Sgt Peppers <br />The White Album <br />Abbey Road
B000006NPY|2.0|Even though I have considered myself a fan of the Pumpkins for eight years, I have never really liked Billy Corgans voice. He has written lots of good songs and he has ruined a lot of them simply by opening his mouth. As long as there was a massive sound, with lots of distorted guitars and drums, Corgans voice didnt sound that bad. This album however doesnt have that wall of sound.  <br /> <br />It is a very calm album, with a drum-machine, piano, and without any long guitar solos. It could have sounded very good if someone like Leonard Cohen sang on it instead of Corgan. Corgan whines like a little child and its very irritating to listen to after a while. I can only imagine how gigantic his ego must be, believing that his voice has to be everywhere.
0385493622|4.0|Singh provides an excellent reconstruction of the events leading up to and involving Andrew Wiles enormous solution to Fermat's \\"most difficult problem in history\\".  Scientific achievement most often requires huge effort and concentration, at levels hard to imagine.  Singh takes us through the heights of amazing rewards, and the depths of self-doubt and depression.  Wiles goes through both, and unhappily, many other mathematicians (tackling Fermat's Enigma or not) have ended with the later.   <br /> <br />Singh backs the reader up in history to Pythagoras, starting with that most important, and yet relatively simple mathematical proof.  He strolls us past Euclid, and (unfortunately) steams through progress made by Indian and Muslim mathematicians in the middle-ages.  Singh provides enough math to grab at the reader, some in the appendixes (more involved), and enough in the text to lay the ground work for Fermat. The 17th century injects renewed life into science and math, and into Singh's narrative.  The issues involved with Fermat's \\"final theorem\\" may be simple enumerate, but not to understand.  Singh once again gets bogged down, at this point in trying to bridge sophisticated concepts of modern math into a base of knowledge through which the reader can  connect to Wiles achievement in 1994.  Once that base is formed, and Singh moves to Wiles, the energy of the book increases by leaps and bounds. The book is very engaging in the last 3rd, where we can finally glimpse the incredible struggle, lasting over 8 years, that Wiles went through to prove Fermat right.   <br /> <br />This book gets very high praise for linking incredibly complex science to the humanity of the people working with it.  Readers will gain a fascination for Wiles' effort and achievement, and perhaps learn to want more.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I remember when this album came out in 1986.  I agree it was definitely different than previous Duran albums, but I loved it anyway.  It had been my favorite Duran album over the years and recently after listening to their new album Astronaut (which is also excellent), I listened to Notorious again and was quite pleased.  Even after almost 20 years I still enjoy it.  In fact there are certain tracks on it such as Skin Trade which I think are brilliant.  I always thought of Notorious as a follow up to Arcadia's So Red the Rose more than to Seven and the Ragged Tiger.  I'm quite comfortable with that since the album is excellent in it's own right regardless of whether it sounds like previous Duran albums or not.   Best tracks in my opinion are: <br />Skin Trade <br />Winter Marches On <br />Vertigo <br />Proposition <br />American Science <br /> <br />I do admit that this album had the first song that I wasn't a total fan of (Meet el Presidente) which was unfortunately a sign of things to come for a while.  Not that this song is bad, it just wasn't my style.  All That She Wants Is makes up for it on Big Thing though. <br /> <br />In conclusion, don't overlook this album.  It holds many treasures of mature work.
B000002J5K|5.0|More than half of the immense cult appeal that the Blues Brothers have comes from its amazing, once in a lifetime soundtrack. How can anyone say that this is not a real blues album? Sure, the Blues Brothers were first and foremost a comedy act (spawned like so many others by Saturday Night Live) but the blues was deep in their souls. It's clear from their performances of 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Sweet Home Chicago' and 'Everybody Needs Somebody to Love' just how talented and soulful a vocalist the late great John Belushi was - as talented as a singer as he was as a comedian. Not to mention the fact that the Blues Brothers were backed by a group of some of the best, most celebrated session musicians of the time, including Donald 'Duck' Dunn and Matt 'Guitar' Murphy, among others. <br /> <br />And if that's not enough - if you're so much of a purist that you're still not convinced - where else do you get James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab Calloway - four among the true gods of blues, R&B and soul - on one album? All of their performances on this soundtrack are truly classics. James Brown does classic gospel with 'The Old Landmark', a powerhouse of a spiritual that will have you bouncin' and praisin' all over the place. Aretha, in one of the most famous performances, sings 'Think' and sends shivers down my spine. The Genius performs 'Shake a Tail Feather', an energetic and funky R&B classic that matches his greatest songs. And finally, the wonderful Mr. Calloway, in a rare performance shortly before his death, sings his signature song, Minnie the Moocher, and I'll be damned if it doesn't sound as good as he did nearly half a century before. <br /> <br />Still, mainstream, you say? Well, maybe it is, in a sense. It wouldn't be the first time for any of these artists. But even when Ray, Aretha and James were making softened up pop for white audiences they were still the best of the best, and this recording is no exception. With the instrumental power of the Blues Brothers Band behind them (also present on the classic recording of the Peter Gunn theme), they sound as good as ever, and so do Belushi and Aykroyd, comedians first but also two of the best damn white blues singers I've heard. Only one track, in fact, reminds us that this is actually a comedy, and that is of course the theme from Rawhide (the producers made the smart move of giving us only a small taste of the Brothers' performance at Bob's Country Bunker by excluding their version of 'Stand By Your Man'); had it been replaced by John Lee Hooker singing 'Boom Boom' (sadly missing from the CD) the album could have had a different name and then blues fans would have hailed it as the fantastic collection that it is. Even without Hooker, the soundtrack is still wonderful and a great purchase to any lover of blues, R&B, soul, funk or rock n' roll and to any fan of this classic movie. Highly recommended.
B00004NJJQ|5.0|The Phenomenon known as UFO begins here. Though UFO released albums before this, it wasnt until the joining of Michael Schenker, the departure of Mick Bolton and the release of Phenonmenon that UFO found their legendary hard rock sound and style. When Michael Schenker joined the band he was only to be a guest for a few gigs, because he was a member of The Scorpions at the time, well that ended, he left The Scorpions and joined UFO full time. With a large hole in The Scorpions they called on Uli Jon Roth to replace. When Phenomenon was released it was the bands strongest album so far.<br /><br />The album opens up with the hard rocker 'Oh, My' with killer vocals and an out of this world guitar riff and solo that showed that UFO had finaly chosen the right guitar player for the job. Next is the Rocker/balladier 'Crystal Light' filled with beautiful lyrics and arpegiated guitar that must be heard to hear how well it flows. Truly one of the bands best slower songs. UFO's biggest hit 'Doctor, Doctor' is next with a blisterng solo and fiery leads by Schenker and a catchy chorus to boot it's no wonder this was the bands biggest hit single. 'Space Child' is another ballad/rock song with a really cool melody and beautiful lyrics. Phil Moggs vocals are just flat out amazing on Space Child, maybe this song is why they got called space rock, what is that anyway? My favorite song on the album 'Rock Bottom' is next. It has one of my favorite Michael Schenker guitar solos and a really cool and catchy chorus. This is what hard rock should be, hard, heavy and fun! 'To Young To Know' has some good guitar and is very bluesy, probley the most bluesy song the band has ever recorded.  it's one of the better songs the band has ever done as well. 'Time On My Hands' is a slower song that once again features really good vocals by Phil Mogg. Also the acoustic guitar adds a reall nice touch to the song as well as the album of mostly hard rocking electric guitar. Ok, so I take back what I said about To Young To Know being the most bluesy song UFO made, 'Built For Comfor' wins the title hands down, the guitar and vocal delivery easly sound like You shook Me by Led Zeppelin.... But Better. Other then having a cool title 'Lickstick Traces' is a really good song featuring some of Michael Schenkers best guitar playing, ever! Michael Schenker is known for being one of the worlds most melodic guitar players, and it shows on 'Queen Of The Deep' the albums closer is one of the strongest tracks UFO ever recorded. Perfect for closing the album. Its really dark and huanting, a really cool song for ending Phenomenon. Now that I think about it they could have called Queen of the Deep Phenomenon. That would have been perfect!<br /><br />After this UFO would release four more albums with Michael Schenker on guitar before he would leave to rejoin The Scorpions and then form his own band Michael Schenker Group (MSG). Those next for albums are along with this the best albums UFO ever released, later in the bands carear Schenker would return to do a few more albums, as he did with The Scorpions, the albums these bands did with Schenker wee the best albums they would ever create. Do your self a favor and pick up this classic UFO record as any fan of hard rock should enjoy, and if you are a guitar player and you dont know Michael Schenker, then you dont know guitar!d about To Young To Know being the most bluesy song UFO made, 'Built For Comfor' wins the title hands down, the guitar and vocal delivery easly sound like You shook Me by Led Zeppelin....

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down have returned and they make sure you know it too. The first single is a perfect song for this time period. Bring your own Bombs is very political and i love it. I know this is a short review but i am ovecome with excitement just thinking about listening to it again. Go buy it. Its hard, melodic, and has crazy lyrics.
B000002U9P|5.0|I bought this CD for only one song, \\"Break Every Rule\\", and I found that far from having only one track that appeals to me, I love the whole record. Of course, this is the follow up to her big comeback record, and the superstars of the 80's came out in their strength to help write and record this record. Byran Adams, Phil Collins, Rupert Hine, Steve Winwood, David Bowie, Mark Knopfler either wrote or played on the record. Most of them did both. It sounds a little 80's at first, but the songwriting talent is so immense, the record is so musical that you soon forget some of the novelties of 80's production and find yourself listening to the fabulous voice of Tina Turner. She takes all the material and really makes it her own, without losing that wonderful sense of nuance in required by each song. Worthy of mention also are the team of Terry Britten and Graham Lyle. When the big name stars were done filling in on one half of the tracks, these two keep their end up to par with polished writing and solid production. Oddly enough, \\"Break Every Rule\\" doesnt seem to appear on the new Greatest Hits package of hers. Maybe they hope people will buy this record just to get that track? Take my advice and do so, you wont regret it. I love this record and I think you will too!
0553577123|5.0|Reading the whole diary was a very big influence to my life. What happened in world war II and how bad people were treated is just devastating. This book gives you a good insight from the point of view of what really happened. Also Anne Frank's diary was about her changing from being girl to woman also. Yes there are some parts that seem like she is just yapping her mouth but that is natural when you convey your feelings to your personal diary. Every book has good points and bad points. I will write on both<br /><br />Good Points<br /><br />1. Gives good perspective of what WWII was like<br /><br />2. Lets you know a person who deserved to live<br /><br />3. Helps understand children going through puberty and how their mind changes<br /><br />4. Reminds us of the horror of what the Nazi's did and should of never happened<br /><br />Bad Points<br /><br />1. Anne at times carries on and on (but she wanted to be a journalist)<br /><br />2. If you are looking for a book that is straight to the point this isn't that kind of book (This is a diary)<br /><br />Overall I love this book for its reality and down to earth point of view. Makes you think about what it was really like. Anne Frank was a girl that was killed just for her belief in God. The Nazi's should never been allowed to do this but it happened. May the mistakes of WWII never happen again.
0380715430|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much and so thoroughly, that I have read it probably 4 times.  Everytime I do read it, I seem to gleen something new from it.  The English language is a fascinating combination of different languages and we are the better for it.  I highly recommend it.
B000000OA6|5.0|I'm referring to an obviously little known fact on this album, the song \\"Bijou\\" was about Freddy Mercury's other cat, the other one being Delilah which most people knew.  I doubt this review will ever get read, but I would like to add to the kudos that have been given this album and that is this was the finest way they could have closed out this chapter of Queen.  Now they (Roger and Brian anyway) have teamed up again and are now on tour so that a new generation of fans can hear the nucleous of this band with Paul Rodgers (of Free and Bad Company) and Spike Edney, Jamie Moses backing them to show bands today what a \\"performance\\" is.  Anyway Innuendo was a fantastic sendoff and contained some serious rock, melodic rock, don't take this too seriously rock and just a great blend of different styles that most bands cannot even contemplate over an entire career much less on just one album which Queen routinely did from their beginnings.  The way I describe this CD is that it can be considered Rock music for adults...period!!!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Mesmerize, although defentaly not as good as System Of A Down's Toxicity CD is still a great CD.  It stays true to what System has always been, yet different enough to pass through.  No matter how much commercialization they've gotten with their singles \\"Chop Suey!' and \\"BYOB\\" theyve never changed...A truely respectable band indeed!  The only problems with this album at all is that a couple of tracks sound monotone (ONLY IN THEIR INTRO's), and the album is way short!<br /><br />01 Soldier Side: A great intro...What more can i say for this dreary yet meaningful 1min beginning? 8/10<br /><br />02 B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bombs): The fist single off of the album, and with great reason!  This song is so catchy, explosive, and informative all wrapped in one!  Defenatly my favorite track on the album!  This track is such a wow, and anyone who says it sucks just because its popular can...  nevermind :D 10/10<br /><br />03 Revenga: This song reminds me of Queen somewhat...  And it has a very catchy chorus when they go \\"ahhahhahhahahahhhh\\"...er somethin like that, and i feel the rhythm of the chorus too 8/10<br /><br />04 Cigaro: Besides for B.Y.O.B., the most known track on the album because of the internet leek in December.  This song is pretty explosive, and fun to listen to i might add (My c**k is much bigger than yours!).  When i firsy heard this song, i kinda thought it sounded like a song from the self-titled album, or at least something new...  Great song 8/10<br /><br />05 RadioVideo: Everyone on the S.O.A.D. message board dubbed this one of there fave songs.  This song is weird, but great (usual System stuff), has quite an explosive chorus...  I just dont know who Danny and Lisa are 8/10<br /><br />06 This Cocaine...: Shotened the title cause its way long.  This song is kind of a fusion of \\"Suite-Pee\\" and \\"X\\" (past S.O.A.D. songs), and its pretty explosive.  Talking about STD's i think.  8/10<br /><br />07 Violent Pornagraphy: My second, or possibly first favorite track on Mezmerize!  The lyrics are mad funny, and catchy, backed with the great System music.  This is probably the single reason little kiddies shouldnt have the album, lets just say that much! -9/10<br /><br />08 Question!: This song could very well get confused with \\"Suggestions\\" for more than one reason.  At the end it goes all head banging with the drums, and it kinda catches me by suprise the last few seconds. -7/10<br /><br />09 Sad Statue: This song starts really heavy, but winds down in the chorus (does get heavy again).  The chorus is really catchy (You and me will all go in history with a sad statue of liberty and a generation that didnt agree- Defenantly an Anti-Iraq War song).  This song is probably one of the heaviest on the album! 8/10<br /><br />10 Old School Hollywood: This songs great for both headbangers, and techno-freaks!  This song describes Darons trip to a baseball game somewhere.  Its just fun to listen to, and it still brings the heat!- 8.9/10<br /><br />11 Lost In Hollywood: I absolutely love this song!  Daron did such a good job with the lyrics and singing, its unbeleivable.  This is a soft song, and the longest on the album! (5:22) A great end to a great CD! 10/10<br /><br />All in all, its System Of A Down all over again!  I cant wait for Hypnotize to come out (or be leeked on to the Internet...whichever comes first!), or possibly first favorite track on Mezmerize!   The lyrics are mad funny, and catchy, backed with the great System music.   This is probably the single reason little kiddies shouldnt have the album, lets just say that much! -9/10 <br /> <br />08 Question!: This song could very well get confused with \\"Suggestions\\" for more than one reason.

B0000028P8|5.0|I have been listening to Mariah Carey since 1991 and she is my favorite singer of all time!!  This Unplugged was Mariah's first real live performance and boy can she sing live!!!  I love all these songs, all 7 of them, they all sound incredible!!!  I've noticed that a lot of people actually prefer the Unplugged version of If It's Over than the album version but to be honest, I don't know why!  First, the album version sounds fuller and richer and second, the album version is longer!  The album version has an extra verse that the Unplugged version doesn't!  Don't get me wrong, I love the Unplugged version too but overall, I prefer the album version.  Mariah's version of The Jackson 5's I'll Be There is such an amazing cover, no wonder it went to #1!  I've heard both versions of I'll Be There and no one can outdo Mariah!!!  No one!!!  I also own the VHS tape of this MTV Unplugged and recommend it to anyone who loves Mariah's Unplugged CD.  I recommend this CD who any Mariah fan and anyone who likes Unplugged performances!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Alright. I just finished viewing this film for the first time and thought that I had to comment on it. This movie is incredible, words cannot possibly describe the effect this film will have on you. It's funny, sad, uplifting, nostalgic, wonderful, and absolutely stunning. It will have you in tears at some parts, and have you on the floor laughing at others. <br /> <br />The ensemble cast is incredible. River Phoenix gives one of his most dramatic performance ever, Wil Wheaton is fantastic as the lovable Gordie, Jerry O'Connel gives us much needed humor, and Cory Feldman shows his true colors as Teddy DuChamp. <br /> <br />Stand By Me has fascinated me ever since discovering River Phoenix, who quickly became my favorite actor. I wasn't sure I would like it; the plot seemed rather dull, but I finally gave in, and decided to rent it when I learned that Wil Wheaton was in it (I'm a Star Trek fan). I was more than pleasantly surprised by the pure perfection this film delivers.  <br /> <br />If you have not yet seen Stand By Me, I highly advise you to buy it. You will not be dissappointed...I would bet my life on it.

To be honest the whole film entirelly crap from the beginning all the way to the ending titles, but don`t you just love the robot -design by Chris Halls(or Cunningham). Considering that it was made 10 years ago it`s in every way far more exiting to watch than forexample any of those animated crappy bluescreenmuppets in the new episodes(1-3) of star wars.
0321334876|5.0|This is the type of book that should be available to every programming professional in any programming language...  Effective C++ Third Edition by Scott Meyers (Addison-Wesley).<br /><br />Chapter List: Accustoming Yourself to C++; Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment Operators; Resource Management; Designs and Declarations; Implementations; Inheritance and Object-Oriented Design; Templates and Generic Programming; Customizing new and delete; Miscellany; Beyond Effective C++; Item Mappings Between Second and Third Edition; Index<br /><br />Before we go too much further here, let's have some full disclosure here...  I'm not a C++ programmer.  This leads to a logical question...  What am I doing reviewing a book on C++, then?  Well, I've been in IT for over 25 years and I am a professional software developer.  I also read a boatload of tech books each year, too.  As a result, I can usually tell if a book is going to be worth the money and if it will deliver on the promises it makes.  This one does.<br /><br />If you look at all the Amazon reviews for the second edition of this book, you'll see that everyone agrees it is excellent material.  I'll assume the technical information in this edition is just as good.  Beyond that, there's a lot to like about the style here.  Meyers doesn't attempt to \\"teach\\" the language.  He assumes you know the fundamentals.  His items are focused on how to better understand a particular feature or concept so that you'll be more effective as a developer (hence the title).  The writing style is very readable, so it's easy to pick up the concepts between that and the code examples.  Something that I found really unique and useful is pretty minor but it works so well.  Relevant code and the \\"Things To Remember\\" recap at the end of each item are in red text.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it makes a world of difference in having your eyes drawn to that which is most important.  Considering most programming books are black and white, a dash of red really stands out.<br /><br />If you're a C++ developer with some experience under your belt, this really is the next book you need to take your development to the next level.  The people who maintain your code after you and the people who use your programs will thank you.hite, a dash of red really stands out. <br /> <br />If you're a C++ developer with some experience under your belt, this really is the next book you need to take your development to the next level.

B0000DJZA0|4.0|Overall their albums are better. I want to see this band live but I have a feeling their more of an album band instead of a live act. Its very mellow. Sometimes too mellow. However each song is great.
B00000IQV6|1.0|People were hung at Nuremburg for less than this crime against humanity. I found it addictively appalling, in its cringingly predictable and patronising plot, script, music and Robin Williams playing his usual so-brilliant-he's-nearly-insane-but-wacky-and-all-too-humane schtick.  <br />And then the only fit woman gets murdered and it's all over ickily washed over in about 5 minutes, while Adams gets off a medicine-no-licence rap (aside from theft of hospital supplies) with some illogical rant to the gallery. Evil that got one star off me only so I could post it.  <br />
B0000508U6|5.0|A great album is like this where every song is great from start to finish. This album has the perfect amount of songs and never gets boring. This band is very talented. I actually like them better then Radiohead.
B0002S94OS|4.0|just so you get my bearing, i listen to real metal (Judas Priest, Venom, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Megadeth....) this is good 'modern thrash' some parts comparable to classic Rust In Peace riffs (Megadeth), i wont lie. but listen kids, stop pretending to make Lamb Of God a f***ing hardcore band. they arent, they are more thrash than anything. (they dont do all the gay hardcore riff cliches and screams/singing, ie Shadows Fall, Unearth) and stop comparing them to Killswitch Engage! (KsE is way more girl-oriented, listen to the 'clean vocals') they DONT sound the same, just because girls like both doesnt mean they are the same kind of music. if your favorite bands are Lamb Of God AND Killswitch Engage (or any new 'metalcore') then do the real metal world a favor and stop listening to LoG.

B0007TKH66|1.0|The latest incarnation of Star Trek devised by producers/writers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, this show promises a lot, as did Voyager, but never delivers.  These writers are so dedicated to a cynical view of what the audience wants and are so formulaic and uninventive in their approaches that this show is just as dumbed-down as Voyager, always heading toward unsuccessful action-oriented and suspenseful scenes to avoid significant character development;  and when character exploration is done, it's so awfully clichd that it stinks of superficiality and remains unmoving.    Back in 1997, Berman was quoted in TV Guide as admiring the awful \\"Hercules\\" series, which essentially took the \\"Baywatch\\" premise and added bad action sequences and worse drama.  He said he wanted Star Trek to attract that audience.  So, in that year, Voyager brought in the curvacious Jeri Ryan (who's actually a good actor) in tight-fitting clothing -- so tight she fainted at times.  This became Star Trek's new mission:  appealing to people's pornographic desires in the guise of bad stories set in space.  Even some of the actors and writers started to speak out about how uninspiring it was to work on Star Trek Voyager.    This same writing/producing duo went on to create \\"Enterprise\\", along with a cheesy, soft-pop intro to win over the stereotypically unintelligent WB-type youth demographic.  The first episode saw them apply a disinfectant ointment on Jolene Blalock's slinky bikini-and-panty-clad body;  over the years there were so many instances of using Blalock's body, I couldn't tell you about them -- mostly because I couldn't continue watching this awful show;  the latest incarnation of which I know (since, like a hopeful fool, I gave the show another chance in season 3, when most shows get a lot better) was Blalock naked and topless holding her bosoms in hand asking another officer to massage her, while she moaned orgasmically.  This all is decent soft porn, but not what the audience should expect from \\"Star Trek\\".  Now, to the actor's credit, she very much resented being used like this and protested the writers' intentions.    Even TNG saw a significant dumbing down in its later years, as Berman took over.  Any Star Trek story in which these two were significantly involved was always bound to stem from cynical calculations rather than the potential to write as good a story as was possible.  See, for example, all the Next Generation movies;  now, compare those to Star Trek 1 through 4, and you''ll see what I mean.    Now, there is a happy ending to this depressing tale of Star Trek's decline, and that is \\"Deep Space Nine\\" (1993-1999), which remained largely out of these writers' grasp.  During its run, the show was mostly guided by Michael Pillar and the ingenius Ira Steven Behr, who -- along with some great writers -- always tried to make the show the best they could, and succeeded in creating something amazing by Season 4.  When action was done, it was always exciting, too, propped up by great drama, often brilliant comedy, and fantastic secondary and primary characters.    (...)
1932100385|5.0|The China study is the most important book on nutrition and health to come out in the last 75 years. Everyone should read it and it should be the model for all nutrition programs taught at universities.  The reading is engrossing if not astounding. The science is conclusive. Dr. Campbell's intregrity and commitment to truthful nutrition education shine through. I interviewed him yesterday and found him to be a warm, genuinely brilliant scientist and humanitarian who speaks only about the real facts. The science is clearly consulsive: the best diet for humans is the vegan diet. Vegan diet stops and reverses most diseases, rejueventes, slims the body and stops the needless slaughter of animals and ravaging effects of animal farming. Learn why vegan foods are nutritionally complete and how the US government and AMA have abused our trust, perverting the truth about nutrition all in the name of profiteering. Dr. Campbell is a hero who deserves our serious attention. <br /> <br />David Klein <br />Publisher/Editor of Living Nutrition Magazine  <br />Sebastopol, California
B00005JNQQ|3.0|Perhaps I'm spoiled by all of the wonderful Pixar flicks, but \\"Robots\\" just doesn't hold up too well when compared to them.  The story is fine, but it seems to be spread a little thin in this flick.  Our hero, Rodney Copperbottom, leaves Rivettown for the big city to become an inventor and eventually repair his overworked and underappreciated father.  When he reaches Robot City, he finds a great company that has been overrun by corruption and greed by the spoiled crybaby, Ratchet, who's helping his mother take control of the city.  From there, we are offered up a good mix of characters who help Rodney save the day.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor does a good job as Rodney, and Greg Kinnear was surprisingly good as Ratchet.  The rest of the cast did a fine job, but the glaring letdown was the performance of Robin Williams as Fender, Rodney's comical sidekick.  Having voiced the genie in \\"Aladdin,\\" you'd expect more of the same from Williams, but his delivery is flat and overshadowed by the other robots in the flick.<br /><br />I don't recall any bad words in the film.  In fact, they're covered up with words like \\"scrap.\\"<br /><br />The animation is pretty good, but those spoiled by \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"A Bug's Life\\" will be left wanting more.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film.  It will never achieve the status of fellow Pixar outsiders like \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Ice Age,\\" but it is a good film to have in your library if for no other reason to appreciate the animation for what it is and the performances of Ewan McGregor and Kinnear.<br /><br />Also, listen for a cameo by one of the best voices around, James Earl Jones.
B00049QQHI|5.0|I don't care what people say about DiCapiro, the lad is a fu*kin great actor. The Basketball Diaries is great for three things... The way its told, The New York Neighbourhood sets, the savage acting. <br />The voice over in the film really drags you down into the world of a junkie. The slow empty boring world. (To me its like sitting in on a wet sunday knowing school is the next day...that horrible dragging out feeling, knowing that you have to go to school the next day and hating it, and the whole day reminding yourself of the homework that has to be done and your trying to sit yourelf down to do it , but you couldn't be arsed.) Thats the feeling of a junkie on a daily basis, sitting himself down to stop his addiction but he knows he is going to have the next day to go through....just picture that horrible feeling... every day
038533348X|4.0|In style and reader engagement \\"Cat's Cradle\\" has held up very well over the last 5 decades. Vonnegut was undoubtedly an original writer with a sharp wit. He manages to constrain the characters (narrator excepted) within the two-dimensional paper dolls expected of satire while running a thread of mystery through each. Even the awkwardly shallow Mrs. Crosby has a line or two that give us pause.<br /><br />Nevertheless, both Vonnegut and the mysterious Caribbean guru of his creation preface their words repeatedly with an explicit warning not to take any of it seriously. This clouds the book's foggy voyage to deep meaning. Typical Vonnegut fans seem to brush aside the self-effacement as sardonically clever when granting high accolades, but accept a paradox when taking his deconstructionist ideas to heart . Does anyone really \\"get\\" Vonnegut's message, or is he inwardly laughing at those gullible enough to ignore it? Does the emperor have no clothes?<br /><br />Someone else's comparison between Bokononism and Scientology struck an agreeable chord. Both are obviously the figment of a modern mind and seek to reorder human psychology across cultural boundaries, alluding only to vague cosmological bases. Of course Hubbard was real and institutionalized, but either belief system could fill a spiritual longing unmet by the weekly grind of the church routine when the clergy loses touch with people or rebellion seeks an outlet. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" might capture the hearts of an audience in that delicate stage of personal growth when one begins to question the beliefs of their parents and community, but hasn't the knowledge or courage to study the more robust and well-established alternatives closely. It is a fine book with amusingly honest observations on the plight of humanity, but I sincerely hope people come to understand that satirical pop philosophy and the serious masterworks of world literature have distinct literary forms and ends.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain was a astonishing and fun movie. I especialy enjoyed the lovely scenery and the special effects. I also endoyed the acting. <br /> <br />My only problem was the romance between Paltrow and Law. Through most of the movie all they did was argue with each other, curse each other, and smack each other. <br /> <br />All in all, Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow is an excellent movie which I think many can enjoy.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|With the recent revival of movie musicals in Hollywood (Moulin Rouge!, Chicago), it seemed inevitable that eventually, a big-name composer and a big-name director would try to convert a big-name Broadway musical to film. Sure enough, Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, a Joel Schumacher film, opened in select cities on December 22.  <br /> <br />A quick note: If you don't like musical theatre, or if you've seen Phantom on Broadway and hated it, or if you think Andrew Lloyd Webber should be tried for crimes against humanity because of his music...I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you're not going to be crazy about this adaptation. However, if you're not in that particular category of people (and I hope you're not), then I'm willing to bet that you'll like this movie.  <br /> <br />If you're not familiar with the stage show, here's a quick summary of the story: Christine Daa is a young ingnue at the Paris Opera House. She's been taking music lessons from an unseen master who is referred to by the dancers as the \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" The Phantom is actually a disfigured man who lives beneath the opera house, and is...well, a little psychotic. The Phantom is in love with Christine, and while she feels a very strong attraction towards him, she's also in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raoul. The majority of the movie details the Phantom's growing obsession with Christine and the lengths he'll go to make her love him back.  <br /> <br />I adored this movie. I think the story and the music transferred brilliantly from stage to screen. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher made some excellent decisions regarding the plot-although there are some major changes from the stage version, the result is a simply brilliant film adaptation. Fans and critics have been especially divided over the director's choice of casting, so I'll take a few minutes to discuss the three principal characters: the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul.  <br /> <br />Gerard Butler (Dracula 2000, Timeline) plays the title character. His performance has spurred more heated discussions and arguments among fans than any other actor in the movie-mostly because he's not a classically trained singer, and his voice has a much rougher edge to it than most of the actors who have played the Phantom on Broadway. However, Butler is a stupendous actor and manages to convey the Phantom's pain and loneliness more effectively than any stage actor I've ever seen. And his untrained voice actually complements that raw pain and emotion.  <br /> <br />Christine is played by Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow, Mystic River). Rossum shows off a lovely soprano voice in the film. She's a little weak on some of the higher notes, but she's young, and her voice hasn't fully developed yet. Her acting, however, is excellent. She's consistently able to portray her conflicting fear and desire for the Phantom, and she seems genuinely torn between the Phantom and Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson.  <br /> <br />Wilson (Angels in America) was the first principal cast for the movie-and with good reason. He has a lovely voice, and he manages to give real depth to the normally thankless role of Raoul.  <br /> <br />Phantom also has a wonderful supporting cast. Special recognition, however, should go to Minnie Driver, who plays the opera diva, Carlotta. Her performance is hilarious, completely over-the-top, and thoroughly enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Beyond the individual performances, the music is beautiful (the singers are backed by a 100-piece orchestra, which you'll never get in live theatre), the sets are breathtaking, and the costumes are absolutely stunning. The eye and ear candy alone make this DVD worth buying, but the special features are also a lot of fun.  I just wish they had included a running commentary.

B00000HYXB|5.0|I first heard this album in 1999 (jap import version) and was not initially impressed (the style was too different for me at the time).  My style at the time was Iron Maiden and older Metallica.  But then one day, it happened.  My brother was playing this album again, and I was humming the tune to \\"Time Stands Still\\".  I bought the CD.  Before I knew it this was my Absolute Favorite CD by any band.  It grew on me big time and now in 2005, it is still my most played CD after 5+ years.   <br /> <br />Songs Of Significance:  \\"Nightfall\\", \\"Curse Of Feanor\\", \\"Time Stands Still\\" and \\"Thorns\\" are my absolute favorites.  \\"Mirror Mirror\\" is the closest to 'pop-metal' style and is the catchiest if you wanna try to get into the new style of music, or...in my case, get my total Metal-Hating friends into the music slowly.  One of my friends, who then hated everything I had played, now has the song \\"Nightfall\\" as one of his all-time favorites. <br /> <br />I'm not great at writing music reviews, but I will say this, if you do give this Album a try, please give it a few before making an opinion.  you may find, as I did, it can grow strongly on you.  The storyline follows that of JRR Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillian\\" in part.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Horror films, and particularly the zombie movie, are often the site of young filmmakers first chance to make a 'real' movie.  Following in this tradition, Pegg, Wright, et al. have produced a film so lovingly packed with references to their heroes (who themselves often started with allusion laden genre films) that it is impossible not to get swept up in the enthusiasm.    This reveling in the history of genre films themselves is one sort of youthful excess, a thankful antidote to the transgressive, angry Beavis and Butthead style excess that characterized first-time director Zack Snyder's heartless \\"Dawn of the Dead Remake.\\"  Pegg and Wright love talking about movies the way great novelists love talking about books and it shows throughout \\"Shaun.\\"    That said, the scripting is so deft that it's hard to say once and for all if this is a zombie movie with a romantic comedy glued on top, or a romantic comedy with Zombies stapled on.  Part of this is because the film is as much about London as it is about scares.  The drab, listless lifestyles of early thirty-something Londoners is so much a part of the story that it can be enjoyed as much as a movie about a place and time (England in the dreary nineties) as about a group of characters (the standard rom-com archetypes: hapless boyfriend, impatient girlfriend, obnoxious best friend, ancillary 'married couple', etc.).  That the film can be enjoyed by 'blokes' and their girlfriends equally and for completely different reasons tells of just how lucky fans of genre films are to be visited by this crew, even if it's just this once.    The performances are all stellar.  There is not a line delivered by Bill Nighy or Dylan Moran that is not dripping with the sort of drollery usually reserved for Mankiewicz dialog.  Pegg displays the most lovable sort of spastic-faced English comic delivery and Nick Frost is the most adorable galut I've seen on film in a long time.  Even the extras and one-line performers are pitch perfect, credit casting or directing or both.    The soundtrack is an amazing array of remixes touching on Zombie film lore, eighties electro notalgia, video game scores, and indy consciousness.    This is as much of a must see for fans of horror films as Stephen Chow's \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is for fans of marital arts movies, or as \\"Imitation of Life\\" is for fans of melodrama.  It's so good, in fact, that by the end it becomes a homage to itself.
B00005JM8V|5.0|I am about to buy this DVD. I watched this \\"documentary\\" about a dozen years ago and have not viewed it since. It has lived with me all these years and often comes to mind. This \\"documentary\\" belongs in a category of its own. It is more a human experience than a work of documentary art.<br /><br />I first viewed Shoah when I was off sick from work. I was recovering from minor surgery that left me immobilized for several days. I rented the entire film and began to watch it over several consecutive days.<br /><br />For the first hour or so (yes, a long time for most films) I was not really engaged by what I was hearing and seeing. The structure is so simple it borders on boredom. Where many films create \\"noise\\" this is not what this subject deserves. With little to distract, the words you hear will pierce the deepest recesses of your being.<br /><br />Watching and listening I was drawn in by the voices and the cuts from scenery to speaker and back. What you see is not the horrific scenery you might conjure up of sites where the darkest evils took place, but scenes of nature as it would have been and as it is every day, now and then. After all, the darkness of evil is internal.<br /><br />Try hard to keep watching, do not turn away, and you will change forever. But be prepared emotionally. Like others that have watched this, I wept throughout, it would be hard not to. This is not entertainment and it rises about art. Viewing this film results in a very powerful human experience that will stay with you for the remainder of your life.

I hope she is happy with these songs and her current style, but I will never buy another Mariah CD unless she goes back to making beautiful music.
1592400876|2.0|The popularity of this book is a testament to the madness of crowds. It would be flattery to say that it is merely tedious. It is repetitive (one or two weak examples come up again and again) and is poorly edited (many paragraphs contain several unrelated ideas). <br /> <br />This book is no substitute for learning how to write well. Indeed, although the author may know her punctuation (or at least she knows what she likes) the book is unreadable. The following sentence is an exemplar of what passes for prose in this book: \\"To me a subordinate clause will for ever (sic) be (since I heard the actor Martin Jarvis describe it thus) one of Santa's little helpers.\\" Eh? <br /> <br />This is the sort of book that someone pretentious is likely to give you as a gift. Plan to \\"re-gift\\" it to someone you don't like.

The story doesn't intrique me. The energetic musical style that pervades the whole thing is irritating. It's like they're contstantly trying to reassure the kids that nothing really bad is going to happen with musical cues and just the whole style. I find my attention wandering.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I have only been on the Marillion bandwagon for about 4-1/2 years now, and I have to say that this CD exceeds even Brave, which was my all-time favorite. I also own the Marbles on Tour DVD, and after learning that the band worked on this release for over 2 years, the results speak for themselves. Something about Marillion reminds me of what might result if Roger Hodgsen of Supertramp was plunked into Pink Floyd. Imagine emotional, plaintive singing along with Steve Hackett/David Gilmour-ish guitar from Steve Rothery, keyboard stylings not dissimilar to Richard Wright of Pink Floyd, plus some unique intangibles found only with Marillion, and you have a pretty good picture of where they're at right now.<br /><br /> Every track on this wonderful CD is top-rate, even the oft-maligned \\"Drilling Holes\\", which has a certain charm unique to this song. Overall (and as of this writing), my favorite tracks would have to be \\"Fantastic Place\\", \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\", \\"Neverland\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", and \\"You're Gone\\". There isn't a single disappointment here, and I wait with bated breath for the next release, however long it takes!
0385513755|4.0|Dan Brown presents a highly controversial theory in this book. He writes a story centering on Jesus Christ and the church.  The characters in The Da Vinci Code are on a long, risky scavenger hunt searching for the long kept secret of an undercover society. This special illustrated edition of the Da Vinci Code has many vivid color pictures of the items and places that the characters are searching for.  It is very helpful to have the pictures for reference.<br /><br />The story begins like any other murder mystery. Brown begins the book with the murder of a prominent Louvre curator. Robert Langdon, a prominent symbologist, and Sophie Neveu, the victim's grand daughter, attempt to find the killer. They never expect to find so many puzzles and clues leading up to such an unimaginable secret kept by an undercover society, the Priory of Scion, composed of some of the most famous men in history. The most prominent member of this society was Leonardo Da Vinci who hid the secret in his painting, The Last Supper.<br /><br />This book presented the topic in the form of an exciting and controversial novel. Furthermore, more people than ever are discussing the big secret supposedly covered up by the Church. Many other books have been published explaining the facts and misconceptions presented in The Da Vinci Code. There have even been television specials and soon there will be a major motion picture. The movie is expected to be a blockbuster (Tom Hanks has been cast to play the lead role.) Even if everything in the book is false, Dan Brown has made it seem believable. What makes this book so widely debated is the way that Brown seamlessly combines fact and fiction to write a highly believable yet controversial novel. It has been on the bestseller's list since its debut.  Even though Dan Brown's theory may never be proven to be true, he has certainly created doubt in the minds of many. Brown has turned a theory into a bestselling novel. He has turned fiction into the believable. If you like The Da Vinci Code, you may also like Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. It is the prequel to The Da Vinci Code. Robert Langdon is on another chase for the truth in that book.he Da Vinci Code, you may also like Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.

B0006A9FKA|2.0|I'll admit that I wanted to like this movie , but no matter how hard I tried, it just failed to impress. The real crackers here are very sparse or perhaps non-existent - the majority of the film consists of episodes that seem to hint at something funny but leave you wondering \\"Was I supposed to laugh?\\" . It appears to be the type of movie that aims to appeal to \\"mature\\" audiences but instead seems to be capable of impressing only 5-year old kids with obtrusive swearing and cheesy zombie action. I mean, c'mon, when that guy Pete inserts f**k after every word he speaks , is that supposed to actually make you laugh? On a side-note, I expected to see a lot more piss-takes on the original horror classic but there were few. Anyway, I cant see why people like film so much. Maybe because it's different, but even so, it's different in a very bad way. I strongly suggest you avoid this - even the pity that \\"loser\\" Shawn might be able to pull out of you wont save this crap.t
0553106635|5.0|There's no need to tell people how good this series has been...each review I've read goes on and on about how good the plot, characters, etc... are and they are all true.  The one thing that I have read in these reviews is that you may want to wait until the fifth book comes out (as there are six slated to be written) so that you don't have to wait that long to get the gratification of reading the ending of the story.  I started reading this series after Jordan wrote crossroads of the twilight because I had nothing else to read and Borders had a little sign by Jordan's books saying \\"if you liked the WoT then try George R.R. Martin\\".  All have have to say is THANK YOU Borders, because Martin is about 10 times the writer that Jordan is and I'm glad that I started reading the series when I did.  The stories are fantastic and I enjoy re-reading them as much as I enjoyed reading them the first time.  So don't wait years to pick up this series just because it's only half written.
B00008PC2O|5.0|The T2 Extreme edition bonus disc has the theatrical version of the film encoded in High Definition (HD) using the windows media series 9 codec.  This encoding looks brilliant and is far superior to the normal DVD on direct comparison.  It must be played by a Windows computer and requirtes a 500K patch for windows media 10 users.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately,it also requires you use the included InterActual DVD player to play the protected content.  That DVD player sucks, but is usable. My problem with it is it would exit out of full screen if I tried to use my KVM, so I had to put down the mouse to watch the movie. Another small issue is that, due to the DVD format, the movie was broken into 2GB segments (4 in all) and there was a 3 - 10 second delay whenever it loaded a new segment.  No big deal. <br /> <br />The encoding looks brilliant on my 1280 x 1024 flat panel monitor (presumably 720p) but it appears as though the encoding is even higher, perhaps 1080.  It played relatively stutter-free on my 2.4ghz Dell desktop w/ 512MB RAM and an NVIDIA 5700 fx ultra 128MB video card.  I should note that I couldn't get interactual to install on my other computer (and was therefore unable to watch the content on that computer) due to it's inability to \\"initialize the audio subsystem.\\"  I didn't particularly troubleshoot this though. <br /> <br />So, for those of you out there that are sick of waiting for HD to get out of the realm of only broadcast TV (where it's not available to so many) and simply can't wait for the HD DVD to be accepted, manufactured and flooded with re-releases, then WMVHD (Windows Media Version High Definition) is for you.  There are ~10 titles out in the format now and they can be previewed at wmvhd.com.  Most of them are IMAX films.   <br /> <br />I want more releases on WMV! I'm addicted to HD and can't get it anywhere yet! Only on the bonus disc of T2 Extreme Edition. <br />

B00004XONN|5.0|There are recordings that just sound better in the dark, perhaps when you've come out from passing out the night before in the middle of the night. Maybe you had an incredible evening with a lover...or just broke up with one, your mind in pieces from grief. An album like this is perfect for times when you just want to be quiet inside and ---listen---. Amazing, highly original, atmospheric, electronic rock. Same can be said for the follow-up, \\"Amnesiac\\".
B0007TKNKG|3.0|remember in the movie hawk declined $250000 or something like that when mike's granddaddy offered him to take the money plus truck and leave to start a new life, when hawk declined i lost interest in this movie, because no person in his right mind would deny it, at least in this country. the only thing that talks in america - you guessed right money. i would take it and have a nice day mike, hahahaha, better is to kiss up with grandfather and live off his income then to drive stinking truck day and night.  i mean guy owns 747 plain and each time its over 10 miles long he flies it.  hawk is an idiot, with father in law like that you can go places. i would be living in his house eat, sleep, work out, drive a ferrari, go to europe and let him take care of my son. now how bad could it be, let granddaddy handle the spoiled brat.  and after grandaddy is old he would leave it all to me or my son who would think that i love him so much. oh boy life in luxury. hey don't fool yourself you would do the same, because if not you are not teh true american as i'm.

You have to be willing to get through a lot of name dropping, descriptions of how cool the author is and overly detailed stories of things he has done (which are usually, but not always, related to the topic in hand) but there are a lot of great ideas and tips in here.  He even explains, for the socially retarded, how to run a dinner party step-by-step!

B000002J2B|5.0|After Peter Gabriel left Genesis with the landmark album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Genesis, now headed by Phil Collins, wanted to show that they could still produce ethereal rock with misty landscapes and long story-telling. Winds and the Wuthering, which followed The Trick of the Tail, showed that for two albums in a row they could do quite fine without Gabriel. Winds and the Wuthering features their spiritual hymn \\"Afterglow,\\" its melancholy lament \\"Blood on the Rooftops,\\" and their love ballad \\"Your Own Special Way,\\" and the album as a whole confirms that they continued to make a smooth transition from their Peter Gabriel days. Don't be fooled by Phil Collins' pop idol reputation. Before he went solo, he created an entirely different world with a voice that seems totally Other than it does pop. At times his voice reminds me of a munchkin or a gnome. I mean this in a good sense. His other-worldly voice seems to complement the fairy-tale atmosphere.
B000059R8Y|2.0|IF YOU LIKE POP AND LOUNGE ACTS, YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS CD. <br /> <br />Eric Clapton is at his best when he is playing the blues or blues flavored rock.  He is at his worst when he is trying to be someone else. His worst CD was August when he tried to do Phil Collins. On this CD, he is trying to be James Taylor, George Benson and a washed up Las Vegas loung act. <br /> <br />There are some great songs on this CD, but they are the blues numbers, Come Back Baby and I Want a Little Girl.  Also, his rocker Superman Inside is fairly good. <br /> <br />From there, things go downhill.  Much of the music is overproduced.  Especially bad is the background vocals that ruin many of the songs.   <br /> <br />On this CD is yet another JJ Cale song, Travelin' Light.  Clapton does a fairly nice job of it, except that it is one of the songs ruined by horrible background vocals.  There is a repeat of the word \\"Light\\", everytime it is sung.  It just sounds goofy.   This is at least the third JJ Cale song Clapton has done.  Maybe he was searching for another hit.  He hit gold with the other two JJ Cale songs he did, After Midnight and Cocaine. <br /> <br />Got You On My Mind is another example of an overproduced song.  It is a nice blues number, but played too upbeat.  Clapton sings \\"I'm feeling sad and low\\" to bouncing beat.  He sure doesn't sound sad and low. <br /> <br />A number of the songs have strings, and background harmoines that are out of place.  Probably the worst thing on this CD is the James Taylor song, Don't Let Me Lonely Tonight. They all sound like songs James Taylor would do as a washed up Las Vegas act. <br /> <br />The CD starts and ends with acoustic guitar numbers.  They remind of George Benson, only not as good.  They a nice little instrumentals, but they are fairly bland, with no emotion.   <br /> <br />Except for a few songs, this is really a bland album.  But, many people like that kind of music, just like many people like white bread.  He continues this emotionally flat style on the live album One More Car, One More Rider.
0156421178|5.0|I was surprised when I read this little known Orwell gem to find that it is in many ways superior to 1984 and Animal Farm. For one thing it is an absolutely first rate account of the Spanish Civil War which is a difficult subject to apprehend because of the massive propoganda of the party literature, as Orwell notes in the text. Some may find the more strictly political sections a bit tedious (Orwell actually warns the reader about such segments) to get through, but for those interested in the politics of the revolution they are intelligently expressed and carefully put together. But Homage to Catalonia is such an amazing and complex blend of everything Orwell; it is a deeply human and observant depiction of war and struggle, it is a political document, a scathing assesment of power and manipulation, and a satirical commentary on the follies of war.  Why this over-looked classic is not mentioned in the same breath as 1984 and Animal Farm is beyond me.
B0007GADZO|2.0|I'm sorry to say, I was a huge fan of Vai, but not any more. I'm just tired. I can't listen anymore to the same recipes of the same songs played using different scales and tempos.

There are a couple of nice things here and there. But probably nothing more than that.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|This 2004 film is about the writer of the beloved tale of Peter Pan.  Johnny Depp is cast in the lead role of Sir James Barrie, a married London playwright whose career is failing.  However, when he meets a young widow, played by Kate Winslet, and her four young boys, he becomes a friend of that family, much to the displeasure of his own wife as well as the widow's mother, played by Julie Christie.  These are fine roles for all of them.  And the story held my interest.  However, even though the film is set in 1903, I couldn't help viewing it through modern eyes.  And basically, I feel repugnance for a man who just can't grow up, loves to play with children as if he is one of them, and finds his greatest happiness when he is doing just that.  Even the name \\"Neverland\\" is a turn-off for me.<br /><br />Personal views aside though, I did enjoy the costumes and sets of the period.  I also thought the performances were excellent.  That's why I give this film a mild recommendation.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Being a relatively new fan of their music, I became quickly to admire Slipknot because of their creativity, diversity, and \\"constructive-ness\\".  Having nine members allows them to push the envelope futher than most groups can, and Vol.3 is no exception.    Since Slipknot's debut album, they have changed quite a bit, varying styles and moods through their self-titled debut, then Iowa, and now Vol.3, but nonetheless retain their pulse-pounding, gut-wrenching force through almost every last song.  One thing that Vol.3 possesses however, that Iowa and  their debut album do not quite share, is a sense of completion.  Whereas Iowa and \\"Slipknot\\" are excellent albums, they lack a sense of target, leaping from 3-minute metal \\"slam\\" sessions to semi-melodic strikes; and Vol.3 seems to be mroe of a mature album in the sense that it hits more on target of a complete, clear, and consise goal, yet keeps it diversity just like all of the other albums.  From the rap-metal thrash of \\"Duality\\" to the melodramatic ballads \\"Circle\\" and \\"Vermilion Pt.2\\", to the rhythmic bombs \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" and the \\"The Blister Exists\\", Slipknot is still here, and here to stay.   <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album is packed with popular songs that have made Britney Spears into the superstar she is today. <br /> <br />Despite her critics, Britney goes from strength to strength as her career rolls on and on. The proof is in the pudding. The fact her non-fans have to go out of their way and shout from the rooftops trying to convince themselves she's a fading star proves her star is still burning brightly. <br /> <br />She began recording for Jive records in 1998 and her debut single \\"Baby One more time\\" not only topped the America charts, nor did it only reach #1 the world over, it also became the best selling single the label ever had. Soon after her debut album became the best selling album they ever had and then she went on to become officially the all-time #1 selling artist on the Jive label. <br /> <br />All Five of her albums (\\"Britney,\\" \\"Baby, One More Time,\\" \\"Oops, I did it again,\\" \\"In The Zone\\" and \\"Greatest Hit's\\") reached the top on Jive's weekly selling catalogue chart and four of them also went all the way to #1 in the national charts too. <br /> <br />This album is a summary of her hit singles. Highlights include \\"Toxic,\\" \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Outrageous.\\"

0393035158|3.0|This book raises many controversial and interesting points, but suffers from numerous flaws. <br /> <br />The author asserts that there are 3 basic ways of perceiving the world:  mysticism (rely on direct experience without organizing constructs), science (use organizing constructs that can be tested and are abandoned if they fail repeatedly), and religion (use organizing constructs that are untestable or that are maintained without change no matter how badly they contradict observation).  Religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam rely on \\"revealed truth\\" that can be accepted only by suspending logical thought (such as a desire for evidence).  This uncritical acceptance of \\"revealed truth\\" leads inevitably to intolerance and, quite often, to oppression and violence.  Further, he says that religious \\"moderates\\" adapt to modern society only by selectively ignoring the parts of their holy books that are the most incompatible with functional modern society.  Given the abysmal nature of theocratic societies throughout history (1200 years of Christian theocracy in Europe, and modern Islamic theocracies in places like Afghanistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia), there is probably a lot of merit to the author's main thesis. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Mr. Harris delves into many questionable points that detract from his main message.  Example 1: He says that opposition to abortion and marijuana stem almost entirely from religious fanaticism, because it is obvious that a fetus is not a person and marijuana is harmless.  Hold on here!  I have known hardcore atheists who consider it self-evident that a fetus is a person.  Similarly, while one might be able to make a plausible argument for legalizing marijuana, it is not at all obvious that marijuana is harmless, or that opposition to marijuana is restricted to religious fanatics. <br /> <br />Example 2: He says that worldwide Muslim hatred for America is driven almost entirely by religious fanaticism and would persist no matter what US foreign policy was.  In reality, international polls of Muslims show strong distaste for American foreign policy (e.g., support for Israel, invasion of Iraq, coziness with unpopular dictators).  Moreover, Muslim terrorists have not attacked Western countries that have foreign policies that are less objectionable to Muslims, even though some of those countries (e.g., France, Sweden, the Netherlands) have domestic societies that are more offensive to Muslims than is America society.  I am not claiming that Muslims are correct in their views on American foreign policy, but only that it influences their behavior.  Thus, given that Muslim terrorists have both political and religious objections to the United States, it is impossible to know what they would do in the absence of the political objections. <br /> <br />Example 3:  The author begins the book with a description of a suicide bombing on a bus.  He claims that we can conclude with near certainty that the suicide bomber was a Muslim.  NO!  While Muslim groups, in the aggregate, account for a majority of the world's suicide bombings, the number one suicide bomber group is the Marxist-Leninist Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka.  It may very well be that the Tamil Tigers are motivated by irrational beliefs that are held without evidence, but they are not driven by traditional religion.

First of all, the cover of the cd is really f*cking cool, second, the vocals sound really evil and dark and just cool, third the music is really good, and just everything about the album is great, anyone who likes black metal should own this, you cant call yourself a black metal fan if you dont own this.  I dont know if its the best from mayhem, but its my favorite, just becuase its my favorite doesnt mean its the best. My favorite songs on this cd are: Pagan Fears, Freezing Moon, and From The Dark Past.  If your a black metal fan, you already own, so if your wanting to get in to black metal, get this first.
B000005YZM|4.0|What's strange about this album is that it gets unfairly lumped into the whole \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"-\\"Pet Sounds\\" field, when it clearly provides no distinct resemblance to either. Whereas the \\"Pepper\\" seems to mostly center around the actual split amdidst the vision of the Beatles, and \\"Pet Sounds\\" shows the virtual totalitarianism of Brian Wilson reaching its zenith (few of the other \\"boys\\" played their instruments on the record or even sang leads) \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" is nostalgia and pastoralism, but not in the snot-nosed Ray Davies way. You simply can't deny the sheer force of organ and piano on this record, its everywhere; and even when its in the back it seems to be in the front; it drives nearly every track (re: \\"Brief Candles\\", \\"Rose for Emily\\" esp.). But as much as the twinkling ivories twinkle your eyes, the harmonies are what really make this album worth its salt. Everyone knows Colin Blunstones lead on \\"She's not There\\" as well they should, for how breathtaking it is, but the rest of the very alive Zombies could sing as well, if not with a tad less deadpan and more pathos. Its really harmony, harmony harmony on this record which may lead some newcomers to miss the real musicality behind the sweeping choral-like arrangements; be warned: these boys could write.  <br />I say, if you like any British music from this era buy this, but dont buy it for guitar. The Zombies, although the name may lead some to conjure up the Kinks, Stones or Animals, are not raucous, they have no real \\"grit\\", but if you like \\"She's leaving home enough to skip to it on the \\"Pepper\\", and if you can't get enough of \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" then certainly run out or click and buy this.

B000002NJS|5.0|1997 was a quiet year for Madonna. Evita was her first and only movie succes, but her single sales were going downhill since 1991. She re-invented herself several times and it didn't work. But after she got her baby Lourdes early 1998, she re-inevnted her music and look again and this time it was a huge succes. Madonna looked like a natural beauty with her long black/brown hair and her music was a huge succes. Ray Of Light went 4 times platinum in ths US and was a double platinum or more succes in almost every country. She released 6 singles which promoted the album and many awards (for example 4 grammys) helped promoting the album and singles. The Kaballah really helped Madonna! It cleaned her soul. <br /> <br />The album has got all the latest tunes and sounds fresh and modern. The songs are all longer then 4 minutes and the album includes 13 tracks. It's a large album album, with a running time of more then 150 minutes. The order of the track is well and Madonna's voice sounds amazing after her singing lessons for Evita. The album has a variation of songs, but the songs do match eachother. William Orbit and Madonna did an amazing job. The first part of the album includes some rock-pop songs and the second part is filled with ballads. It can be played at any time. <br /> <br />The titel track is a bouncy rock-pop dance song. Madonna sings really high. You will be surprised at first, but after more listenings you will love this song. It includes a lot of crazy sounds and tunes. Swim and Candy Perfume Girl are both mid-tempo rock-pop songs. Madonna is surprisingley good with soft rock. Mer Girl is a song without beats. It's just Madonna's voice and a melody at the background. The song has some special tunes, which gives this song a mysterious effect. It's a good way to end the album. Little Star is a song about her child. The Power Of Goodbye is the best ballad of the album. The flute created a special effect and the chorus is a classic one. Sky Fits Heaven has sometrance in it and can be played in a discotheque. The beats are amazing and the song is very, very catchy. Ashanti is a song other then the others. It is a geisha song in Kaballah language. It has a Chinese effect. The opening song Drowned World has very good lyrics, which is important for the whole album. <br /> <br />Well, is there anything bad about Ray Of Light? Of course, some things are less but there is nothing that really sucks. Madonna's best album without any doubt. You should buy this one, even if you hate madonna. It is pop, rock and trance and it includes very deep ballads and good lyrics. It sounds very new, like it is an album of 2020. This is almost the perfect album...
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Parker & Stone were hilarious with South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut and went over the top with profanity and attacks on celebrities and politicians.  Unfortunately, this film is technically creative with the puppets but otherwise an over the top experiment with crudeness and a very weak story.  The moments I found humorous were few and far between.  Caught myself falling asleep several times (despite coffee).  With all the hype this movie received, and the long delay before DVD release, I expected far more.  This one is going to the used bin.  Agreeing with other reviewers, this is definitely not a family film (not that I ever thought it was).
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Although it's a good thing that SOAD continue to grow and evolve as musicians, as is evident on Mezmerize, the style and direction they're going isn't really my personal preference.  They've gone to a more traditional, thrashy guitar playing style as opposed to their outbursts of chugga-chugga crunchy bouncey style that was prevalent on their first two CDs.  There are also more drawn out choruses on this album, some of which are a little too dramatic for my tastes.  There is also an obvious attempt to incorporate more middle-eastern flavored music into the album, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but again, not my preference.  I believe the first 3 songs on the album are pretty awesome and some of the best stuff the band has ever done, ie \\"BYOB\\", \\"Revenga\\" and the highly entertaining \\"Cigaro\\".  The second half of the CD kind of drags.  Listening to this CD makes me really appreciate their first self-titled CD even more.  Overall, I admire that the band is growing musically and changing their style, as change is essential for any band, but for me personally, I definately prefer their old style.  But having said that, SOAD is still one of the best alternative metal bands out there, and I'm anxiously awaiting the release of Hypnotize to see what these fine Armenian gentleman come up with next.

B000002KKC|5.0|Everyone thinks that the groundbreaking 'Rumours' is their best and most defined piece of work of this bands superstar and super long career but in 1979 they made an album that would enable the band to carry on and in-print their name in rock and roll history forever and change them forever.It was album that went againts what everyone wanted and expected and they merely didn't want to make a Rumours pt 2 so completely went againts the grain.Out came an experimental album that was born out of Lindsey Buckingham being inspired by the new wave of punk rock not musically but by doing something different.  All the 3 main songwriters get alot more material and voice on this album.Buckingham wrote 9 tracks , Nicks wrote 5 and Mcvie wrote 6 in the end there was 20 tracks huge in comparison with their previous 11 track albums.Made to fit a double album which is in part a reason why the album sold 9 million ( by double album standards pretty good) againts 'Rumours' 31 million and peaking at us # 4 after a 6 month spell at # 1 with 'Rumours' and just taking the UK # 1 spot and staying in the chart for 6 months when 'Rumours' spent 7 years in the chart.A commercial dissapointing maybe but not in anyway a professional one.  The main thing i notice about this album is it's more Stevie Nicks dominated.She has the less amount of songs but adds up to more running time than Buckingham or Mcvie.I think this is more representive of Nicks and her best work in her career.  Her songs:             SARA: One of her most soul baring, heart open and beautiful songs ever written.Alot of stories has been written about this song and it's meaning and influence.Origionally a 16 minute marathon song and eventually being cut down to 12 then 9 ( appears on The re:issue of the album in 2004) and then a 6 minute which appeared on the origional release and then a 4 minute version).Nicks firece about her music never liked the fact that they had to chop it up and cut it down and claims theres so many verses of the songs we've never  heard.   With Nicks tinkling detuned piano and backing harmony's runs along gorgeously why singing lines such as ' drowning in the sea of love' before eventually reaching a emotional end claiming 'like a heartbeat and it never really died'.All mystical sounding with harmonys all built around nicks distint vocals.         STORMS: One of my favourite tracks and one where just beautiful won't describe it.With a gentle electric guitar and of course their famous harmonys all again built around nicks singing of lost love in the metaphors of storms, seas and darkness.Even when she sings 'never have i been a blue calm sea,i've always been a storm' you can hear the storm approaching on the horizon.          SISTERS OF THE MOON: A very rock and roll song in the vein of 'Rhiannon' and suprisingly one of their most lowest placing singles in the US chart.With the distictive bass of John Mcvie and a beat by Fleetwood so addictive you find yourself hypnotised from start to finish.With Nicks oohs in the distance as she sings about the hypnotic character in the song suddenly leads to a thumping hard guitar solo from Buckingham.One of their heaviest songs.Hypnotically beautiful.         ANGEL:In the vein of 'Dreams'and probobly her most happy song here.Closest she came to capturing the mood of the 'Rumours'.         BEAUTIFUL CHILD: One of Nicks proclaimed favourites and a song to fully appreciate must be heard live.With again a tinkling piano that eventually leads to a thumping beat in the backgroung and Nicks stateing i'm not a child anymore,i'm tall enough to reach the stars'.Another ballad and one of her best songs she's ever written.I'd describe it as a rock lullaby.   Chritines songs have developed and matured.Gone are the playful stomping pop and rock songs of 'Don't Stop' and 'You Make Loving Fun' and out comes jazz tinged chocolate covered treats if you will.   Her strongest songs here are 'BROWN EYES' with its over layers (which their famous for) to get their hypnotic 'Sha la la' layered over the chrous and wound round over a didstictive Fleetwood drumming sequence.Also Peter Green makes an appearence at the end even with just a few chords played makes the song and sounds haunting.   'Think About Me' is the closest thing you get to any 'Say You Love Me' and 'Don't Stop' with a stopping drumline and her distictive piano it's very Elton John.'Honey Hi' is pretty much an acoustic track with just an acoustic guitar and a few bongo drums plays at a nice pace and is one of the cheerful songs here.'Over and Over' kicks the album off with an electric piano and a slide guitar it plays beautifully.Two of the weakest tracks on the album is 'Never Forget' and 'Never Make Me cry' written by Mcvie and really don't go anywhere or catch the listeners ear as they tend to plod.Mcvie would eventually on the bands next set of albums go back into the vein of her previous pop stompers which is good but i think if she had built on the style of 'Brown Eyes' and mixed things up a little bit who knows what we could have had and may even become at least slightly hypnotic in her next attempts as Nicks has manged to do on all her solo and fleetwood releases.   Buckingham's songs are in  words short.'The Ledge' counts at just over 2 minutes and 'That's Enough For Me' clocks in at under 2 minutes.They are clear proof of Buckinghams attempt to go againts the grain and his admiration of the punk bands and probobly the closest Fleetwood Mac have ever come to 'Punk Rock'.With the fast drumming beats.slashing guitars and fast vocals they end as soon as they begin.  'That's All For Everyone' is a Pet Sounds era of The Beach boys treat. The title track and a total highlight here is where you can see the drugs went and where the proof is that when Buckingham had an idead her and the band set about doing it on the largest scale and the most difficult way.   'Tusk' featuring the  California marching trojan band has one of the most distictive beats ever recorded in rock music.It all resembles a heard of elephants (hence the title) with Mick Fleetwoods thumping continous drumming on a loop all the way throught the song and Lindsey's wild 'dont say that you love' and 'ahh he' run all through the song until the whole band congrate for the chorus with the branding or more like the shouting of 'TUSK' as the band strikes up and the trumpets blare out and you can practically hear the elephants marching the drummers drumming and every member of the Marching band marching around the dodgers stadium where it was recorded.It all leads to a epic explosion that leaves you  thinking 'where the hell did that come from' before playing it again to see if you had to witnessed it. A song so good its too good to be true.     Classed as one of the most expensive albums in rock history (even though Lindsey used kleenex boxes as drums )and one of the most anticipted in rock history it's both unexpected and hard to get into at first.It takes a while for each song to shine but i promise you after a few listens you will be hooked.Even the cover goes againts trends and expectations with a dotted and speckled backdrop with a dog chewing a mans  touser leg many believe it's this cover that counted towards it's commercial dissapointment but shouldn't the music be the thing that speaks the loudest as thats's why their here.Many wanted Nicks twirling or the band as with previous albums.Tango In The Night again had a picture of a jungle on it's cover and that did better here than in America.Maybe the Americans don't like change or difference.  It's a shame alot of the songs dont make the concert set lists anymore.Nicks proclaimed 'Sara' was never one for the stage it didn't transpire over very easily and hence why it hasn't really been performed since the Tusk tour even though it was a big American hit ( # 7).Only lately her song 'Beautiful Child'has made the set list on their 'Say You Will' tour and even Nicks herself claimed ' i never thought they'd let me perform it in concert' only the title track 'Tusk' is really performed.   I think thats a big shame as how is this album suppose to be officially claimed as the bands master piece when fans would rather be safe and feel safe with just 'the hits'all the time.I mean for every Rhiannon there's Sister Of The Moon and for every Don't Stop theres a Think About me.Mike Fleetwood claimed years after the albumm was released that it was his favourite Mac album and the album which enabled us to continue and grow and remain fresh.He was the man who origionally slated Buckingham and claimed he had blown it for them so you can see the effect the album has had over time-it just needed nurishment and age.    It's a satisfying, intriguing and a musically successful album that came as unexpected but now seems expected and dare i say it- normal but in the highest sense of the word.
B000001G1E|5.0|I looked at this boxed set over and over. Should I or Shouldn't I. Finally I bought it. I recently seen The Godfather of Soul in concert. At the age of 71-he was just totally fantastic. Since I have purchased this boxed set-I haven't stopped listening to it. Only one little disappointment tho! I wish as a personal request that he would have put Three Hearts in Tangle on the set instead of (do  the) mashed potatoes. But I won't complain. Are you thinking of puchasing this boxed set!! If your a JB' fan by all means buy it.Also give James Brown's Divas a go. That is also  a great buy. Especially &quot;Summertime&quot;               Kooch!
B000683VI4|5.0|I love the film. It was very inspiring, romantic and also somewhat poignant film. I have read the book and it made me cry. Very few people are capable of loving that way. Sadly, there are very few of them. I highly recommend the film for the romantics.
B000002G9S|5.0|the free was amongst the first supergroups of the sixties along with savoy brown,ten years after and cream.this is their best album along with tons of sobs and contains brilliant songs like heavy load,all right now,fire and water and mr bigs hugely recommended.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|(...)    I had high hops for this film during the opening credits. The rapid breathing of life into the decrepit opera house was spectacular and I felt my anticipation grow. The first musical number was superb. Minnie Driver had great character and the singer who performed Carlotta's singing was impeccable, hitting every note effortlessly. This immediately made me apprehensive, since it is Christine who is supposed to steal the show. My fears came true as soon as she opened her mouth. I'm not saying she doesn't have a fairly beautiful voice but I felt it was too thin, with not enough depth or force to give her that added oomph needed to take my breath away.  Carlotta outshines her in everyway. The actress, Ms Rossum seems incapable of pulling of a convincing performance. She didn't convey any emotion that made me care for her. Indeed I felt more annoyance. She waltzes though the film with the same deer in the headlights expression, with a fragility that make me want to push her over and watch her smash. The graveyard scene was ruined by very fake looking snow and unnecessary cleavage. I've said it before and I'll say it again, her nipples must be killing her. No one goes for a walk in the snow with that much bare skin on display.  Onto the phantom, Gerard hasn't got the voice for this. I don't care how good looking he is. He screams and yells his way through the more demanding passages and is totally out of key.  One scene springs to mind when he leaps on a gargoyle and yells `that's all I ask of youuuuuuuuuuu!!!' I swear my dog left the room at that point. Its totally cringe worthy, although it could be quite amusing if he was taking the piss, but he's not, he's serious and that's the problem. This guy is so awful it's funny. I actually laughed as he tried to ham it up with all that cape swirling bravado. The sword fight is pretty pathetic as well, which leads me onto Raoul. Bland old Raoul. Do we care about him? I was actually looking forward to him drowning,except for a design flaw in the supposedly genius phantoms water trap. That was tricky wasn't it? Heh, yeah right. But the grand moment of this film, the unveiling of the phantom, was ruined. We hear that stage guy singing about skin like yellow parchment and holes for eyes etc (I'm not quoting, this is from memory) and so I prepared my self for something horrific but instead it was just incredulity.  I believe my original statement was: \\"He starts off with a little mask on, black slicked down hair, normal visible skin and then she whips it off and all of a sudden half this guys face is deformed even his hairline has receded, and speaking of hair, its now a rather sandy colour and sticks out, obviously in an attempted to achieve that `mad scientist' look It ruins the whole moment.\\" I was ripped to shreds for stating that. Apparently the phantom was wearing a wig. A jolly good wig that must have taken hours to apply to get the realistic hail line I'll wager. But the argument goes on: If the phantom was wearing a wig that realistic (which I highly doubt given those times but will consider anyway) it would obviously be stuck on quite well right? Just entertain that fact for a minute, will you. The agility and speed at which she rips of his mask and wig, (although, How did she know it was a wig?) is far too quick. You're telling me it was all off in one fell swoop. Ah! It's the angle, you say? I think not. Freeze framing the DVD proves that. The phantoms face changes like magic in about one second. That's what did it for me. I blame the director. I'm assuming he was going for a dramatic flair. I mean if, after shed ripped his mask off(I'm assuming it wasn't connected to the wig) it would have been quite anticlimactic to have watched her stand on tip toe and attempt to yank his wig off with him yelling `Ow! you're pulling the fake latex skin off my mangled scalp to quickly! It's a special adhesive, you see. liquid soluble only!' You get my point. It was unrealistic. End of story. Blame the director. Anyway the film draws to a close and the phantom, after listening to Christine and Raoul rub in the fact that they are sooo happy, makes his exit through a red drape. Where'd he go? Do I care? Not in the least. I never cared about any of them. We have hardly any background information concerning either character to make them worth our concern. During this short life of mine I've manage to see onstage :Carmen(the Andalucian version), Cats(twice), Fiddler On The Roof, Starlight Express, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, spirit of the dance(we were evacuated half way through, bomb scare) and a couple of pantomimes and amateur theatre company performances, all of which affected me and made me care about the characters. I've never been keen on musicals made into films and I think phantom of the opera was specifically design to be performed on a stage. I didn't enjoy this film at all. I think it was a complete waste of time and effort. I have plans to see the play and perhaps I just might feel like picking up the book in the distant future, Who knows? But as for this film: I think the bad out ways the good, to put it bluntly, it's sh*t.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|I'm a big fan of Chevelle, Disturbed, and Linkin Park. This overall is a great album. Its not one of those albums with only one good song on it. Its got several that are really good. Here are my ratings on the songs... <br /> <br />Highlights: Before I Forget, Duality, and Vermilion <br /> <br />1. Prelude 3/5 - Not a bad song to start out with. <br />2. Blister Exists 1/5 - Not that great. <br />3. Three Nil 1/5 - Not that great either. <br />4. Duality 4/5 - One of my favorites. <br />5. Opium of the People 2/5 - It's OK. <br />6. Circle 3/5 - Not a bad slow song. <br />7. Welcome 1/5 - Not that great. <br />8. Vermilion 4/5 - Great song. Took a couple times to get used to though. <br />9. Pulse of the Maggots 2/5 - Not that great. <br />10. Before I Forget 5/5 - In my opion the best song in the album. Love the chorus and especially the guitar part between the 2nd and 3rd chrorus. <br />11. Vermilion, Pt. 2 3/5 - Slow version of Vermilion with different lyrics but same chorus lyrics. <br />12. Nameless 2/5 - It's ok. <br />13. Virus of Life 1/5 - Not that great. <br />14. Danger - Keep Away 3/5 - Slow and easy going.

B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I was so dissapointed in this album.  When I fist heard \\"Cigaro\\" I thought the album was going to be like their first.  Boy was I wrong.  This is the worst System of a Down album and I can't beleive I wasted my money on buying this.  All the bands that were heavy in the past are so soft right now it makes me want to throw up.  So take my advise, do not buy this album, this album is not worth even getting for free.
B0006GAOCW|2.0|What is life like for the daughter of the U.S. president when it comes time to cut the apron strings and move to another state to attend college? This is the main idea behind \\"First Daughter\\", a film about a girl who has spent most of her life in the spotlight and longs to be treated like an ordinary person.<br /><br />This movie follows a typical movie formula. We have all seen plenty of films involving young adults moving away to go to college and this movie isn't much different. It follows this young girl as she moves far away from her parent's residence at the White House; gets followed around by security personnel; meets a guy and falls for him; and struggles with the media to protect her privacy and reputation.<br /><br />What makes this movie fail in the end is its lack of any real story and the lack of any feeling for the characters. Michael Keaton's portrayal as the U.S. president isn't that good, and you really get annoyed by his indifference toward his daughter. Actress Margaret Colin seems out of place as well. She plays Keaton's wife, and she has very little to say in this movie.<br /><br />If there is anything redeeming about this film, it would have to be Katie Holmes in the lead role. Katie is a pretty woman, but in a cute and innocent way. This makes her character that much more compelling. She seems so helpless and so sweet, you can't help but root for her to triumph over the media and its annoying and unethical treatment of her. And you hope she can work things out with her parents and live the life she wants to live without interference.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a very good movie. It isn't terrible, but it is mostly predictable and the performances (with the exception of Katie Holmes) are not very memorable. It's the type of film that will be enjoyed most by people who can relate to it; i.e, teenagers and college students who can empathize with the young woman's problems and concerns.
B00004TL21|4.0|I'm a big fan of Chevelle, Slipknot, and Linkin Park. Yes Linkin Park, and from the reviews I've read about Deftones' albums it doesn't seem like many of their fans like Linkin Park. But oh well, I like Linkin Park and Deftones. This is my first Deftones album and overall I have to say its pretty good. It has some good songs and some alright songs but you have to listen to most of them several times to get to really like them. Anyway, here are my ratings on the songs: <br /> <br />1. Feiticeira 2/5 - Not a great song to start the album off with but its an alright song. <br />2. Digital Bath 3/5 - I like this song. Its got a nice beat to it. <br />3. Elite 1/5 - Too much screaming. Not a very good song at all. <br />4. Rx Queen 4/5 -Love the song. Great beat. Well done. <br />5. Street Carp 2/5 - Lame lyrics. <br />6. Teenager 2/5 - An ok slow beated song. Kinda boring. <br />7. Knife Prty 4/5 - Don't like the lyrics. Love how he mixes the guitar with his voice.  <br />8. Korea 3/5 - In my opinion the heaviest song on the album. <br />9. Passenger 5/5 - My favorite song on the album. Love the lyrics. Love the beat. Just wish the 1st chorus could have been repeated a few more times. The 2nd one just isn't as great. <br />10. Change(In the House of Flies) 4/5 - Good song. <br />11. Pink Maggit 1/5 - Worst song on the album.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Sorry, I comprehended everything this movie was trying to get across, it still isn't deep, and thought provoking as some misguided poster will have you believe. Some people have the notion that if you don't like a movie then you don't understand it or it was over your head in some way. It must be hard for them to understand that bad cinema is just bad cinema and most people just genuinely hate this film. They like to think that they are part of some elite group of \\"intellectuals\\". However, sadly they are not, judging by the spelling and grammatical errors that I have frequently come across while viewing some of these posts.    Nevertheless, getting along with the movie it just wasn't well executed. Bad acting, special effects, directing, plot, miscast roles and the list goes on. Not to mention the fact that it is theologically incorrect in its ideologies. I wasn't expecting this movie to be The Passion of the Christ, but let's try for some accuracy here. I suspect that the humanist/atheist/secularist crowds will enjoy this \\"film\\" if that is what you want to call it. But as for me it was a brain numbing experience.
0061015725|4.0|Crichton certainly lives up to the thriller label with this book. I listened to an audio version, and I was completely hooked from start to finish. Jack Foreman, our protagonist, is an unemployed (for reasons not his fault) computer programmer who gets called in to help solve the problem of a biotechnology company producing something in the desert. The something turns out to be a human-made technology that learns, reproduces, and is exceedingly dangerous! Lots of twists, turns, and red herrings make this a wonderful ride.     Occasionally, I got a little bogged down with the scientific explanations, but those are both the blessing and the curse of Crichton work (Airframe is another great thriller of his where I had similar feelings). I'm also never quite sure with Crichton how much of the science is real science and how much is...fiction. And Crichton's introduction about the dangers of messing with nature felt pretty heavy-handed. I have no doubt he's right, but it still felt a little paternalistic: if we don't do something soon, then something like what happened in my novel won't be so fictional after all. (I'm overstating, but this is the feel.) Overall, this was a great ride.
1565115147|5.0|Sometimes back I read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\\" by Jared Diamond. No doubt a fantastic book which deserves five stars ... It talks about how the environmental factors contributed towards the evolution of humans. <br /> <br />Some of the questions he tries to answer ... <br /> <br />1. Why some Hunter-gatherers in some places moved on to farming and others did not?. <br /> <br />(The author suggests that when cost-benefit analysis is done, in some cases hunting-gathering was better(for example ... it takes time to plant and grow the plants) and other cases it was not.  The author emphasizes that the benefits of planned farming were enormous ... it enabled humans to grow more food in per square unit of an area. This in turn enabled population growth.) <br /> <br />2. Why only some plants/vegetables were domesticated? <br /> <br />3. Why the Eurasians were more successful in plant domestication (b'cos of their latitudinal layout) whereas not that successful in African/American continent (due to to longitudinal layout)? <br /> <br />4. How plant domestication lead to Trade? <br /> <br />5. How reading/writing/languages got propagated all around the world? <br /> <br />The book has wealth and wealth of information backed up with real evidence pointing towards facts. Highly, highly enlightening book ... <br /> <br />-Sachin
B0001OGW1G|5.0|I didn't know what to expect of Chucklewood since we never heard of them before.  But, I can say that the stories are nice for kids and do seem to hold their attention.<br /><br />We now own all four volumes and each has been enjoyed.<br /><br />The price is right, too!
B0006M4SO6|4.0|I've heard this album so many times I can't even begin to count.  I feel bad giving this album 4 stars because I hold Pat to standards miles above everyone else.  So this review is based on Pat's standards; keep in mind that it's still a piece of music far beyond the capability of anyone else alive. <br /> <br />This album is basically a bunch of different sections that weave in and out, sometimes overlapping.  It works quite well actually--but the middle section is just simply too long and missing that emotional level that usually exists in Pat's music.  The intro and closing are fun to listen to because they are busy with strumming, odd beats, full chords and buildup.  The first six minutes of Part One introduces the simplest yet most prevalent theme on the album that's played over and over in many different contexts, and almost sounds progressive-rocky.  Yet after this section dies out, I feel as if I'm walking across a very long desert.  There's a couple of rocks here and there, but mostly it's just a flat walk.  I want the moutains that Metheny creates--I don't want to get bored. <br /> <br />The straight-ahead jazz sections kind of pop out of nowhere, and I almost feel like he put those in there as a response to people calling his music cheesy (which it sometimes is, but we learn to get past that).  The Way Up definitely has its share of beautiful sections--the pinnacle I'd say being in Part Three (the closing) starting around 7:45 or so when all of the themes sort of come together and build up to a climax. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Metheny is a master of composition and his instrument.  I don't think he went in over his head with his album.  I think he was trying to not keep the middle section \\"too busy,\\" but in doing so he kind of left an opening that needs to be filled somehow. <br /> <br />Just a quick recap on the musicians: Antonio Sanchez (drummer) is out of this world on this album.  Cuong Vu (trumpet) makes some really well-fit-in backgroundnoises and adds color to this album that no other trumpet player can do--his range isn't amazing, but that's not what he's here for.  Lyle Mays takes more of a background approach in this as well--he has a few solos, but nothing extraordinary.  Gregoire Maret (harmonica) has his moment of glory, and it sounds nice and Western (because that's how harmonicas sound to me), but I get a little bored when listening.  Steve Rodby holds his fort down, and has a little solo where the bass plays the melody (I love this part) in what I call the \\"whale section\\"--it kind of reminds me of whale song.  And Pat is at his best with soloing here, although I feel like more recently he plays the same licks more and more often.  With the exception of his solo in Part One at around 20:00, where he plays one of the best and most melodic, unique, and well developed solos I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Overall, a definite must, but didn't quite live up to its year-long hype.  But that would have been nearly impossible.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the beginning of a series of six films uniting the original cast.  It was definitely a noble venture with the legendary Robert Wise at the helm.  The film brought a certain intellectual treatment to the film which may have made it less appealing to the masses but certainly palatable for true Trek fans.  The \\"cerebral\\" quality of the film and the ending made for a rather unique experience!  I know generally it is considered the \\"slowest\\" of the six but special in that it brought back the original castmembers all of which looked great in the film!  Odd enough..Nimoy's voice sounded deeper in this film than the others that followed as if he were trying to find his \\"legs\\" after being away from the character for so long...George Takei looked fit and healthy and so did Shatner!  Actually Shatner looked thinner in this film than when he was in the last season of TOS.  Persis Khambatta was so lovely in this film!  I was saddened to hear that she died in the late 90's of a massive heart attack..She was so beautiful in this film and leaves a lasting legacy for future Trek devotees!  I love watching this film for the dialogue and wonderful Jerry Goldsmith score!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have to admit that I am by far a Star Wars fanatic...but I do enjoy these films!!! I have seen all of the older films, and with that, I expected no less of a performance from this lot of newer films, explaining of a time before the original Star Wars.  I decided to give these a try, to see if my son would like them...and he really did...lots of action, and it gave him a good overview of the story!!  Very interesting...now going to watch Episode II!!!!
B000063DI9|5.0|I consider this to be a *Top 3* Iron Maiden album.  You can read my other reviews to see what I consider the other two to be.  This is also the last Iron Maiden studio album to feature Adrian Smith...that is up until the BRAVE NEW WORLD album, when he joined the band again.  This was also a peak for Iron Maiden, for it was the year they headlined the Monsters of Rock festival.  The only place they could go after this, unfortunately, was down.   <br /> <br />I believe the band reached a point on this disc that was envisioned on the previous album but had not yet been reached.  We still have the element of keyboards, but the songs are heavier and better written.  I've also heard some people say this was a concept album.  If it is, its a very weak one - if you want to hear concept albums that have a more concrete story line, then I direct you to Queensryche's OPERATION MINDCRIME or Dream Theater's SCENES FROM A MEMORY.   <br /> <br />My favorite song here is 'The Evil That Men Do' - it has that 'epic' nature that Iron Maiden brings out in the music.  The main musical theme of the song is classic, and we also get a great solo from Adrian Smith.   <br /> <br />I also love the two progressive songs here - 'Infinite Dreams' and the title track.  'Infinite Dreams' covers questions about life, death, and religion.  It also changes several times, musically speaking.  The harmonies fit the chord changes tightly and subtle nuances such as the guitar bends during the intro all play a major part.  You can tell they spent a long time writing some of these songs, and it shows - it is a true labor of love.  The title track is also well written and is probably the toughest Maiden song to play on the guitar.  It also has a spoken word section reminiscent of the spoken word part on 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner.' <br /> <br />We also get a big hit in 'Clairvoyant' - although it is musically inferior in comparison to some of the other songs on this release.  Another favorite of mine wasalways 'Only the Good Die Young' - it has some fantastic lyrics like \\"If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today/Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays.\\" <br /> <br />If you enjoy this album, I recommend you pick up the live concert video (from Monsters of Rock) called MAIDEN ENGLAND - it has most of the songs from SEVENTH SON and some from SOMEWHERE IN TIME on it plus some great classics like 'Still Life,' 'Die With Your Boots,' and 'Killers'! <br />
B0002S94BG|5.0|I'd been looking for a while for some music with the emotional and music depth of Pat Metheny.  I didn't find anything until I came across Jeff Buckley.    Nearly every single song on this album has been my \\"favorite song\\" at some point during the past month.  Every song is unique in its own way, with its own flavor and melody.  Jeff Buckley's vocals are completely out of this world; even when wailing in the upper stratosphere he has complete control over his voice, running his bone-chilling vibrato all the way up through his 4-octave range.  We have \\"Grace\\"--an almost progressive poppy piece with key changes and a driving beat.  \\"Last Goodbye\\" is a tear-jerking song about leaving a lover--one of my favorites.  His version of \\"Hallelujah\\" is so simplistic yet beautiful, with just soft guitar and vocals.  \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" has almost a gospel-like tone to it.    I could go on, but my point is clear: this album is a must.  The expanded version is necessary simply because of the single best song I've ever heard: Forget Her.  Buckley apparently took this out of the original 'Grace' and replaced it with 'So Real' (another classic) probably because he needed something that sounded a little different, but the vocals, chord progressions, and feel to the song gives me chills every time I listen.
B0007P3582|1.0|BOO FIFTY SUCKS YEAH THATS RIGHT CAUSE HE IS A COTTON HEADED NINNY MUGGINS AND HE IS STUPID REAL RAP IS DIZZEE RASCAL AND RUN DMC AND THE SHINS BUT THEY ARE NOT RAP BUT THE BEST BAND EVER AND THIS GUY IS STUPID DID ANYONE READ HIS SPIN INTERVIEW HE IS REALLY REALLY STUPID BECAUSE HE IS A STUPID PERSON WHO IS STUPID!!!!!!!!!!
B000068G9X|5.0|Expertly produced & mixed (especially compared to the latest danzig albums), every song rocks, nice and EVIL sounding.  If you've never heard Danzig solo before this is a good album to start with.
B000063DHL|4.0|As of 1986, this was Iron Maiden's weakest album.  It is still a 'must own' for Maiden fans, but does not meet the high standards that were set by albums like POWERSLAVE and SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON.  This was also the first Maiden album to use keyboards, and while they act as a refreshing element, they are not fully developed yet.  This also marks the spot in the band's history when they started writing corny songs.  The musicianship, especially the guitar harmonies and solos are excellent, but the guys were either drinking too much or nervously searching for writing ideas. <br /> <br />The two popular songs here are 'Heaven Can Wait' and 'Wasted Years.'  'Wasted Years' is a *Top 10* Iron Maiden song with one of the best-built Adrian Smith guitar solos I can recall.  The music video was also a 'Maiden Montage' of sorts with video clips of the band and shots of all the album and single covers.  'Heaven Can Wait' became a famous concert song because of the sing-along section where the band would usually bring part of the crowd on stage.  It's also progressive in the way that it is structured - there are some themes within the song that are not repeated. <br /> <br />Another fan favorite is the hardest rocking song on the album - 'Stranger in a Strange Land.'  They released it as a single and made a music video for it as well.  The single cover had Eddie dressed like a drifter in a bar that was reminiscent of something out of Star Wars with other 'creatures' present.  You can also find a live copy of it on the 'Maiden England' video/dvd.   <br /> <br />The other songs are somewhat progressive and feature some great musicianship, especially on 'Sea of Madness' and the title track, however to go back to what I said earlier - you can't get away with songs like 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' and 'Alexander the Great' without raising a few eyebrows.  Is this a history lesson or a heavy metal album?  'Alexander the Great' reminds me of 'Stonehenge' from THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  Earlier songs like 'Killers' and 'Prowler' were simpler in lyrical content but didn't make the band look like a bunch of sissies.  I don't enjoy being that harsh about this album, but no one ever seems to bring up the cornyness of some of these tunes!   <br /> <br />To those who are considering purchasing this disc, I recommend you buy SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON first.  On that album, I believe the band reaches a point they were still aiming for on SOMEWHERE IN TIME.
B0007VZ91C|3.0|If you like your chant on the sweet and syrupy side, you'll probably like this recording.  Easy listening, yes, and there is no denying Premal has a lovely voice but I'm looking for chant with the power to transport me into a truly sacred space. A cd that does manage to convey a beautifully authentic and pure essence is \\"Travelling the Sacred Sound Current\\" by sound healer Deborah Van Dyke.  Dakshina will no doubt appeal to those contented by new age soft-listening, but its a bit too produced and commercial for my taste.
B000069HK2|5.0|My new fvorite band is here just a few weeks ago (December 2001)I heard a box full of sharp objects on 104.9 and was BLOWN AWAY.

B000002KKS|4.0|After Ozzy left Black Sabbath in 1978 it was thought that Sabbath would crumble without him. Although this album dosent top Ozzys 1980 solo classic \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" it is still a good album and it shows that Sabbath can do just fine without Ozzy. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Neon Knights (4/5)- Gets  kinda off track as the song progresses but still good.  2.Children Of The Sea (5/5)- Great main riff, best song on the album  3.Lady Evil (4/5)  4.Heaven And Hell (4.5/5)- somewhat overrated but still a great song  5.Wishing Well (3/5)- an okay song but I always skip it, in fact I hardly ever keep listening to the album past Heaven And Hell  6.Die Young (3/5)- A Mediocre pop-ish rock song  7.Walk Away (3/5)- Nothing Special, its so generic  8.Lonely Is The Word (2/5))- A filler song made too show off Dio's vocal range    If you like Rock or Hard rock music check this album out. If you like softer metal you might also like it.    If you liked this album you might also like:  Dio-Holy Diver  Iron Maiden-The Number Of The Beast  Judas Priest-British Steel  Samson-Head On
B00005AQGH|3.0|2pac with the don killuminati, delivers a few of his best songs: Hail Mary, Live n Die in LA, Toss it Up, (all 3 are on his greatest hits album) but this album can NOT compete wit some of earlier work. If you really want to experience the BEST pac has to offer, cop yourself \\"All Eyez On Me\\" - one of the best rap albums ever made, \\"Me Against the World\\" - Pac's first classic or \\"Strictly for my N.I.G.G.A.\\" - a very strong album 1st before you get this one. The don killuminati is held back by the constant rage of 2pac, its basically song after song after song of attackin' all the big names  of east coast rap. <br />His posse, the Outlawz, who i personally like a lot, does NOTHING to help the album, in fact they make it a bit worse. If Pac was still alive to make more songs, revise and work on this album, it could have been another masterpiece, but its not, its only above average. <br /> <br />So, bottomline: \\"the don killuminati\\" above average/good album, but get the 3 i mentioned first, if you really wanna know what Pac is all about. <br />Interesting sidenote, if you turn the volume up REALLY loud, on the 1st song of the intro of this cd, before the 1st bell rings (in the song), you can hear Pac say: \\"Suge shot me\\" as in Suge Knight, the deathrow record producer, the same man who was driving the car when pac was killed....................
0786261641|3.0|Written by a young Irish solicalite, this debut novel is funny and sad, well-written, and timely (for me).  As you know, I love first novels, as most are based on the writer's life experinces.  This one is the exception, as the author is so very young.  And yet I learned some things from her to get me through my period of grief.    About Holly, she writes, \\"She was a woman who made mistakes.  She was a woman who sometimes just got things wrong.  Whatever lay ahead, she would obey Gerry's final message and seek another true love.\\"    I've never lost a loving husband, but an older lady shared with me the time her husband tragically drown while saving a young boy, leaving her with two young daughters to raise alone -- this happened forty years ago and she still can feel the pain. I did lose my 'first love' developed at the age of seventeen.  He did not die, at least, I don't think he has.  But, like Gerry, he will forever be in my heart and 'good memories of growing up.'  It is the first love which makes the most impact on a young girl's life.    However, when you are older, and worried about your own mortality and just not ready to 'give up' yet, a death in the family (as in James Agee's book, ALL THE WAY HOME) with the wrong (younger) person dying, it is harder to \\"grieve\\" -- you just get mad and lash out at innocent people.  I think I had the whole town upset with me a couple of months ago, from the Mayor on down to menials, when I learned that my twenty-yr.old grandson Tristan had been killed in a car accident.    I was told yesterday by a person who I had disliked a few years ago (because of his rudeness) that the first stage of grief is anger.  And, boy, have I been angry with the world at large!  Why a young man who had his life before him -- why not me!  But a rude Hispanic male on the bus yesterday as I was on the way to see the latest STAR WARS movie, woke me up.  His rudeness did not make me angry, it made me sad for someone so young and uneducated to treatan 'old lady' that way.    In this lovely book, her husband left behind some advice in the form of notes for her to get on with her life.  He knew he would die of a brain tumor.  Most of us don't know when or how we will die.  But Holly carried on and, though, she missed her adored one, she was able to do mundane and exciting things with friends.  And, glory be, she ran into a stranger at a local store and invites him to a bar for a cup of coffee.  She, my dear, is a modern woman.  We need more Hollys in this world, as opposed to the Holly-Go-Lightlys.      Ms. Ahern has out two more novels.  More power to her.  She's from a fantastic family, but is the most fantastic of all!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Nobody comes close. Even those \\"super vocalists\\" such as Whitney Houston, don't write and produce their own music, which Madonna does.
B00000612Q|5.0|NEVER A DULL MOMENT, like the three albums that preceeded it, shows Rod Stewart's roots in the Memphis-Chicago-Muscle Shoals-Great Plains-Texas-Detroit blues/R&B/soul/rock & roll axis, American and British Isles folk, and country and western, with lyrics that cut just as deep as those on EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY. \\"You Wear It Well\\" could be about any relationship (love, friendship, work, etc.) ruined through one's own devices, while \\"True Blue\\" expresses joy at having succeeded at anything but also a secret pining for \\"the good old days\\"; thus for me, the song explains why, at various times, I've rejected the latest musical trends in favor of classic rock and oldies. Rod sometimes got as good as this later, but he never got better after this album.
B0002234LS|5.0|I'm so surprised that there are negative reviews for this movie - this was one of the most enjoyable suspense movies I've ever seen. No, it's not a masterpiece, but it is excellent none-the-less.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is fantastic at his portrayal of a depressed writer who lives out in the middle of the woods in an isolated cabin in a very isolated town. The man who appears on his doorstep looks like an ordinary man, but is extremely menacing in his straight-faced threats. That unwelcome visit is from a man claiming that Johnny Depp's character \\"stole my story.\\" Those few chilling words set off a course of events that will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. Finally the end has such a marvelous twist.<br /><br />This movie is very reminiscent of Hitchcock, very well acted, and well paced. It is definitely worth watching - we liked it so much we bought the DVD.
0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley is a jewel among feminist authors.  She  writes with restraint and tenderness, and love for her subject, and her characters.  The cool regard of her scrutiny touches male and female characters alike, as does her compassion.<br /><br />This book does many things on many levels, and I'll list a few of them, in case they happen to be important to potential readers.<br /><br />(1) It is a plausible, and generally complete telling of the Athurian story, even if it is a different point of view from the traditional one.  It's all there, with the additional advantage of motivations understandable to modern readers.<br /><br />(2) It is a distillation of the supplanting of the matriarchal culture of ancient Britain with the patriarchal culture of the early Church.  She perhaps does not present the philosophical and anthropological (religious and social) issues as well or as persuasively as do certain other feminist writers (e.g. Karin Kallmaker), but they are there.<br /><br />(3) It is a somewhat restrained indictment of the rigidity of the clergy of the Middle Ages, and indeed of Christian clergy generally.  Indeed she is more gentle with some of these men than I could ever bring myself to be.  This is not a book for Christian True Believers; they will feel persecuted at every turn.  Merlin the Druid is a more eloquent advocate for the new religion than its own bishop Patricius (later St Patrick), whose purging of Ireland of serpents is represented as ridding it of druids.  On the other hand, even if the author does not rub the reader's face in the more chilling aspects of druidic rites, they are represented honestly.<br /><br />(4) It provides, as I say, plausible motives for what the principals in the legend did.  The traditional legends would have us believe that women of those days were mindless, lust-driven and evil, or saintly and weak.  The men, likewise, were cunning,  manipulative and crafty, or brave but innocent.  But the author gives us a look into the missing years of upbringing and education that fills in the logic behind the sketchy stories of the legends.  Until 'Avalon', I could never understand why these people might have done the things they did.<br /><br />(5) The story creates a remarkably believable character in the agoraphobic, short-sighted, tender-hearted Guinevere (Gwynhyfar).  The famous exposure of the adultery of Guinevere and Launcelot (Lancelet) is set when they are in their fifties, after the court has turned a blind eye to the long-standing affair for decades.  The author also portrays the troubled relationship between Guinevere and Morgan, whom she hated, envied and feared, as also often loving and caring.  What a genius is Marion Zimmer Bradley!  No one can represent ambiguous feelings better than she could!<br /><br />(6) It provides a satisfying explanation of the mystery of the Holy Grail, and other legends connecting ancient Britain with the Holy Land, and Joseph of Arimathea, long before the crusades.  It does not dispel the mystery, but acquaints the reader with collected stories about the Chalice that are interesting in their own right.<br /><br />This first large-scale literary work by this author has a few shortcomings: she works hard at explaining the philosophical problems that the characters struggle with, and with which we struggle today. In subsequent works (e.g. Firebrand) she succeeds better in laying the underlying tensions between the lines.  But even if parts of the book appear to be rewritten to the point of self-consciousness, it largely succeeds in keeping enough momentum and continuity of tone that enables the reader to gallop along with the story.<br /><br />No matter how I study the genius of Marion Zimmer Bradley, I can't believe how I feel about Queen Guinevere.  Much as I expect to feel nothing but anger and disgust towards the weak, closed- minded, jealous woman, the author leaves me feeling only admiration and compassion.  Her portrayal of Arthur is equally brilliant; instead of seeming weak and pathetic, he comes across as consistent, patient and responsible.  But most magical of all is her portrayal of the passionate Morgaine, Arthur's half-sister.  From the moment the tiny eight-year-old is commanded to look after her infant brother (which she does), to the moment when he dies in her arms, one never stops believing in the tender love between them.  Somehow Marion Zimmer Bradley is able to depict it as beautiful, rather than the tainted, ugly, lustful thing shown in other accounts.<br /><br />This is a mythic book, in that all the characters are true individuals, but also achetypes of people we all know and love.  If she had succeeded too well, they would all be cliches.  But if she had failed in that, we could not respect this book as a worthy retelling of the legend.  But it is just right, as Goldilocks might have said, and here it is!<br /><br />A must-read.<br /><br />Arch, 5/20/2005trayal of Arthur is equally brilliant; instead of seeming weak and pathetic, he comes across as consistent, patient and responsible.

B0001BPREM|5.0|Set in the mid 1950s - Julia Roberts plays Katherine Ann Watson , a fresh out of college graduate who manages to get a job at a very prestigious private girls college , as an art history teacher. There she sets out to teach the girls to see life in a whole new way , while coming up against the school establishment.<br />Alongside Roberts stars Kirsten Dunst as Betty Warren the insecure , 'bitchy' debutante , who rejects Miss Watsons ideas (until the end where she shows a whole new side to her character) , Maggie Gyllenhall as the 'free spirited' Giselle Levy-the token Jewish girl in an all wasp college , Julia Styles as the pretty and high achieving Joan Brandwyn , and Ginnifer Goodwyn as the good natured Connie Baker.<br />All the girls are through their trials and tribulations looking for love and a place in the circle of life.<br />It is as much about the girls as it is about the teacher , as their lives are shaped in a new way. Unlike most feminist movies , it has a balanced message , recognizing that a girl must follow her heart , and if she wants to raise a family as her mission , that is also OK!<br />The storyline itself was not what made this movie unforgettable , it was the characters , and the excellent acting that ensured there was never a dull moment
B000000WHC|2.0|I just popped this CD in and popped it out about as quickly.  I gave track one about 12 seconds and track 2 about 4 seconds before I heard all I needed to hear.  I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad CD, but calling it \\"blues\\" is a bit of a stretch.  He may be playing some blues standards but the sound is very much hard guitar rock.
0618164413|5.0|My 3 year old daughter has recently discovered Curious George so while looking for a few books to buy her, I came across this one and thought that for the price, it was a great value. I was right. She loves the stories and we read them over and over. We have had no trouble with the binding or any other aspects of the book construction. It's been fun for my husband and I to read the background information about the Reys and how George came to be and how he's evolved. We were both George fans when we were kids so it's great fun to be able to share him with our daughter. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I won't try to recap all the positive things that have already been said by other reviewers for this album, but I will say this: don't try to judge the album on only one or two listens. Unless you're some kind of genius, you can't do it (as some so-called \\"professional\\" reviewers have apparently tried). The music is too layered and varied rhythmically and lyrically to be able to pick up everything all at once. I had to listen to it at least about 6 times before I could begin to anticipate all of the music's subtleties, and there really is joy in the anticipation (\\"Sunspots\\" being my current favorite example). Even the album's most accessible track, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", takes a few tries to really get into (no wonder that as of this writing, it is again the number-one single on the Billboard charts). But because of all that inherent complexity, the music has a low burn-out rate; most mainstream music is only listenable for a couple-dozen times at most before the listener gets bored with it. \\"With Teeth\\", on the other hand, has staying-power (I've listened to the album at least about 40 times so far, if not more...I've since lost count, and I'm not bored of it by any means).<br /><br />Just give the music an honest chance, and you won't be disappointed. Yes, Trent's back, as good as (though, arguably, *better* than) ever.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I have followed system since '98 and have never been disappointed. This album would be my favorite in every way. Throughout the disc I hear lots of the traditional metal that have been around for years like slayer, iron maiden, old punk riffs with all the quick changes and obnoxiousness that system is known for. If you like old school metal and like systems style this album is it, I think they have done metal a favor here. If I had to choose the best songs they would be Questions!, sad statue, radio/video, old school hollywood, and the rest.... <br /> <br />4 out of 5 Not long enough!
B000002OX5|3.0|I love this album, it's one of the best albums of the 1960's. BUT, this remaster has many noticable differences from the original album! The biggest offender is that Pete's lead vocal on \\"I Can't Reach You\\" is single-tracked here rather than double-tracked like on the original. Also, the vocals on the intro of \\"Rael\\" are mixed up too high, drowning out the music. <br /> <br />So, if you've known and loved this album for years, you may want to hang on to the original CD. The sound quality isn't as good, but at least you'll hear the album the way it was heard in '68. Even better, seek out a Mono copy of the original album on Decca. It contains the DEFINITIVE mix of \\"I Can See For Miles\\".
B00005JNBQ|3.0|But only because the character, Napoleon, is one we can all remember from our high school days.  I was definitely not in the popular crowd in high school, I just kind of existed.  But I remember kids taking beatings and abuse all the time for just being themselves.  Napoleon is just such a character.  His hair looks like he hasn't brushed it in years, he openly breathes through his mouth annoyingly, he stores the cafeteria's tater tots in a fanny pack to eat later in class, he has terrible glasses and answers every question seemingly with a mini tantrum, as if it was the stupidest question he had ever heard.  This attitude, along with his appearance, make him a complete loser in school. <br /> <br />There isn't much of a storyline, just Napoleon's interactions during the film with some weird characters.  His brother is a chat room addict, his uncle can't stop thinking of 1982, when he was a high school jock and just missed on his big chance, he has a new friend at the school, a mexican student named Pedro, who is just as quiet and withdrawn as he is.  Eventually Pedro will decide to run for class president and Napoleon will help him.  This brings about the only semblance of a climax to the film, but otherwise, it is just Napoleon and \\"the lovely state of Idaho\\" on display here. <br /> <br />This is not a bad film.  It is not great, at least not to me.  I teach in a high school now and saw the movie basically because my class talked about it all the time.  I can't say that I know any Napoleons at the high school I teach at, but he's probably there, calling everybody an idiot and going outside to feed his grandmother's llama.  I just haven't noticed him yet.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I never expected Singing' in the Rain to be such a wonderful movie. For years, I was only familiar with the theme song, and out of context as one usually encounters it, I didn't really think much of it. A while ago, however, I saw a part of it on television and I liked it so much that I decided to buy the DVD. <br /> <br />It is a sweet love story, as well as a film about the making of film at the crucial stage in Hollywood history when the silent movie was replaced by the talkie. Debbie Reynolds, playing the newly discovered talent Kathy Selden, is sweet, adorable, a singer with a lovely voice, and a good dancer. Jean Hagen, playing the celebrated Hollywood star Lina Lamont, is somewhat of a villain in the movie, yet extremely likable. Between them is Gene Kelly, who sings and dances superbly, which goes without saying.  <br /> <br />This is not only a women's movie, and it's not only about some musical numbers. It is very witty, full of subtle humour, as well as dramatizes a fascinating aspect of film history. It is also highly entertaining, and one of those movies that improve on repeated viewings.  <br /> <br />I wasn't crazy about all of the musical numbers, but most of them are fantastic: \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" is simply beautiful and the setting in which it is performed perfectly matches the song; \\"Would You\\" is very good, and the way in which it is used in context is very witty; \\"Good Morning\\" is cheerful and sung to a dance in which Debbie Reynolds wears a sweet blue dress and sweet blue shoes to match; \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" is charming; there are many others, most of them quite good, but these are the best.  <br /> <br />The second disc is replete with informative extras, such as a documentary about the making of musicals at MGM studios, which includes extracts from famous and not so famous movies; a new documentary about Singin' in the Rain, hosted by Debbie Reynolds, which I found very good; extracts from movies in which the songs used in this filmoriginated, which are also extremely interesting; and song outtakes. There is also audio commentary and additional features which you can enable while watching the movie, but I'll let you discover that one by yourself.  <br /> <br />I have an ever-growing collection of DVDs, and I consider this one to be one of my best buys. Decidedly a movie that I do not tire of rewatching. <br /> <br />
B00005AUBA|4.0|To all those expecting literal \\"rock action\\": the title is meant to be tongue-in-cheek.<br />It took me a couple of listens to really get into this - I listened to it two times in a row right after I bought it. The album is a little short, my main gripe. But its subtlety and grace add width and depth to make up for it.<br />My first listen was disappointing; I kept waiting for something truly exciting to happen. But about halfway through I started to embrace the album's distant and mellow feel. By the end, I was really enjoying the swelling beauty and intricacy of the sound. My second listen was more rewarding, as I was prepared/trained for what was to come, while still eager for surprises. There are many layers to this enigmatic offering, and I imagine yet more listenings will help peel them away. The vocals are understated and the lyrics nearly inaudible, but they both fit nicely into the groove of the recording. The drumming was a real treat, as it seemed to rise and fall in perfect rhythm with the other instruments. The overall mood of this album is bittersweet, honest and hopeful - predictably sad, but deceptively simple.<br />On second thought, Rock Action is nebulous and unrewarding. I sold it. By the way, there IS such a thing as taking \\"understated\\" too far.
B000002UAU|5.0|While I agree sgt pepper is maybe not the best album ever it is probably the best album made in the 60s,with it's only competition coming from other beatles albums and maybe floyds piper at the gates of dawn. I think people that call it overrated are just jealous of it's status and that it overshadows their favorite bands work(ie fans of beach boys,stones etc,interesting bands but even hardcore fans of these bands deep down know they are not in the same league as the beatles) <br />My advice disregard the angry misguided people who rant against this masterpiece as well as those who give it a back handed compliment and listen to it yourself. <br />It is the best the 60s has to offer and highly recommended to all who love music. <br />Cheers <br />  <br />
0930289455|4.0|Some of the previous reviews had talked about this being a Batman story, and as such, a weak Batman story. They would be right if this were a Batman story. But it's not. It's a Joker story. The bulk of the story occurs in flashback as we learn how the Joker became the Joker. Even though this is a story that has been retold many times, Moore gives a definitive version, yet still allows for later revisions. <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes I remeber it one way, sometimes another...\\" says the Joker show that this origin story may not be what 'really happened' after all.  <br /> <br />The art is expemlary. Bolland's illustrations seem to come alive. He does better than the painted \\"realism\\" of Kingdom Come or Marvels. Super heroes work better in line drawings and Bolland does this better than most I've seen. <br /> <br />Of course, Moore himself had said this is not his best work. Upon reflection, it may not be, if fact. Possibly Bolland's stand-out art help smooths over the places where the narrative sags and the narrative flows better where Bolland's compositions leave something to be desired. A pity that his worst story is better than most of the stuff out there.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|\\"Team America-World Police\\" is an adult-based puppet movie with tons of adult-rated humor. \\"Team America-World Police\\" is a squadron of vigelantes saving the world by nearly blowing it up at the same time. The comedy is crude, but funny. The scenes are lewd, but hysterical.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Ok voice, ok songs. I was non too impressed.  <br />I prefer much deeper lyrics, better songs and a much stronger vocal range, a la an Annie Lennox and Sarah M., Ms. True Colors herself and the Queen of Soul.  <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok.  People say that this album sucks and i'm always like.. dude.. you're so dumb.  Yeh its not as heavy as Iowa or Slipknot, but I mean, the album is a masterpiece.  The songs are great.  Duality is probably the best.  I think anyone could relate to that.  Vermillion is priceless.  Even though a lot would disagree, the sound and slowness of Vermillion Pt. 2 fits the lyrics a lot better then Pt. 1.  I'm kinda so so on songs like..Welcome, The Blister Exists, Three Nil, and The Virus Of Life.  The rest are just unbelievable.  From Iowa to Vol. 3... is like crawling to walking.  Its for the better.  I know you will enjoy this album if you like \\"mainstream\\" metal and metal with harmony and rythmn.
B0000JCFPE|3.0|The primary purpose of this movie seems to be to show off Sharon Stone's body and the give her and assorted other characters the opportunity to #$% like minks. They throw in a psycho murder mystery for free. <br /> <br />The story involves a police investigation where a murder is just like one described in a book. The investigating officer pursues the author of the book and at various time is convinced of her guilt and of her innocence. Along the way, he manages to be a suspect himself and to suspect an old flame who also happens to be an old flame of the author. It is all very sordid and convoluted. That does not stop it from being an intriguing mystery. <br /> <br />In addition to gratutious sex and nudity this film also offers quite a few unexpected plot twists and surprises. One of the most surprising things for me was number of times when I became convinced of the author's guilt only to be proven wrong...for a while. In the meantime, the body count continues to rise. <br /> <br />This is certainly not a bad psycho drama but I certainly would not put it up there with the best. It does provide a lot of...scenery.
B0008KLVG4|1.0|I have invested, over and over again (I guess I should have learned by now) in DVDs that were eventually rereleased in so-called \\"Special Editions\\"--the list is long.<br /><br />Now, I haven't seen this version (at the time I'm writing this, it hasn't been released), but I did buy the LAST \\"Special Edition\\" of 'Jaws'. Little did I know that it wasn't the REAL \\"Special Edition\\".<br /><br />I guess the studios think we're all stupid. Perhaps we are. After all, we end up shelling out the extra cash to buy the latest edition. Here's an idea: let's stop buying initially released films on DVD. Let's wait a year or two for a \\"Special Edition\\".<br /><br />The most recent egregious example was \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\". It was released in a single disc edition, only to be released again a few MONTHS later in a two-disc edition. Of course, I'd already bought the first disc. Scandalous!<br /><br />Please stop, studios. We all know you're losing money, but that's because of the overall poor quality of your product. Stop sticking it to those of us that are the biggest movie fans--those of us that are creating a DVD library. It really needs to stop.<br /><br />\\"Jaws\\" gets 4.5 stars. Studio money-grubbing gets zero stars.<br /><br />Edited to respond to those who say \\"get over it\\". Sorry, not made of money. I would love to have every single version available. Calling me cheap is wrong and silly. Why not debate the facts rather than resort to name calling?
B000001ELL|5.0|I think DYNASTY is the best KISS album ever, by far! No other KISS album even comes anywhere near it! Every track on it is superb! KISS is the best hard rock group, ever. I could listen to DYNASTY every day! It is musically breathtaking!
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is in my opinion the first really great Beatles album. One I can listen to  from start to finish. The one thing that really blows me away is that  they went from the teen \\"mop top\\" sound  of \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" to the swirling, mind-bending \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\" in just three years. Simply astounding.
B00005A0N5|5.0|I admit I'm a recent convert to the so-called \\"Goth Metal\\" sound, but Nightwish are the very best. This album was my first foray into Nightwish, and though I now own ALL of their US-released albums (but not all imports or DVDs, yet), this easily rates as one of their best.<br /><br />You definitely won't go wrong with this one, but the Nightwish album Once is their best so far. I'd say buy both so you won't miss out.<br /><br />Others have commented on The Gathering and Lacuna Coil. I own their albums, and they are both very much worth listening to, but Nightwish are the best in this \\"genre\\".
B000002J03|5.0|No one with an inkling of taste and knowledge can deny this is an essential part of any music lover's collection . This album covers so many basses. Heavy rock. Blues. Acoustic love songs. It is just perfect in every way, and is so far removed  from all the really dumb heavy metal it evidently inspired. Strip these songs to their basics and they would still blow me away. But as they are, they  add up to something that is genuinly more than the sum of its parts. The soulful singing of Robert Plant. The thunderous drumming of John Bonham. The deft bass playing  courtesy of John Paul Jones ( as underated a musician as there ever was) and the unbelievable guitar playing of Jimmy Page. Even though a few lyrical and musical motifs are borrowed from old blues records ( but doesn't every writer do that?) the Plant/Page songwriting team really hits its stride here.  Rarely will you find a collection of songs like this on one album, something that can truly be called magical. A once in a lifetime thing. If you have yet to take the Zeppelin plunge, this is the place to start.
B0009K7QZ8|2.0|You call this television? This is a horrible show. This show made a REAL true teen series be cancelled. Anyone remember LIFE AS WE KNOW IT?  LAWKI is wayyyy better than this, a so-called television show. The O.C. might have hot guys, I agree, but I would not watch just to watch Mischa Barton make out with a girl. The only good thing about this show is all the cast except Mischa Barton. Mischa Barton is fake also. I like Rachel Bilson and Adam Brody though. They are a cute couple. If you like fake shows, buy this, but if you hate fake California tv shows, make sure you don't buy.
B000002L9M|5.0|This is my second favourite Depeche Mode album. It is miles ahead of their earlier eighties work, as far as songwriting ( there's not a dud song in the bunch ) and production ( they had by then learned to fully incorporate sampling into their work so that it sounds integrated, and not just a gimmick ). This is so much more than just a synth pop album. The lyrical depth is astounding. But what I like best is the fact that roughly half of these songs feature the lovely, tender and emotional lead vocals of Depeche Mode songwriter Martin Gore. I sense more feeling from his vocals than I do Dave Gahan, who tends to over-emote and often ends up sounding bombastic. In fact when I pick out my favourite songs from this cd, they inevitably are sung by Gore. \\"Sometimes\\". \\"A Question of Lust\\". The beautiful \\"It Doesn't Matter Two\\" and \\"World Full of Nothing.\\" All in all, an essential Depeche Mode release and a classic not only of the genre but of popular music in general.

B000002JKA|5.0|I have read all the review posted by MTV Rock and comes to a conclusion.... HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC!!! He only understand MTV. If you study his review, he condamn classical music (Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Bach), classic rock (Led Zep, Deep Purple, Queen), guitar legend (Van Halen, Steve Vai, Ygwie Malmsteen, BB King) and especially prog rock like Dream Theater. I don't think he knows anything about jazz, blues, classical or any other musical style, form, odd timing. He doesn't know how to  judge a good pianist, a good drummer, a good guitarist and especially a good artist. He only knows one thing and that is MTV!!! His brain is made of MTV!!! To say a good album is judged by the sales record is totally suck!!! Why an album can make a good sale record is because of good marketing strategy. In order to make profit, the record company brain wash ppl like MTV Rock and blind them with colourful MTV with cool artist. They don't care about music. They only care about sales.     Dream Theater writes good music and that is for sure. They don't care about MTV or how well their album sales. They care about their music. People who appreciate music like me will listen to their music. Not those crap artist appears in MTV.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I was pleased to see that Webber, an experienced musicial playwright was making his hit musicial, Phantom of the Opera, into a movie. I studied the Phantom of the Opera a couple years back. I read a play, saw a cartoon, and watched the silent movie and musicial from the 70's. It was really interesting.  <br /> <br />The time that the movie came to my town, I was so excited. It was getting close to my birthday and I was so ecstatic to go see the movie, as I was promised. On my birthday, turns out, the movie wasn't playing anymore. So, I never got to see it until now. I am proud to say that it is a great movie, but the musicial is better, I have heard.  <br /> <br />I give this 4 stars. Why not 5 you ask? Because the book is always better! The book, written by Gaston Leroux, is a great buy. I suggest you check the book out if you like this, or anything connected to Phantom.
B000929AJQ|4.0|With Teeth has to be one of NIN's most anticipated releases. News of its release came a few years ago, and he's been releasing news about it ever since earlier this year. It's been six years since the masterpiece The Fragile was released, and it's about time that Trent Reznor released an album. After giving With Teeth several chances, it just doesn't live up to albums such as The Downward Spiral and The Fragile. Yet, it seems like a compilation of Reznor's previous sounds (from Pretty Hate Machine, to The Downward Spiral, to The Perfect Drug, to The Fragile) in addition to a new sound that he has created. <br />There's no doubt in my mind that NIN has found a new sound. With Teeth does not resemble any of his other albums, but at the same time it sounds like he molded With Teeth from all his previous works. There's the techno spirit of Pretty Hate Machine, the violent industrial soul of The Downward Spiral, and the more artistic yet accesible state of mind of The Fragile. All of these sounds are combined with a more mainstream rock spirit. One of the aspects of the album that disappointed me was that there is a lack of variety in With Teeth. Almost all of the songs are very similiar to the last. They aren't duplicates of each other, rather they have the same attitude. Still, With Teeth is enjoyable, even though it doesn't stay true to the NIN norm in my opinion. Overall it is a fairly strong album that does deserve a good deal of credit as being a well-constructed piece, but it just doesn't satisfy the anticipation that was created by waiting for a new NIN release (other than And All That Could Have Been, which was spectacular) for six years. Neither does it satisfy the expectations die-hard NIN fans had for this album, considering the great works that Trent Reznor created prior to With Teeth. It's a good album, but that's all it'll ever be in my eyes. <br />1. All The Love in the World- 9/10- Great song. Great intro.  <br />2. You Know What You Are- 7/10- Definately one of the harder, more industrial songs of With Teeth. Gets a bit grating, but its good.  <br />3. The Collector- 7/10- Sounds similiar to We're In This Together (from The Fragile), as it has a more rock inspired sound. Good, but not as good as We're In This Together. <br />4. The Hands That Feed- 8/10- Has a very satisfying, steady beat that is accompanied by a steady guitar and Reznor's great voice. Great song, but the song gets a little old after a while, especially at the ending. Also blends the signature NIN electronica sounds in there too. <br />5. Love Is Not Enough- 7/10- Starts with a drum'n'bass beat, then leads to guitar (once again). Not a stand-out, but it's a good song.  <br />6. Every Day Is Exactly the Same- 9/10- Probably my favorite song out of With Teeth. It incorporates sounds from Pretty Hate Machine, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile (as well as the sound of With Teeth) into this one song. Good, steady beat with backround guitar that is less active than in most other songs.  <br />7. With Teeth- 6/10- Good song. Should've rated it a 7/10, but the way he says \\"With Teeth\\" in the song annoys the crap out of me. <br />8. Only- 7.5/10- More Pretty Hate Machine than anything, that's for sure. Reznor goes on speaking with the beat rather than singing, while the beat is of a more dance-type, as well as the backround sounds. Of course, there are the other more industrial backround sounds back there too. If you like Pretty Hate Machine, you'll like this song. If you dont, than you obviously wont like this song. <br />9. Getting Smaller- 7/10- This song goes on with a faster, more active beat that is more rock than anything, as with everything else in the song. Good song, not great (once again, as with most songs on With Teeth). <br />10. Sunspots- 7.5/10- Takes on a slower, softer attitude. It retains a more rock influenced sound, but once again it is carefully blended with electronic sounds. It flows very well, you could say.  <br />11. The LinesBegin to Blur- 7.5/10- Half violent, half settled. It is a mixed bag, one half being harsh while the other half is easier to deal with, and it flip flops through each attitude throughout the song. It seems to be the ending chapter of some of the previous songs, such as You Know What You Are? and Every Day Is Exactly The Same, and seems to be an intro to Right Where It Belongs. <br />12. Beside You in Time- 7/10- Part of the lyrics go \\"And on... And on...\\" and so on. Well, that pretty much sums up this song. It goes on and on, doing the same thing. It has a more distorted sound that seems to have more layers than the rest. Not the best songs for those of you who tend to be impatient with continuating songs... But a good prelude to the end of the album. <br />13. Right Where It Belongs- 9/10- This song seems to contain the message of the album. The song starts with electronic sounds leading the beat, and an electronic piano running with the tempo. Just like with Sunspots, it flows. That's how I can describe it. A good ending to the album. It condenses the attitudes and messages of all the other songs into this last one. <br />Strongest Song- Every Day is Exactly the Same <br />Weakest Song- Love Is Not Enough <br />Overall- 7/10
B000099T2L|4.0|I bought this CD and I was expecting something totally different. I was expecting pop music. But this, this is R&B. I love this!! My mom thought it was so good, she stole it from me, lost it, and then bought a new copy for herself and I can only listen to it when I ride in her car with her. She likes \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"The Closer I Get To You\\". I like \\"Baby Boy\\". I give it 4 stars, minus 1 star, for my mom stealing it from me.
0694003611|5.0|A while back I wrote a negative review of this book because I thought it was strange.(I deleted the review only a day or so after writing it, however).  Like some others, I could not see the appeal of this book and didn't understand the particular writing style.  I had read it to my child a few times and then stopped for a while.  <br /> <br />Well, a couple of months ago I started reading this book at bedtime some and guess what - the baby really likes it!  Now if my child likes it, then I cannot help but like it!  He is 13 months old now and this is one of his many favorite books.  It is part of our bedtime routine and is special to me now because I share with him each night.  I am sure when he grows up I will have fond memories of \\"Good Night Moon\\", and may become sad when he thinks he is too old for this story. <br /> <br />Somehow, I do feel it is a sweet little book.  We received 2 copies as gifts - I doubt I would have ever bought it on my own - but it has become a special tradition for us!
0142000655|5.0|Standing in front of monsterous shelves at Border's, staring at my summer reading list with 600 pages of Steinbeck in my hands, I think: \\"My teacher is trying to kill me.\\" That was two years ago.  <br /> <br />If I could pin down any one reason or instance that transformed me from the proverbial couch potato to avid reader, this epic novel would be it.  <br /> <br />Steinbeck's East of Eden is absolutely spacktastuler (yes, so good, I just had to fabricate a word for it). The novel, set in the early 20th century, follows the story of the Trask family. A parallel to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, the conflicts between members of the family in two generations serve to explore the nature of good and evil and mankind's tendencies toward each. Steinbeck is able to envoke deep-seeded, universal questions while stunning the reader with a playful subtleness.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most defined is the developement of character. The reader cannot help but fall in love (or undying disgust)with each of Steinbeck's masterfully crafted personas.  <br /> <br />The book is long - 600 pages in four parts - but every bit the worth and more. The ending, not to be spoiled, even served to leave a beading tear in the eye of this hopeless \\"tough guy.\\"  <br /> <br />Truly a masterpiece of modern times. <br />
0805047905|5.0|A friend read this book to my child, then around 11 months old, while she was babysitting him at her house.  He enjoyed it so much that she gave him a copy for his birthday.  He really likes this book.  I like it because it is quite different from your typical board book/preschool book.  It is a refreshing change of pace from the typical story lines.  My friend, who is a former teacher, says that the repetition is good for children.
0465043550|1.0|This book written by an IBM technician does not convey useful information. Every other page or so, the author re-informs us as to how clever he is and how his theories have revolutionized the world. This book does not support his contentions. He discusses various statistical data that he has studied and concludes that stock prices are very hard to predict. Nothing new there! When he talks about his pioneering work in Economics one is reminded of the recent disclosure that several Nobel-winning economists utilize a run of the mill money market fund to build their retirement nest egg - not an impressive choice of investment vehicle. This is a book that did not deserve to be written.
B000000OQF|5.0|I fist started listening to Guns N' Roses a few months ago and bought their greatest hits cd. It was so good that I needed more GN'R. I bought this album and its excellent! It's awesome heavy metal, but not extremely heavy. I like Axl Rose's Voice and slashes guitar- their awesome! Here's what I rate the songs individually- <br /> <br />Welcome to the jungle 5/5 <br />It's so easy 5/5 <br />Nightrain 5/5 <br />Out ta get me 4/5 <br />Mr. Brownstone 5/5   Best song on the CD!! <br />Paradise City 5/5  <br />My Michelle 5/5 <br />Think about you 4/5 <br />Sweet Child O' Mine 5/5 <br />You're Crazy 5/5 <br />Anything Goes 4/5 <br />Rocket Queen 4/5 <br /> <br />The only thing that's bad about this cd is sometimes the language and other offensive lyrics. Otherwise it's the best cd I've heard in a long while. BUY APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This film starts off well but slowly becomes more formulaic as the film comes to its conclusion. <br /> <br />Not taking anything away from the actors, Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are both Magnificent as the consciencious taxi driver and the cool cold blooded killing machine. <br /> <br />The story is as follows: a taxi driver picks up a fare from a Businessman, who claims he has to make 5 stops to tie up estate dealings. Foxx is bribed into this with a cool 600 dollers and everything looks innocent enough until....well Foxx finds out that Cruise is a contract killer and plays a good part as the taxi driver who has a crisis of conscience, should he risk his own life to save that of other innocent people?  <br /> <br />On the way there is minor involvement from Cruises boss 'Felix' and the FBI, but the main part of the film is the interaction between Cruise and Foxx. <br /> <br />Unfortunately its impossible for me to say how the film gets formulaic without spoling the ending. Anyway its well worth a rental but not a classic action film to add to your collection <br /> <br />*************Spolier****************** <br /> <br /> <br />The best Review ive read of this is SinisterFiend, because too many of these reviews concentrate on the brilliant acting, and not enough on the fact that the interaction Foxx has with that woman is obviously going to esculate into some ridiculous cat and mouse chase between the killer and the hero, with his token woman.  <br />     Also how could cruise not take foxx out? Foxx didnt look too adept with the handgun (forgetting to take the safety off is a sure sign). <br />     theres also no background on the killings except that they might be quite important. In short i was left dissapointed with the ending.
B000750OEA|4.0|as a fairly new Kylie fan, it was a lot of fun for me to see most of her videos for the first time ever, one after the other! The early videos are really embarrasing, especially \\"The Locomotion\\", but some of them have their charm like \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" and \\"Got To Be Certain\\". I really didn't like that my favorite Kylie song ever, \\"Better The Devil You Know\\", is represented here with such AWFUL sound quality. I'm not kidding, it's really bad. I don't understand why they couldn't just dub over it with the track from the Ultimate Kylie CD or something. Some of the early videos aren't in great quality either, \\"Especially\\" for you suffers ffrom too much brightness and contrast. Or maybe that's how the video was originally shot..?? But anyway, it's great to see Kylie's evolution, although i would have loved to have seen \\"Finer Feelings\\" and \\"Some Kind of Bliss\\" included.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I wish I could say  better things about this record. I sadly cannot. Madonna tries to be the hip artist like Britney Spears and JLo, among others. <br />Why does she try so hard here??? <br />It really sounds forced.  <br />Britney and JLo are the new superstars of now. <br />Madonna isn't in the news any longer, or in the same category. Guess it's time to move on.

B000001Y42|5.0|I refuse to let the average of this album drop as low as their new releases because of stupid reviewers who just hate LB in GENERAL, but know nothing about this album.  Giving every LB album 1 star due to their later embarrassments might seem like a good idea, but anyone who actually gives this a listen will realize they had a lot of musical potential, and not even Fred could ruin the music on this album.  Even if you hate his vocals, the lyrics on this album aren't quite as mind-numbingly stupid as later CDs.  In fact, I think he only says the name \\"Limp Bizkit\\" once on the whole album, they weren't famous yet, so he couldn't talk about them being so.  This album has nostalgic value for me, as I used to listen to it all the time, I still find it enjoyable today.<br /><br />In conclusion, I very much agree with the Wickerman's \\"they had potential\\" review.  LB has a very unique melodic style.  The only difference between our opinions is I find the album more tolerable.
B00006EXDM|4.0|I am not a die-hard Stones fan, but I believe that their place in rock history is valid and they represent one of many facets of a very diversified musical genre.  There are so many styles out there:  art rock, goth rock, acid rock, etc., but the Stones represent an aspect that everyone needs to acknowledge now and then, and that would be good time, down-to-earth raunchy blues rock.  That's not to say they didn't do some great ballads, but what would you rather play at a party; \\"As Tears Go By\\" or \\"Honky Tonk Women?\\"<br /><br />The band had so many great hits, especially during the 64-71 era, and this represents all the best of them.  Beside that, I maintain an eternal weakness for the great classic \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\"  You can play that anywhere and blow any young kid who thinks they're cool out of the water because it's that full of attitude after all these years.  The best thing about it is that it's not even aggressive compared to songs like \\"Brown Sugar.\\"  Now that's coolness defined.  Get Hot Rocks for all the great songs you know and the album rock stations some of us were lucky enough to grow up with.  Also, you may want to get Forty Licks or Some Girls for great later classics like \\"Beast of Burden\\" and \\"Waiting on a Friend.\\"  A little Stones go a long way for some of us, but they're still around, and they're still cool, so have fun!
B000696PWC|4.0|Although she may be considered by many young Americans as the one-hit wonder responsible for \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" Kylie Minogue is a monstrously successful diva overseas, and literally the closest thing to Madonna Europe has ever concocted. She has scored seven #1 UK singles, and many more that cracked the Top 10. She has only had two truly notable hits in the U.S., however-her fluffy cover of \\"The Loco-Motion\\" and of course the aforementioned \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" the biggest single of her career (although \\"Love At First Sight\\" and \\"Slow\\" also received minimal airplay on American radio, shortly after their release). Those more familiar with Minogue will know that she has already released more hits collections that you can shake a stick at-but this is, without a single doubt, her best yet. Containing every single one of the big hits and almost all of the smaller ones, 'Ultimate Kylie' lives up to its title, unless you are a total diehard fan, in which case you might be upset over the absences of minimal singles such as \\"Finer Feelings,\\" \\"Some Kind Of Bliss,\\" \\"What Kind Of Fool,\\" and \\"It's No Secret.\\" Such petty missteps, however, do little, if not nothing, to bring down such a stellar collection (I am not fantastically fond of the missing singles, anyhow). The first disc covers the first half of Kylie's career (although nothing here is in chronological order, one other minor mistake). A warning to those who discovered Kylie through her more recent music: you may like and you may loathe her earlier hits, because they are devastatingly different in both sound and structure. Her cotton candy-sweet debut UK smash, \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" should make the first disc's intentions pretty clear. Many of these early hits were released in the 80's-meaning they tend to be ridiculously silly, embarrassingly cheesy, fluffily sugary, hollowly produced, and sometimes downright annoying. But then again, the 80's *was* the decade of silly, innocuous pop divas, sowho can blame her (this was also a time when she was fed all of her material by writers and producers). And besides, who doesn't love a little airy 80's fun every once in a while? The first CD is at its best in very small doses, however, as the vapid lyrics and overtly 80's sound can grate after a few tracks. Though \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" was a #1 UK hit, and though \\"The Loco-Motion\\" is likely the second-biggest hit of Kylie's career, the 80's gem here would have to be \\"Better The Devil You Know,\\" whose flashy, sunny sound and infectious chorus should soften up even the most aggressively modernized listener. \\"Shocked\\" is also a sweet, synth-soaked ride, and her take on \\"Celebration\\" is some cutesy fun. So if you're in the mood for some brainless, 80's-fabulous fun, go ahead and pop in disc 1. But if you truly want to hear Miss Minogue at her very best, I'd give the second CD a try first. It kicks off with the sparkling new single, \\"I Believe In You.\\" This glitzy disco anthem is one of the compilation's biggest highlights-it provides catchy hooks and verses, as well as lovely production and a sweetly happy feel. Then comes the monster smash I'm sure you've all heard before, being mentioned once again ladies and gentlemen, \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head.\\" It pulsates, percolates and thumps in a way hardly anything else here does, and creates a dancefloor urgency like nothing else Kylie's ever recorded. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is also wonderful, one of Kylie's best singles. It is absolutely infectious, and the production is perfect. The random track listing is almost overly damaging at this point, as it is too disorienting jumping back and forth from the electric techno-funk of `Body Language' to the glamorous, effervescent, polished dance pop of `Fever' to the fumbling trip-hop of `Impossible Princess' to the guitar-heavy pop rock of \\"Kids\\" (which is why I took the liberty of arranging the tracks in my preferred order on my iPod). The bouncy, club-friendly \\"Love At First Sight\\" is followed by the tacky mid-tempo \\"Slow,\\" lead single off `Body Language' and a UK #1. This literally sounds like it sampled an Atari soundtrack. Despite its simple, underdone production, however, the song does have a strangely unique appeal to it-and like Madge herself, Kylie seems to very often reinvent herself in both image and sound, so it's a little unfair to always expect the same. It is fairly hooky and the lyrics are just silly, so the track is definitely fun on occasion. \\"On A Night Like This\\" is, in my opinion, the best single off `Light Years.' It begins strong, and the thumping beat is quite danceable. \\"Spinning Around\\" is some dancefloor fun, but didn't live up to the hype-it isn't as catchy as \\"On A Night Like This.\\" Kylie's duet with Robbie Williams, \\"Kids,\\" just feels weird, cobbled in with clubby dance pop like this. It is an average song, however, and has an alright hook. \\"Confide In Me\\" has a beautifully hypnotic opening sequence in its album version, but the radio edit here hacks it out. It does have a unique, Middle-Eastern feel to it, but it gets so caught up in the trance-like sound and overproduced beat, the hook just gets lost in the muddle and the track becomes frenetic. \\"In Your Eyes\\" was the second single from `Fever,' and though it isn't nearly as addictive as the other three, it is a very nice dance song. Quite catchy, and the heavy beat will get you on your feet in a jiffy. \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" is the closest thing to hip hop Kylie's ever done-and surprisingly, it works. In fact, it's quite an excellent song in and of itself. The chorus is very catchy, and the backing track suits the tune. This is another highlight of the second disc, and possibly the best single off `Body Language.' \\"Chocolate\\" is here in its polished radio version, and it sounds gorgeous. It is by far Kylie's best ballad (although it's just barely a `ballad'), as she captures a perfectly, classily sensual mood here, and the chorus is very catchy. The endingis great. \\"Come Into My World\\" was a great song in its original form, but this remixed radio version is simply amazing, and proves itself to be Kylie's best single. The thumping beat is infectious, the production is polished and perfect, and Kylie's breathy vocals make the chorus simply mesmerizing. This is a truly irresistible song, and those who enjoyed Kylie's American hits should really give it a try-you might have a new favorite Minogue song! Unfortunately, things tumble treacherously downhill from there, the only tolerable track afterwards being the unique \\"Breathe.\\" The second disc ends terribly, with the train wreck of a ballad \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow.\\" Regardless, all of Kylie's best singles are here, all present in their cleaned up radio forms. Though dance pop does seem to be her specialty (`Fever' was her best album and her best phase), Kylie has experimented so thoroughly that she even became an indie darling in Europe in the 90's, and though she usually keeps things frilly, songs like \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Did It Again,\\" \\"Confide In Me,\\" and \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\" prove that she has a darker side and a darker sound-and like Madonna, she did a bit of bumpy soul-searching and self-reflection in the mid-90's (when she did more ballads and had more angst in her lyrics), ultimately maturing her into the marvelously confident dance diva she is today. I take off a star because of the poor track ordering, not providing the full-length versions of a few good songs, a simple dissatisfaction with some of the first disc's fluff, and somewhat skimpy packaging, considering the price-there are no new pictures, just a quick biography, nine pages of old pictures, and the credits. If possible, get the import version, which at least lists the songs in chronological order. But all in all, this is a wonderful collection, and the only package to buy if you're a casual Kylie fan. Enjoy the unique, wild, and sometimes wonderful musical world of Kylie Minogue.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|This album was recommended to me by a friend and, after sampling the tracks, I ordered it immediately.  Honestly, I'm not all that familiar with Billie Holliday, but Peyroux has a voice that harkens back to song stylists that are virtually extinct in this day and age.  Dreamland seemed a bit crosseyed to me at times, but Careless Love is a vast improvement and so well done, she should be fierce competition for rivals such as Norah Jones and Diana Krall.  In fact, Peyroux's got the distinct advantage of being able to whisk one back to the golden days of Hollywood and an era before the Beatles broke up the unified term of \\"show business\\" with her cool, smokey delivery. In fact, some of these songs sound like Doris Day would have covered them, such as the opening track, \\"Dance Me to the End of Love.\\"<br /><br />With a wide range of material that includes blues, jazz, and some country, the album manages to be cohesive without one track ever sounding alien to the others.  It has a very nice easy pace, and something to listen to no matter what you're doing--relaxing, cleaning the house, driving or--well, we won't go there--this is a lovely contemporary album by an artist who pays hearty respect to her predecessors, and it's something we need to see a lot more of in this day and age.
B000056K04|4.0|Dave Matthews Band introduces a slightly new sound on Everyday. They leave the lengthy jam-band songs behind for shorter, pop-produced pieces, partly due to working with a new producer and co-writer, Glen Ballard, who has worked with Alanis Morissette, Aerosmith, and No Doubt.  <br /> <br />Unlike previous Dave Matthews Band recordings, Matthews is the obvious front man, with few improvisational solos from band members Boyd Tinsley (violinist), Leroi Moore (saxophone), Stefan Lessard (bass), and Carter Beauford (drummer). The addition of the electric guitar heard throughout the tracks is another first for this group. Even with these changes, the album is eminent and has a intimate, casual, melodic vibe. <br /> <br />The first track \\"I Did It\\" starts with a frisky, aggressive, punchy electric guitar lick that sets the tone for the fresh Dave Matthews Band sound. It has been argued this song is about the band selling out to create more radio-friendly pop tunes: \\"I did it, do you think I've gone too far, I did it, guilty as charged,\\" sings Matthews, begging the question. Another energy-driven track \\"So Right\\" has a catchy electric guitar riff followed by a potent, resonant saxophone that flows throughout the vigorous song. <br /> <br />Matthews brings back the acoustic guitar and accompanies it with a wistful saxophone and dreamy piano for \\"Angel.\\" The enticing harmonies of the chorus and empathetic lyrics (\\"When you're not here love, it's hard to pretend\\") make it the best heart-rending ballad on the album. <br /> <br />Several of the songs on Everyday focus on love and relationships. The subtle serenade \\"When the World Ends\\" is an atypical love song about being with the one you love during the destruction of civilization: \\"We will rise as the building's crumble, midst the burning we'll be churning.\\"  <br /> <br />Everyday is an impressive album with captivating, compassionate songs that caress the ears.
B0000028M7|5.0|&quot;Dirt&quot; by Alice In Chains released in 1992<BR>13 songs<BR>57 music of the best metal music ever recorded in the 90's<BR>Very consistent in all areas (guitars, vocals, drums, etc.)<BR>This is not a mainstream album but if you prefer basic hard rock there were 5 singles off of this album<BR>   - Them Bones, Down In A Hole, Rooster, Angry Chair, and Would?<BR>Other outstanding tracks include Rain When I Die, Sickman, and the title track.<br />&quot;Dirt&quot; works very well because of the thunderous rhythm section and Cantrell's distorted guitar playing along with Staley's vocals. <br />Comparing Staley to Cobain since its inevitable, Cobain may have had a better sense of craft which gained him more mainstream appeal, but Staley is a better songwriter and vocalist.<br />Alice In Chains was the premier metal band of the 90's.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When Rage Against the Machine's political front man Zack de la Rocha left the group in 2000, former band mates Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk moved on with grunge vocalist Chris Cornell of Soundgarden. This new super-group became Audioslave. Their self-titled debut album mixes Rage Against the Machine's hardcore guitar riffs with Chris Cornell's distinct sonorous vocals and obfuscating religious lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Show Me How To Live\\" is about not being perfect and how to live the life God wants us to. Chris Cornell pleads with God in the explosive chorus, \\"Nail in my hand/From my creator/You gave me life/Now show me how to live.\\" The track has a belligerent, fuming rhythm section accompanied by robust guitar chord progressions. <br /> <br />Audioslave slows it down on \\"Shadow of the Sun,\\" a melancholic track about people who don't believe in God. Cornell reveals, \\"I can tell you why/The end will never come/Nothing but a hole/To live without a soul.\\" The longing mournful guitar evokes feelings of the sadness of life without God, and the solid bass line echoes the anguish that can come from an empty soul. Tom Morello divulges the listener with his sheer guitar playing talents throughout the album. \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" features Morello's signature high-pitched eccentric guitar style and is one of the best solos on the album.  <br /> <br />The songs \\"Gasoline,\\" \\"Cochise,\\" and \\"Set it Off\\" are all hard-rock meets alternative grunge, which is the expected outcome of blending Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden.  These tracks have a pure grooving energy and are sure to cause some serious head-banging.  <br /> <br />Audioslave's self-titled debut is a precursor to what could become a legendary group. Unlike many of the bands out there, every Audioslave member has prodigious raw talent. The merging of these talents is exquisitely portrayed and the listener cannot help but indulge every song.
B0006399FS|5.0|Ok...This is an awesome album. If you don't like it then you must be deaf and or stupid.
B00006879E|2.0|Do you \\"really\\" wanna hear White guys who \\"can\\" really sing??! Listen to the legendary band \\"Chicago,\\" or \\"Michael McDonald,\\" or \\"Hall & Oates,\\" or \\"The Doors,\\" or \\"Three Dog Night,\\" or even Barry Manilow!! <br /> <br />But with Maroon 5... <br /> <br />What is it with all the (predominantly) White girls in American that like White guys with whiny sounding voices?? This is just as bad as gangsta' rap and teeny-bopper music.  <br /> <br />For the life of me, I still can't understand (well, I do, but I won't go into Communication theory on here) why people listen to this insipid music. <br /> <br />I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. True, they are not as bad as the Britney clones: Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simpson, Jessica Simpson, Jesse McCartney, or Avril Lavigne et al. <br /> <br />But, this music cannot and will not stand on its own. There was once a time when \\"true\\" R & B funk ruled, and no not this Maroon 5 that gets past off as R & B. What about Teena Marie singing her funk and fun anthem, \\"Square Biz\\" ? Or Taylor Dayne's vocals searing and soaring to unparalleled levels in \\"I'll Be Your Shelter,\\" or \\"Prove Your Love\\" ? <br /> <br />Maroon 5 and their copycats should take a clue and quit ruining the landscape of music or else there will be no turning back. Don't even get me started on Britney. If she were on American Idol (as if that would happen) she'd be laughed at and booed off the stage!  *Sigh* But don't tell that to her millions of fans.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Different? Yes. But that's not a bad thing. \\"Mezmerize\\" offers more than most cranky SOAD fans are giving them credit for. There's not a single song on the CD I'm not fond of, so I'll cut right to the chase: <br /> <br />1) Soldier Side (Intro) - Poignant, beautiful intro into an amazing album. It almost gives the listener a perspective of what it'd be like being out on the battlefield, watching people all around you fall down one by one. 5/5 <br />2) BYOB - Nice surge into music here from the intro. First single and definitely a new direction for the band, with an almost hip-hop chorus. 4/5 <br />3) Revenga - Already one of my favorites. The fast-paced singing reminds me alot of Serj's older vocals. Great music job done here as it progresses. 4/5 <br />4) Cigaro - Actually, it's not even one of my favorites here. It's good, but after maybe 10 listens, it doesn't live up to the rest of the album, in my opinion. 2/5 <br />5) Radio/Video - One of everyone's favorites off the album, and definitely one of mines. The guitaring reminds me of an Italian Pizzeria for some reason. Daron \\"lalalala\\"ing towards the end is classic. 5/5 <br />6) This Cocaine.. - It took me awhile to get into this song, but when I did get into it, I loved it dearly. I love the experimentation done by Serj here. His vocals switch off from different keys and styles, it's great. 5/5 <br />7) Violent Pornography - When I first heard the album, this is the song that stuck on me. Especially \\"It's a non-stop disco, I bet you it's Nabisco, I bet you didn't know. WOOHOO.\\" 5/5 <br />8) Question! - A beautiful, brilliant song that does somewhat remind me of Suggestions. Amazing ending. Once you think the song is over, it gets loud again. 5/5 <br />9) Sad Statue - Most likely my favorite on the album, if I had to choose. It's powerful, political and delivers its message clearly. The line \\"What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering?\\" has stuck with me. 5/5 <br />10) Old School Hollywood - Everyone's been talking about the sound effects used in this one. It's good to see SOAD experimenting with new things. I cannot, though, figure out what this song is talking about. Baseball? Washed out stars? 4/5 <br />11) Lost in Hollywood - One of those songs you just want to wave your hands around to. Daron takes control in this song, and I wouldn't want it any other way. The man shows you he can sing. The melancholic lines are just amazing. Excellent way to end the album. <br /> <br />I got the album the day it came out in Burbank, where I was hoping to meet the band. Unfortunatly, I had to leave early and didn't. Just listening to this album washed the disappointment away. I cannot wait for \\"Hypnotize\\", as I'm sure all SOAD fans are looking forward to that.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|this is the suckiest cd they have released so far, it was not what I expected, it has only a couple of good songs, in my opinion, the other 3 cd's I love them from the first to last song, so if you know somebody that has it, burn it instead and save your money.
0446677450|4.0|A fresh perspective to common sense information. At one point or another the ideas from this book have come across your mind or mentioned in your many conversations.  Robert was smart enough to be the one to condense it attractively on a silver platter for us enjoy.  Recommended.
0385335482|5.0|This book was so entertaining and it kept my interest the whole time. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a comical and entertaining book.
0060179872|5.0|Finally a professional biography, which does such elementary but necessary scholarship as comparing the Kennedy brothers' appointment books with Monroe's to show how miniscule the contact was. Compares accounts in previous bios with verifiable facts. (The outrageous way con-men fabricate and market a dead hero's story could make a separate book.) As Mr. Spoto documents Marilyn Monroe's endless small generosities and quirks, she becomes more lovable than one had dared to hope. Marilyn had an uncanny ability to awaken our protective instincts, and at the end, when Miller is cold and her therapist exploiting, Mr. Spoto grows furious. Otherwise, the first objective biography of this American culture hero: all serious criticism must now start with it. George J. Leonard, Prof of Humanities, San Francisco State University
B000654YRY|4.0|I had the privilege of seeing Dire Straits three times during their \\"On Every Street\\" tour, from which this DVD was taken. I have previously seen the VHS and cable broadcast versions of this concert, and while there is more material found elsewhere, the quality of the DVD production is substantially better, although it is a bit of a travesty to see a Dire Straits show without \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" as others have pointed out.<br /><br />It pains me to give any Dire Straits production less than five stars, but I gave this DVD four for a couple of reasons, the most obvious being the obviously questionable editing of the set list. My other reason is a bit more related to this particular tour: the band got away from their roots and became a mammoth production with up to nine people onstage in some of the numbers which, for me, tended to obscure the music in some places (I got particularly tired of the excessive pedal steel guitar work on many of the songs.) That's personal preference, of course, and others love the larger orchestrations.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a good DVD, although it really doesn't capture the energy of Dire Straits in concert as well as some other productions, including the much earlier, and generally superior, \\"Alchemy,\\" which will hopefully be released on DVD soon.
0316743003|5.0|<br />Though as a whole, \\"Skunk Works\\" pertains to the aviation industry, this book delves far deeper, covering not only the inception, design and construction of aircraft at 'Skunk Works' but also explaining the events that influenced the development of these aircraft.  Specifically, the U-2, SR-71 (including details of its reconnaissance flights and missions), F-117A \\"Stealth Fighter\\" and the Stealth Ship are covered in depth, while other aircraft, both those of Lockheed origin and those of other builders, are mentioned.  Telling comments and short narratives from various former pilots, 'Skunk Works' employees and government employees (i.e., Secretaries of Defense, Air Force, etc.) are included as well. <br /> <br />  For myself, highlights included the in depth coverage of the development of the SR-71 Blackbird; most notably the myriad of problems and technological hurdles that were overcome in order to build this famous aircraft.  While it is relatively well-known that the Blackbird was constructed primarily of titanium from Russia, another link to Russia surfaces in the \\"Have Blue\\" program, which led to the F-117 Nighthawk / Stealth Fighter.  Though it sounds a bit corny, the entire book was astoundingly fascinating. <br /> <br />This book solidifies the comprehensive genius of both Kelly Johnson and Ben Rich, along with numerous other less famous names associated with and/or involved in the design and construction of some of the world's most advanced aircraft.
0140177396|5.0|I loved the dialog in this story. The southern accent was modeled beautifully. I'm amazed how Steinbeck created such realistic characters in such a short novel (I think it's considered a novel). The ending nearly made my heart stop. I did not see it coming. Highly recommended.
B000929AJQ|5.0|\\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. I have bought every Nine Inch Nails EP and album since then, only to be disappointed. But \\"With Teeth\\" is great! Trent Reznor's lyrics are as crisp as ever - with the same themes of losing himself. The beats are pounding, and the melodies are memorable.  <br /> <br />I'm surprised by the reviews that pan this album. It is a true return to NIN's origins. <br /> <br />Check it out!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Holy s**t, this album must be a joke. The guitar playing totally sucks, and the vocals are just so f**king stupid. B.Y.O.B. is the most played song and the stupid part in it where the singer goes: \\"La la la la\\" is just hilariously ridiculous. Sorry, but this CD sucks.
B000002H2Z|4.0|\\"Head on the Door\\" is the first of four consecutive albums that are probably The Cure's best (\\"Head on the Door,\\" \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me,\\" \\"Disintegration\\" and \\"Wish\\").  What is unique about \\"Head on the Door\\" is the diversity of the songs, which are all written solely by Robert Smith, the life force of The Cure.   <br /> <br />\\"In Between Days\\" is a danceable pop oriented song, reminiscent of New Order, which was basically re-made on the subsequent album into the slightly superior \\"Just Like Heaven.\\"  \\"Kyoto Song,\\" with its Asian flavor, takes us back to \\"Japanese Whispers.\\"  \\"The Blood\\" (a tribute to Latin music) and \\"Six Different Ways\\" (with a circus-like feel) are quite unlike anything else the band has done, and fit perfectly on this album.  \\"Push\\" and \\"The Baby Screams\\" are dramatic songs, though without the desolation and despair that The Cure became famous for with the release of \\"Pornography.\\"  For fans of that prior album, \\"Head on the Door\\" includes the final track \\"Sinking,\\" which you will find sufficiently depressing. <br /> <br />I'm fairly sure that most Cure fans would agree that \\"Screw\\" is easily the weakest track on the album, but one bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch.  I also never really cared for \\"Close to Me,\\" but I usually don't like the \\"silly\\" side of the band.  <br /> <br />And then there's \\"A Night Like This.\\"  Bum - Bum Bum - Bum Bum - Bum Bum - \\"Say goodbye on a night like this if its the last thing we ever do . . .\\"  It almost sounds like an overture of a dramatic Broadway musical.  The saxophone solo is extraordinarily moving as is the entire song.  The song is still a highlight at Cure Concerts and, I believe it to be one of the best songs the band has ever recorded. <br /> <br />\\"Head on the Door\\" is a good \\"starter\\" Cure album (as is their first greatest hits collection) because it shows the different sides of the band, and the songwriting versatility of Robert Smith.  Obviously, it's a \\"must-have\\" for fans.
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence is a pretty Great band (especially the vocals)! I myself thought they did agreat job on songs like: Fallen, My Immortal, and Haunted, but some of the other songs are weaker for my taste. If you buy the Daredevil sound track you get Fallen, feat. The 12 Stones, which puts a little more rock into the song. You can also find My Immortal on the same cd. I'm not saying not to buy this cd, it all depends on your taste of music. Also if you buy The Punisher sound track you get the song Broken by Seether and Amy Lee the vocals of Evanescence. <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|This album erases all doubts about this Kanye West's \\"supposed\\" second fiddle. This is a new side to John Legend (born John Stephens), an image of pure GENIUS! \\"Get Lifted\\" portrays originality; he sings about real issues and his lyrics are deep! He deviates from the normal R&B song \\"just-for-the-ladies\\", and is more focused on the typical male with typical male issues....such as infidelity,love, uncertainty and human imperfections.  <br /> <br />On all the tracks, Legend gives a heart-wrenching delivery and sings with so much passion and soul that you are immediately taken on a journey through his mind. His sounds have a rich layered texture with romantic, humorous and even spiritual undertones. It not difficult to tell that like most other talented R&B singers, he was musically trained in a church. The balance between hip-hop and gospel is what made this album stand out. This is especially shown in Track 7 \\"I can change\\" featuring Snoop Dogg. <br /> <br />Highlights of his album are:  <br />Track 8 \\"Ordinary people\\", Brilliant track. At least ONE line from this song would relate to you. I can't get enough of it; looks like my local radio station can't either!   <br />Track 12, \\"Refuge (when it's cold outside)\\", this is my personal favorite.  <br />Track 3 \\"Used to Love you\\"  <br />Track 5 \\"She don't have to change\\" <br /> <br />He'll definitely be sticking around for a while. John Legend isn't going anywhere. If he does, then I might have to eat my hat.... <br />
B0000027RL|5.0|August 27th, 1991 - Pearl Jam released the revolutionary 'Ten'   September 24th, 1991 - Nirvana released the \\"revolutionary\\" 'Nevermind'     Another one for the ages in the classic example of one album vs. another - It's an argument to go along beside 'London Calling' vs. 'Nevermind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols' - 'Pet Sounds' vs. 'Sgt. Peppers' - 'Led Zeppelin 4' vs. 'Dark Side of the Moon' etc.. etc..     I have opinions regarding those albums that can be bent & changed depending on my mood - What cannot be changed is my opinion of 'Ten' vs. 'Nevermind' -     The Seattle revolution was praised for changing the music scene from hair metal, to honest rock n roll again - Nirvana getting most of this praise since they got big first, & afterwards with Pearl Jam getting big months later - In modern times, unfourtantely, the hype & legend of this scene has covered many points in reality that the music at the time was so praised for - Nirvana was thought of as revolutionary, nothing like 'Nevermind' was released before... right?     Wrong.     - The Pixies. A band that combined the spirit of punk rock with basslines & drum beats wrapped around the guitars in a style not heard before.. the Pixies, while critically acclaimed, were not a well known band - Kurt Cobain, however, was one of their devoted listeners.. aswell as their biggest thief - He claimed that if it wasnt for 'Doolittle', Nevermind wouldve never been made... can't argue with the man there, he's right... 'Nevermind' is a blatant rip-off of 'Doolittle', aswell as 'Surfa Rosa'     Nirvana basically took the exact same style of song writing & technique the Pixies invented, & made it mainstream... since the mainstream listening public is well known to be ignorant sheep, they hailed it as being \\"a revolutionary sound\\" - thereby annoying the christ out of all Pixies' lovers such as myself -     So why did music critics acclaim 'Nevermind' then? - Guess what? THEY DIDNT - Rolling Stone magazine gave 'Nevermind' an average 3 stars for their effort ('Ten' got 4 stars)... it was only after the ignorant mainstream public loved 'Nevermind' to death, that it started becoming trendy to critically acclaim the album - It wasnt acclaimed from the beginning such as 'OK Computer' (whats that? it wasnt acclaimed because it was such a new sound? Bad argument. So was 'OK Computer' & it was acclaimed before it was released)     Kurt was worshipped as being so \\"real\\"... guess what?     Not really.     the song 'Something in the Way' was reportedly written after Kurt was living under a bridge... Kurt NEVER lived under a bridge - He lied.. he was kicked out of his house when he was about to be intimate with a girl, & lived with friends for a while - Thats the true story, nothing dark, or sensitive.. just another case of the legend overshadowing the actual truth     Here's some truth...     the Pearl Jam song 'Release', written by Eddie Vedder, was a song he wrote about the death of his real father he never knew was his real father.. his mom never told him - This is a REAL song.. REAL emotion.. a TRUE story - not a legend, or a myth, just the truth.. also 'Alive' is based after the same story - Metaphorically believing his mom \\"raped\\" him     Whereas Kurt seemed to keep things more self-centered in songs such as the simple-minded repetitive 'Lithium' & .. oh hell, every other song off Nevermind except 'Polly'... Eddie was writing songs reflecting the state of the world, in songs such as 'Jeremy', 'Even Flow', & 'Why Go?'       Pearl Jam were original. No band sounded like Pearl Jam before Pearl Jam did - Sure.. Eddie had Jim Morrison type vocals, but thats as far of an influence you could hear through their music... anyone familiar with the Pixies, heard a blatant rip-off of the Pixies in Nirvana....     Nirvana were not original. They were rip-offs. As much of rip-offs as Puddle of Mudd is to Nirvana, only Pixies were way less known - To further prove this fact, the amazon editorial review writes, 'Thousands of albums have tried to copy 'Nevermind's style\\" - Hey.. maybe they WERENT, maybe the bands thought of as trying to copy Neverminds style, were just ALSO heavily influenced by the Pixies     Please listen to the song 'Gouge Away' off Doolittle (pixies) - & in that song, you'll hear every song Nirvana ever wrote summed up into one song.     Eddie Vedder wrote songs revolving around things that actually happened to him.. way more personal songs - & when he didnt, he wrote about songs for the state of the world -     Kurt Cobain hardly wrote about songs he actually lived - In fact, their biggest hit, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was a song Kurt wrote about having friends....     A[...] how sweet...     Party music.     Whereas Kurt insulted hair metal bands, he also cited hair metal leaders such as 'Van Halen' as huge influences...(anyone else notice that people who bought 'Nevermind' also bought 'Appetite for Destruction'?     - In the end...     Pearl Jam were always a more honest, & revolutionary sounding band than Nirvana... Kurts death overshadowed this, & he became a legend with fables told about him... theres no fables about Pearl Jam (except their name).. theyre just a true band.. & often times, non-fiction is much more amazing than fiction.. Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana is a case of this     ***** BUY THESE 2 GREATEST HITS ALBUMS ******     1) Pearl Jam's 'Rearviewmirror'   2) The Pixies' 'Wave of Mutilation'     Kurt hated Pearl Jam's music? Well guess what Kurt - Black Francis of the Pixies, your biggest idol, hated YOUR music as I read in Blender magazine recently (& why not? it was just a watered down version of the music his band already made before)    FACT: Kurt called MTV behind the scenes, & told them to play more Nirvana music videos     FACT: Pearl Jam quit making MTV music videos     & people think Nirvana was so rebelious? ha..     In closing, I'd like to say anyone who connects with 'Nevermind' more than 'Ten' (even if is more popular) - & anyone who connects with \\"songs about friends\\" more than the epic Pearl Jam's 'Black' - Is about as rebelious & has as much emotional depth as a bottle cap.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Closer struck me as a cross between Anna Karenina, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and modern society, cinematised. It's unusual; that much is certain. It has four characters, most unlikable, though Natalie Portman gives her character a charm that merits her Oscar nomination.  <br /> <br />The film is undeniably explicit and confronting, and, for an eighteen year old, watching it with one's parents is not quite ideal. The script is lined with a very sexual vocabulary, more so than, perhaps, any other film I have seen thus far. My parents thought this was unnecessarily explicit, while I felt it gave the film's relationships more grit and complexity.  <br /> <br />Closer entices and repels simultaneously, drawing the viewer's interest whilst pushing away their sympathies. It is littered with beauty, and a kind of gritty, repulsive sort of tragedy, the result being something that does not glorify the ugly, but that captures the complexity of life, with its sprinklings of whimsy amongst the ashes of grotesquery.  <br /> <br />All in all, Closer is art. It has artistic sensibilities and tone to it, and should be viewed not for entertainment, nor as beauty, but for the simply astounding clash of experiences it offers.  <br />
B0000630BT|5.0|I bought this Cd when it first came out, and was totally blown away. I was 20 or 21 when it came out, now I'm 34 and I still love it. This cd will never be duplicated and thank god, why would you want that. What would be nice is a replication of the intensity and feeling behind the writing. <br /> <br />If you love or simply like Judas Priest this is one cd that should be in your collection, period!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I've listening to this collection over the past week now and<br /><br />this one is right up there with the best of his solo projects.<br /><br />Sure he's getting older(56) and shows his years on his face<br /><br />but face the facts Robert Plant still sings rings around most<br /><br />half his age, thats why he IS A LEGEND, he doesn't have to do<br /><br />this, its in his blood. Reviewers that  give<br /><br />this one star, well consider their musical tastes? From start<br /><br />to finish this ones a classic, Plant took his time to deliver<br /><br />this and his new band adds many surprises, paints some classic<br /><br />memories.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|This is about the best that sophomoric humor gets. You know all the basics by now: it's marionettes, bumbling fighters for some kind of justice, and R-rated for - well, for lots of good reasons.<br /><br />It's also insanely funny. This is decidedly a product of Pres. Bush II, and generally lampoons the West Man's Burden that the US has taken on itself. It also ribs just about every stereotype around, using both its musical pieces (\\"Lonely\\" and \\"Montage\\" had me rolling) and its send-ups of dozens of other movies. Those included the original Thunderbirds TV show, Charlie's Angels, The Karate Kid, James Bond, The Matrix, and bunches of others. I couldn't always pick out a specific film being lampooned, but the mood was familiar and true whether or not I knew what it satirized.<br /><br />Two facts really stuck out in watching this. First was how well the puppets and scenes (wait for Il's panthers!) were put together. Second was that appreciation of the crude humor (gross-outs, homophobia, and all) split my viewing room down the middle, male vs. female. I spent a fair bit of time trying to explain why the country-western lyrics were so riotous. Have you ever tried to explain a joke? It was one of those, but bad.<br /><br />It's the best \\"adult\\" potty-humor animation since those scenes in Flesh Gordon. If you believe that even more time should have passed since then, skip Team America. If you're willing to sink to its level, though, it can be a lot of fun.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Matt Stone and Trey Parker know how to make me laugh: gross humor and clever satire.The movie opens up in France with a hilarious scene where we are introduced to the team but tragically one of them dies.We see Spotsworth go to see the newest Broadway release \\"Lease\\" where we meet Gary,an actor with a dark past.The film starts kicking into it's central plot.It is so fun watching puppets blow up things,fight,walk, and even have sex.The team is trying to defeat Kim Jong Il a lonely but evil man.This is a film that doesn\\"t leave you bored. <br />            <br />   One of the real positive things about the movie is the songs.They are so funny ranging from the team america theme song to a song about Pearl Harbor,the movie.You will proably have to watch the movie twice to catch all the jokes in the songs because you'll be laughing to hard to hear them. <br />     <br />   The dvd has some great extras.It shows all the stuff about making the puppets and sets.The only negative of the dvd is no drunken commentary by Trey and Matt.I reccomend this dvd completely,but don't bring the kids. <br /> <br />
B0007TKNII|4.0|I've never been a huge fan of movie musicals, so I didn't expect too much from \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" But, to my surprise, it was actually quite good! The awesome sets, haunting cinematography, fantastic visual effects, and great performances help to elevate it above the sometimes-mediocre songs. Gerard Butler (\\"Dracula 2000\\") made a great Phantom, and Patrick Wilson (\\"The Alamo\\") was good as Raoule, but Emmy Rossum (\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\") gave the film's best performance! She's talented, beautiful, and can sing too! The supporting cast does a good job as well.<br /><br />I recommend the film to all fans of musicals!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|(by the way this review like all the others under this name are by her son)this has to be the greatest album System has ever released and the others id give about three million stars to this whole cd is great and really flows from one song to the next you can barely tell when the track changes alot of the stuff is WAY heavier but alot more melodic you could probably listen to this about 5 times a day for two years and it wouldnt get old.........I CANT WAIT TILL HYPNOTIZE COMES OUT NEXT FALL. If youre a System fan or want to sample these guys this is them at their best so run out and buy it or ill gouge your eyes out :)
B000002H97|1.0|This album sucks..This album is responsible for the downfall of the band which took them 13yrs into a non-metal world. I can't believe all the positive reviews I read on for this album. Enter Sandman is the worst song I have ever heard..Take my hand..never never land??? GIVE ME A BREAK...If you are new to the band, start out with Ride the Lightning. Pass over this piece of crap
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I find that this album is very soulful and soothing.  Some of the tunes make you feel as if you are in a paradise...it is an easy listen.  Perhaps the thing I found to be this album's greatest achievement was the recording quality.  This is as good as I've heard as far as perfect, dynamic music goes.  Knopfler's voice and guitar work sounds so lifelike, like he's playing in the room with you.  Its hard not to appreciate music like that.  Favorite tracks are : Own Shangri La, Everybody Pays, and of course Boom Like That.  there are really no tracks that I dislike, but some are not as interesting.  Knopfler shows frequent songwriting brilliance despite his more reserved guitar style.  Nevertheless, it all just comes together in an album that is worth owning if you like ANY of his prior work including that of the Dire Straits.  Get it.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This band is far more Zeppelin than Radiohead. Apart from Matt Bellamy's voice, their first album Showbiz is the only real comparison to Radiohead . Since then(1999) this band has evolved hugely with a bigger and better sound as a three piece into more than radiohead could ever hope for. <br /> <br />If you missed the second Album Origin of Symmetry(2001) as it wasn't released in the States i would advise this as a start point for this band. This is the \\"missing link\\" between showbiz and absolution, it shows an era of musical experimentation and learning in a band that i don't think could be matched by any other of today's big rock acts. <br /> <br />The album Absolution starts off with the sound of nazi-esque marching going straight into Acocalypse Please, the name alone says enough, this album will break your heart in two with it's sheer power. <br /> <br />From the thundering bass riff that carries Hysteria, and the incresible guitar shredding of Stockholm Syndrome to the melancholic drama that is Sing for absolution, Muse have created a masterpiece that is right at the forefront of Intelligent Rock  <br /> <br />If all bands were this good i'd die a lot happier
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|After reading the book I wanted to see the movie adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath. The 1940's version, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, is a good film in its own right, but does not bring full justice to the novel. A no doubt cautious screenplay was written to appeal to the conservative audience. The movie seemed to jump around a lot, and does not show the spirit in which the novel was written. The outset of the movie sees Tom Joad walking to his parent's house after he is recently released from prison. He quickly runs into Casey, who is a former preacher wondering around the desolate town. The two quickly learn of the troubles the families of Oklahoma have experienced since Tom was sent to prison. The families have been kicked off their farms with no where else to go. Such begins the adventure to California. Comparing the novel to the movie is quite a task. The novel takes hours to finish reading, and by the end you truly feel that you are incorporated into the Joad's hardship. It drains you emotionally, and you feel sorry for the individuals who had to live through these hard times. This is what I mean by the movie not doing justice to the novel. A two-hour flick does not bring this same feeling. It shortens many of the adventures within the novel. Also, you may feel that important events were left out. However, this movie was released in 1940 and I have to take into consideration the time period, because many of the events that happened in the novel were controversial and would not have made it to the big screen without a big fuss. I suggest if you are going to watch the movie, read the book before hand. The novel is an amazing piece of literature, and the movie does not do it justice.
B0007WPJBQ|5.0|Like many others, I was rather confused and suprised at how many different companies were putting out a dvd of this film. I was at Wal-Mart the other day and noticed a bunch of dvd's at the checkout in slim-pack cases for only a dollar each. I saw that this film was amongst many other titles and so i decided to take a chance and buy it. I was very suprised to find that this dvd of the film (put out by DIGIVIEW PRODUCTIONS) has clear and bright audio and video AND it's in widescreen. Until a major studio decides to put out this film on DVD (and hopefully in a restored director's cut), this version will do fine. It wouldn't suprise me if a major studio release comes before the end of 2006. I see where \\"The High And The Mighty\\" and \\"Island In The Sky\\" will be released in August, so i know video miracles can still happen. Buy this and enjoy it.
B000002J0B|4.0|Oh, this album is just so good...  It doesn't rock out as hard as earlier Zep does, and the band uses a blues sound much less than on earlier albums.  Yet the sound on this album is so magical that, frankly, I don't care.  The Song Remains the Same and the Rain Song are irreplaceable examples of the magic Jimmy Page was working, and both rank among my favorite handful of Zep songs.  A great deal of the album seems like the band playing around to see how much experimentation they can get away with.  They pull it off fantastically with the Ocean, which rocks out despite a missing beat.  And they pull it off with the not-quite-exactly-the-rhythm-and-chords-you-expected Over the Hills and Far Away.  The Crunge is slightly too jerky to rock out thoroughly, but still enjoyable, especially for the ending.  D'Yer Mak'er shows that Zep can hack reggae, but I don't think it adds a great deal to the album.  The other songs, Dancing Days and No Quarter, are less of a departure and both solid songs but not among the classics of Zep.  I recommend HOTH to pretty much any Zep fan, but fans who appreciate Zep for the soundscapes they create will particularly love this album.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Greatest movie ever made.... <br />Man...tons of people upset about buying another Jaws... <br />from the 25th to the 30 anniversary... <br /> <br />Its only 16 dollars if you purchase on Amazon... <br />Get over it ya cheap bastards...and buy the best movie ever,,, <br />later
B00008CLOA|3.0|So here I go. This album has been overplayed in my opinion. Most of the songs I'm tired of hearing except for one. That song is \\"Us And Them\\". I don't think I'll ever get tired of hearing that song. I remember the first time I heard the song; it was Memorial Day weekend, 1981. I was 13 at the time, and was out riding my bike it was Saturday night, and I heard this song, and I was aroused. I wanted to ride home, and ask my parents if I could ride down to the fish hatcheries by the Deleware River; there was this girl who was 14 at the time, and I wanted to go walking by the river with her. However, my father had to work from Midnight to 8:00 in the morning, and this was 10:00 at night, and about 4 miles away from my house, and so there was no way my parents would let me go. I've held onto this for 24 years, and I want to finally release this. \\"Pat if you're out there I want you to know that I really liked you back then. I know I showed the opposite, and I really am sorry, and regret not having told you back then.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />danrh@cfl.rr.com
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|there are very few televison shows that are quality. and the oc is one of those quality shows that come every so often. This show has it all drama, suspense, romance, everything you could ever want in a tv show. i think mischa barton is an amazing actress. when she was about to get raped by trey and she was fighting him off i thought her acting was so amazing and her facial expressions were so perfect, and then when she shot him, it seemed really real. the dvd is worth buying, no question about it.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Wow, is this not only the worst 'Star Wars' film ever made, this could be one of the worst films ever made.  This is a total crapfest:  every character is annoying(especially the brat playing Anakin), the dialogue is laughable, the plot is pointless...pretty much everything about this film is completely ridiculous.<br /><br />George Lucas should be ashamed.  He has soiled the 'Star Wars' name with this piece of garbage.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I've been listening to SOAD since Toxicity and own thier self titled album,Steal this album!,Toxicity and I've been waiting to hear Mezmerize since I heard about it,and when I heard Cigaro I was a little disapointed but they brought me back to waiting for the cd by releaseing\\"B.Y.O.B\\" and I bought the cd on the day it came out and I am still listening to it it dosent leave my cd player,Stereo,computer or DVD player! I think the album is Hilarious and Serious at the same time like\\"Question!\\"is an example of a serious song and\\"Violent Pornography\\"is an example of a Hilarious/serious song and I cry when i listen to\\"Lost in Hollywood\\"and I cant wait till part 2\\"Hypnotize\\"!
B0007Y08IS|4.0|'Team America' is truly one of the funniest movies released in the past few years.  It mocks Bruckheimer-style action flicks, satirizes the current US political situation, and lampoons Hollywood.  Its funny.  Its brilliant.  Its crude.  And its all done with marionettes.<br /><br />The film itself it beautifully shot, with gorgeous set pieces, amazingly creepy puppets, great editing, a fabulous script, and some of the funniest, most toe-tapping, and flat-out wrong songs ever written.  Who could've guessed a puppet action movie could be so well done?  Leave to the 'South Park' guys to pull it off in spades.<br /><br />This unrated DVD has the infamous puppet sex scene in its full glory, which alone is worth the price of admission.  But the other real treat here is the tons of extras, namely the numerous featurettes.  Usually featurettes totally suck, but here they are well produced, informative, and any time Parker or Stone are on screen they're funny.  But these extras really show how much time, effort, and dedication went into making this silly little puppet movie.<br /><br />Parker and Stone are criminally overlooked satirists.  All their detractors concentrate on is their overt crudeness, but lying just below the surface, in just about everything they do, is a serious message about how screwed up our world is.  They do a fabulous job, albeit with tons of poop jokes and curse words, satirizing everything from foreign policy to silly celebrities.<br /><br />'South Park' is a great television show and 'Team America' is just as good, if not a bit better.  Let's just hope there will be a sequel.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I bought this cd when it came out because I loved the song American Idiot. I haven't really listened to the whole thing until a couple of days ago and it's amazing. I saw them live a couple weeks ago - if you have a chance make sure you hear them live. American Idiot is an ok song - not my favorite now that I've listened to the cd. Jesus of Suburbia is one of my favorite songs - lyrics actually mean something.. guess I'm so used to hearing crappy music that this song surprised me. Holiday, Blvd of Broken Dreams (ok.. so I used to really really like this song until pop radio got a hold of it) are other standout songs. Extraordinary Girl is a recent obsession of mine - I can't stop listening to it. Wake Me Up When September Ends is an awesome song too. Homecoming: The Death of St. Jimmy/East 12th St./Nobody Likes You/Rock.. now this song is a new favorite song too.. even though its over 9 minutes long you need to listen to it all the way in order to really appreciate the song. There is no weak song on this cd.. nothing I would skip over. This was my first Green Day cd (besides the greatest hits one) so you don't have to be familiar with them to love this cd. If you don't have it.. go get it.. now..
078681859X|5.0|Nathaniel is a young boy when he is apprenticed to a magician for his training in the art of magic. He is very good at his chosen job, and is very advanced for his age. His hate for a young magician of considerable power when he embarasses Nat at a large party forces nat to desperate measures. He steals a magical artifact worth an enormouse sum of money from his enemy's house by the means of a Djin, Bartimaeus, that he has summoned from the other world. Bartimaeus is a high level djin who has an attitude worse than a teenager's!! Nathaniel also learns to hate his master for thinking him a stupid boy and for not recognizing his amazing talents. When Nat finds out about a plan that has been hattched by his enimies to overthrow the prime minister of England, where the book is set, he begins to realize what he has caught himself up in, and to realize that he will have to take a lot of responsibility to fix what he has done. Written from that alternating points of veiw of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus this book is very tense and funny, read it to find out more...<br /><br />I thought that this book was an amazing piece of literature, and that it deserves praise from all who read it. This book kept me on my toes, and I laughed, went quiet, and shouted out loud as the characters made mistakes, and found out huge secrets. I would recommend this book to fans of Eragon, LOTR, Harry Potter, and SUE. It is not tragic like SUE, but i think that Bartimaeus's point of veiw will appeal to the sense of humor of SUE's fans. This book is good for people aged 10-14, but would also be good for younger or older readers (I hate when I love a book that is meant for people older or younger than me, so this book is good for everyone!)
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather series is my all time favorite series. With the ranking of The Godfather Part II, then The Godfather, then The Godfather Part III. These movies are just so deep and have the biggest rewatchability to them. If you haven't seen them yet, then you have to pick them up, if you have seen them, and you don't have them, then you need to pick it up :)
B0001KL5DA|4.0|I purchased through the Amazon.ca website -and took a chance on selecting a vendor with a $10 lower price  -Princess22222 .<BR>I'd never done this before, but I took a chance, and received my new unopened DVD set complete and in good shape - and about 12% less than Amazon's already great price.  I'd do it again.<br />I&quot;m only 3 episodes into the season -but it looks as good as the previous.
B0007TKNII|1.0|To me, this has got to be the most disgusting remake of a musical I have ever seen. I cannot believe that the crew wanted to turn one of Webber's musicals into a travesty like this! I thought it was scary and completely insane the first time I saw it. It was a long time ago. But, the characters were violent and really offensive.  My mother seems to LOVE it, and that is too bad. Becaus it is strictly VERBOTON in my eyes.
0156012197|5.0|I love this book and it's one of my favorites.<br /><br />You can't imagine how a children book like this one has wonderful deep meanings for life. I'm over 20 years old and I wish I could read this book so many years before to see how I would understand it at an early age, I know it will be so different but interesting at the same time.<br /><br />I'm in my friend's debit for referring me to this book.
B0009HKH6Q|2.0|For some reason there remains a problem with the video quality of  Thomas Crown Affair. What we are suppose to be seeing is a new transfer, ( I guess admitting that the prior version needed improvement) which in fact it did. This new transfer isn't quite what I was expecting, in fact it's uneven or should I say unbalanced which gives a uncomfortable viewing experience. Anyone who purchases this DVD version expecting the ultimate quality version is in for a big let-down. This DVD is offered with the wide screen/ full screen format. MGM appears to be looking in the rear view mirror. With Plasma/LCD quality, why is MGM wasting time with marginal quality standards. This Batch will end up in the bargin bin. Save your money and wait till next time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I suppose there is an art to coming back to mainstream music. And if there's someone who could write a book or teach a class about it, it's Mariah Carey. People had written her off, dismissed her as a Pop-music afterthought, made up wild stories about her losing her voice. Now they're all mad and praying for her demise since she's proved them wrong. They're all eating their words and they might be for awhile. <br /> <br />Let's face it, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is no fluke. And anyone that tells you that is just kidding themselves. Ignore the haters because their mission is driven by pure madness. Skip the one-star reviewers since they have nothing else constructive to do. It's got to make you wonder what could bring on such praise and such hate. Simple answer, this album is headed straight towards 2 million copies sold. <br /> <br />Somehow Mariah ended up having the \\"surprise\\" hit CD of the year. It's no surprise to her fans. But to the skeptics, this has to be a cruel reality check not even they could have imagined. First, she launches her CD in typical Mariah fashion with \\"It's Like That\\" and then follows it up with the current #2 song in the country \\"We Belong Together.\\" Imagine that, after 15 years Mariah is still capable of making the grade. Rumor has it that her next single will be the smooth collaboration with Snoop Dog, \\"Say Somethin'\\" <br /> <br />So if you're still skeptical, let me put your mind at ease. Mariah could teach a Master class on making a musical comeback and still have talent to spare.  <br />
B000002HRE|5.0|This record, to me, represents the best that hard rock has to offer. it is very obvious that this period was an experimental one for metallica. I love the fact they they are ever changing in thier musical style, this shows real musicianship. Real musicians will always try new things and strive to reinvent their own style. Why do you think that metallica have managed to stay in the spot light? If they were still in speed metal, metallica wouldn't have reached the height of popularity that they have achieved. All of you metal heads and fanboys out there need to shut it and go find some other band to listen to if you can't take real music. Load-Reload are two great albums, although I will admit that it isn't metal...oh well :) I also think that the packaging sucked ass...especially the covers of both Load and Reload. I would like to poing out that bass coverage on Load and Reload is the best it's ever been. James Hetfield's vocal performance is also at an all time high in these records. The man's voice is simply meant for this kind of stuff(Load and Reload)
B00005KARK|5.0|At shortly over an hour of runtime, \\"Dumbo\\" will always leave you wanting to watch it again and again. I watched it again yesterday, after close to thirty years without watching it, and the same feelings I had when I first caught a glimpse of it came back intact. The storyline is simple: a baby elefant (Dumbo) gets separated from his mother, and he works his way through obstacles with the help of his mouse-friend (Timothy), to get his mom back.<br /><br />The animation from 1941 couldn't be more basic: simple figures, pastel backgrounds most of the time -nothing fancy. Yet the combination of it all, with some classic music tracks and unforgettable lines, make out of \\"Dumbo\\" a movie for the ages, one that has survived time, and that will continue to appeal to everyone no matter how old, no matter when. In particular, since I first saw it in Spanish when I was a kid, I loved being able to play the Spanish language track, and relive the dialogues the way I remembered them. This 60th Anniversary Edition DVD truly belongs in your collection.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|this album totally blew away my expectaions. i was expecty a low-end album with crappy songs but this cd is none of that. this album is better then Steal This Album but just falls short of Toxicity. my favoate song is ''Violent Pornography''. BYOB is an awesome song too.
B000002HJR|5.0|Listening to this album is like getting smashed in the face with a 20 lb. sledgehammer.  You then get picked up and bodyslammed onto a slab of concrete as metal spikes rain from the sky and pulverize what is left of your body as you convulse from the sheer energy emitted from this amazingly powerful lineup of songs.  If you don't have it or haven't heard it, you are missing out.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers are pretty good, and this is a pretty good CD- the only problem with it is some of the tracks are just fillers. Best songs are Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, and All These Things I've Done. (if you want to just download them instead of buying)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series.... My wife and I watched the entire series in about 4 days. I wanted to add this review to the many other '5 star' reviews to let Fox know how much they messed up. Too bad this show didn't air on a real network! <br /> <br />Jack
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Finally, she's back.  Mariah Carey's return to form is definitely welcomed, especially after horrible albums like Glitter, Rainbow, and Charmbracelet and her equally terrible movie Glitter.  It's a relief when a legendary voice and talent like Diva Mariah Carey gets things going the right way.  To help her on her path she enlisted top songwriter and producer Jermaine Dupri, as well as Babyface, Kayne West, The Neptunes, James Poyser and the Legendary Traxter ( yes THAT guy from the Twista cd's) as well as producing and writing some of the songs herself.  She also gets help from popular rappers such as Snoop Dogg, Twista, and Nelly although they all take a backseat to Mariah's powerful voice.  Mariah turns in arguably her best vocal performance of her career.  Simply beautiful.  The Ballads are sung with incredible passion and skill and the up tempo songs are done excellently.  My favorite songs include the two lead singles It's Like That and We Belong Together, as well as Mine Again, One & Only, Circles, I Wish YOu Knew, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird ( which is the best song on the album).  The songwriting is often top notch and the production is spot on point.  The Vocals, as said before are complete greatness.  Her voice is so unique, angelic powerful, inimitable...whatever adjective you can think of that's good.  Mariah Carey deserves all the recognition she gets because this is surely a great comeback album and classic for all ages.  Congratulations to Mariah Carey for making arguably the best album of the year and arguably the best album of her career.  Masterpiece.
0553573403|5.0|This book was great. Martin doesn't hold anything back. It was refreshing to read a book where almost no one is safe. Danerys chapters were a little slow but get increasingly better as the book goes on but it's doesn't ruin the story as she only makes a small part of the whole. This book and the Series (A Song of Fire and Ice) has been what I have measured every other book I have read since against, And most have paled in comparison.
B00008EY65|4.0|I had never even heard of Hellboy before the movie arrived, and I instantly wondered just what type of harbinger of doom and destruction could anyone be with the word \\"boy\\" in their name. Even the paltry Babel Fish of Hitchhikers fame would merely die choking on its own laughter.....or so I thought. I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie \\"Hellboy\\" and the overall story that it followed.<br /><br />The main character is a demon, called \\"Hellboy\\" (Ron Perlman) funnily enough, who comes through a portal opened by Rasputin, (Karl Roden), at the behest of the desperate Nazis in 1944. After the portal is closed with the help of Professor Broom, (later played by John Hurt), Hellboy is found and becomes the FBI's latest weapon against the \\"things that go bump in the night\\". The bad guys come back in the present day to end the world, and they are Rasputin, his girlfriend Ilsa, (Bridget Hodson) and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, (Ladislav Beran). To add to the mix, Hellboy has a new \\"babysitter\\" in Agent John Myers, (Rupert Evans) and a love interest in Liz Sherman, (Selma Blair).<br /><br />Ron Perlman was basically born to play the role of Hellboy, from the basic structure of his face to the very mannerisms and attitudes that Hellboy exudes. Perlman was absolutely stunning in this role, and had the right, sardonic wit to pull it off with class and panache. Even with a huge amount of prosthetic make-up, Perlman was not limited in his expressiveness during the movie. The action scenes were also excellent, and the make-up did not seem to inhibit Perlman's movements at all.<br /><br />Karl Roden brings an intense and deeply emotional Rasputin to the movie, and particularly in the last scenes brings through an intense amount of feeling. However, I would not say that the eerie sense of evilness really came from him. That was really provided by the near-silent Karl Ruprecht Kroenen and his deadly blades. Kroenen is very much the silent type, and mostly communicates through gestures, if at all. The masks that he wears through the movie also add to the inhuman quality of the character, as well as a very quiet, but noticable hissing as he breathes.<br /><br />For the special effects and the set designs, I can only add to the positive comments for this movie. The dark feel of the movie was excellent and added to the sense of forboding that was brought by some characters. Also, the achievements of the effects team were really stunning, and what they managed to do with various everyday items has been great. Also, the robotics and so on have been excellently executed and have only added to the movie's overall feel and atmosphere.<br /><br />The 2-disc set provides some interesting information on both the making of the film and various characters as well. I found them to be very informative and well set out. If you do not want to wade through stuff that is not interesting to you, you can go straight to that section, rather than watch the entire \\"Making Off...\\" thing.<br /><br />For action and a good story that combines history, fantasy, Hell, magic, and some very interesting characters, \\"Hellboy\\" is pretty hard to pass up. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it, including the Samaritan, which \\"uses really big bullets.\\"tures, if at all.

B00002Z88D|5.0|Another great CD, if your a Metallica fan you need this in your collection, great great CD
B000002WPI|5.0|this album blew me away. it's for sure one of my favorite hip hop albums of all time, and i have over 250. it has lasting listening ability, you'll be bumpin it for years to come. dont sleep, get this if you havent yet.
B000056HE9|5.0|This should be required viewing at Christmas time.  This is a simple story of setting priorities and remembering what Christmas is really all about. <br /> <br />The casting is perfection.  This is Cary Grant at his best.  Loretta Young, David Niven and Monte Wolley round out the fine cast. <br /> <br />There are many fine scenes including the snowball scene, skating scene and the christmas tree decorating scene.  But the most important scene is the final sermon.  That tells us all what Christmas should be about.
B0002858YS|1.0|Their songs are 1 chord. The vocals are 1 note. They want to be Interpol but just suck too much. Mildly catchy enough to appeal to the pop-headed masses, obviously selling many albums and enjoying success. Too bad their success is not proportional to their talent. Try Interpol instead.
B00000163G|5.0|one of 2pac's last cd. 2pac is one the greatest rapper ever. There are hit tracks like Can't C me, Got my mind made up,Ambitionz az a ridah,No more pain, and all eyes of me. 2pac's last album gets 5 out of 5. Rest in pain 2pac.
B00005Y228|5.0|If \\"Light Years\\" was the re-introduction after \\"Kylie Minogue\\" and \\"Impossible Princess\\" took Ms. Minogue from pop queen to chart reject (no matter how admirable her attempts at artistry were), then \\"Fever\\" is unquestionably the explosion. The moment that \\"Love At First Sight\\" or \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" come blaring out of the speakers, Kylie's full-blown transformation becomes crystal clear. \\"Fever\\" may be more slick and less camp than \\"Light Years\\", but the energy and fun is still alive and kicking. \\"Love At First Sight\\" is exhilirating Madonna-meets-Modjo pop, while \\"Love Affair\\" blares with electric guitars and \\"In Your Eyes\\" thumps with a reserved house groove. The knock-out here is, obviously, \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\". This genius slice of post-disco, Moroder/Daft Punk-esque electro-pop is deserving of the global success it recieved from late 2001 to spring 2002- when it managed to swoon American audiences and became Kylie's first Top 10 hit there since 1988. The robotic beat and bassline melt with Kylie's sensual, breathy delivery. And anyone who doesn't get the \\"la la la\\" refrain stuck in their brain are either deaf or dead. For a 2002 pop album, \\"Fever\\" takes drastic sidelines in rooting its influence with disco and '80s pop rather than urban-inspired club music like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera have attempted. Not only that, but Kylie- who is already in her '30s compared to most of these 18-21 year-olds running around the pop charts- is confident and not afraid to have a little fun. Well done, lass. Well done.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Phantom of the Opera is one of the most popular if not THE most popular musicals of all time. I saw it live on Broadway recently (With Hugh Panaro) and adored it. I fell in love with the movie as soon as I saw it as well. Fantastic! Great cast, especially Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson whose baritone/tenor voices sound so emotional it makes me cry every time. Lovely sets, great music and stunning direction. 5 stars easily. Add another 100 stars for the bonus-material!
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Team America is a riot.  An over-the-top send-up of action films and politics it almost always hits its gag target for a good laugh.<br /><br />The puppet work is excellent and very expressive and the characters are voiced so well that at times you forget that you are watching marionettes.<br /><br />The sex scene is absolutely histerical as is the finale in South Korea.  Highly recommended if you have a twisted sense of humor and a strong stomach.
B0000028VT|5.0|Music Box showcases the voice of our times. People only wish they could \\"supposedly overdue\\" an album..Mariah can take her voice where she wants, and she does. Sappy, yes, great album, yes.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|This movie clearly is a big piece of fluff, but it has some warm, fun moments that make it much more palatable than I would have expected.<br /><br />Gere is charming here.  It's nice to see him smile in movies these days. Sarandon, as is often the case, rises above the flimsy material.  Anita Gillete (I know!) is kind of a hoot and Tucci contiues to be a scene stealer.  Oh yeah, JLo is in it too.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah voice alone puts her way ahead of the pack, trust me when I tell you the one star review are bogus. I am so sick of people saying \\"if you liked the old Mariah you won't like this.\\" Hello, she's not 20 anymore, but what she is doing is putting out the hottest music of the year 15 years into an already stellar career..\\"We Belong Together\\" has exploded to the top of the airplay charts and is #2 on the Hot100. This is because people are buying this album like crazy, not necessarily the digital single. Say Something is a hot song and deserves to be blasted from speakers. Stay The Night, Joyride, and Mine Again are vocally amazing. But basically I could go on and on but the entire album is truly amazing.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|'Faceless' was the album that introduced me to this hard rock alternative band Godsmack. And the album ain't half bad at all. Godsmack shares so much of the sounding of the beats and rhythms to Staind and Korn. Usually in these types of bands you will find one dimensional lyrics but in 'Faceless' the lyrics outdoes the actual music. My favourite songs were 'Faceless', 'I Am', 'I Stand Alone' and 'Serenity'. These songs made the album a hit.<br /><br />This album was my introduction to this great band that has evolved with wisdom in their careers and are sticking with what made them great. This is Godsmack's third release and I am now a proud fan of this great band. Also watch out for the song 'Re-Align' that is some great sound beats.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland.  The movie is absolutely breathtaking.  I love everything about it from the costumes, to the script, from the actors, to the cinematography art direction.  The viewer gets to witness how the story, \\"Peter Pan\\" came to be.  Actor Johnny Depp not just plays the part but transforms into \\"Peter Pan\\" Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie.  Watching this sent chills down my back -- the sign of a spectacular performance.  I was mesmerized while watching Finding Neverland.  I felt as if I leaped from my seat into each scene.  This film gets 5 stars!
B000003TA4|5.0|I started listening to this album last night, a friend gave it to me. Let me tell you, this album is genious. I had no idea what i was missing out the past 14 years. Its one of those cds where all the songs are great.  Im sure you wont find an expert critic who says this album sucks. check out the other reviews and its popularity, you wont be fooled.
B000002VTE|5.0|I cant tell you how long I have been searching for this cd.  I first heard the first track during the movie \\"Vanilla Sky\\". It plays as Sophie is walking in to David's Memorial.  They neglected to include it on the soundtrack, so I didnt know the name of the band or the song, and it took a bit of detective work on my part.  I finally found it, and the first track \\"ladies and gentlemen....\\"  alone is worth it for me.  Anyway, music for me is all about how it makes me feel, and I love how this makes me feel.  I love music that has the abstract feel of a dream, so this does it for me.  For those of you who are interested in another great song that the aforementioned movie also forgot to include, you must also try \\"Njosnavlin\\" by sigur ros (it plays as david jumps)  You can find it in the cd entitled \\"()\\" and it is track #4.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The three greatest movies ever made our now on DVD. Let's stop getting mad at George for what ever changes he decided to make. They're his movies and his decisions deserve to be respected. This is the man who brought us the \\"Holy TRIlogy\\"! Let's just remember the movies for what they are...gold. If George Lucas decided to attempt to make them better, good for him. THe fact remains that this boxed set is the same three movies we know and love. THe only difference is a little tuning of the special effects and a couple of added scenes. Star Wars is a boxed set i will cherish for the rest of my life. The \\"New\\" trilogy is not living up to the originals. However, i have seen the third installment and it overcomes the first two's overall crappiness. The third star wars is fantastic. It is the best of the saga and sets the originals up nicely. Star Wars is something that everyone can cherish, and the DVD boxed set will alow us to do that better. Stop protesting and enjoy the films that made our jaws drop 28 years ago...in a galaxy far far away...
B0007TKH66|5.0|I'm am amazed at the detailing of these series, like the Andorians Antenna's that move & convaye their emotional states. <br />Sorry UPN didn't keep the show on, I think they should take the show to like one of the Pay channel -like ShowTime- <br />the New Remakes of The Outer Limits started on ShowTime first, then later to Independent TV.. The DVD's Are Great!!!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I saw this movie as a child, and I couldn't remember much about this movie when it came out on DVD. I bought it because it was one of the movies I wanted to get, and I watched it as soon as I got it back home. After watching it, I began remembering things about the movie that I hadn't remembered before I bought it. I have to say that this movie is one of my favorite Disney movies, and it will probably always be one of my favorite Disney movies.
B000059H99|5.0|This movie will move you, motivate you, and inspire you. A simple story about a nobody who has a passion for the sport of boxing and gets his chance to make the big time. Realizing the odds he faces, he aspires to give it his all -- win or lose --and come out a winner in his heart. Meanwhile, he also longs to win the girl of his dreams. Stallone was much in the same situation when he wrote this film, no doubt his inspiration. Not only did he go the distance as a result of this film, he became one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. Possibly what made ROCKY such a winner was how audiences could possibly relate to Rocky's hunger and his desire to overcome the odds in his life. Well-made, well-acted, and from the heart. Movie magic, folks...
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is a great movie, and it's one of the best out there. I would have to put this movie in my top 15 movies because it is so good.
B0002S94OS|5.0|After I got this CD I thought it was good but the more I listened to it the more I couldn't stop listening to it. It has not been out of my CD player for more than a day. I tried mixing it up like I usually do but I just couldn't. It's been at least 2 month since I bought it too. Every song on this disk, is AWESOME! Buy it you wont be disappointed. Their other CD's are good too.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Before I bought this movie, I read reviews on many different websites, and I wasn't expecting the movie to be very good after reading the reviews even though many of the reviews have been good. The movie was better than I ever expected it to be after I bought it and watched it for myself.
B00003CXDG|2.0|Tom Cruise is back in MI:2 - this time his targets are IMF renegades who stole the cure to a lethal and unknwon strain of influenza. Once infected, \\"Chimaera\\" disintegrates blood cells over the course of two days. The cure is worthless because nobody has yet contracted the disease which exists only on a few petri dishes inside a lab bristling with high-tech and \\"safely\\" ensonced within a highly-secured office tower in Melbourne. Knowing the target and the likely theives, Tom Cruise must break into the lab and destroy the disease before the thieves get to it. Quickly pegging the rogue agents responsible, Cruise enlists the aid of Nyah (Thandie Newton), a professional thief and former lover of one of the agents. Her job isn't to steal the virus, just \\"coax\\" the agent into locating it. That's the plot....  <br /> <br />Director John Woo tosses out the subtleties that De Palma tried wreaking in the first MI, instead tieing the script along with action sequences that don't get excite as much as annoy. The idea of turncoat IMF spies is intriguing, and the evil Sean Ambrose has some of his own tricks, but Woo doesn't do much with the possibility, directing as with a 9mm. Things explode, or fly, and pretty soon, nobody on screen seems to know what's going on. It's not even a good John Woo movie - with Cruise and Scott failing to connect as Travolta had in \\"Face Off\\" and \\"Broken Arrow\\".  A fun rental, but by the time it's ready for return, your mind has completely disavowed any knowledge of the prior two hours.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid because it came out in theaters when I was a kid and really liked the movie. When I heard that the movie was coming out on DVD I knew that I had to get it. When I heard that there was an extra scene (\\"Morning Report\\") added to the movie, I knew I had an even better reason to get the movie because I wanted to see if it made the movie any better than it already had been. When I saw the extra scene in the movie, I really liked it, and I'm glad that I have the DVD.
044022165X|4.0|Because I was in law school when I read it, I immediately identified with the hero of this Grisham novel. Rudy Baylor, the hero, isn't the top-notch student of some top-tier school, and the mysterious or openly corrupt southern firms aren't about to bang down his door. Even the mid-level prospects that Baylor had counted on for needed employment after graduation seem to vanish in the wind. But he's determined and not just a little ambitious, and his very first case takes him up against an evil HMO represented by the top law firm in state, a self-contained old-boy network with time and money to burn, and half the state's judges in its pocket.  <br /> <br />But Rainmaker is more than that. Actually, it's a bundle of stories sharing Rudy Baylor as the common denominator. He finds love with a battered wife, room and board with a widow who may be worth millions, learns things about law they don't teach you in law school and mixes with a rogue's gallery of unsavory types who are in equal measures scary and indispensable. Baylor's best hope (for work) is the ambulance chasing king of the hill, served by an army of disbarred or never-licensed minions who can't litigate issues.  <br /> <br />The book is best in the first half when it's not clear which of these little stories - if any - will take over the book. When Baylor's lawsuit against the evil HMO's takes over, the story necessarily slows down and becomes less satisfying. The trial itself becomes a bit of a disappointment - the racist old-time judges suddenly keels over to be replaced with one more friendly to Rudy and his cause and openly averse to the defense; the defense attorneys themselves remain the perfect paradigms of their evil breed and the defendants...well, what would you say in the defense of an HMO?  <br /> <br />As if to balance, Grisham beefs up the other plots (now firmly subplots) with unconvincing melodrama - a violent confrontation with the battered wife's evil husband being the worst example. Through it all however, he remains Rudy Baylor, first year law grad, scared out of his mind and possibly the Grisham's best hero.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This is the way hollywood usually works. This time it was the Sam Raimis Spiderman that set out this boom of making movies from the classic comic superheroes. Hulk dives straight to the lowest cast in this series. It`s just so embarassinly ridiculous and same time way too serious for beeing a superhero film. This movie is split into a drama-part and an action-part. Director Ang Lee, who has made before wonderful drama and e way better action than this, isn`t really the one to be blaimed for this pancake. Film that has almost 10 producers and writers holds the name of its director usually only for a the markening. Still the best two superhero movies to date are Tim Burtons Batman and especially Batman -return.
B00028HBKM|2.0|His political philosophy aside, Mel Gibson is a gifted man.  He's done good work in the past.  Braveheart was pretty good but this movie, I'm sorry to say, was way overrated.  I think the content itself is powerful.  It's a harrowing, unforgetable experience.  Others here might disagree with me but I think that extending the scene where Jesus Christ was tortured is unnecessary.  Yes, show how it happened but don't dwell on it so deeply to the point that this becomes the centerpiece of the movie.  As a Catholic, I understand why this was here, I understand the religious context, but objectively speaking I cannot find any other reason to think that this scene warranted so much of the movie's time.  It gives the entire film a sense of being overrated.  Imagine if this had been a movie about some other guy, a regular John Doe being tortured and that a good chunk of the movie centered on his being beaten to a bloody pulp.  The movie would tank and get an average of two stars here on amazon.  If anyone wants to buy this product, it's your choice.  I viewed it once and that was enough for me.  If I were to buy it, that means that I'm willing to watch an extended torture scene of Jesus Christ more than once.  That's just too much for me.  I'm sorry.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This question, for me, refers to Trent's previous major albums: Pretty Hate Machine; The Downward Spiral; and The Fragile.    Now, With Teeth.  The first two or three listens I detested.  I wanted to die.  I was angry at Trent for giving me such a horrible excuse for an album.  But \\"Sunspots\\" stuck out wonderfully, and I couldn't bring myself to break the cd or give it away.    Pretty soon, I fell in love with \\"Right Where it Belongs\\", particularly satisfied with an odd change in voice quality midway, done on purpose of course, and the audience is a nice touch.  Soon after, I got used to the track \\"With Teeth\\" and Trent's \\"odd\\" way of singing the title lyrics (awitha teetha, emphasis on the actual words among syllables).  It became amusing, and then soothing.  Finally, \\"Getting Smaller\\" made me fall deeply, madly in love with the new album.  I have absolutely no complaints about this song in particular.  It is a fun listen and the lyrics are an improvement from The Fragile (which I enjoyed as *my* first NIN album), and that goes for the entire cd, even if he sings some of the lyrics a little oddly.  Come on people, this is Trent Reznor we're talking about.  Not some poppy group that doesn't write its own... anything!      Get used to With Teeth, and learn to love it, is my advice.  When I let my girlfriend borrow it and she said it was her favorite so far, I realized that I share the same opinion, at least for now.  My preference fluctuates.  It depends on my mood.  For a week I will listen to The Fragile.  The next, I'm back to The Downward Spiral, and loving every second of it.  Right now, I am totally With Teeth.    If With Teeth hasn't taken a bite out of your neck and your mind, you probably aren't listening loudly enough.  I thought it was too quiet; then I realized I was just too much of a woose to turn my CD player up as loud as was normal for The Downward Spiral or The Fragile.  When I cranked With Teeth up to high volume, I found it to be just as loud, just as thought provoking, and just as amazing.    Don't let your dentist pull this one until you give it a chance to penetrate your gums.  You'll be happy for another change, and will indeed feel a bit wiser.    With Teeth. Is. A. Masterpiece.    To those who cannot accept change - If you think you can do better, do.  Otherwise, let the artist do his work.  You're not the same person you were six years ago - neither is Trent.  You would have complained if it was anything else, whether it sounded like TDS or TF or... anything.  If it had sounded like My Chemical Romance, someone would have complained.  If it had sounded like Green Day, someone would have complained.  If he had attempted something more hip-hop oriented, lots of people would have complained.  Quit jumping on the bandwagon and just let the new album settle.    You know those artists releasing an album every year?  Yeah, they sound the same and get away with it most of the time.  Here we go with some variety and the reviews plummet?    People need to step out of their comfort zones.  It would appear we've been taken over by the abomination called emo, and can't seem to accept anything else.    Don't you know what you are?
B0007P3582|4.0|When this album first came out, I didn't really care for it outside of a few tracks. But, upon a second listen a few months later due in fact that \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" is becoming the jam of the summer, I discovered this a hot album. The radio singles \\"Candy Shop\\" \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" do exatcly what they are intended to do, be hot club bangers, and they might be the hottest club songs of the year. The street stuff is very good too like \\"This is 50\\", \\"Gunz Come out\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\". These tracks are hard, but not too hard that casual hip hop fans wouldn't listen to them. 50 has made an album in true chameleon fashion, that it pleases virtually every facet of hip hop.
B000002WPI|5.0|With nine talented emcees and one of the most creative producers \\"RZA\\", there is no way you can go wrong with this LP. With killer cuts like \\"C.R.E.A.M\\" and the underground success \\"Protect Ya Neck\\", the Wu-Tang were sure to find success. Wu-Tang Clan is pack of all individual personalities with each having their own unique style, which opened several solo projects between them and with \\"RZA\\" as their secret weapon, Wu-Tang were seemed to be invincable in those days.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I have always been a SOAD fan. I went to see their first tour, and every your after that. When i heard about a new CD, i thought it was going to be good. I was wrong. It is F***ing awesome. This is the best SOAD album. I cannot put this CD down. Here is the overview of the CD. <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side - Intro. I couldnt have thought of a better begining of a cd like this. great forecaster of what is about come. <br /> <br />2. B.O.Y.B This is System all right. This was the Single with the cd. This is one of the best songs on the cd.Very political with its meaning. <br /> <br />3. Revenga. Too much to say about this song. The chorus sound like tango music, and it al flows together with the guitar and the vocals are syncd. Very Very good song <br /> <br />4. Cigaro. This is a very funny song about how \\"size matters.\\" With lyics like \\"My **** is mch bigger than/My **** can waly right throught the door\\" very funny <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video. The reggage side of system of a down. Daron does an awesome job with the vocals in this song  <br /> <br />6. The cocaine makes me feel like im on this song. This is a mental song. this song and VP are really Mental. Good guitar solos <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography. When i first looked at the track, i thought they were Psyco Mental. \\"Everybody, Everybody, Everybody Sucks\\" crazy lyrics, awesome acustic guitar. They Just might be mental <br /> <br />8. Question!. This song reminds me alot of Chop Suey. With hard guitar solos leading into soft lyrics. Flippin sweet <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue. My favorite song on the cd. another political song with lyrics like \\"You and me will all go down in histsory with a sad statue of liberty/and a generation that didnt agree\\" fast pace guitar and lyrics. Good song <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood. another funny song. good use of computer voice. Good keyboards from Serj. Confusing lyics (but arent they all) but it is still a good song <br /> <br />11.Lost In Hollywood. A soft side of system of a down we've havent seen in previous albums. They have a Queen sound to them in this song A kickass way to end a cd. <br /> <br />overall, this was an awsome album, not just for fans of system of a down, but for anybody who like rock music. The only downside of the album was Daron Malakian took over the vocals, and it was way too short (which will be fixed in part 2: Hypnotise which will be released in august) Go buy this album It rocks hard!!! !!!
B00062IDCO|5.0|I would buy every volum of each Star Treck they put out (Voyager, Deep Space 9 etc.) if only for the price tag. <br /> <br />Come on, $100.00 for each season thats been in syndication for how many years?  Totally not fair.  Will buy when prices come down, a lot.  Again I love all of them.  They are all entertaining.  But the price tag, way too heafty.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|One of the best Maiden albums ever. BNW is up there with seventh son and powerslave. Great songs!!!
B00008DDHZ|4.0|Bloody Sunday was the day when finally the world opened their eyes and saw how brutal and disgusting the Brtis really were.I'm not an anti-  british guy but you have to admit they did put us through alot. What annoys me is the fact people can forget that so quickly...and yet 9/11 will be remembered forever..    Im an Irish Catholic myself and this was a day of shame on the irish people and others who are related to Ireland. Til this day the North is War Zone. Sinn Fin are still being looked down upon by the rest even though they are the only people still fighting for the full united Ireland.    The film itself was deadly. Its a sensitive subject which was taken on with brave film making.I really liked the whole home made look to the film it was really effective.    Finaly the world sees the real British Army....not this patriotic Iraqi bullsh*t
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I'm sorry to have done this, but in order to have my review of the 2004 Disney DVD of \\"Return to Oz\\", I have just had to delete my review of the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD - Amazon.com doesn't allow customers to have 2 reviews on a particular item, even if they are entirely different editions.  But as you will see below, I am reviewing both DVDs on this review.  I first saw \\"Return to Oz\\" on TV when I was maybe only 6 months (yeah, I know that sounds weird), and I loved it.  I saw it on video much later when I was in High school but the tape was so old that there was static almost all over the place and many times it slowed down, which 'killed' my VCR, which of course I had to replace soon.  I have of course L. Frank Baum's 'the Marvelous Land of Oz' and 'Ozma of Oz' which were used to make this movie, along with a few improvements, like Dorothy being the 'long-brown-haired-in braids' girl of Denslow's drawing instead of John R. Neil's 'short-blonde-hair', Nicol Williamson's portrayal of the Nome King is much better and more menacing than John's fat illustration, and Ozma was just perfectly beautiful!  John gave her blonde hair in 'Marvelous Land' - shown here in the movie, but changed to dark in 'Ozma'.  I wish Glinda had been in this movie though, as she was in both books.  But I really liked seeing Dorothy's old house, the Yellow Brick Road and the Ruby Slippers returning in this movie.  And the music is just terrific!  Maybe one day I'll get and review the CD Soundtrack.  Although, sometimes I think this movie should've kept the alternate scenes where the Lion and Tin Woodman help Dorothy and Scarecroow, along with maybe the 'Army of Oz', then that way it could've been a little closer to the 'Ozma' book, but anyway it's still good.  (* You'll have to look around 'Google' for the 'Return to Oz Deleted Scenes' *).  Not to mention that despite what happened in the beginning, the Emerald City is perfectly designed as a palace.  As always, everything turns out right in theend before Dorothy returns home, and this movie proved that Oz wasn't a dream by MGM, even though I don't really believe that.  But in 2004 my Dad helped me to order the 1999 Anchor Bay, and even though it was 'out of stock', I still managed to get it in 1 week.  I was so excited as I watched it, listening to the movie, watching the picture in perfection (even if there were a few little scratches, etc. but I didn't mind) and joining Fairuza Balk as Dorothy on her adventure back in Oz, picking up a few surprises that I had forgotten.  The ANCHOR BAY DVD allows you to watch the movie in Wide-Screen and Full-Frame, starts the movie with a 'Fairuza Balk Introduction' (she is grown-up, says Hi to us and comments on us seeing the movie.  The Introduction is included in the Chapter Index of the 24 Scenes).  The Main Menu sets up with a rotating 'OZ' symbol and has Dorothy and her friends around her, while the faces of Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, Ozma, Toto, etc. appear and disappear behind them with the opening music.  I was disappointed how there was no Theatrical Trailer (some site  made me think there was).  The \\"Fairuza Returns to Oz\\" Interview Feature had Fairuza Balk talking about what it was like for her to be in the movie, the Special effects, Director Walter Murch,  Cast, the Parade Scene, her career and about 'Oz' itself (we only see her face as she is talking, no footage from film).  But despite the lack of Special Features, I was happy to have gotten my favourite movie in perfect watching condition.  That DVD has no subtitles.  Later, I wrote  and sent a letter to Disney Studios (along with lots of design sketches) on making a \\"Disney's Return to Oz: 20th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD for 2005, but unfortunately they couldn't because I don't work them.  But I wasn't totally upset though.  Disappointed, but not heartbroken.  This year, in getting ready for the official 20th Anniversary of Disney's Return to Oz on June 21, I had decided that I would order all the books andthe new 2004 DISNEY DVD.  I found this DVD to be an improvement over the previous edition, even if it wasn't the Special Edition all of us were hoping and wishing for, like \\"Mary Poppins\\".  This new DVD not only has the Widescreen Presentation (no Full-frame version), the 'Fairuza Returns to Oz' Interview Featurette and the 'Fairuza Balk Introduction\\" (which you can see when you press 'Play', not included in the Scene Selection), but it also has the Original Theatrical Trailer - which plays us some unheard music and a few alternate takes/different angles of scenes not seen/heard in the movie) with 4 TV Spots, subtitles (great, since some lines are hard to understand/hear.  Unfortunately not included on Anchor Bay) and the ORIGINAL 'Walt Disney Pictures (CASTLE)' Opening (not seen on Anchor Bay).  An earlier review said that the picture was 'full of scratches and dirt'; I disagree - The picture has the same picture quality as on the previous DVD, but because it is in its original Wide-Screen presentaion, it actually looks quite a bit better and clearer.  Just ignore the scratches/dirt.  The Scene Selection has the movie in 12 chapters, though (but it's better than the 6 episodes of 'the Wizard of Oz' (1925) and 'His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz' (1914) DVDs.  It would have been nice if \\"Return to Oz\\" actually had 2 Theatrical Trailers (the other being a bit longer) and for the TV Spots to look like the 'Mary Poppins TV Spots' on the \\"40th Annivesrary Edition\\" DVD, but watching them is pleasant enough.  The menus, although they don't set-up like Anchor Bay, have the lovely ending credits music.  The Main Menu has Dorothy looking at the Emerald City, with a rainbow and the movie title behind the palace.  There is, of course, a 'Set-Up' Menu for the languages and subtitles.  But I don't like how they manipulated the picture for this cover.  The Oz background, though beautiful, has the Emerlad City looking almost exactly like the MGM towers instead of the realistic Disney Palace.  Dorothy's face is unnatural, her dress is incorrectly all pink, and the Tin Woodman has been taken out of another photo and is now inserted into this picture.  One of (if not) the BEST thing about is this movie is that even though Dorothy meets, makes and is helped by new friends (Billian the 'Yellow' Hen, Tik-Tok the Mechaninal Man - Royal Army of Oz in this version, Jack Pumpkinhead and the Gump), Dorothy must rely on herself (and not Good Witches and/or her beloved friends) to save Oz, the Emerald City and her friends from Mombi and the Nome King, who in both Kansas and Oz/beyond the Deadly Desert, try to conquer Oz by making Dorothy forget.  Also, despite combining with 'Ozma', this is possibly the only adaptation where 'Marvelous Land' has enough excitement so that it is not depicted as a little child's performance (no-one knows if the 1910 Selig film still survives, the 1987 Cinar series was faithful but later only half is on English Video/DVD, the 1969 version is absolutely baby-like in appearance and who knows what Shirley Temple's 1960 version is like - although I have yet to see the two 60's versions and find out if there was ever an Anime version).  The only part I hate in the 'Marvelous Land of Oz' book is the Woggle-bug, who slows down the story, gets into useless discussions with the friends and is unimportant to the story, so therefore having Dorothy (somehow) return to Oz is much better, something which never happened in the actual story, although there is a tiny picture of her when Scarecrow and Nick Chopper the Tin Woodman make a reunion.  But  a few weeks before the movie was released, some PBS Stations showed a 60 min Documentary called \\"the Whimsical World of Oz\\" (by Production Associates (UK),) which was both a 'Making of Return to Oz/General Oz' feature, (Colour & B&W).  Starring and narrated by Mason Adams, it had many stars, among them being the Dorothy actresses of Fairuza Balk, Diana Ross, Liza Minnelli, Romola Remus Dunlap, along with Ray Bolger, Jack Haley Jr., Dr. Robert Baum, Ozma Baum Mantele, and many others (you can read about it in \\"the International Wizard of Oz Club\\" and the \\"Inernet Movie Data-Base\\".  I wish it had been released onto Video, then the DVD's could've been much better.  'Return to Oz' is available to buy/rent on DVD in Australia, but unfortunately it is a rip-off: the music has been taken out of the menus along with the title and there are no Special Features.  So I would suggest ordering it from Amazon.com or buying it from Disneyland.  Even if there is no 'Return to Oz' Special Edition DVD, I am happy to have both DVDs in my possession and soon all the books as well - although I wish I had thought to order the CD Soundtrack too.  Happy 20th Anniversary to \\"Disney's Return to Oz\\" on June 21.  You made a great movie Walter Murch, you were an excellent Dorothy, Fairuza Balk.  Emerald City, it was beautiful.
B0000028M7|4.0|This is something that so many people really don't understand, because there are so many people out here who don't even know how to honestly explain the difference between help, and drugs(ignorance).  If you listen carefully, and understand the words on almost every single song that he has ever produced, than you will realize that thoughts speak louder than actions.  Without a truthful perception, every reality is an illusion!!!   <br /> <br />We all have our own damn bad habits, but only a very few are honest enough to confess their own damn guilts!!!  We can all find somebody to relate with, but the reason why we can't really relate with each other, is because we take so many things so damn personal, without realizing what it means to be enlightened!!! <br /> <br />Which is exactly why I can really appreciate the self titled album \\"Alice In Chains\\".  Layne was so right when he said, \\"Your weapon is guilt\\"...  We need to be more understanding, and not so damn emotionaly disordered!!! <br /> <br />Worse of all we're really supposedly living in, \\"The United Illusions of America, because pathetically enough, In Money We Trust!!!\\"  This is exactly why nihilism is growing so much, because money has become the owner of so many f**k*n minds!  I think sickman is probably the best song on here, but it's better when it doesn't have so much treble, but more bass on it...  <br /> <br />Angry Chair was like the perfect example that basically knew for sure that socialization's future would only get worse!!!  Now only a very few people can honestly understand the truth within that, because most illusional teachers are continuing to deceive the real meanings of education, because shamefully enough, money happens to be that powerful for their f**k*n minds!  <br /> <br />I truly believe that Layne's intentions were good though, and he was just so amazing.  I love his music, but don't even think once about his drug problems, although that was a good example for knowing our righteouslimits...   <br /> <br />Oh well, every single song on here is such a wonderful classic to tuthfully think about, and honestly remember... <br /> <br />I'd like to fly, but my wings have been so denied...  Which is exactly why I'm such a loner, because fears, and nihilism is unfortunately that overrated.  Hopefully Layne's wings weren't denied when he died...
0553573403|5.0|I've read all the GRRM books in this series (Song of Ice and Fire) and am completely hooked into the history (and back-story) of this strange frighteneing world he has created. For some, it's overly graphic, but I think that's what keeps me reading, in addition to the very complex, densely layered storytelling. Sometimes events are so awful you just want to look away, but you can't stop reading. But there is emotional payoff for every horrible thing that happens, people get what they deserve and eventually there is light where there was darkness. I especially love the character of Danaerys and that whole segment where she marries her wild Gengis Khan type chieftan and becomes an impowered tribeswoman, who suckles dragons. Now that was some superb imaginative storytelling!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This is something that doesn't happen to often anymore in Hollywood, something new, something interesting, something great, things like this only happen once in awhile, but it happened with Constantine. <br />First don't listen to the people who are giving this really low scores, two reasons for this. <br />1. They don't like Reeves, they are part of the he sucks no matter what he does, even if it's good crowd, the ones for what ever reason must diss him, well doing so with this film proves their ignorance. <br />2. Religous folks...now I'm christian, yet I found nothing wrong with this movie, is everything based on what we know? No. Does that mean we can't enjoy a very well made movie...something which isn't real to begin with (movies that is). No. <br /> <br />This movie has GREAT acting in it (yes even from Reeves), a great story, very good CGI and special effects...it's just a damn fine movie, a must see. Very original also.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Yeah right.  Global warming causes a modern Ice Age.  Come again?  Oh, well, forget the science.  (After all, this movie does.)  I can never get enough of watching New York City and other urban blights get destroyed and this flick has great special effects.  I loved the shots of the superhurricanes from the space station.  The escaped wolves prowling the streets of The Big Apple were a nice touch too.  Ice Age here we come!<br /><br />I cannot believe how bad the acting and dialog is in this one.  Dennis Quaid is a good actor, but I guess his Yacht payment was due the month he made this film; nothing else explains why he would agree to star in a turkey like this.<br /><br />This is a flimsy, politically correct end of the world flick.  To the limited extent it is worth seeing, watch it for the special effects.  I don't know but that this flick would be a better viewing experience with the sound turned off.  The cheesy dialog is nothing but a distraction anyway.<br /><br />Two stars because I was able to watch it to the end, but just barely.  Just barely.  By the way, the end of this one is so awful as to make one want to gag.  Geez, I am a tree hugger myself, but here the politics are so in-your-face as to defy belief.  Awful, just awful.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Team America: World Police is possibly one of the funniest movie's I've seen in a while. But like \\"Old School\\" it contains amazing highs, and terrible lows. These lows could have easily been avoided if Trey and Matt would have just focused more on what they're good at, making fun of people and original songs.  <br />   I noticed myself wanting to laugh a lot more than I actually did, but when I laughed, I nearly peed my pants. The music in this movie is hilarious, with the soft guitar and an F-Bomb dropped in the middle. \\"I Miss You and Pearl Harbor Sucked\\" is probably the most random song, but one of the funnier ones. While I was watching the special features, Trey and Matt said, \\"If you take a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, and put puppets in it, it'll be a comedy.\\" This is absolutley true, unfortuately, they took a BAD Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The spaces inbetween funny parts feel dull and leave you lost. Still, the highs make up for most of the lows and this movie was funny. Not as good as South Park, but fun all the same. <br />  The basic plot revolves around Team America, which has just lost a team member. Their replacement is an actor who is supposed to pose as a terrorist and get information. This new member causes problems amongst the team.... <br /> <br />  This movie is rated R/UR for: Strong Language, Sexual References, intense puppet violence, and crazy puppet sex.
0790742780|3.0|This is a wierdly powerful film that most of us can relate to, at least a little.  A laid-off aerospace engineer (Michael Douglas) whose life has gone off the tracks ends up in the bad part of Los Angeles.  He decides to walk to his estranged wife's home (his marriage is kaput too, and his wife won't let him see his daughter).  Along the way, he encounters about every specimen of urban blight imaginable, from the chicano gun gang, to the panhandler, to the scumbag neo-nazi, you name it.  He quickly morphs into an out-of-control psychopath who now gives his earlier supressed rage its full venting.  A very effective role by Douglas; one of his better ones.<br /><br />Robert Duvall is the about-to-retire burned-out LAPD cop who figures out more or less what is going on with the string of shootings and killings that Douglas perpetrates.  Duvall is good, as he usually is, but this is DOuglas' film.<br /><br />This is a very dark and unhappy story, but also moving and powerful.  Not for someone looking for an emotional uplift.  By the way, the ending will rock you (no spoiler here).

B000063DIH|3.0|Better than it's predecessor, but still a mediocre effort, FEAR OF THE DARK would be the last Iron Maiden album with Bruce before he left the band and was replaced by Blayze Bayley.  Bruce eventually came back, because his replacement was terrible, but this release still marks the end of an era.  It has some great songs on it such as 'Judas Be My Guide,' 'From Here to Eternity,' and the power ballad, 'Wasting Love.'  We also see some poorly written album fillers, like 'Fear is the Key,' 'Fugitive,' 'Apparition,' and 'Chains of Misery.'  What were they thinking?  Just like the previous album, there is no Adrian Smith and no keyboards.  I would have given this album 4 stars if Smith was on it, instead of Gers.  Janick Gers is the second worst thing to happen to this band (the other being Blayze Bayley) - his solos are sloppy and unoriginal.  We're talking about Iron Maiden here...couldn't they have found a better guitarist?  I'm better than Janick Gers.   <br /> <br />The title track sounds great in concert with the crowd singing and humming along.  Another hidden gem here is 'Childhood's End,' which has a beautiful guitar harmony.  Even though I gave this album three stars, if you're a Maiden fan, you'll still like it.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I read most of the reviews for this System Of A Down CD and am surprised at the increasing number of bad reviews that it's gotten.  I was just shocked at how much better this CD was then I had thought it would be.  It had been awhile since System Of A Down had come out with original material, so I didn't really know what to expect.  I think that this CD is the most original and just all around heavy CD this year.  It's unique and has many high points. <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side - Although it's just an intro, it's very relaxing, and very neat... 9/10 <br /> <br />2. BYOB - Everyone knows this song now.. I think that it's a little overplayed on the radio, but that doesn't mean that the song is bad.  The song is very good, and does an excellent job of transitioning from heavy, punk like chords to bouncy party riffs. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />3. Revenga - The first time I listened to this song, I didn't think too much of it, but after repeated listenings, it grew on me.  The song has some very fast guitar playing by Malakian and very fast singing by Serj.  The lyrics are a little odd, but that's what makes System Of A Down good. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Cigaro - This song was the first I heard off of the CD, and I love it.  It's short, brutal and has some pretty interesting lyrics.  Almost like their old stuff. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video - This song, I think, is the first sign of System Of A Down being differant.  The song starts off with a very nice and heavy chorus, and then just dips into a very slow, smooth verse.  Serj and Daron have some of the best voices.  When they're singing at the same time, doing harmonies and such, it sounds amazing. Not my favorite on the CD, but still good nevertheless  8.5/10 <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On The Song - A very long title, but a very short song.  This song has some very odd lyrics, and some more super fast singing by Serj.  Once again, this song sounds like classic SOAD, where the songs are short, heavy, and catchy.  Probably my least favorite song on the CD, but I still like to listen to it when I feel like headbanging  8/10 <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography - One of the best songs on the CD.  Has some very catchy singing by Serj and Daron.  One thing I noticed about this CD is that the lyrics are extremely repetitive, but the songs are catchy, so that's all that matters. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />8. Question! - My favorite song on the CD.  Starting off with a very cool acoustic intro, and then blasting into the song, only to dive back down into a nice soft verse.  I think this song showcases Serj and Daron's voice the best.  Anyone who says that Serj's voice is whiny and annoying, I don't know what they're talking about.  His voice has much range and is very good. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue - I didn't really think much of the singing on this song, but the chorus where they say \\"We'll all go down in history, with a sad statue of liberty, and a generation that didn't agree\\" is awesome.  9/10 <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood - I think this is an underrated song.  While people are focusing on the more SOAD-like songs, like Cigaro and BYOB, I think this song is something much differant for them, but still, they keep their uniqueness with the whole techno thing and the lyrics (especially the lyrics) 9.5/10 <br /> <br />11. Lost In Hollywood - A very, very differant song compared to the rest of the CD.  Daron basically sings the whole song, with Serj just doing backup.  A very nice song, and appearently, it's to become their next single.  I personally thing it wouldn't make the strongest single, but hey, all the songs on this CD are good, so I'd take anything. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall this CD has the potential to be Album Of The Year.  I haven't seen one CD come out this year that's as catchy and consistent as this one.  People who think that System Of A Down are annoying and getting old, would you rather have them change their entire musical view and sound completely differant, or remain the same and keep making the music that they're good at making?
B00006JDU9|5.0|It has been a loooong time since a sci-fi movie has truly impressed me and the star wars movies, two: Attack of THe Clones and episode 3: Revenge of the Sith are a true revelation to me. As a fan of the Star Wars trilogy of the 70s it answers a lot of the question I've had espically about Darth Vador, he and Yoda were always my favorite characters. (I haven't seen Phantom Menace unfortunately.) <br />  It is beyond question that any Star Wars fan will love the new three prequels. The special effects are just phenominal. You almost can't really tell that most of the settings in the movies are computer generated rather sets that actually have to spend lots and lots of time building by hand. (Just Trying to avoid giving away any of the slightest details about Episode 3 for those who haven't seen it yet.) It will definately be worth what you paid for it!!!
B00005JNQ8|4.0|This movie, for the most part, was very suspenseful.  I found my self squeezing my hands together because I didn't know what was going to happen next.  The only problem was that there were a lot of characters to keep straight.  At the end, it was hard to determine who was doing what for whom and why.  This is not a movie where you can sit down and get everything.  You have to think about it.

B000005Z0G|4.0|Tupac has had great singles on most of his LPs, but \\"Strictly 4 My...\\" was the best consistent LP in terms of themes and production values-- to be sure, there is somewhat of a laundry list of producers here, like on several of his albums-- sonically, Tupac is close to the Bomb Squad here, with screechy sounds and buzzing accompanying the rhythm tracks-- this is not the slower, mellow \\"G-Funk\\" that most West Coast heads are used to, but it's a more universal sound..<br /><br />and his pre-death row albums (No, Tupac was NOT signed to Death Row for his first three LPs) weren't focused on the east-west drama that overwhelmed him in the end..<br /><br />1.

B000000I3O|4.0|I'm writing this review as someone who first started listening to Danzig's solo stuff.  I really, really like Glenn Danzig's early solo albums, the first 4 were completely insanely rocking. <br />Since the latest Danzig album Circle of Snakes is probably going to be his last album, I was hungry for more Danzig so I finally started listening to his older music that he made with The Misfits. <br /> <br />While I really like some of the songs from the Misfits, the problem you could have with this type of music is that since a lot of the riffs and same lyrics are repeated endlessly through the entire song, if you don't like a song, you will absolutely hate it to the point of not wanting to ever hear it again.  But if you like it, it sounds like the best thing you've ever heard, because I'll say one thing for the Misfits songs I've heard so far, they stick with a riff / lyrical structure and go with it, sink or swim.. so you're either gonna love or hate these songs--but more than likely love them a lot, based on what most everone is saying on here. Overall I love 80% of it.  Skulls is one of the most energizing, headbanging song I've heard in a while, and I'm sorry I hadn't given the Misfits more of a listen before.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I remember System commenting on a different (more mature) sound/style that was going to be on this album, and I remember seriously worrying that they were not going to sound as good. On the contrary, they did mature, talent wise, and show every bit of it on this album. The guitars and drums are more incredible than any past System albums, and the dual vocaling, though at times over the top, is great. <br /> <br />1. The intro, Soldier Slide, is everything an intro should be. Simple, straight forward, great. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. BYOB, the first single, and rightfully so. The guitars in this song still blow my mind. Incredble speed and rhythm combined with a catchy note scheme push this song into the realm of greatness. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Revenga's strong point is clearly the vocals. Matched with the guitars and drums, a lightspeed refrain coupled with a catchy chorus make this a strong point on the album 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Cigaro, first track I heard on the album, it still stands as a good track, not one of the best, but decent musically. The vocals leave a bit to be desired. 7/10 <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video is one of the best tracks on the album. The one respect in which I first thought needed work was the vocals, but the excellent musician ship and multiple style changes make up for it and leave it near perfect. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine is a decent track. Like Cigaro, it's one of the weaker points, sounding to average. Simply because they're System I was expecting more, but its a good song nonetheless. 7/10 <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography is the most well-balanced track on the album, combining every aspect of System's incredible talent in the perfect blend of vocals, guitars, and drums. The song opens the second half of the album and leaves nothing to be desired. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Question! is a great track, and its greatest tragedy is that it suffers to follow Violent Pornography. As a System song, it combines the usual cryptic lyrics withskillful music to form an even better song. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue is in my opinion the best track on the album. I couldn't ask for more. The intro guitar is actually similar to that of BYOB, and its still great. The music and the vocals all combine to create this masterpiece; the high point of the album. Greatest song on the album, definitely one of System's best ever. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood was the first track that i noticed a big difference from System's usual routine, the difference being the synth intro and techno voices throughout. Honestly, that didn't lessen the song's value at all, and I would say this is one of the better tracks. A very solid number. 9/10 <br /> <br />11. Lost In Hollywood took me a while to warm up to, like most of System's slower songs. The only song on the album that could be considered slow, it's really more of a revisited approach to the entire album with the same skill and musical mastery, just taken at a different tempo. The concluding track is a great finish to the album and couldn't be better. 10/10
B0007CNXUK|4.0|the extrodorinary life of James Matthew Barrie is like a real life fairy tale, who brought out the imagination in children, pretend your pirates on the sea, pretend your Cowboys and Indians. Finding Neverland is the biographical story of playwright and author of the flying boy who didn't grow up, J.M. Barrie and the woman and boys who he put a joyus effect on as they inspired his classic tale of Pirates,Indians,Mermaids and a flying boy. This is a beautiful picture, an imaginative triumph of a man's imagination, it's extrodinary, a magical masterpiece. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are sensational. J.M. Barrie must be a inspiration for Walt Disney, because did an adaptation of \\"Peter Pan\\". One of the best biographical films among \\"the Aviator\\" and \\"Chaplin\\"If you want a great biographical film, See \\"Finding Neverland\\" because by watching this masterpiece you'll find Neverland. A film that explores one man's imagination and the family who loved him for it
B0002IU988|5.0|Tremonti is flat out talented. Period. There are actual SOLOS on this album. Can you believe that? How rare are they nowadays? Well on this CD, some songs even have more than one. Ha. The new singer is twice the singer Stapp was. Easily. Im looking forward to their future work, because this is just pure rock yall. No doubt. I was starting to forget what it sounded like. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br /> <br />Open Your Eyes <br />Find The Real <br />One Day Remains <br />Metalingus <br />Watch Your Words <br />End Is Here <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|This album is just about as close to perfect as you can get, you can tell it has been influenced by some more, how should i put it, mellow music. However, that is not a bad thing. I have listened to the cd once through already, but its one of those that will take a few weeks to love, so dont rely on your first impression.  <br />I would say my only disappointment is it doesn't have the same mood as their first cd, and seems to be targeted at a larger audience.   <br />Overall though, it is very good.  <br />
B00006AVRK|5.0|There are some very detailed reviews here, so I won't repeat what's on offer and who's who.     Let me just say that P.G. Wodehouse's books are super funny. I have read almost every single one of his scores of novels, short stories and plays, and have not found one bad apple - they are either good, brilliant or extraordinary. And of all his books, those dealing with the immortal Jeeves and his amiably idiotic employer Bertie Wooster are arguably the best.    This TV series has captured the essence of those books. The acting, the direction, the locations, the dresses of the actors, the situations are perfect. It's comedy at its unpretentious best.    Buy it, you will love it.    Here's an addition to this review after watching over 3/4ths of the titles in this set:    I would probably give this set 4.5 out of 5 stars, only for one reason: the many changes to the actors who play the supporting roles to Jeeves and Wooster in the various episodes. (Thank God they did not change Jeeves and Wooster, they are BRILLIANT.) It's a little disconcerting to watch, like and get used to Bingo Little in season 1, only to discover a new actor playing him in season 2. Or the celebrated aunts. Or a few others.    Overall, though, I would reiterate that this is a very funny series worth buying.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|When I picked up Mesmerize I was expecting the same old SOAD I had heard before, but was blown away when I got something completely different. Lots more melody and personality is what I found in the new album not just a 1-2 1-2 beat, the rifts were all over the place. Not to mention Radio/Video is just amazingly harmonized wow SOAD you did good, you did real good.
B00006RINF|5.0|I must admit that being this was my first Lacuna Coil CD, I wasn't that impressed with it when I bought it about a year ago. I gave it just one play and I didn't like it very much. Recently I went on Amazon.com and read all the great reviews and thought that I must have missed something big time. The reviews here are right...thanks guys! I wiped the dust off Comalies and gave it a couple more spins. This disc really grows on you with each listen. I don't think many will be blown away the first time you hear it (I wasn't), but now that I have played it in my car for two weeks straight I absolutely love it. Comalies features great atmospheric songs and a very good female singer with a haunting voice. I can't think of one below average song out of the 13 and that is a feat in itself. This is a very good album and I will be looking forward to the next one.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|There really is no band in the world who sounds like System Of A Down.<br /><br />  The musicianship of the band continues to grow and progress with this album. Daron has a much more apparent presence on this album.. His voice makes an amazing contrast with the lead singer Serj's. Though this does take some time to get used to. Daron's voice is quiet bizarre and very much an acquired taste.<br /><br />The album is only 38 minutes long. Most CD's hold anywhere from 75 to 80 minutes. While it works well with Hypnotize, I can't help but feel like these albums contain \\"filler tracks,\\" which could have been dropped for one single and more solid album. The content of the song is satisfying. The political message of each passionately sung tune is much more clearly written than previous albums.<br /><br />It's definitely worth picking up, the kind of music you'll get addicted to. Though I do think Hypnotize was the better album.<br /><br />Favorite songs:<br />Lost in Hollywood, Soldier Side, Violent Pornography, Revenga, Sad Statue, and Question!
B000002GAF|5.0|know one can go wrong with anything gino vannelli, writes he is one of the best and every album/cd that he has made is the best <br />and don't forget his brother joe vannelli, is super great his arrangements are the best and he is a great musician, the both of them.brother to brother is totally a great cd  but if you are like me a long time gino, fan and all of his brothers just buy all of his projects and i know you will be very pleased. I have everything by Gino in my library
1878424319|4.0|This little book offers such simple instructions in a complicated world. The philosophy, many of us know that these and others if followed by all, could make a perfect world. Being aware and focusing on such suggestions have kept my soul and spirt calmed more since the reading. It was a little preachy and slow in some spots, but a very good read.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I'm knocking off two stars because it's half an album.  The first song's just a quick intro and \\"Old School Hollywood\\" repeats the same four lines over and over.  I bought it on sale, but still feel like I was ripped off.<br /><br />On the positive side, the remaining nine songs are each really, really good.  Anyone expecting SOAD to write some ten minute epic with a full orchestra accompaniment just to satisfy some critic's complaint that they need to evolve is going to be sorely disappointed.  Like the albums prior, these songs are delivered hard and fast with wildly erratic shifts in volume and tempo.  Perfect for the A.D.D. set, they'll never be accused of hanging around a riff for too long.  Now go take your Ritalin.<br /><br />Guitarist Daron Malakian has taken over; writing all of the music, most of the lyrics, and taking a more prominent role in the vocals.  Fans who appreciate and prefer Serj Tankian's wobbly and sometimes nonsensical vocal stylings may not like the demotion to background fill-in guy this time around.  In fact, the best parts of every song are when the two combine into a twisted and beautiful harmony thanks to producer-god Rick Rubin, who keeps the band raw but the vocals clear and reigns in the insanity with precision.<br /><br />Lyrics stay true to their political roots as evidenced by their radio single \\"BYOB\\" that mixes the catchy pop riffs of \\"Everybody's going to the party/Have a real good time\\" with the thrash assault of \\"Why don't presidents fight the war?/Why do they always send the poor?\\" In addition, the absurd \\"Cigaro\\" mixes lyrics I can't print with \\"We're the regulators that deregulate/We're the animators that deanimate.\\"  Big Media gets a slap in the songs \\"Radio/Video\\" and \\"Violent Pornography\\".  The former suffers from the same 4-line lyrics as \\"Old School Hollywood\\" but they at least built a song around it.  I predict it'll be the next radio hit.  The latter is more direct, \\"It's a violent pornography/Choking chicks and sodomy/The kinda sh-- you get on your TV.\\"  I know I'll catch a lot of flak for this, but my favorite track is \\"Lost in Hollywood\\"; the final track on the CD and the one most likely to be hated by SOAD fans.  It's slow, melodic, and slightly reminiscent of \\"ATWA\\" on \\"Toxicity.\\"  Malakian's vocals remind me of a circa 1970 David Bowie and the song is so unlike the rest of the CD that I can't help but admire this daring new divergence in their music.<br /><br />The booklet gets you the lyrics, six pages of tortured art, and a quote from Charles Manson.  There are plenty of good songs, a few fantastic songs, and only one bad song on the CD -- it's just too bad you're only getting half a CD.<br /><br />Hope the review helped.and sodomy/The kinda sh-- you get on your TV.\\"  I know I'll catch a lot of flak for this, but my favorite track is \\"Lost in Hollywood\\"; the final track on the CD and the one most likely to be hated by SOAD fans.

B0007TKNII|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and found it overwhelming, loud and difficult to follow, but beautiful to look at.  The music haunted me, and my nearly action-movie-only husband, afterward.  So we bought the DVD and tried again with subtitles ON.  I fell so wholeheartedly in love with this beautiful musical that I have watched it repeatedly.  I turn it on here and there just to get a music fix.  <br /> <br />I think all the actor/singers did a marvelous job.  I particularly like Patrick Wilson as Raoul.  He has prince charming appeal with a rich, warm voice.  Emmy Rossum is perfect.    Gerard Butler is sympathetic, yet frightening.   <br /> <br />The whole show is an extremely over-the-top melodrama, and I love it without any reservation.  I believe it will be among the most loved and watched movies in my collection for all time.
B000929AJQ|1.0|It has been six years since Trent has released a disc, and this it the best he can do?  <br />This may be just as dark as Pretty Hate Machine or The Downward Spiral, but it lacks spirit, it lacks enthusiasm, it lacks...teeth. <br />The best songs on the disc would make really great Garbage tunes, or material for an awesome Smashing Pumpkins reunion, but for NIN it's just boring. <br />Next time when you take six years off Trent, catch up with modern times. My Chemical Romance, Spalding Rockwell and The Used are putting out much better discs, and you can guarantee they aren't going to wait six ####ing years to put out another one. <br />
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|While his contemporaries are playing the oldies circuit and imitating their 25 year-old selves to sparse audiences that are doing the same, Robert Plant is still looking forward and taking chances. Robert is no longer trying to avoid his Zep past, like he was on his first few solo albums, and instead he is now applying his past accomplishments toward the advancement of his new music. The key point about this album is that Robert has once again allied himself with a talented young band, The Strange Sensation this time around, and the youngsters whip up a fascinating mixture of new age, worldbeat, and mature rock that is the perfect compliment to Robert's sublime voice and mystical lyrics. These guys manage to make a completely run-of-the-mill grunge riff sound exotic in \\"Shine It All Around,\\" and deliver more surprises like desert-fried delta blues in \\"Somebody Knocking\\" and New Orleans R&B in \\"Mighty Rearranger.\\" Other intriguing tracks like \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" and \\"Dancing in Heaven\\" really feel like believable modern updates of the folkier passages from the third through fifth Zeppelin records, and even the obligatory techno remix hidden at the end of the album somehow manages to mix Robert's past and future. All guys in their mid-fifties should be this full of wonder and ambition. [~doomsdayer520~]
B0002858YS|3.0|When I first bought this album, I loved it. I still like it, but compared to bands like Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, the Bravery, Radiohead, the Cure etc., the material comes up somewhat short. <br /> <br />This is still a really good album. It sounds a bit like a cross between the Cars and the Cure. The songwriting is simple, not the least bit genius. It is a catchy sounding album with good melodies. Its not strong or overly well-written, but it is still worth checking out. <br /> <br />I still find it refreshing to listen to, among anything else on mainstream radio. I am glad to see the new wave style music come back into favor. I think I liked the Killers before they became so popular, and now they seem to mainstream to me. If you like new wave/ 80's inspired pop, you will like this album a lot. I feel it is still worth purchasing and adding to your music collection. <br /> <br />My favorite songs on this album are Jenny was a Friend of Mine, Mr. Brightside, Smile Like you Mean it, Somebody Told me, and Midnight Show. Jenny was  Friend of Mine and Midnight Show are dark, about the murder of a girlfriend. Somebody Told Me is about sexual ambigiouty. All and in all the songs are melodic and easy to listen too.
B00004SV6S|5.0|Brave New World is not only the greatest metal or maiden album ever, it is the best album ever with noone even coming close. &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;The Mercenary&quot; can change your mood in an instant. A definate Must Have.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Ok can I start of by saying that some of the people leaving comments on this site are completely idiotic and don't have a clue what they are talking about. I actually find it amusing reading some of the comments left by people who think they know \\"everything about music\\" yet don't know how to play a single instrument. One of these comments that really made me laugh was the one that said they couldn't play their instruments, which by the way is completely ridiculous. I've been playing guitar for a while now and I still can't play that solo in \\"I'm Not Okay\\". Another comment said that they are in the genre of \\"pop\\". I fell of the ground when I read that one, I was laughing so hard. These guys are nothing like pop. They are a mixture of goth, punk, and rock. Last but not least there was a comment that said Sonic Youth and Fall Out Boy were better then My Chemical Romance. Geez people, Fall Out Boy is for seamsters..get a clue, and how old is Sonic Youth anyways I mean common don't you think they might just need to hang it up already.    This CD is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to. My Chemical Romance has become my absolute favorite band of all time. The way they mix goth, punk, and rock together is truly amazing. And the end result of all these genres being mixed together = the most amazing CD you will ever hear. Unlike other bands, My Chemical Romance actually writes their own lyrics, they don't hire people to write it for them like other bands. And their image is the coolest thing ever, they are true to their image and really don't care if other people don't like it. And just because My Chemical Romance was on MTV doesn't mean anything. Its called \\"advertising\\" idiots. And just because other people unlike yourselves like My Chemical Romance doesn't mean you have to throw a hissy fit over it. I mean geez, how old are you?    Along with that, they are the most amazing band ever live. I have seen them 4 times in concert and personally they never let me down.Their concerts are powerful, loud, and incredibly fun. And when the show is over you'll be begging for more.    So if you don't have it go out and buy it. I promise within the first couple of minutes you'll be hooked. Believe me, I have had it since it came out, and I haven't put it down since. And if you like this CD, then go get their cover of Under Pressure w/The Used.    Favorite Tracks: To The End, Give 'Em Hell Kid, Thank You for the Venom, You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, I Never Told You What I Do For A Living
B0006GQMC8|2.0|Loosely based on the real-life story of Albert Johnson, the `Mad Trapper of the Rat River,' DEATH HUNT (1981) isn't much more than a cynical ploy by Hollywood to drastically rewrite history and milk Charles Bronson's successful Death Wish movie, aided by employing a couple of bankable, if somewhat antiquated, action stars. The real Johnson shot and killed an RCMP officer.  The movie Johnson (Charles Bronson) is provoked by a group of degenerate rowdies after rescuing a dog, owned by a head rowdy, that is cruelly being forced to fight another dog in an unconvincing dog fight (saw the muzzles on the small screen, even without having to rewind or freeze frame.)  The rowdies attack and Albert Johnson pops a couple of them, in self defense, of course, which has them running to Sgt. Edgar Millen (Lee Marvin), a bit of a degenerate himself (hey, life was tough up in the Great North in the 1930s - the law of tooth and claw and all that.)  Reluctantly, Millen initiates a manhunt to track Johnson down and bring him to justice.<br />  What ensues in an unremarkable hour or so of mukluk and snowshoe clad geriatric movie stars chasing each other through the deep snow and tall pines.  The filmmakers may have been buried some anti-authoritarian message in there, but the movie was so flat and the characters so uninteresting - even the usually reliable Marvin seems a bit distracted - that I couldn't muster the curiosity to go looking for it. If you want to see Marvin and Bronson together in a good movie watch THE DIRTY DOZEN instead.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I have watched this DVD many times.  People who wish to put on all-star concerts should study the Concert For George, because it was done right. <br />All the performances ranged from very good to genius.
B00080Z53O|5.0|With his outsize facial features and unremitting soulfulness, Javier Bardem is a supremely adroit actor, who reminds me quite a bit of a mid-century Anthony Quinn in that they share chameleonic abilities and earthy charisma. As he proved with his stunning portrayal of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in 2001's \\"Before Night Falls\\", Bardem can bring resonance to a real-life character and imbue him with a palpable humanistic spirit. In this film, he plays quadriplegic Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, who traveled the world in his youth as a seaman and then suffered a tragic dive off a cliff which left him paralyzed. For thirty years, Sampedro's brother and sister-in-law took care of him on their farm in Galicia, and his one unresolved wish is to die with dignity rather than face another day not being able to move anything more than his head. The controversial issue of euthanasia has been addressed numerous times, most recently in Clint Eastwood's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". It continues to be a hot topic stateside, but perhaps because of its Spanish perspective, director/writer Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar has fashioned a story that seems less issue-oriented and more about how Sampedro infused those around him with a transformative sense of life's possibility.  There is something quite profound about this subtly observed irony, and Amen&aacute;bar, along with co-writer Mateo Gil, seems intent on challenging us to share Sampedro's single-minded perspective while empathizing with the increasing grief his loved ones feel for his approaching loss.<br /><br />Bardem is a wonder as usual, as he convincingly portrays a man in his mid-fifties who can only show his emotions from the neck up, especially through his large expressive eyes, yet you get a charged sense of the life-force that fed his curiosity about the world and his love of the sea. An excellent make-up job by Jo Allen is only part of it, as he gets deep under the skin of Sampedro. Bel&eacute;n Rueda poignantly plays his soul-mate Julia, the beautiful lawyer who is battling her own serious illness while helping Sampedro prepare his case to challenge the anti-euthanasia laws. She is hired because he believes she will be especially sympathetic to his cause, which proves true to a degree that makes her seriously examine her own fate. There is a lovely fantasy scene when Sampedro gets to his feet, and then the camera takes his perspective of running toward the window and flying out the window across the countryside to meet Julia on the beach where they passionately embrace. This is all done to the accompaniment of Puccini's ''Nessun dorma\\", and Amen&aacute;bar miraculously bypasses contrivance to achieve something transcendent. As Rosa, the young single mother who becomes infatuated with Sampedro when she sees him on TV, Lola Due&ntilde;as (the nurse from Almod&oacute;var's \\"Talk to Her\\") provides an effective common-folk counterpoint to Julia, and the story has us wonder which woman will eventually help Sampedro with the final deed. They are almost yin and yang to Sampedro - Julia is cool and glamorous, while Rosa is talkative and needy. His immediate family is equally torn about Sampedro's decision, and Mabel Rivera stands out as Sampedro's selfless, attentive sister-in-law. Clara Segura also shines as Gen&eacute;, a pro-choice activist who dances the precipitous line between personal and professional with alternate strokes of alacrity and regret.  Credit also needs to go to cinematographer Javier Aguierresarobe, who seems to bathe the movie in subtle lights and colors to match the varying moods of each scene.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD include a Spanish-language commentary track by Amen&aacute;bar, which unfortunately has not been translated into English. I suppose it's a marketing reality that the DVD cover (movie poster), as well as the main menu and movie trailer included in the package, all highlight the youthful Bardem from the brief flashback scenes of his pre-accident existence. Regardless, there are three valuable deleted scenes of which I think one, \\"Julia Changes Her Mind\\", should have been reinstated to better understand her character's ambiguity toward the end of the film. There is a comprehensive making-of documentary which I found fascinating, in particular, for Bardem's intensive preparation for the role and the touching video footage of the real Sampedro. Amen&aacute;bar has made a deeply provocative film provided light and gravitas by a searing Bardem. Strongly recommended.es Her Mind\\", should have been reinstated to better understand her character's ambiguity toward the end of the film.

B000088E6D|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS CD!  Michael Buble' has the richest, smoothest voice that I have ever heard.  The selections on this CD are timeless classics that he makes his own.  I especially love \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", it gives me chills. Its so rare to buy a CD where I actually love all of the songs, the whole CD is wonderful! I have been listening to it nonstop for weeks, had to get a copy for my CD player at work too.  You can't go wrong with Mr. Buble'!!
B000000WA4|5.0|This is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins CD. It has variety, from hard rock to quiet ballad. If your listen through the CD from beginning to end it feels like you have taken a long journey. Each song makes you feel different in its own unique way. This epic 28 song double CD conatains fo filler, just great rock. It is a lot different than Siamese Dream, it is a lot more creative. Like the Beatles \\"White Album\\", it is a mixture of many genres of music. The only song I dont really like is \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\". But 27 out of 28 songs are amazing. Overall this CD will be and has been one of my favorite CD's.
0385513755|5.0|This is a wonderful adventure that is often misunderstood as pure fact.  It is a page turner and very difficult to put down.  The illustrations are incredibly helpful if you aren't too sure what they are referring to like myself.  They are also beautiful.  The book itself is quite large so if you enjoy bringing books with you on your travels, this one is quite difficult to lug around.  The chapters are very short which makes for an easy read for just about anyone.  I love a book that can take one meaning and flip it around to have another meaning that comes out of nowhere.  Some of these things may be from the research Dan Brown had done, but many are just from good writing.  A thrill to read, highly recommended.
0380018179|5.0|I first read this book years ago, when it first came out.  I loved it then and still do.  It picks you up and carries you along through the years with Meg and you become one with her.

B000002U82|5.0|Few rock albums approach the perfection of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", the celebrated 1973 release from a group who have been called \\"the most humanist band in the world\\".    The human heartbeat that begins and ends the album can be heard at varying volumes throughout the record, like the one that runs largely unnoticed in the background of our lives.  As the sampled voices (one of the album's many innovations) fade, the second line of the first song challenges us and draws us in to what follows: \\"Don't be afraid to care\\".    If you haven't heard this album before, you are in for a treat.  Like the best Hitchcock movies it has become part of the culture of our time, a modern classic, and has been studied by many people.  Here are a few points that might enhance your enjoyment:    . The album was the first of three inspired by the breakdown of Pink Floyd's original frontman, Syd Barrett.  After years of experimentation with drugs Barrett was admitted to mental hospital in the early 1970s.  Since returning to the community he has concentrated on art and lives near his mother in Cambridge.  He turns up unexpectedly from time to time, as he did at the recording of Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" (also about him), and at the premiere of the Cambridge University stage version of \\"The Wall\\" (also largely about him).    . The voices were recorded by Roger Waters, who asked people a series of questions, including \\"When was the last time you hit someone?\\"    . \\"Money\\" is written in 7/8 time, which produces a disquieting effect.  The crudity of the lyrics is deliberate.  The melody may have been inspired by \\"Hey Big Spender\\".    . \\"Us and Them\\" was originally written for a war scene in the film \\"Zabriskie Point\\".  The director, however, didn't like its slow-motion gentleness, and legal issues prevented its release for several years.    . The session singer Claire Torry deserves a credit for her improvised part in \\"Great Gig In The Sky\\".  Watch for a key change that makes the temperature drop.    . In a break in \\"Brain Damage\\", there is a voice electronically altered to sound as if it comes from the inside of the listener's head (\\"I can't think of anything to say\\").  Is it me, or does it sound a little like Syd Barrett?

B000007MVD|4.0|Unlike many of the reviewers here, I hear these broadcasts live - I may not have heard them all, but certainly a good number. Sometimes I would hear them at our home near Leeds, but many weekends were spent in Fylingthorpe, near Whitby in Yorkshire, and the radio was kept in the corner of the sitting room. If my memory serves me correctly some of the programmes were broadcast on Saturdays about 4 pm, and I would make sure that I was home to listen to them, and if that meant cutting short my walk with the dog along Middlewood Lane, so be it . I was fourteen years old at the time and I would plonk myself down, and be taken out of myself, an otherwise quiet and introspective boy. I certainly had heard Elvis Presley, and other rock stars by hiding the radio and listening to Luxembourg. But none of that music really caught my attention, until the Beatles came along. The music was as just so exciting and exhilarating. There was something here that really captured my imagination, and unlike some others, I really enjoyed the Beatles music more in their earlier days.  I recall trying to tell my parents, they are just so good, don't you think they're the best, the best band in the world, Mum?  My mother, who was brought up all over the world, and lived in Vienna and could sing operetta beautifully, was a bit uncomprehending. Each new Beatles song would be awaited with the most extreme longing, and I was never disappointed - a Hard Day's Night was a musical revolution and a revelation for me. Whilst  later, in my student days, I recognised the new directions of Sergent Peppers, and enjoyed it, it's the earlier albums that still make me want to get up and dance, and twist and shout. Listening to these tracks is to take me back to another age, and a small boy just beginning to try to grow up. I have been trying every since.
B00005KFUM|4.0|Terrifying and loveless music.  This album's baroque drive and brilliant use of classical forms bring a theatrical excess to its despair.  All the cruelty and luxury of the eighteenth century are here.  The castrato \\"Micro Cuts\\" is excoriating - one can almost see the Marquis de Sade watching from the gallery.  Debates about \\"Radiohead\\" or \\"not Radiohead\\" are missing the point.  This is \\"progressive rock\\" in the very best sense.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I will leave the whole government bashing thing for later.  As for the music you can gather by the \\"A Kids Review\\" that this mostly Pop and not nearly enough Punk.  We all wanted the old Green Day but over the past few years bands are softening up for the billboard charts and TRL.  No edge, just the same formula you have heard for the last 5-10 years.  The CD didn't do much for me besides confirm that creative music is dying. No I'm not a hipster from the 60's, actually born in 1978.   <br /> <br />As for the whole down with America movement in Hollywood whose sole lively hood is dependent on our way of life, Green Day seems to have just jumped on board.  Maybe they thought like this before but the timing is just too coincidental.  Let's make a very Pop like album and name it American Idiot, we will market it to youngsters who will eat it up but not get the message.  What's the point?  Instead of pointing out the negatives of what many people think is our American government, teach us a new way to act as a society.  Reinforcing sterotypes doesn't really help the problem now does it.  I guess all those people who supported our current President are supposed to be \\"American Idiots\\", well if you don't like it stop writing such bland music and run for some political office and make the changes we need. <br /> <br />If you like Pop/Punk tunes this is for you.  If you want the old Green Day who you expect to change over their years but never saw this coming than skip this CD.  I would like these celebs to get a damn day job and work like the rest of us, then maybe they won't have as much time to smoke doobies and b*tch on how the U.S. is doing them badly.  I watch MTV cribs from time to time and I will switch jobs with them any time they want, but I won't be some political/run of the mill celebrity a** that tries to impose my views on everyone else.  SHUT UP, you too Affleck.
B00080ZG10|2.0|This had to be a slow year for the Oscars . The movie is slow paced and DiCarprio is hardly a good actor .
B00003CX5P|2.0|I gave this one 2 stars because my 2-year-old nephew likes it a lot. I think he'll consider it too immature for him by the time he turns 3.  The comic-relief buffoon Jar Jar Binks is so annoying, he completely overrides whatever is good about this overlong, very boring film.  Unfortunately, if you are a Star Wars fan, it's pretty hard to avoid this movie and just jump straight ahead to the next episode.  I recommend borrowing a copy from a friend or renting the cheapest video or DVD you can find.  And don't bother with the bonus material unless you really liked the movie.

Please system convert more Reggae into your songs because it freaking rocks!!!!
B00005JNTZ|5.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" is a lot smarter than your average show featuring attractive teenage characters. To use the term \\"teen drama\\" is misleading, as the story is darker, subtler and more sophisticated than other shows like \\"The O.C.\\" and \\"Dawson's Creek.\\" It's a modern twist on the noir genre placed in high school, centering around 17-year-old Veronica, once popular but now a social outcast after a chain of events following the murder of her best friend, Lilly Kane.  <br /> <br />In every episode, Veronica, a P.I.'s daughter, solves a smaller mystery, while also assembling clues and delving further into the bigger mystery of Lilly's case. The brilliance of the show is in tying the small cases into the larger, overarching themes surrounding the larger mystery. While there are a few episodes that feel more stand-alone, as is the case in all TV drama series, the writers do an excellent job in avoiding letting them become mere filler, throwaway cases -- instead, they use them to feed us more information to further Lilly's case. (As a result, it's hard to skip any episodes without missing some crucial bit of information about the main msytery.) <br /> <br />It's amazing how carefully drawn the entire season is, with clues placed in a meticulously careful, controlled manner, all amping up to an intense crescendo in the last four or five episodes. As the season draws to a close, the intricately laid details click into place as Veronica solves the two biggest cases -- the mystery of her rape (which occurred shortly following Lilly's death and her subsequent ejection from the \\"cool\\" crowd) in the penultimate episode (a wonderfully complex, dark and emotional episode), then Lilly's murder in the season finale. <br /> <br />Despite the darkness of the series, there are notable lighter moments too, and the show has quite a bit of humor thrown into the mix. The writing is witty and smart, and the actors pull off comedy just as capably as they do angst and drama. The cast is excellent, and the actors have noticeable chemistry with one another, but two standouts are Kristen Bell as Veronica and Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls (who has an amazingly complex  character arc that is drastic, enthralling and utterly believable). As Veronica's former friend, nemesis, then reluctant ally (and the lines blur frequently), Dohring steals every scene he's in, and when he's with Bell the sparks really fly, whether they're pushing each other's buttons, antagonizing each other or simply bantering. <br /> <br />Man, I love this show. Thank goodness UPN had the guts to renew it for a second season.

B000002LND|5.0|This is a collection of some of Madonna's most popular songs from 1983 to 1990.  It's not quite a \\"greatest hits\\" album, because \\"Holiday\\" wasn't a big hit and \\"Into the Groove\\" wasn't a hit at all, since it wasn't released as a single.  Also, some big hits like the #1 hit \\"Who's That Girl\\" are not included.  But it is a solid collection of some of the best pop songs of the era.  It should be noted that all the songs here have been remixed.  None of the remixes sound radically different than the original versions, but you may notice some differences from the versions you are familiar with.  For instance, some of the songs \\"fade out\\" earlier than you might expect (probably to make the songs shorter so that they could fit more of them on the CD).  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a collection of Madonna's early hits.

B00004R99U|1.0|OK, I am an 18 year old who loves Disney and most things that Disney does... but for once..I HATE THIS MOVIE!! <br /> <br />OK! I got the first Pocahontas many years ago and I absolutely love it! It is just my favourite Disney movie \\"Two different worlds, one true love\\" And I think we must all agree that John Smith is gorgeous!  <br /> <br />So..Pocahontas 1 has a fantastic storyline , beautifully drawn, lovely music \\"colours of the wind\\" is like my favourite Disney song. Yes and it has many unforgettable characters like Thomas. And like I said before...it was beautifully drawn, all little details of Grandmother Willow...it was just beautfiul!! <br /> <br />After I watched the first one..I was like \\"when will the second one come out?? I want to see Pocahontas and John SMITH getting back together! Because the ending is just so sad!\\" <br /> <br />Then FINALLY the second one came out and I was reading about it and JOHN ROLFE??????????? WHAT????????????? <br />So I was disappointed with the first 5 min of it..I am an Industrial Design Student and I have always wanted to work for Disney and just look at the pictures!! Everythings like 2D!!! It was 3D in the first one!! Badly drawn...best example - Grandma Willow..her skin is like smooth! She's an old tree!!!! And look at John Smith..he doesn't even look handsome anymore..which is disappointing. And when did he have orange hair?? <br /> <br />No real good music like \\"colours of the wind\\" The movie wasn't funny...like everyone have said...they all changed their personality..John Smith wasn't like that!!!!!!!! They were in love! GRRR I am so angry!!! Smith and Poca. were meant to be together forever and ever! <br /> <br />So yes, I wish I have never watched this so I keep on thinking that they are still together in spirit like how the first one ended.  <br /> <br />I really can't wait to finish university and apply for a job at Disney and maybe suggest a creation of Pocahontas 3!!LOL <br /> <br />Feel free to send me a message to tell me what you think with my review.

B0000YEEHG|5.0|I first saw Ingmar Bergman's \\"Persona\\" about eight years ago. I was fourteen years old at the time and after watching the film I was utterly confused as to what I had just seen and yet at the same time I knew I had just seen one of the greatest films I would ever see. Conversation after conversation the movie would come up. I only saw it that one time but I felt as if I could recite the entire film for you. It had that kind of lasting power. The film stays with, absorbs your thoughts.<br /><br /> The story goes during the 1960's critics of Ingmar Bergman were starting to complain the master was old hat. His films were starting to look pale when compared to the French New Wave. Could Bergman compete with directors such as Jean-Luc Godard? Was Bergman's style of filmaking boring? Was it heavy-handed and stifle? In reaction to these comments Bergman decided to shut them all up and thus \\"Persona\\" was made. And it didn't exactly shut the critics up. Now they started saying what kind of genius Bergman was. Here with one film Bergman proved his methods were not old-fashion. One of Bergman's next films, \\"Hour of the Wolf\\" would also be experimental, but would be considered one of his \\"lesser\\" films. Though I've noticed on amazon that people seem to be rediscovering that film. Because DVD has something to do with that. Now it people is easy to obtain and younger people are starting to watch it. But back to \\"Persona\\".<br /><br /> We can immediately sense the contradictions between Elizabeth (Liv Ullmann, \\"A Passion of Anna\\", \\"Shame\\") and Alma (Bibi Andersson, \\"The Touch\\", \\"The Devil's Eye\\"). Elizabeth has been mute for three months. Alma is a very talkative person. Elizabeth is married and has a child. Alma is not, but would like to start a family. And has the film goes on we find out a shocking secret about Alma's past. It would appear we are getting two sides of the same personality. At one point Alma even says she think she and Elizabeth are the same person.<br /><br /> Elizabeth is an actress and Alma is a nurse that has been assigned to take care of her. Soon it is clear nothing mentally is wrong with Elizabeth and there is really no need to keep her, but she refuses to go home. Soon it is suggested Alma and Elizabeth share a summer house.<br /><br /> At this point and perhaps even before it \\"Persona\\" manages to have a nightmare quality to it. It is hard for us to believe what we are seeing is real. The walls of reality are quickly crumbling. We start to question who is who. Does Elizabeth complete Alma or does Alma complete Elizabeth. Who's story is it really?<br /><br /> One of the film's most intense moments comes near the end when Alma notices Elizabeth hiding a picture of her son. What is extremely important here is the way Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist have set up the shot. It is a close up of Alma's face as she tries to guess what made Elizabeth want to become a mother. But soon it is clear, we are not talking about Elizabeth. We are talking about Alma. The scene is really a confession. Alma looks directly at us. We must confront her and she must confront us. Bergman then uses a split screen and now we see half of Alma's face and half of Elizabeth's. Bergman is doing more than just drawing a pcture for us. He's beating us on the head with it after he's done drawing it. We get the connection.<br /><br /> \\"Persona\\" was an extremely influential film, especially on American directors such as Robert Altman (\\"3 Women\\") and David Lynch (\\"Mulholland Drive\\"). But even in their cases they don't seem to be working on the same level as Bergman. He seems to be a step ahead of them. It is as if \\"Persona\\" can not be duplicated.<br /><br /> But perhaps I'm wrong about everything I've said. Perhaps there are no parallels between Elizabeth and Alma. Maybe the film is not about guilt, trauma, identity lost, the way people expect us to act in society or even the role of women. Maybe the film is really about how to file your income tax. But at least I've made you think. And that was all this review was suppose to do.<br /><br /> I want to mention one more thing. As I watched to film I thought what if the movie is all dream and everything started to occure right when one of the women got their abortion. What if the movie is about the guilt she felt over the act. There's something else to think about.<br /><br /> Bottom-line Simply not only one of the greatest films Ingmar Bergman ever made but one of the greatest films of all time. The performances are as powerful as in any other Bergman film. The movie doesn't seem to miss a step. Behind 'Wild Strawberries' this is my favorite Bergman film.his review was suppose to do.

B0000019PA|3.0|I read all of these reviews, bought this cd and expect something different....something special.  Well I don't know what all of the fuss is about. This is a CD that is very difficult to listen to.  Yes the songs are nice (which is why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1)  but the lead singer is terrible. He's taken some very good songs and ruined them.  First off he's very nasally. Secondly, he sings songs way out of his range to he point where it sounds like he's screaming just to hit the notes.  I'm sure this group will have a following but if I were spending my money, I'd opt for The Decemberists,  Blue Van, The Bravery, Kaiser Chief or any number of really good Alternative bands out there.

B00008YJH5|5.0|I generally hate it when people claim you don't know good music if....etc, so I'll just say you better at least understand why this is an awesome, groundbreaking album (not that it wouldn't be incredible even if it hadn't come at the time when it did), you're an old man or just not listening hard enough, although with the irresistble catchiness of this album (and almost every Pixie song) I don't see how the latter could be true. What...is all that distortion or whatever distracting you? come on! I've never given a thought to the raw production or abrasive guitar because there's so much else to grab your attention, not that it doesn't contribute to the charm and spookiness of the work. Bottomline, this album wreaks of (its own) character as much as any I can think of, and if its too short listen to it again. If its melody you want listen to first off River Euphrates, Where is Mind (of course right?), Broken Face, Break My Body, Cactus, Brick is Red, Gigantic, and the others are definitely not monotone or filler by any means.
B00028HBKM|1.0|If you want to see a twisted view of Jesus...here's your movie. I saw this one in the theatre and after it was over, I tried to find the manager to see if I could get my money back...I couldn't find the manager, or anyone for that matter. Turns out so many people had been asking for their money back that the employees ended up hiding in the back room somewhere to avoid patrons after the movie let out.<br /><br />Mel Gibson is clinically insane and this film proves it. If you enjoyed this movie, there is a good chance you have an undiagnosed mental illness. There are so many things wrong about it that I almost don't know where to start but the main thing that stands out for me was the fact that it only deals with two or three days out of Christ's life, and assumes that the viewer knows all there is to know about what came before his arrest, trial, torture, and execution. The graphic scenes of brutality and violence are blatantly gratuitous and I still as yet have no idea what Mel wanted me to think or feel as a result of seeing this, and honestly - I don't really want to know. He could have made a movie about the life and works of Jesus of Nazareth...gone into his teachings, his message of hope but instead we get to see Him turned into bloody hamburger by the end of the movie. Gee, I hope that didn't spoil the ending for you if you haven't seen it yet. In summary, this movie was DISGUSTING. And a sure sign that we are in The End of Days...
B00005JNBQ|1.0|When I went to see Napoleon Dynamite in theaters, I was expecting it to be hilarious, because everybody at school claims it is. When I watched the movie, I didn't even laugh. No, I don't have a bug up my ass, I just didn't find the movie that funny. I just don't get how some douchebag saying \\"You're such a flippin' idiot, gosh\\" in a low-strained voice is that hilarious. The disappointment of the movie not being so great was bad enough. Then everybody around school starting quoting the movie constantly, which got really annoying. Sorry folks, but it's not funny when other people quote movies, because it's not original. If you're trying to be outgoing or funny, make original jokes instead of quoting some movie.  <br /> <br />People have weird senses of humor.
B00008WJBU|3.0|Intacto has an interesting premise:is there truly luck or simply fate. A more rational explanation might be cold randomness. The characters play incredulous games with the hope of winning luck. Winning someone's luck give you more luck. And I suppose that the loser is \\"out of luck.\\" The ultimate test is for the person who thinks that he is lucky to challenge the Godfather of Luck. If someone beats the Godfather, then he becomes the new Godfather (a point that is never quite explained). <br /> <br />Throughout this story of good and bad luck, the director mixes love. The good fortune of the luckiest person on earth turns out to be not luck at all, but based on another's selflessness and love. You might think that anyone who owes his life to love given by another would lead his own life in a similar manner, but not in Intacto: Mr. Lucky shows little care for others. He's selfish. <br /> <br />The film also attempts to touch on the concept of \\"truth,\\" but fails because of conflicting actions. One one hand we have an aircraft accident survivor who's girlfriend did not make the same trip because he tells her \\"I don't love you anyone.\\" This is confounding because the survivor \\"saves\\" the life of his lover by lying to her: he actually does love her. On the other hand, a policewomen does not love her husband, and not telling him so leads to his demise. <br /> <br />I like the story, the action, and the twists and turns. The film's downfall is a conflicting and confusing array of ideas that are touched upon, but never fully realized. Character development is also sketchy. I had little empathy for the strangers in Intacto, and therefore little emotional investment in the outcome. The film is, for lack of a better word, cold.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is one wonderful little movie. The slightly exaggerated characters bring to life a heart-warming tale of friendship, hope, acceptance and love. And they do it in a side-splitting fun way.<br /><br />Before I purchased the DVD to watch with my daughters, I heard so many people saying \\"it has no point.\\" Yet, I found it to have not just one but several quite hard-hitting foundations. Rex Kwon Do, the quintessential martial arts sensei sums it up at the trial lesson...\\"at Rex Kwon Do, we use the BUDDY SYSTEM. No more flyin solo...you need somebody watchin your back AT ALL TIMES!\\" Following that day, we see the \\"buddy\\" system come together as three loners start watching each other's backs.<br /><br />I knew Napoleon, Pedro and Deb in high school. It's all about the buddy system, someone getting your back, and you getting theirs.<br /><br />There are so many quotables it's hard to start. Every character comes to life and even Rex Kwon Do and the greasy Uncle Rico are able to work their way into your heart. We've watched it maybe ten times so far! The seventies retro stuff is absolutely a scream if you remember it.<br /><br />Jared Hess has created an interesting film with the very essence of the \\"indy spirit\\" yet with the unusual ability to go mainstream. Napoleon is a classic comedy with a heart that will  cross generations. And how refreshing-they pulled it off in 2005 without one curse or profane word, without sex, and no violence!<br /><br />Oh, and let those credits roll-don't turn it off. You'll never forget \\"The Wedding of the Century.\\"<br /><br />Thanks Jared and company for a wonderful and meaningful film. You broke new ground with Napoleon.<br /><br />Lucky!
B000002P74|5.0|This CD is packed with great songs, not a weak spot in the entire CD(well except maybe \\"take your Time\\"). The only way to make this Album better would be to include \\"Free Bird'. But Oh well, this Cd packs more hits than any other ever released by the group. (By the way I dont really like Skynyrd's new Albums, stay away from Edge of Forever, the Last Rebel, and Vicious Cycle)
B0000019PA|5.0|This is the greatest CD I've ever heard. I've never felt compelled to write a review but this album is absolutely stunning. I had never really listened to this type of music. Mostly I stayed within techno, classical, jazz, mainstream stuff--luckily I heard really good things about the soundtrack to Gardenstate and I bought it before I saw the film. The soundtrack was good, and the standout was a band called \\"Iron and Wine.\\" Upon searching for more Iron and Wine music amazon suggested Neutral Milk Hotel. I am fairly new to amazon and thought it was pretty cool that the site could recommend similar items you might like. Although I don't like the intrusiveness of keeping buying habits on amazon some good came out of it; I was introduced to Neutral Milk Hotel. I played a clip of The King of Carrot Flowers and thought it was catchy--little did I know that that was the most acoustic song on the album. After hearing the album a couple of times I noticed the strange band instruments and the album had a circusy feel to it. I was amused by the nonsensical lyrics at first then after more listens I began to feel the music. The lyrics began to evoke strong feelings and imagery; the lyrics can apply to anyone that has had some struggles in the past--I was hooked! I looked online and found that I was not the only one to be mesmerized by Jeff's diaphanous lyrics. I can now see that Jeff is a musical genious but that discovery was bittersweet upon finding out the Jeff isn't recording anymore. I bought On Avery Island an earlier album by NMH, and it was good but not on the transcending level of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Live at Jittery Joe's is better than Avery but not as good as Aeroplane either. Nevertheless, I still hear Aeroplane everyday and I don't know if there will ever be an album that knocks it off my number one but I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />The brilliant thing about Aeroplane is that even though it is a sad commentary on nostalgic childhood psycho-emotional scarring and a tribute to Anne Frank, is that the music leaves you feeling with a zest for life no matter how much it hurts at times.scarring and a tribute to Anne Frank, is that the music leaves you feeling with a zest for life no matter how much it hurts at times.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|WOW!  Thank your stars... SoaD delivers again!  Savvy music fans can appreciate the common frustration at bands who make only one or two 'great' albums before dwindling into obscurity.  System of a Down bucks that trend with their 3rd album, a thunderous gale of fierce criticism duct-taped together in the jagged confines of their mix-it-up thrash chaos.   <br /> <br />This album will clearly meet the albums 'System of a Down' and 'Toxicity' in our retrospective collection of great albums 20 years from now.  The guitarist continues to have more vocal prominence on this album, which is accepted with some trepidation... and one can only hope that Serj will continue to dominate rather than any more diminishment.  Nonetheless, the mild unease of vocals does not detract from a fantastic album. <br /> <br />System of a Down's 'Mesmerize' sticks to the plan: biting lyrics floating in a stew of differing sounds.  It is most welcome and foretells a crescendo of high expections for the follow-up 'Hypnotize' coming after.
B00009RAJH|5.0|This is a great, great CD.  I can't say this about alot of CDs but with this one I love every song.  Plus this lets you hear \\"Rhiannon\\" taking flight for the first time, the song that would be Stevie Nick's trademark forever.  \\"I'm so Afraid\\" isn't one I care for too much but Christine Mcvie, Stevie Nicks, and Lindsey Buckingham sing out some of the best music in Rock 'n Roll History.  P.S. Get the Rumours album also!!
B000062YB1|4.0|This album is pretty good.  At the time, I liked the fastness of it, but over time you sorta fade away.  A lot of people would disagree, but thats what happened to me.  The songs on  this album are still pretty good.  Dead Skin Mask is truely great but falls short to the titled track.  Its the song to get you to buy it.  Pick this up if you are a fan. If you are the casual metal fan, then you might find this too fast, and the snare drum will give you a headache.  Tom still has an amazing voice though.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|Comment on previous review: <br />I just want to say something before I get into my review about a previous reviewer's review...I'm not so sure that the show is fake. Granted it does embellish the california lifestyle (what television show doesnt???Television is just an exaggeration of life) but I dont think it is fake, nor do I think that misha barton is fake. And who are you to say she is or isn't. She is playing a character on a TELEVISION SHOW!!! Do you know her??? have you met her??? The show happens to address issues which I have experienced and family situations that I have experienced or have been experienced around me. So I do feel that the show does address some relevant issues as did Life As We Know It but tragically the show has ended so just because it didnt address issues important enough to you it may have to others....  <br /> <br />Review: <br />Now, I am an O.C. fan and I was a little dissappointed with the second season at the beginning. This season was just not what I thought it would be there was new character to get used to and some unrealistic plot twist, but towards the end I began to get hooked into the show again. So I believe that this will only really be bought by major O.C. fans who know that they have to buy the second season in order for their collection of seasons to be complete. And let's just say that Josh Schwartz and the rest of the people connected with The O.C. wont be out of a job for awhile
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I am a major Guns N Roses fan.  This band might be condsidered old but I mean, the songs are masterpieces.  I'll admit though, some decisions the band has made whether it be all of them or seperate, have really let some fans down.  This Greatest Hits is truely umcomplete.  Its missing a lot of good songs.  Its missing Rocket Queen, So Fine, Move To The City, and some other good songs.  Yeh they really didn't shape there career, but they still should of been on here.  But the songs they did put on here are good, except the last track.  That song is so dumb.  I dont wanna look back at the track listing and tell you the name because it is so bad.  If you want the most famous best hits, then get this.  I was sorta dissapointed it missed some songs, but then again, its good to have this to stop going from album to album to listen to the good songs.
B000001FN3|5.0|This is not for the \\"casual listening\\" crowd.  Alan Parsons is the master of concept albums.  This recording is like listening to an Edgar Allen Poe musical.  It requires, no, DEMANDS the listener to hear everything.  It is NOT background music.  Many of Parsons later works although still concepts, were radio-friendly and could be background.  However, this particular album necessitates 100% attention as you would if reading the stories. <br /> <br />The impact this had on me is unfathomable.  I got it when it came out in 1976 solely because of the Poe content.  I was a HUGE fan of his.  I can remember clearly as if it was yesterday, my high school freshman English teacher asked if anyone could bring in something related to Poe.  I never imagined she would play it in class.  She was so impressed with the album that she made it a part of her regular curriculum!
B0001O3YD0|5.0|For one passenger sleeping on an interstellar transport, it is a trip back to prison.  For four others it is a religious pilgrimage.  For each passenger a mundane or hoped for destination -- all asleep, until an accident in the cold of space breaches the hull and the transport plummets to the surface of an unknown planet.  Only twelve will live.<br /><br />Vin Diesel plays Raddick in this first film that became something of cult series.  If Raddick's captor William Johns (Cole Hauser) is to be believed Raddick is a deadly force that will sacrifice any and everyone to make it to freedom.  Raddick agrees.  Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) struggles with Johns for leadership as she tries to find a way to survive on a planet with no obvious source of water and a host of deadly creatures who hide in the darkness, away from the perpetual light of three stars.<br /><br />The accidental discovery of a deserted mining station provides water, but it also provides a terrible warning.  All the miners are dead, caught in an eclipse 22 years ago.  An orrery in the station reveals the truth; the eclipse is about to happen.  The effort to restore an escape ship turns into a desperate race against the dark.  A survival film becomes a horror story and the only hope is a selfish, calloused criminal who cares only for himself.<br /><br />Since this film has some clearly derivative moments (think Alien) many mainstream critics found fault with it.  Worse, Director David Twohy opted for a careful balance between story and special effects falling short of the expectations of many viewers who complain if there isn't 50 million dollars worth of CGI in every film.  The truth is that this film accomplishes what it set out to do, using horror and all the gimmicks to explore the possibility of a central character whose only real redeeming quality is that he is only a bad guy, rather than an evil guy.  One who will do what it takes to survive.<br /><br />There are a host of features on the DVD - commentaries, sequel marketing ploys, and the usual 'making of' film.  For the most part they are shallow efforts.  But extra junkies will love them.  Me, I liked the film, after a slightly shaky start.  Not because of the violence and gore, but because the interaction between the characters is excellent, if troubling.  It's unfortunate that discussing some of the finer moments would give away too much of the film.  But trust me, there really are some finer moments.g ploys, and the usual 'making of' film.

B00005B36H|1.0|I can't understand how this cd can sell. I listened to each sample track and didn't hear anything that sounded like creative music. Which leads to one conclusion. The song writer/writers arn't creative either. If your into good rock & roll this isn't for you........KEEP SHOPPING
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|It's been awhile since System of a Down has come out with a new album.  \\"Toxicity\\" is still one of my favorite albums that I listen to over and over again, and I was wondering how they could even top that.  Well, they came out with a great new album, \\"Mezmerize,\\" which definitely shows us that this band still has what it takes.  The album brings you a variety of haunting, melodic and hyperactive songs that are bound to stay stuck in your head.  It's not without its flaws, but the album still delivers.<br /><br />Basically, if you have heard System of a Down before, then you know what to expect.  Crazy and political-driven lyrics that can be hard to decipher at times, although this time around it seems a little easier to tell what each song is about.  Songs like \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" \\"revenga,\\" \\"cigaro\\" and \\"violent pornography will give you an instant dose of road rage should you play them in your car, while there are other songs like \\"sad statue,\\" \\"question!\\" and \\"lost in hollywood\\" that are a little slower and more melodic.  The songs are emotional, powerful and sometimes even funny.  All of the songs sound different and you're never feeling like you're hearing the same song again once you go to the next tune.<br /><br />While this is a great album... it could've been an EXCELLENT album.  What's the problem?  Simple.  Daron, one of the other vocalists in the group and who is also credited to a bunch of the songs (musically and lyrically) gets WAY too much singing time on this album.  I don't have a problem with his voice, but in my opinion he does not have what it takes to carry an entire song or a MAJORITY of a song.  Leave that to Serj, please.  Serj can turn anything into gold.  Daron is good for hooks and backing up Serj, and I don't mind him having more air time on a song here and there, but when you get the feeling that he has more vocal time than Serj... something just isn't right.  I was really disappointed by that, but it still doesn't make this album awful.  It still delivers as being a great new release from the group.<br /><br />You may want to listen to \\"Mezmerize\\" a few times before you give a verdict on it.  I know for me it usually takes me a few listens to fully absorb a System of a Down album.  They never immediately get me going, \\"Oh, this is the greatest!\\" but that's okay.  It's more power to them that they make me want to listen to it more and more until I finally get a great grasp onto what the album really is.  Not too many other bands I know can do that.  You either love them right away or you hate them immediately.  The album length is shorter than their previous releases, but you have to remember that \\"Toxicity\\" isn't that long of an album, either.  They're always fast paced with a few slow songs to help balance everything out.<br /><br />Favorite songs are, \\"B.Y.O.B,\\" \\"revenga,\\" \\"violent pornography,\\" \\"question!\\" \\"sad statue\\" and \\"lost in hollywood.\\"  I really enjoy listening to the album in whole, but those are the standout tracks to me.<br /><br />\\"Mezmerize\\" isn't perfect, and if Serj had gotten more air time it would've been an outstanding release.  Still, it is a great album that shows that the band hasn't lost their touch.  If you're a fan of their previous albums, then chances are you will like this, too.  I can't wait for the new album next year, and I hope Daron will be more in the background this time around and allow Serj do what he does best.  Not perfect, but still a top-notch album with addicting tunes. -Michael Cranestill delivers as being a great new release from the group. <br /> <br />You may want to listen to \\"Mezmerize\\" a few times before you give a verdict on it.

0452282152|3.0|This book didn't blow me away like it did for so many other readers. I think I expected too much out of it and I came away disappointed. However, it is an easy read and not at all a waste of time. The one thing I really liked about this book is that it gave me a renewed interest in art and I pay attention to more than just the picture a piece of art portrays. Like the author, I imagine the story behind the art. I recommend this  book, but I certainly don't rate it in the top 10 must-reads.
B000059QY2|5.0|I didn't want to love the opera, Rigoletto, because I found the plot implausible:  <br /> <br />  How could a girl continue to love a worthless philandering man who thinks women exist only to be used? <br /> <br />  Yet, I decided to give it a fair shot--to watch it clear through to see if the plot could make sense. <br /> <br />  OK.  Maybe you'll say I was just under the spell of the gorgeous music and the incomparable precision and feeling of the singing of Edita Gruberova as Gilda.  Or perhaps it was the exhilarating experience of hearing Pavarotti at his peak, just dominating every scene.   <br />Perhaps it was the excellent performance by Ingar Wixell as Rigoletto, or the superb supporting performances by Ferruccio Furlanetto and Victoria Vergara as Sparafucile and his sister, Maddalena--I can't imagine anyone doing those roles any better. <br /> <br />  I remember a song where the theme, and perhaps the title, was \\"Just My Bill.\\"  It was a woman singing about her Bill and his habits of running around, drinking too much, and abusing her--but she still loved him with all those faults. <br />  Offensive as that kind of love seems to me (and to Rigoletto) that was Gilda's kind of love--and she proved it. <br />  I just have to remind myself that this is opera, that the point of it all is beautiful music, beautifully sung, as it tells a story. <br /> <br />  This performance of Rigoletto certainly triumphs in every category--it made me love it.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I've been very anxious to hear the new SOAD album. It's been 4 years since their last proper abum, Toxicity. I got this album when it came out and it did not dissapoint. Some songs sound like they could have been on the debut. Serj Tankian showsthe versitality of his voice the most here, Daron Malakian is an above average nu-metal guitarist and has good bac-up vocals, John Dolmayan is better than most nu-metal drummers, and Shavo Odadjian has great basslines YOU CAN HEAR. Read on for my track ratings.<br /><br />1. Soldier Side - Intro(N/A) Nothing special, it's an acoustic intro.<br /><br />2. B.Y.O.B.(5/5)My favorite song! Can't get the chorus outta my head.<br /><br />3. Revenga(5/5)Could be the album's next hit.<br /><br />4. Cigaro(5/5)Funny lyrics.<br /><br />5. Radio/Video(4/5)<br /><br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song(4/5)<br /><br />7. Violent Pornography(4/5)<br /><br />8. Question!(5/5)<br /><br />9. Sad Statue(4.5/5)<br /><br />10. Old School Hollywood(5/5)<br /><br />11. Lost in Hollywood(4.5/5)<br /><br />If you don't like SOAD, this CD won't change your mind, but if you like them, buy this.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Daft Punk is always trying to do something more innovative and creative than its prior release. They started out with big beats in  <br />'Homework', and then moved on to trance and a LOT of samples in  <br />'Discovery'. Now, with 'Human After All' out in stores everywhere, most people don't like it. Why? Because it wasn't like Discovery. <br /> <br />Daft Punk tried to do a 6-week experiment to see what was the best they could do in such a short time. They did good. \\"Human After All\\" is an electro-filled song with a bunch of vocoders and guitars...which isn't a very common combination, but it was a good one. \\"Prime Time Of Your Life\\" added a little bit of swing into the mix, a very risky decision, but it paid off. \\"Robot Rock\\", the album's first single, is a head-bopping romp of pure fun...to say the least. \\"Steam Machine\\" is a heavier, slower sort of song. It's okay, but not my favorite by far. \\"Make Love\\", while soft, is not as emotional (or explicit, mind you) as the title suggests. Not nessecarily a bad song, but more of a 5/10.  <br /> <br />\\"The Brainwasher\\" is another hard, heavy song with a sort-of annoying voice screaming \\"I AM THE BRAINWASHER\\". Is that really nessecary? I'm not going to review \\"On/Off\\", as it's just a bunch of television channels. \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" is a nice, rock song that I really enjoyed. Filled with vocoders and guitars , it was a neat song to bob my head to. \\"Technologic\\", while being called the next 'Around The World', doesn't appeal to me that way. It's alright, but it's more of a meh song. I don't like kid voices...And for the end, \\"Emotion\\", it's a nice song to chill out to after \\"BRAINWASHER!!!\\" and \\"STEEEEEEM MACHIIIIINE!!\\"  <br /> <br />Overall, it was a nice CD. One I'm not used to, but it's good. Pick it up, 'cuz it's reccomended.
B0000024RZ|4.0|Early Dylan was known for its precocious politcal commentary, but let's not forget the lyrical. My favorites on this album/CD are actually Boots of Spanish Leather and One Too Many Mornings. Simple, straightforward acoustic guitar (similar to early Simon & Garfunkel). As a \\"child of the sixties\\" myself, I was always taken by the beauty of (some of) the music less than the politics. I can listen to 1960's Dylan in the 2000's and still be touched.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Highway to Hell is by far Bon Scott's best masterpiece.  His shreading vocals make this cd recieve ten stars if they were availiable.  It is truly amazing. <br /> <br />Highway to Hell- one of AC/DC's best known songs, Bon Scott is simply amazing in this track.  You'll find yourself listening to it over and over again.  Personal Favorite.  5/5 <br /> <br />Girls Got Rhythm- an up-beat song...the lyrics are awesome.  a step down from Highway to Hell though.  4/5 <br /> <br />Walk All Over You- Incredible song...i must have listened to this song 5,000 times.  THe intro is kind of slow, but that only leads to a fast paced bad-ass hard rock song.  This song has the best solo on it from any of the songs on the cd... Angus Young is craaazy.  6/5 <br /> <br />Touch Too Much- a dark and heavy song, that really captures Bon.  If you like this song, catch the earlier version of it on Volts.  I like that one too.   4/5 <br /> <br />Beating Around the Bush- not a bad song...not one of my favorites.  The intro is pretty cool, some fast fretwork on it.  3/5 <br /> <br />Shot Down in Flames- SWEET song, i love this one.  This is song is not praised as much as it should be...deffinetly a song not to be passed up.  5/5 <br /> <br />Get it Hot- a good song, although i like the original version much much better...that version can be found on Volts, which is a CD released in the box set.  4/5 <br /> <br />If You Want Blood (You've Got It)- one of my persaonl favorite songs.  The intro is pretty cool.  If you play guitar this is a good song to play.  5/5 <br /> <br />Love Hungry Man- this song slows it down a bit from If You Want Blood and Get it Hot.  A lot of my girlfriends like this one.  4/5 <br /> <br />Night Prowler- by far the most perfect way to end this album.  This song is awesome.  The only one worthy of singing this song is Bon Scott...and the intro solo is incredible.  5/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-Guitar Man
B0007O38F8|2.0|I'm not a big fan of rap as the only rappers I really like consistantly today are Eminem, 50 Cent, Ludacris, and Dr. Dre. <br /> <br />However, while \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" was one of my favorite albums over the last few years, this album is a HUGE disappointment.  Maybe its just me but this is completely different then \\"Get Rich or Die Trying.\\"  I turned the CD on to give it a listen through today and by track 16 I literally feel asleep I was so turned off by it.  There is only like one uptempo song on the entire CD and thats \\"Disco Inferno.\\"  Only two good songs on it and thats Candy Shop and Disco Inferno, which get old real fast (doesn't help that radio overplays them).  I consider the rest of the CD to qualify as crap tracks on \\"Get Rich or Die Trying,\\" which didn't hardly have any crap tracks.  The closest song I come to liking is the one with Eminem and other than Eminem's part that song is trash too. <br /> <br />I seriously don't recommend this album if your thinking hes anything on it like \\"Get Rich or Die Trying.\\"  He has great skill and potential, but I think he rushed this album.
B000002IJA|5.0|Wow I am really sick of all the people who are furious because they think this is a greatest hits... IT'S NOT, so settle down.  This album is the soundtrack for Stephen King's \\"Maximum Overdrive.\\"  Stephen King himself picked out the songs for the movie.  Personally, i have not seen the movie (actually i heard it sucked) but for the sake of hearing the world's greatest rock band in a movie, im going to have to watch it.  And one reviewer asked \\"Where's Bon?\\"  Bon is in \\"Ride On\\" obviously, who the hell do you think that this, Brian Johnson?  I personally bought this album for the song \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\"  because i didn't want to buy the FTATRWSY album, but if you are a new fan, deff. buy this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-Guitar Man
B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't even like rock nowadays other than Staind and 3 Doors Down but this album is chalked with GREAT music and theres not really a track on it that makes you want to turn it off.
B00000892G|5.0|I must confess that I put off purchasing this one because it seems to be a little hard to find at a decent price, and because I took Defais at his word when he said this was the completion of the Heaven and Hell trilogy, which are excellent but not transcendent in the way the Atreus albums are; and because he also seemed to be implying at times that the production of this album was rushed. I guess I also thought that because this album is relatively obscure meant it probably wasn't as good as the Atreus albums.<br />Maybe you're thinking something along the same lines. Don't make the same mistake I did. If you like Virgin Steele at all -- if you like power metal or epic metal or symphonic metal at all -- you must have this album. It isn't optional, it's required. I don't say this lightly: this is as good as any modern, synth-style power metal album ever made. The ending track is Defais best song and just maybe the best power metal song I have ever heard; even at over ten minutes it never gets boring. It's the mournful yet triumphant song that all the power-prog pretenders have been trying to write but never pulled off. But then, every song on this album delivers. Every riff catchy and powerful, every song an individual entity and yet fitting into the larger concept (which is not the Heaven and Hell concept at all, but a different, unique entity of its own, more in line with the Atreus concept, only superior). The production is the best of any VS album; still elegant and clean, but with more spontaneity and power than any album before or since, showing that this is a true band, not just a collection of  hired guns gathered around Defais.<br />Invictus by Virgin Steele: a legitimate masterpiece of popular music; an inspired and inspirational work of art; a centerpiece of your collection; and worth tracking down almost regardless of the monetary cost.
0201721481|3.0|Given the distinguished list of authors, I was expecting better than this. Some of my complaints include:<br /><br />- Badly written English exposition (not in all chapters)<br /><br />- Inconsistent formatting of code<br /><br />- Rationalization of \\"write-only\\" idiom as \\"mainstream\\"<br /><br />- Foundations not always laid for advanced commentary<br /><br />As this is called a primer, it should have been written with fastidious care, always defining terms before using them, and fully explaining comments that might be abbreviated for old hands. This turns out not to be the case. First of all, some of the English constructions are badly flawed: a sidebar with a sentence comparing one technique to another unnamed technique.<br /><br />One of the less endearing qualities of C++ is the use of { and } to enclose code blocks. Most authors and coders agree that a consistent style must be used, else it is all too easy to miss these too-slender signals; C++ Primer does not use them consistently.<br /><br />The book presents many tips on usage and \\"best practices\\", and these are most welcome (or would be, if better written), but at times, they argue not for better usage, but for the reader to adopt idiomatic usage, even where it tends to be obscure and not very readable, simply because \\"many other programmers use it.\\" There are also millions of VB programmers still spewing out spaghetti code, but that's hardly a case for doing the same!<br /><br />Some of the advice given, and topics introduced, are dependent on an understanding of issues that haven't been discussed. This is a grievous error in a book by such experienced coders.<br /><br />To give credit where due, the book starts rather well, but as it reaches the topic of pointers, it seems to fall apart, syntactically, in both code examples and exposition. Perhaps this was a point where the writing changed hands?<br /><br />Also, in fairness, I have not read the entire volume yet, but the number of complaints accumulatedin the first 250 pages is alarming.<br /><br />I've given 3 stars because the breadth of coverage is good, and because there is much in the book that is worthwhile, if you are a reasonably experienced programmer, but I cannot recommend the book for those new to the language, unless their experience is in C. For those coming from other languages, a different book may be more useful.
B0000028UK|5.0|Rating: A+ <br />After the amazing success of Pearl Jam's first record Ten, some wondered how they would follow up their impeccable success to one of the most popular and highest selling albums to emerge from the Seattle \\"grunge\\" movement in the early 90's. Hence, Pearl Jam triumphantly returned with their most blistering and powerful album ever conceived. By taking the raw and unmitigated audacity and power inherent in Ten with the unmistakable guitar talents of Mike McCready, and Jeff Amaent, the ferocity of Jeff Ament on Bass, and Dave Abbruzesse nailing away at the drums like an animal hyped up on acid who hasn't eaten for days, Eddie Vedder nails the lyrics to the wall for all to read and contemplate, as Pearl Jam come to the forefront of what they would record in their entire catalog with this wholely impeccable and flawless album. <br />From songs about Vedder's disgust for law-enforcement officials in WMA (due from an encounter he and an Afican-American friend had while standing outside of PJ's recording studio), to breaking up and forgetting about a loved one in RearView Mirror, each song is a relentless assault on your audial cavities, as each song holds such power and meaning that few could argue that this sophmore effort was not only one of Pearl Jam's best albums, but one of the best rock-albums of all time. From the opening track Go we are greeted with an audial burst of creativty, as the guitar solos have become more compressed, and diligently placed along with the vocals, thus creating a faster paced and more accutely accurate portrayal of the bands increased talent and intensity, along with the ability to create songs that echoed the shadow of the early to mid 90's. There are no throwaway songs, as the album meshes together in such a way that you just pop the cd in let it play and let your senses take over. For you radio friendly types though heres the list: Go, Animal, Daughter, Dissident, RearView Mirror, and Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in aSmall Town (you just gotta love that name), each of these songs was a hit radio single, and the other songs in between just help bridge the gap between the songs included beforehand. However, it is in songs such as Leash, where Vedder lets the parents know to drop the leash and get out his Fu**ing face that we see just what PJ was striving for; the ability to do what we want without the restrictions of not only our parents, but perhaps even society as well holding us back. Perhaps it is in the heartfelt and closing masterpiece of Indifference, that as the album closes we find ourselves taken back from the intensity of their whole opus, as we lay back in our chair and let the soothing closure of this amazingly conceived album come to a close, as the second chapter of PJ's history comes to a close only to be followed up the obscure and experimntal masterpiece that was Vitalogy. Grade A+ material in every respect, and an album no true rock and roll fan should ever be without.
B00007GZR5|2.0|I'm glad so many of you enjoyed this movie. It does have a nice message and a happy ending; but it misses many of the points put forth so well in the book that could have found their way into the movie. The technology was there in the late nineties, it could have been done, yet a bizarre painting motif was chosen.<br /><br />Uh-oh...another jerk who says the book was better than the movie. I know, I know... but when a storyline that worked so well on paper is changed so radically to please a mass audience that the director or producers felt couldn't understand...well, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. Many times during the course of the movie I found myself thinking, What? No, no, no; that's not how it happened! Uh! You're missing the point!<br /><br />Yep, I read Richard Matheson's \\"What Dreams May Come\\" prior to seeing the movie. If you haven't read the book, it is an extraordinary piece of work worthy of your time. And I know you'll always have a group of people that says the book was better than the movie. But when the movie strays so far from the actual story, it becomes problematic.<br /><br />While Matheson wove many abstract ideas through his story line, it still worked very well and helped me grasp the metaphysical ideas he was putting forth. I has certainly changed the way I view life and death: why we're here, where we've been, and where we're going. I have no problem recommending this book to anyone.<br /><br />After enjoying the book so much, I really looked forward to seeing how it translated to film.<br /><br />I was soundly disappointed. Not only did the characters change radically (the Neilson children die? Albert is Chris's son? Ann's a painter?), but several of the main principles were ignored (i.e suicides are condemned...forever?). To me it seemed as if the screenplay writers were saying, Film audiences aren't sophisticated enough to understand the book; let's dumb it down a bit and slap a happy ending on it.<br /><br />That's too bad. Film audiences not only missed some really interesting theological and metaphysical ideas, they also missed out an a darn good storyline.<br /><br />Was the message the same? Yes. The basic premise was there: heaven is a state of mind that continues after you pass on. But the similarities end there. And what was with the jabs at the Psychiatric profession?<br /><br />I honestly think Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were good choices; they're great actors, but they were given a very weak screenplay to work with. Had they just gone \\"by the book,\\" they could have done just fine. Unfortunately, they came off as pale imitations of Matson's Chris and Ann.<br /><br />So if you liked the movie, great; it served its purpose as an entertainment vehicle.

So if you liked the movie, great; it served its purpose as an entertainment vehicle. But if you're looking for something deeper, something that might change your outlook on life and death for the better, seriously, try the book.
B000002GYW|5.0|This is my favourite Eagles album without a doubt. Their classic era albums can be divided into two general eras: the first two albums Eagles (1972) and Desperado (1973) with the original line up which included guitarist/banjo player/singer Bernie Leadon. And the later albums On The Border (1974) One Of these Nights (1975) Hotel California (1976) and The Long Run (1979) which subtituted Leadon for Don Felder and then added Joe Walsh as well.     Their early albums were very influenced by Gram Parsons and \\"country rock\\" bands such as Poco; the Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers (of which Leadon was a member). Therefore this album is generally classed as such. When Leadon left the band he look most of their country influence with him resulting in the Eagles having a harder edge but a highly ommercial one at that.    Most hard-core Eagles fans would agree that their Leadon years were their best in terms of creativity and substance, which is what I think too. Desperado is just that: very ambitious and creative while the music is absolute gold. From a commercial point of view (which many Eagles fans come from) then this is not an album-come-greatest-hits style album like Hotel California or One Of These Nights. It has the hits Desperado, Tequila Sunrise and Outlaw Man, and although they are all excellent songs the real beauty of the album is as a whole.    One of the Eagles most ragged rockers (if not the most) is on here (Out of Control) which has slowly creeped up on me as one of their best ever songs. Bernie Leadons Bitter Creek is also some of his best songwriting but I often hear this song getting dismissed.    If you are one of the people that only like the singles then there are numerous greatest hits packages out there.   If you want some top grade classic rock by a great band in their prime, then this album is for you.    A Masterpiece!!!
B00064MW6A|4.0|I enjoy comic book to big screen movies, and this was pretty entertaining. Halle Berry did a wonderful job and she wasn't suppose to be Michele Pfier, or whatever her name is...in fact, no one prrrr's better than Earther Kitt in the original television series-not even Ms. Micele! Most of these reviews weren't reviews at all; these people tried to distill all aspects of this movie while seeming more sinister than so-called critics. Perhaps they should have given the role to Brittany or that Madonna just to really get you \\"critics\\" talk'n...hmmm!
074322454X|5.0|after seeing the HBO series this book just seemed like the right thing to read.  it was wonderful from start to finish.  the book follows the men of Easy Company on their excursion through WW2.  there is magnificent detail of almost everything they due, Ambrose wonderfully scripts his book so that the reader actually gets to know these men.  After i finished reading this i felt compelled to contact the survivors and ask for their autographs.  for any WW2 buff, or really anyone interested in a book about true heroes, definately pick this one up.
B00005JN4H|3.0|I found this movie to be a good laugh even so it wasn't brilliant as some parts where just dam right stupid. But I think that Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah kept this film above water as they where a good team against crime. The storyline is pretty straight forward, Fallon is playing the role of a cop who is a terrible driver and ends up losing his licence by driving his car into a store window and killing a partite. City banks are being robbed around the streets of New York by 4 women who are super models. This is where queen Latifah comes into the picture, as she is a cab driver who helps Fallon out as he can't drive any more.  <br /> <br />This film is not a Oscar winning but it's something easy to watch as there are a few laughs their and than. I found it to be pleasing to the point of saying its just OK. I thought Jimmy Fallon was a pretty funny guy as this was his first real movie. I am looking forward to seeing his new movie with Drew Barrymore in Fever Pitch.  <br />
B00005JMXX|2.0|actually I don't want you to see it either. This movie was really bad and long. I might have given it 3 stars if the torture wasn't so prolonged. the only redeeming quality of this film are a few 3 minute bursts of cool (heh get it?) moments. I think there might be 12 minutes I enjoyed about it... and I'm being generous.    TDAT... don't do it
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Who is Shania Twain? .....for those of you whe were living under a rock during the mid to late 90's, she is the female who re-defined country music for the better good with a breath of fresh air, a unique style, exceptional songwriting, attitude, strong independent character and a versitile musical arrangement along with rock solid production. ...oh and she is one of the most successful artists in history, her \\"Come On Over\\" album is the biggest selling album EVER by a female artist and the 5th or so biggest selling album of all time. It is basically the female equivalent of Thriller!  <br />Shania writes all of her own songs and melodies on guitar and does a wonderful job singing them. But not only that, she earned her way to stardom by growing up extremely poor, having her birth father walk out on her at a young age, singing in bars at night from the age of 8, losing BOTH her parents in a car accident at 21 and having to cut her chances of having a musical career short to parent her younger sibelings while singing at a resort to pay the bills, so she has truly payed her dues. <br /> <br />Now that Shania has finally released her Greatest Hits album, you can have all her greatest songs on 1 CD! Admittedly, I could list a whole other CD's worth of great Shania songs which were left off but this is still a mighty strong collection and gives you a good idea of who Shania is as an artist and a person and I would definitily recommend looking into her other albums also. <br /> <br /> <br />Forever and For Always: 10/10 - Lovely, breezy ballad, my favourite Shania song! Beautiful lyrics, excellent melody and Shania shows off great vocal range without going over the top like certain other female artists. <br /> <br />I'm Gonna Getcha Good: 9/10 - The more rock side of Shania! Very sassy, infectious lyrics and great beat...Shania will \\"Getcha Good\\" with this song! <br /> <br />UP!: 9/10 - If this song doesn't Up! your mood then nothing will. <br /> <br />Come On Over: 9/10- Nice unique sound...great beat and an admirable display of Shania's great personality. <br /> <br />Man! I Feel Like A Woman!: 10/10 - One of Shania's trademark songs. Shania just nails it with her attitude and charisma! Great lyrics, great guitar riffs, great guitar solo, great song! <br /> <br />That Don't Impress Me Much: 10/10 - Another of Shania's trademark songs. Great song about what a woman wants in a guy. More then just good looks, cars and all that other fancy crap, it takes something deeper then that to impress Shania! <br /> <br />From This Moment On: 10/10 - Ok, everything about this song is just pure excellence! THE ultimate love song. Epic ballad about true love, almost haunting at how beautiful it is....gorgeous vocals and killer guitar solo! <br /> <br />Honey, I'm Home: 9/10 - The more country side of Shania. Great fiddles and interesting lyrics. <br /> <br />You're Still The One: 10/10 - Another of Shania's trademark songs. Beautiful ballad about beating the odds and true love. <br /> <br />Don't Be Stupid: 9/10 - Great song about trust. Killer beat and awesome fiddles. <br /> <br />Love Gets Me Every Time: 8/10 - Nice song about unexpectedly falling in love. Another display of Shania's country side. <br /> <br />No One Needs To Know: 9/10 - Great country song with catchy lyrics. <br /> <br />You Win My Love: 8/10 - Good song with some nice riffs! <br /> <br />I'm Outta Here: 9/10 - Excellent statement about being in a relationship for love otherwise \\"I'm Outta Here\\"! <br /> <br />The Woman In Me: 10/10 - Really intimate ballad! Magical! <br /> <br />Any Man Of Mine: 10/10 - Shania's breakthrough and arguably best country song, excellent attitude and lyrics! <br /> <br />Whose Bed Have Your Boots: 9/10 - Great tongue in cheek country song about adultery. <br /> <br />Party for Two (with Mark McGrath): 7/10 - Not bad, although I prefere the version with Billy Currington. <br /> <br />Don't!: 9.5/10 - Haunting ballad about forgiveness. <br /> <br/>Party for Two (with Billy Currington): 10/10 - Excellent beat and extremely catchey lyrics! Really fun! <br /> <br />I Ain't No Quitter: 8/10 - One of those songs you'll probably either love or hate. Really country/swing sounding, a real grower.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album deserves to be considered for Album of the Year at the Grammys. This is definitely one of Mariah's best albums and probably her most accessible. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is the perfect example of why Mariah has sold so many records. She's great at writing swank Pop ballads and catchy mid-tempos. \\"We Belong Together\\" is a Mariah Carey classic. And to top it off, she released an infectious remix that's worth the .99 download price. Mariah gives her best on this CD. No way are you getting cheated. She's always been one of the most impressive female vocalists and the \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" merely solidifies what most already knew.
B00000DQSV|5.0|When drummer Roger Talor left Duran Duran after a terrible case of \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" guitarist Andy Taylor quit the band because 1) he was already working on his solo album and 2) he got into a huge fight with bassist John Taylor. So, Simon, Nick, and John got together with Nile Rogers, and he produced the platinum-selling \\"Notorious.\\" The haters were praying that the band was gonna fall apart and flop but they never did. I love those songs \\"Skin Trade,\\" \\"Meet El Presidente,\\" and \\"Notorious,\\" which P.Diddy would use a sample for one of his singles. Wow, even after all this time, Duran Duran are one of the hippest groups around and they cannot be stopped. Just get this classic album now.  <br />
0767827902|5.0|The first book I ever read by Larry McMurtry was \\"The Last Picture Show\\" and it was the reason I ended up reading so many more of his books.  I thought about writing a review of that outstanding book.  However, it's the movie that always comes to mind whenever I try to remember the book.  You see, the movie was just as outstanding as the book, maybe even more so.  It has a tremendous cast and is one of those few movies where the supporting actors took away the Oscars (\\"A Steetcar Named Desire\\" fits that bill as well).  Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shephard, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Ben Johnson all gave excellent preformances in their roles with Leachman and Johnson getting the well-deserved Oscars.  However, it was the directing by Peter Bogdanovich that was the most important contribution to the movie's success. <br /> <br />Bogdanovich wisely chose to make his film seem like it was a contemporary movie of its' time.  The black and white film helped but so did the fact that nothing was made to look cute, quaint, or nostalgic.  We were seeing the present; it just happened to be the 1950's as well.  The cars, the clothes and other odds and ends were of that era but the story and the message were contemporary.  Yet they were spared the excesses of modern cinema so that we could focus on what the director wanted to show us. <br /> <br />\\"The Last Picture Show\\" is about the challenges of growing up.  For the younger characters, they try to grow too fast while the older characters struggle with the realization that the days gone by way outnumber the days to come.  Sam the Lion's soliloquy on growing old ranks right there with Ruth Popper's \\"Why am I always appologizing to you!\\" outburst.  The realism of the pains and joys of life are well captured in this movie that will continue to send a contemporary message to future generations of movie lovers.   <br /> <br />
B00003CXBH|5.0|The year is about 1750. The location is the middle of  South America; in a rain forest in Paraguay. It is Father Gabriel's funeral. The Indians put Father Gabriel's body, strapped  to a cross, in the river and push it over the waterfall. This is the opening scene of the movie, The Mission, a story of colonialization. The movie flashes back to before Father Gabriel's death. Father Gabriel, a Jesuit played by Jeremy Irons, is in the rain forest jungle, playing the flute. The Indians from the Guarini tribe, hearing the flute, come and gather around him. One Indians takes the flute and breaks it. Father Gabriel tries to fix the flute but it can't be repaired. Another Indian, who Captain Rodrigo Mendoza, a slave trader played by Robert De Niro, shoots, is caught in a trap. Father Gabriel gets angry at Rodrigo. Rodrigo brings the Indians into the town. A girl, Carlotta, tells Rodrigo that she loves Felipe, Rodrigo's brother, and this causes Rodrigo to be sad because he loves the girl and angry because the girl he loves loves his brother. The next morning there is a parade and a celebration. Rodrigo comes into Felipe's bedroom and he sees Felipe and the girl in bed. Rodrigo storms out onto the street and Felipe runs after him. The two men fight until Felipe dies when Rodrigo stabs him out of his rage. A few months later, during which time Rodrigo has been in prison, Father Gabriel goes to visit Rodrigo. Father Gabriel tells him he can choose his own penance for his crime of murdering his brother. Rodrigo decides that he will drag a netful of amour and weaponry up a mountain. He does this day after day until when an Indians cuts the rope that tied Rodrigo and the net signaling to Rodrigo that he was being to hard on himself. Father Gabriel gives a book to Rodrigo, from which Rodrigo studies. After a short ceremony in the chapel, Rodrigo is declared an official Jesuit. <br /> Spain and Portugal sign the Treaty of Madrid in which Spain (where slavery has become illegal) has to give some of the Indian land to Portugal (where slavery is legal). In order to keep the Jesuits from being forced out of Portugal, the pope orders the Jesuit missions in South America to be closed. That would mean that the Indians living on the missions would be abandoned and left to be captured by the slave traders. A group of men, one of which is the emissary of the pope, and horses arrive at the mission to share this news with Father Gabriel. There is a meeting in which the future of the Indians is discusses. Rodrigo gets angry at Don Cabesa for what Don says, but the next day Rodrigo apologizes. The emissary starts off on a trip during which he will visit different missions. He sees the Indians working on the plantation farms and carving the musical instruments. One Indian priest tells the emissary that everything at his mission is shared equally in hopes that his mission will be saved. At San Carlos the emissary pronounces that all the Indians must leave the mission. The Indians don't want to and then the emissary says that is God's will for them to go back to the jungle. In response, the Indians say it was God's will that brought them out of the jungle and into the mission in the first place. Although Jesuits take a vow of pacifism, Rodrigo takes the sword when the young Indian boy offers it to him.  Rodrigo knows he is the only one who can teach the Indians to defend themselves. An Indians and Rodrigo steal gunpowder from the sailors. When stealing the gunpowder, one sailor wakes up and begins to yell. To silence him, Rodrigo kills him. Rodrigo asks for Father Gabriel's, who refuses to participate in the actual act of fighting. Father Gabriel gives him his necklace with the cross on it. The Indians and Rodrigo fight the Portuguese in the forest and in canoes in the lake. The Portuguese soldiers siege the town and Rodrigo tries to detonate the cannon-type apparatus he made with the stolen gunpowder but it doesn't explode. Rodrigo is shot and as he is dying he see Father Gabriel walking calmly with the Indians while holding a gold cross. Father Gabriel is shot and falls to the ground and then Rodrigo finally dies. The town is basically destroyed and there is a great scene showing the fiery inferno of the mission and many people, both Portuguese and Indians, being killed. The movie ends with a meeting of the governor and the emissary. The emissary is not sure if he made the right the choice. <br />The governor says, \\"Your eminence, thus is the world.\\" <br />The emissary replies \\" No, thus we made the world.\\" <br />The closing dialogue displays one of the messages of the movie- the destruction that colonialism and the slave trade caused. <br />

I really don't see it, He might have a reason for the new seens or music, I can't say, but 1 and 2 are the first ones I've seen and I thought they were the best I wouldn't be a fan if I didn't like it, these movies come out of the mind of George Lucas what right do the fan's have to act like we own them movie? George Lucas rocks!!  <br />ps: ROTS was worth sitting in line for an hour
0062502182|2.0|... Hey, nothing happened!<br />That is the conundrum afflicting the modern classic The Alchemist: A Fable About Following Your Dream by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho. Having travelled through much of the area in which the book's main character wanders and having gone through personal daze, trauma, tribulation, and drug-related unrestraint in the '70s, Coelho himself has undergone a transformation into a modern guru to the masses. Although materialism is oddly still alive and well with him given his need to cite celebrity readers, flaunting a mansion or demonstrating his bow and arrow technique on national TV. Perhaps that is his Personal Legend, who knows?<br />In the book we learn about the aforementioned Personal Legend, Language Of The World, Soul Of The World and (subtly) about the jurisdiction of Jesus Christ. On a positive note though Coelho advocates activity, happiness and swift action in order to realize one's proverbial treasure. The problem is that the plot and the outcome are never in doubt. The end is predictable and the universe is presented under the guise of a distorted language of inevitably. Taking action means a content character, aversion of disaster and much pretension. Only were we to act upon the superstition and supposition that The Alchemist endorses, that is. Alas, the problem is that readers are asked to believe things which are not borne by our lives. Can a shepherd boy miraculously read the omens of the earth, skies and the universe? Can a poor man get transformed into a mystic dervish of the desert if he follows his dreams? Can the hawks foretell the balance of things terrestrial and the coming chaos of universe? If the happiness is where the heart is, why can the heart not alter its course? Is hubris not the biggest sin? Do different enlightened minds really utter the same words of wisdom wherever one goes and do these sages really exist? Why is a camel \\"traitorous\\" if it has spent its life serving man, but eventually has to die? Does that not make the rider the traitor for his ungratefulness?<br />The Alchemist is a fable of paradoxes. The author has no qualms in presenting his self-defeating ironies as truth of the cosmos - much like organized religion. In that context, this book will appeal to the simple-minded, the religious and to a mainstream populace which finds much comfort in receiving simple answers to complex questions.<br />As far as omens in books go though, reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is probably a much more lucid choice.t make the rider the traitor for his ungratefulness?

0385512058|4.0|A review of a book is meant to be an opinion.  Something that others can reference to find a comparison point and understand better whether they are appropriately interested in a text or manuscript - and subsequently how much value they may place on it within the context of their own lives. <br /> <br />I will provide these items to note:   I read first through the negative critiques of Keith's book, I continued to scan quickly through the positive ones - to which I give limited weight.  An important first step to understand whether the book is really valuable or not.  I then proceeded to evaluate the book from an image/impression point of view.  Lastly, I read and evaluated whether the book might have value in my life as a professional.  Not in the life of others.  Not in the life of similar people.  In my life.  Is it valuable to me.  This is what I came up with: <br /> <br />Opines of the naysayers: <br />Many of the critiques (there were many - which usually makes for at least a marketable, controversial piece of literature) were overloaded with negative connotations about 'manipulation', 'deception', 'dishonesty', and 'insincerity' with the processes used by Keith to acquire friends, and take advantage of these friends and their relationships.  Several reviewers also go out of their way to show how he drops names everywhere and glorifies himself and 'toots' his own horn throughout his book.. <br /> <br />My first guess is that most of those who are commenting in this way do NOT have the same level of connectivity that Keith has established through many years of building a network.  That said, what Keith has done implements applying these name drops to actual experiences where dropping names can be of value. <br /> <br />Think about it objectively - would you attend a party where you know there would be wealthy billionaires attending or one where you can meet with typical professionals in your field who you have little knowledge of whether they are successful.Yes, I'm sure there's some humility involved in this process.  Keith touched on that a few times in his book - including his efforts to consider respect for all levels of individuals (you really don't know who they know).  This includes his comments about learning from his past mistakes as he shot up through the ranks.  But human beings are social animals.  There is a pecking order in life (even if you don't believe it).  There are people who live life more fully (not necessarily financially) and those who live it less so than you. <br /> <br />Most importantly, as a reader you must be able to sift that material out of the picture.  Keith uses it to depict a point or concept, not only to glorify himself.  And even if he does, does it really matter?  You are seeking to determine whether you will use his techniques to modify your lifestyle and adopt one where friendships are also business-related and vice-versa.  In most of his book, he also adds that he is expected to provide the same for others.  Just because he asked a friend to help him out and move him further along the success curve or happiness curve doesn't mean that he has done anything wrong.  Keith supports this with his variation of 'pay it forward' and 'reciprocity' where he expects others to ask the same of him - in which case he would submit appropriately. <br /> <br />I must admit, some of the stars that Keith hangs out with - however briefly - are truly spectacular movers and shakers.  With that comes a bit of caution, as we all know the tendency for a definite increase in the nose gradient as people begin to associate with top dogs of the world.  But in Keith's case, he has earned that right by moving through the ranks of truly effective firms and reaching the stardom through hard work and perseverance (and in many cases, networking). <br /> <br />Ultimately, the naysayers have neglected to consider that the world is built of social structures and every situation has political motives so long as complete trust is not delivered and accepted by all parties involved.  Keith's concepts prove to be a great way to increase the trust levels required to build strong forthcoming relationships that don't 'wither on the vine' but are recirculated and built into powerful abilities for accomplishment however great or small. <br /> <br />Most of the naysayers have the wrong reasons for criticizing - they attack him personally and not the content of his book for whatever reasons.  Certainly criticizing him for self-aggrandizement cannot be considered that much out of line, as all he's doing is supporting his processes, thoughts, and perhaps his personal business through his book.  However, he has no obligations at all to share his experiences with the public, and by doing so, opens himself up to more than just criticism. <br /> <br />Moving onward to the next topic - the image/impression of the book. <br /> <br />I was amazed at the fluorescent orange cover with some strange words about eating on it.  At first I would have no clue this book was about networking (which I believe many of the first people to spot the book had a difficult time anyway).  But then I saw that it relates closely to FedEx's branding strategy with their color coordination, and even the 'XXX for dummies' line of books.  It stands out from the rest of the pack based on the color coordination.  Given that the book relates to personal branding and marketing of oneself for moving forward in corporate circles, it wouldn't be thrown out as an outcast. <br /> <br />The image of the book can be summarized to me as the following: <br />Building Shareholder Value in You - in a highly adventurous manner.  The least I would call it would be conservative.  Some of his techniques require lifestyle changes.  Some of his methods are radical.  <br /> <br />Last topic - The book. <br /> <br />There are successful people who do NOT use Ferrazzi's methods to achieve success.  There are also individuals who avoid relationships altogether, yet still are able to accomplish their aims in achieving happiness, financial freedom, and significant life accomplishments.  However, 'Never Eat Alone' touches on one aspect of achieving success through the building of relationships and the empowerment of others to help you.  Does this mean you are taking advantage of others?  Does this mean you are establishing an inequitable relationship?  Does this mean you are being dishonest or unethical? <br /> <br />For me, business has always been a 2-way street.  Keith stresses this point throughout his book.  He goes back to the classic adages of the past such as 'do unto others...', and 'you have to give to get', et. al.  He puts them together and shows how when applied, they really have value - because ultimately that's how social structures are built.  They have time-tested foundations of common knowledge, that not everyone has accepted or can accept.  For me, his techniques were preaching to the choir.  However, his book is great for those who have yet to believe it and can see true effects from their conditions of helping others out.  He does not condone opportunism (at least not unethical opportunism) however, he does support business sense.  In all transactions you have a buyer and seller, and in networking, you have the same.  Except, just as it was ages ago, you are bartering, not buying with currency.  What you barter is information primarily, but also other things such as emotional empathy.  For instance when you call up your contact on their birthday to let them know, you have made a significant exchange of emotional empathy - showing you care.  Even if you have some ideas in mind of what you'd like to get from your friend in the future - maybe a business reference, or a possible job contact, or maybe admission to a country club.  Keith stresses that your gift, trade, exchange, whatever, has to be given in good faith.  You have to mean what you say/do with genuineness and sincerity.  This aspect of his technique justifies the methodology (and in many cases anything else will immediately negate the value of what you contribute to a relationship) <br /> <br />Ultimately, the book was a refresher course in mixing with people, both high and low in status.  It provides some great tips on how to address specific situations, and the value of face-to-face as opposed to single channels of communication.  It stresses the importance of relationships - although it may not apply in all circumstances.  And lastly, was an easy read in story format.  Some of these things - for salespeople or marketing folks - should be inherent to their nature. <br /> <br />Other items, like the name droppings, well, that's for show.  If you can read through show, then maybe you can understand the wealth of information underneath. <br /> <br />Just my humble opinion. <br /> <br />As a side note and disclaimer: I have had the fortune of meeting Keith, and from my limited impression, he does believe and follow his scriptures.
B00009V7P8|1.0|If you are an american, you will not like this music. <br /> <br />Do not listen to anybody who says this music is good.   <br /> <br />Rice can't sing.  A previous poster said that his 'human imperfections' unwravel Rice's soul and add character to his words.  Don't believe it.  Rice can't sing, and it's not cute or admirable that he tries to sing and wears his soul on his sleeve even though he can't sing.   <br /> <br />Damien Rice can't hold a candle to Dave Matthews, or to Leanard Cohen.  'Suzanne' is a classic, and \\"A blower's Daughter\\" is a cacauphanous, jumbled, out-of-tune, unmelodic, vomit of a song. <br /> <br />I wasted my money on this CD, don't you do the same.
B000005JA8|1.0|Intriguing?  No, not really.  Daring?  I guess it is in the same way that taking a dump in the middle of Times Square is daring.  Listen to any of the samples for yourself.  Believe me, that should be more than enough to help you make up your mind.  If you're not so absolutely fed up with conventional music that you want to throw a grenade at your stereo, if you don't believe that every once in a great while melody and harmony and skillful yet plain singing and playing count for anything at all in pop music, then go ahead and buy this.  It was made just for you.  You'll love this assault on the conventional.  But if that doesn't describe you, if you can appreciate anything between Bach and Public Enemy, between the Sex Pistols and Britney Spears, then beware.  This album falls way outside those boundries.  My honest opinion?  I can imagine more melodious naval battles.  I've heard better harmony from lawnmower engines and beehives.  And I've heard more nuanced singing from parakeets or even during the worst American Idol auditions.  This is the musical equivalent of \\"Attack of the 50-foot Woman,\\" \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" or \\"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\\"  Yes, they were all made intentionally, too. So, by all means, enjoy.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I found this soundtrack in the Navajo sandstone of Utah's senic Arches National Park, and I was plesantly surprised. All the tracks were simply fantabulous, except for number four, which reminded me of the Indian National anthem \\"Vande Maharam.\\" But other than that, I listened to this soundtrack at least four times a day, and some times I do a little dance to it. I assure you it's really great, and if Mr.Hans Zimmer saw it, I'm sure he would be proud, and invite me to join his company, Media Ventures, and thence be the companies offcial interpretive dancer. <br /> <br />It's not every day I have this reaction to a soundtrack.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|Matt Stone and Trey Parker are low brow comedy geniuses.  South Park is still one of the funniest shows on TV and thier movies are almost always hilarious.  This movie is no exception.  TA kind of gets off to a slow start, but towards the end it is a laugh a minute.  Even the bonus stuff on here is very funny.  The deleted scenes and animated story boards are good because they show some funny stuff they left out of the final film (\\"Five month olds!?!\\").  Even the puppet tests are funny. <br /> <br />All hail Matt Stone and Trey Parker, kings of toilet humor!

B00000K501|5.0|Okay, I was hung-ho to purchase the CD version until I read the amazon review about the difference between the CD and the original VHS tape - they had cut out Buck Dich from the CD version because of an alleged SM Homosexual Rape scene that did not please our 'higher society' Decency Patrol who determines what we sheepish tax-paying citizens should view and not view, the puritanical and un-adulterated delicate flower pedals that we are. As a Rammstein fan, and an educated adult not stranded in church, naturally curiosity got the better of me and I had to buy the VHS tape instead and witness the aweful rudeness for myself. I don't like being jipped of my hard-earned money either, so the tape was the accurate option for me anyway. Well... I'll be damned! Cursed be oh gaga thee, what moron deemed that particular spectacle a horrid rape scene to be banished from society is truly an idiot and should cancel their HBO subscription, head for the hills right away and hang his/herself from the tallest tree. Because if that scene made 'em reach for their good book, wait til they see what's on ordinary TV next season. Get a grip people. It is a spectacle alright, and I laughed myself silly when the scene came up, but it's nothing of the sort of a \\"rape\\" scene (I'll even admit I was a tad wee dissappointed there wasn't more to it from all the hipe than the 30 some seconds of mere sexual 'gesture'). I knew there wouldn't be anything harsh to it already, even German audiences (who are apparently ions more open-minded than our government gives us credit for) have their limits and Rammstein is no fools, they're not going to alienate their diverse audience with truly crude stuff. This ain't porn after all. Rammstein is known for their spectacular shows, and unlike most bands they're not afraid to venture beyond mere love and loss themes in their songs, duh. But that's the beauty of Rammstein, and it's not like they gear their shows, or their music for that matter, for the lite-hearted. They're geared for us, the rest of the vast population of adults who have been around the block, and those who haven't yet but are clearly geared to no matter what anybody says. If you intend to pamper us in 'decency', then stop showing Sadam in his underwear already and put Jerry F back on prime time to show us the righteous way to salvation!!! In my opinion, their playful and non-threatening momentary stage venture into the world of Gay SM sex (which is no more depraved than anything heteros reckon doing on HBO on a nightly basis), and no penetration involved blessed be between the lead with a plastic dildo spewing vast amounts of white liquid throughout the audience as well and the keyboardist on a leash and his pretty little glutus maximus exposed briefly (hey, the audience cheered on, they were not offended), is a play in comedy and hardly a reason to omit Buck Dich, which they executed as beautifully musically as the rest of their performance here and to omit it takes away from the entire performance. Shame on the decency patrol who denied this segment from the CD version, and to save whom from stumbling down the path of sadomasochistic depravity and shooting up a McDonalds? I mean, really folks. What a joke. Even if you're offended by minutely sexual displays, and if you are do cancel your Showtime subscription as well, forget buying the CD version - act on your freedom (and morbid curiosity) to choose what you do and watch and go for the VHS full version, you won't be sorry. Even if you don't like this particular display of comedy, the tape is already a collector's item and will one day be entirely unavailable but to those who can afford paying a hefty price.
6304698623|4.0|The first time I saw this movie was when I was about four or five. It was my first ever cry movie, and I have been wanting to watch it again and again, though I have not seen it since I was nine. Sadly, 'A Little Princess' was not on my mind for several years. <br /> <br />Recently, I was assigned to read a classic novel for school, and by some ironic choice, I picked 'A Little Princess' by Francis Hodgson Burnett. The book awakened the memory of my favorite childhood movie, along with the release of Alfonso Cuaron's direction of the third Harry Potter film.  <br /> <br />This movie will never be as good as the original book, and rather than say 'based' upon the novel, it was more 'inspired with many similar portions as the novel.' However, by itself, 'A Little Princess' is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I highly recommend it to any sentimentalist out there who wants to see a very well put together movie.  <br /> <br />If only I could put four and a half stars, because while it should be degraded for not staying true to the classic novel, it still is something to always treasure.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I really love this series. The writing is well done. I can't wait until season 4 comes out!
B000006MS3|3.0|Kate Bush's \\"The Dreaming\\" is often hailed as her masterwork by many of her fans-- it is certainly her most unique, varied, and in many ways passionately performed, although it is a bit uneven to my ears.   Certainly, it is Bush's darkest album. <br /> <br />One of the points that can easily be made about the album is that when its good, its brilliant-- take \\"Pull Out the Pin\\", Bush's vocal is infused with passion as it neatly rambles over the wandering piano and bass and is nicely grounded by a deep male vocal (courtesy of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour).  Or the disjoint and amazing \\"Night of the Swallow\\", again, really beyond words to describe.   The album closes particularly strongly, with the delicate \\"Houdini\\" and the bizarre and powerful \\"Get Out of My House\\" <br /> <br />But the album is one of dark moods, and it really hurts the overall quality of the album, with pieces such as \\"There Goes a Tenner\\" and \\"The Dreaming\\" being largely uninteresting compared to the rest of the material and some otherwise fine material (\\"Leave It Open\\", \\"All the Love\\") getting lost in the shuffle. <br /> <br />Not a good place to start, this album is rewarding in its own way, but but it definitely shouldn't be the first Kate Bush album anyone hears-- start with \\"Never For Ever\\" or \\"Hounds of Love\\".
B000056C6L|3.0|Originally released in 1973, looks to be Gong's fifth lp that was produced by Giorgio Gomelsky (Yardbirds, Brian Auger). Call me ignorant if you wish, but for some reason(s) I've just never been able to get all -that- much into this classic Gong catalog title. I do like the other two lp's they put out in the same two year period, 'Angel Egg' and 'You' very much so. This CD reissue's title 12-minute cut, \\"Flying Teapot\\" and \\"Zero The Hero And The Witch's Spell\\" are probably the best tracks here. 'The Flying Teapot' is certainly considered to be a '70's cosmic rock staple. Nice reissue job on this Japanese label. Memorable cover.
B000007MVL|2.0|Kate Bush's second album, \\"Lionheart\\", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing \\"The Kick Inside Part Two\\", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so. <br /> <br />Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (\\"In Search of Peter Pan\\", \\"In the Warm Room\\"), a more pop structure (\\"Wow\\"), rhythmic shifts (\\"Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake\\") an almost shuffle (\\"Fullhouse\\") and a gret rock song (\\"Hammer Horror\\").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (\\"Symphony in Blue\\") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (\\"Kashka from Baghdad\\"). <br /> <br />The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing \\"Kashka from Baghdad\\" can be all that bad, and certainly \\"Symphony in Blue\\" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (\\"The Kick Inside\\") or the stunning \\"Never For Ever\\".
B00004SVID|4.0|Review no. 128. Good sounding 2-CD archive release of one of rock's most ever desired tour. Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'. As some of you might remember, Floyd played something like four (4) U.S. dates for this double-lp's tour, because of it's high cost to move the show from town to town in early 1980. I had a chance to catch the first concert in New York, but didn't have the money. Talk about a regret that took time to get over. 'Is There...' is pretty much the SAME tracks in the same running order than the 2-lp 'The Wall' is. Only difference, is of course the entire 95-minute show is in front of a huge audience. So, you get to fully experience cuts like \\"In The Flesh?\\", \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 1\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" once again. Wear the headphones while played these two disc. You won't be sorry. Comes with two extremely cool CD booklets packed with informative text and full color photos. A should-have.
B000006U44|4.0|One of the most brilliant and mature debut albums in the history of pop music, Kate Bush's \\"The Kick Inside\\" is stunning, especially given that she was only 20 when this was released.  What makes it even more remarkable is that as good as this is, this is far from the best work she did. <br /> <br />Vocally, the influence Bush had through this album on woman singers a generation later (i.e. Tori Amos, P.J. Harvey, Sarah McLaughlin, Happy Rhodes) is certainly noticable-- with her girly vocals floating gently above piano-driven ballads and bizarre near swinging rock songs, the path to alternative/female vocal music so prevelent in the mid-90s is clear.  It may be the case that her voice is somewhat hard to deal with-- remembeing she was 20, and her vocal does occasionally get a bit, for lack of better word, shrill.  Still, this remarkably doesn't get in the way of the music. <br /> <br />The album is at its best with its ballads, Bush seems to have a more self-assured confidence in her voice on powerful opener \\"Moving\\", the stunning \\"The Man With the Child in His Eyes\\" and \\"L'amour Looks Something Like You\\".  Its largely the more energetic pieces where vocally she becomes less focusewd (\\"Kite\\", the otherwise excellent \\"James and the Cold Gun\\").  And of course there's the album's hit, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", a musical interpretation of Emily Bronte's piece that soars, bubbles and was deserving of its success. <br /> <br />Bush would do better albums-- \\"Never For Ever\\" took the sounds of this record to a level of full maturity, \\"The Dreaming\\" is bizarre and brilliant, and \\"Hounds of Love\\" shows Bush at the peak of her powers and maturity, but in many ways, this is the best place to start exploring Bush's music.  Recommended.
B00008972S|5.0|It's too bad that younger generations of viewers of WEST SIDE STORY, when viewing the scenes of superb ensemble choreography will at once think of certain fashionable brands of chinos. In our society, where nothing is sacred, it's a shame that our most elevated moments of artistic achievement end up being shanghaid for commercial exploitation.<BR>    That aside, WEST SIDE STORY has it all. A love story with a timeless and universal appeal. A pulsating energy from beginning to end. A fantastic libretto and Leonard Bernstein's outstanding score, with performances to match. Brilliant cinematography that captures the flavour of NYC circa 1960 with its decaying neighbourhoods and smoldering juvenile gang tension. It really is a climax to such worthy precursors as &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; of 1955.<BR>     WEST SIDE STORY also features some fine acting performances, although curiously not from the leads. The Supporting Oscars bestowed on Rita Moreno and George Chakiris were well deserved as it was they who supplied the Latino passion in spades. Natalie Wood looks gorgeous as usual but uses her eyes rather than her body to express her emotions, which is not very Puerto Rican at all. Richard Beymer is rather wooden and there is a lack of chemistry between him and Natalie. Not surprising, considering that Ms Wood was not pleased with his selection to play opposite her and subsequently gave him the cold shoulder throughout the production.<BR>   What really energates WEST SIDE STORY is the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins. From the long opening gang ballet scene to it's tragic but inevitable ending, this film never lags. Much more than a Musical, this masterpiece satisfies all the senses and it remains unsurpassed in its achievement.
B000002U9E|5.0|While its a term that is often misused, \\"Hounds of Love\\" is an album that shows Kate Bush as a mature artist-- this is not to imply lifeless or without edge, as this usually means, but rather that Bush has fully come into her own as a performer, providing an album performed with confidence, full arrangement, and cleverness.  Lyrically, it is her best imagery, at times her most distant and yet her most personal, and her vocal delivery lacks any sort of harshness that could sometimes be present in the past.    Back in the days of vinyl, this was a two-sided album in the truest sense, the first side titled \\"Hounds of Love\\", the second \\"The Ninth Wave\\".  The latter is apparently some sort of concept story about a woman drowning, but its quite honestly pretty loose.    The first side is filled with mid-tempo pieces-- Bush has reached a state of fully realized pop, with the fantastic \\"Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)\\", the title track, and \\"Cloudbusting\\".  Perhaps the highlight of all of these is the fantastic arrangement and superb confident vocals from Bush.  Drastically different is \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\", featuring a fantastic vocal and superlative bass playing, but somewhat marred by an obnoxious breaking glass sample.  I've always found \\"The Big Sky\\" unfortunately to be a bit too pop for me, its a reasonable song, but what it does, other pieces on this one do better.    The second side is puncuated by much sparser arrangements, the result being that Bush's voice really gets a chance to shine on pieces like \\"Under Ice\\", where her vocal floats above dark strings and the stunning \\"Jig of Life\\".  But really the entire side of the album is a long highlight and rather brilliant, barring the somewhat annoying \\"Waking the Witch\\" and \\"Watching You Without Me\\", where samples and overproduction get in the way of otherwise fantastic pieces.    Small flaws aside, this is likely the best of Bush's work and a superb place to begin looking at her work, highly recommended.
B00005N919|4.0|Baisc Instinct, directed by controversial director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Total Recall) is a very erotic film that would have passed off as the most controversial film ever. In my opinion, it is. This unrated director's cut is the exact same shown in Europe (The R-rated version is the American version, which features less stabbing, blood, and explicit sex) This version adds about one minute of explicit footage, inculding 4 extra stabs in the Johnny Boz murder and longer, uncut sex scenes (especally between Michael Douglas and Jeanne Tripplehorn, and Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone) and the murder of Gus has more blood, gore and 3 extra stabs. Well, that's about it.  <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 7/10
B00000DQSS|5.0|Often overshadowed by what came after it, \\"Never For Ever\\" is the missed gem in Kate Bush's catalog-- while it lacks the careful construction of \\"The Dreaming\\" and \\"Hounds of Love\\" and the freshness of \\"The Kick Inside\\", it has a balance between these elements that Bush never quite captured similarly. <br /> <br />\\"Never For Ever\\" is also in many ways the end of a chapter in Bush's career, the girlish vocals of the earlier material is delivered now with a self-assurance that allows it to carry past its unusual timber and register.  The forms on the first two records, primarily ballads and off-kilter pop songs, are perfected here. Take \\"The Infant Kiss\\"-- inspired by a movie Bush had seen, develops as a powerful, unnerving, and jarring ballad of such strength and power that it threatens to overwhelm the listener.  The album moves very far past the ballad form, from explosive pop (\\"Babooshka\\"), dark and mysterious moods (\\"Delius\\", \\"Egypt\\") to the absolutely bizarre (the nearly indescribable \\"The Wedding List\\").  The album closes on a dark and haunted mode, with both the delicate \\"Army Dreamers\\" and \\"Breathing\\" showing how powerful of a vocalist Bush can be. <br /> <br />Admittedly, there are a couple misfires-- \\"Blow Away\\" isn't particularly interesting, and \\"Violin\\" just doesn't really work, but the album itself is fantastic and essential.  If you're a fan of Bush's followers, this might be the best place to start, it certainly is one of her best.  Highly recommended.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|Patrick Marber, the author of the play by the same name wrote the screenplay for Mike Nichols' screen adaption so I assume he's happy with this production. First, Mike Nichols continues to give us one fine movie after another-- from his first THE GRADUATE to his most recent ANGELS IN AMERICA. This film is no exception and is wonderfully filmed-- there are lots of closeups of the characters that we expect from Nichols and certainly appropriate here since the movie essentially is about four individuals who do an awful lot of talking-- when they aren't changing partners and bedrooms. The acting is superb: Julia Roberts as Anna, Jude Law as Dan, Nathalie Portman as Alice and Clive Owen as Larry give tremendous performances. These are beautiful people who are selfish and nasty to everyone they should care about most, i.e., their spouses and/or lovers.<br /><br />A friend of mine used to say that he didn't care for either fiction or movies if he couldn't like any of the characters. Using that criterion, this movie falls on its face. On the other hand, if you want to see people acting very badly and completely self-centered, then you'll find this movie to your liking.<br /><br />Alice says it all in a scene near the end of the movie when she finally kicks Dan out of her life, saying something to the effect that he didn't have to be cruel to her by being unfaithful and sleeping with Anna, that all of us should realize that there's a line we shouldn't cross in order to prevent hurting someone we love. With the possible exception of Anna, these people will do whatever it takes to get what they think they want and have no interest in staying within boundries.<br /><br />A dark, well acted, well directed movie.
B000002NJS|5.0|'Ray of Light' marked Madonna's return to pop glory.  She was still a successful and beloved international pop star in 1998, but both 'Erotica' and 'Bedtime Stories' did not deliver the same numbers as blockbusters like 'True Blue' and 'Like a Prayer'.  <br /> <br />'Ray of Light' changed that.  Not only was it a huge hit for Madonna, it was her most consistent and enjoyable album yet, and it gained raves from both critics and record-buyers alike (not to mention the Grammys).  <br /> <br />There is a wealth of great material on this album, including the stunning opener, 'Drowned World/Substitute for Love', the frenetic title track, and the haunting 'Skin'.   <br /> <br />William Orbit proved to be an excellent producer fro Madonna, and although he would produce a few tracks on ROL's follow-up, 'Music', I think Madonna ended her partnership with him a little too quickly.   <br /> <br />Their collaboration marked a watershed in Madonna's career, and a reminder that Madonna could deliver an album that was both commercial and soulful.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I won't repeat what everyone else says here in the negative reviews, with much of which I agree, expecially about scene selection. I'll just say that I wasn't expecting to be incredibly impressed, I had already read the book several times and I thought the scenes which they chose to transfer to film were fairly well acted and the spirit of the book was fairly well captured. I think the overarching difficulty with these HP movies is that they're rushing them into production to ride the initial hype.<br /><br />Let's face it - there weren't any studios back in the 40's that were breaking down doors to sign deals to film Tolkien's work which was being written at the time. Then feeble attempts were made by animators to capture the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in one regular-length animated feature. Not until Peter Jackson recently spent years producing 9.5 or so hours worth of screen time had justice been done to the popular fantasy.<br /><br />But they are rushing these movies into production, producing them virtually simultaneously with the writing of the books. The Harry Potter series has arguably more character development and dialogue than Lord of the Rings and thus requires more meticulous attention to scene selection to fit in to an average length movie. In a story like POA the film-makers are necessarily going to leave out huge gaps either in the class time, the Quidditch scenes or the long amounts of dialogue at the climax when they discover the true identity of Pettigrew and Black. This last part is the one I feel suffers the most although I think the time-turner experience is very well done.<br /><br />They simply have too much material to translate with \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and it's only going to get harder with the next 2 films. Personally I would have enjoyed POA broken into 2 films much better or even a 3 hour movie, but that would be a harder sell for sure, especially for a \\"kid's movie\\".

B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is one of Dire Straits' all-time best CDs ever!! It is my <br />favorite CD to listen to in the car. I think Mark Knopfler does <br />Tunnel of Love very well and it is one of my favorite Dire Straits songs of all time and is a track that I can listen to over N' over again. Other than that my other favorites would be <br />Romeo and Juliet, Skateaway, Expresso Love, & Solid Rock. Dire Straits are definately the best band on the planet. In my opinion, Les Boys is the weakest song on the whole planet! I also <br />reccomend Love over Gold, & On Every Street in addition to this <br />album. Now I'll review all the songs on this great rock album. <br /> <br />Tunnel of Love 11/10, Like I said before, I think Mark Knopfler <br />does this song very well and this is one of my favorite songs on <br />this album, and is a track that I can listen to over N' over again. Great song! <br /> <br />Romeo and Juliet 9/10, It is known as a lovesong! It is kinda <br />a little too slow for me though I like it. <br /> <br />Skateaway 10/10, One of their best songs ever! I think Mark Knopfler sings this song very well and this song rocks you! I love the ending!  <br /> <br />Expresso Love 9/10, Very good song! I almost like this one as much as Tunnel of Love and Skateaway.  <br /> <br />Hand in Hand 5/10, This song's okay but not my favorite. <br /> <br />Solid Rock 9/10, One of my favorites on this album. I like how <br />Mark Knopfler sings \\"I'm gonna live on a soliiiiiiiiiid rock\\".  <br />The lyrics are funny and the music it will make you laugh. Great <br />song. <br /> <br />Les Boys 0/10 Skip it, this is the dumbest Dire Straits song of all time! The lyrics are stupid and the musics just as dumb as <br />the lyrics. Oh well. <br /> <br />Best album ever, <br />go out and buy it today with my advice here. <br />LOVE OVER GOLD <br />ON EVERY STREET <br /> <br />Thank you very much and I hope you buy it because <br />it will grow on you. <br /> <br />\\"Telegraph Road\\"

0671510991|4.0|Diplomacy is the governmental profession that decides and determines the fate of multitudes. Intense and highly cerebral, this complex craft is given a skilled and ample history by controversial former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He relates in eloquent and learned prose the story of the West's inter-national relations from the 17th-Century to the end of the Cold War, and it's impact on the world around it. The book is centered around the United States' unique handling of Foreign Affairs - it's style and outlook towards dealing with it's European and worldwide neighbors. The work starts off with the author's analysis of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, whom to the author are the benchmarks of American Foreign Policy - the hands-on practicality of the former, and the idealistic morality-centredness of the latter. Kissinger then moves to the European realm, narrating in fixating style the \\"raison d'etat\\" of Richelieu, and the \\"Realpolitik\\" of Bismarck, the two seminal influences of Western diplomacy. I admired the brilliance of these two great statesmen, as theire work were not only outstanding, but groundbreaking. Richelieu broke from the theological dogma which hampered Diplomacy of his time, introducing a system which permitted the alliances of recognized enemies and non-allies to maintain the balance-of-power. Bismarck innovated the \\"overlapping\\" approach to national relations: a pattern of creating multiple ties to avoid conflict, rather than confront it. These two methods have been the orders that Western Diplomacy have followed since.<br /><br />The author also touches on fascinating topics that charted the course of Western Diplomacy, and hence it's history: The Peace of Westphalia; The Congress of Vienna; the events leading to the First World War; Versailles; Munich; The Cold War; Suez; Cuba; Vietnam; the post-Cold War aftermath and it's repercussions today. In the final chapter of the book, \\"The New World Order Reconsidered\\", Kissinger makes sound and impressive analysis' on the new challenge America faces at a different global situation, offering deft advice by summarizing the lessons learned from history.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read on Political Science, and it's a catcher. Long and slightly tedious, it nontheless is a grand and epic sweep on this fascinating subject expertly written by an erudite hand who knows his artform well. It has inspired me to look further into the subject and has turned me into a life-long political student.\\", Kissinger makes sound and impressive analysis' on the new challenge America faces at a different global situation, offering deft advice by summarizing the lessons learned from history.

B0000029DD|5.0|I learned about Buckley through a recommendation from a friend.  I was disappointed on first listening to songs like Lover, You Should've Come Over and Last Goodbye, but was hooked instantly by the beautiful Hallelujah.  Buckley is almost whispering and you can even hear his breath, and it sounds fantastic.  After a few more listens, while Hallelujah started to lose interest, I started to appreciate the other songs more.  I started to notice how perfect the choice of the chords was, as for example in Lover under the line of \\"maybe I'm too young...\\", and the vocal segments where Buckley seemed to float without direction suddenly seemed to have direction.    This seems to be an album where the greatness stays hidden for a while and then suddenly jumps out at you.  I recommend buying this album and, if it doesn't hit you in the first couple of listens, try listening to it on different speakers, even crappy ones, or with slightly different equalization.  But buying the album would be a very good place to start.

Less choice means more sales.  The face is an enormously rich source of emotion.  Every blink is a series of discrete moving parts. <br /> <br />Music auditions are thin slicing moments.  The use of screens, blind auditions, has changed the composition of orchestras.   <br /> <br />The notes at the end of the book are of great interest.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I just can't believe how overrated this thing is! This movie was WAY TOO hyped up and given praise for what I don't know. It was very much undeserving of the numerous awards it won, and all the money that it made. If anyone is stupid enought to sweat a movie like it is the best thing that ever touched this earth when it is simply okay then that means there is something wrong with this world. (I was so happy when reading some editor's view in Parade Magazine that he thought it was embarrassing that it won 11 academy awards and that there are so many other movies out there that were good and better than this piece of garbage, but failed to get the attention that this nonsense got.)That DiCaprio guy is so overrated! That idiot is nothing.I don't know why I am the only one that thinks this. The movie was not all that touching, heart-breaking, and awesome like the media make it out to be. Please! Are people for real?!!!!!!! Go watch soap operas instead.
B000002AGN|5.0|I remember my excitement when, 46 years ago, I first heard Joe Morello's drum riff intro to Take Five. \\"What the heck?!\\" I thought. With its 5/4 time signature, it was so odd, yet so cool. And that amazing drum solo, with its use of space. I played drums along with that album countless times, trying to play that triplet on beat 5 of Take Five as smoothly as Morello tossed it off. <br /> <br />For many listeners, part of the appeal of this album comes from experiencing the group in live performances. I saw the Quartet in Cleveland's Music Carnival. Such joy they brought to the audience! It was raining that day. When the group played \\"Pennies from Heaven,\\" Gene Wright looked skyward and grimaced. I talked with Joe Morello along with a swarm of other young drummers surrounding him after the concert. He was delighted to share all he knew. <br /> <br />Back to the record, Paul Desmond was famous for his velvety sax tone and graceful musical lines. But he also did amazing things rhythmically which are revealed on close listening. <br /> <br />Strange Meadow Lark starts as a lovely ballad for solo piano, then moves along effortlessly at a medium tempo as the other members join in. The piece closes as it started, serene as a sunset. <br /> <br />Kathy's Waltz was named after Dave's daughter Cathy, but was misspelled on the liner notes. What's remarkable in this tune  (and in Strange Meadow Lark) is the mood of bliss: so relaxed, not a care, all is right with the world. No wonder people love this record. <br /> <br />Blue Rondo a la Turk contrasts a regimented uptight rhythm with a loose, free jazz feel. Two opposite attitudes coexisting in the same song. You can feel the tension release when the rhythms change. <br /> <br />Many albums later, Brubeck and otherwise, I fully appreciate the Quartet for getting me excited about jazz. Thanks, Dave and friends for a lifetime of musical enjoyment.
B0007P3582|4.0|The best songs are \\"candy shop\\", \\"just a little bit\\", and \\"i'm gonna die tonight\\". I have not listened the whole cd, and to be honest, I really don't care to, but I am giving it a 4 because it seems alright. I really like that song \\"die tonight\\"! This song is tight! It sounds like this hard-hitting, serious premonition that something is going to go down big time like a hit killing that you would see in those mafia type movies. Though it's not a good or pleasant thought, the music and beats to the song sounds really GOOD while picturing the morbid. The only thing I can't stand is how 50 keeps on talking about Ja Rule and then goes after those that associates with him. Why is he beefing so hard with him? He needs to get a life, seriously. I think there are some deeper issues that he has that extends WAY Beyond his rant of his \\"soft\\" rap style. Somewhere down the line, this man really resents Ja, it seems, because maybe he probably snubbed (dissed) him like he was nothing. And he still hasn't gotten over it so he continues to make insults to him, and it's so unnecessary. (I heard on the entertainment news on the radio that 50 really doesn't like him because when they were coming up in the same neighborhood, he never said anything to him or acknowledged him). Poor thing, 50 is really hurting over Ja not paying him any mind that behaves like a little child who was wronged and injured. Oh, my way. Anyway, sorry for getting off subject. I hope my review helped.
B00005J8JI|4.0|Great album worth getting if you at all like Led Zeppelin. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I'd prefer the fuller version available in the 10 disc set. Walter's Walk, Poor Tom, We're Gonna Groove,etc..all great songs...
0345350499|2.0|I selected this book for a class I was taking about \\"Medieval in the Modern.\\" It took me, someone who can devour a book in a day, almost two months to read. And I'm not blaming my slow plodding through the book on the length. I'm sure if I was interested, I could have whipped through it. Unfortunately, I wasn't. The story is a retelling of the Arthurian legends from the women's viewpoints, namely Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. I often felt like the author was trying to make a page quota, because there were hundreds of pages of dialogue (lots of inter) that could have been taken out. The beginning bored me. The middle bored me further. The end picked up and got me interested for a while. However, overall, I was pretty disappointed. I don't think I'll be picking up anymore of the author's books.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|system of a down is a great band that is not afriad to try out new ideas. in their latest album, mezmerize, they do just that. sure, daron is not the best singer in the world, but he still is a great musician. besides, for all you people out there who say that he drives a hummer, WHO CARES? the only activist in the band is serj. if you're tired of politically charged lyrics, then soad is not a band for you! mezermize is a really cool album and it was kinda interesting to hear daron sing lead. let's just hope that hypnotize will have a little more serj and a little less daron... (if you're reading this review daron, please don't run us over with your hummer :-)
0375759174|4.0|I hear that authors never like people to pick their early works as their best, but I've always had a sneaking fondness for Northanger Abbey. Luckily, Jane Austen is unlikely to complain about me liking one of her earliest works. <br /> The novel's appeal is its extremely likeable anti-heroine, Catherine Morland. Catherine's appeal is her innocence and above all her fallibility. Of course, none of Austen's heroines are perfect, but Catherine has a charm that Austen's more self-possessed characters like Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennett lack. <br /> For this reason, I would say that Northanger Abbey can be a good introduction to Jane Austen, especially for younger readers, who may identify more readily with Catherine's naivete than with some of Austen's more mature characters. <br /> As ever, Austen is in fine satirical form, but she and her characters stop short of outright mocking the fanciful Catherine and her unfortunate novel-reading habits. As one might expect, the novel ends with Catherine's reform, redemption would perhaps be too strong a term to use here, and Austen allows the imperfect Catherine to shine among a sea of other imperfect characters. (Naturally, some are more imperfect than others.) <br /> One of the novel's stated objects is to satirise the gothic novels of Mrs. Radcliffe and her imitators. For the most part, Austen succeeds admirably, but once again her treatment of the subject is rather gentle. Although not many people these days will read the original gothic novels, I'm sure there are plenty of people out there addicted to contemporary fantastical horror that would crack a wry smile at the story, and be able to identify with 'poor' Catherine. <br /> Perhaps at times the characters do seem to be a little overstated, maybe a little too black and white, but this is a very creditable early effort from Austen, and perhaps some of her characterisation issues can be traced back to her use of the gothic novel as inspiration. <br /> All in all, a fine book, and certainly one for all of those 'almost pretty' girls out there who have their heads stuck inside books at every opportunity.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|I rated this CD down because of the order of songs.  I like to visualize the movie as the songs play.  Many of the songs are in a different order than in the film.  It makes for a very disjointed listening experience.  Vol. 2 is even worse.  The variety of music was awe inspiring; not my first choice for the scene, but it worked...always!  But, by putting songs out of order,, it interrupted the flow of the images of the film.  Please stop doing that.
0790729725|4.0|Yes a classic gangster movie.  What's the deal with the flip-over?  Half the movie is on one side and the other half is on the other side.  This would be a 5 star movie but it is stupid that half way into it you have to flip the disc to see the second half.  Patton and The Godfather are 3 hours long all on one side of the disc.  Very amatuerish.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Listeners will either love it or not be moved by it.  Since I really love Celtic music, I found the music relaxing and stimulating.  I like that it follows the music of the film; I can recreate the pace of the movie by listening to the music.  I wish other soundtracks would do the same.
1400082773|5.0|'Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance' , though one can almost feel the captivating intensity of the author's personal life in the pages of this memoir, Obama's winning combination derives mainly from his tell-it-like-it-is approach in addressing the multifaceted cold-stone reality that has continued to define the world in Black and White. He not only correlates the intricacies of racial relation that resonate across the continents but also sought to achieve workable solutions that would some day line up a ray of hope that points to a color blind society. <br />For the most part, it is hard not to identify with his story whether one grew up herding cows and goats, or having been born clutching a silver spoon in the mouth.
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead's eponymous second effort is, for me anyway, the superior example of their sound.  The LP is more of a slow burn than their debut, the beats are more thoroughly cultivated high drama which work beautifully with Beth Orton's delicate delivery. I know I will receive some detractors but, here goes, ahem...'Dummy' was a bit too reliant on gimmicks and obvious \\"hip-hop\\" cliches and I think the tunes fly by a bit. Thankfully on \\"Portishead\\" they opted to go a bit deeper and the result is a more engrossing listen. Recommended. Also check \\"Live at Roseland\\".
B0000AZAUM|5.0|This review focuses on the SACD remix of this timeless classic.  Presuming you already love this music and have wandered here looking for validation to purchase the music in the re-configured format, let me cut to the chase and let you know it sounds wonderful.  Some albums from this era use the rear channels sparingly to fill the room with swells and ambience, see Goodbye Yellow Brick Road for an example of this treatment.  Others like Dark Side of the Moon and T. Rex Electric Warrior give each speaker its own soundtrack.  Ziggy Stardust falls in the middle, giving plenty of separate treats for each speaker, but never hitting you in the face with the \\"tricky-ness\\" of it or detracting from the listening experience.  A great way to hear this great album.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|i love the OC and the second season is better than the first!  The episondes are much better with amazing stories!  I love it i am addicted to the OC!!!
B0007XT87G|3.0|Most Americans heard of Porcupine Tree with the release of 2002's In Absentia, and had a lot of catching up to do.  Unapologetically progressive, it was obvious that Steve Wilson's musical collective grew up on Yes and Floyd and Tull and Genesis.  Yet this being the new millennium, they were also familiar with Metallica-sized riffs and System of a Down-esoterica.  Since prog is the new punk, Porcupine Tree are now seen as harbingers.   Deadwing, their tenth (I think) studio release, is a consolidation not a stretch.  The heaviest numbers are the most concise, especially the one-two punch of \\"Shallow\\" and \\"Halo\\".  Elsewhere, they jam, particularly well on the opening title track.  They're superb at it, they are, but they aren't Zeppelin, and they remind me of a wonderful (and obscure) progressive outfit from the late 70's called Crack the Sky, whom I have to admit I'd rather listen to.
B00005JMX6|3.0|Unrated version of the R-rated comedy (rated R for strong sexual content, language and some drug/alcohol use). Contains nudity (for a movie that includes the adult film industry, there is less nudity than you might expect), and profanity.    <br /> <br />DVD Features: The 2-sided DVD (don't forget to turn over the DVD to the B side) contains the movie, and some special features.  Side A: movie; Special Features: Feature Commentary by the director and feature trivia track.  Side B: Special Features: \\"Scene Specific Commentaries by\\" the two leads (six shared scenes, one scene with just Hirsch and two scenes with just Cuthbert (\\"we really rehearsed the big scenes\\"); \\"The Eli Experience\\" (a visit to a real adult convention in Las Vegas); \\"A Look Next Door\\" (feature about the movie (contains nudity)); \\"Gag Reel\\"; Deleted and Extended scenes (16 scenes including the original ending includes director commentary); Still Gallery; Trailers (three movie specific trailers and one movie reel (clips from several movies)). <br /> <br />Credits: The movie stars Emile Hirsch (Matthew Kidman - student council president; \\"Lords of Dogtown\\"), Elisha Cuthbet (Danielle; \\"24\\"; \\"House of Wax\\"), Timothy Olyphant (Kelly; \\"Deadwood\\"), James Remar (Hugo Posh; \\"Blade:Trinity\\"), Chris Marquette (Eli; \\"Joan of Arcadia\\"), and Paul Dano (Klitz; one episode of \\"The Sopranos\\"). Also starring Sung Hi Lee (Ferrari; \\"Nurse Betty\\"), Ulysses Lee (Samnang; \\"Day of Independence\\") and Matt \\"Horshu\\" Wiese (Mule; a.k.a. Luther Reigns - \\"WWE\\"). The director is Luke Greenfield (\\"The Animal\\"). <br /> <br />Plot: The movie is about a group of kids in the last part of their last year in high school and about a hot new 19-year-old female (Danielle) that moves in next door to a high school senior named Matthew (movie specifically focuses on Matthew).  Danielle and Matthew hook up after Danielle tries to break Matthew out of his shell.  The day after they kiss for the first time, trouble develops when he learns that she is an ex-porn star.  He learned this interesting tidbit from his friend that likes to watch a lot of porn.     <br /> <br />Review: The movie opens with a yearbook photo shoot and a fantasy like segment where the students show/mention what they will always remember (the movie starts as if it will turn into a porno movie and then we see that it is just a high school photo shoot).  The movie focuses in on three geeky males that appear to be unpopular, though one of them had the ability, at some point, to get the rest of the senior class to vote for him to be their student council president.  Judging by how the students around him act, and his speech at the pep rally, it would probably be the case that he won because everyone else was busy goofing around and skipping class. <br /> <br />Matthew first sees the new girl next door as she wanders up to her house while Matthew is taking the trash out to the curb.  He does not greet her. Later, he spots her stripping in her room, and he watches her, and she catches him watching.  She then immediately walks over to his house, and Matthew thinks he is in trouble with her and his parents.  Danielle doesn't mention it to the parents and Matthew and Danielle end up driving through the city, and that is how they meet.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure I like any of the characters in this movie, and I'm not sure if that is good or bad acting.  I've only seen one of the actors before (the one from \\"24\\") so I can't compare previous/post acting jobs by any of the other actors.  I'm not sure, but the girl from \\"24\\" might have progressed in her acting ability.   <br /> <br />Interesting, the movie reminds me of a \\"Dream On\\" episode, \\"The Charlotte Letter,\\" where the lead, Martin Tupper, dates a woman (Charlotte).  Everything is going fine in the relationship until a friend points out to Martin that the woman is an ex-porn star, and then Martin suddenly can't stop seeing Charlotte in porn star positions, regardless of the setting (TV show:at a party; this movie: meeting his parents; Plot; there is also a plot line near the end of the TV show \\"Sports Night\\" series where one of the anchors, Dan, dates a current porn star).  There are major differences between the two plot-lines though (\\"Dream On\\" and this movie).  In the TV episode the man has already slept with the woman, talks about his problem, and they resolve it.  In the movie, the boy/man hasn't already slept with the woman, doesn't talk about his problem, and tries to get her drunk so that he can sleep with her (and I've suddenly realized that I've already seen this movie or I've seen this exact plot-line elsewhere, since I don't recall seeing this movie before).   <br /> <br />Wherever the high school is set (California?), everything looks real instead of a stage (setting).  The gang also visit Los Vegas.  Based on the short drive, it would appear that they could be from Baker, CA (from Oakland, it is 558.87 miles, eight hours 55 minutes; from Bakersfield: 286.50 miles; from Baker CA it is just one hour and 24 minutes away). The view of Vegas looked real, but the action that occurs indoors could have occurred in any convention center.   <br /> <br />Overall, I'd rate this movie 3.45 stars.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Amazing! I would say she out did herself except I know that this is her standard. You may not like her persona, her attitude, her look, or her brash way of speaking reality, but her lyrics speak to everyone and if nothing else you have to appreciate her voice. She is one of the few out there with real talent. Her lyrics she writes herself (which is rare these days). In her song \\"Walk Away\\" she explains how \\"I hate to show that I've lost control/ Cause I keep going right back to the one thing that I need to walk away from.\\"  I don't know one person who hasn't had something to walk away from whether it be a relationship, an addiction, or a bad habit.  And the song \\"Beautiful\\" talks about the insecurities we all feel.  Once again, I don't know one person who hasn't experieced self doubt in terms of weight, acne, body tone, or inner beauty. The messages she sends are loud and clear, and her voice brings them across in a fresh, clear, and pure voice. The song \\"I'm Ok,\\" well let's just say that I was physically abused by my ex, and this song personifies so many feelings. But even if you can't appreciate the words, everyone should appreciate her voice. She hits every note, and she sounds the same when she performs live (meaning that there is pratically no voice additives like so many other artists). Her voice is uniquely pure, and refreshing in a pop culture where anyone can become famous for their vocals (ex. Hilary Duff, Britney Spears, etc.)
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been a HUGE U2 fan for over twenty years.  However, after the first listen I would have given this cd 3 stars.  I am glad I waited.  This cd grows on you.  You'll find that the songs will just pop into your head.  My favorites  City of Blinding Lights and Original of the Species.  I had the opportunity to see the band perform both of these songs live last night - they blew me away!!!!
B000002KHH|1.0|Yes, the only reason you are here is for Iron man, paranoid, and war pigs....Ozzy was a horrible singer... Yes. <br /> <br />Althought this album is over 30 years old, that doesn't mean its good does it? Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple are about the same age as Sabbath and they were just as bad. <br /> <br />While the 60s did bring us all this \\"shock rock\\", atleast the classics have given us good artists from the disco era who are still remembered til today unlike those forgotten classic rock bands Led Zeppelin, Kiss, and The Doors. <br /> <br />Plus, most classic metal sucked, with the exception of Rap-metal of the late 80s/early 90s. <br /> <br />For good and truly inspritational metal, just listen to any of these modern MTV bands, because they are very groundbreaking.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down is a really special band.  They have a magical energy to their music that is very very rare.  The new CD does not dissapoint.  The same unique mix of sounds that has given them success in the past is here once again in mezmerize.  If you love system as much as i do, you will definately love this album.  However, the cd as a whole, is not quite the masterpiece that Toxicity was.  The cd feels more like an experimentation for the band.  It jumps here and there and tries new sounds and tempos a lot.  This isn't bad.  I think most of their experimentation works, its just that it gives the cd as a whole kind of a jumbled feeling.  Maybe this was on purpose:  i don't know.  but this is the only reason i say it is inferior to toxicity.  but let's face it, system's worst album is still lightyears beyond most of the stuff out there!
B000001Y5X|5.0|I LOVE this album! It's my favorite Manson album for sure. It's got so much: clever lyrics, thundering drums, thick and fuzzy bass & guitar, and a totally kick-ass circusy organ that brings out a really cool psychedelic element. The production is fairly busy, with lots of really eerie samples and strange noises. Every song may not be perfect, but there's ALWAYS something interesting and creative going on in the mix. The lyrics seem to range from totally shocking to the point of being hilairious, to psychotically dark and twisted. The style is fresh and original, and I would even dare to say that this album has aged over time better than Antichrist Superstar has. The music may be primitive and simple, but it's very intense and unique, and the amount of sonic detail on this album is incredible. To the abbey of Thelema!
0061015725|1.0|This book is, sadly, one of the poorer scifi stories I've ever read. From cover to cover, it is filled with inane, trite convoluted plots and annoying unrealistic characters that take us on a whirlwind trip to nowheresville.  <br /> <br />Some less discriminating readers may enjoy this type of airport drivle, but I was rather tunred off by it. Anyone with a desire for any type of realism in a novel would be forced to ask several discriminating questions about the story. Why do these supposedly brilliant scientists act like territorial adolescents? Why are there only 5 workers in a billion-dollar nano-manufacturing plant? Why is the first hundred pages dedicated solely to the main characters 30-something midlife problems? Why do books like this always turn into zombie stories? <br /> <br />If you want to waste 5 bucks on a laugh, by all mean buy this book. Then destroy it.
B000002AHC|3.0|I am a sucker for guitar-based 60s music with any zing at all, but this Lp is an awkward production by a band in disarray, and it may be the most overrated 60s rock'n'roll record on Amazon.  It is not a pop classic in the way the Byrds' first few albums are, nor compellingly played in the way a later work like \\"Untitled\\" is. Save \\"Change is Now,\\"  a strong hook from this record is nearly impossible to name.     And let us be plain, despite unaccountable superlatives dished out in reviews here like free seconds at an overeager caf: the \\"Notorious Byrd Brothers\\"  isn't in the same zip-code, county, or atmospheric layer with the first two Buffalo Springfield albums, let alone \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Pepper.\\"  This record's true peers are the Chocolate Watchband's entries in the \\"Garage Psychedelia with Orchestral Garnish\\" menu.           In spite of fine bassist Chris Hillman,  a swingless \\"I-don't-wanna-go-to-school\\" quality is to the fore here; arrangements include horns (\\"Artificial Energy\\") and moog (\\"Space Odyssey\\") employed with trendy, cosmetic impulses, not creative conviction. Even \\"Change is Now,\\" probably the best song here, is indifferently played.   This Lp often sounds like a demo (as the bonus track demos attest), and much better Byrds' efforts exist on either side of \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers'\\" odd moment, which was the turn of 1968.  Curious cats indifferent to rhythm will still be fascinated, as reviews here attest, but if one is in search of a Byrds' equivalent of \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" or even lush, hook-laden tunes like the Byrds' \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better\\" or \\"8 Miles High,\\"  be wary.
B0007GADZO|3.0|OK,,,so I have been a loyal and loving fan of Vai since his early, early days; we are talking ealry 80's when I was just a lad.  I have bought every album and been to every show in Chicago (and other areas).  I anxiously awaited this album, popped it in and was deflated like a balloon, hissing all over the place with annoyance.  There isnt a sound, lick or riff on here that he hasnt done before?  I just dont understand what has happened?  Has Vai lost his edge?  Has he jammed everything that his guitar can offer him?  There is no argument that he is still amazing on the fretboard, but there are no surprises here.  Maybe he should put out an acoustic album?  I hope this is but a speed bump and his next effort will be a full, furious rip roaring sound explosion.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|... especially if you aren't too busy being a comic book purist to sit back and just enjoy a good popcorn movie. Yeah, it's not the deepest movie ever made, but it really doesn't have to be. As long as you don't try to ask too much of it, you'll find that it's really quite entertaining. And pretty. Normally I'd only give a movie of this caliber 4 stars, but I felt the need to beef up its rating a little in the face all the naysayers out there, so it gets a 5 from me.
B000002GBJ|5.0|This is BY FAR the best solo album Wakeman ever did. Students of analog keyboards TAKE NOTE: This album was THE album to listen to (along with perhaps Yes' \\"Close To The Edge\\") that *taught* those of us who OWNED and played Mellotrons in the '70's how to play them *well*.<br /><br />They are a tough beast to master and Wakeman was one of the very best to play them. When I saw him with Yes on the Close To The Edge Tour in the '70s his solo part of the show was comprised mostly of material from this album. And play it he did! And his setup looked exactly like the picture of him playing his keyboards that graces this album. He was *amazing* to watch and hear!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I got this expecting a good album, but not great.  I was shocked to find that this is one great album, top to bottom.  There are the radio-played 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' and 'Holiday,' but there's a lot more.  'Jesus of Suburbia' and the similar-in-length (about 10 minutes) 'Homecoming' successfully put 5 different songs together.  A good buy for anyone.
B000002GJH|5.0|You'll find it all within the compact disc here as Temple of the Dog released this one time side project as a tribute to the late Andy Wood of Mother Love Bone. Chris Cornell is at his finest here, then again, when is he not. With beautiful ballads such as \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\", \\"Times of Trouble\\" and the touching \\"All Night Thing\\" as well as \\"Hunger Strike\\" with Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam joining in and you've got one hell of an album, the true standout track for me, would have to \\"Reach Down\\" an awesome 11 minute all out, balls to the wall rocker, that is worthy of anything The Beatles, The Doors, Led Zeppelin have ever done.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Every time I buy a SOAD album, I am hesitant, I never think they'll be good.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got Toxicity, not as much with the Toxicity remnants on Steal This Album!, but I was happy to hear that my 13 bucks were well spent.  Basically the same kind of sound as on the previous albums.
B000001DWG|5.0|Andrew Wood along with the rest of Mother Love Bone, were ready to take the musical world by storm with the release of their 1990 debut LP, Apple. However a few weeks before MLB's national tour was about to begin, Wood overdosed in his apartment thus ending Mother Love Bone, thankfully the album as well as \\"Stardog Champion\\", Apple with bonus tracks that never made the final cut, we can all enjoy this fantastic collection of songs. LOVE ROCK AWAITS YOU!!!!
B0006213WG|4.0|This is an awesome album.  'Pieces' was a good song, until radio basically ruined it by playing it every 5 minutes, but there are plenty other great songs, my favorite being 'No Reason.'  As always, a very short disk, about 39 minutes, which made me wish they would have just added more songs.
B0000028M7|5.0|Easily one of the best albums of the 90's, as once again heroin destroys another brilliant musical mind, Layne Staley is missed 1967-2002

0156027321|4.0|This is an engaging book, elegantly constructed and simply written.  I read it in just 3 days, which is a true complment to any book. <br />However, I have to say that the experience was not quite as good as it could have been because reviewers and friends have built up this book SO MUCH.  I would certainly recommend this novel, but probably as the \\"reserve book\\" that you take along on a trip.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|The Freewheelin Bob Dylan is in my mind the finest album he has done. The album is filled with classics and personal favorites of mine that have stood the test of time. <br />Bob Dylan in my opinion was always his best when it was just him, his guitar and harmonica. This Album is from that period of his career.  <br />The album starts with the classic \\"Blowin in the wind\\". This is probably to this day his finest song, certainly his most well known. <br />\\"The Girl from the North Country\\"is about his ex girlfriend he left in Minnesota. To me this song is a personal favorite of mine.  <br />He then goes in the controversial \\"Masters of War\\" where he tells war mongers what he thinks about war and the way they decieve. <br />Skipping a few songs \\"A Hard Rains Gonna Fall\\" is another classic where he points out a nuclear holocaust and what might happen if there was one, again very contorversial. <br />\\"Dont Think Twice, Its Alright, is another personal favorite of mine. Ita about a failed relationship with a girl. <br />Bob Dylans Dream is another personal favorite. He recalls being young and carefree. This is one of his finest moments and oddly a song you dont hear people say much about, this song is a real find. <br />I play this song over and over, even to this day. <br />Oxford town is a tongue in cheek song about a visit there. <br />Talkin World War 3 blues is another song of note. <br />There is not a bad song on this album. What you are going to hear is very raw and Dylan at his very best. Enjoy

0812550706|1.0|Wouldn't it be neat if somebody recognized how brilliant you were, and took you out of the boring school you're at, and took you away from your dorky parents who don't like you anyway, and put you in this neat training facility with really cool arcade games and even a battle game that you got to play in zero gravity?  No?  Well then you must be a reader who's outgrown adolescence, and you won't like this book.   <br /> <br />How this piece of juvenile fiction ever won the Nebula and Hugo awards I'll never know.  The premise is that inter-stellar armies are best run by children with a predilection for violence.  Ender is the smartest and most violent of all and he manages to win every fight he's in by miraculously re-writing the book on tactics all on his own.  He outsmarts all the kids and adults he's up against with strategies that are bewilderingly original to the other characters in the book, but incredibly obvious to the reader.  It's kind of like Harry Potter goes to space, but with much less thought and writing talent.  <br /> <br />What a waste of time. <br /> <br />
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Matt Damon returns as secret agent Jason Bourne in \\"The Bourne Supremacy,\\" a first-rate espionage thriller that boasts a fine performance from the always reliable Joan Allen as well.<br /><br />The character made his first screen appearance in the wildly popular \\"The Bourne Identity\\" in 2002, a film based, as this one is, on a Robert Ludlow novel.  Bourne is one of a handful of agents who have been turned into little more than mindless killing machines through a (now defunct) top secret mind-altering program.  Despite suffering from a case of amnesia that has effective wiped out all memory of that time in his life, Bourne still has to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing all the horrible things he must have done while under the influence of the diabolical programming. As \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" opens, we find Jason living in India, trying to maintain a low profile as he attempts to create some kind of a \\"normal\\" life for himself and his girlfriend.  But, as always happens in these kinds of scenarios, reality intervenes, this time in the form of assassins sent out to kill him.  As if that weren't enough, Bourne is also being hunted by some CIA bosses who mistakenly believe that he has recently killed two of their own agents.  Thus, Bourne finds himself running for his life in a chase that takes him from India to Berlin to Moscow before the movie is over.<br /><br />With the Ludlow novel as his source, Tony Gilroy has written a complex screenplay that respects the audience's intelligence even when what is happening on screen doesn't always rate too high on the plausibility meter.  Amidst all the convoluted plotting, espionage doublespeak and hi-tech hardware that are the standard accoutrements for the genre, Gilroy manages to stay focused on the human drama at the story`s core, as a man struggles to piece together the puzzle of his life.  Allen makes an effective foil as the agent who first suspects Bourne of killing some of her undercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence.  Director Paul Greengrass keeps the action percolating along, maintaining a high level of suspense throughout.  He uses a handheld camera to convey the desperation of Bourne's plight and the fragmentation of his mind, often showing us incidents and events from the character's own point of view intercut with subliminal snatches of disconnected memories.  In addition, the lively, hurly burly editing keeps the picture constantly moving forward.  Personally, I could have done with fewer car chase scenes towards the end, since I have always found characters interacting to be more compelling than automobiles interacting, but I suppose that, when it comes to action film audiences, the beast must inevitably be fed.  On the positive side, John Powell has composed a dramatic musical score that really knows how to gin up the tension at crucial moments.<br /><br />As an actor, Damon combines the seemingly paradoxical elements of strength and vulnerability necessary to make his character believable and touching.  In Bourne, he seems to have found his perfect role.dercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence.

B00005JO8T|5.0|This morality tale about a Danish officer, his family and his troubled brother is one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.  It's brilliantly written and so full of unanticipated twists and turns that I found myself gasping on more than one occasion.  I don't want to say much about the plot of this film as I think it will spoil the experience of watching its complex story unfold.  You must see this masterful work of art!!
B000002HFU|4.0|ODB's unique drunken style of rapping had many listeners not understanding his vocal skills. This album exposes ODB of who he is, with his brutal honestly about everything in life. With half rapping, halfing singing and also ocassionally muttering incoherent mubbling, you can't help but love this album. Hard to listen to, yet hard to put down and as \\"RZA\\" as the no. 1 beat supplier, you can't go wrong.
B00062IVKI|2.0|Robert DeNiro play a self-centered womanizing abusive husband to Liza Minelli, who plays a doormat until a (literally) last-second conversion which is completely unbelievable.  The songs are great, the photography outstanding.  But the pain of watching this couple battle it out is not pleasant.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Many debate which is better, Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... or GZA's Liquid Swords. It has been discussed for over 10 years, but there is no result. One of the best that came out of Wu-Tang, with sharp lyrics and flawless production from RZA. Killah Priest gets credit for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth and with Invesitgative Reports, Raekwon shines on it. Although with \\"Labels\\" and \\"Gotcha Back\\" shows why GZA has labeled himself as the Genius.
6304233639|4.0|Huge alien ships descend on Earth, wiping out whole cities with their death-rays while themselves remaining safe behind their impenetrable energy screens. Those left by the death-rays are annihilated by swarms of enemy fighters that fly in huge, insect-like clouds (and are similarly shielded). Not even nukes can stop these guys. But one man has the brainstorm that may save the world.  <br /> <br />It's easy to say that this was THE popcorn flick to catch in 1996, but nearly 10 years later, it's easy to step back and see what else went right besides millions in CGI.  ID4 combined the right mix of FX, can-do ingenuity and patriotism missing from follow-ups like \\"Godzilla\\".  Bill Pullman plays the President, an ex-fighter jock who starts off telling his aides that \\"we have no cause to fear\\" until the alien baddies demolish the White House in the now classic money-shot. Jeff Golblume plays one of his stock characters - the brilliant-but-awkward type who despite his lowly tech job working for a cable TV service run by Harvey Fierstein, comes up with the idea that may defeat the aliens. Will Smith is the Marine who flies his F-18 like something out of Star Wars, and comes up with some of the flick's best lines and most of its sheer gusto.  <br /> <br />As a blockbuster, this flick grossed cash while naturally inflaming critics. In some ways, this alien-invasion epic deserves both the praise and criticism, though for reasons different than fans and panners would suggest. The special effects sometimes show their limits (especially at the end when the alien ships fly across the screen like mosquitoes, as opposed to those in \\"Star Wars\\" which alternate between being a dot in a huge on a frame of film in a complex background to filling the screen), and much of the visual impact is lost unless you've got the wide-screen version. The dialog won't win anybody any Oscars (the best lines sound conspicuously ad-libbed; the rest sounds no better than \\"you're father was a hero, you should be proud of him\\"), and some promising characters and ideas just get tossed out completely (especially those dealing with \\"Area-51\\" and the chief geeky scientist played by Trek alum Brent Spiner) before the script has any fun with them.  <br /> <br />WHY THIS MOVIE ROCKS (ANYWAY): The flick's imperfect FX are still spectacular and remain so nearly a (Star Wars-filled) decade later. Clearly the design team was inspired by SW, but had more than a creative nod than the hordes responsible for perpetrating the past 2 decades worth of SW rip-offs on us (\\"StarCrash\\" or \\"Message From Space\\" come to mind). Some of the characters rise above the sort of shallow cardboard you'd expect, or otherwise allow remnants of previous roles they've played to give more charm to their roles here (like Robert Loggia as a general, or Harry Connick Jr. in an inspired bit of miscasting as Will Smith's wing man). But above all, ID4 excels because its makers took an idea that was never really original but also took the bold step of handling it all - militant, locust like aliens, epic-scale dogfights, huge motherships, impenetrable force-fields - as if it had never been done before, and giving the whole premise an unmatched sense of depth.
B000002WU9|5.0|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... has to be one of the, if not, the best Wu-Solo CD. With sharp lyrics from \\"Raekwon\\", as well as the rest of Wu-Tang Clan featured in the album, especially \\"Ghostface\\" to the razor sharp production from the \\"RZA\\". It's a must to own, whether your a Wu-Head or not. Simply marvelous!!!
0609610570|2.0|This is a medicore book with some bright points.  It seems to be written more toward a high level executive and is at times repeatitive.  The book does not move well from topic to topic and tends to drone on about the importance of several items. <br /> <br />The highlight of the book is how it addresses the importance of find the right people - but this is covered equally as well in other books.
B0000024JA|4.0|Tical presents it's self as the world of Wu-Tang's freshest emcess, the Method Man. After their successful debut Enter The Wu-Tang, many would have thought that they would have settled down and later on make a new album, but instead they decided to capitalize and expand the Wu-Tang name by producing solo projects. Meth was first on the list, with 13 cuts like \\"All I Need\\" take from the Marvin Gaye sample and with hard hitting \\"Bring Da Pain\\" it seemed that Wu-Tang will still present their hardcore style with soft oldie tunes from several decades ago. Instead of giving us another 36 chambers album, it was a little dissapointing, yet the album is still a must have
B0007TKNII|4.0|I wasn't going to watch this movie. Ever since the first time I heard the original cast recording when I was in the eighth grade (I'm not telling you how long ago that was) I have been an absolute fan of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. I have saw the musical in London and thought it was okay. But my experience with movies based on anything else be it book, older movie or musical was that the new movie version carved the meat and color out of the story and served you the bland shell. <br />So I wasn't going to watch this movie. I studiously avoided it in the theatre.  <br />Then a friend insisted I watch it with her and after the ending I was ready to kick myself for not catching this in the theatre. Yes it's different, yes it's not the original cast. But the story is there and even parts of the back story you don't get in the original musical manage to get in. <br />I was pleasantly surprised with the range of emotions the cast was able to convey. While very different from the originals, this movie version of one of my favorite mucisals is perfectly able to stand alone and hold it's head up as a continuation of what I believe to be a great legacy. <br />Agree with me or not I don't care and it doesn't matter. Opinions will always vary. <br /> <br />
B0007DAZW8|2.0|After loving both Homework and Discovery and heralding Daft Punk as one of the finest French exports in recent years, I had high expectations of Human After All as being the album which decisively puts these guys in the pantheon of most influential electronic artists.<br /><br />Unfortunately this album falls so flat that anyone else who is fooling themselves into seeing genius in this work is simply doing that....fooling themselves!<br /><br />To think that DP could have possibly spent more than two days to record, produce and deliver this album to Virgin Records would be unimaginable.  The only thing that I can think of is that they are deperately trying to get out of their contract and by delivering this crap, they hope to fulfill their responsibilities with their label.<br /><br />I bought this CD used for $5, at that price I'm not mad but just disappointed.  If I would have paid (...)for this CD I would be mad, insulted and definitely trying my best to get my money back!<br /><br />By releasing this album, DP are giving fans an excellent reason to download their songs in the future instead of buying them.<br /><br />If DP are laughing all the way to the bank, I hope they enjoy it because this is the last time that it will happen!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Firts let me say that I have always held a great respect for SOAD. I am not a person who would normally be expected to be listen to this type of music. I enjoy and embrace all types of music from the rock of modern day to primative tribal music. When I tell people that I love SOAD, they often give me a strange look, surprised that I would be listening to this band that is often, in my opinion, wrongly grouped with the hard rock genre. What people do not understand is that this is not hard rock. It is in a genre of its own. Noone since Beethoven has revolutionized music as SOAD has. They take old things and make them new, while at the same time creating entirely new gems of music. <br />What I'm tired of is the lyrics and rock of our time. Lyrics about relationships with the opposite sex and predictable compostions make it almost unbearable after a while. Sometimes I feel I can predict what's coming next in the song before I have actually heard it. This is not true with SOAD. For example, in BYOB, it sound like four songs have been chopped up and then mixed together. While some may think its random, after awhile you realize the underlying things the band the choruses and verses together. Also, the lalalala-ing is an example of innovative vocals being employed by the brilliant song writer Serj. He is never afraid to try something new, such as letting Daron sing more. One of the main reasons I listen to SOAD is Serj's distinct and intriguing voice. Though I was surpised to hear Daron's voice coming out of my cd player, I did not dislike it. If he had started out singing and not the other way around, I think hearing Serj for the first time would be equally, if not more distressing, than hearing Daron's. <br />In closing, this is the greatest cd to come out for awhile. I strongly suggest you listen to the track \\"Violent Pornography\\" first, due to its amazing vocals.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I just saw the Priest live at the Budokan last week and they rocked!!! The band still has the magic and Rob was hitting all the high notes! My only disappointment was that they did not play anything from Defenders, not even my fav \\"The Sentinel\\". Anyways, they played half the songs from this their new cd. Some reviewers are calling AOR one of their best and some reviewers are calling it crap. I think it's the best thing they have done since DOTF so I am giving 4 stars. I don't understand the people who are complaining that JP are just rehashing the same material. If they came out with something completely different those same people would probably say that JP sold out. I do agree that Lochness is a bit silly. I wonder who said \\"Hey, let's write a 13 minute song about the Lochness Monster!\\". Also, there are not as many classic trade-off solos between KK and Tipton. But the riffs still rock! My favorites are Judas Rising (Halford howls!), Worth Fighting For (nice chugging riff after the chorus), Wheels Of Fire (cool mid tempo rocker), Angel (good ballad), and Eulogy (classic old Priest). The other half of the album is not bad. I can't say this is one of the best Priest albums ever, but it is worth getting. Check them out live if you get the chance!

B00000K0T8|4.0|With Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... we saw Ghostface as an important link with the Wu-Tang Clan. I don't believe Ghostface was noticed as much on Wu-Tang's first LP as was on Rae's Joint. It only made sense that Ghost would go solo, but it failed to live up to Only Built, but not to say Ghostface's LP was a total letdown. With his ability to rip MC's apart with RZA soulful production, it seemed that it was the perfect weapon. With \\"Wildflower\\" and \\"All That I Got Is You\\" there is obivously two sides of Ghostface. This album also features the Razor Sharp \\"Winter Warz\\" which presented Cappadonna more than Ghostface. Yet Ghostface overcomes all obstacle with this Wu-Banga.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The first problem with the Star Wars prequels, is that they will never satisfy the geeks who remember the original three movies as far better than they actually were. <br /> <br />The other problem is George Lucas has just gotten too carried away with effects and digital animation.  The movie almost becomes ancillary to showcasing all the cool things he can do.   <br />Its hard to know how to characterize the Star Wars prequels - they're practically animated features with live actors in them, rather than the other way around. <br /> <br />The Lord of the Rings movies really played havoc with the Lucas formula as well, because frankly, WETA digital/WETA workshop blew Lucas' ILM & the Star Wars effects out of the water.  Suddenly, Lucas' motion pictures - one of the main appeals of which was to check out the awesome special fx - weren't all that impressive when you saw what Peter Jackson and WETA were doing in LOTR. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are many who place FAR too much importance and too many expectations on these movies (see said geeks above).  If you take the Star Wars movies for what they are - fun, mindless, popcorn sci-fi/action/adventure films - I really don't see how you can be disappointed. <br /> <br />When it comes down to it, Lucas is really guilty of only a couple serious lapses in judgment in making the prequels - Jar Jar Binks being the undisputed GREATEST of these.  But the guy did make Star Wars (A New Hope) - which revolutioned not just the genre (sci-fi), but motion pictures - and stuck it to Hollywood in the process.  I tip my hat to him. <br /> <br />Lighten up folks - throw the DVD in on your big screen, dim the lights, crank up the surround sound and enjoy the ride.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|If Iron Maiden is the only band you listen to, and you worship them like the 'emperor's new clothes' then you will love this album.  However, if you are intelligent you should be able to realize that there's nothing special here.  Just another cookie-cutter Maiden album.  It's basically just as good as BRAVE NEW WORLD, except now the excitement has worn off that Bruce is back. <br /> <br />'Rainmaker' is an OK song, except the German band Vanden Plas put out a song with the same name on their album, THE GOD THING.  The Vanden Plas song is much better.  The title track is also worthy of being played at concerts, but the band is pretty much running on vapors at this point.  I don't understand why they don't get rid of Janick Gers and start putting out the kind of music we hear on Bruce's solo records.  Is Steve Harris's ego really that big?   <br /> <br />I don't even know why I bought this.
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|I sat down to this movie,expecting the worst...bad script, terrible matching between the actors involved, a story that made zero sense....not the case at all!! Fun romp of action, intrigue, and just plain great!!  I was riveted by this film and had to know what was going to happen next!!  <br />Great effects, style...everything all rolled into one!!  <br />Great for the kids to watch too!!
B000002GVO|1.0|Glad to see i'm not the only one who thinks this album stinks. The Eagles are terrible. NIGHTMARE SITUATION: you're in a car stuck with some smuck who likes this trash. That's one of the few times i can relate to Hotel California, a song about not being able to escape.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream isn't that innovative as some say, and SP never were that influental or innovative as many claim, the influence is mostly from The Pixies and Zeppelin. And basically SP remind much of Nirvana in some songs too, but Corgan always hated Nirvana, but yet said they were competing against them in popularity, and that's what I don't like 'bout the guy, the competing (?), that wasn't the point with grunge (since bands worked together all the time and were friends), but Corgan said he had to compete against other grunge bands and be better ? dumb! and yeah, they were better than many definitely, but not that original...okay, that's my introduction... <br />To the songs; \\"Cherub Rock\\", an awesome riff and great vocals and melodies, an awesome track with probably the sweetest guitar solo of the whole 90's! \\"Disarm\\", is a little cheesy and easy, but it's beautiful, it's probably the most personal track here, and slightly touching, the powerful strings and an easy acoustic guitar plus some bells make this an interestingly beautiful, however simplistic song, truly a masterpiece, maybe even a little overdriven, this song is at the line, if you should cry or laugh to it, it's so weird but yet makes a lot of sense, however. \\"Mayonaise\\" ,\\"Rocket\\" and \\"Today\\" are harder songs with mellow singing and crunchy thick guitars, and these type of songs were I think the best part of SP, easy, yet inventive and extremely powerfull riffs and mellow and sensitive singing by Billy Corgan, great! Lyrically I think the band fails to bring anything that extraordinary, but the songs are never statement songs, mostly personal themes, or themes that get in the shadows of the music, I guess those songs with deeper meanings often are too hard to understand, while the easy ones are really easy indeed, like \\"Today\\". I think the Pumpkins have taken the most influence by The Pixies, but are very aware of the \\"grunge\\" sound, if you know what I'm saying, Nirvana and especially Alice In Chains does ring a bell. All in all I think this album is a masterpiece, I don't think the most innovative music's never been the best, like Radiohead, who always try to be so original, but they're so boring, I think the very best songs of all time are songs that have a tight structure and that are after all very simplistic, not too cryptic or slow, powerfull and majestic riffs and some almost childishly sensitive singing by Corgan made the magic of Smashing Pumpkins. I think \\"Mellon Collie\\", was still okay, but \\"Machina\\" and \\"Adore\\", were boring, especially with over-experimenting and electrics, I guess the Pumpkins never figured out how to make great music after this and the follower, guess they didn't want to repeat and they made some crappy music, but this one here is a timeless and epic classic, a must-have for 90's rock diggers!
B00001W9G0|5.0|As stated many times before, THE WAY WE WERE is one of only a handful of romantic blockbusters to actually feature an intelligent script and complex characters.  Writer Arthur Luarents' based his screenplay (and subsequent novel) on girl he knew in college, who fought for liberal (and sometimes communist) causes.  Three decades after it's release, THE WAY WE WERE remains one of the few cinematic depictions of the Red Scare that swept America in the forties and fifties; the backdrop of which lends the surrounding love story greater potency and depth.  The film was a surprise box office smash when originally released, and became the fifth-highest grossing film of 1973 and was instantly embraced as a classic.      Katie Morosky is a character that Barbra Streisand born play, and she delivers on all accounts.  Fierce and determined, yet vulnerable and self-conscious, Katie is a tricky character and Streisand inhabits her so deeply that she seems nothing less than completely believable.  Justifiably nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, she inexplicably lost to Glenda Jackson's shrill performance in the barely remembered A TOUCH OF CLASS.  This was clearly a major blunder on the side of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Robert Redford, who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part, displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the All-American golden boy (although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film, he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING).      THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death, feuding families, or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart.  Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile, and contrasting, ideologies; theconflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today.  The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford, the gorgeous cinematography, and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack.  However, it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.    About the DVD:  The picture quality is very good, quite possibly the best the film has ever looked.  You must remember that movie has always had a stylistically hazy look.  The sound quality is also vastly improved.  Pollack's commentary track is interesting, but the 60-minute documentary is the best extra on the disc.  Featuring insightful interviews from Pollack, Streisand, and Laurents (as well as composer Marvin Hamlisch and lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman) the documentary is well-produced and entertaining, and it was great to finally see those much-debated deleted scenes.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I was pumped when I heard Bruce was coming back.  I was afraid the name of Iron Maiden was going to be further dragged through the mud with Blayze \\"Mouth Full of Marbles\\" Bayley.  I even saw the comeback tour at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, MA as well as a show on the Brave New World Tour in Hartford, CT with Queensryche and Rob Halford.  It is great seeing Maiden on a reunion tour with Bruce, but part of the reason this gets four stars, is the pure excitement of Bruce back in the band.  This helps hide the fact that the album itself is pretty unoriginal.   <br /> <br />Iron Maiden, just like ACDC and Aerosmith, has this tendency to put out cookie cutter albums.  You hear one Maiden song, you've pretty much heard them all.  The band is still good in my book, but nowhere near as creative or innovative as bands like King Crimson, Dream Theater, Rush, Zappa, etc.  I think the band should have released this album as an EP with 4 songs - the first three tracks, which are the best written plus the progressive 'Dream of Mirrors' - followed it with a tour and broke up the band for good.  Besides, Bruce Dickinson's ACCIDENT OF BIRTH and THE CHEMICAL WEDDING are both much better than BRAVE NEW WORLD anyway.  I also think BRAVE NEW WORLD sounds kind of watered down.  There's too much repetition in lyrics and instrumental sections, and if removed, could have made some of the songs shorter.  I like long songs, but they cannot sound the same throughout the whole song.  It's also unecessary to have three guitarists in a band.  They should have canned Janick Gers when Adrian Smith came back. <br /> <br />This is basically FEAR OF THE DARK with Adrian Smith.  Fun while it lasted, but this isn't 1982, and either develop your sound or quit.  I don't think Iron Maiden fans want to see this band turn into a nostalgia act.
B00007BK2N|4.0|Yes, this is one of my favorite films. But people here seem to be voting the negative reviews as not being \\"helpful\\" only because they are offended that some one insulted their precious movie. Lame. Fans of the 80's Manchester music scene will enjoy this movie, but it could have been done so much better. That music era deserves a much better documentary than this poorly structured film. I really do like this movie, but the negative reviews here that I read ARE pretty accurate, and can be helpful. I do appreciate the reviewers who are at least being honest.  <br />The Joy Division scenes in this film are great! The actor who played Ian Curtis really captured his intensity. It felt like I was really watching Curtis. So check this movie out. Just know that it WILL drag at certain points.
0689878451|5.0|What a wonderful book. This story of two male penguins who were given the chance to nurture an egg and the penguin chick they hatched had me smiling from page one. My five year old was enchanted and I know that it will be a frequent re-read. I love the message of diversity, the story that's told in a loving way but mostly I love the illustrations. The fuzzy penguin chick pictures  alone are worth the price of the book.

B00005JLTR|5.0|A blockbuster at the time of it's original release (it was the second-highest grossing film of 1976), the third screen version of A STAR IS BORN has always divided critics and fans alike.  The film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $5.6 million-budgeted picture went on to gross over $150 million at the box office and won an Academy Award and five Golden Globes.  It's not without some irony that Streisand's most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial.  For every ten fans who state that STAR is Streisand's best film, there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography.  Although both sides have some merit to support their claims, it should still be noted that the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that Hollywood ever produced.  For my money, it's the best version of the often-told tale.    The film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing. Changing the setting from the old Hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea, and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters' romance and their careers. This is the main area that the 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN actually surpasses it's classic predecessors. For example, the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never-ending phone calls that interrupt Kristofferson's songwriting attempts. This version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters. For example, the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self-sacrificing that they came off as saints. On the other hand, Esther, the female lead in this version, is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate, but also flawed and conflicted. This makes her feel more real than the Janet Gaynor or Judy Garland charactersfelt in the previous films, and makes the story that much more effective.     The performances are all on target, even though the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough. If you're looking for an actress/singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance, Streisand is definitely the girl you want. She's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural, and, as usual, she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer. Simply put, her Esther is a fully-realized, three-dimensional human being. Kris Kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid-back characterization, however, he's always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career. Kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from Newsweek, Time, and even the New Yorker's usually vicious Pauline Kael. Gary Busey and Paul Mazursky also give believable performances, but both have a fairly minimal amount of screentime.     The film's soundtrack recording was also a massive success, hitting the #1 on Billboard's Hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the US alone. The Streisand-composed \\"Evergreen\\" (with lyrics from Paul Williams) is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop, brought to even-further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from Streisand. The rest of the film's original songs (mostly composed by Williams and Rupert Holmes) are pretty good as well, and Streisand sounds fantastic - her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded. Streisand's vibrant performances bring \\"Woman In The Moon\\" and \\"With One More Look At You\\" to thrilling life, and make even sillier numbers like \\"Queen Bee\\" work far better than they have the right to. Kristofferson's solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless, however, that may have been intentionalsince he is playing a singer in decline.     Though naturally dated in some respects (it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made), the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN still holds up remarkably well.  The film is well-mounted and slickly produced, the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine, and Streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective.  In conclusion, A STAR IS BORN is not only entertaining and moving, but it also transcends all criticism.    DVD UPDATE (12-6-06):  The A STAR IS BORN DVD is finally here after several delays, and it was worth the wait.  The picture quality is well above average, and is very film-like.  Sure, there are the usual tale-tale signs that mar all films from the seventies (namely grain and inconsistent sharpness), but the transfer is great for a catalogue title that is over the 30 years old.  The 5.1 sound is exceptional even by modern-day standards.    As far as supplements, Streisand's commentary is informative and entertaining, although I would have loved to hear Kristofferson join her on at least some scenes.  The wardrobe test reel is good fun, and the 12 deleted/alternate scenes are great to have.  I wish that the promotional television special \\"With One Look at You\\" and Streisand's thrilling performance of \\"Evergreen\\" from that year's Oscar telecast had also been included, but perhaps Warner Home Video could not secure the rights.  All in all, with great picture, exceptional sound, and a healthy portion of supplements, the A STAR IS BORN DVD was well worth waiting for.
B000063DHK|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  LIVE AFTER DEATH is without a doubt, the best Iron Maiden live album.  It comes to us from the POWERSLAVE tour, and is comprised of a nice selection of tracks from the first five Maiden records.  My only complaint is they only have one track from KILLERS - 'Wrathchild' - I would have at least like to have seen the song, 'Killers' as well. <br /> <br />The more popular songs don't need much explanation here, except to note there is a great sing-along section in the middle of 'Running Free' where Bruce tells the crowd that he wants the crowd to sing so loud he wants to be able to go back to the hearing doctor in London and say, \\"Doctor, Long Beach f***ed up my hearing for good.\\"  Hilarious.   <br /> <br />The best parts of this release are the songs we don't hear on any other live Maiden albums.  Those would be 'Powerslave,' 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner,' 'Wrathchild,' 'Aces High,' 'Revelations,' 'Flight of Icarus,' '22 Acacia Avenue,' 'Children of the Damned,' 'Phantom of the Opera,' and 'Die With Your Boots On.'  You can actually see them perform some of those songs on the MAIDEN ENGLAND home video, but they never appeared on any of the other four live maiden albums. <br /> <br />This is also a great introduction for anyone new to this band.  It's a great live performance of Maiden songs from 1980-1984, plus you get to hear Paul DiAnno songs with Bruce on vocals. <br />
B00030GMO0|4.0|There are 3 great songs on this album.  The rest are not bad (mostly filler) but I would absolutely buy this for \\"somebody told me,\\" \\"mr. brightside,\\" and especially \\"smile like you mean it.\\"  The synth pop rock of the last song reminds me of the 80's and i must admit that i can put the song on repeat and fall asleep to it and then listen to it for hours the next day and then again in my car if i go somewhere.  the songs are very simple. . . they write one verse and a hook and repeat -- few artists have the production to get away with that sort of thing. <br /> <br />I also appreciate the gospel choir in \\"all these things that i've done.\\"  It's the kinda thing you hear in the Kanye West tracks that aren't singles.  Not as much to the liking of mainstream opinion but good music nonetheless.
B0006399FS|2.0|Here a point, people; Artist who are in the cover picture of their albums often suck, and boy, I'm right. U2 can play solid poprokc and they made great music back in the day, but now they have nothing new to offer. Their music is as old as Bono's sunglasses! This album is so corny and boring, that omg! \\"Vertigo\\", the grunge-influenced powerpop track is kinda sweet but the rest blows!  <br />WHO SHOULD BUY THIS: TRUE U2 FANS WHO DON'T THINK THEY EVER GET OLD <br />WHO SHOULDN'T BUY THIS: EVERYONE EXCEPT TRUE U2 FANS <br />simple as that
B00000AFWW|5.0|I have been willin to review this album but haven't had the chance. I've owned it since it came out and last nite I had the pleasure in hearing it again and I was blown away with it like I was the first time I heard it.  <br /> <br />Hole's 'Celebrity Skin' can be one of the best albums ending the 90's. It's hot, sexy and it's rockin'! Courtney Love's voice is so apropiate for the music and the rest of the band gives out one great studio performance aswell. I'm not gonna lie, what really got my attention from this band (Besides the smash hit 'Malibu') was that 3 out of the 4 memebers were these sexy rock lookin chicks. Now ain't that hotter when jammin' to these tunes?  <br /> <br />Indeed with colaboration from artists like Billy Corgan from Smashin Pumpkins, Courtney really did find the way to make this album superb in all ways. Grunge rock with good punk ingredients and that all sexy goddess Courtney's voice makes this album a great one. Was this it to Hole? If not, will be lookin foward for a follow up; but if so, what a way to end it.  <br /> <br />Get this album!  <br /> <br />
0679729895|4.0|This collection of short stories is an impressive showcase of Roald Dahl's writing talent as well as his vast knowledge of various subjects.<br /><br />Drawing upon his own experiences in life, and peppered with Dahl's trademark humour, \\"Tales Of The Unexpected\\" often managed to provoke a knowing smile, some unsavoury thoughts, and if you allow your imagination to run a bit wild, possibly spine-chilling conclusions to some of the stories.<br /><br />However, several pieces in \\"Tales Of The Unexpected\\" have rather abrupt endings, and because of that, a few left me with a big question mark after reading. Like, \\"Huh?\\"<br /><br />Had these been written by someone else, I would have assumed that the author was simply too lazy to carry on writing. But somehow the master of macabre got away with the open-ended treatment of his tales, at times even compensating the inconclusive ending with immaculate pace and a surprising twist.<br /><br />In cruel terms, you can say he got away with murder. Just like Mary Maloney in \\"Lamb to the Slaughter\\".

0743455967|3.0|About the only thing in common between King and myself is our first name. Other than that, our views on writing (based on those expressed in this book) could be worlds apart.<br /><br />It's not necessarily true that I disagree with the points he raised. Just that writing is such an individual undertaking that no hard-and-fast rule can ever hold true. And King imposes several such rules in his book.<br /><br />An example is King's insistence on the use of adverbs in dialogue attribution \\"only in the rarest and most special of occasions\\". This may actually compromise a writer's individual style. The point here is that not everybody aspires to be a good dialogue writer. Imagine populating a 30-page dialogue with purely \\"he/she said\\".<br /><br />While many of his advice are spot-on indeed, you can't help but wonder if it makes sense to follow them. After all, not everybody wants to write fiction. And certainly not everybody wants to write fiction the way King does.<br /><br />For instance, King harbours a deep distrust for plot. Instead, he prefers to start with a situation and mould the character from there. This approach may not work for writers whose strength lies elsewhere.<br /><br />True, the story should always be the boss. But if your characters were shallow, readers would have a hard time developing a sense of association. And if readers cannot associate with the character, think of how they would feel about the story itself.<br /><br />Part of the problem with \\"On Writing\\" is that you need to be familiar with King's work in order to understand the points he's driving at. I wouldn't consider this approach as a shameless plug on the part of the author, but it does make it more difficult for non-fans to align themselves to his ideas.<br /><br />All in all, \\"On Writing\\" is a good read if you want to gain insight into the thought processes of one of the most successful fiction writers of our times. But if you follow the tips to a T, you may end up as another Stephen King, which may not exactly be a good thing.another Stephen King, which may not exactly be a good thing. <br />
B0002X314C|4.0|I recently found John Legend's CD at my local library, and after hearing all of the hype, I decided to check the cd out. Like others have said, I can not listen to it enough. For starters, i'm no huge R&B/Soul fan, but this CD is very infectious, and I like the \\"male alicia keys\\" thing people have been talking about. Kanye's beats along with Legends voice and lyrics drive this album to great heights. No, Legend doesn't have the greatest range or tone, but he does a fantastic job and has a very soft voice. The first half of this album is your more \\"up tempo\\" club type songs, while the second half if your more laid back, chill with your girlfriend and enjoy songs. This may dissappoint some, but it may not bother others. Personally, it doesn't bother me at all. After hearing the uptempo songs, you wonder \\"if these songs are this great, what are his slow jams gonna be like?\\" My personal highlights are:Track 4:AlrightTrack 7: I can changeTrack 8: Ordinary People which is just Legend singing with just him and the piano.Track 11: So Highand of course, the title track Let's Get Lifted

0385510454|4.0|A very interesting and informative read.  The book was so fun to read, i finished it in 2 days.  The plot is good but not great, but a good read none the less.  The story is not as captivating as the partner or the firm, but still beats some of his other great books.  There is not as much caricature in character descriptions as compared to the rain maker.  Ive read most of his books (except the last juror, the summons and bleachers) and this book would be in my top 6.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|Mariah Carey is back with a new album. It is safe to say it's better than her 2002 album CHARMBRACELET. I like the ballads a lot on this disc, including \\"Joyride\\", \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"Mine Again\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", etc. The uptempo songs are good too including \\"It's Like That\\", \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Get Your Number\\" etc. Overall a solid album from Ms. Carey.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|I've been hearing lots of negativity about this movie. I think a lot of people have been shocked, frankly, by the raw and rough nature of the film. Having read the play, I've been looking forward to it for about a year now, and it's honestly one of the best plays I've ever read. Mike Nichols presents it in an amazing way, very faithful to the words as they're written (and they should be, for the movie is also written by the man who wrote the play, the brilliant Patrick Marber).  <br /> <br />It's a brutal topic, sex and love, especially when they're combined. I thought the movie was amazing. It captured all of the vulnerability, caustic harshness, and acerbic flirtation that the play vibrated with. All of the cast brought the movie alive. It uplifts and then brings you way down, but that's the point, and yet at the end, I didn't feel depressed or saddened, just really really awake and curious. It's the feeling you get when you get \\"closer\\", I suppose.  <br /> <br />Natalie Portman, in a tour-de-force performance, is the standout by far. Maybe it's because she's the youngest, and not expected to be that awesome, but she is. Anyways, her Alice is flirty and sweet, caustic and manipulative, evasive and yet very open, sexual and gloomy all in one character. She has the best chemistry with the men - whether it be purely sensual with Clive Owen, or innocence and affection with Jude Law. She comes alive with the two guys, and their scenes are ones to look forward to. <br /> <br />Julia Roberts, whom everyone looks towards, is not bad in this film. She's very understated and good, but she is outshone in nearly every scene by whomever she's acting with.  <br /> <br />Clive Owen is absolutely astounding, and he's definitely on everyone's radar screen. As the man of experience and \\"simplicity\\", as Jude Law's character comments, he's brash and hotheaded, but also extremely clever. Owen perfectly plays the sleazy, unlikeable character, but somehow manages to appeal to the audience and even though he's a disagreeable character, I think many managed to find something all right about him - Owen's human sense in Larry.  <br /> <br />Jude Law is simply very very good; neither astounding nor bad. The only reason he does not stand out is the fact that we've all expected him to do a good performance. And he does, he has a great performance. He and Portman have amazing scenes together, and he's always on par. <br /> <br />Simply put, the movie is not for everyone (especially not for seeing with a parent or young child); it's a mature adult flick, and does not back down from anything. It's high drama - with all the uplifting romance and brutal arguments of relationships. It's a story about people.  <br /> <br />
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I'm surprised that no one seems to draw any comparisons between this movie and 'A Year And A Half In The Life Of Metallica', the documentary that followed them through the recording and subsequent touring of 'The Black Album'. James Hetfield didn't seem to mind the cameras back then, but today, in SKOM, he loathed them. To me the older documentary was more fun and entertaining, but this new one gave the band in a nice emotional depth. <br />Watching Some Kind Of Monster reminded me of how huge of a Metallica fan I used to be. Every frame of old flashback material I instantly recognized and reminded me of good times. Though this was a documentary, it was played out like a scripted move. I'm not likening it to the phoney realty TV out there, I'm saying that it flowed like a movie should, in such a way that had you guessing about the future of the band. <br />My complaint about the movie is that it felt claustrophobic. Even though it took like two years to film, the recording studio and the therapy room were the only dominant locations.Though already a long movie, I felt that it could keep on rolling Just as things were picking up from the gloom of uncertainty, the movie came to an end.
B000001C6M|3.0|that these guys at one point in their career could actually write songs! Seriously, after listing to the puke fest Reign in Blood, i thought Slayer was incapable of writting real songs, but i found a tape of SHOW NO MERCY lying around, and it was pretty good! This is the best album Slayer has ever put out, period! There are actually hooky, classic metal fueled riffs and guitar passages in here that they would fail to write for latter albums in favor of making loud, random noise. Seems King and Hannemen actaully knew how to play scales and melodies at one point, what happened? Tom sounds like a banshee, he's got these screams that are blood curdling. My favorite songs were THE ANTICHRIST, DIE BY THE SWORD, FIGHT TILL DEATH, TORMENTOR, THE FINAL COMMAND and CRIONICS. It is funny how the first album they ever put out would ultimatly be their best, HELL AWAITS sounds like a jack hammer in a trash can and RIB is vomit to the ears. For the people who think Slayer are crap (which they are), you should listen to this, they actually were pretty decent on this one.
078401213X|1.0|Just saw this, recorded from TV. Interesting for a while, but the repetition of the images and sounds finally turned me off - you don't have to show me the same things 50 times to make a point - wore me out, finally, and I zipped forward, just to see how it ended. It ended by me erasing the whole thing. Glad I didn't rent it. I have to agree with the negative comments already made.
0689862725|5.0|I was shocked to realize this short novel has become my favorite Stephen King work.  While it doesn't have the breathtaking scope of The Stand, it could be his most human horror story to date.  I don't say this lightly, either--King, in my opinion, is the master of humanizing horror.<br /><br />It's wonderful to see how King's style has evolved over the years.  Compare this work to the first book in the Gunslinger saga, and you'll be shocked.  While I understand that some might prefer his younger, more edgy tales, I find The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon to be the perfect meeting of the anger and fear of youth and the contentment and satisfaction of proud middle age.
B000053VAF|2.0|I loved Kevin Smith's first two movies Clerks and Mallrats. Chasing Amy was okay, but a little too much of a downer in the end.  <br />Now get this, Dogma seems to be the movie that is the line in the sand for a lot of people. The majority of Clerks/ Mallrats fans didn't care much for Dogma, and vice-versa for the Dogma fans (but not completely, a good number of Dogma fans hadn't even heard of Smith's prior movies). <br />It's been said that this movie slams the church, but it's just a slanted view on Catholisism that hard liner religous fanatics might find offensive. A lot of the comedy in this movie THINKS that it's offensive. I remember bits on the news discussing Dogma's ramifications, but it all just felt like manufactured drama and debate to me (i.e. publicity stunt). <br />Throwing Jay and Silent Bob in the mix really messed up the flow and 'believability' of it all, especially when the first three movies had them tied together to a specific area. <br />What I don't get is where Smith got all this Hollywood clout. His previous films were good, but were cast with several before-they-were-stars. In Dogma, suddenly all these big names appeared in the credits, and would the general audience found the movie as good without the injected star-power? Did he make a deal with the devil?

I love SOAD and I was looking forward to this much-hyped release, but, like all good things, SOAD must end. I hate this album and whoever's idea it was to let Daron sing should be shot. I'd rather slam my dong in the microwave than put this into any CD player again. It also has the lamest cover art ever. Period. I have reported this album to the Consumer Products Safety Commission because I feel that it is unsafe and it could cause injury or death. These guys are retarded for thinking that this would be a decent release. I hope that one day at a concert, when their short, yellow tour bus parks in a handicap spot at an arena, that someone slashes the tires, steals the stereo and their equipment, smashes the windows, and seals the bus doors shut so SOAD can never record, release, or perform another song ever and they have to eat each other and their own sh*t to survive. Damn, I hate SOAD.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|About fourteen years ago, I took my two small granddaughters to see the stage play of the Phantom.  The youngest being only two, I thought it wouldn't make a big impression on her but through the years they listened to the music, talked about the stage show constantly and pretended to be Christine.  My greatest hope was that someday Andrew Lloyd Webber would transfer this touching story to the screen.  I waited patiently and my patience was rewarded!  For the first time, I own my own copy of this beautiful movie which was perfectly cast in my opinion.  I took the girls and their 7 year old younger sister to see the movie and the youngest's only request was that she could have the music CD for her own.  I not only suprised her with it for Easter this year but for her birthday, I surprised her with her own DVD of the movie.  She watches it everyday and her sister's have to bargain with her to see the movie again!  What a great accomplishment!  Thanks, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, and not to mention the entire cast who brought my dream to the screen for me to watch over and over.  I truly appreciate it!

B00006FR47|5.0|Given the transitional nature of Chicago V, I can't imagine that all diehard fans of the more poppy Chicago material and all diehard fans of the first three recordings would like it, although there must be some overlap.  As a huge fan of the first three recordings (and as a bassist), I feel that Chicago V (1972) along with their 1969 debut (Chicago Transit Authority), II, III, and the live recording IV, defines a period where the band was at a creative peak.  Although there are the (so-called) \\"pop\\" hits \\"Saturday in the Park\\", \\"Dialogue Pts I and II\\", and I suppose to some extent \\"All is Well\\", Chicago V is far from being a pop vehicle.  Instead, the music seamlessly bridges the gap between their smash hits and the wild, full-throttle acid jazz-rock of 69-71.  Specifically, the \\"big band\\" type arrangements on V (nearly all of which were written by Robert Lamm) sacrifice none of the instrumental virtuosity or experimentation of earlier works, although the pieces are somewhat shorter and presented in a tighter, more cohesive format.  For example, there are no lengthy song-cycle suites or extended guitar solos.  It does not however, take a careful listener to appreciate the sheer complexity of the arrangements on V, which emphasize dense ensemble work, odd time signatures (the waltzy 3/4 and 6/8 are used quite a lot, amongst others), and unusual chord voicings, in addition to the wide stylistic range of the music, which runs the gamut from the gospel-ish vocal parts on Alma Mater, to the awesome jazz-rock of \\"State of the Union\\" and \\"Goodbye\\".  All of the musicians are absolutely top shelf and Peter Cetera is unquestionably the most under-rated bass player in all of rock.  In fact, he is one of the few rock bassists that can play a convincing walking bass line.  All in all, this recording (including the bonus tracks) makes a nice bookend at the conclusion of a five-album sequence of incredible music written during 1969-1972 that is also indicative of future trends.  As a fan of both jazz-rock and progressive rock, Chicago V works for me on a number of levels and is highly recommended along with CTA, II, III, and IV.s a fan of both jazz-rock and progressive rock, Chicago V works for me on a number of levels and is highly recommended along with CTA, II, III, and IV.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I was first turned on to Franz Ferdinand when they were on tour with Interpol last year. I am a big Interpol fan, but I really got into FF from the first time I listened to them play. <br /> <br />FF is an import from Glasgow, Scotland, and they are talented as hell. The guitar driven, fast paced drum beats and melodious lyrics are phenomonal. It has that lo-fi garage sound to it that feels raw and unbridled. <br />  <br />I think that if you really like the Strokes, Interpol, Joy Division, etc. you will like this album a lot. There are no filler songs on this album. Each and every song is awesome. This album puts me in a good mood every time I listen to it. I like to listen to FF when I am running because it is catchy and fast paced. When I am listening to them, I totally forget that I am running. So, purchase this album and Good Luck. I hope that you will love it as much as I have. <br /> <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I live the typical big city life and the work days just blend into each other. I have had three breakups in three months. <br /> <br />This movie I saw for the first time over the weekend. Even though it's really a chick flick I find it to be so powerful and magical. I remember what true love is like even in ups downs and arounds. Nicole and Ewan are perfect together. <br /> <br />This is a great old kind of Hollywood movie with new visuals and sounds.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I initially viewed this film at the cinema and consequently went a further 4 times! and, on the strength of the film went to the West End to see the theatre production which is outstanding also. <br /> <br />The extras on the 2 disc DVD purchaed from the excellent Amazon are good and give further insight into the making of this masterpiece. This is one of those rare films that really could not be improved upon. It is pure and utter genius. The casting is absolutely precise. I had never heard of much of the cast (it is so refreshing that like myself, they are young!) but wow, what a collection of talent. Gerry Butler puts his heart and sole into this role as do all the others and the result is really something not to be missed.  <br /> <br />The entire film is faultless. The music is penetratingly exquisit with a depth and clarity that adds to the ambiance of the plot. <br /> <br />The choriographed scenes such as masquerade are breath taking. <br /> <br />I found the film extremely imotive. The first time I saw this film I am not ashamed to say that I was weeping at the end! Everyone can relate to at least one of the characters.  <br /> <br />If any of the cast read this then all I can say is thankyou for such excellence and to the director, Joel Shumacker and Sir Andrew...UTTER RESPECT!!!!
B0001WTUH6|1.0|This movie was completely stupid and crap. I have watched and owned it, but I got rid of it finally. The movie makes little to no sense and is just plainly boring and would drive death to suicide. It is mostly in it for the straight male society. Buy Blade. Seriously.
B000002J03|5.0|ok lets be honest here led zeppelin is one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time. the reason for that is because you have an awsome combo, you have jimmy page's amazing guitar work involving very catchy riff's and insaine solo's to top it all off. but this cd is one of their best, i mean if you have the songs &quot;whole lotta love&quot;, &quot;heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;living loving maid&quot;, and the rest of the songs on that cd it's probably a greatest hits, but this one isn't. you should go out and buy it if you don't already have it. you'll love it.
B00005JNQ8|5.0|\\"The Interpreter\\", the brilliant new political thriller directed by Sydney Pollock, marks, among others, the most violent film to ever recieve a    PG-13 rating. It's not grossly violent, and it isn't dominated by blood soaked action sequences, it's just suprisingly bloody, and you don't expect it to be. It's not like I have never seen a bloody PG-13 movie (\\"XXX\\" or \\"Spiderman 2\\"), it's just that when you see a movie that kids are seeing in the same show as you, you don't really expect to see a person shot and see blood spurt. It doesn't take anything away from the movie though, which for all of its running time remains a suspensful and fairly frightening thriller. The acting is top-notch, and Sean Penn does a great acting job, probably his best since \\"Mystic River\\". Katherine Keener, playing Penn's partner, has not yet retired from her token role as comic relief sidekick, but she does a very good job with her role. The settings are great, and most of the movie takes place in either Greenwich Village, or the Upper East Side. The settings are appropriately claustrophbic, but colorful and cozy. Nicole Kidman does an excellent job as the title character. Now, I guess it goes without saying that Sydney Pollock, who has what is known moreover as a glorified cameo, does the sequences of characters talking much better than the action sequences. The set piece, I guess, actually comes in the middle of the movie, when an assassin comes to kill Nicole Kidman, and Penn is involved in a five minute gun fight with him. What makes the scene all the better is that the assassin is never seen by Penn, so he must shoot towards the noises he hears. This adds a probability to the movie that the rest of the movie does not have so good. The talking set piece, however, is a sequence that dominates the first act of the film. It is a twenty minute conversation between Kidman and Penn. The movie has several scenes that don't really need to be there, like the scenes between the technician thatKidman works with. He acts creepy and we all think that it may lead somewhere, but it never does, and he plays a tiny part, if any, in the climax. There are also many scenes, like the one where Penn explains his gruffness and uses an old African ritual as a example, that work beyond working ability.  <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, a U.N. interpreter who grew up in Africa. She has had a tortured childhood, with her family (her parents and little sister) being blown up by a land mine. She grew up with her brother, Simon (Hugo Speer), who is a person who frequents soccer stadiums and peace rally's. Silvia moved to New York because she \\"did not want to stand on the side of the road with a machine gun\\". She interprets the African region in the U.N. into English. She has a lonely life, living alone in a pretty large apartment in, if you have not yet figured it out, New York.She has African relics around her house, to remind her of Africa and her only remaining relative. The plot begins when Silvia goes back to her booth late at night and overhears a plotto kill the African president, Edward Zuwanie (Earl Cameron). Nobody in America, or Africa for that matter, likes him very much because he started a genocide in Africa, single handedly killing hundreds of African's. She goes to FBI agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and his partner Dot Woods (Catherine Keener). They don't believe her, and they have about three days to do so. The problem may be that Silvia waited a day after hearing the comment to go to the police. This is because the plotters referred to him as \\"Our Father\\", and so did a man that Silvia interviewed the next day. Stranagely, he is never considered a suspect. Everyone, except for this guy, is considered a suspect, since nobody likes him very much, as I stated before.  <br /> <br />The climax to the film is well done and very intense, and the writers, Martin Stellman and Brian Ward, generously devote the third act to setting up the pivitol scene. The end of the movie is done very well, and is at one moment intense and the next sweet and caring. Althought the movie runs for a rather lengthy 135 minutes, it does not feel that long. It feels more in the 90 minute range. It may be because the film is so interesting and rather seminal in a strange, weird way. Although the movie does get a little crazy in terms of violence in the middle, it never feels overdone or like it does not need to be there. It is all there for one reason or another, and it feels as if even one sequence, one minute, one second was missing, the whole movie would collapse. The film works on too many levels to describe, and this is definetely the second best film of the year (the first being \\"Crash\\"). <br /> <br /> <br />Running Time: 135 Minutes (2 Hours 15 Minutes) <br />Rated PG-13 for Violence (Stabbings, shootings, a smothering, disturbing images, kids kill men and store them in an underground soccer stadium, all have some form of blood. The film also includes an explosian that visibly kills many), Language, And Sexual Content (a strip club scene). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001Y2U|1.0|Marilyn Manson had been credited for being the most vile, evil, and disgusting person on the planet since the early 90's. Manson is just a dork that could never get attention, so he attempted to become the biggest freak. From what I know about mainstream \\"dark\\" music, this is probably one of it's most famous albums. This album is just a poser with his poser band behind him, creating music that shocked people (I don't know why, it is about as dark as Britney Spears). For true dark music, old school black metal defines it. Mayhem, Darkthrone, and Emperor are all black metal groups that make Manson look like a Christian both musically and lyrically. Manson never did anything that evil, he just did stupid props that were more \\"perverted\\" than evil. Black metal does truly evil things such as church burnings, murder, cannibalism, and occult related activity-Manson never did anything like that! So forget Manson's stupid poser goth rock, get in touch with the black metal scene for truly evil music and lifestyles.

B000022TSV|5.0|Julia Migenes-Johnson is the most wanton, flirtatious, outright outrageously sexual Carmen I have ever seen, or listened to, in Francesco Rosi's lush 1984 film adaptation of Georges Bizet's opera, \\"Carmen,\\" filmed on location in Andalusia. The casting of the fiery femme fatale is essential to the success of the opera, because the diva must be able to project femininity, defiance and sensuality, as well as a phenomenal mezzo-soprano voice in order to be believable. After training for ten months to adapt her natural soprano to the mezzo range, Ms. Migenes-Johnson brings Carmen to life in a manner which I have never seen. Opera purists may quibble because she was cast in a mezzo role - but why not, if she can sing the part? And her singing and acting are exciting...brilliant, actually! She really makes one understand the tremendous erotic attraction between Carmen and Don Jose, and why the honorable soldier fell so tragically in love with her.<br /><br />Italian tenor, Placido Domingo, excels as Don Jose, the sincere army corporal who becomes obsessed with love for the feckless gypsy woman. Domingo's voice is in top form here, and he is convincing and absolutely dashing, in what I believe is his finest screen performance. The supporting cast is superb - especially bass Ruggero Raimondi, who plays suave Escamillo, the tor&eacute;ador who competes for Carmen's affections; and Faith Esham, as Micaëla, Don Jos&eacute;'s lovely and loyal hometown sweetheart. Those who act the parts of Spanish peasants and gypsies, really add to the illusion of reality. The music, performed by the Orchestre National de France, conducted by Lorin Maazel, is first rate, of course.<br /><br />This famous nineteenth-century opera was originally based upon a novella by Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. The story is about a poor and honest soldier who is seduced by a sensuous gypsy. His love for her becomes his eventual downfall when she abandons him for a lauded toreador. The opera was looked upon as scandalous, tres risque, for the period. When it premiered, it was called \\"sordid\\" and \\"unmelodic.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bizet's Carmen,\\" (as this film is titled in the US), is first and foremost an opera film - and so much more than a live recording of a static stage performance. This highly energetic production was shot almost entirely in southern Spain. The real sceneries, (no artificial stage sets), are shot outdoors and feature beautiful pastoral landscapes, as well as those drenched by the southern sun, the bull fight arena, and colorful gypsy camps, lending an extraordinarily rich and open atmosphere to the movie. Pasqualino De Santis' cinematography captures the settings perfectly - and his opening shots of the bull fight are exquisite and powerful. Also, Bizet's original dialogue is used, as he meant it to be, (and is well translated with English subtitles), which makes the opera more accessible to audiences. For a period, after Bizet's death, recitatives were written and commonly used in the opera's performances rather than dialogue.<br /><br />One does not need to be an opera aficionado to appreciate this compelling film and become caught up in the drama and the glorious music. This is one of the first operas I watched all the way through, and I found myself riveted to the screen. I became motivated to explore other operas after enjoying this one so much, and bought the VHS tape back in the mid-1980's. I recently purchased the DVD. The only extras are two trailers. The first is of \\"Carmen\\" and the second, \\"The Dream Life of Angels,\\"  which is an excellent film, but I don't understand its relevance here. I'm not complaining, mind you.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough. The performances are outstanding and extremely realistic. This is a work of art to be enjoyed by the novice and opera connoisseur alike.<br /><br />JANAsque, for the period.

0671449028|5.0|I've read this to our little girl since she was one year old. She loves the pictures, likes to name the animals, point to the moon, etc. Now that she's two, we're using it to spell out the whole \\"going to bed\\" routine -- bath, pajamas, brush teeth, exercise, sleep. ESPECIALLY the \\"brush their teeth\\" part.<br /><br />But there are times that I can't get her calmed down unless I have the lights completely off. The verse is so simple, I've memorized it and can just recite it to her, with fast results.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|What the hell's wrong with all those morons trashing System?! <br />If you disagree with their political views WHY THE HELL DO YOU LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC? Daron drives a Hummer but Serj is the activist and the one behind the anti-bush stuff. So Daron doesn't sound like Serj, of course not, NOBODY DOES! Leave the guy alone, he's an ok singer. This is a great cd: all the songs are awesome and the lyrics are as good as ever. <br />If System Of A Down is too much for you to handle maybe you should try Britney Spears, losers!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNTV|5.0|Nancy - that woman on the cover - she's just a nice, honest girl who takes off her clothes for a living. Just about no one else is that easy to place.<br /><br />This movie is the best in a lot of different directions. For one, it's at the top of the new noir. Everything and everyone has a dark edge; the good guys have a bad edge, and the bad guys have a really bad edge, and some of them are just over over the edge. Just about every scene is night, a dark time for the dark businesses of murder and revenge. And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.<br /><br />It's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever. The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co-director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done. The actors put in some memorable performances, too - Elijah Wood's \\"Kevin\\" is no hobbit, not even a little. The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.<br /><br />This is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen. It's black and white, with the emphasis on the black - like the characters themselves, there's not a lot of gray in the middle. That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick. Goldie's hair, Cindy's eyes, that yellow b*st*rd, and blood. Lots of blood. Sometimes, though the blood turns black as death, or glows white like molten metal - the color (or lack) conveys the mood better than literality ever could.<br /><br />It's not for the squeamish, though. The hookers and strippers do their work out of sight, but the violence gets pretty raw. It's a raw story, though.<br /><br />And it's great. It's not at literate as the Maltese Falcon, maybe, but it's a comic book, and great within its kind.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0345360338|5.0|Falls the Shadow is the second book in Penman's Welsh trilogy. However, like the first one--Here Be Dragons--this epic book can stand alone by itself. In this book, we follow the rise of Simon de Monfort, a man who acquires an Earldom for himself. He falls in love with Nell, King Henry's sister, and the two marry despite disapproval. Simon becomes a Reformer, trying to change England's laws that greatly favor the nobility. Also in this book--although not mentioned as much--is the story of Wales. Llewelyn Fawr's son Davydd and son Gryffyd are predictably at war. This war ends up pitting brother against brother; father against son.<br /><br />Once again, Penman does a remarkable job of mixing facts with fiction. The battle-scenes are grusomely real; this book certainly won't be mistaken for a Romance novel. Especially interesting to me were the court intrigues. Although this book is long (almost 600 pages), it is well worth it!
B00005JMJG|5.0|I recently rented this with Spanglish. Wow this movie is about as perfect as you can get for a movie. I am no serious movie critic but this had great direction,visuals, and acting. The movie was about two people who erased there memory of the other and ended up for falling each other in the end. The movie takes you deep in to the mind of Joel(Carrey) and his thoughts of his girlfriend Clementine(Winslet) and he tries to escape from his mind. He is erasing her but does not want to. Every thing in his mind goes slowly for his love for Clementine. He wants her memories to stay with him. She had her mind erased from him and a guy named Patrick who helped erase it was getting to fall for Clementine.Clementine could feel the thoughts by Joel but did not know about it. Joel got his mind erased of her. Then they met and fell in love with each other at the end. <br />Acting-10 out of 10 <br />Direction-10 out of 10 perfect <br />Visuals-10 out of 10 <br />Story-10 out of 10 <br />Entertaining-10 out of 10
B000003S0D|5.0|My five stars is for the first side, the second is garbage.  But, well it should be apparent that the rest is quite magnificent!  My first idea of the album is that it's the most basically enjoyable of all crimso  albums.  In the Court of the Crimson King was mostly some sort of solemn/mystical/despairing concept?  That required too much attention to be easy, In the wake of Poseidon was hard to enjoy because of the somewhat strained replication of it's predecessor. About now we should get it straight that I find everything from the time Adrian Belew joined to present completely repulsive, as it stands Belew is perhaps the man I hate most on Earth.  So, but Islands was rather too reflective and unstructured, not enough of a focused idea, so that didn't work out... and Larks' tongues was rather too inconstant as well, Sttarless and Bible black was nearly, nearly a concise effort, but some of the pieces were of lower quality than others and, basically the whole thing was too desperate for easier listening.  Red was nearly perfect as well.  <br />So, but now that you've endured my partial history lesson, I'll treat you to some opinions.  Lizard is simply theie happiest production, I have the sensation that they were very content with the situation of making it...  Actually this isn't an impression, this is quite factual, Crimson King Robert Fripp announced it upon the close of that era, but I digress.  So, they were as a group at that time greatly content and so things went in a rather... in a more uplifting direction.  It's plain to me at least.  Of course I can easily say that it is, as you've been told, the jazziest and most experimental of their works, as well as the most unperfected, which I enjoy.  Though, you may be scowling at what I've said, remarking to yourself or someone else whom I don't know that it is NOT in factuality a very happy album.  And that's true, Cirkus is actually quite frightening, and Happy Family greatly unsettles me, especially the end, theend scares the devil out of me, always has!  But even if the material is sad or hypnotic or whatever you like, I don't mean that, the band was happy with making it, and when the artist is happy, I imagine that the art is guaranteed to be of a sinsiterly beautiful achievement.   <br />Now, I close with the apology that I'm incapable of a valuable review, please accept it!
B000002U8G|4.0|With Meddle (pronounced \\"Medley\\") Pink Floyd came of age musically, completing their transition from psychedelic experiments to a mature but innovative rock sound.  This album will delight lovers of chill-out music as well as Pink Floyd fans.    Side 1 contains two gems: \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" and \\"Fearless\\".  The former is a musical poem whose grace is complemented by the interplay between David Gilmour's voice and guitar phrases.  \\"Fearless\\" meanwhile has the quality of a parable, hinting at a secret behind its casualness.    It is however \\"Echoes\\", the epic that occupies the whole of Side 2 of the original, that is the heart of the album and the main reason for buying it.  This piece showcases the band as composers at the height of their powers, albeit funny looking ones (see Pink Floyd perform \\"Echoes\\" in the video \\"Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii\\").  All four band members feature prominently, but it is the Rick Wright's synthesized passages and the liquid purity of David Gilmour's guitar playing that most stand out.  This beautiful and well structured piece shimmers and glitters like ripples in the sun:    \\"Cloudless every day you fall upon my waking eyes  Inviting and inciting me to rise  And through the window in the wall  Come streaming in on sunlit wings  A million bright ambassadors of morning.\\"
B0007GAERG|5.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is labeled Mariah Carey's comeback album and \\"the return of the voice\\".  I am Mariah's #1 fan, I would go aganist anyone...I personally own over 60 of her CDs ranging from Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, Australia to Malaysia.  There is something different about this album.  While \\"Charmbracelet\\" was a great album lycially, it didn't hit the spot vocally.  Mariah has THE VOICE and on \\"Emancipation\\", she uses it.  We all should call JD and thank him for telling Mariah she needs to get back to her roots.  The lead single, \\"It's Like That\\" could rival any Jennifer Lopez song anyday.  While the track only made it to #16 on the Billboard's Hot 100 chart, this is A LOT better than \\"Through The Rain\\" which peaked at #81.  \\"It's Like That\\" is catchy...if you ask me, it is an instant MAriah classic.  The song did reach #1 on Billboard's Hot Club Play and Club Sales charts.  The second single, \\"We Belong Together\\" is a ballad and Mariah sings on it.  So far it has reached #2 on Billboard's Hot 100, her last #2 was 2001's \\"Loverboy\\" and \\"I Know What You Want\\" made it to #3 in 2003.  \\"We Belong Together\\" has reached #1 on Billboards Pop Airplay chart, with over 164 million spins.  This is Mariah's first #1 on the chart since 1995's \\"One Sweet Day\\" which stayed there for an amazing 13 weeks.  I do believe \\"We Belong Together\\" will be Mariah's 16th #1 on the Billboard's Hot 100 chart.  The song would be #1 now if it wasn't for weak downloads.  The 3rd single from \\"Emancipation\\" is \\"Shake It Off\\".  When I heard the news of this, I thought...\\"What are you doing Mariah?!?!\\"  Don't get me wrong, it is a good song, but \\"Say Somethin'\\" with Snoop Dogg and \\"To The Floor\\" with Nelly seems like a better road to take, but she might be saving those for the summer so it could be a huge summer hit.  \\"Shake It Off\\" is about getting over a false love.  It has a good bass line and is once again produced by the great JD.  I heard the last second of a remix to \\"Shake It Off\\"the other night and it was really hot.  I am hoping I am wrong about \\"Shake It Off\\" and will see it at the top of the charts where Mariah belongs.  The whole album is full of great songs.  A personal favorite is \\"Stay The Night\\".  Mariah's voice is so beautiful here as it is everywhere.  When she hits those notes, makes ya melt like butta...Another great track is \\"One And Only\\" with Twista.  I've never been a fan of Twista, but here he is a great addition.  Mariah uses some strong language here...\\"I'm riding home in pain again baby/but that don't s**t to you...I gotta know he wont betray my trust/Just like every other motherf**ker does...\\"  But as Mariah always does, she edits her self out.  On \\"Say Somethin'\\" she sings...\\"Both painting pictures of/how we'll kiss and f**k...\\".  While I was waiting for April 12th to get here, I read so many reviews on the album.  A lot of them noted \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" to be a strong vocal performance, but I think other songs are stronger.  For the first half of \\"Bird\\", she is whispering again, then when the chorus comes in the second time, she lets go and it is beautiful.  \\"Your Girl\\" is a sexy, 70's sounding song.  To me, it sounds like a Jackson 5 song.  \\"Joy Ride\\" is a beautifuuly written song, but I personally would have liked stronger vocals here, but like normal, in the second part of the song, she lets go.  The ending is amazing.  \\"Circles\\" is another favorite.  A lot of people can relate to it.  If you have had an ex-lover and you can't get over that person, here is a song for you!...\\"You got me runnin' around in circles over you...\\"  \\"Get Your Number\\" is a great dance song.  JD out does Nelly here.  He actually sings and he is not bad at all.  Someone said in a review, JD over shines Mariah here...Um, sorry JD, I like ya and all, but you can never out shine the QUEEN!!  Mariah uses her voice like on past hits \\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Honey\\".  Great bass line and great vocals.  \\"I Wish You Knew\\" is a good song, not a favorite, but a good addition.  If you've ever fallen in love with someoe and they didn't know...here ya go.  It kind of reminds me of \\"All I've Ever Wanted\\" from 1993's diamond \\"Music Box\\".  And lasty, \\"Mine Again\\".  This is another great vocal performance here.  MC's voice soars here and it is amazing.  If you have had a lover leave you and you want them back...here ya go.  All-in-all, this is the best album of the year, hands down.  This is one of Mimi's best albums to date.  The album debuted at #1 with over 404,000 copies sold in it's first week, a new all-time high for the Lovely Miss M.  For the next 3 weeks, it holds strong at #2 and in it's 5th week, falls to #3 on the Billborad 200 Albums chart.  By it's 4th week, \\"Emancipation\\" sold over 1 million copies and it showing no sign of slowing.  \\"J.Lo\\" should be at home crying and wondering her musical future...her lastest album \\"Rebirth\\" only made it to #2 on the 200 Albums Chart.  MC sold more in her first week than Jennifer Lopez did in a month.  It is't 11th week on the charts, J.Lo's \\"Rebirth\\" sits at #91 on the album charts.  People can see through a fake artist.  If you have not bought \\"Rebirth\\" GREAT, don't...If you have not bought \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\"...WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!?!  You must buy this CD now!!  This is such a great album, even if you are not a fan of MC, you would like it.  There is something here for everyone...So run...Buy a few copies...
B0007Z4S4C|3.0|This album might be as good as the other reviews. I have not opened my copy. Why? Because I didn't know it came in a mini sleeve. And it's such a thin one that it would vanish in my cd cabinet. I have no problem with lp replicas, but give us the option. Offer these things in both the mini sleve, or digi pak and in jewel box. I still have jewel boxes from 1984. but all the digi paks I have from that early have deteriorated. I am checking in the UK and Canada for a jewel box version.

B000002KXV|5.0|Being only 19 at the time of writting this, you would be forgiven if you thought that my tastes are somewhat under-developed.  Growing up with a father who played a huge variety of music since a very early age, I'd like to think I got off a head start.  Broadening my horizons with many various bands of differing genre, Steely Dan of course were included and certainly caught my attention. After purchasing this recently, I'm blown away by how little it seems to have dated and how fresh it sounds. I am not at all suprised that people can quite happily play this regularly after so long, providing it such titles as \\"masterpiece\\".    This one I hope too, will stick with me on the playlist for many years to come.  In short, this is one of the best albums I think I could add to my growing collection.

0783114222|3.0|This whole TV-series-on-DVD phenomenon's getting a bit nuts. Maybe I'm picky, or maybe I'm cheap, but I can't see myself shelling out the money to own anything unless I plan on watching it five or ten times. And although this series is enjoyable and impressive, I just can't picture myself popping it in the DVD player a second or third time. (OK, maybe a second time. But not for every episode.) And I'm a huge fan of all things Apollo.<br /><br />Perhaps if I'd watched this before reading Andrew Chaikin's \\"A Man on the Moon\\" (the main basis for this series), I'd have enjoyed it more. The nation may have only paid attention to Apollos 8, 11, and 13, but the rest of the program contained drama aplenty--Apollo 12's lightning strike, Alan Sheperd's triumphant return to space on Apollo 14, and the spectacular Lunar Rover explorations on Apollos 15, 16 and 17, to name but a few. Everyone knows that Apollo 13 didn't land on the moon; few know how close Apollos 12, 14 and 16 came to sharing the same fate. Chaikin's book excellently retells all of Apollo's forgotten epics, and \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" attempts to bring that retelling to vivid life.<br /><br />It partially succeeds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the meaty source material has been chopped up and pureed into TV-friendly nuggets; many of the best and most vivid recollections from the Chaikin book are absent or barely hinted at here. Presentation also suffers--the performances and the dialogue are solid and workmanlike, but rarely do the scenes provide enough information about the individual astronauts to really get inside their heads. After reading the book, one gets a feel for the distinct personalities of every astronaut who made the voyage, but after watching the movie, some of them come across as little more than empty spacesuits.<br /><br />Many of the creative minds involved in this production (Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Brian Grazer) are victims of their own successes on Apollo 13--that movie did such an excellent job of recreating zero-G (by filming in actual zero-G conditions on NASA training aircraft) that these mini-movies suffer in comparison, feeling like, well, mini-movies. By clever use of helium baloons, this series gives its actors the \\"bounce\\" real moonwalkers had in 1/6th gravity, but it looks like they either didn't have the time or the budget to rent NASA's \\"Vomit Comets\\" again to duplicate zero-G for the orbital portions of the miniseries.<br /><br />HBO did spend a decent amount of money on CGI, though, and it shows--perhaps too much. For a television series, the special effects are great. But some of the CGI scenes are just too crisp, too razzle-dazzle. If they'd been dirtied up just a touch, they'd have looked a lot more convincing; instead, they remind the viewer that they are watching something rather than living it.<br /><br />Anyway, the amazon.com police might not like that I'm saying this, but don't buy this, unless you really, really, really, must own all Apollo stuff, or unless you want to sweeten Tom Hanks's wallet ever-so-slightly with whatever residuals he might be getting from this DVD set. Instead, buy Andrew Chaikin's book (if you don't already have it) and then, if you're still not satisfied, make the brave voyage from the earth to the video store.such an excellent job of recreating zero-G (by filming in actual zero-G conditions on NASA training aircraft) that these mini-movies suffer in comparison, feeling like, well, mini-movies.

B00008O89K|5.0|I'm not one to normally buy soundtracks. This one is an exception. The music captured me when I first saw the movie years ago and has continued to remain in my mind ever since. It is unforgettable. <br /> <br />There are many things that make the music memorable but what strike me most is the suitability to its purpose. Conan was a warrior fantasy epic. The music that accompanies it is just as epic. Strong themes run throughout which are memorable. It has a quality of operatic grandiosity and some of the passages are no less thrilling and memorable than the \\"Flight of the Valkyries\\" or \\"Carmina Burana\\". This is BIG music and unapologetic about it. <br /> <br />Revel in it! <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Damn good album - hard riffs and all , my only complaint is that if Serj is supposed to be the main singer let him sing for 98% of the album.  It is fine having Aaron sing most of one song but not on a as many as he does. He can sing  afew backgrounds but paleeease not so much - just hope part two of the album has more serj singing ! <br /> <br />Aaron's voice just does not have the same appeal as Serj's. <br /> <br />A;sp the album is a bit short...... Should have been a half price CD as the first and last tracks are a bit of a waste......just some fluff for the album !!! <br /> <br />Other wise i would have gibven the album a 4.5 or even a 5

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have never seen the Phantom of the Opera anywhere at all, have never read the book.  But I have heard of the wonderful music of this production, and couldn't wait to watch it on the big screen.  I wasn't disappointed at all, unlike some of the reviewers here - I think it's because I approached this movie with fresh eyes.  Emmy Rossum's voice was clear and beautiful, and apart from a few errors that my chorus teacher would cringe at the movie was spectacular.  I could feel the characters' emotions (even though I didn't like Christine's indecisiveness).  The movie drew me in with its story and its gorgeous sets and costumes.  I felt that Butler played the Phantom very well, dark and sensual.  You should watch this movie and then watch the play; if the play really is better than the movie then it'll probably spoil it for you.  The movie itself is wonderful.
B0007P3582|3.0|The Massacre is in the same vein that 50 Cent made with his mainstream debut, Get Rich or Die Trying. the appealing gangsta swagger, drug hustling, gang, and clubbing lyrics.  That's just its problem - The Massacre brings nothing new to the table that 50 had before, just a lot more. There are 21 tracks of straight rapping, no skits breaking it up, just straight Hennessey, coke and bitches.  Same old, same old, it gets boring.  He can rap for sure, his rhymes are better than ever.  Still, why listen to this when I can listen to Get Rich and Die Trying.  There are some good tracks that I like, such as \\"Piggy Bank\\" with an almost monumental chorus, the speeding Gatman and Robbin', and of course A Baltimore Love Thing.  Still, not as enjoyable or new as Get Rich was.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|People are still lost in the Matrix...Forget about the Matrix! Forget about the fact that this was taken from a comic book and comparing it to that! This in fact was a very good movie and the only reason it got bad reviews was because of the nerdy comic book guys that can't seem to step out of that reality.... I never read the comic book and I did'nt think the matrix was all that great, in fact I thought this movie was way better then the matrix sequals... <br />Special Effects were kewl, alot of action from the start....
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent's \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" is, over all, a great album.  His  \\"gangsta\\" attitude and confident swagger make give him undeniable appeal.  It's a good listen with great production, opening with his now famous and much parodied g-unit calls, following immediately with \\"Patiently Waiting,\\" a track that lets loose some emotion.  That's my only problem with 50 Cents, he raps in the same tone for almost the whole album, never with any agility.  That's just a matter of preference, it's a good record and perfect for breaking him into the mainstream.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of A Down proves again and again that they can consistently make great albums.  It took a while for me to get into them since Toxicity came out, their vocal style was new and original.  But it was the fact that they simply rock, really hard, that ultimately drew me into their stuff.  They go soft, then hard, and then they bring it down again.  If you have heard any SOAD song, you know what I mean. I can't get enough of that, and as I got into them I started to really like their vocalists. <br />   <br />The soft growl and hard screaming of their vocalist and the oftentimes demented screamings of their guitarist are great, its different from all the alternative acts that want Cobain's scratchiness or all the metal bands that just scream, never sing.  Not that I'm bashing all modern alternative and metal bands, its just SOAD brings something different.  Their vocals wouldn't be half as good if it weren't for their lyrics.  No other band can pull off lines like \\"gonorrhea gorgonzola\\" without seeming gimmicky or corny to me.   <br /> <br />They are demented yet serious, tackling the War on Iraq, the state of the media, where do we go when we die.  They reference things such as Catcher in the Rye, its great.  The whole album rocks hard, ending in the perfect closer: a slow song unlike everything else on the album.  It appears to be monumental or uplifting until you hear what he is saying, mirroring the phoniness of its subject matter.  The monumental closer should be a sign of what is to come with Hypnotize.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|Now, I won't pretend to know what Queens of the Stone Age are all about. I'm actually writing this review out of shock from watching the video for `everybody knows that you are insane'. Its starts of with this Asian guy lying in the snow...except he's naked. That's right and I mean naked. Oh and where I come from there is no censorship so I got to see this guy in all his, albeit puny, naked glory. He proceeds to dance around, air humping at the camera which is primarily focused on his rather small appendage. When I say focused I mean a foot away. If anyone here has ever watched Italian (or indeed European) porn, you'll know what I mean when a say it gets pretty close for comfort. Well this guy has his fun: playing his penis like a guitar, rolling around with a big stuffed animal and then finally takes a shower and bends over and, yeah, the camera zooms straight up his butt. By the time the video ends I'm left staring stupefied at the screen. It doesn't help that it's the Spanish rock charts and My Chemical Romance come on next. My brain can hardly register the mind-bending change of scenery; going from an ugly, girly, Asian man with the tiniest penis I have ever seen-to-a beautiful girly Caucasian man (who I'm sure doesn't have one). I guess they both lose out on masculinity. But anyway, due to that amusing yet grotesque video I have decided to take an interest in Queens of the Stone Age, and when I'm asked how I got into the band, I'll have a very interesting story to tell.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|First of all the album is consistent with every piece they have come out with.  Second, um..the amazon review says that \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" was the first single, wrong...it was \\"Cigaro\\".  Next they mention on the opening of \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" Serj is the one screaming \\"Why do they always send the poor?\\", it was Daron that you are hearing, I was at the concert, I know.   <br />   I don't see how many people are ripping Daron for singing on so many tracks.  You begin to hear a little from him on Toxicity, now he is the writing lots of the songs.  I think he just adds eccentricity to the album.  How funny is the first line of \\"Old School Hollywood\\", \\"Tony Danza cuts in line\\".   <br />   Simply put, the album is excellent.  The anti-war protests like B.Y.O.B. and Sad Statue are great examples of their message.  If you want consistency, go buy this album!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I don't know about you but, when I heard that line I resigned myself to the fact that system had done it again: Produced a fantastic song with anti-war charged lyrics. I have noticed a couple a reviewers complaining at yet another political album, bush bashing etc. If you owned all the other releases of system of a down you should have twigged that all their cds contain anti war and anti America themes. I myself can't blame them. They have always echoed the thoughts and opinions of every country besides America (A nation that needs to be humbled I think). On regard to their latest offering, I have to say I'm disappointed. I feel that they have lost their character somewhat, due the fact that Serj takes the back seat, while Daron exercises his talents of the mike, which, although pleasing when harmonising with Serj, sound absolutely dreadful on their own. I'm not saying he can't sing, only that the main aspect of system that have always appealed to me the most were Serj's insane vocals. Songs sung in the style of   Suite-Pee, know, Darts and Bounce have always been my favourite, which is probably why no album has yet surpassed the greatness of their self titled in my opinion. I'm not against bands evolving and if this is the path they have decided to take, so be it, it's just not that appealing to me.  If you're looking for a slightly softer, more melodious system, with plenty of harmonising and cleaner vocals then this is the album for you. Some instrumental parts have a decidedly more folklore flavour to them, especially the ending to Radio/video, which is nice to hear. I guess I just can't get enough of their self titled and steal this album, which I like better then Toxicity, just so you know my tastes. But whether you enjoy this album or not, I think it's entirely a matter of personal SOAD style preference.  Well that concludes my review; I'll leave you with some SOAD lyrics to ponder over.      We fought your wars with all our hearts,  You sent us back in bodyparts,  You took our wills with the truth you stole,  We offer prayers for your long lost soul.    The remainder is,  An unjustifiable, egotistical, power struggle,  At the expense of the American Dream,  Of the American dream, of the American, of the American.    We don't give a damn about your world,  With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,  We don't give a damn about your world,  Right now, right now.     -A.D.D. (American Dream Denial)    *Updated 17 hours later*    No I've changed my mind, this album is awful. Feel free to click the none helpful vote because you disagree, I don't care. I'm too upset. I realized I was kidding myself. Its not just a matter of preference, I thought that this album was going to become my least favorite SOAD album, but that I would still get  enjoyment out of it. No, it's not happening. I've been listening to it, and I've finally realized that I hate it and can't bring my self to listen to it anymore. I put the self titled back into my Discman and attempted to wash away the awful discomfort you get when the band you love mutate into something you just cant stand listening to. I'm very unhappy about this, I never thought I'd have I bad thing to say about system in my life but well here it is, I can hardly believe it.  The only redeeming thing on this album is the music and the brief vocals of Serj. The main vocals of Daron are horrible and the lyrics are atrocious. I've been comparing the booklet to old system of a down lyrics and there is just no comparison. These guys used to be deep, and not all their songs were so hell bent on government issues, or perhaps they just weren't so *obvious*. I remember the time when fans could think of at least 20 different meanings for each song. But now, well, the inspiration has all dried up. I'm just praying that hypnotize is a return to form. If it's as bad as this I might just throw myself out the window.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have been a fan of Mariah Carey's since her debut album. Even at the tender age of nine I had great taste :). Anyway, it's so great to see that my favorite singer is back on top although she will forever remain number one in my book. As for the voice: I honestly believe that the \\"lackluster\\" album Charmbracelet (I liked it)was a clever marketing/publicity ploy. With the onset of that album came the rumors that Mariah had irrevocably lost her voice  and this is the reason why she was forced to hold back vocally on the last album. Well, I guess she fooled a lot of people because on Emancipation of Mimi her voice is as strong and powerful as ever. And because she actually Sings on this album more and more people bought the album,which put her right back on top. Great job Mariah! Anyway, I hope her next single is either. One and Only or Stay the Night. Those and We Belong Together are the best ones!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I used to like system of a down, and I also bought into the hype of their new cd. I heard the 2 singles on the radio,\\"BYOB\\" and \\"Cigaro\\" and those songs seemed to be good. However, after hearing the album those 2 are the only decent songs on the whole thing!  Not to mention their lyrics are just stupid.  I think this is by far their worst work yet and if you realy like the radio hits I would suggest you download them. Then maybe these guys will get the message, that they have to start writing better stuff!
B000002AS3|4.0|I have recently bought Oasis's Definitely Maybe album as a DUAL-CD, where one side of the CD is the album and the other side is a DVD.  The DVD stuff is pretty cool and hilarious at times, especially with this one crazy British guy, who keeps on flipping-out during the interviews.  Definitely Maybe is a great album to own, but you know...I always had one problem with it and that is the recording quality itself.  The album just sounds muffled!  I can't believe recordings from the early 90's already sound a bit primitive now a days, even though they are on CD's.  I began to notice this with a lot of my albums from the early and mid 90's.  Although, I think Definitely Maybe was recorder with a style/techniques that makes it sound even more muffled.  Oh well, it's still a great album and most DEFINITELY Oasis's best.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Someone once noted that had Cash told the prisoners to revolt...so tightly was the inmate audience in his sway...the guards wouldn't stand a chance. Cash and the band lay into these songs as though the sheer energy of the performance could shatter those Folsom prison walls.<br /><br />Maybe it didn't happen physically, but emotionally, it did. Cash used the scrapes he'd had occasionally with the law to connect with the inmates...he was \\"one of them\\".<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />This album is so perfectly attuned to the prisoner's experience (songs about loneliness, sorrow over the mistakes that have have put him in jail, missing loved ones, plans to break free) that singling out specific tunes for accolades seems a downright cynical act. Perhaps the highest praise I can offer is that \\"Joe Bean\\" (a 20 year old man who admits he's murdered people but feels wronged because the one he's been sentenced to death for isn't one he committed) is one of the best tunes included here...and it wasn't deemed good enough at the time to even be ON the original album. That's the level of quality you're talking about here. (Imagine if \\"She's Leaving Home\\" was an outtake from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" for an analogy.)<br /><br />LOWS:<br />The only really low spot for me is \\"Flushed from the Bathroom of your Heart\\" (with a willfully awful lyric filled with terrible metaphors) but it's surrounded by material so strong, I end up forgiving Cash for its inclusion. I'm sure he used it because it would help give the prisoners a laugh (which it did) but I can't say it does that for me. Still, the material surrounding it is so strong, I'll forgive Cash for the minor misstep.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is a gripping hour. With the opening notes of \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" You feel the way it must feel to be locked away and forgotten by society, listening as the train rolls by your cell window...knowing that they \\"keep on movin'\\" while you stay and rot. Cash takes you on a rollercoaster ride from those pits of despair all the way through to the inner freedom found only in the \\"Greystone Chapel\\" (that song penned by an actual Folsom inmate). You even file out the \\"side door\\" along with the prisoners themselves at the end. EVERY music listener should own this.the inner freedom found only in the \\"Greystone Chapel\\" (that song penned by an actual Folsom inmate).

006054094X|1.0|Spencer Wells's brilliant Journey of man book shows genetically that the Indians in both North and South America are not close to the Chinese in any last 600 years or so bit at all. This book by Menzies is a dud. This is for the poster who says he (the  poster) is Italian.
B00005JKJA|4.0|A summer camp staple during my youth was a story our counselors used to tell at night around the campfire. It involved a guest at a country estate who woke each night because of a disturbance in the courtyard. Each night he rushed to his window just in time to see a spectral presence rushing from the property and down the road. It took 20-30 minutes to tell the story as the counselor would meticulously detail all six times this occurred even though the particular events were identical. After six nights the guest devised a trap and caught the specter who turned out to be the owner of the estate. Just before dying the owner agreed to explain the how and why of his bizarre activity on the condition that the guest promise to never reveal the secret. The story ended with the explanation that the guest kept his promise and never told anybody the secret. This caused a lot of groaning around the campfire by the first year campers and laughter from those who had heard the story the year before. We felt cheated by the story but had to admire the brazen manner in which we had just been conned.     David Lynch took our old campfire story idea and made it into a feature film called \\"Mulholland Drive\\". For the first 80% of the film he constructs an elaborate and intriguing storyline which has the audience trying to guess the ending. We wonder how he can possibly tie all these disparate elements together into a coherent ending. One thing leads to another--but nothing leads anywhere.    In the end he cheats and the movie is incomplete because it was not intended to be complete. But like the campfire story we do not really feel cheated because Lynch is absolutely brazen about his cheating, he does not back away from it. Screen writing is a whole lot easier when closure is not a goal.    So don't watch this if you require a director who plays fair. But if you like a surreal dream in a highly stylized Hollywood film noir package you should enjoy this thing.     If nothing else the first 80% shows that Lynch could make a straight film as good as \\"L.A. Confidential\\" if he wanted. And it's worth watching just for the audition scene where the singer performs \\"Sixteen Reasons\\". The scene begins with a tight shot, then backs out to a POV from inside the control booth, then backs out further and reveals the booth is a prop on a sound stage. So we have a live stage performance, that morphs into a recording session, and then morphs into a movie audition. And the movie itself is inside a movie. And the whole thing is actually a dream. Are you confused yet? But this fits with the film because Lynch is telling the same story (trying to make it in Hollywood) with two different protagonists. The bubbly, optimistic Betty, with a support network and a good heart. And within Betty is the beat-up, worn-out Diane, who has abandoned all hope of success and become paranoid and vengeful.    By the way Naomi Watts is so good in this thing that it is scary.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000268QB2|5.0|I wasn't too keen on getting this CD when i first heard of the bad. And even when i heard their first single, which is undoubtedly excellent, i wasn't too sure about buying the whole CD. But finally did it and couldn't be happier.  <br /> <br />Keane are rather original in their approach (just the fact that they don't use a guitar should be enough), but they also change their mood and style considerably for some of the songs. The best i can think of of how to describe Keane is to mix Coldplay, Radiohead and a tad bit of Kasabian (especially on a track like Untitled), and even a tiny bit of Starsailor when it comes to the lyrics and the mood. Somewhere Only We Know, Untitled, Bedshaped, She Has No Time, Sunshine are all fabulous, unforgettable and just simply never get old no matter how many times u heard them.  <br /> <br />Believe it or not, but Keane has actually managed to effectively do what unfortunately radiohead failed to do since OK Computer. They found a fine line between too much electronics and just the right amount on songs like Untitled and Bedshaped. They did it, without abandoning conventional instruments like piano, which is a backbone of their songs. This is particularly nice to see, and i hope they don't deviate too much into the \\"we're tired of our normal instruments\\" territory and  botch it up.  <br /> <br />In other words, if u like something laid back, yet catchy, a little bit depressing, yet soothing, sometimes spaced out, this is ur album. So get this album and trust me u won't get disappointed.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This film made me a Russell Crowe fan..I had put off watching this film for a long time and when I finally got to see it I was totally blown away by Crowe and the wonderful drama in the film!  Joaquin Phoenix is also to be commended for his absolutely devastating performance as well..The film draws you in and absolutely draws a ton of emotion from you..It is just a great movie!  What can I say!  Ridley Scott did a wonderful job of directing this film and the actors were perfect!  Russell Crowe was fully convincing as Maximus and you felt every bit of emotion when you watched his powerful and intense scenes..***Spoiler***I was especially moved by the scene in which he first sees his wife and son's bodies after he arrives too late to save them.. <br /> <br />The arena scenes are especially graphic and may be a turn off to some but I thought they fit well into the context of the film.  The music absolutely complements the film and the look of the film is what is so unique..This has to rank on my list of all time favorite films!!
B00009W0U4|3.0|This movie is indeed provocative and disturbing.  <br /> <br />If I lived my whole life without seeing the brutality and groteque human behavior depicted in this movie, then I would not have considered my life incomplete. <br /> <br />But I have seen the stuff in the film that some loathe, but others accept, and - yes - their effects are \\"irreversible.\\" Maybe even traumatic. <br /> <br />If you are thinking of buying this film, then I recommend that you watch the special features first -- more specifically the \\"SFX\\" section -- because it will prepare you for the gruesome scenes that ambush the viewer in the beginning of the film. <br /> <br />I personally could not watch one character bashing in another's head with a fire extinguisher (I covered my eyes, even though that kind of violence can sort of be seen on TV shows like MaxX) - and Monica Bellucci's rape and subsequent beating were particularly horrific. <br /> <br />After the film was over, I had to remind myself that it was only craft. And having one of the principles explain its special effects techniques reminded me that it was just acting and photography and computer effects. <br /> <br />Ultimately, was this all sound and fury signifying nothing? I think it did mean something. Like good art, this film is about making its audience THINK and FEEL about things we like to deny exists in the world - particularly man's inhumanity to other men and women. The world is not a pleasant place. Evil exists. <br /> <br />And Gaspar Noe the provocateur and enfant terrible makes it all painfully clear.  <br /> <br />Will I watch this movie again? Probably not.  <br /> <br />Will I recommend it to other people? I wil probably talk about it and tell people how gut wrenching it is. <br /> <br />But after all, it is just a movie...

If you haven't read this book, then I'm sorry, truly I am, because you are missing out on something that will open your eyes to see things you'll read very few other places.<br /><br />Every part of this book will open your eyes.  Take the star character's job for example.  Read about what he does, just pick up the book at your local book store and read what the star character does as a job.  Car companies really employ these people, people who do JUST what he does and so does EVERY OTHER COMPANY IN AMERICA.  That simple fact once you understand will open your eyes to things you've been blind to your whole life.<br /><br />I hope there's a sequal to this book!  I'd really like to know where Chuck's taking this.
B00007BK2N|2.0|Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like \\"Groove\\", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Awesome album.  Catchy and fun with cool lyrics that are way off the beaten path. <br />One problem: Mr. Malakian sings too much!  Serj is 100 times the vocalist.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|There is no one even in the same realm as this band. There is nothing that can even compare to the enormous purging of the mind that happens when you listen to System of a down. Mezmerize deliviers in every aspect, every realm that you could want from this band. The one thing that I think I love more then anything else is the fact that this is one of those elite bands that forces the audience to think. Nobody \\"listens\\" to anything they write, you \\"feel\\" it. You interpret it, and it becomes part of your own experience. Anyways on to the review...<br /><br /> With the exception of the intro, there is not a second of time that is wasted on this album, which is good as it comes in at a hectic 32 minutes. B.Y.O.B (Bring your own bombs) starts the record off at an almost schizophrenic pace, that sets the mood for the whole album, with the exception of \\"sad statue\\" this songs marks the anti- Bush peak of the album, (A mountain that I think more people should climb...how the hell can people be so damn blind?) Anyways.. Cigaro is another awesome song that will get stuck in your real easy, and it will find permanent residence there as well. For me the highlight of the album is \\"Violent Pornography\\" it is one of those songs that is so simplistic, so fast paced, so incredibly obvious, so catchy that is will get stuck in your head. I think it is now my favorite song from System, replacing \\"Deer dance\\" from Toxicity.<br /><br /> One thing that I think needs to be said that doesn't seem to get said enough is that, well yes, there are quirky, political juggernauts; but these guys can play! Some of the riffs that Daron comes up with blow my mind as a fellow guitarists, this is an album that defies the typical song signatures that plague everything else on the radio.  All and all, if you haven't figured it out, I love this album, and I'd recommend it to my dog, so if you don't have it, I have one question... what are you waiting for? This album, when listened to all the way through is one enormous mind Fu..eh...fornication, that I don't think anyone should go without experiencing. Thank you for your time.rough is one enormous mind Fu..eh...fornication, that I don't think anyone should go without experiencing. Thank you for your time. <br />

B000002H2H|5.0|After \\"Kill Em All\\" Metallica had released Thrash metal into the world. But there was still much too be expanded upon in terms of the thrash metal sound. Before \\"Ride The Lightning\\" the thrash metal sound was just choose a riff and play it really fast and loud. This album introduced melody too thrash and more diverse styles of riffing rather than just reppetitive strumming of a palm muted open string, which almost all of the riffs in Kill Em All contained. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Fight Fire With Fire (5/5)- Starts off with a midevil styled acoustic intro then bursts in with Metallica's Heaviest most crushing riff ever  2.Ride The Lightning (5/5)- A song about a convict being executed by the electric chair, which is the whole idea of Ride The Lightning  3.For Whom The Bell Tolls (5/5)- simple but great riffing  4.Fade To Black (5/5)- a Thrashed up ballad type song about suicide  5.Trapped Under Ice (4.5/5)- A super fast headbanger song  6.Escape (4/5)- catchy  7.Creeping Death (4/5)- an awesome riff  8.The Call Of Ktulu (3/5) A long and repetitive instrumental, my least favorite track on the album    If you like metal definitly buy this album.    If you liked this album you might also like-  Judas Priest- Screaming For Vengeance  Anthrax- Spreading The Disease  Megadeth- So Far, So Good, So What  Slayer- Hell Awaits
B000002UAF|5.0|If With The Beatles launched Beatlemania, then A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (the movie and this soundtrack) sealed it worldwide.  The first album featuring entirely original songs, AHDN marks a big step forward for The Beatles and rock and roll in a time when singers and bands sang other people's compositions.  This is the pinnacle of mid-60s British pop before the psychedelic era.<br />John Lennon dominates this album, starting with the strong opener, the self-titled AHDN, I Should Have Known Better featuring a jaunty harmonica, If I Fell and I'll Be Back (two of his sweetest ballads), the rockers Anytime At All and When I Get Home, the Wilson Pickett-inspired You Can't Do That and I'll Cry Instead, which features John's first confessional lyric (a la Dylan) expressing self-doubt.  <br />Paul offers the million-selling hit, Can't Buy Me Love, and the strong ballads, And I Love Her and the underrated Things We Said Today.  Otherwise, Paul takes a low profile.<br />The only weakness are the boy-meets-girl lyrics which were the standard of the day.  Only I'll Cry Instead suggests any maturity in the songwriting, as Dylan's full influence hadn't yet touched the band.  <br />Musically, the album's one great advance is George's introduction of the 12-string Rickbacker, whose jangly sound would be picked up by a folk quartet from L.A. later known as The Byrds.  The Their success in turn would help push The Beatles in a different direction.<br />A final note: I still prefer listening to my Parlophone vinyl in stereo than to this mono CD.  The stereo mixes are no better or worse than Help! and Rubber Soul, yet they remain officially locked in the EMI vaults.  George Martin mistakenly believed that stereo mixes were never made in 1964, but this is not so.  Perhaps one day Apple will have the good sense to re-issue this great album in stereo.
067144901X|5.0|Shakespeare knew it, and parents and other adults know it:  People love a comedy of errors. Perhaps the most delighted audience is the youngest; toddlers love hearing mistakes and correcting them.  It's a surefire hit for their certain sense of humor, and Sandra Boynton exploits this beautifully in this small board book.<br /><br />Just a few set-up lines and Boynton is ready for the book's main joke:<br /><br />\\"A cow says MOO.\\"<br /><br />\\"A sheep says BAA.\\"<br /><br />\\"Three singing pigs say LA LA LA!\\"<br /><br />\\"'No, no!' you say, 'that isn't right.<br /><br />The pigs say OINK all day and night.'\\"<br /><br />Practice your dramatic abilities and really ham it up (pun intended) when you read the singing pigs and \\"that isn't right\\" lines on pages 3 and 4. There's also some action (dogs chasing cats), and a nice quizzical conclusion: (\\"It's quiet now. What do you [underlined] say?\\")<br /><br />Boynton's familiar style is whimsical and slightly tongue-in-cheek. Her animals have very expressive, human-looking emotions, conveyed mostly through the eyes. For example, a quacking duck and a neighing horse aren't intrinsically very interesting, but when they're facing each other with similarly baffled faces, there's a subtle humor. The singing pigs, by the way, are anything but subtle. They're pizzazed out in coordinating striped pants, solid sports coats, and elegant white bow ties. They excited pigs dance in unison and hold canes in a showy vaudeville style. For a short and simple board book aimed at the very young, this is lots of fun.  For older toddlers, take a look at Boynton's counting book with a difference: \\"Hippos Go Berserk!\\"  She knows and loves her animals, and so will your little one.
B000002UAI|2.0|BEATLES FOR SALE was recorded in time for the Christmas market amid a merry-go-round of a world tour, TV appearances and BBC radio shows.  As a result, The Beatles barely had time to write anything new and relied heavily on rock and roll staples from their Cavern Club days.  The result is regarded as their weakest album, though a few gems still make it a listenable album.<br />Like A Hard Day's Night, Lennon dominates the album, writing the first three songs.  The strongest is the confessional I'm A Loser, featuring a strong dose of Bob Dylan.  Baby's In Black is another highlight and even more cynical.  Every Little Thing features a fine melody and I Don't Want To Spoil The Party is a detour into country.  <br />Paul offers I'll Follow The Sun, a decent ballad, but an oldie from the Liverpool days and What You're Doing, which fails to live up to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound.  Overall, McCartney keeps a low profile on this album.<br />Their only true collaboration, Eight Days A Week, is one of Beatlemania's less-deserving number ones.<br />The cover songs are hit and miss.  Words of Love and Rock and Roll Music are the better ones, while Mr. Moonlight and Honey Don't are the worst.  A better, heavier album would have replaced the latter (along with Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey) with their single at the time, I Feel Fine and She's A Woman, plus Leave My Kitten Alone (found on Anthology 1).<br />And like A Hard Day's Night, the original stereo mixes are missing, replaced by the servicable mono mix found on this CD.  I still prefer the stereo mixes to the mono, and pray that Apple issues them one day.
B00005JKED|2.0|I was down the nick with Ray 'contemporaneous notes' Lewis. \\"That was great. Come back tomorrow and we'll play the game again\\" said contempo. \\"I can't put my trousers back on with these cuffs. Where's the key?\\" I protested. \\"On the floor under the desk. Now get on your knees, slave\\" he snarled. There's no escaping contempo when you put on a DVD that's criminal. You immediately get the knock. I don't mean counterfeit, I'm talking about the plot. The net conclusively proves that when whitey gets up close and personal with Mr African-American, he will pay close attention to the floor. In fact, a mere flick of the wrist is enough. Not so in this Hollywood movie, of course. After getting what can only be described as a comprehensive going over from Denzel Washington for quarter of an hour, you would think Ethan Hawke would be off for an urgent appointment with a life support machine. Eschewing the usual coma, Ethan lives up to his surname by launching himself off a roof straight on the bonnet of Denzel's car. Then with a bone structure last attributed to Reed Richards, he proceeds in his police work seemingly none the worse for wear. The only film worse than this is 'Dark Blue' with a criminal performance from Kurt Russell. As Ray 'contemporaneous notes' Lewis would say: \\"get your trousers on, you're nicked!\\" It's only if you're already wearing trousers that you've got to worry with contempo.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album is the first album with Brian Johnson from AC/DC. It's a first class album as well. They're a lot of songs which are fun to listen to. I have to admit though that Bon Scott was a better singer and he was on most of AC/DC's better albums. But this album was the best on the charts and sales. Highway To Hell was AC/DC's first 1,000,000 sold album but Brian Johnson's first CD with AC/DC sold 1,000,000 and topped the charts extremely quickly. This album is very well composed and I would recommend getting it. This album is perfect. <br /> <br />1. Hells Bells - 9/10 <br />2. Shoot To Thrill - 10/10 <br />3. What Do You Do For Money Honey - 8/10 <br />4. Givin The Dog A Bone - 9/10 <br />5. Let Me Put My Love Into You - 8/10 <br />6. Back In Black - 10/10 <br />7. You Shook Me All Night Long - 10/10 <br />8. Have A Drink On Me - 8/10 <br />9. Shake A Leg - 7/10 <br />10. Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution - 10/10 <br /> <br />This album is just pure perfection from AC/DC but I will never forget Bon Scott.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO MOVED BY A MOVIE BEFORE, NOR WRITTEN A REVIEW OF ONE.  I WATCHED THIS TWICE THIS WEEKEND AND COULD WATCH IT AGAIN TONIGHT.  IT MUST BE THE COMBINATION OF THE ORCHESTRAL SOUND TRACK AND THE STORY TOGETHER MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THERE.  I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PHANTOM (GERRY BUTLER)FROM THE FIRST.  I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT MORE OR I'LL GO ON FOREVER.  I DON'T EVER!! FEEL THE URGE TO WATCH A MOVIE MORE THAN ONCE BUT THIS ONE I CAN WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN.  DAP
B000002JS8|5.0|This is the fifth album made by AC/DC from the late singer, Bon Scott. This is his last album but it was his best album as well. This CD was the first AC/DC to sell 1,000,000 and top the charts. The songs on this album are awesome and AC/DC have such good writing abilities. When Back In Black comes out with the new singer, Brian Johnson, it's really good as well but from all the AC/DC album this is probably my second favorite. <br /> <br />1. Highway To Hell - 10/10 <br />2. Girl's Got Rhythm - 8/10 <br />3. Walk All Over You - 9/10 <br />4. Touch Too Many - 8/10 <br />5. Beating Around The Bush - 9/10 <br />6. Shot Down In Flames - 7/10 <br />7. Get It Hot - 9/10 <br />8. If You Want (You've Got It) - 10/10 <br />9. Love Hungry Man - 9/10 <br />10. Night Prowler - 7/10 <br /> <br />A top-notch album from a top-notch band. AC/DC's \\"Highway To Hell\\" is a definite recommendation!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I love all genres of music but hold a special place for jazz in my heart. I bought Michael's album \\"Its Time\\" because I love jazz and those whose musical opinion I value gave it the thumbs up. I popped it in and listened to the first track, \\"Feeling Good\\". Starts slowly, unassumingly... then WOW, it starts swinging, he starts showing off his vocal prowess, and I sat there with my jaw dropped and knew INSTANTLY this guy was something special! Its rare that I like a song the very first time I hear it, I've never loved one the first time I heard it. I LOVED \\"Feelin' Good\\" the first time I heard it, and had the same reaction to track 4, \\"Quando Quando Quando.\\" Most of these songs are covers you will recognize, but the really amazing thing is that Michael makes them sound different... you feel like you're hearing them for the first time. Michael's voice is like a hybrid between a young Frank Sinatra and Harry Connick Jr., but his style is 100% his own. I literally have not stopped listening to this album (all tracks are great) since I bought it. I am going to see Michael perform in Memphis this August (2005), and I couldn't be more excited! I am very thankful for such a wonderful young artist who is bringing this fabulous music to the masses (and to many young fans previously unexposed to jazz). This music- and Michael Buble'- should be celebrated! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006879E|5.0|THIS IS THE ONLY C.D. I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO NON STOP FROM THE FIRST TIME I PURCHASED  IT OVER TWO YEARS AGO.  ALSO, SAW THIS BAND LIVE IN CLEVELAND FROM THE FOURTH ROW IN APRIL. BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND TALENT.  BEST CONCERT I HAVE EVER ATTENDED.  HAVE READ THE HISTORY ON THEIR TEN YEARS TOGETHER.  A CLASS ACT WITH A LONG ROAD TOGETHER THAT FINALLY MADE IT. CAN'T WAIT FOR ALBUM NUMBER TWO.
0553565915|5.0|This book was very inspirational. I enjoyed this book because the truth about near death experiences grab my attention. Thumbs up.
B00005JMJG|3.0|This movie had great acting, great writing, and great surreal effects depicting memories disappearing.  The film is a fantasy which asks one interesting but perhaps irrelevant question: If you'd failed in a relationship, would you try it again with the same person (after a great \\"first\\" date) if you new nothing about the past relationship except how it had ended bitterly? <br /> <br />Fantasies such as this are quite entertaining, but, like \\"Being John Malcovich\\", ultimately aren't really relevant.  Still, the film is very well executed on all levels.  A poignant comedy/fantasy, even if some plot elements are on the contrived side. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Are they kidding? Why on earth would they allow this guy to sing. It's terrible. I'm not the biggest SOAD fan, but I certainly enjoyed Toxicity. Why? Why? Why? How can you follow up that album with this crap. This band has no lasting power, just like 99 percent of the other \\"music\\" out there.  It sure sounds like someone is on a powertrip in this band. Ehhh, why do I even care. Completely embarassing.
B00000IPAX|5.0|okay. this is my opinion. i know blink, GC, SP, etc. aren't really \\"REAL punk\\". but i love them anyway. i don't care if they're classified as \\"REAL punk\\" or not. and you shouldn't judge people by what kind of music they listen to like the retard who said they secretly cringed when they saw people wearing blink GC and SP hoodies or whatever the hell they said. i mean, who are you to tell people what they should or shouldn't listen to? anyway, this album may not me \\"REAL punk\\" but whether people like it or not, pop punk is a subgenre to punk, and that's what this album is. i love the cd my favorite song is Adam's Song. blink 182 is definitely one of my favorite bands... they rock! peace.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  This review is for those thinking of buying the first release DVD.  I just read in an interview where Robert Rodriguez (the director) said that there will be an extended DVD release of this movie a few months after the initial release.  The extended release will have a few missing scenes put back in the movie.  I just thought fans of this film would like to know that information so they would not end up spending their money twice, or end up buying a version of the film that they didn't want.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Britney is indeed still one of musics major stars and she show sno signs of slowing down. This album collects a lot of her major successes to date. \\"Baby one more time\\", \\"toxic\\", \\"everytime\\", etc, etc are all classics of the day. If you like good music, you'll like this.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This review is based on the theatrical release.  I have heard that the uncut version basically includes the material that was ommitted to avoid an NC-17 Rating in Theatres. <br /> <br />The irony of this movie is that it uses the absolute most crude and lude humor to illustrate just how \\"out of touch\\" hollywood <br />is with socioty as a whole.  Underneath the most toilet brained, guttermouth, sick and twisted comedy, the story actually has moral values at it's core and celebrates the true freedoms we have in this country. (Can that actually be said?) <br /> <br />If you are a hollywood insider, pay attention.  There is no greater satisfaction than to see liberal idiots with no concept of the real world, blown up, shot, heads cut off...etc. <br /> <br />Trey and Matt...Thanks for a gut busting time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002GVO|1.0|This is junk. Simply put this is one of the worst albums ever put out. Mind you, so is everything the eagles put out. Forget this awful excuse of an album. It's nothing but club lounge pap/elevator music for the has been's of the pop world.
0345350499|5.0|For the longest time I heard people tell me that I should read Mists of Avalon.  It sounded stupid, the tale of Arthur from a woman's perspective? I mean come on.  So I finally gave in and bought the book and I have to say I was totally wrong.  This is the most amazing and powerful novel I have ever read.  It immediately moved to number 1 on my book list and will remain there.  The character development and attachment you as a reader get with Bradley's characters is superb.  She draws you into the story and at times it doesn't feel like you are reading.  The world of Aurthur and Morgaine completely envelop you and take you on a journey of unimaginable tales.   <br />The writing is magical.  Even if you didn't like the story of Arthur I have a feeling that you would enjoy this one.  Each character has a significance and you will love them one moment, hate them the next, and then cry for their pain.  You feel for every character in the book and become truly moved as an individual while reading this book.   <br />The book brings up the controversial topic of religion showing a battle between the pagan beliefs of the Druids and Preistesses of Avalon and the newly formed Christians.  Bradley does a good job at showing the weakness and strengths of both religions and gets her point across that it doesn't really matter what you call it because it is all one belief and one God.  The book is truly moving and she is fantastic at handling the topic and respecting both sets of beliefs.  <br />Hands down the best book I've ever read, so you should read it!!!
B00079018K|5.0|It's funny how the amazon review states that \\"There's nothing original about Kasabian,\\" and then finishes the review to say that the band finds \\"just the right balance between primitive riffs and space-age grooves.\\" <br /> <br />Has any other band really done that? If so, please let me know! <br /> <br />The album is great... it reminds me of the Verve, but with more of an edge, and some DRIVING bass lines that really make you want to move. <br /> <br />A great combination of some cool electronic effects, some solid musicianship, some bangin rock out grooves, and easy to listen to yet powerful vocals. <br /> <br />Check it out!
B0000AZAUQ|5.0|From the opening verses sung in Japanese, there's a distinct sense that something dark and sinister is going on just beneath the surface of this record.  It's a very visual album, and as Bowie takes the listener through this journey, he confronts his psychological shadow head on over and over again, ultimately gaining control over it. This is apparent in the arrangement of the songs, especially with Robert Fripp's barely controlled guitar work. Between Fripp and Carlos Alomar, it's as if Bowie had unleashed two deadly snakes from a wicker basket, only to coax them back at the very last second before allowing them to do any harm.  Chronologically, Scary Monsters came after the Berlin trilogy albums of the mid to late '70s, which marked the peak of Bowie's experimental period.  As he confesses in 'Ashes to ashes', he apparently wasn't just experimenting musically on those previous albums, but also with heroin (and God only knows what other strange drugs).  This may very well be the last of Bowie's truly classic and timeless albums from beginning to end.  The SACD version is well worth getting, as it adds another dimension to a spectacular recording.  <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|first off, maybe I'm the only one who shares this viewpoint, but oh well, it's my opinion and I'll let it fly.  Daron does a LOT to make this band as diverse as it is.  I personally think he is awesome on the mic on this CD, especially in such tracks as Lost in Hollywood.  He's quite unique and so freaking energetic.  Seeing him live April 30 in Austin sealed it up for me.  He's awesome.  Yes, Serj is the man on vocals, but what's wrong with the two sharing the 'spotlight'.  In my humble opinion, nothing, nothing at all is wrong with it.   <br /> <br />Thanks to SOAD for another kicking, diverse, and fun album, and I look forward to Hypnotize in the fall.
B00003CXGG|5.0|If this doesn't help Jet worm his way into American women's hearts, i don't know what would. In this film he is incredibly sexy and has fantastic chemistry with the beautiful and talented Aaliyah. The story is in line with the worst martial arts stories of all time, and the fighting is incredibly hokey, yet i dare any hot-blooded female to take her eyes off of him for one second! Jackie Chan - i love you too, but Jet Li has won my heart forever -- sorry dude.
B000002G8J|4.0|The cover photo of this album captures the mood of this album to the proverbial 'T'...It is generally living-room relaxed and laid-back, and though cut in the general mold of the preceding year's release \\"Slowhand,\\" this effort has a bit more grit to it, as evidenced in the eight-minute treatment given the traditional blues standard \\"Early in the Morning\\" and the honky-tonkish \\"Tulsa Time,\\" both delivered with a winning \\"edge.\\"    However, tuneful and rhythmically-measured songs are the order of the day here.  Clapton pens four tunes himself, easily the best of which is the catchy pop-shuffle \\"Watch Out for Lucy.\\" The commercial hit of this album is the understated \\"Promises,\\" which displays Clapton's increasingly relaxed vocal tone offset against an equally congenial backdrop of steady-rolling instrumental and rhythm arrangements.  There is not a single standout cut amongst this collection, but the quality is uniformly good, the musicianship of the high standard one expects of Clapton and his cohorts, the overall end-effect being one of over-arching pleasantness.  This is not a \\"great\\" album, but is one that wears well; it is, indeed, very easy on the ears...
B00030590I|5.0|Okay, Zhang Yimou is one of the all-time great film directors and i love his movies, though this one came across as a Disney cartoon done in real-life. My main complaint is that he didn't give Jet much to do. The part of the so-called Hero was a wooden, 2-dimensional character who wasn't on screen much. Instead, the story is really a visual tapestry of how China became united, without much dialog. Whatever. Great for kids, I guess.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has been singing and playing professionally for nearly 8 years - appearing on many accomplished singers albums. I've known about him since summer of '04. He was playing piano and singing Jesus Walks on the MuchMusic awards. What a talented musician he is. His voice isn't spectacular, but it's minimalist and has a ton of emotion. He's quite a fine pianist as well. He's frequently called the male Alicia Keys, which I can understand, as they do have similarities. <br /> <br />Here's a track-by-track review of his masterpiece. <br />1. Prelude: A great introduction to the album. Draws the listener in with a simple piano part, and soulful, soft vocals. 5/5 <br />2. Let's Get Lifted: The Prelude blends right into this. This has a slightly dark feel to it. It's about, well, getting lifted. Absoloutely gorgeous vocals. 5/5 <br />3. Used to Love U: Upbeat, fun song to a girl who is materialistic. Slightly overrated, there are much better songs on this album. But it's a good welcome song to get new fans. 4.5/5 <br />4. Alright: Lyrically weak. He's singing about being drunk, and how good a girl looks and how even though she has a boyfriend, he wants her. Bad concept. Vocally weak, he stays on the same few notes. 2.5/5 <br />5. She Don't Have To Know: Opens with beautiful soaring vocals. Another concept somewhat like #4, but much stronger. 5/5 <br />6. Number One: Good opening once again. John works better with R&B songs, not hip hop and rap. Kanye understands this, and it's a sweet sounding R&B song despite Kanye appearing on it. 5/5 <br />7. I Can Change: Good beats, and good vocals and lyrics from John. Maybe it's just me, but Snoop's voice bugs the crap out of me. His lyrics sound so fake and his voice is annoying. 3.5/5 (Snoop only gets extra points for his Sam Cooke shoutout) <br />8. Ordinary People: What's not to say about this song? A gorgeous, honest song with John just singing and playing the piano. 5/5 <br />9. Stay With You: Possibly my favourite songon this album. It's total R&B, no big beat in the background. John's voice is so beautiful and soft. Album highlight. 5/5 <br />10. Let's Get Lifted Again: I LOVE the background music in this one. It could just be instrumental, and I'd love it the same. His voice is falsetto in it, and soars so high that the beauty can bring someone to tears. It's not a real song on the album, sort of an intro-type thing. 5/5 <br />11. So High: The album gets so good around the last half of the CD, it blows me away. 'Ohh this feels so crazy/Ohh this love is blazing/Baby we're so high/Walking on clouds now/So high'. This song just soars. Another standout track. 5/5 <br />12. Refuge (When It's Cold Outside): Another gorgeous melody. John sounds so sweet and romantic. ANOTHER standout. 5/5 <br />13. It Don't Have To Change: SO old school. Frigging amazing song. \\"All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change/No it don't, have to change\\". Beautiful vocals from each other singer on the song. 5/5 <br />14. Live It Up: Very romantic song. Great closer. 5/5 <br /> <br />The whole idea of this album is love, but it's not cheesy. Each song is so beautifully crafted, and John Legend just shines. His voice is nothing extremely special. But he knows his limits and makes the most of it. I cannot wait to hear more from this genius.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|1980 saw the release of Van Halen's \\"Women and Children First,\\" their third album in a chain of classic releases spanning the late 70s into the early 80s. \\"Women and Children First\\" is probably the bands' most under-appreciated album. This is due to the fact that it's in the middle of a chain of classic releases like \\"Van Halen,\\" \\"Van Halen II\\" and \\"1984.\\" Yet it hasn't quite received the cult status of \\"Fair Warning\\" or the sales of \\"Diver Down.\\"<br /><br />Although \\"Van Halen II\\" (1979) is a classic album, it's slightly underwhelming when compared to the magnificent self-titled debut (1978). It's the classic case of the \\"sophomore slump,\\" when a band that has been playing clubs for years uses up all its best material on the debut, and then has to use what's left over for the follow-up (although what was \\"left over\\" was still pretty good!). For \\"Woman and Children First,\\" the band recorded a whole new batch of songs that sounded fresh, and less like leftovers.<br /><br />It goes without saying that Van Halen was at their prime during the Roth years (1978-1985). The debut album and the follow-up see Van Halen young, fast and furious. This was also the case by the time Van Halen released \\"Women and Children First,\\" but the band also sounds a little more loose, more relaxed, but without losing any of the fire or passion that made them so great. Eddie's playing, which goes without saying, sounds terrific. Every song on \\"Women and Children First\\" has one, or two killer, killer solos. Bassist Michael Anthony and drummer Alex Van Halen provide a stellar rhythm section and David Lee Roth shines as only he can. There has never been, nor will there ever be, in the history of rock n' roll, a singer that has the charisma, charm, showmanship and ironic wit of David Lee Roth.<br /><br />\\"Women and Children First,\\" starts out surprisingly mid-paced (although never tepid) with its first couple of songs. The classic rock staples \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...\\" and \\"Everybody Want's Some!\\" get the album off to a great start. The former a dedication to the endurance of the rock n' roll sprit and the latter a tribute to, well, what everybody wants. Both songs feature Eddie Van Halen at his best. His solos never sounded more soulful or melodic. And Dave just shines. \\"Everybody Wants Some\\" really shows classic David Lee Roth at his best, especially with his \\"I like way the line runs up the back of the stocking,\\" and \\"no no no no no, don't take `em off\\", and \\"yeah, that's it, a little more to the right\\" lines. These two tracks really show classic Van Halen at there finest. The pace slows down even more for the bluesy \\"Fools\\" an ode to the powers that be that would obstruct the prowling of the Diamond one.<br /><br />The pace goes into hyperdrive with the classic \\"Romeo Delight\\" which is probably one of Van Halen's most underrated songs. The main riff is absolutely killer and Eddie's playing is fast and furious. One of the best moments of this song comes towards the end, when the rush of the song comes to a sudden halt, and then you hear the sound of a tapping, softly at first, and then getting louder and louder. Dave's quite melodic \\"oh baby, feel my heartbeat, feel my heartbeat, feel my heartbeat\\" over the tapping which gets increasingly louder adds the perfect effect as only Diamond Dave could. The Sabbath-like \\"Tora! Tora!\\" which leads into the anarchic \\"Loss of Control\\" are two non-song tracks that add a bit of spice to the album and are essential to its overall flow.<br /><br /> The band goes semi-acoustic towards the end of \\"Women and Children First.\\" \\"Take Your Whisky Home\\" sounds like an old blues song from the South. The lines \\"Well my baby, she don't want me around, she says she's tired of watching me fall down, she wants the good life, whhah, and all the rest, but I like that bottle better than the rest\\" show the true spirit of classic Van Halen. The acoustic \\"Could this be Magic\\" is pure magic. In it, Dave sings of the inevitable doom ofwhat will become in his current romance, but in pure Dave kitsch. The background vocals and harmonies from Eddie, Michael and Nicolette Larson add the perfect touch. The album closes with the beautifully written ballad \\"In a Simple Rhyme.\\" This is simply one of rock's greatest, most highly underrated love songs. It actually rocks pretty hard, but is elegant and soulful. I would go as far as to say that it's like a \\"Sweet Child `O Mine\\" of the early 80s. Eddie and Michael's background vocals over Dave's soulful blues delivery is pure magic. Eddie's thunderous solo over Michael Anthony's melodic bass line sounds terrific. And Diamond Dave never shined so bright. Some of his best lyrics are right here:<br /><br />Then she made the mountains sing<br /><br />Birds against an icy sky<br /><br />And I heard bells ringin'<br /><br />I think I heard an angel sigh<br /><br />\\"Woman and Children First\\" closes with an untitled 15 second Sabbath-like instrumental titled \\"Growth.\\" Supposedly, the follow-up album, (which turned out to be \\"Fair Warning\\" 1981) would begin with the same riff, although this turned out not to be the case. \\"Growth\\" sort of comes out of left field, but is none-the-less an interesting piece of music and a cool way to end the album.<br /><br />The first six Van Halen albums are absolutely essential cornerstones to any great rock collection. Although \\"Women and Children First\\" is not the band's most well known album, it is still a classic and a must have for any Van Halen fan, or fan of hard rock or classic rock in general.able doom of what will become in his current romance, but in pure Dave kitsch.

B000683VI4|5.0|This is updated version of that ole love story most all of us love and endures.  Here, though is added the modern dilemma of Alzheimers, and its pain, but its defeatedness by a vibrant, mature love.<br /><br />The acting here is superb from the young Noah and Allie to in my mind the excellent performance by Garner and Rowlands.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, around vintage low-country mansions and towns of Charleston coastline.  The opening scenes are superb work and the soundtrack is adequate.<br /><br />This is lighthearted movement of the developing story between two young lovers from across opposing sides of the tracks and their struggle through parents, war and new found loves.<br /><br />Won't divulge any of this excellent Sparks written work.  Will definitely now take this volume off the wife's shelves to read and compare with the movie version.
B000065VB0|4.0|After releasing two lukewarm solo albums, Peter got his mojo back in a big way and went and released one of the best albums ever with his third untitled album, but we all know it's called MELT ;-)<br /><br />It's not really 'prog rock' as you would know it from the early-mid seventies; this is much more avant-pop with new wave - there are very few extended instrumental passages and the songs mostly follow simple structures.<br /><br />Instead, Peter Dazzles with his choice of quirky synth and guitar textures and intriguing melodies. The production is muscular and packs punch, and the material is very uptempo.<br /><br />The songs ignore the whole concept of 'genre' and other such pigeon-holing, and mix many various styles together and make an original sound. Gabriel also made the wise choice of collaborating with various established musicians, including Phil Collins on some of the tracks.<br /><br />The best songs are the insistent &#34;Intruder&#34;, funky bass of &#34;I don't remember&#34; epic tale &#34;Family Snapshots&#34;, rocking &#34;through the wire&#34;, the oddball fun of &#34;Games without frontiers&#34; and racism-mocking punk-rock &#34;not one of us&#34;.<br /><br />Despite the unlimited internet space devoted to praising it, I've never cared for &#34;Biko&#34;, but the other ethnic song &#34;Lead a normal life&#34; is very unsettling in a subtle way and might be the best song on the album.<br /><br />However, I am not glad that Gabriel left the band... just imagine you have most of this album, Behind the lines / Dukes travels / end as one epic, Collins' &#34;Misunderstanding&#34; and &#34;Please don't ask&#34;, those kick=a instrumentals from Defector, &#34;Slogans&#34; &#34;Steppes&#34; and &#34;Jacuzzi&#34; and even the best songs from Smallcreeps day, like &#34;Moonshine&#34;, &#34;Working in line&#34; and &#34;Overnight Job&#34; all together on one monster double album, that would have been such a wonderful album. Maybe not entirely possible withregards to various people's fighting getting in the way and stuff, with Banks and Rutherford probably shaking their heads going &#34;No no, we CAN'T have ANOTHER DOUBLE album, we WONT ALLOW it&#34; but it would have been one amazing piece of music. And the band was still missing the the pastoral beauty of Anthony Phillips...<br /><br />But that said, Peter Gabriel more than holds his own as a solo artist here. Terrific Album.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time this weekend, and I was blown  away. This is a wonderful story - it has everything I love about Wizard of Oz and Labyrinth, the crazy creatures in the alternate magical world, the coming-of-age of the protagonist, a great emotional punch - with superb animation and direction. I highly recommend this movie. It's beautiful.
0743454537|5.0|I haven't cried this hard since I got my leg amputated. A delightful blend of witty humor and unusual controversy, My Sister's Keeper will remain a well remembered coming-of-age novel for many years to come. A story of love, sacrifice, and hardship, it ranks as one of the best books I've ever read--and i simply could not put it down.
B000089J0R|4.0|These guys are fast as Hell!  Ya gotta love the speedy guitars and pounding drums!  Head banging and fist pumping metal if I ever heard it!  Probably my 2nd favorite band right now, just behind Sonata Arctica.... <br /> <br />Why not 5 stars then?....Well, the singer is very good, but not quite great - not enough variation....and every song is a bit similar, though all are very good....and the lyrics - all typical dungeons & dragons type lyrics.... <br /> <br />Hopefully these guys continue & grow like I think they can....Just add a little more variety in lyrics, vocals, and music and they have potential to be the best out there.... <br /> <br />I defintely suggest this one to any true metal head!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Although Star Wars has gotten a new look to it, its not a bad thing,longer scenes, and redigitilized so that even the Millenium Falcon doesn't have those fuzzy black lines that often occupied CGI graphics from that time. However, For Diehard Star Wars fan, this probally is like the Sith blowing up Aldeeran. Very, very bad.<br /><br />Yes this is remixed and remastered, but I rather liked it, except for all those purple effects that Lucas felt must be there to accompany explosions. They make the atmosphere rather...well...purply.<br /><br />However, I understand how others feel with this new edition, its a classic changed to suit changing times, but after all, it is Lucas' story and he tells it how he sees fit.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I love this soundtrack!!  <br /> <br />\\"Once more, with feeling\\" was one of the true highlights of the BtVS  saga. Magnificent! <br /> <br /> <br />These are my favourite tracks: <br /> <br />- Great and very funny start with track 1 \\"Going through the motions\\", Sarah Michelle Gellar can sing! <br /> <br />- I absolutely adore Amber Benson in no. 5, \\"Under your spell\\". Absolute Bliss! Brings tears to my eyes every time... Amber's quite simply the greatest multi-talent I know of. She can do pretty much whatever she wants, and does it; acting, singing, directing, writing, anything really. Look up her site: [...] <br /> <br />- James Marsters did a darn great job in no. 7 \\"Rest in Peace\\".  <br />He rocks! <br /> <br />- No. 11 \\"Standing\\" with Tony Head is another excellent part of this soundtrack. I also recommend Tony's own record \\"Music for Elevators\\". This man is brilliant! Check him out in one of the many British tv series he's participating in these days. <br /> <br />- Amber Benson and Tony Head comes together in the heart-wrenching duet \\"Under your spell/Standing Reprise.  <br />No. 12 is very sad and wonderful. <br /> <br />- No. 14 \\"Walk through the fire\\" is a real power song. Grand job, Sarah! <br /> <br />Those are my personal favourites, but the whole thing is down right smashing, so if you're a hardcore BtVS fan too, buy it. A must-have. <br /> <br /> <br />Forever tarafied...
B00005JMX6|5.0|There is only one justifiable reason why anybody would consider purchasing this movie.  Some reviewers may claim that the storyline is interesting, that it is a heartwarming love story about a pornstar being saved from that filthy world of debauchery, that it reminds them of all the cliches from high school, etc. <br /> <br />But at the end of the day the only people who will find this movie worthwhile are those who watch it in the company of a large tub of Vaseline.  And worthwhile it is, indeed! <br /> <br />Now for the vitals. <br /> <br />Nudity:  Yes, some brief chest shots and one unfortunate scene in which the Emile Hirsch runs down a street naked. <br /> <br />Does Elisha Cuthbert get nude:  No, but she gets very close and acts very sexy. <br /> <br />Best scene:  Elisha Cuthbert in limo having intercourse.  While you don't get to see her breasts or other naughty bits, this is a very arousing scene. <br /> <br />There is a general level of eroticism exuded by Elisha Cuthbert throughout this film.  She is one of the most spectacular actresses with regard to her ability to act sexy and sensual without demeaning and trivializing herself as a mere sex object. <br /> <br />This is not a pornograhic film, but it is highly erotic.  Highly recommended!
B00005JMX6|4.0|I think this movie is bound to be a classic.  Just like FAST TIMES, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, PRETTY IN PINK, etc...  It is a bit more insightful and realistic than your typical teenager movie.  In fact, it is miles better than most teen movies I've subjected myself to lately.  Very enjoyable!  I recommend this one if you need a laugh.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|This movie utterly fails to capture the message of the H.G. Wells classic novel.  Herein lies the irony:  The eloi are not depicted as the subservient race that Wells meant them to be.  That part is instead played by the audience. It's the audience whom the film has been marketed to who truly end up representing Wells' eloi, and the morlocks are embodied by the film executives responsible for letting this movie see the light of day.  It's my hope that Simon Wells isn't a total idiot, and that this movie is just his way of proving his great-grandfather's anxities over the future to be completely justified.  Man will eventually devolve into little more than beasts and cattle, and this film is evidence of our race trudging one step closer and being happy as hell about it.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|A depressed photographer who doesn't want to negotiate with reality and tells lies with works, and a girl who speaks truth to whom she doesn't love and ceases to love when truth is demanded. What exactly is reality is not very easy to determine. It's hard to tell what \\"closer\\" really means: too close and all would become the very reality which one seeks to avoid, or fantasy or a kind of vagueness, a fiction, makes a sort real intimacy actually possible. Maybe both, I suppose. Reality and fiction are somewhat interwoven and hard to separate. Of course, the movie touches more than the issue above. <br />I enjoy the movie but the way the scenes are connected make it somewhat like an underlined parts of a story instead of a story that has a continuating process, which is considered to be a weakness from my perspective. However, I also think that the movie would be too long and lose its intensity. <br /> <br />Anyway, worth watching. Owen A, Portman A-, Law B+, Roberts B. Still, my perspectives.
0688152023|5.0|I have had this book for at least 3 years and I got it because like lots of other girls, I liked ballet and it has always been a dream for me, another dream for me is mac'n cheese so, girls if you know nothing about ballet and can't even do a split dont worry, this book is perfect. You can go at your own pace and pick out the excercises that target your undesireable areas but dont pass up the ones that dont look hard, you dont work up a sweat but every one of the stretches does something good, pretty soon people will start to notice you because, you will start walking different, I sometimes do one or two of the balancing excercises before I go out and I have to say that this book will have you striking a pose without even knowing it. There is one thing that I think can be done to make this book perfect. I have literally worn out my book and I would purchase it again if it were smaller and wire bound and use it for travel.  The pictures are lovely and even if you are a \\"couch potato\\" this book will do wonders for your posture and personally, the Complete Spinal Stretch has worked out crooks in my back like magic. This is the kind of book that becomes like a big secret because it does not take much for you to feel a difference, the change will be gradual but lasting.
B00008ADPF|4.0|this is an excellent album from nickelback. in reply to some stupid lil kid who thinks they know everythin bowt rock music, this is nickelback's fourth album (five if you include their EP Hesher) and is probably their heaviest yet still the most mainstream. confusing huh? this is the album that has the most rock ballads on it. i think nickelback are tryin to create how you remind me too many times (do this anymore, someday, feelin way too damn good) yet we have many good solid rock tracks and flat on the floor has got to be the best opener to any rock album ive ever heard. its seriously ace! the limited edition has an excellent cover of elton john's saturday night's alright for fighting and a couple of extra tracks that were on the two versions of how you remind me's single. again we keep on coming back to how you remind me which is why this cd gets 4 stars. yes, how you remind me is a good song, but listen here nickelback, YOU DONT HAVE TO KEEP ON RECREATING IT IN HOPE OF ANOTHER RADIO HIT!!!! this is the reason this album only gets 4 stars because all the other songs are classic original songs that everyone should hear. once you get past teh how you remind me remakes you have a brillinat solid rock album!  <br />Best Songs: <br />Saturday Night's Alright (limited edition only) 10/10 <br />Flat On The Floor 10/10 <br />Should've Listened 9/10 <br />Figured You Out 8/10
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Funny, touching, sweet, profound in a perfect way.  Great soundtrack (I bought that, too), there isn't much of a plot, doesn't need one.  Very simple story, very lovely.  The scene at the hospital when Bill Murray is talking to an elderly Japanese man seems completely unrehearsed, natural and it worth watching the movie only for that.  The two Japanese ladies sitting behind them keep laughing, it is just great.  Bill Murray in the role of a slightly tired and jaded actor is beautiful.  Just beautiful.  By the way, I've never seen Bill Murray in anything that wasn't great.  I've heard he's \\"difficult\\" to work with, but is that a bad thing?  He does great work.  This movie is a delight.  Scarlett Johannsen is superb, the actor who plays her husband is a perfect young husband and the girl who plays the dumb action movie actress is a hoot.  Beautifully shot, beautifully paced.  Made me want to visit Tokyo.  Each scene is fun to watch in itself, little vignettes (did I spell that right?).
B0007GAERG|5.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" exceeded ALL of my expectations. I never would have figured that she could have come back so strong. Her voice is just as magical as it was before. It's comforting to know that Mariah still has what it takes to be the vocal diva that she was in the 90's. When I first heard \\"It's Like That\\" I knew Mariah was back in true form. Then she has blown me away even more with the stunning and dynamic \\"We Belong Together.\\" But this isn't where it ends. It's just the beginning. She goes on to close the album with the breathtaking Gospel \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" Mariah has reinvented herself for the better and it sounds like she had a great time doing it.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This was the first Unearth cd I got, and not the last. I also have Stings of Conscience, but this is better in my opinion. This is a 40 min onslaught of the best metalcore around. After I heard \\"The Great Dividers\\" and saw the video, I had to get this. Every song is worth listening to and shows that Unearth has matured since their last release. Here's my song by song breakdown and rating:<br /><br />1. The Great Dividers - The first single and still one of my favorites. Solid start to finish 5/5<br /><br />2. Failure - Catchy main riff and a solo for the intro. 4.5/5<br /><br />3. This Lying World - The intro riff gets annoying at times, but the song really picks up after it. 4.5/5<br /><br />4. Black Hearts Now Reign - My current favorite and good enough for a single. The whole song is amazing and the solo is awesome. 5/5<br /><br />5. Zombie Autopilot - Another favorite of mine. The solo/riff is catchy and fun to play. 5/5<br /><br />6. Bloodlust of the Human Condition - Great, heavy song with awesome solos. 4.5/5<br /><br />7. Lie to Purify - Catchy riff in the beginning, then gets heavier. 4.5/5<br /><br />8. Endless - I first heard this on Headbanger's Ball Vol 1, and had to hear more of this band. Now it's on this cd for your pleasure. Pretty much a typical Unearth song with the heavy riffing, but one of their best. 5/5<br /><br />9. Aries - A slow song with pianos and some singing in the background. I always skip this. 3/5<br /><br />10. Predetermined Sky - Heavy song that will make you bang your head. Nice lead line for the chorus. The end is the heaviest the song (possibly album) gets. 4.5/5<br /><br />11. False Idols - Probably the worst song on the album, BUT that doesn't mean it sucks. It's by Unearth, meaning the worst is the best most bands put out. 4/5<br /><br />So there's my song reviews of this amazing album. Go buy/download/borrow/burn this. I don't care, just check out Unearth if you haven't yet. Like me, you won't be disappointed. If you liked this album, check out As I Lay Dying (Frail Worlds Collapse), All that Remains (This Darkened Heart), Dillinger Escape Plan (Miss Machine), and The Haunted (rEVOLVEr). Have a nice day.rt), Dillinger Escape Plan (Miss Machine), and The Haunted (rEVOLVEr). Have a nice day.
B000002L99|5.0|Van Halen lost a lot of personality when it lost David Lee Roth, but Sammy Hagar stepped in and hit the ball out of the ballpark on this album.  Quite simply, this is the best Van Halen album put out, and may be one of the best hard rock albums ever made.  Even to this day, every song on this one sounds technically remarkable.  Forget the fact that Alex Van Halen uses Simmons Drums.  The drumming is hardcore, and it ranks up there with the best.  And Eddie, well, what can you say.  Take my word for it; this is a top notch album by a top notch band in their prime.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I really wanted to hate this band when i first heard \\"I'm Not Ok (I promise)\\". it just seemed like the music that i hated so badly (emo). just for some background, my favorite bands are Tom Waits, Dead Kennedys, Aphex Twin, Rammstein, and recently, Franz Ferdinand. I normally don't like anything i see on MTV, for the simple fact that much of what they show all sounds the same to me. I suppose Franz Ferdinand changed that for me... The definative moment when i realized that i may like this band was when i saw the video for Helena. The raw emotion portrayed there just hit a note in me, now, i have to visit their site every day and watch the video at least 3 times a day. This music doesn't sound whiny like a lot of emo does, and i really like the way the singer looks... something about that sickly and frail look, i guess. if i ever make a movie, Gerrard is going to be the hero, or the villain, i can't decide. overall, a very good listen for anyone who likes this kind of stuff. these guys are different from most of what you see on MTV..they're talented!!!!
B0001HAISG|5.0|If you ever, even for a moment, wished you could visit Neverland, this is the movie for you.  It's pure magic--perfectly cast, perfectly filmed, and perfectly wonderful.  The special effects are just that, special...so special, if fact, that they don't intrude at all, but make the whole adventure infinitely deep and ultimately believable.   <br /> <br />Casting couldn't have been better, from Tinkerbell to Hook.  But, I think Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan steals the show.  His charismatic smile, in particular, drew me in, and I didn't doubt for a moment that Wendy and her brothers would throw away everything they knew and loved to fly away with him.   <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|2.0|I bought this album with high hopes.  I always loved Mariah Carey's older music.  I loved \\"We Belong Together\\" from the moment I heard it on the radio.  But then I purchased the album and realized that most of the songs sound the same- making the album slow and boring.  I wasn't WOW'd.  For some strange reason I can't help but picture a young Michael Jackson singing these songs instead of it being Mariah.  Her pitch and tone just sounds completely different in this album.  Mariah, what happened?  I'm just not that impressed.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|i didn't laugh out loud with this one, as i have with trey and matts other movies. I did however find this very entertaining from the in your face humor of puppet sex to the subtle humor of good will hunting(matt damon) being the new \\"TIMMY\\". <br />I sat ammused and entertained throughout,and thats what a movie is meant to do. <br />   psuedo-intellectuals should stay away or make sure none of your friends catch you watching this, because it is good semi-clean sophmoric humor through and through and you wouldn't want to be labled a  myopic philistine. <br /> <br />   so take it from a misanthropic troglodyte \\"dis here b good\\"
006054094X|5.0|I certainly do not claim to be a scholar on world exploration but Menzies does seem to put forth unwavering evidence that the Chinese explored the world before Europeans.  Supposing that even a modest percentage of his assertions could be expelled, the overbearing amount of documentation seems to be supportive of his theory, that is, with tens of thousands of men and hundreds of ships in their treasure fleets, the Chinese discovered all the continents from 1421-1423.<br /><br />Menzies' evidence is supported in maps; trade winds and currents; early European explorers' accounts; shipwrecks found and dated; DNA similarities to indigenous people throughout the world; animals and plants displaced from their natural areas; petroglyphs; Chinese artifacts found in many areas of the world dating to early 1400's; linguistic similarities all over the world; etc.  Coupled with the Chinese's high level of intellect in establishing latitudes and longitudes, ability to survive long distances at sea by having entire ships devoted to carrying food, the genius to desalinate sea water, etc. there is every reason to believe the Chinese discovered the world before Europeans.<br />Many refute the evidence but it certainly makes for an imbibing read.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is what sheer entertainment is all about. Joel Schumacher is a genius when it comes to casting and production. Gerard Butler's performance was breathtaking and commanding. He brought the Phantom to life and gave him a soul.  The chemistry between The Phantom and Christine was electrifying especially during \\"Point of No Return\\"....the look on Raoul's face and the tears in his eyes couldn't have been staged. I found myself hoping Christine would choose the Phantom. No stage version could ever match the raw emotion of the last scene in the cave...the gesture of Christine putting the ring on her finger and kissing the Phantom was cathartic. The great movies like this allow me to feel the passion, pain, and love along with the actors. I'm so glad such a wonderful play was made into a powerful, beautiful movie, because now I can have the \\"Angel of Music\\" in my mind with the click of a button.
B0007TX894|3.0|About that title, this may be a little too strong. By the time of signify, what happened. Steven Wilson... I don't know no more about PT now. Anyway..  <br /> <br />This year, Blackfield totally got me ! hundred times better.
0679731725|3.0|\\"Remains of the Day\\" is an overwhelmingly simple novel of an English butler and memoirs of his service for Lord Darlington, his favorite employer.  Novel situates itself in a pre-WWII era and converses through the war.  I will divide this review into three parts so I can cover most of the novel in the most organized way. <br /> <br />Stevens - The Perfect Butler- <br />Somewhere in the novel, Stevens says that he believes only English butlers can come close to perfection as a manservant.  After reading this novel, I must agree that he does a fantastic job as a butler throughout the novel maintaining his professionalism towards his employer, employer's guests and towards the rest of the servant-staff.  Even for the pre-WWII era, Stevens was highly advanced as a butler which is reflected by his methods of having intense servant interviews, \\"pep-talk\\" before major events and his daily meetings with the housekeeper in maintaining order of the Darlington Hall. <br /> <br />Romantic Stevens- <br />It is very sad to think that Stevens was never married or had children.  His life started with his loyalty and services to Lord Darlington and drained towards  his duties for Mr. Faraday.  There are various implications in his affection towards Miss Kenton (housekeeper in Darlington Hall), but he never confesses his love and attraction to her face. Towards the end of the novel, when he comes close to confessing his emotions, he finds out that he stands no chance to meddle in Miss Kenton's relationship with her husband, and backs away. <br /> <br />Stevens - a friend- <br />Throughout the novel, there are various incidents where Stevens takes onto unusual requests of services from his employer and guests.  For example, where he does the relationship talk with Cardinal, Jr.  Stevens' awkward sense of personalizing and frankness towards his profession makes him a unique person and a very interesting butler overall. <br /> <br />I loved this book and recommend it for an easy weekendread. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|SOAD's latest release 'Mesmerize' is the first of a double part album and it shows the band have definately changed with more political style writing and modern songs.  But 'Mesmerize' is still your typical heavy, fast-paced, drug-fuelled System album.  But dont expect it to be like 'Toxicity' as it is a complete leap from anything they've done before but in my opinion its more catchier than their previous 'Steal This Album' however it takes awhile to get into the new rythm of the songs and Daron on vocals whereas Serj mostly does backing which is quite disappointing however an amazing album you should definately buy it if not just for collection purposes!
B0000CAXID|2.0|i am a big foo fighters fan and i really dont care for this album. the first 4 tracks are really good. I'll stick around is the best song on here it totally rocks. but after the first 4 tracks it rapidly declines. get The Colour and Shape or Theres nothing left to lose. definatly pass on this
B00005JKNC|5.0|I don't know why there are so many negative or mixed reviews about this movie. I can only assume that fans of Jim Carrey expected him to be over the top (like he was in the Mask and Ace Venture), and those that didn't like those movies (this is the category that I fall into), assumed that he would be over the top so they dismissed this movie sight unseen. Jim Carrey fans STAY AWAY as you will probubly be disappointed in this movie. Non-Jim Carrey fans \\"Please, Please, Please\\" go see this movie, you will not be disappointed. Forget Jim Carrey, think of a young Tom Hanks, or dare I suggest a young Jimmy Stewart. If you do not know anything about this movie think \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" or any other Frank Capra film. This is an excellent gem of a movie that was (and I fear will continue to be) missed by so many, simply because people hear the name \\"Jim Carrey\\" and make of their mind (good or bad) without even seeing the movie. This movie was great, by far the best picture I saw in 2001. Jim Carrey as a serious actor was excellent (who knew), Martin Landau..excellent...and the girl who played the love interest (sorry I forgot her name) was outstanding. This is a movie expierence that you can share with your wife, your girlfriend, your Mom and Dad, your favorite Aunt and Uncle, and never be embarrassed by anything of the screen (now how many Jim Carrey movies can you say that about). Go now, Buy, Rent, Borrow, set your DVR, but get a copy of this movie and set aside an evening for a movie pleasure that you have not had in an extremely long time. I cannot reccommend it enough (I would give it 10 stars if I could, and believe me I am very criticle of movies in general).
B000002AVF|5.0|We find Mariah Carey on this particular but beautiful album jumping into a bit of pop and RnB. From the club hit \\"FANTASY\\" to the slow sweeping ballads of \\"ONE SWEET DAY\\" & \\"ALWAYS BE MY BABY\\". Her voice is truly a gift here as well. It's hard to imagine that she once had such a great gift to be used to an extent it became normal for Mariah fans to her her going high. I still think this is Mariah's best album even though now counting it a decade older. I still bought it. It's still being played in my home and it will be played for years to come. So c'mon guys. Get this album and see for yourselves.
6305910340|5.0|I almost didn't write a review on this movie because their were so many positive reviews already, but then a good thing is worth repeating and a good move is worth seeing. As other reviewers have said this is really not a movie abouth chess, but a movie about fathers and sons. However, if you have ever played in, or even attended, an amature chess tournament, the \\"in jokes\\" will be that much funnier. But again even if you don't know anything about chess, you will really enjoy this movie. Joe Mantegna was excellent, Ben Kingsley was excellent, William H Macy was excellent, Max Pomeranc was really excellent. When people complain that there are no good movies anymore, maybe that are just watching the wrong movies. Get this movie, you will not be disappointed.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Chris is singing more like he did with Soundgarden and the rest of the band made changes to accommodate (chicken or the egg) but that doesen't mean they sound like Soundgarden. They sound like Audioslave. Very solid album. Pick up an electric guitar Chris!!!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|This season of the OC was amazing. This is the perfect gift for any teenager who loves to watch the troubled lives of rich kids living in Orange County. Beware, the OC can become addictive. <br /> <br />This DVD is worth the money. <br /> <br />~Don't forget to buy Season 1~
B0007O38F8|1.0|Now i bought Get Rich or Die Tryin I'll admit...Didn't really like that but liked a few songs...But This Cd was a total waste of my money..fa reals...Nothin but Cliche' Gangsta Garbage...I hated this cd so much...I threw it away..Literally in the Trash..Its nuttin but Shoot em up I'll kill u, Sellin drugs or doin drugs.. A buncha Stupid Love Songs And thats pretty much the Gist of 50's Talent..NO HIP HOP IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD...50 cent is everything thats wrong wit this world...I hate to judge him but he's not deliverin a message i can support, Neither is anybody else in G-Unit.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|this season was almost better than the first! the second half was BRILLIANT! the season finale is out of this world. The acting is awesome, way better than last season. Music is great as always, and storylines juicier than ever! BRILLIANT stuff!
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is a great CD.  I really think they took their time to make another CD.  Not just pump another one out because it was time... and a lot of bands do this.. and eventually bankrupt their fanbase..<br /><br />It was time.  And this band is very powerful.  I am glad to hear that AS will be playing songs from both RATM and SG on the tour coming up.<br /><br />As far as the songs on this CD go, my far and away favorite song so far has been 'Doesn't Remind Me'... this nhilistic song is quite good.. and I really love the twisted morality that goes quite well with the twisted guitar solo.<br /><br />But prepare yourself, this is a very hybred, hi octane rock outfit.. and they don't always color inside the lines... which is what makes all great bands even greater.<br /><br />I really love this CD.<br /><br />Have fun
0375703861|4.0|Given the amount of hype when this novel came out, it was never going to live up to all of it... however, it comes close! <br /> <br />It's a bold novel with a highly creative storyline which darts back & forth over a period of 50 years.  The characters are all exaggerations or parodies, which is absolutely essential to the daring style of the book.  Reading previous reviews, I seem to be in the minority of preferring the 2nd half of the book, which I finished far more quickly than the 1st.  I think this is due to the characters being more fully developed, allowing me to more enjoy the zany style of writing. <br /> <br />Smith is clearly extremely intelligent & talented, however this is the source of my main criticism.  The writing does feel extremely self-conscious, as if she's trying to produce a virtuoso showpiece rather than letting the work speak for itself. The desire to continually go off on tangents to demonstrate her knowledge of the English language, history, and science is ultimately at the expense of the prose (maybe she's read too many Salman Rushdie novels!). I also don't think the whole \\"teeth\\" thing really works and seems to have been woven in just for the title! <br /> <br />Those criticisms aside, it is an excellent read and I look forward to reading more of her works.
B000784WMW|5.0|If you cherish Bronte's novel then you must have this DVD! The 4 hour version sufficed for 20 years but this is unedited & just as it should be in all it's glory . . . . Clarke & Dalton ARE Jane & Rochester. Unquestionably. And it's BBC period drama at it's best, timeless & faithful to the author. A beautiful piece of work for us all to be proud of. Buy it!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|This was by far the stupidest movie I've seen this year. Keanu Reeves proves yet once again that he's one of the authors of how to be a one-dimensional actor (see all the usually mediocre movies that he's done, such as Speed or one of The Matrix sequels if you don't believe me), second only to Vin Diesel (TWO DAYS. dUR-HUR-HUR!!1!111!!1!!). OK, I know I have slightly digressed and should return to the matter at hand. This movie is a desecration to the comic book, the action scenes were dumb almost to the point of sheer hilarity, that lady cop talked like a retard who got turned down from competing in the special olympics, that Satan dude looked gayer than Richard Simmon's shorts, and anyone who spent their hard-earned money to see this atrocity of a film should be entitled to a full refund.
B00097DX3U|5.0|No one makes sophomore albums like this anymore. While more mellow than the previous release, it's still Audioslave. I was afraid we wouldn't get another 'Cochise' or 'Like A Stone'.<br /><br />We didn't, we got something different and it's going to sound good for years to come. Get this album.
0060736267|5.0|I first read this book about five years ago while I was still in high school and I still find myself loving it just as much today. This is a great example of a coming of age book. Its a short read which makes it great for younger readers. But just because its short doesnt mean that there are not so many messages to take from this book. You see Francie grow from a nieve child to an educated adult. You sit with her as she suffers the heart ache that often hits us all at some point in life and show that life must go on. With so many books becoming a staple in high school education I find myself wondering how this book is not one of them. Showing that we all have it inside us to make it even under the worst of circumstances. A prime example of how the smallest seed can still manage to bloom into one of the greatest flowers.
1400031354|5.0|What a superb story McCall Smith tells in Tears of the Giraffe, and how beautifully he tells it. His No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is fast becoming one of my favorites. Simply told, gently written, and charming in its descriptions of the people and places in the Botswana of Precious Ramotswe, makes McCall Smith's approach to storytelling unique and refreshing.<br /><br />Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's only woman detective, and owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. However, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's maid, Florence Peko, is not at all happy with the news and conjures up some plans of her own for Mma Ramotswe. The main plot surrounds Mma Ramotswe's search for the son of an American woman who had been missing for ten years. The woman, Andrea Curtin, does not expect her son to be alive, but she does want to know what happened to him. Mrs (no period) Curtin's husband is now dead, and all previous efforts to find her son have failed, so she pays a visit to the agency. Add to that the troubles of Mr Letsenyane Badule who wants to know if his wife is having an affair, and we have the thrust of the book. Then there are the orphans, two of whom become very important in the lives of Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Its simple, straight-forward language, and its portrayal of the qualities of the Batswana (refers to the people), kept me enthralled. I was particularly struck by the fact that Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni were always referred to by this formal reference. More familiar forenames were never used. My only concern in reading this book was whether or not I was pronouncing names and places correctly-places like the Makadikadi Salt Pans, the town of Molepolole, and the names Tlokweng, Letsenyane and Sonqkwena, to name a few. If you read it, you will love it.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill
B000641Z90|1.0|Horrible audio! the volume floats up and down all the time. Too bad!
B000002H33|1.0|Let's just say that this record is lame. Only 10-year-olds fall for the simplistic arrangements (verse-chorus-verse-chorus) and the chewing-gum chatchy choruses. This is power-metal at its worst aimed at commercial success where lack of talent and greed is heard in every note played and in every word sung. If you want to follow the mass a.k.a pre-pubecent boys that has this record between their Limp Bizkit and their St.Anger, so be it, but if you value music a little bit more than that then feel proud if you haven't heard a single metallica song in your life.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Out of all of the editions of the trilogy I've seen, this is the best yet.   <br />The sound quality for \\"A New Hope\\" is a lot better than when I first watched it.  Back then, it just sounded like an old movie, but now, it sounds like it's just been made.  They've added bonus sceens, which I like, because it gives more meat to the story.  Vader's voice, is wonderfull, and they've redone sceens with the Emperor (my fave charactor).  All in all, this trilogy is well worth the 40 bucks I paid for it.  So just go on out and buy it.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Out of Exile is awesome. Audioslave has come back with a second album that put's the lowered bar back up where it belongs. Hopefully alot of other rock bands will follow this example, stop pussyfooting around and give us their best. <br />Thank you Audioslave.
0062502182|3.0|(...)    Coelho, one of pre-eminent novelists of Brazil, maintains a tradition of magical realism in this acclaimed and well sold book. It is a tale of young Santiago's journey. The physical journey takes him to many places in his own country, Spain as well as northern Africa and across the Sahara to the Pyramids where he seeks his fortune. His metaphysical journey is explained along with his travels. That journey is about his maturation and the insights he gains by his meeting so many fellow travelers. In this sense it is not unlike Candide.    The prose is beautiful and poignant. It makes the reader feel nearly dreamlike as Santiago, or \\"the boy\\" as he is usually referred to aspires to be a righteous man who does his duty while dreaming about what another life would be like. It reminds us of Paul Nizan's book of travels Aden Arabie. `To what end moving away?' is the question.    The prose, gorgeous as it is, represents a philosophy. Do we make our own decisions or let a supreme being make them. In this case it is a question of heeding the insight of strangers Santiago has met or relying on his own experience and intuition. Ultimately he uses a little of both. His quest is for romantic love but it is also to grow in wisdom and treasure.    He achieves his aims by heeding the seers he meets, talking to the wind and sand and sun. This is presented beautifully and reads well. It also is nonsense. This is a well phrased thoughtful book but the thoughts this reviewer came out with is that this is no way to achieve any dreams and hopes that he has.
B00000ILGL|5.0|Here is a Trick if you need better sound quality for this or any album or songs Use Adobe Audition and improve sound quality ** (you can do anything you want with the sound) either Burn normal cd or burn DVD-Audio , DVD Audio gives almost same quality as LP.s i redid my whole collection of all old songs and albums i still enjoy 70;s and 80's Music with HIGH quality Sound , as far Giogio Moroder is Concern i have his all songs , these songs takes me back my teenage days and still miss those days ...... <br /> <br />Happy Listning
B00005Q45W|5.0|At 67, Leonard Cohen follows the monumental \\"The Future\\" with another astonishing release.    As already mentioned by others, this is as much Sharon Robinson's album as Cohen's. If, as some have said, the music sounds like it was played on one of those old Atari or Casio keyboards or a sequencer, then great, because it all works. The instrumental aspects of this album are simple and understated, a case of (a lot) less is definitely (a lot) more.    The vocals show Cohen on as good as form as his voice will ever get. The harmonies of Sharon Robinson add warmth and give the whole a beauty and lustre, so much so that it is a masterpiece.    \\"The Future\\" will not be beaten. As an album, it is, in my opinion, Cohen's greatest - and that's saying something when one consider's the brilliance of his previous albums. But on this, \\"By The Rivers Dark\\" is the absolute greatest Cohen song I have ever heard. It is a gem - and one of my favourite songs of all-time. Another reviewer suggests you will want to listen to it over and over again. Too true - it's been on repeat for the last hour and I hear something new every time I hear it. It sends a tingle down my spine!    Others which make this another memorable album are \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\", \\"Here It Is\\" and \\"Boogie Street\\", but the simplicity of the music and Cohen downbeat lyrics mean that there is something special in all these ten new songs.    A wonderful album - can Cohen do no wrong? I doubt it!
0671027387|4.0|As I read this book I felt like I was reading a Hollywood script.  Everything, from the action sequences to the behind the scenes conspiracy, right down to the ending of the book screamed &quot;Make me into a movie!&quot;  And that's a shame too, because if Dan Brown had spent a little more time in flushing out some of the plot holes in the book (and there are many) he could have developed another stellar novel.  Instead, you're left with a novel which could just as easily have been written by Michael Crichton or John Grisham.<br />The premise of the novel is straight forward enough.  A fantastic discovery takes place in the arctic and through the course of scientific validation, the main protagonists get drawn into a tightly woven conspiracy.  This is formulaic novel material and Dan Brown manages to pull it off with the best off them.  And although his scientific and military descriptions are authentic enough, his story presents itself with too much flash and not enough substance for the reader to suspend any of their disbelief.<br />And this later point, about the suspension of disbelief, is what makes Brown's other novel The Da Vinci Code such a great read.  Try as he might, Brown just cannot replicate the mystery that he managed to do with is previous outting.<br />I don't want to spoil the book so I'll refrain from saying anything else at this point.  However if you are reading this book in hopes of a Da Vinci Code part II, you will be sadly disapointed.  But if you like quick reads that don't involve a lot of thinking to be done on the part of the reader, then this book is for you.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is the best movie I had ever seen in my life.My words run dry and astonished by the dreamlike atmosphere Webber created. I think the Phantom was the most impressive figure I have ever seen in any movies. His passionate but desperate voice makes the tragic hero even more rivetted. And Wilson also did a good job as that handsome Raoul,although he looks a little bit naive. The dress he wore on the masquerade remind me a scene of &lt;&lt; The Beauty and The Beast>>. If I were Christine, I really cannot make a decision between the Phantom and Raoul. I think the Phantom is a half of her life, without him, she will never singing like an angel again. The last scene made me cry more than once. When the rose with black ribbon appeared on Christine's tomb, I know the love of the Phantom is perpetuated and even deeper than Raoul's. I am speechless now, I love the story so much, it is the most heart broken story in the world! Bravo! Bravo!
B00097DX3U|4.0|I like a good heavy rock song as much as the next guy, and Audioslave supplies a lot of those on Out of Exile.  For example, something like \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" is a powerful piece of music, complete with head-banging guitar riffs and a muscular lead vocal by Chris Cornell.  But what's unique and excellent about Audioslave is how they write and perform actual melodies, and they also have the ability to mix in a variety of volumes and tempos.  It's not just all full-gale hurricane all of the time.  Even on the same mighty tune, \\"Drown Me Slowly,\\" there is a slower, softer bridge with Cornell almost crooning.  And the very next song, \\"Heavens Dead,\\" is bit more down-tempo (while still possessing its share of hard rhythms and crunching electric guitars).  I came to this \\"Rage Against The Garden\\" band from the Soundgarden side, and I always liked the 'Garden's ability to mix it up, as shown on a slower but still very strong song like \\"Black Hole Sun.\\"  Audioslave has got the same kind of mojo working with their material.  It's a great listen, from a very solid bunch of musicians.
6305095442|5.0|Fun, unconventional horror/comedy, focusing more over style and inventiveness rather than logic and trite, mainstream pitfalls. This film is much like a cartoon, Raimi's tribute to The 3 Stooges, with Bruce Campbell doing a splendid job at making us laugh -- while covered in blood. <br /> <br />Many have complained about the story, explaining that it is shallow and underwritten. This isn't so. It's written to do one thing: make way for fun, creative wackiness. And it's full of imagination, full of emotion, full of life. Also, in the end, we care for Ash, and want to see more of him. Now is that bad writing? To care for the film's main character?  <br /> <br />This film is told not through words from the screenplay, but by the images from the camera. <br /> <br />In a way this can be seen as an \\"Art\\" film, because of how unconventional it is, and maybe it's just.  <br /> <br />Artists and experimental fans will find this film enjoyable.  <br /> <br />I did (^_^) <br />
B00005AR3G|5.0|Five stars you bet!  The funniest Disney move in LONG time, and for once something that doesn't focus on death (as it seems a lot of Disney does.)  My kids love it as much as I do.  Witty humor for adults and silly stuff for the kids.  David Spade is absolutely perfect for this role and how could you not love Puddy (from Seinfeld) as Cronk!  Buy it before it goes in the Disney vault.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Just when you think that these guys would come up with a sophomore album that sound just like the first one (that being full on hard rock), they deliver a more diverse album, with different textures, deeper lyrics, and on top of all things, they now sound much more compact as a band, its like they enjoy being with each other, they love the music they made, and it shows.<br /><br />In other words Audioslave its evolving, and thats always a good thing, for them, and for us fans...so enjoy this album...It's evolution baby!!!
B00097DX3U|4.0|I woke up this morning and hopped on my motorcycle to speed down to get the new album before work.  <br /> <br />I am satisfied for my $15 spent, but it doesn't have that feeling of the band grabbing you through the headphones and kicking your ass with some hard rock as their Audioslave CD did, but hey, bands mature and this is what happens.  <br /> <br />They're still a solid band, wish I could've been in their sold-out concert here in Seattle (which sold out in 2 minutes after it went on sale online/phones/venue)!! <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of great tracks on this disc. Chris uses his higher tone of voice more often, which is not bad, but the deeper tones from the first album was amazing with the rage tunes. <br /> <br />If you have the first album and it kicked your ass, get this album. You'll still bang your head to it. Trust me....
B000002LND|3.0|The Immaculate Collection is a must for any Madonna fan, and features most of her more popular songs from the first 7-8 years of her well-known career.   <br /> <br />However, TIC has some quirks to it. <br /> <br />The most noticeable one is that several of the songs are kind of butchered up; Open Your Heart is the one that first comes to mind. Segments are cut out of some of the songs and several of them feel \\"incomplete\\". (If you are accustomed to the original versions) <br /> <br />There are some other things too.  The Immaculate Collection uses remixed versions of Like a Prayer and Express Yourself.   <br /> <br />I personally can't stand the mix of Like a Prayer.  The original 1989 album version sounds so much better, and has the awesome funk accompanying the main chorus of the song, as well as the powerful choir in all its glory.  The mix of Like a Prayer on The Immaculate Collection just comes off as sounding silly, and it seems like they got rid of the original version's best qualities. <br /> <br />I prefer the album version of Express Yourself as well, once again because I find TIC version annoying, while the original has the nice bass sound to it.  <br /> <br />There are also some popular songs missing from The Immaculate Collection, like Who's That Girl and True Blue.  (I think Dress You Up should have been on here too, but that's a little fav. of mine) I guess we just have to remember this isn't necessarily a greatest hits album. :) <br /> <br />TIC does manage to finish off strong with Vogue, Justify My Love, and the unique Rescue Me.    <br /> <br />To sum it all up like I said above, The Immaculate Collection is a good buy for any Madonna fan, but I recommend just buying the singles if you are interested in only a few songs on this album, due to the \\"quirks\\" here and there.   <br />
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Tedious and very funny Keanu Reeves horror movie that lacks not only the thrills but also a real story with an actual plot in it. The dialog is horrendously bad with scenes that actually has nothing to do with the story being told and characters that adds nothing to the overall story at all. Keanu Reeves is painfully miscast as the occult detective John Constantine and the direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is spotty at best. The screenplay is a jumbled mess and it contradicts itself in certain scenes of the film and some of the performances are not up to par. There is some good in the film and that is mostly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, and she does more for it than the movie does for her. I actually cared about her character more than I cared about John Constantine and if I were the screenwriter of this movie, I would have cut John out altogether and just focus the movie on her. For one, it would have cut about half of the unnecessary characters that is in the film but also might have made the movie more focus in its plot because her character has more of a reason of being in the movie than Keanu's, who is just there for the mandatory overblown climax, which in itself incoherent because it raises more questions than the movie wants to answer. <br /> <br />I agree with the majority, see it for Rachel Weisz great performance only but don't expect the film to be as great as she was.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Carey has proven to us for some time now, that she is able to make it in the Urban Genre.  Some may criticize her for this decision,having moved from Adult Contemporary ballads and all. Carey herself has claimed that her true expression is in Urban.   However, it's time for this well rounded artist to move on.  Her grasp onto Urban style is getting monotonous and isn't very sharp.  Her songs do not grasp us viscerally.   <br /> <br />One thing that I find admirable is Carey's abilities to write her own material lyrically.  Makes you miss her collaborative days With Walter Afanasieff.  With Afanasieff's composition and Carey's lyric's, the product proved much success.   What ever happened? <br /> <br />This ablum, though techinally proficient, lacks substance.   \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" I would describe as Urban Blase.
B000001Y5J|3.0|When I first got \\"Broken\\" years ago, I thought it was brilliant-- I was young, somewhat isolated, and angry, it worked well for me.  In the intervening years, I've discovered its not really quite the record I thought it was.  Reznor was evidentally having a pretty bad time with a lot at this time, and he composed a slab of white hot anger-- there's really nothing else at all to it but that.  Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when you're not there, it gets monotonous at times. <br /> <br />Mind you, at some point last year, I was angry and felt betrayed, and I put on \\"Broken\\", and it worked for me, but since I've gotten over that anger, it hasn't worked as well again (on a side note, as I was 26 at the time, the line \\"no new tale to tell, 26 years, on my way to hell\\" seemed to have an odd resonance...). <br /> <br />Still, its got its moments-- \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\" is fantastic, a slice of calm admist the storm of the piece, and as far as blasts of pure anger go, they really get no better than \\"Wish\\".  The rest of the EP proper is ok, \\"Gave Up\\" I used to really love until I saw Reznor do it live and suddenly the version on record, which struck me as quite a bit overproduced didn't work well for me, and \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" I just find downright annoying. <br /> <br />This one's been released in two forms, with a 3\\" single accompanying it, with a whole bunch of blank tracks after the EP itself (six songs), or as just eight tracks.  The bonus material (however its in there) is two pieces-- a cover of Adam and the Ant's \\"Physical\\" anda Pigface's \\"Suck\\" (which Reznor did with that group).  The former is sort of the next step of the \\"Sin\\" single cover of \\"Get Down Make Love\\"-- it also clearly points the way to the future, oozing with a bizarre sensuality even as it maintains a feel of anger and torment.  \\"Suck\\" is closer in mood to the \\"Broken\\" tracks, though a bit more varied, with a nice funky bassline. <br /> <br />\\"Broken\\" is a great piece when you're inthe right mood, but it lacks the subtlety and depth of Reznor's later work.

B000003TA4|5.0|I just wasted ten minutes of my life reading the review below from \\"Velvet Underground Pixies\\" about how everything Kurt did was a \\"rip-off\\" of somebody that he liked, and how everything Eddie Vedder has ever done is \\"real\\" and \\"truth\\".  So...    First off, Pearl Jam only exists because Andrew Wood is dead.    Andrew Wood was TEN TIMES the singer Eddie Vedder is.  Andy's lyrics run circles around Vedder's all day long.    Andy didn't care who thought what of him, he wanted to be a rockstar and didn't care who knew.  Vedder can't flush his own feces down the toilet without worrying about if he just sold-out because everyone else flushes the toilet too.    But this isn't about Mother Love Bone (superior band) and Pearl Jam (inferior), this is about Nirvana (far superior).    Nevermind isn't as good an album as In Utero.      I prefer In Utero's raw emotion, but Nevermind would be most any other band's crowning achievement (and there could have been no In Utero without a Nevermind before it).    Kurt Cobain, like most human beings, was influenced by things that he heard, saw, smelled, touched etc.  The Pixies being one of the bands that Kurt was influenced by.  He was also influenced by the Beatles, Black Sabbath, Vaselines, Cheap Trick, the Germs (you're starting to get the point).    To call Nirvana a blatant rip-off of the Pixies is like calling Mountain Dew a blatant rip-off of water.  The Pixies were great, don't get me wrong, but just because they came first and were less popular doesn't mean they're better.  If older automatically means better, we all better start worshipping the caveman who started bashing two rocks together to make noise.    I'm sorry that the Pixies guy below me feels so threatened by Nirvana's music that he has to discredit everything they accomplished.  Kurt Cobain did more with three chords than anyone ever will, but it was the feeling he put into his songs that made them powerful.      I miss watching Nirvana tear into a song like wolvesinto meat, hearing Kurt scream like he was being beaten, feeling the intense sensation of knowing that I'm not the only person in the world who feels these ways sometimes.    Kurt Cobain caught wind of a good idea and turned it into something more powerful than we have ever heard, and every indie music fan wants to crucify him for it?  That's horses**t, it was cool to listen to Bleach in art class but once it reaches a certain amount of people it loses credibility?  What a confining way to live...I pity you.    If you are considering purchasing Nevermind, ask yourself if you like powerful music, something that is going to make you feel and think, something that will trigger something inside you (and it's different for everybody).    And maybe check out Mother Love Bone too.    P.S. Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament WANTED to be rock stars and then decided they didn't like it after Ten came out, so don't buy into the \\"Pearl Jam hated stardom from the beginning\\" stuff.
