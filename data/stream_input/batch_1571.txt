B000O8OTNC|4.0|Okay, I want to preface this review by stating that I know next-to-nothing about sharpening knives.  Apparently, knife sharpening is an art, and it's an art I know nothing about.<br /><br />After reading a bunch of reviews on various sharpeners, I chose this one.  It seemed simple and user-friendly, which is what I needed.  I have a drawer of kitchen knives that haven't been sharp for a very long time, and a couple of pocket knives I wanted to sharpen up.<br /><br />My kitchen knives are not anything special and on the cheap-side of knives.  This sharpener did a very good job of sharpening them up (I tested them on paper, I saw some guy on youtube do it).  The little stick-sharpener did a nice job on a serrated knife as well.  The process was very quick, I probably pulled the knife through 10-15 times and got very good results.<br /><br />This was less effective on a couple of cheap pocket knives I have.  Now, I'm not sure if these knives were ever even sharp to begin with or if that matters, but I worked on one forever with no real difference.  After about 50 pulls through, I gave up.  I don't know if the knife is just too dull to be helped, or if I'm commiting some kind of user-error, but, it would not sharpen the cheap pocket knives.<br /><br />So, 4-stars.  Definitely worth the price considering it did a nice job on my kitchen knives.  Super-easy to use for a knife-novice like me.

0439023521|4.0|I heard a ton about The Hunger Games before I read it. A lot of people said it was really gruesome and intense--even more people said it was sad and heartbreaking. Personally, I didn't think it was particularly gruesome or heartbreaking. It felt like \\"Survivor\\" meets Lord of The Flies and the myth of the Minotaur. My familiarity with similar types of stories and knowledge about the plot going into the story contributed to my lack of shock while reading The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Even though a lot of people thought that The Hunger Games was really gruesome, the fight scenes were not described in too much detail, so this was not a problem for me. The overall concept is, of course, appalling--but that is the point of the novel. No one goes into Lord of the Flies expecting it to be an uplifting story, and no one should go into The Hunger Games expecting a story filled with joy.<br /><br />The deaths and tragedies of the story weren't particularly upsetting to me either. The majority of the players in the games weren't very developed. There was only one character that dies that I cared about, but I knew she was going to die so I did not let myself get too attached to her character.<br /><br />The best part of the novel for me was definitely Peeta and Katniss. It was a joy to see their interactions. You can tell that Peeta truly loves Katniss, and even though Katniss is just playing the game, there is clearly potential for something beautiful to develop there.<br /><br />Filled with the makings of a beautiful love story, a tragedy torn nation, and a lot of action, The Hunger Games is definitely a must read. Perfect for fans of \\"Survivor,\\" Lord of The Flies, and the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, The Hunger Games has enough action and romance to leave you wanting more.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This video series enables a depth of understanding not customarily found in movies about World War II.<br />Sharing of memories by veterans who were at the areas depicted in the story gives a realism to the stories about that particular area that is not commonly found.  The BAND OF BROTHERS video I purchased from Amazon is a worthwhile addition to any video library.

0132350882|2.0|The first chapter is amazing.  It gets you pumped to learn how to write clean code.  Then as you read more chapters, you realize this guy is out of his mind.  He has good intentions but his advice is impractical.  His obsession with functions being 2-3 lines long only and no more than 2-3 arguments is like saying politicians shouldn't lie.  To follow his rules will require you to turn a simple, clean application into a gigantic mess of 5 thousand classes and 10 million functions.
B002C6K7N0|1.0|Reading the reviews, I thought this would be an awesome album.  The start was OK speed metal, then Endgame was OK, and so was the album ender.  3 just OK songs to me is not worth it.  I guess I am too spoiled by groups like Iron Maiden.

B000001FSP|5.0|\\"Broken English\\" was released in 1979, long after anyone expected to hear anything more from Marianne Faithfull, who had been categorized as a one hit wonder with the bland \\"As Tears Go By.\\" And there it was, dark, dark.  A Time magazine reviewer had called her later [[ASIN:B000001FU0 Strange Weather]], upon its 1987 release, `music to slit your wrists to.'  But the same might well have been said of BROKEN ENGLISH, except for the shock factor.  Gone was Faithfull's bland chorister's voice, replaced by one that had been damaged by smoking various substances, drink, drugs, and riotous living.  And it had become stronger; both albums were great critical favorites.<br /><br />As an album, BROKEN is unique, to my knowledge, in one odd way: there are so few songs on it.  But they are among Faithfull's most famous, and they constitute her signature album.  She herself has called it, in her autobiography, her masterpiece.  The songs are of loss, disillusionment, the backing tight, edgy, punky.  Her voice is, of course, now like nobody else's, and neither is the sound of her backing  group, consisting on this record of Diane Birch, Frankie Collins, Jim Cuomo, Guy Humphries, Joe Mavety, Maurice Pert, Barry Reynolds, Terry Stannard, Darryl Way, Steve Winwood, and Steve York.  Shel Silverstein's \\"Ballad of Lucy Jordan,\\" of a suburban housewife, who's had it with her starveling life, has never been done better.  John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\" could match its writer for bite.  The title song, \\"Broken English,\\" written by Faithfull and her frequent collaborator Barry Reynolds, with her backing musicians, Joe Mavety, Steve York and Terry Stannard, is as fresh today as the day it was written.  As is \\"Witches Song\\" by the same team.  \\"Guilt,\\" by Barry Reynolds, has stood the test of time.  But all the chat and outrage at the time, of course, was Faithfull's XXX reaction to a partner's infidelity: \\"Why D'Ya Do It,\\" based on a poem by Heathcote Williams, written by Faithfull and the same team of musicians.<br /><br />Marianne Faithfull has had a remarkably long singing career; the British songster started out in the 1960's as the pretty girlfriend of Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones, and in 1964 delivered her pretty, tinkling version of \\"As Tears Go By,\\" written for her by Jagger and Keith Richards, also of The Stones.<br /><br />The Hollies, British rock group, wrote their 1960's hit song \\"Hey Carrie Ann, Now what's Your Game\\" about her, changing the name only slightly to protect the not-so-innocent. If there's one thing for sure, she was at the heart of London during its swinging sixties. As they say, men wanted her, women wanted to be her: though, let's face it, quite a few women probably wanted her too. But, between her sweet teenaged hit and the present day, quite a few tears have gone by for Faithfull, convent-educated daughter of an Austrian countess. She descended into homeless drug addiction, and stayed there for a long time before, with the help of her son, she was able to pull herself out.<br /><br />These days Faithfull is producing a lot of music and she tours. I've been lucky enough to catch her several times, most memorably as she introduced [[ASIN:B00000BIIK Weill: The Seven Deadly Sins and other Songs]], based on the work of famed German composer Bertolt Brecht's \\"Seven Deadly Sins.\\" This was in New York: at Brooklyn's historic Brooklyn Academy of Music. And as she introduced [[ASIN:B000001FVB Blazing Away: Live]], also in Brooklyn, at Saint Ann's.  (I've reviewed this album in these pages.)  The artist has written an autobiography, [[ASIN:0815410468 Faithfull: An Autobiography]] that I have also read and reviewed in these pages.  She acts, too.  Most notably, you might catch her as the feminist God in the British television comedy series,[[ASIN:B000UNYPGM Absolutely Fabulous: Absolutely Everything]]. She is one of the finest art rock singers now working, but, firstly, you'd better appreciate rock to appreciate her. And furthermore, a warning to the sensitive; on this album she uses some language you just may never have heard a woman using before, let alone on record.  It is strong stuff, but it is magnificent.hermore, a warning to the sensitive; on this album she uses some language you just may never have heard a woman using before, let alone on record.

0307346617|1.0|I couldn't wait to read this book after hearing such good things about it. However, it was a big letdown. There is no purpose or connection with the characters. It also feels like the author is expressing his political views through the characters. I hate that. This is a work of fiction not a political manifesto.

1400049628|5.0|The \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" is a fictional help manual dealing with the bizarre potentiality of a zombie attack. Author Max Brooks published this inclusive protection handbook in 2003, which then landed a spot on the New York Times Bestseller list. The book is so carefully laid out, with every possible scenario considered, and multiple strategically designed tactics from Plan A, Plan B, to Plan C. There are back up plans for back up plans, that it is literally a \\"how to survive ZOMBIES for DUMMIES\\". There are six knowledgeable chapters including \\"The Undead: Myths and Realities\\" which explains all that we should know, think we know, and what we don't know about zombies. The myth of the Solanum virus, and how it possibly came about. Known attributes of zombies such as their physiology and behavior. Also possible ways to detect any outbreaks. The book also goes into detail on how the virus is spread and how to detect an outbreak if such events were to happen. A different focus in the book is a very educational chapter on \\"Weapons and Combat techniques\\" that cover all basic and abnormal weapons. It explains how to use and clean them, as well as which ones are more beneficial or absolutely useless in certain situations. Other chapters include tactics on how to defend your home and/or another \\"safe haven\\", and what you should do if you are forced to flee and are now on the run. Of course including information on what kind of equipment is necessary, the high and lows that are offered in different terrain types, transportation, many possible strategies and much more useful information. The last chapter consists of what it might be like should the world become overruled with the \\"undead\\", and how you are to continue living your life once you \\"start over\\".<br />The book then ends with a number of fictional \\"attacks\\" that have been recorded throughout history, starting in 60,000 BC, all the way to a more recent attack to 2002. Brooks also gives us a simple summary to his book, just in case you're not able to remember everything it has to offer with his \\"Top Ten Lessons for Surviving a Zombie Attack\\" 1. Organize before the rise. 2. They feel no fear, why should you. 3. Use your head, cut off theirs. 4. Blades don't need reloading. 5. Ideal protection = tight clothes, short hair. 6. Get up the staircase, then destroy it. 7. Get out of the car, get onto the bike, 8. Keep moving, keep low, keep quiet, keep alert! 9. No place is safe, only safer, 10. The zombie may be gone, but the threat lives on.<br />This book is designed as the key to your survival from the undead and presents trustworthy tips and rules to live by in order to keep you and others safe from being turned into a human eating monster, or dying a most disturbing and painful death. Ultimately, \\"this is a book that can save your life\\". If interested, you can find sanctuary from any zombie threat under book genres like zombies, fiction, horror, and humor.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The first word that came to mind as I finished the last chapter was WOW!!  I stayed up late the last few nights because I just couldn't put this book down!  The format goes between the voices of the two main characters every chapter changes from Nick to Amy.  The author does an outstanding job with this writing style that keeps the reader hooked.<br /><br />Amy and Nick fall in love and have a great life in NYC.  Amy has a significant trust fund thanks to her parent's nationally acclaimed children's book series \\"Amazing Amy\\" about a perfect child based on Amy.  Nick, a twin,  grew up in the mid-west.  But as the economy turns in 2008, the magazine writers both find themselves unemployed.  Amy's parents are in financial straits and borrow the majority of the trust fund.  Nick's parents are in poor health, so Nick decides that the couple will move back to the mid-West to help his twin sister take care of his ailing parents.  Amy wasn't happy about this change, having lived her life in NY, but she goes along as the good wife.<br /><br />The couple is miserable after their move, neither feeling valued by their respective spouse, and they grow apart.  Then, Amy disappears on their 5th anniversary.  After a few days, Nick is clearly the main suspect.  Amy's anniversary tradition is to create a series of clues for Nick to hunt for his anniversary present.  It is a ritual that Nick hates and that he is not very good at.  However, the police find the first clue and Nick is determined to find Amy.  After he finds all of the pieces the clues all have a double meaning, at first, Nick falls in love with Amy all over again, then he thinks that Amy is trying to set up Nick for her disappearance.  He realizes that she is in fact alive, all the while, the walls are closing in on innocent Nick as more and more circumstantial evidence mounts making him look like the suspect of her murder.<br /><br />Amy is deceptive and set up Nick to appear that he has murdered her.  She creates a web of lies, uses characters from her past to unknowingly help her psychotic ways.  While she does come back, looking like a hero and exonerating Nick, the ending is not what I expected and a little unsettling.<br /><br />Go Girl is full of twists and turns and it is hard to put down.  It is a unique thriller of power, control, and ultimately a psychotic game.  The characters are well developed.  It is a great book, a really fast read, and one that you won't forget!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion Bible app for kindle fire loads and runs fairly cleanly. Many English translation are available. There were a couple of Russian translations. The Greek Koine SBL needs some font help. The Church Slavonic was a nice surprise even though using modern script. I've enjoyed using the reading plans. The LIVE feature is cool being able to get service notes. A good app comparable to Olive Tree but not as complete as Bibleworks or Logos.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Only rented it because of all the positive reviews on Amazon but, while watching this movie I realized the Positive reviews had to be fake.

B0088749CW|4.0|This crime/drama/mystery starts out with glass being picked out of Julie's face (Jessica Biel) then we flashback 36 hours to briefly build character. Cold Rock, Washington is a dead mining town where children frequently go missing. The town folk blame the \\"Tall Man.\\" Julie is a nurse who runs the community clinic. She has taken over for her husband who was a doctor.<br /><br />During this time we are introduced to Tracy (Samantha Ferris), her biker boyfriend Steven (Teach Grant), and her two teen daughters Carol (Katherine Ramdeen) who recently had a child by Steven, and Jenny (Jodelle Ferland) a self imposed mute who has seen the Tall Man. When Julie's son David is abducted, mom springs into action without thought for her personal safety.<br /><br />Then the movie turns weird. We discover that the town's police car rear doors can open from the inside and poverty is a cycle that results from a broken system. The twist caught me off guard which is why I liked the film. In fact it flashes back and let's you see the clues, in case you missed them. The film raises social questions, but doesn't supply definitive answers. Good acting. Well written. I liked how the story developed. It spent just a touch too much making social comments, rather than just have the film speak for itself.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: F-Bomb, no nudity, no sex.

B004PQFI5C|5.0|I saw this film when it came out and found it thoroughly heart warming. What I missed was Greg Kinnear's finely turned performance as the father. True he was nine years older than when he turned in his Oscar nominated Best Supporting Actor performance in \\"As Good As It Gets.\\" It was easy to overlook his performance there in favor of his model good looks. But seeing the film again recently, he accomplishes a marvel portraying a gentle but not effeminate Gay man who is totally devoted to his work as an artist. Fast forward nine years to \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\" He is now forty six and well into middle age. The good looks are blunted but still there. He is now portraying a father just as convincingly as he portrayed a drop dead gorgeous young Gay man. The two performances are an object lesson in acting which submerges the actor completely into the character. For comparable subtlety and skill I can think of only Meryl Streep. It's time this phenomenally gifted actor received the parts and recognition he deserves! \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a wonderful film, but try watching it with your attention focused on Kinnear. It's a revelation.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the whole series last week and was not very impressed.  I just felt the whole time like it was so incredibly unrealistic.  There was not one scenario that I thought was reasonable or even likely to happen to anyone anywhere anytime.  Every single detail was over maximized.  I swear, Twilight was less unrealistic - vampires included.  However, I took a notion last night to watch the 1998 Thomas Crown Affair - uhhhh....Half of the books scenes were stolen from the movie script.<br />1. Thomas Crown is a megasomethingaire who owns his building where is conducts an extremely successful mergers and acquisitions company<br />2. Thomas Crown is single, overly hot, extremely egotistical, adventurous and can't form stable relationships with women<br />3. Thomas Crown has a phsyciatrist that he sees on a regular basis who helps steer him through his interpersonal relationships<br />4. Thomas Crown is from an extremely humble background with no family and had to fight his way - literally - to the top<br />5. Thomas Crown lives with a manserevant who cooks all of his meals and provides personal security, and he gets driven everywhere<br />6. Thomas Crown finds himself in a dangerous new relationship with a woman who challenges everything about him<br />7. Stolen Scenes - - The Gilder Scene - it is identical to the one in the book - inclduing the \\"flip\\" performed<br />The list could go on and on - go check out the movie and you might feel like a good bit of plagarism has taken place.....<br /><br />I actually would have given the book 3 stars before I saw the movie.  Now I just feel cheated and annoyed.
B005LAIGP0|3.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Young lawyer Arthur Kipps is a widower with a young son. After he is dispatched to a remote village by his employer, he discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />If you can ignore the barrage of haunted house cliches, this old school ghost story has some genuine chills. `The Woman in Black' is based on the 1983 Susan Hill book of the same name and is also an on going play in London's West End. The dark tone is set right from the start as three young girls having an innocent tea party, get up in a trance, walk to the window and jump to their deaths...woah! That tea is some strong shit!. But it quickly becomes clear that this movie isn't about powerful hallucinates, it's about a pissed off dead lady who hates kids. As `The Woman in Black's' vengeance is slowly revealed, so are the cliches; rocking chairs, freaky porcelain dolls, ghostly children, dark corridors and window apparitions, just to name a few. The thrills come mainly from a handful of jump-out scares, which are sharpened thanks to some nice pacing and lighting. Daniel Radcliffe is also sharp, this is his first role since `Harry Potter' and he shows some serious emotion as a young father and widower, he tackles the role with plenty of maturity and seems well beyond his 22 years. `The Woman in Black' may not shock serious horror buffs, but the jump-out scares will guarantee a close quarter nestle from your lady.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The dark ominous atmosphere stays consistent throughout the film.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The vehicle driven by Ciaran Hinds's character is a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost.
0345803485|4.0|Yes its a book and yes it's not real. I was reading all of the reviews and people are really upset about \\"A Book\\". I personally like reading it, it was fun and exciting, who hasn't had dreams about having kinky sex with a rich man, come on people it was a fun book, so yes I enjoyed it very much!
B0079K4WMG|4.0|A very original movie, a little quirky, some great acting and utterly thought provoking. A love story set in a fictional global epidemic. The message is, which of your 5 senses are the most important to you in order to make you feel love and feel alive? Maybe all? Maybe just a couple? Or maybe none? Maybe all you need is compassion, understanding, forgiveness, respect and warmth.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book!  I felt like it was a more polished 50 shades type of book, written by a more experienced author.  It didn't have all of the same kinky elements that 50 did, but it managed to be even hotter, so that's just fine!  I really liked the characters, and I felt like it made a lot of sense that they would be drawn to each other, given their pasts.  I am really hoping this is a new type of romance sub-genre, with a lot more kink than your run-of-the-mill romance, but that is still just about a very touching love story between two people.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|Great book for those interested in the beer making process but also very helpful for the seasoned brewer.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves beer.
0345803485|5.0|I saw the mixed reviews, and I wasn't at all surprised by them.  Like most of the women in America, I read this book because almost every woman I know was talking about it.  I gave it five stars not because it was the most polished book I've ever read, but because I just adored the love story at it's core, and I honestly couldn't put it down.  I like the romance genre, but I have always had mixed feelings about the sub-genre of erotica.  The reason for this was that the erotica seems to be only about sex and often nothing to do with the emotions behind it.  I would really love to see more books that are this steamy but have a great love story at their core.  That's why i recommend this book!
0307887448|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. I couldn't put this one down. Well I couldn't turn it off since it was the audio version. Do you love the 80's movies, video games, music, movies? Even if you don't I think you will still love it, I couldn't get enough. I listen to the whole thing in one sitting. I was up till noon the next day and I've never done that with a book before. Also, Wil Wheaton does a great job as a narrator. I got sucked in and didn't want it to end. I believe that a movie is in the works as well which will rock. I love this book! Read it! Do it!
B005LAIH9A|4.0|So it looks like the gang from American Pie is back for another round!<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />So Jim and Michelle are having marital problems, sex has become something that they don't do often because they have careers and a child that take up most of their time.  Oz is a sports announcer guy that is on an ESPN knock off, Stiffler is a temp working for some financial firm, Kevin is a stay at home husband, and Finch is traveling the world, or so he says, but he's really an assistant manager of a Staples in New Jersey.<br /><br />We get the usual gags of Stiffler doing crazy things, Jim ending up in crazy situations that he has to explain himself out of and ends up having to make a big emotional heartfelt speech in order to get out of.<br /><br />We also find out that Oz only wants to get back with the girl he fell in love with back in high school.  Kevin just wants to remain friends with Vicki, his first love, Stiffler just wants to keep partying and getting laid, Finch just wants people to think he is cool and find true love.<br /><br />Of course we get the obligatory topless scenes and we also have a scene where we see Jim's junk, which I could have done without.<br /><br />Also we get lots of cameos from our old favorites, Nadia, the Shermanator, Stiffler's mom, Jessica, and the MILF guys are back as well.  They all come together and make us laugh and make us remember how much fun we had with these movies back when they were just a trilogy and something that defined our teenage and college years.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed watching the American Pie movies will enjoy watching this latest installment of the franchise and will be reminded of the good times we had back in the late ninety's and the early 2000's.  Check it out!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Maybe I'm the ideal reader for this book: a writer who has lived in New York, who has spent a lot of time in San Francisco, and who has partied like and known the despair of Egan's characters. I was born in 1963, which aligns me with, maybe, Benny. The author treats each difficult person with love, as a benevolent Creator should. The experimental elements (chapters in first, second, and third person; a Powerpoint chapter) worked, IMO.<br /><br />It reminded me of John Irving doing Joan Didion, or the other way around: wacky like Irving, deadpan like Didion, insightful of our time like both.. It also reminded me a bit of Tama Janowitz's Slaves of New York, because of the number of characters and how each chapter can work on its own as a short story. The scope also reminded me of Middlemarch.<br /><br />I highlighted liberally because there were so many great phrases. One that comes to mind was a description of drinking liquor and coffee at the same time: \\"Ted deliberated this question while downing three espressos in the hotel lobby, letting the caffeine and vodka greet in his brain like fighting fish.\\" Brilliant. It also enriched my vocabulary: badinage, debouchment, judder, and more.<br /><br />Her acedemic-ization of concepts is amusing and insightful. Her explanation of how everyone can know something at once is apt. It straddles the line between literary fiction and sci-fi in places. (Is there a line anymore, after Cloud Atlas?)<br /><br />Obviously it's not for everyone, but if you're a Gen Xer who has stayed up all night playing Bowie tracks for friends you now haven't seen in years, you'll find yourself in it.

B008K8U13K|5.0|Plays great on kindle fire. Was going to get sonic Cd for 5 bucks but opted for this and I'm very glad I did. Graphics look amazing you have to get used to controls but that shouldn't take to long. Long time sonic fan, may still get sonic Cd but low app storage on kindle fire.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|I've read the negative reviews and thought 'really?' This is a great summer series and exactly what I expected it to be- a teenage soap opera with the supernatural overlaid on it.  The werewolves are fun though I would like to know if they can change to full wolf form.  I love the writers decided to use la crosse instead of football for the main high school sport.The characters are fun and, as the season progressed, moved beyond their stereotypes into real characters.  The bad guy's backgtround is not typical and, in fact, in most shows he'd be the hero or at least the anti-hero. Instead here he is unredeemedly evil. Plus the characters run into some real problems and not just the usual teen angst (though there is a fair share of that-unavoidable for a show about teens). I recommend this series for anyone who wants to spend some time watching a series which is fun without being heavy or too dramatic. A great way to pass an evening.
B0088TG252|5.0|I put a lot of trust in ordinary Amazon reviewers.  So when I read the reviews about Safe House I was not expecting too much, just standard Denzel which is of course better than most.  So I was stunned at how good the movie is.  Denzel delivers a subtle and layered portrayal of the man who has seen it all done it all and has always thought things through more than you.  Yes there is a lot of action.  There is also plenty of character development.  A couple of characters change completely.  There are key moments between Denzel and Ryan Reynolds that are brilliant and this is the best performance I've ever seen Reynolds give.  Good movie.  4 1/2 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A lot of fun when you're not paying for it, but it does have a lot of ads when you have Internet connection.

B00846REIS|3.0|I read and loved the Fifty Shades of Grey series. I read all three in about a week. Then I saw that this book was comparable, but I was hesitant to read it because I read a LOT of reviews that say it basically copies the Fifty Shades trilogy. I downloaded the free sample onto my Kindle, which was the first chapter and about half of the 2nd chapter. After reading that, I decided to buy the whole book.<br /><br />To me, it wasn't as good as Fifty Shades of Grey. I still swooned WAY more for Christian than I do for Gideon in this book, but I am not totally going to knock it. Yes, it is unfortunately true that there are a LOT of similarities between this book and the Fifty Shades series (character names, some events, character personalities). I mean, c'mon, even the covers are very similar. I have to say I almost like the heroine in Bared to You a little more than Ana in Fifty Shades, but I am still up in the air on that one. But this wasn't an awful read, and I think that since it has been 3 months since I read Fifty Shades, I was able to just take this book for what it was and tried not to just compare it to Fifty Shades the whole time I was reading it. It was entertaining, and I'm not a book snob. I still read this book in like, 2 days, and I look forward to reading the next one in the series (Reflected in You).<br /><br />I will say that Sylvia Day is a lot less repetitive than E.L. James is with her vocabulary and there's no nickname given for the girl's stupid sex drive or whatever (\\"Inner Goddess\\"). I'd say I would still recommend this book for those who liked Fifty Shades, but put some space between reading Fifty Shades and reading this or you'll probably just be pissed off because of how similar they are.
B002BWP49C|5.0|In the first place, this item was well packaged.  It arrived on time and was in great condition.<br /><br />As far as the item itself is concerned, I love it!  I made the mistake of reading the first book since one of my vices is vampire lore.  The books were so well written, that I ended up viewing and later purchasing the DVDs in relation to each one.  However, the books are still better because they provide a much richer story.
B006P4FBUE|2.0|When I purchesed M.P.(mini piano) I was hoping for something good, but I found it fell low under my expectations.Here are some of the most annoying flaws:<br /><br />  -you can only use TWO fingers (all piano apps have this flaw) so most songs are out of the question.<br />  -its late.<br />  -the sound quality isn't the best.<br />  - it was 99&cent;.<br />  This app wasn't very good plus I had to pay for it.I would recommend downloading a FREE piano app because there isn't much difference (some of the free ones might be better)<br />  Overall:<br />  This app isn't worth your money and you'd be better off buying a free piano app.<br />  Rating: Two Stars, I didn't like it.

0805095535|5.0|Auster,  at sixty four, writes this second person narrative journal \\"in the winter\\" of his life. Undressing himself, he fills it with touching and painful reminiscences of his life; the death of his parents, the addresses he has lived at in New York,  Brooklyn, Paris and California, descriptions of his family, times with lovers and friends and his wife. Humane, touched with melancholy and wit, never dry or sentimental, there is brilliant writing here. He quotes Joseph Joubert, the French essayist (who he has translated for a book published by the New York Review of Books), \\"the end of life is bitter . . .  one must die lovable (if one can).\\" Wise words in 18th century France and today. A book to be read and re-read as one gets older.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This is a classic.  Everyone should watch this movie at least once, and pay special attention to all the real life clips Forrest is shown in!  Tom Hanks is great.
0385344228|4.0|Upon reflection there are some gaps in the story but overall it is a page turner.  I'm not usually a fan of legal thrillers but this is a book you will sit down with and not get up until it is finished.  The story has a gripping premise - did the son commit the murder - and takes place in a legal setting, without having the Rosato and Associates or Grisham  too detailed, \\"I'm smarter than you\\" feel about it.  The legal context actually provides a good thread that takes you between the subplots and brings you to the unexpcted conclusion.  You feel part of the family as they traverse through the harrowing legal drama and the later fall out.  A great beach or rainy Saturday read.

1439170916|5.0|Id been looking for a good read all summer and had tired of lame thrillers and boring mysteries, so I thought I'd return to the tried and true nonfiction.

0345803485|4.0|FSOG was better than expected. I feel this first book would've been more satisfying with a solid ending, but oh well that's big business for ya'.<br /><br />The author really nails her two main characters especially Ana who we feel we know so well just a little ways into the story. She's a fully realized likeable 21yr old who has finally fell in love for the first time and the guy is not a your typical \\"type A\\" guy (to say the least). I think from a male point of view it's kind of fascinating to wonder how it might be, to be a young billionaire and charm the pants off any girl you meet and like.<br /><br />Maybe it's not great literature, but the author did a great job of keeping this reader's attention throughout. Becca Battoe is fantastic as the audiobook reader! Great job casting her!
B006OFN0SE|4.0|An ambitious attempt to understand a complex man. . .<br /><br />I find the movie a bit slow, and I find the homosexuality theme unpleasant and possibly irrelevant to the choices made by Hoover as the founder and leader of the FBI. It seems that today homosexuality is blamed (or praised) or just detected every where and for everything.<br /><br />Still, i have to honor the attempt of Eastwood to do a serious analysis of a complex man, so i give the movie the benefit of my doubts.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I originally purchased the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy just to shock my daughter;however, by the time I finished the third book, I was<br />completely captivated by by the author's excellent characterization and plot development.  The two major characters evolve during this<br />trilogy as does their relationship.  The minor characters are also well developed. The plot is skillfully developed and provides the reader<br /> with complex conflicts and suspense.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I found the writing very childish and boring.  It was very repetitive and every other paragraph she would have to say \\"oh my!!\\"<br /><br />I think it was a waste of money and I should have just borrowed it from a friend, as that is the only reason anyone should read it, so you can bitch about how crap it is to your friends!!!<br /><br />Hope this helps others with their decision!! :-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The trilogy of books is captivating.  These books tug at a part of a woman that she might not talk about or even realize, but some how it says it perfectly.  The love story can be twisted in so many good ways, but then again what love story isn't?  I am a huge fan despite being a strong and confident woman.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|BAD. Really, really bad. One of the worst scripts I have ever seen on film.<br /><br />Alien is a masterpiece. Aliens is a great action sequel with its own take on the material. Alien 3 is a dark story, and does try to do something original,(the extended version does improve the story and helps to address some of the flaws). Alien Resurrection was an okay film that at least made sense.<br /><br />Prometheus makes absolutely no sense. The scrip is simply TERRIBLE. The story breaks Alien lore completely. The characters are boring, clueless, morons. Just incredibly bad.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a made for TV \\"Alien\\" spin-off, cash-cow. It is simply the worst Alien movie ever made, and possible one of THE worst movies of all time. It is a tragedy this movie exists, and is a totally wasted opportunity.<br /><br />Mr Scott, you should be ashamed. Allen Smithee wouldn't put his name on this garbage.

B007NZDES0|5.0|The last time I watched a Sade concert was in 1985, taped from a TV broadcast.<br /><br />With Bring Me Home, I was floored from beginning till the end. Sade has upped the ante and it shows. The stage set is simple and yet absolutely stunning. There are moments where the stage is covered with a translucent curtain affording a mysterious peek a boo game with the audience. In one number, a pillar rises from the stage with Sade on it. Breathtaking. Sade also dances  in this show, a surprise for me, considering the laid back tempo of her music.<br /><br />Sade still wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail. She looks amazing, like she hasn't aged a bit.<br /><br />For the set, Sade performs 22 of their best known hits and some material from Soldier Of Love. From the 80s (Your Love Is King, The Sweetest Taboo) to 90s (Kiss Of Life, No Ordinary Love), 00s (By Your Side, King Of Sorrow) and post 00s (Soldier Of Love, Skin)<br /><br />Bring Me Home is an absolute scorcher and is everything a concert should be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever because it has all other kind of games in the game
0307744434|5.0|I LOVE this book....I don't know how to put it any other way.  One of the best I have read this year and probably many others...and I've been reading everything I can get my hands on since I was 4 or 5.<br /><br />I am not going to give a review of the plot of this book or an analysis of the characters.  Many other reviewers have already done that and probably done it better than I could.<br /><br />All I can say is I did not want this book to end.  This book is pure enchantment and I could barely put it down to complete such mundane tasks as eating and sleeping. I was transported into the Night Circus and I didn't want to leave...and still don't.  If you even believe in magic the tiniest bit, that's a great reason to read this book...and if you don't, read it anyway...you may end up believing.  I have spent a couple of days wandering through one of the most amazing landscapes ever put in print...and like some other reviewers I can smell the caramel apples mixed with the smoke from the bonfire.<br /><br />From now on, I will be looking for the black and white tents everywhere I go, and who knows, maybe one of these days I will see the sign \\"Opens at Nightfall\\".  I wonder how many other reviewers will also be looking?<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK...IT'S MAGIC!!!

I am looking right now for something to grab my attention, but so far, Nothing. I am waiting to see if E.L James writes more on fifty, because I want to read more. I could not put this one down and was actually upset that I finished it because I wanted to keep reading it. All in all a FANTASTIC Trilogy, and definetly want more :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This was a lifesaver!  I had just begun a college English class and had not yet received the text from Amazon.  Being able to download the book via my smart phone using Kindle for Android was very helpful.

0441020712|4.0|After having been disappointed with Terminal World, I was worried Reynolds had lost his touch, but this book is a return to form. Unlike a lot of his books, it is less of a \\"whodunnit\\" and more of a treasure hunt, which he pulled off very well and just as suspensefully. Yes, some of the characters were a little annoying at times, but I think that was deliberate; the book is partly about them maturing, and by extension humanity. I found the treasure hunt to be very plausible given the personality of the person behind it, and in fact the characters do miss one of the clues. It was not a perfect book by any means though--a bit rough around the edges, as if it needed more editing. I would probably rank it as his third- or fourth-best novel. I am very excited to read the rest of the trilogy.
B0058GYP5W|3.0|This is a real soundtrack, and by that I mean it consists of more sounds than songs. There are a few songs that are pretty good, but some of them are too brief so they never really materialize. After a few minutes they just fade back into sounds.<br /><br />As a fan of The Chemical Brothers I thought that a whole soundtrack of their music had to be worth getting, but after hearing it I have mixed feelings about it. If there were a bunch of complete SONGS on the soundtrack it would definitely be worth it. This music may fit the movie well (I haven't seen it), but there are several tracks that consist of a very basic electronic sound/noise that continues for 20 or 30 seconds, and then comes the next track. You can hardly call them songs. On several of the tracks it sounds like The Chemical Brothers were experimenting with something that might be included in future songs, but they never completed them. If you like what you heard in the movie, but haven't heard The Chemical Brothers before, then I suggest you buy one of their albums. I doubt you will be disappointed. If you buy this soundtrack I think that you might. It boggles my mind that this soundtrack got 4, and especially 5 star reviews. I suspect these reviewers don't have any albums by The Chemical Brothers, so they have nothing to compare it to. There are always some people who don't like a particular album and rate it very low, but all of The Chemical Brothers albums, in my opinion, are at least good, if not very good to great. So a few one or two star reviews is to be expected. Again, there is some good stuff on here, and it sounds a little different (heavier) than a typical album of theirs, but there just aren't enough full-length songs for my taste.<br /><br />If you like this you will probably also like The Crystal Method. This soundtrack reminds me of some of their songs on the London soundtrack.
1449389627|5.0|I got an opportunity to read the book 'The Myths of Innovation' from the O'reilly's blogger review program.<br /><br />The book tried to answer the question, Why work hard.<br />It says that you may not be recognized as the innovator or brilliant mind in your time but there are chances that you will be recognized and the product you are working on will become the innovation of the decade.<br /><br />This book has many similarity to book written by Malcom Gladwell, The Outliers.  The book has many references to the Outliers book and also quotes the 10,000 hours theory in the later chapters.  As I have already read the book Outliers the subject which was handled by this book was not new and was more interesting for me as an after thought for Outliers, like what happens due to the innovations put forward by the outliers.  Just like the premise of the book Outliers, this book also suggests that the innovations were not just because of unique geniuses but they were backed by the environment they were developed in<br /><br />This book takes a practical approach to learn the history of innovation from some examples and clearly mentions that:<br />Quote from p40, \\"The majority of innovations come from dedicated people in a field working hard to solve a well-defined problem. It's not sexy, and it won't be in any major motion pictures anytime soon, but it's the truth.\\"<br /><br />Scott motivates the reader to learn the history of innovation and to learn how to start in the mystic world of innovation rightly pointing the fact that, quote, p54, \\"Einstein's E=mc2, Galileo's sun-centered solar system, and Darwin's theory of evolution were laughed at for years by experts around the world.\\" p58, \\"Experienced innovators anticipate these criticisms.\\"<br /><br />On p59, Scott says, \\"Many innovators give up when they learn ideas--even with dazzling prototypes or plans in hand--are only the beginning.\\" which I felt is not logical because if someone gave up on idea no one knew that there was an innovation in making and hence there is no way of knowing this to write this sentence.  This sentence shall be mentioned as an assumption.<br /><br />I was not aware of so many dimensions of the theory of innovation.  This book takes a multidimensional approach to explore the world of innovations.  On p61, it says \\"innovative ideas are rarely rejected on their merits; they're rejected because of how they make people feel. If you forget people's concerns and feelings when you present an innovation, or neglect to understand their perspectives in your design, you're setting yourself up to fail.\\"<br /><br />Page 61, mentions the \\"Innovator's dilemma\\" which is interestingly explained with example of Alexander Graham Bell and Western Union.  The book has many references to other books which makes the reader create a list of all books to read or explore after this book.  The apt mentions of web page and reference links is also a good resource for further reading.<br /><br />The book mentions some successful companies repeatedly like p62, \\"Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, HP, and Yahoo! started as small groups who dismissed the well-worn path of convincing others and chose instead to realize ideas on their own. These start-up ventures were born out of the frustration of failing to make innovation happen in larger, established businesses.

B00004ST9Q|5.0|This is a great music and video compilation of Whitney's music from the beginning to the early 2000's when The Greatest Hits came out. I love putting it on and especially watching her video's from the 80's, it really brings me back. Any Whitney fan would be happy with this dvd video collection.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Not going to write a long review. Out boredom rented it here at Amazon. Loved it. One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time.<br />Check it out for yourself. I think you may like it.
0307592731|4.0|This is a good read that is well written.  The author did not have very much knowledge on flora and fauna or ecology.  She made almost every mistake as a beginner backpacker and hiked almost the whole way with bad shoes.  If she had Hi Tech shoes that were worn in she could have alleviated most of the pain and challenge and had more opportunity to discover nature with a few guide books.  I think that she needed to create suffering with her feet to match the emotional growth of losing her mother and just maturing.  A stadium horn would have provided more safety from bears and mountain lions.[[ASIN:0307592731 Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (Oprah's Book Club 2.0)]]

B002436WFI|4.0|Bethan (Laura Haddock) has a look of shock.<br />Rincewind \\"I beg your pardon!\\"<br /><br />This is a tongue in cheek (2008 TV movie) based on the writings of Terry Pratchett novels \\"The Colour of Magic\\" & \\"The Light Fantastic\\". I have not read the novels so I cannot compare this presentation to them. As soon as I saw that the bad guy Trymon was Tim Curry I knew I was in for a treat. Brian Cox the Narrator really sets the pace for this presentation.<br /><br />Most of the story seems to be focused on the adventures of an expelled wizard student Rincewind (David Jason) and a tourist Twoflower (Sean Astin.) In a mythical flat world held up by elephants standing on a turtle's back.<br /><br />\\"You really have not been anywhere until you've got back home\\" the tourist.

B005LAII3U|4.0|When I found out that a \\"remake/reboot\\" was in production, I was pissed. Colin Farrell? And why would they ruin the cult classic that starred Arnold? There are plenty of Philip K.Dick's stories that have not been put to film, (Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Paycheck, Screamers and the impossible to watch \\"Next\\" (Nicholas Cage) based on \\"The Golden Man\\", have been done) that every fan would like to see something else besides another \\"Total Recall\\"(based on Dick's short story, \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\") film. BUT...<br />It did not disappoint. Len Wiseman directed a good popcorn flick here, paying special attention to great chases and amazing effects in a \\"Blade Runner\\" (based on Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\\") type future. The cast did a nice job, Farrell (Minority Report) played a good Quaid, and Beckinsale (Underworld) plays the crazed wife particularly well as Lori. Wish there was more of Bryan Cranston (who plays Cohagen.)<br /><br />There are a few great things in this movie, especially for those interested in DOP (Director of Photography.) The wide shot from left to right as Lori and Cole race along the rooftops, the mirrored elevator scene was well done. Cool weapons and technology; in fashion is the implanted hand phone, face holograms, and the awesome bullet cameras.<br />I thought the idea of the elevator \\"The Fall\\" was a pretty cool idea, an immense shaft that travels through the earth and the anti-gravity scenes were nifty and well done.<br /><br />As a fan of sci-fi genre and Philip K.Dick (author) It's nice to see his works on the screen. Yet, like I said, this is the second Recall film, PKD fans want \\"Ubik\\", \\"Man In The High Castle\\" and \\"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I was skeptical and came out impressed.

0545425115|4.0|About:<br />In The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins has created a gritty dystopian world that is ruled by the Capital of Panem.<br />The Capital is surrounded by twelve districts and most people are starving to death.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a televised fight to the death that takes place each year. During an event called 'The Reaping', one boy and one girl from each district are chosen for the games. There are twenty four 'tributes' total that will compete in the Hunger Games.<br />Talk about reality tv in the extreme!<br /><br />Our protagonist, young Katniss Everdeen, hunts with her bow and arrow to feed her family. Her father died in a mine blast. Katniss Everdeen's best friend and hunting partner is a boy named Dale.<br />Now that The Reaping is coming around again, her twelve year old sister, Prim, is old enough to have her name put in. To Katnisses horror, Prim is the first name drawn from Disctrict 12. Katniss volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen from Katnisses district is the baker's son, Peeta Mellark. As Katniss participates in the Hunger Games, she finds unexpected friends and even a love interest.<br />At first she thought she had no chance of winning, but as the games progress her survival instincts kick in.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />When I first began reading The Hunger Games I had no idea I would be sucked into this gritty dystopian world.<br />I must say, I found the first sixty pages or so to be slow going. However, once the games began I could not put the book down, especially the last hundred pages or so.<br />Author Suzanne Collins writes multi dimensional characters and an action packed storyline. Those Hunger Games are tough! The final battle scene turned my stomach.<br /><br />I really enjoy dystopian fiction, I like these gritty, desperate types of stories. The Capital is harsh and cruel, using these kids fight to the death as entertainment and as a reminder of the power they hold over everyone. There's plenty of mind games and manipulation involved here.<br />I liked Katniss from the start, for being just sixteen, she holds her own and survives as best she can. She takes care of her mom and sister after her father dies and her mom goes into a deep depression. Katniss resents her mom for this. Once she is in the arena, she really thinks things through as she plays the game.<br />I liked Peeta as well. As the book progresses, his character is really sweet.<br />Then of course, there is Gale, Katnisses best friend back home. We don't get to see much from Dale in this book, but I have a feeling a love triangle is just getting started.<br />The cast of supporting characters is well written as well and the world building was great, so as the story progressed, I was easily swept up.ind games and manipulation involved here.<br />I liked Katniss from the start, for being just sixteen, she holds her own and survives as best she can.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time it my favorite out of all my games so just love it
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Injoyed playing all of the games some were easy and many more challenging. I am now on my second go round and am enjoying it just as much.
B0089LT8Y6|3.0|I have every testament album and this is the first time that I have been let down. The lyrics are really bad. musicianship is good, but seems uninspired. I would buy it because I love Testament, not because its great. There are really no fast songs, like More Than Meets The Eye. Too bad, it has a great cover, just a mediocre sound and lyrics ruin it. Native blood is really bad. Maybe next time.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|Would not recommend this series.  How this guy got 5 books out of this is beyond me.  The only reason I kept going was because I had finished 2 of the books and figured the ending had to bring it all together.  Nope.  Just another murder and a dangling end.  Just lots of war, suffering, burning, greed, heads on spikes.  I skipped book 4 and never felt like I missed a thing.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have had this watch for about a year and wear it everyday.  I love that it is self winding and doesn't require a battery.  Mine has held up great.  There are just two things about mine that people should know about.  Every month or so it does have a tendency to run a few minutes fast.  And it also frays a bit on the end of the strap but it really isn't a big deal.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|has a lot of variety. I have a lot of fun playing all of these games. recommend for everybody over 7
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app, a friend of mine got me into it and I wasn't sure about it at first. what's really good about it is that its not always an easy game. the first stage is kind of a ' get to know it ' type of thing. I have gotten to dj box :) and I love the game and cant wait to get expirements. ;)

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Loved the trilogy, very well written with many layers lending to a realistic feel.  Full of suspense and surprises.  You really get into the characters as the books progress.
0345803485|1.0|Besides the characters being completely one-demensional and unbelievable (a 22 year old who's in college and never been drunk or masturbated, really?), this has to be the poorest writing I've ever seen. Every time I became interested in the story at all, I was immediately distracted by the annoying, repetitive interjections by the storyteller. No one cares about your \\"inner goddess\\". What does that even mean?<br />There are way better things to read if you just want to knock out a quick one-handed DJ set, ladies. Don't bother with this book; not worth all the hype.
B000069HZP|5.0|FANTASTIC movie.  This is quite possibly the most engrossing movie--full of twists and turns.<br /><br />The life of wealthy businessman Nicholas Van Orton (played by Michael Douglas) gets turned upside down when Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) is hired by his brother (played by Sean Penn)as a birthday present.  There are so many outstanding parts that the hardest thing is trying to decide which is my favorite.<br /><br />If you have never seen it, buy it!  If you have already seen it, you know exactly why i gave it 5 stars.

0393338398|5.0|Moneyball changed the way I looked at baseball.<br /><br />The book is absolutely fascinating in it's account of the role that General Managers have in baseball. Believe it or not, those guys are underpaid compared to the players.<br /><br />What Moneyball does so well is that to understand baseball, you need to look at the totality of the season and not a single game. You need to trust statistics more than your own instinct if you want to succeed in the long term. RBIs and stolen bases are overrated. Long live the On Base Percentage!<br /><br />I'm not a big baseball fan anymore, but it was hard for me to put this book down. You can't help but root for the Oakland A's and their progressive experiments (which have now overtaken Major League Baseball).<br /><br />The crazy thing about this book, is it makes you question other things in your life not connected to baseball. It's hard to explain, but multiple times I've stopped and thought about whether I was seeing something objectively and not looking at the greater picture of a particular instance.<br /><br />Well, anyway, if you have a passing interest in baseball pick this up. Just try not to be closed minded.

B004BCENB0|5.0|This Seller has described this LP very well.  The cover doesn't have the fold outs, but is in like new condition. The LP looks and plays as if its never been played before. My original copy went missing in the mid '80s. and now I am so very happy I have it back again.  Thanks for selling this to me.  The music is amazing and this plays like its never been played. I repeated myself, and what I said is true. I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again.  Thanks very much.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|As a string player, I did enjoy the music in this collection though it is \\"piano heavy.\\"  Pianists should really enjoy the sheet music for this soundtrack. Marianelli wrote some beautiful pieces.<br /><br />I only wish that the liner notes would have given proper credit to the three English country dance tunes in the collection.  I did a lot of extensive research to locate the original titles and composer.  These were orchestrated by Dario Marianelli for the film, but all were originally written in the late 1600's by Henry Purcell.  Here are the original tune titles:<br /><br />#4 Meryton Town Hall - \\"Tythe Pig\\"<br />#8 A Postcard to Henry Purcell - \\"Moniek's Maggot\\", also known as \\"Rondeau\\" from Abdelazer Suite<br />#11 Another Dance - \\"Kit Kat Club\\"
B000QX9RCS|5.0|I want to first say, that this Seller is amazing.  I got it yesterday along with a couple of other vinyls that I ordered at the same time. She also put in an other LP that I didn't order!!! Wow, what a Great Surprise!!!!  Thanks so very much.  That was Amazing!!! Now, let me give you the review of the LP.  The cover is in surprising very good considering it was produced in 1972.  It has, as she described, self ware around the edges.  The LP plays really good and I loved it just as I did when it first came out.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again. Thanks dear seller.  Great Job!!!

B004ZEWP28|4.0|Maybe I'm nostalgic but Play and 18 were almost perfect. However this album does have it's moments. Moby albums just seem to grow on me and I definitely don't regret buying this album. Lacrimae is one example ... it's worth the price of the album alone.

B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I honestly had no clue what The Lorax was before we watched the movie.  I knew it had something to do with trees and since it was a Dr. Seuss tale I knew it would be a good story.  The movie blew me and my family away.  The animation is truly amazing and we have watched this DVD more than I'd like to admit in the two weeks that we've had it!  You can see the everything so clearly and I can't imagine how the animators even captured all those details.  The voices made my husband and I laugh as they are from popular actors/actresses including Taylor Swift, Zac Efron, Danny Devito and Betty White.<br /><br />The story is actually quite moving too and was perfect for me to introduce some lessons to my children.  \\"The Lorax\\" is a tale of a young man, the Once-ler, who goes off on his in search for the perfect material to make his Thneed (a crazy sweater.)  He meets the Lorax when he cuts down a tree and the Lorax explains how he speaks for the trees and takes care of the animals.  The story goes on of course as he cuts down more trees until there is none left.  As a side story there is a town in the future where there are no trees but one girl (Taylor Swift) wants one.  They actually sell bottled air since the air and pollution is so bad!<br /><br />So anyways a young boy (Zac Efron) goes on a mission and hears the story from the Once-ler.  Can he grow a tree and save the town?<br /><br />The story is great to teach kids about caring about the environment, recycling, and how one person can make a difference!<br /><br />This is a must-see movie in my book, even if you don't have kids!  Truly amazing animation, hilarious songs and dancing and a great overall story.
1469984202|4.0|While not as strong on character development as I usually prefer in my reading, the premise of this story grabbed me immediately, and when it was over, I wanted more. Good science-fiction has always carried a political message and this one is no different; however, the author managed to prevent the politics from taking over the story. I wanted more...imagine my joy at having just discovered Book 6! Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's back to the silos I go!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great app to play while on a road trip. However, it started acting laggy after a while. Very entertaining.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the only problem is that it takes to long to get money and investment points. Other than that great game! :-D
0316098329|4.0|My title should read \\"Grabs you after the 1st 20 pages or so, and then won't let go\\". I almost stopped reading after the 1st couple of pages because the author seems to drop the reader into the middle of the story and it takes a bit to get your bearings. But once it starts to dawn on you what is going on, it is really difficult to put down. This is a one day read.<br /><br />There are some spoilers below******<br /><br />There are some aspects of the book that readers that gave the book a low rating were right about, in my opinion. I guess the difference is that I saw them as adding to the whole story, not taking away. For instance, the poor grammar that Jack uses. At times it is difficult to read, but I felt that it might very well be how a child that has had no interaction with anyone other than his mother just might speak. He has an enormous vocabulary, because Ma focuses on teaching him words and meanings. Whereas she may not have emphasized other aspects of his education. Makes sense to me. I think of how tiring it can be sometimes to teach and explain every little thing to my kids, particularly when they are being especially inquisitive. Imagine not only being the only parent, but the only person!<br /><br />I gave it only 4 instead of 5 stars because of the beginning and because I doubted the escape. Really? A man that has gone to such lengths to conceal you as to put chain link fence under the shed is really going to take her at her word that Jack is dead? Just because she tells him not to look?<br /><br />I also found it hard to believe that she would attempt suicide, leaving Jack without her. Although, who could say what one might do in the situation.<br /><br />All in all, this was a good book with much to think about.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|I was a huge Crow fan when the film came out.  I'd already read the graphic novel (comics) and was very pleased with the way the film presented the story.  My ex-wife and I got married on Oct. 31st; if that gives you an idea.  The Draven character in the film was much nicer than the Draven portrayed by Jason Lee, but that was a given since graphic novels are often more gritty than their film counterparts (and have to be to do well at the box office).<br /><br />This two disc version rocks!  I got it to replace my well-worn, quickly obsolete VHS version (which includes the last on-camera interview with Brandon Lee).<br /><br />And, yes; this is a 2 disc version.  I was surprised when I opened it.<br /><br />Disc one has the film in widescreen ratio.  Nice.<br /><br />Disc two has a bunch of great additions.  The \\"making of\\" featurette includes most (if not all) of Brandon's last on-camera interview.  Since his death, it has always been amazing to me that he was mentally \\"in-the-role\\" as a character who had returned from the dead.  His reference to how we all take life for granted is absolutely chilling, but it also makes me hope I have that same focus when I move on.<br /><br />The interview with The Crow creator, James O'Barr, caught me totally off guard.  While I thought the comic was great, I had no idea about the story's history.  An orphan who isn't even certain of his birthdate, was forbidden to draw in his home by his adoptive parents, and the beautiful love of his life who was killed by a drunk driver.  I had no idea that this was the motovation of (possibly) the best vendetta story of our century (note: C.B. in Death Wish is officially a classic!).<br /><br />The deleted scenes on disc two are definately worth a watch for any fan. I'm guessing they cut them do to the graphic violence, but the arcade game addition sure solidifies some key points in the story: T-Bird's gang are still murderers, and Eric D. (Crow) now knows it.<br /><br />That's my take.  I'm glad I bought this version.
B001ZVJ1SA|5.0|I read this book more than once and I loaned it to someone n kant remember who so I'm lookin for a new one.

B000FCK65W|5.0|This story of an early 20th century working class family in Williamsburg, Brooklyn presents characters who are loving despite their faults.  Every character is complex, and the writing is very engaging.  A real treat to read.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|W.E is an art film, in its essence. The style is, to me, more of French Cinema than perhaps a US film release, but comparisons such as this are for naught and are more suited to Siskel and Ebert styled reviews.<br /><br />The fact that Madonna co-wrote and directed this film creates a weighted bias, and though I won't directly commit here to my thoughts on this, prior to viewing the movie, suffice to say I was quite surprised to see that Madonna has shown great depth as a director and has challenged her viewers.<br /><br />This being said, I do think there is, again a bias as to what viewers are willing to accept as directorial genius when the director is not a \\"whomever\\". Even more so when a pop star with limited to no directorial experience has accomplished this. I think we've all seen movies wrought of \\"the geniuses\\" that have left us possibly shaking our heads at what the PR hype told us it would be, but such is one's individual take, or not.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are magnificent. The score is beautiful and is presented in a more classic fashion, not resorting to the current trend of, say, overblown choirs stacked on top of big orchestration. Further, the score by Abel Korseniowski is often subtle and far reaching in heightening the film. It reinforces, yet again, for me, that obscure European film composers are far more reaching than what is produced for the majority of the US film industry (such as Wojciech Kilar's ( a student of Nadia Boulanger, hence the greatness) sumptuous understated scoring of Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\").  W.E is further juxtaposed by use of Pop material (as is so in vogue now to do). Hence a lengthy and varied set of song credits do accrue.<br /><br />The movie is a dualism that compares the maelstrom of King Edward abdicating his throne because he is in love with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, who all of England, it seems, will not accept as a suited wife to the Crown.<br /><br />The companion contemporary story deals with a young woman, Wally Winthrop (her mother  had named her after Wallis-Simpson), in an unhappy marriage and her gradual and ongoing psychological breakdown due to her loss of identity within a marriage which has denigrated to her being, essentially a de-valued trophy wife to a successful, but philandering and abusive husband. Her coping mechanism has been to escape into her inner world, which centers around her fixation of her namesake, Wallis-Simpson, brought finally to fruition in her daily visits to Sotheby's to view and personally interact with a collection of personal items of Edward and Wallis-Simpson to be auctioned.<br /><br />It is a bit confusing, initially when periods change abruptly in the film, following the comparative presented, often done through use of touchstones, either tangible (as in the museum) or inner escapism fantasies of Wally. However, it is certainly no more far reaching as a transitional concept as was often a confusing Blockbuster, \\"Inception\\". However, \\"Inception\\" boasts a director, with let's say, an accepted reputation, where \\"W.E\\" has Madonna. My feeling is that Madonna accomplished many things very well in this film, but quite possibly her adventurous creative approach will be un-accepted by many simply because she is Madonna.<br /><br />The movie is worth your time in watching, most certainly. It was filmed on a modest budget by Hollywood standards, and did not re-coup its expenses at the box office, but DVD's live on as a second and longer chance for films like this to be understood and gain audience.<br /><br />The cast is great! Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy shine as Wallis and Edward. Abbie Cornish is wonderful as Wally.<br /><br />It is well worth mentioning that Katie McGrath (who broke in first in a secondary role on \\"The Tudors\\" and was launched as \\"Morgana\\" in the BBC's \\"Merlin\\") as \\"Lady Thelma\\" here is an actress to keep watch on, as Katie is captivating on screen even in brief supporting. Great things lie ahead for Katie McGrath.<br /><br />As a postscript, I have purposely avoided documenting specific content of the movie because I don't care for reviews which give too much of the movie away, so I would rather present less, than more in this regard.<br /><br />W.E is well worth your time, and congratulations to Madonna for her success, irregardless of box office, as a director of surprising substance.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|Bought this to increase the grandkids blu-ray selection. Good value with the standard DVD and digital copy. It's good entertainment for the 2 to 4 year-old crowd.

B00003CXBK|4.0|I used to really like this movie. I remember it as being a metaphor for how human beings have destroyed the environment and polluted it, instead of living in harmony with nature. But now that I watch it over, it seems Prince Ashitaka's only real concern is for San. His unwillingness to pick a side irritates me.<br /><br />Anyways, creative movie, interesting. More spiritual and different than western animations. I recommend watching. Also, the best part of the film was the deer god/night walker - he is so cool!
B007SGM084|5.0|I really loved this book.  The first book is really about \\" hard limits\\"  I would recommend that you keep an open mind and finish it. The next two book are really hard to put down.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is the sequel to The Hunger Games, and I just decided to reread it as well as The Hunger Games, which I reread earlier this summer. In the second book in the series, Katniss and Peeta have (obviously) survived, but her stunt with the berries has caused dissention among the districts, which could turn into full-blown rebellion. And the Capitol is angry. Really angry. And the Quarter Quell is coming up. WARNING, SPOILERS. The Quarter Quell occurs every twenty-five years, and there is a special cruel twist to the games. In the 50th one (the one that Haymitch won), there were twice as many tributes. And now, in the 75th, people who are already victors must go back in. In other words, Katniss (and Peeta) have to return to the arena. But there is still the rebellion going on. I actually think that I like Catching Fire slightly more than The Hunger Games. This is probably because a lot of new characters are interested, like Finnick Odair, Wiress, Beetee, Johanna Mason, etc. etc. Also, it's the parts about the rebellion that I'm more interested in. Catching Fire is just as suspenseful too, and most of it takes place back in District 12, showing the changing dynamics between Katniss and the people around her. I'll probably be rereading Mockingjay too sometime soon. And by the way, I really hope that Suzanne Collins writes a book about Finnick & Annie.<br /><br />You can read all of my reviews at my blog, located at novareviews.blogspot.com.

0743454537|5.0|Anna Fitzgerald was conceived in a lab with the help of a geneticist to make sure she had the right genes and chromosome placement necessary to help her sister survive her battle with leukemia.  At the age of thirteen and after undergoing many, many medical procedures to help her sister, her parents want her to donate a kidney.  Anna doesn't want to part with a kidney and takes it upon herself to sue her parents for the right to make her own medical decisions.<br /><br />This one was a real emotional battle for me.  On the one hand, I can totally sympathize with the parents and their wanting to do absolutely anything to save their daughter's life, but on the other hand, I felt so sorry for Anna and the way she was used.  She didn't get to have a normal childhood and was always in her sister's shadow.  I'm pretty sure that's what the author was going for though.  As for the ending, I'm still stunned.  I normally have at least an inkling of what's to come, but not this time.  It hit me like an emotional ton of bricks.  Wow!
B0036T31YY|5.0|Spoiler Alert.  Don't read this if you don't want to hear about the story plot.<br /><br />The main character is a single mother named Jes.  She has a short temper when it comes to her young son.  The movie doesn't show her physically hurting her son in any way but it does show her scolding him for leaving a toy out and spilling paint. But, by the end of the movie, you figure out that she must have killed him during an angry outburst.<br /><br />The death of her son, leaves Jes in a never-ending cycle of \\"purgatory\\" as she boards a sail boat thinking she can do something different that will change the outcome of what happened to her son.  Unfortuately for Jes, this doesn't happen because each time she boards the sailboat, the same events occur.

B007NUP6GS|5.0|What a joy is this new release of all six motets by Johan Sebastian Bach!  Many of us, fortunate enough to be in college glee clubs or choirs such as in the days of the brilliant choral conductor Howard Swan, have had the privilege of singing these exceptional masterpieces - works at times for double antiphonal choirs and at other times for one chorus in multiple parts.  Learning them is a challenge: remembering the experience of performing is a treasure.<br /><br />This set of performances were recorded during live performances in London, St John's Smith Square, 2011 with Sir John Eliot Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir: these were recorded at the end of a tour through The Netherlands, Germany, Italy and France so what we hear is an ensemble very comfortably at home in the creation of the little miracles of these six motets. John Eliot Gardiner's wonderfully measured and subtle approach to these miniature masterpieces emphasizes their dance-like joy, and his virtuosic choir responds with glowing warmth and clarity. The engineering is of the first order and that coupled with the choir's brilliant diction and vibrant tone makes the recording seem like a private concert!<br /><br />The motets are as follows:<br />Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden BWV 230<br />Komm, Jesu, komm BWV 229<br />Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf BWV<br />Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227<br />F&uuml;rchte dich nicht, ich bin bei dir BWV 228<br />Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied BWV 225<br /><br />Accompanying the recordings are 44 pages of notes in German, English and French by Gardiner that are illuminating. Grady  Harp, August 12
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Finally a movie kids could actually learn from. I gave this movie 5 stars for the meaning of the story, yet the actual entertainment part gets a maximum of 4 stars.<br />\\"Unless someone like we care, nothing will be done\\". So, I bought this movie and hoping more movies like this could be made to teach our children how to care. I guess I'm starting to get sick of movies about idolizing characters, things and stuff...and start appreciating what we take for granted. So, I say make more movies to teach our children values in life and a little less singing and dancing, please lol.<br />Conclusion, meaningful store, too much dancing...purchased with no regrets.

Enjoyed the presence of many of the people in the video.  Excellent job of capturing much of the flavor... if there had been smell-ivision and ganga, then the experience would have been 100%.  Oh for a Jamaican patty on the street in front of the studio.  These people were very nice to me, a young man from america.  40 years later, I am thankful for the experience.<br />One commenter said something about all reggae being the same, and to that I say, I feel sorry for you, reggae is a rainbow...  Ah, but are there colors to the color-blind?

1906355630|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2UE7RSBE1F85X]]SEARCHABLE... FINDABLE... DO-ABLE!<br />HOW TO HARNESS TWITTER TO ADVANCE YOUR LAW PRACTICE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This book is for two kinds of lawyers. Which one are you?  Do you love Twitter?  Or do you cordially detest it?  If you love it, you'll adore this book.  But if you don't, be warned; you may find yourself falling in love with this pesky, yet wildly popular social network anyway, whether you want to or not, finding yourself swept away by the tsunami of enthusiasm generated by the author, Adrian Dayton.<br /><br />As a US-based corporate lawyer and ex-missionary, would you believe, Dayton's expertise on Twitter is astounding and his missionary zeal really quite compelling, not to mention convincing.<br /><br />Not many lawyers are rainmakers, he observes.  Bringing in new business to your law practice requires a different skill set than penning brilliant opinions or nobly representing lost causes in court.  Nonetheless, as the author both states and implies, Twitter really can turn on the rain for you, provided you understand it, recognize its potential and work it to your advantage, which this book shows you how to do.<br /><br />A slim but substantial paperback published by the Ark group as part of their `Social Media for Lawyers' series, the book offers almost countless handy, helpful hints for harnessing the power of Twitter -- all in a friendly, colloquial, readable style, more typical of self-help tomes than most books on law, but all the better for that.<br /><br />Over its eighteen chapters, says the author, you'll learn how to do a number of things, including: engaging on Twitter `without looking like a rookie... creating a profile that will `hook clients in the blink of an eye'... contacting CEOs... bringing in clients... and generally making a name for yourself.<br /><br />Take for example, the chapter on `hashtag power' and (#) (those funny little noughts and crosses signs that look like a `sharp' in music, e.g. #obama). Under `professional use of hashtags' the author recalls searching for a likely publisher for one of his books, when someone posted a `Does anybody know a good contracts attorney?' message.<br /><br />Following a contact, an exchange of email addresses and a phone call, expert author found himself with a new corporate client for his firm.  Well, it doesn't happen all the time, we would add! But it's an example of the opportunities that can unexpectedly pop up online via this apparently simple-minded, but ingenious, versatile and searchable social medium, which now has an estimated 560 million users worldwide, compared with 10 million in 2009 when the first edition of the book was published.<br /><br />With that kind of growth record, Twitter has emerged as a serious marketing tool, among other things, which should be of interest to professionals in any field, particularly the law. If you're a lawyer in hot pursuit of more business, you'd do well to acquire this book, published as at April 2012 -- and also accessible as a PDF.e funny little noughts and crosses signs that look like a `sharp' in music, e.g. #obama).

B0053XM7ZU|4.0|This series is definitely addictive. There are perhaps too many characters to follow easily but the chapters are developed so you can skim the characters / themes that do not hold interest.  I am keen to keep reading!
B001EBWING|1.0|How on earth did this movie ever become such an icon?  It's a low-budget, grade B, black-and-white movie almost all of which is set in a bar.  It's even got a fake airplane.  The only thing it's got going for it is a couple of big name actors.  And they delivered routine performances.  What, pray tell, is exceptional about this film?  It's essentially a stage play and not a very good one at that.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not think it was possible for erotica to be so bad.  The book had so many sex scenes that it became boring. I flipped through the pages just to finish it and not feel that I wasted money buying this overrated, but cleverly marketed, pulp.  If you want a good dirty read, get a Jackie Collins book. At least her characters are interesting.
B002ZG981E|1.0|I found this movie a confused jumble.  It was one of those \\"huh?\\" movies.  It was often unclear who the good guys and bad guys were or what exactly was happening.  This was one of the rare sci-fi movies that we watched, then tossed.  The effects were very good, but I found this movie to be all effects with little substance.  That can be okay with even a predictable, rudimentary story, as long as the story is clear and can be followed.  Unfortunately, the elements of good storytelling were largely missing from this movie, and the effects, good as they were, couldn't carry it.  I'm a lifelong sci-fi can, and if you want real sci-fi, get Alien or Terminator and skip this one.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|This is an amazingly simple, yet engaging and challenging application.  I like the ease of game play and the addictive way that the game challenges players to try to solve the puzzles and to beat your previous score.  The background music is very calming.  I also like the feature that Ichi allows players to create their own puzzles.  The app is well worth the price.
0345803485|1.0|Why is this book on the best seller list.  This is nothing but trash, nothing like what the synopsis leads you to believe.  I would never have bought this if I knew how trashy it was.  I did the preview in kindle and nothing indicated that it was about bondage.  This is by far the worst book I ever read. I tried to bypass all the trashiness and this book offered nothing else. If you take out all the parts on bondage there really is no topic except for how a man took advantage of an innocent young woman.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|While George Martin creates an amazing world, he uses too much irrelevant dialogue and adds characters on every page. It's clever but 2/3 (or more) of these characters play absolutely no role in the plot. This does not compare well to Tolkien, nor to James Clavell whose characters come and go, but play an essential role in the story, whether long or short term. We have to wait several hundred pages to find out about our favorites, and in some cases, the setting is so hard to unravel as to make plot advancement difficult to understand. It seems that each chapter is a separate short story difficult to meld with the central plot.

B007XCH15K|5.0|Samantha's first hitless album (at least in the US) follows pretty much the same formula as her others. PWL hi-nrg productions, full force productions, some rocking girl pop, and some house music that hints more at the 90s sound than the 80s. If you like her other albums, you should like this one just as well. There are several curiosities as well. There's a medley of 70s disco tracks More More More and Love to Love You Baby. A cover of Kiss's Rock n Roll All Night. Samantha doing the track Walking On Broken Glass, which would be a hit for Annie Lennox.

B0066W1AZK|3.0|This is not a bad app.  It has a good AI and plats well.  I would like to see smother graphics and better sound.
0061703087|4.0|This novel is a little differently told. First of all it's in the first person perspective which is interesting but I got a feeling I was missing a lot of the story due to it being channeled primarily through one person. This character, Jack, seems to be a very reactive type of person, very pleasing to others. Especially his wife and children, I can understand being patient with the children but just reading all the family stuff of a stay at home Dad is very tedious and started to make me zone out at times. So it's a slower read than Crichtons typical whiz bang type of writing describing go-go uber-successful characters run amok that we've all seen in so many modern shows. I really wanted him to finally just have it out with his wife but it never really happens.<br /><br />As always the science and science fiction aspects of the book are fascinating. I'm reminded of an old college lit professor who described all this sort of stuff(nano-machine swarms) in class 15 years ago, he must have been reading Drexlers book. Namely nano-robots that are so sophisticated that they are for all intensive purposes alive. They are like bees, but invented by humans for primarily military use as a flying camera. It turns out that they get so evolved that they can infect people and they do just that here, controlling them etc.<br /><br />This all collides with Jack and his wife who works at this company Xymos with a manufacturing facility in the northern part of Nevada along the California border. I can't say I ended up caring about any of the characters here, it's mostly the fantastic science/fiction that is the main one. This is nothing new in Crichtons writing, the main character is always the science fiction and it's consequences; the human characters are just a bit player really. I guess the differentiating part here is the family aspect with young children, etc. Usually it's late 20's to early 30s ivy league selfish types and there's all sorts of sex, etc going on, not so here.<br /><br />Once you get into the story it becomes a page turner but it takes longer than typical Crichton fare since the early part of the book is how Jack is dealing with being a stay at home Dad and how his wife seems to disappear into her work and the resulting marital friction that comes along with all that. Couldn't have cared less about it, and they seemed to me to be a boring type of family.<br /><br />Once it's all over there are a few glaring holes though such as the aftermath of dead people and a blown up facility. Jack seems to just go on with barely a beat and there seems to be no description or newsflash about what happened afterwards. We are left with a whimper; Jack being ambiguously afraid of contamination or whatever is around the corner with what's left of Xymos, like it's not really over after all. So it's an unsatisfying ending really.<br /><br />Recommended as a day reader but like much of Crichtons stuff, other than the fascinating scifi, there's not much else that stands out.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was very interesting and was a new and different type of post-apocalyptic read. I really enjoyed it. Not just for teenagers.
1401937519|1.0|Before you buy this book or post a review please remember the most important facts about this case that so many people are all too willing to ignore. SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DIE! That seems like a prerequisite to having a &#34;Near Death Experience&#34;, which in most everyone's popular opinion means the person's heart stopped beating and they ceased breathing. This lady was only in a coma. Not to say that you can't have &#34;Out of Body&#34; experiences in a coma but she couldn't have ascended into 'heaven&#34;, or anywhere else for that matter, without having crossed over to the other side by actually dying.<br /><br />The second fact that is also overlooked is that she claims to have received a supernatural healing but she was receiving chemotherapy. Perhaps the chemotherapy healed her? DUH! C'mon people, use some discernment.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|great. app.  worth the money its not so hard you cant get through. but there are a few mini. games that challenge. grafics wonderful story moves nicely.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Addictive and challenging without being too hard to enjoy. I played all through &quot;where's my water?&quot; and was delighted to find another whole version of the game!
030758836X|5.0|Loved the writing about how young women put on a 'cool girl' persona to get a guy to like them.  Then what happens after this fades? The insights into the relationship decline between two real characters was magic.  The book takes a slightly unbelievable turn in the last third but the ending is great and real. I don't know why people complain about it.  This book is great.
B000IZA9PI|2.0|I love star trek and this movie lacks the excitement of the Star Trek franchise.  The movie itself is single-minded and the actors are showing their age.
0060245867|2.0|I have heard so many good things about these \\"If you give a ...\\" books. So I finally ordered two, the mouse and the dog book.<br />And I am quite disappointed. It does not rhyme, and to me it appears the animals are bossing around their little human friend.<br />My kids (2 and 4) did not like, and neither did we parents.<br />Sorry.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|I think these books are alittle overrated! It's an easy read and good for beach holiday but that's about it!

B007KOYEOC|1.0|What Rubbish!I'm amazed. This is droll boring and been done badly as this before.  I can't believe this rot is on the best seller list.  Well I'm amazed.
0345803485|5.0|Well people on here are saying they didnt like the book. But I think this book was great and the movie will be even better. Who ever will play Christian Grey will be hot and am hoping it will be Ryan Gosling. That book was so hot I started reading it again for the 2nd time. Big up's to E.L.James. I am a big fan i cant wait to see the movie next year.
B004Y12S9W|1.0|No sound, no picture... complete rip off.  Short review: don't buy.  Spend the money and get an actual apple product.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|\\"Oceania\\" is the perfect CD for people who love great Rock music and have a hard time finding it in new releases these days.  So many people keep listening to their old classic rock albums (Led Zeppelin, The Doors, etc.) or early `90s Grunge (Pearl Jam, Nirvana).<br /><br />Bands such as Led Zeppelin and The Doors obviously influenced the Smashing Pumpkins who were very much a part of early `90s Grunge, along with Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and others.  They released two CD's, \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,\\" that are timeless classics.  After those CD's and the death of Kurt Cobain, `90s Grunge started to die out.<br /><br />\\"Oceania\\" is an album that has all the greatness of the best CD's from that special era in music.  It actually sounds like it could have been released during that era or even during the height of the classic rock era.  The opening track \\"Quasar\\" is a hard rocker and got my attention immediately.  (Remember how Led Zeppelin II started with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and Led Zeppelin IV started with \\"Black Dog\\"?)  And continuing with the Led Zeppelin analogy, the Smashing Pumpkins know exactly when to slow down and give the listener the kind of lyrics that really touch the heart.  \\"The Celestials,\\" third track on \\"Oceania,\\" is a perfect example.<br /><br />Getting back to the Smashing Pumpkins, they are also completely different from any other rock band.  The reason is singer/songwriter/musician Billy Corgan, the band's frontman from the beginning.  He's one of those people who is so unusually talented and original that it's actually hard to believe that any one person can be so gifted.<br /><br />\\"Oceania\\" was released on June 19, 2012 and so far has not had much commercial success.  It might never have it.  It seems to be a bit lost in the shuffle.  So don't miss this one.  If you have been looking for a great Rock CD, and perhaps were not aware of \\"Oceania,\\" this CD is a Must Have.<br /><br />Other CD's Referenced:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002J03 Led Zeppelin II]]  [[ASIN:B0011Z5IVE Led Zeppelin IV]]  [[ASIN:B000MCIBE8 Doors]]  [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]]  [[ASIN:B000WQW988 Nirvana: Unplugged In New York]]  [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]]  [[ASIN:B005MW8CUG Siamese Dream]]  [[ASIN:B000000WA4 The Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness]]SIN:B000002J03 Led Zeppelin II]]  [[ASIN:B0011Z5IVE Led Zeppelin IV]]  [[ASIN:B000MCIBE8 Doors]]  [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]]  [[ASIN:B000WQW988 Nirvana: Unplugged In New York]]  [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]]  [[ASIN:B005MW8CUG Siamese Dream]]  [[ASIN:B000000WA4 The Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book. I had a Facebook friend reading it and suggested it, I am sooooo glad she did.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is helpful and gives you everything you need in a battery app, and then some more.  Great on my Kindle Fire
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My mother has Alzheimer's, and I read this book to get more insight into her thought processes. I have read many terrific books on the topic (My favorite is \\"How to speak Alzheimer's\\"), but this book gave me a greater understanding of what is happening and what is in store.  The book was particularly moving for me because I am a psychology professor, so I could not help putting myself into Alice's shoes.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like more insight into this disease, even if they are well-read on the topic. This book makes a unique contribution.
034580404X|5.0|I totally LOVED the trilogy!  I was so wishing it wouldn't end. What shall I read now???  I can only hope E.L. James continues to write and publish her works!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|You can definitely enjoy this game without spending a bunch of money.  would highly recommend setting parental controls on if letting kids pay or if you're worried about accidentally spending real money. great fun!
0802473156|5.0|Awesome easy read. Realizing your primary is simple once u discover yours and your spouse's everything will change...for the greater...if u choose to love him/her using their primary and secondary love language. Read it and gave it to my aunt and uncle. Like I said simple stuff with a profound impact. Already on page 24 of the five love languages for children so excited for what is in store for our family. Highly recommend for even a great marriage...it only gets better.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Hmm . . .After almost 800 reviews from friends and foes alike. . . 4 stars is stellar. I am here to say one thing: Listen with phones to every track  . . . if you ever liked VH then you will fork over the the $10  . . . and it is WELL worth it. This is a smokin CD and is very old school (think VH II meets 1984 meets DLR's Eat 'em and Smile). This is a GREAT reunion CD. Smokin EVH solos of yore! People who really know HR and HM are really giving this CD rave reviews (e.g. Eddie Trunk and the the guys at the HMS). There is no doubting this is a killer CD  . . .  I was totally thinking it would be a mediocre dud and best. NOPE&lt; It's a f'kng SMOKER on every track!!! nuff said.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this app on various devices for the last two years.  The performance has always been superb!  There are so many features that makes this app intuitive and extremely useful. The only complaint that I have is the wifi dependency for the notes and certain versions of the Bible....(This is an issue on my Kindle Fire)  Otherwise, this is my first choice for Bible applications out there...believe it or not there are others,  but they pale in comparison to YouVersion!
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Whatever else Karajan was, he was a great Bruckner conductor--for me, simply the greatest.<br /><br />I know a lot of others would nominate Furtw&auml;ngler, and who could blame them? Furtw&auml;ngler generates pure white heat. Every performance is a risky undertaking. Rhythms are in constant flux and everything is alive in the moment. For me, at least, every Furtw&auml;ngler performance seems wonderfully, terribly rooted in a particular time and place--the 22nd of October, 1951, Stuttgart, say; or the 7th of October, 1944, Berlin. These are unrepeatable miracles. When we hear Furtw&auml;ngler, in some sense we become witnesses to history. In the wartime recordings, this undoubtedly gives his performances an added frisson--goose steps and goosebumps (just to note the signs of the times, not to start a political debate).<br /><br />Karajan's approach is just about the opposite: his Bruckner is hard and chiseled, like Michelangelo working in cool white marble. With his steady pulses, I think Karajan strove to make Bruckner as eternal and perfect as the Piet&agrave; in St. Peter's Basilica.<br /><br />We've all heard the clich&eacute; that Bruckner created \\"cathedrals of sound\\" and I'm a more than a little loathe to repeat it, but here goes: to my ears, Karajan's Brucknerian cathedrals surpass all others in terms of symmetry and beauty, grace and splendor.<br /><br />I've always thought that, in common with Bach's work but few others, Bruckner's symphonies have the beauty and brilliance of a mathematical proof. Karajan did the math.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|did not like it at all.  the plot was boring.  all of the actors did a very terrible job acting.
B0013D89YM|5.0|ELO out of the blue is a fantastic album, that was way ahead of its time! (Probably why you hear so many songs from that album now on commercials and in movies.<br />I have purchased this on vinyl, 8 track, tape, CD....twice! And now downloaded (hopefully this won't wear out)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I'm a IT tech for a national corporation and went to troubleshoot a wireless network. The location was a multi floor hotel. they had multiple access points and wireless routers installed throughout the complex. I was able to use this app to locate and place the access points and wireless routers for optimal coverage through the hotel. It made my job so much easier. thanks for writing this app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is sooo fun and addicting you should totally get it, it is worth getting I love playing it sooo much!!it is so worth getting go and get it!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was compelling, but not very original.  Think  the short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" meets the TV show \\"Big Brother\\" and you'll get the general idea.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's only slightly frustrating at times. but the music helps to calm. It's also fun to go back and try for a perfect score.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very good graphics. Very smooth play. so many levels to keep you challenged. best $10.00 I spent. Wait..  It is Free!!!<br />Great game...
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The writing was immature, boring and unimaginative; there was a lot of redundancy.  Though a quick read, it was not the least bit fulfilling.  This holds true for all books in the trilogy.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I get it. I understand that the reason they remixed the full Beatles catalogue in stereo with modern compression and limiting was to appeal to more modern audiences and to compete with the sounds of modern recordings.<br /><br />But they didn't need to. This box set sounds so good. I myself, an avid Beatles fanatic, was astounded at just how much I was missing by not having heard the original mono mixes of their music. The mixes are much more balanced, with all the various elements in each recording interacting with one another to achieve a much more consistent soundscape in comparison to the stereo mixes. Not to mention that the mono mixes just have, something that's a little hard to describe...it's like they have more THUMP to them. A lot of the songs use entirely different takes in which the band are really rocking. They're more \\"raw\\" and honest. It's awesome to listen to. Revolver sounds better than ever, while Beatles For Sale turns into one of my favorite albums. And then there's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which morphs into an entirely different experience, and I finally understand (and agree with) it's standing as one of the great albums of all time.<br /><br />I also like that this set includes things like the unreleased mono mixes of the Yellow Submarine songs, and the original stereo mixes of Help! and Rubber Soul (which really highlight how vastly different stereo mixing was approached). It adds a nice touch in tying the whole set together and reflects that a great level of care and quality was put into it.<br /><br />I love this box set. I know I'm not the first to say so, but it really can't be said enough: this is the way The Beatles should be heard!

B008MEM24S|5.0|I got the free version on my iPod. I'll get the full on my fire, because it has a bigger screen.
B00280LYHS|4.0|it had many cliff hangers in the series and th last bok did to and that is why i liked it.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|The Richard Donner cut version was worth watching, but it was not really as good as the released version.  The Donner version repeated the first Superman movie to change the past, while in the released version Superman simply did some unexplained hocus pocus on Lois' memory that he was Clark Kent.  Neither version was satisfactory, but I preferred the released version which did not have to change world history to affect Lois' memory.  It was good to see a few other scenes that had been cut.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is one of the best tools to use to support productivity and track ideas that develop when not near a Pc. I also like the fact that I can get to it on my tablet and Pc. Its helpful and usable. Great tool.
B000093BDX|5.0|great mix of some of the  best hits beach boys have recorded.  not all have the most updated sound quality.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The writing in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games book's are so captivating, that I took the book with me everywhere I went and couldn't wait to read more. The story itself is so different than a lot of books I've read and the suspense of the story line just kept me wanting to know what would happend next? The characters are expertly crafted. Loved the style of it being written through the eyes ( and voice) of the main character. I would highly reccomend this Triology book series if you like great writing and also suspense mixed with action adventure. When I read book 3, I started reading it slower, because I didn't want it to end!
B004TJ1H2I|4.0|I'm not going to spend too much time talking about the intrinsic qualities of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY - chances are you have already seen the film, or have decided a long time ago that it isn't your type of movie.  As for myself, TGTBTU is -to use an overworked cliche - one of my all-time favorites.  I think it goes beyond the genre of western, although it certainly adheres to its conventions, and is simply a remarkably well-done and entertaining film.  Whether it actually does or not, there are moments in the film where I feel the action onscreen illuminates aspects of what it means to be human, which are otherwise extremely difficult to communicate.  That it does this despite considerable flaws is interesting in itself - it is almost as if those elements that I percieve to be unnecessary or poorly done were crucial to the script as a sort of baseline from which the truly great moments of the film could stand out in stark relief.<br /><br />And that, in a nutshell, is why I probably will not ever watch this version again.  I've seen this film so many times that I know almost every scene, every bit of dialog by heart.  It is more like a static painting that I can see something new in each time I look at it, or be thrilled by the same scenes over and over.  This particular version has cut footage re-inserted into the film, which was then dubbed by an older Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach, as well as another actor who substituted for Lee Van Cleef.  In and of themselves, they are interesting, but re-embedded into the film, the effect is if someone discovered that an earlier study for 'Guernica' contained an additional figure, and so decided it would be a good idea to pencil it in now.  Ok, perhaps that's extreme, but I found no value to having the additional scenes shoe-horned into the film - it is a long film as it is, which one might even consider to be one of the flaws in the production in the first place.  Adding additional material - which does not add in any way to the overall understanding of the events on screen - is really pushing it.<br /><br />Are the audio and visual aspects of the film improved?  Yes, tremendously.  There are also two commentary tracks, two documentaries on Leone, one on the Civil War campaign which TGTBTU takes place around, and two on Ennio Morricone.  All of this makes it even more disappointing that the additional scenes are embedded in the film regardless of whether the viewer wants them there or not.  Couldn't both versions of the film been included?  I don't see why not.  Then those of us who feel any disruption of the film we've become accustomed to over the years is an unwelcome intrusion, one that changes the actual experience, could pick the film that suited us best.<br /><br />I bought this blu-ray when it dipped below ten bucks.  I wish I'd waited for a version that better suited my preferences.
B000003337|5.0|Is if Sharon Osbourne (Ozzy's Wife and Manager) is going to release the live concerts of Randy Rhoads playing live in concert on DVD because they just released a new version of Speak of the Devil on DVD after the plane accident when Randy Rhoads died which featured the lead guitarist for Night Ranger Brad Gillis on guitar that is rare indeed, I want to see the video/s of Randy Rhoads in performance complete. Especially if they have the video of Ozzy and Randy at that concert that was featured on the cover of the Tribute concert CD as that alone is an iconic image.

B007YQ8D5W|5.0|Just like the Days of Grays, this album requires some patience to really appreciate. I loved the Wildfire continuation, and The Day is a touching and emotional song. It took three full listens to really grasp this album, but it is well worth it for any fan of the band or prog-rock in general. Overall this album features slower riffs and more emotional melodies than their previous work, with plenty of fast double time riffs mixed in.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I never thought I would need this app! Now I have it and I love it! This app shows everything about everything on your Kindle Fire. From how much battery life is left to how much time is spent on the apps you play most! It's a great app!
0425263908|1.0|As everyone else has said here the entire book is too close to 50 Shades of Grey.  But I think my favorite part was in her acknowledgements she thanks E.L. James for creating a fan base for this type of literature.
1449320104|5.0|This is a very good general read as well as desktop reference. Covers some new stuff, not so much focused on app-specific programming as 'language/library' feature coverage. It is the book I most often have open lately at work and several co-workers liked it and got copies.

B007PEIHKE|5.0|The Grandstream HT702 was very quick and easy to set up, using instructions provided by CallCentric. It's highly customizable, although most of the defaults are working well enough for me. It works exactly as advertised.

034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed this series of books. The way the author brings to like some things is amazing. I can't wait to read more from this author.
1579128955|2.0|I quite enjoyed the book, both the text and the photos. However, I must protest that after reading it in my house over a few evenings, gently, the book has practically fallen apart in my hands. The pages have become unglued from the spine. I would expect the book to hold together for longer than one reading, as it's the sort of book I'd like to browse over and over, and show my kids. I'm worried it has a half life of 100 days.
0062060562|3.0|Watson begins with a frightening premise and keeps one's full attention for the first half of the book. However, this reader gradually found it too repetitive, thought the plot required more action, until by the end, I was weary of both Christine and \\"Ben\\".
0061450162|4.0|It's no secret that Neil Gaiman is a master story-teller. This book contains a lot of short stories, so there is a lot of variety. Some are better than others. Some are longer than others. Some are funnier than others. But all are interesting and pleasant to read. I think my favourites are the \\"bonus\\" story in the prologue, the angelic murder mystery, and of course the alternate take on the Snow White fairy tale.
B005PK1G76|2.0|I needed something like this for a chicco umbrella stroller, but after a couple of uses the metal bent from the times the stroller was closed.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Yes, finally, the Worst Book Ever Written [...] has competition !!  In fact, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is SLIGHTLY better than the rollicking adventures of Grignr, but only by virtue of its' lack of atrocious spelling and grammar. Others have noted the utter impossibility of the male lead, a man so utterly perfect that he makes Edward Cullen of the \\"Twilight\\" series look like a homeless, drunken bum in comparison.<br /><br />This is not a book to read: this is a book to use for paper-mache, filling cracks in the wall, and a reasonable substitute for toilet tissue.  If you're not looking for a product to fill any of those listed needs, avoid this book at all costs!!!
B00000J7J7|5.0|Every now and then I think, are all these complex notes being played,are they written out ?  It sound's like a classical & Jazz recital combined,but, more complex than any classical piece I'm ever heard. I have at least 30 jazz /Classical solo piano recording's;Tatum,Johnny Costa,Pascal Roge, Alicia Della Rocha etc. How can it get better than this;use of the sustain & soft pedal with out blurring the notes except when creating a middle or lower register growl and is also buoyant in his approach. The left hand is not an after thought here, but an equal partner in his music. Both hand's are confident and know where their going at ALL times. There is pathos,reflectiveness & romantic tones,and some joy.<br />In the booklet, BRAD MEHLDAU expresses his philosophy on life & music. As I'm typing this review,his music is coming through my headphones and confirms what I have just expressed in print. Time:56:49  Steinway.
B008B37C8Q|5.0|Frank Zappa was a master at creating great and complex music and most of his albums prove the fact that he truly is a master at music. This is one of those albums. \\"We're Only In It For The Money\\" is able to be fun to listen to and tell about the establishment , the hippies, and the counterculture of the 60s.  You can hear Frank talk about the hippies in \\" Who Needs The Peace Corps\\" and the establishment and flower power children in \\"Flower Punk\\". This is a timeless masterpiece of the music from the 60s and the how the music from that time was able to tell stories of what was going on at that time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to hear music from the 60s and to any Frank Zappa fans.
B007SGM084|3.0|I ordered this series of books due to all the talk about them. If you like Harlequin romances with a slight edge, then you will like these books.  The character of Christian Grey is interesting and I hope the book will give a reasonable explanation as to the reason he behaves as he does.  The appeal of the character of Anastasia, however, is a puzzle.  There is nothing compelling about this whiny character which would in any way explain Mr. Grey's obsession with her.  The book is very poorly written. I have to wonder about the author's editor, allowing all the repetitious descriptions.  During the sex scenes I find myself wishing she would just stop all the inner dialogue, the endless \\"Holy Crap, Cow\\" etc outbursts. Ana seems to be of marginal intelligence, despite her much ballyhooed GPA - she was astonished that at her graduation ceremony, Mr. Grey, an invited speaker, was going to make a speech - another Holy whatever outburst. The sex scenes are hot, but very redundant.  And yes, for the hundredth time, we know about his long fingers and all that infers.  With a different female character (maybe showing the thoughts of an actual submissive and how she came to prefer that kind of lifestyle) the book would be much more interesting. I will most likely never buy anything written by this author again, but if people are looking for mindless entertainment and sexually stimulating prose, try to block out all the inner goddess crap and indulge in the guilty pleasure that is this book.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I've never been so disappointed with a book series in my life. This was NOT erotica. Maybe for beginners it is.
B002MEW7YY|4.0|SPOILER ALERT: Don't read this if you are unaware of the \\"gimmick\\" in this production.<br />One of my favorite arias in the whole wide world is \\"Regnava nel silencio,\\" and I was happily waiting for it.  Then, when Netrebko launched into it, there appeared in the background right behind her the gimmick of this Victorian-era production, the Ghost.  It ruined it for me because it totally distracted from the singing.<br />Furthermore, there are many great sopranos who sing Lucia effectively, but the final scene of the opera belongs to Edgardo, and the Edgardo should be the counterweight of the Lucia but frequently isn't.  Based on an Opera News review, I bought the Scotto-Bergonzi \\"Lucia\\" because Bergonzi does such a knock-out job of singing Edgardo in it.<br />Well, in the final act of this \\"Lucia\\" poor Piotr Beczala is also fervently, passionately singing his heart out as Edgardo, but he has to do so while lying on his back on the floor with Netrebko, who is now the Ghost, stealing his thunder by writhing all over him.  It was a terrible distraction, and it spoiled my enjoyment of his wonderful performance.
0345803485|1.0|I was disappointed with this book immensely. It has been given a lot of hype but I was not impressed with it in any way. I found the writings by the author offensive and demeaning to intellectual women everywhere. I found nothing romantic about it.
B000286SCO|2.0|While I will admit Dream Theater is a GREAT GROUP with top players, I was completely PISSED OFF that nothing is mentioned about the Deep Purple cover song \\"Perfect Strangers\\" being a couple short \\"clips\\" shot in a studio, maybe 30 seconds of what looks and sounds as if it were recorded by the world's worst camcorder...<br /><br />My whole point to purchase this DVD was to enjoy seeing them play Perfect Strangers one of my favorite songs ever... Misleading information and makes me not like the entire DVD.
0345803485|5.0|This book is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. E.L James has a fascinating imagination, I can't think of a way that this book could have been any better.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Best book bundle I've ever bought. And glad that they can't get ruined by water or any one! Bought these before I had time to read them, so I'm waiting for a free day to read!
B007L96SI6|4.0|I must say I was a tiny bit disappointed in the pop sound of every song.  When on Idol, Haley was very bluesy and quite a bit rock, and none of that is on this album.  I love her voice, and love almost every song, too, thus a 4 star rating.  I just wish there were more of Haley and less of the producers.  I would have been happier with a blues/pop/rock mix!  I hope when Elise Testone (from the most current season of Idol) releases her album she sticks to what she loves and doesn't deliver a pop album like this one.  HALEY CAN SAAANG, THOUGH!
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I recently purchased a Canon T3i.  I got it almost exclusively for video work (I already own DSLRs and have a good lens collection).  Anyhow, the on-board audio on the Canon T3i is terrible.  I've also used a Nikon DSLR (model?) for video and had the same issue.  I guess I should point out that my opinion about video production is that audio recording is critical to the overall result.  This microphone solves the problems of the newer DSLR issues around audio.  The mic records mono, but the input plug carries the signal to two channels giving you dual mono into your stereo input, so you don't have to correct it in production later on (or with extra signal splitting plugs).  The quality of the mic is outstanding.  You will need to experiment with the settings in your camera and on the mic to get the best balance of volume and hiss.  I did some experimenting, and I set my Canon T3i to manual audio and click the gain to 8 or 9 clicks above zero (about 20%).  I then set the mic to +20 on the gain.  This seems to give me a good clean signal.  Other settings give alot more hiss or not enough amplitude.  I also use the mic on my HF G10 camcorder.  I use a different balance on the G10 (default settings on both the camera and mic seems to work fine).  It offers a more targeted pick up than the onboard G10 mics, and I use the deadcat wind shield to eliminate wind problems when outside.  I did have to purchase a shoe adapter for the G10 because the Canon \\"advanced mini-shoe\\" is incompatible (too small).<br /><br />It's expensive, especially with the deadcat and mini-shoe adapter, but overall worth it if you shoot with a DSLR or intend to shoot outdoors with a camera that lacks a good wind screen.<br /><br />Others have commented about the thin cable, and I agree that it is too tender.  The complaints about the shock mount are unfounded.  I have found it to be of an excellent build and have not had any problems with it dismounting, even when I have been less than gentle with it.<br /><br />The 9 volt battery is wonderful, although please remember to take it out before going through airport security.  The battery alone attracted special attention from homeland security on a recent trip.  On the return flight, I removed the battery ahead of time and had no problems.  The \\"on\\" light is my favorite feature (I have several powered mics with out a light, and have burnt through countless batteries in my forgetfulness).<br /><br />I do teach video production, so I guess I'm a professional of sorts.  I don't think I would recommend spending this much for casual video production (like home movies).  You might be satisfied with a less expensive mic.  Try Audio-Technica.  They seem to offer decent mics for much less, however the audiophiles out there will not be pleased with anything less than the Rode VMP..<br /><br />The 9 volt battery is wonderful, although please remember to take it out before going through airport security.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|easy to use, works really well, pictures come out perfect with all of the options to edit. love this app.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Rotate triangular reflectors to direct a pulse towards targets.  Additional game-play elements like breakable blocks and teleporters are added as you progress.  Occasionally tight timing sometimes produces frustration rather than challenge.  Not a game that I would play for hours on end, but good for 10-15 minutes at a time.  A level editor is included and you can download user created levels.<br /><br />I would probably rate this a solid 3 stars, but presentation merits an additional star.  The graphics are done in a blueprint style, with nice touches like objects that pulse in time with the music and erasure marks on the paper styled background.  Groovy lounge style music is catchy and doesn't get annoying after repeated listens.<br /><br />Plays fine on Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game is extremely boring and tedious. i dont know how its rated so high ... the game sucks big time.

0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris delivers a wonderful easy read that will both have you laughing and make you think. This is my first time reading anything from this author but I will be sure to grab another of his works off the shelf soon. When You Are Engulfed In Flames is a collection of short stories or essays  that seem to follow different times of his life and chronicle some astute, if not absurd, observations and actions. His witty humor is often pointed inwards as well as outwards to society and reveals his personal genius in writing as you review some of his exploits from youth through his present day life. The nature of his writing in short contained stories was also a personal pleasure for me. It was easy to  fit in during the busy days and always felt familiar when I picked it up again as he was interwoven reoccurring characters from his life through most, if not all, of the stories.<br /><br />  He works his magic by frequently changing focus through the storyline while maintaining the original plot through to the end. As he describes a nice day in his apartment, he may take you on a rampage through the evils of wallpaper patterns or his ability to make coffee with the water from a freshly picked bouquet of flowers given to him by his partner. His observations of other people may even be considered offensive, but coming from a self described whiny push-over of a homosexual man, you come to honor and appreciate his unique perspective and the truths embedded in his articles. At first I took his telling of these hidden truths as somewhat funny by the sarcastic and self loathing way he writes, but then the honesty and sincerity of his views crept in and I came to appreciate the laughter in a different way. The way you would appreciate your friend privately telling you that there was a bit of lettuce on your chin when you're on a double date with someone way out of your league, or the way you appreciate the familiar song your mother sang when she used to cook dinner.<br /><br />  In his chapter \\"The Man in the Hut\\" he tells of his stay in France and of a special \\"slow\\" and \\"gentle\\" neighbor. The serious tale of a not so right family, sexual abuse, and the recently released from prison father, are punctuated by brief points of humor. His easy manner and willingness to go along with almost anything coupled with his limited knowledge of the language add to his self created predicament. He views the man as a harmless person to be pitied and tries to hide his inability to say no to such a harmless man from his partner and neighbors. Only in reflection does he weigh the consequences of his actions as they may impact his partner and their social standing. In his own way, he tells his tale and has you laughing at his absurd thoughts about keeping up appearances and the selfish thought of receiving discounts on train fare from someone he shouldn't be associating with. This book will make you think about some of your own motivations as well as keep you laughing. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys an humorous read and does not take themselves too seriously. I look forward to the next Sedaris book I pick up./>  In his chapter \\"The Man in the Hut\\" he tells of his stay in France and of a special \\"slow\\" and \\"gentle\\" neighbor.

B007Q476KU|5.0|After reading and enjoying the book [[ASIN:0545403359 War Horse: (Movie Cover)]], I was looking forward to the movie, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The plot was well-crafted and moved along at a good pace; not so slow you were waiting for it to end, but not so fast you couldn't get what was going on. It stuck to the book closely (that's always a plus!), and I think that you don't need to read the book to enjoy the movie. Small details might make more sense if you have read it, but everything will still fall into place if you haven't.<br />The scenery was stunning and filmed well, and the four horses who portrayed Topthorn had to have been the most gorgeous horses I have ever seen - though Joey himself was beautiful. I don't think the film got melodramatic, either. I thought it was realistic and sometimes a little subtle.<br />The acting, too, was good by everyone. Jeremy Irvine played Albert well, and I felt for him as he worried for and trained Joey. Emily Watson and Peter Mullan were both very good in their supporting roles, providing realistic portrayals of Albert's parents. As I had watched the Harry Potter movies, it was very nice to see David Thewlis (who was Remus Lupin in Harry Potter) again.<br /><br />The World War l aspect of the story was, not surprisingly, very sad. However, I didn't find it visually disgusting (it wasn't graphic), and throughout the movie there was bits of humor that lightened the story.<br />Although the book was from Joey's point-of-view, the movie expanded some and we got to see the soldiers converse in their rooms and see more of the Frenchman and his granddaughter than we did in the book, which I liked.<br />I don't think Joey was overtly intelligent, I thought he acted like a horse (And in a good way. It didn't portray the horses as stupid animals, but it didn't make them human, either). It was thrilling to see him galloping through No Man's Land, trying to escape, until he finally runs into the barbed wire, and two soldiers-British and German-temporarily join forces to free the tangled animal. The reunion between Albert and Joey was sweet, and you could really see the connection between the boy and his horse. The ending was perfect and wasn't prolonged or chopped short.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this movie, unless you can't stand animals dying or war.

1439102732|1.0|Oh Jodi, Jodi, Jodi... you're breaking my heart! After \\"Nineteen Minutes\\", I hold you to a high standard as a novelist. I expect you to challenge me, confound me, rivet me to your story. You haven't done that now in awhile. What's gone wrong? Why are you selling out like this-- churning out tripe dressed up with gimmicks, trotted out in a shopworn formula?<br /><br />You're a prolific author, but that in itself is not necessarily a good thing. I still believe you have provocative and compelling ideas for your novels, and that you research them decently. I still believe your novels are worth reading...or, at least, I desperately hope they will be, as they once were.<br /><br />Sadly, SYH was terrible. I knew it was your writing, of course. It had your trademark \\"hot button issue\\" of the day, narrated by three or four of your characters at the heart of the sh*tstorm, alternating perspectives that seemed as predictable as the various fonts in play. The plot led inevitably to a showdown in the courthouse, as usual. I wonder, is it ever possible for your characters to work out their differences without lawyers and legalese? I'm beginning to suspect that your novels are little more than thinly disguised case studies for law or policy students; how else to explain the ludicrous contrivances of the plot necessary to create a precedent-setting case? If you are looking for a new career writing for this market, fine. But then you cease to be a novelist. Literature, or fiction, needs to be creative. Imaginative. Cathartic. What your novels used to be.<br /><br />Maybe you need to take some time off from writing. Maybe you need a new publisher. I don't know. Maybe you're locked into a contract and have no choice but to deliver by deadlines set for you by your corporate masters.<br /><br />If so, maybe we as your fans need to petition your publishers to let you take a sabbatical. To stop flogging you to produce like a puppy mill, so you can recharge. Get your mojo back. Take the time you need to make your next novel worth the wait, worthy of the reputation you established for yourself with your earlier works.<br /><br />You have a loyal fan base--you've earned it. I can't speak for any but myself, but I, at least, would sign a petition like this.time you need to make your next novel worth the wait, worthy of the reputation you established for yourself with your earlier works.<br /><br />You have a loyal fan base--you've earned it.

030758836X|4.0|Like everyone else, I devoured this book in a single sitting. It's really, really good. SPOILERS START HERE: The first big reveal that Amy was framing Nick was absolutely THRILLING and I was hooked. But from then on out, the action for me was all about Amy getting her comeuppance. I was sticking with it to see Nick finally get his vindication, Bony finally become the likely hero, Go to get to punch Amy in the face. That was the payoff, and it didn't come. Moreover the twists with Desi and everything just kinda didn't work for me. I could handle Amy as a woman scorned and even root for her, but once she became a murderer I just hated her. Also I did not think the ambiguous ending worked here; I hope there is a sequel where Amy gets hers. If this happens, I'll come back and change my review from four stars to five. Anyway, it's definitely a delicious read and much better than 90% of the stuff out there. I look forward to her next book!
0143114085|2.0|Why this was a 'international bestseller' is beyond me. I read the back, saw the blurbs and wondered how I had missed such a gem. Just lucky I guess. The plot was just unbelievable. and the characters had so little depth that it didn't matter what they did, none of it made much sense. Alice is a wimp, Charlie is nuts--for no real reason, Simon is so confusing I began to think he was crazy and behind the whole thing. David was a mama's boy who turned into a sadist, then back again, with no reason??? Dead wife Laura didn't even make sense. What did she know and when did she know it--and why didn't she tell anyone?  Sheesh--the only one to slightly make sense was Vivienne but then again--no not really...she was cruel, kind, all knowing, oblivious, steady, mercurial, controlling and unconcerned...argh. Also, with the way the book jumped not only between characters but points in time...obviously why there were dates on the chapters.<br />Just not much to enjoy here--
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|First I want to say that the Percy/Annabeth reunion was amzing, although I can't help but wonder what the Romans thought. I had no problems at 53%, although I had a drama with the Kindle breaking just before the book loaded- I was in hysterics!- and everything was fine.<br />This story was tyld from 4 view points, but I thought that Riordan should have included Hazel, after all, they were questing to save her brother. This story was definitely Annabeths, and I was very happy to finally get her POV.<br />This book exceded all expectations and is easily the best in the series. The one thing I did not like about this book was the cliffhanger at the end, although it makes me even more excited about the next book. It's going to be a long wait until next year!<br />Lots of excitement, most of my predictions came true, and a few unexpected twists and turns. All I can say about this book is; &#34;Keep on piroetting Otis!&#34;
B000YJ54DU|5.0|As always, an entertaining experience, filled with Reacher action, precise detail, and justice served Reacher-style.  A quick read, well-done, that met my usual high expectations for a Lee Child book.
B008645YEE|5.0|This was a great score to listen to. I loved every single moment in it. When I heard it in the motion picture itself, it was perfect. Perhaps one of Hans Zimmer best music.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Keith Richards has always fascinated me.  He's one of the greatest rock and roll guitarists, composers, and performers of all time, not to mention one of the most notorious.  Listening to him in interviews, I marveled at his clarity in remembering fine details about so many stories.  And after reading this book, written/told by Keith himself, I once again marveled at his thoughtfulness and details, and in particular, his very Keith-specific way with turning a phrase.  You know instantly that this is his story, not told from other sources, in his words, in his way.  Perfect.<br />And it is a story indeed, told from beginning to end.  No fluff, no hyperbole, no tip-toeing around issues and experiences.  It's all laid out in fine and sometimes messy detail, full disclosure, with Keith's wittiness and sentimentality fully engaged and in full force.  You'll come to know his upbringing, parents and extended family, the struggles he endured and survived.  And yes, the successes and all the pitfalls that came with being a rock and roll star in the early days.  Keith doesn't hold back, reveals his true thoughts in great detail and in the colorful language only he can muster up.  You'll live through his life - early struggles, quick and rapid success, excesses, love life, birth and loss of children, personal relationships, fun and folly, and go to the brink of death and back - riding on every word and detail he provides.<br />A constant undercurrent of the book is the tumultuous yet enduring friendship with Mick Jagger and other members of the Stones.  Keith gives a fascinating look into their quarrels and conflicts - particularly with Mick, and how they reach the depths of hate and somehow find their way back to co-existing.  It's a relationship much like that between family members, volatile yet a loving one at its core.<br />But most endearing and revealing, is the glorious symmetry of language he uses: poetic, abrupt, lovely, fluid, course and vulgar, and then gentle andgenerous.  It gradually becomes clear that this man, with a mind like his, is indeed capable of writing some of our greatest rock songs.  He is quite frankly, genius.<br /><br />Keith has live an amazing and interesting life.  Actually, after reading the book you realize, yes, this cat has nine lives and he's lived every one of them to the fullest.  And man, can he tell a story........bless his heart!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was looking forward to reading a stimulating new trilogy by an author unknown to me, when what I found was anything but stimulating; no interesting plot, strong female characters or intelligent dialogue.  Instead, what I read was heavy in pornography, low in intellect, easily led weak female lead and severly retarded lead male.But I chose to read on when the female lead finally showed a bit of spine at the end of this first book in the trilogy, so I'm reading the second book now.
B007SGM084|3.0|The premise for this story is more than a little far fetched.  The writing matches the story though, amateurish.  I'm glad I didn't buy the hard copy.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Okay. I'm not going to lie. I love her writing; her ability to turn a phrase, capture a scene and make a real character. The story was intense... At first. But it just fizzles. It was like she couldnt come up with a justifiable reason for these two awful people to...well i wont spoil it. It was either that or she got lazy and  threw stuff together to end it. Other reviewers have said \\"people who don't like the ending don't understand it\\". Well, I do understand the ending. But the reasoning for this understanding is lame and isn't how people in the realworld act. I know these people are crazy (one more so than the other) which is why I find it so terribly unbelievable.<br /><br />So in closing. Ehh.

It's that good.

B0019O6IWU|5.0|This is a very surprising book and one that should be widely read. With clarity and with impressive real-life examples, Marshall Rosenberg presents a very simple and refreshing viewpoint about expressing oneself from the heart with authenticity and tact at the same time -- a tough tightrope to walk, unless you have read the secrets within the book.

B003JOA0U4|5.0|I love the compact design of this flash drive. It has a retractable flash drive so there's no need to worry about losing a clip. It's also a sturdy stainless steel frame design, so you are sure it is sturdy and secure. I have a LOT of files that I don't trust to external flash drives, and I often have to take my large files with me. I combine them with the waterproof SURVIVOR flash drives. I have those 2 survivors and 6 of the A-data carabiner clips secured to a ball link chain so that in an event of an emergency, I can just grab all my materials and run if I have to! Do I trust the 'cloud' - hahahahahahahaha
B00899DV6O|4.0|Love this album. Lots of awesome songs on it. Definitely will be using some for Hip Hop class this season.
030758836X|5.0|The owner of our local indie book store recommended this for me and I LOVED it. Everytime I thought I knew and understood a character, the author slipped in something new that turned everything upside down. Wow!! I went through liking, hating, feeling sorry for...basically all emotions with each character. While the end was wonderfully surprising, I wasn't shocked. I've seen similar in real life.<br /><br />And that's all I'm going to give you. No need for me to ruin the experience for you by giving any details.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|I really enjoyed picross on the DS, so I was thrilled to try out this game.  It's got lots of puzzles and it seems to get updated with more puzzles pretty regularly.<br /><br />There's a couple of things that I'd like to see improved, though:<br /><br />- better accuracy for clicks (perhaps it's the kindle fire and not the developer's fault, but I feel like this often misses where I wanted to click.  Thank goodness for the undo button!)<br /><br />- better zoom in interface -- if you can't get click accuracy, making it possible to zoom in helps a lot, but doing so makes it hard to see what row you're on and what those numbers were.  you can click to bring up the numbers briefly, but they disappear when you click.  It'd be great if you could zoom in and toggle the number display on so that it stays on while you mark squares.<br /><br />- The latest update seems to have integrated with some social gaming thing and there's no way to opt out or much explanation of what's going on there.  Ugh!  If you're going to integrate that stuff, couldn't you just use Amazon's leaderboard/achievement/save game thing?  please?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm not even done with the book yet , so maybe I'll right another review once I've gotten through the whole book , but as soon as I was about 5 chapters into the book it screamed STEPHANIE MEYERS TWILIGHT TRILOGY ! I truthfully had to keep checking the front to see who the author if the book was . And as I read more and more (hilarious) reviews I could see the serious repetition of the facial expressions , and body language , I mean sometimes you have to let their actions speak for them... But shut those chatterboxes up before the beome overwhelming . Now even as I am writing this review I STILL will finish the book and STILL go on to read the next two . And I will write a review about those also . xx
B005LAIIPS|4.0|With Matt Damon having departed as the charismatic Jason Bourne after three movies, the producers had to come up with a clever way to keep this franchise moving forward. They could either simply take another actor continue the role of Jason Bourne (much in the same way that the James Bond franchise keeps it going), or they could come up with a new story line separate (but not apart) from Jason Bourne. The producers decided on the latter.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" (135 min.) introduces us to Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), who is another Jason Bourne-like former Army soldier rescued and enhanced by an experimental CIA program. For reasons not entirely made clear (to me anyway), the decision is made to shut down this program and all of the field agents are cast off, with the sole exception of Aaron Cross, who manages to dodge the various attempts on his life. Meanwhile we are also introduced to Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz), who is involved in the running of the program, and for reasons I don't want to explain so as not to spoil too much of the plot, now also is running for her life. Aaron and Marta team up, and how exactly it all plays out, you will just have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Several comments: there are a number of hair-raising action scenes, none more so than in the last 45 min. of the movie, at which point all of the action takes places in Manila, the Phillipines. The action scenes are staged brilliantly and are never so over the top that they become laughable. Jason Renner does a great job in bringing us \\"the next Jason Bourne\\". But Rachel Weisz is the REAL star in my opinion. This is the 3rd time in short order that I've seen her recently in the theatres (after Dream House and The Deep Blue Sea), and she completely transfixes me, as she does again in this movie. Kudos also to writer-director (and \\"Bourne\\" veteran) Tony Gilroy, for bringing it all together in a credible and thoroughly enjoyable way. In the end, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" exceeded all my expectations, and as such is an outstanding addition to the \\"Bourne\\" franchise. Can't wait for the next installment already!ne Legacy\\" exceeded all my expectations, and as such is an outstanding addition to the \\"Bourne\\" franchise.

B007OCD1OO|5.0|Simply Red ceased as a group at the end of their final tour in 2010 but they still have avid fans around the world. Those fans are going to be thrilled to have made available to them this great, new concert DVD, Simply Red Live at Montreux 2003.<br /><br />Filmed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2003 (filmed in high def and recorded in DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby Digital 5.1, LPCM Stereo), the performance spans the band's entire career that drove close to 50 million in album sales and world-wide fame.  There's also the extra added bonus tracks (seven in all) from the band's 2010 performance that are just icing on the cake. The band in both performances are tight and Mick Hucknall's voice is as smoothly great as ever.<br /><br />With twenty-five tracks to pick from, it's impossible to pick three favorites so I'll highlight three, instead.  First, is Enough from the 1989 album, A New Flame. Flawless. Beautiful.  Smooth. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to the performance of just his one tune.  Love it!<br /><br />The second choice would have to be the brilliant cover of the Stylistics hit, You Make Me Feel Brand New.  Hucknall knocks this one straight out of the park with his incredible ability to sing three different vocal parts.  I believe this one performance alone is worth the purchase of the DVD.<br /><br />Finally, the ingenious Sunrise rounds out the short list of choices.  The fact that the band could (and I hate to use the word again but it fits) flawlessly perform this tune that is partially based on the sampling of the Hall & Oates tune,  I Can't Go For That (No Can Do) is nothing short of courageous and amazing.<br /><br />Not only do I think that Simply Red Live at Montreux 2003 will be loved by fans, I think this DVD can - and will - single-handedly create new fans who wished they were turned on to them sooner.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com

B007R3AZNK|5.0|In my review of Joe Bonamassa's recent concert DVD, Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theater Live From New York, I wrote: \\"Okay, so here's the deal.  Boomerocity is such a HUGE Joe Bonamassa fan that, by all accounts, every review we post should just read, `Love it. Buy it. Now!  This review is no different.\\"<br /><br />What I wrote then holds true now:  Love it. Buy it. Now!<br /><br />For you tough ones who need convincing, here it goes.<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa is, in Boomerocity's opinion, the pre-eminent guitarist of this generation.  The young guitar prodigy is well beyond his years in writing, playing and performing and it shows in Driving Towards the Daylight.<br /><br />The album has much of the same \\"hounds of Hell at the crossroads\\" sound that Bonamassa served up on his last album, Dust Bowl. You get that vibe from the first cut, Dislocated Boy, which is one of the four songs written by Joe.<br /><br />Another great Bonamassa written tune is the title track.  It oozes loneliness and desperation like no other song written in recent days.  This tune has already been worthy of infinite slaps of the repeat button, it's that great.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this tune is picked up in the country charts either as recorded by Joe or recorded by someone like, say, Rascal Flatts.<br /><br />A Place in My Heart is another - if not the - Boomerocity favorite.  It sounds as though it might have been a tune written for the album he did with Beth Hart, Don't Explain and could've easily segued into or out of I'd Rather Go Blind.  For that matter, I'd betcha a dollar to a Krispy Kreme donut (glazed and fresh out of the oven) that Sir Joe seques this song into Gary Moore's Still Got The Blues (for You) during at least one live performance. If it does, I sure hope that it makes it onto his next concert DVD . . . or, at least, shows up on YouTube (hint, hint).<br /><br />While much could be written about each and every song on the album, that would take all the fun away.  However, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible treatment given to the Jimmy Barnes song (co-written Boomerocity friend, Jonathan Cain, Neal Schon, Randy Jackson and Tony Brock).  Oh, and Barnes provides the vocals on the tune, as well. All I can say is, \\"amazing\\"!<br /><br />Oh, something else I can say, too: Love it. Buy it.

B0033AX1YG|5.0|I bought this knowing it was going to great, and im not dissapointed, its a great slice of his 90's work that shows how diverse he could be in playing and writing. I love all of it, maybe some might be put off with the slightly jangerly 97 work from the Dark Days album, but i found it to be inspiring and haunting!<br />The Bonus audio cd is as great as the concert footage, if your a Gary fan and a lover of Guitar music, this is a MUST HAVE!<br />Rock in Peace Sir Gary! :)
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer is one of the most prolific songwriters, guitarists and performers to have been born in the last 35 years.  His latest album, Born and Raised proves why this isn't an unsubstantiated claim and how his triple-threat talents have given his career such sustainability.<br /><br />It's also a \\"different\\" kind of album from Mayer though it's not an unexpected one.  Simple. At times southern rock and at time folksy, it's at all times the melodic, lyrical genius that is Mayer's trademark.<br /><br />Brilliantly produced by the legendary Don Was (the Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt, B.B. King, Mitch Ryder), this album can be listened to in any environment, for any mood, at any time.  This is because of - not only Mayer's songwriting and performing skills - but for the great people he selected in helping him play on Born and Raised.<br /><br />On keys is the legendary keyboardist and Boomerocity friend, Chuck Leavell (Chuck discusses Born and Raised with Boomerocity here); much sought-after drummer, Aaron Sterling; and, on bass, is Sean Hurley who, appropriately enough for this album, formerly toured with Arlo Guthrie.<br /><br />Three randomly picked favorites (because I love all the songs from Born and Raised) are:<br /><br />Speak for Me is one of those songs whose lyrics make you think if not haunt you.  \\" . . . and the music on my radio ain't supposed to make me feel alone . . . You can tell that something isn't right when all your heroes are in black and white . . . what a drag to say `At least I still have yesterday . . .\\"<br /><br />Second choice is the introspective, lonely title song.  While Mayer has obviously written this song in his thirties, the meaning is ageless and the appeal not bound by generations.  This is a brilliant, brilliant song that is surely destined to be one of Mayer fans' favorites.<br /><br />The final randomly picked favorite is the mellow, contemplative If I Ever Get Around to Living. Lyrically and melodically captivating, Mayer says, \\"If I ever get around to living, It's gonna be just like a I dreamed. I'm gonna take the love I'm given and set it free . . .\\".<br /><br />John Mayer fans like me have already bought this CD without needing to listen to it first.  For those looking for an introductory CD of what Mayer is like, you can't go wrong with Born and Raised.  Be warned, though, that you'll need to be prepared to buy his other work to explore other areas of this artist's work.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com\\"If I ever get around to living, It's gonna be just like a I dreamed.

B0085KGHI6|5.0|On a cold Chicago winter night, November 22, 1981, the Rolling Stones were in the midst of their huge Tattoo You tour and had a night off.  Hearing that the legendary Muddy Waters was playing a gig at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Lounge, they decided to catch one of their blues idols act.  Before the night was over, Muddy had summoned Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Ian Stewart to the stage for a night of jamming to some blues classics.<br /><br />Fortunately for those of us who were not fortunate enough to catch that historical performance, it was caught on camera and is now made available to us on DVD and CD to watch and listen to as we wish - and we'll all wish to watch and listen to it a lot.<br /><br />The package includes 16 tracks on the DVD, eleven of which are featured on the CD.  Featured on both are classics like Baby Please Don't Go (a Boomerocity favorite),  Hoochie Coochie Man, and Clouds in My Heart.  The entire collection is blues - historic blues - as it should be played.  The icing on the cake is hearing it played by the likes of Muddy, Keith, Ronnie, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy.  Add Sir Mick to the mix on vocals and, Wow! History is taking place right before your very eyes and ears.<br /><br />This collection is a must-have for any serious music fan or musicologist since a line of this magnitude is rarely caught on film for posterity.  Order it today and pick up a couple of extra copies in order to get some very early Christmas shopping done for the music nut on your shopping list.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com

B007XNAQPG|5.0|In December of last year - following the incredibly successful All You Need is Now UK arena tour, Duran Duran filmed and recorded their show at the MEN Arena in Manchester, England.  The result is Duran Duran Live in Concert 2011 - A Diamond in the Mind and will definitely be an audio - as well as visual - delight to Duran Duran fans the world over.<br /><br />Directed and filmed in high definition by the band's long-time collaborator, Gavin Elder, Diamond will be the band's first live release in close to ten years. The line-up includes Simon Le Bon, John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Nick Rhodes.  While Andy Taylor isn't part of the band's arsenal of musical weaponry, Dom Brown does a phenomenal job with his more than capable talents on the guitar.<br /><br />Fans will definitely want to pick up both the DVD/Blu-ray as well as the CD because each offers something that the other doesn't.  Boomerocity has gone to the trouble of detailing those differences for you.  They are:<br /><br />The CD has Come Undone that is not included on the DVD.<br /><br />Not included on the CD but is on the DVD are: Return to Now, Safe in the Heat of the Moment, The Man Who Stole a Leopard, Careless Memories, A Diamond in the Mind.<br /><br />The randomly selected Boomerocity favorites from this collection are:<br /><br />Before the Rain is a tune from the band's latest album, All You Need Is Now, that came out in the spring of last year to much critical acclaim.  Different from a Duran Duran point of view, it's quite a moving song as well as quite the crowd pleaser.<br /><br />The uber cool, A View to a Kill, reminds me of watching the band perform this tune (if my memory serves me correctly) during a Grammy ceremony.  Regardless of where I saw the performance, the tune is still the only theme song from a James Bond movie to ever reach number one in the charts and this performance of the song is a great example of what that is the case.<br /><br />Finally, Ordinary World is performed as beautifully and effortlessly as the original studio recording which is as much a testament to the band (especially Brown's solo!) as it is to Le Bon's still-stellar vocal quality. This one tune alone is worth the price of the entire package. Trust me on this one.<br /><br />Duran Duran Live 2011 - A Diamond in the Mind is a great DVD and CD package to have in anyone's CD as well as DVD library.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Eagle member, rock and roll icon and all around ordinary guy, Joe Walsh, has released his tenth solo album, Analog Man.  As has been touted in reviews and press around the world, the long awaited album is the Kansas native's first solo release in twenty years and was ten years in the making.<br /><br />Boomerocity feels that it has been well worth the wait.<br /><br />Analog Man is a reflection of a man who has been through the fires of life, has lived to tell about it and is happy and content in his own skin and where he currently is in life - even being an analog man in a digital world.<br /><br />With nothing to prove, nothing to lose but plenty to share from his heart, Walsh shares songs that are introspective and prime for live performances which will make the album stand as a classic for many years to come.<br /><br />Before the Boomerocity view of this great album is shared, a comment must be made about some of the other reviews that are floating around out there.  Some criticism has been leveled at Jeff Lynne and his production and playing efforts and their impact on the album.  These people may very well be qualified to make such criticisms.  I don't know. I know that I am not so qualified and that I love the album.<br /><br />However, what I will say is that these people are obviously missing the point of Analog Man which, in my opinion, is that Walsh wishes to share the lessons he's learned, the observations he's made and the gratitude he has from a life that is extremely blessed.<br /><br />To those points, Boomerocity would like to highlight a few of the ten tunes that grace the album.  The first being the title cut.  With words like, \\"The whole world's glued to the cable TV, it looks so real on the big LCD. Murder and violence are rated PG, too bad for the children - they are what they see . . .\\", Joe sites a sad indictment and the societal regression we try to label as progress.  The man calls it as he sees it in his own witty way that we've all loved for all these many years.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball  is Walsh's attempt at waving off the current generation of entertainers who are living their life on the self-destructive edge, tempting fate and eternity.  He observes, \\"You're at the table, it's the same old game, double up the bet, you keep hoping that your luck will change, hasn't happened yet\\".<br /><br />A couple of songs later, Joe tells his own story of waste and redemption from alcohol and drugs in One Day at a Time by saying, \\"Well, you know, I was always the first to arrive at the party and the last to leave the scene of the crime. Well, it started with a couple of beers and it went I don't know how many years, like a run-way train headed for the end of the line.\\"<br /><br />Other great songs like Family, Lucky That Way and Band Played On (with a little help from his brother-in-law, Ringo Starr), are sure to create many a pleasurable earworm to the listener.  However, I believe that the fan and crowd favorite of this entire CD will be Funk 50 - an obvious  sequel to Walsh's hit with the James Gang, Funk 49.  This song alone is worth the price of the entire disc.<br /><br />Analog Man is definitely one of the best albums one can add to their listening library this year.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comitty way that we've all loved for all these many years.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball  is Walsh's attempt at waving off the current generation of entertainers who are living their life on the self-destructive edge, tempting fate and eternity.

However, they will be thrilled to learn that the Grammy Award winning film has been fully restored remastered and is now being made available in DVD and Blu-ray. Filmed in Modena, Italy during a two night stop in November 1993 during the Secret World Live tour in support of the \\"Us\\" album, the show is elaborately presented and choreographed in ways that you can only expect from a Peter Gabriel production.<br /><br />Backing Gabriel on the film is David Rhodes on guitar, Tony Levin on bass,  Jean Claude Naimro on keyboards and vocals, Manu Katche on drums, the lovely Paula Cole assisting on vocals, Shankar on violin and vocals), Levon Minassian on the doudouk and guests Papa Wemba and Molokai.  Together, they punch out some of Gabriel's best work up to that point, including Boomerocity favorites Steam, Sledgehammer and Secret World, as well as Don't Give Up, In Your Eyes, Digging In The Dirt, and Shaking The Tree, along with nine other great tunes..<br /><br />There's also a ton of bonus features that are included.

B000SEGMBO|5.0|This book is a game changer, for me personally.  For example, coming off of some recent Java development, manual memory management seems like a correctness/maintenance nightmare, especially when dynamic allocation must be used outside of a constructor, and various errors and exceptions can lead to partially initialized states.  Effective C++ introduces \\"smart pointers\\" and RAII concepts, which effectively (and non-obstrusively!) resolve these issues.<br /><br />Of course, this book contains much more than just smart pointers and RAII.  It is dense with \\"oh snap!\\" and \\"twist!\\" moments, when some lesser-known or edge case C++ behavior is revealed.  It also introduces you to various other relatively new features of C++ that are already available to you through Boost.  The majority of the book is directly applicable to everyday C++ development, with a few sections devoted to topics which you can skip/skim if you do not immediately need them.<br /><br />Sections you can safely skip:<br />1) Parts of Chapter 7: Templates and Generic Programming, especially the sections on traits and template metaprogramming.<br />2) Chapter 8: Customizing new and delete.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did, and use it to quickly become an expert, or at least advanced, C++ developer.  My last warning to you is that the companion book, [[ASIN:020163371X More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs]], is 9 years older than this book, and as such is not nearly as relevant.  Some of the content, for example that related to compiler implementations and performance of various C++ constructs, should probably be viewed with suspicion.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Shape Shifter is Carlos Santana's first studio album since his 2010 release, Guitar Heaven, and it's been well worth the wait!  I don't know what else to say but that I love every note of every song on this album. I really, sincerely do.<br /><br />Listening to this CD and it is one of those albums that is just pure, blissful joy to listen to.  It's soothing. It's romantic. It's exhilarating. I know I'm repeating myself but it is  blissful joy to listen to.<br /><br />If a gun was held to my head and was told to pick three favorites off of this album, I'd be tempted to say just shoot me.  Then, I'd get my proper senses about me, close my eyes and let my finger randomly pick three tunes - which is exactly what I've done.<br /><br />Angelica Faith has blown me away each of the infinite number of times I've listened to this incredibly beautiful tune.  You can sleep to it. You can relax to it. You can work to it and read to it. It's beautiful. It then smoothly and effortlessly near-segues into Never the Same Again, complementing the same vibe and, then again, right into In the Light of Day.  Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Some may disagree with this statement but I will be so bold as to say that Shape Shifter is one of Carlos Santana's best three albums.  Purchase it and see if I'm telling the truth.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
0425263908|5.0|I have never written a review before this.. I had to.. I read 50 Shades of Grey and loved it! I think I liked this even more! I admit, in the beginning I was thinking what the other reviews said.. Its a complete knock off of 50 and the plot was the same.. but as it went on.. it got better.. There are alot of similarities, but this is different in many of ways. I bought this book at 10 p.m. last night and by 2 a.m. I was 75% through it. I dont want to stop reading this book!
B007XNAQ6A|5.0|In December of last year - following the incredibly successful All You Need is Now UK arena tour, Duran Duran filmed and recorded their show at the MEN Arena in Manchester, England.  The result is Duran Duran Live in Concert 2011 - A Diamond in the Mind and will definitely be an audio - as well as visual - delight to Duran Duran fans the world over.<br /><br />Directed and filmed in high definition by the band's long-time collaborator, Gavin Elder, Diamond will be the band's first live release in close to ten years. The line-up includes Simon Le Bon, John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Nick Rhodes.  While Andy Taylor isn't part of the band's arsenal of musical weaponry, Dom Brown does a phenomenal job with his more than capable talents on the guitar.<br /><br />Fans will definitely want to pick up both the DVD/Blu-ray as well as the CD because each offers something that the other doesn't.  Boomerocity has gone to the trouble of detailing those differences for you.  They are:<br /><br />The CD has Come Undone that is not included on the DVD.<br /><br />Not included on the CD but is on the DVD are: Return to Now, Safe in the Heat of the Moment, The Man Who Stole a Leopard, Careless Memories, A Diamond in the Mind.<br /><br />The randomly selected Boomerocity favorites from this collection are:<br /><br />Before the Rain is a tune from the band's latest album, All You Need Is Now, that came out in the spring of last year to much critical acclaim.  Different from a Duran Duran point of view, it's quite a moving song as well as quite the crowd pleaser.<br /><br />The uber cool, A View to a Kill, reminds me of watching the band perform this tune (if my memory serves me correctly) during a Grammy ceremony.  Regardless of where I saw the performance, the tune is still the only theme song from a James Bond movie to ever reach number one in the charts and this performance of the song is a great example of what that is the case.<br /><br />Finally, Ordinary World is performed as beautifully and effortlessly as the original studio recording which is as much a testament to the band (especially Brown's solo!) as it is to Le Bon's still-stellar vocal quality. This one tune alone is worth the price of the entire package. Trust me on this one.<br /><br />Duran Duran Live 2011 - A Diamond in the Mind is a great DVD and CD package to have in anyone's CD as well as DVD library.  They're both very much worth the investment.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comutifully and effortlessly as the original studio recording which is as much a testament to the band (especially Brown's solo!) as it is to Le Bon's still-stellar vocal quality.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Their fifth album in twelve years, Living Things just may be Linkin Park's best CD yet.  The band has matured in both their sound and their creativity which will, no doubt, translate well into their live performances.<br /><br />Produced by Rick Rubin and Mike Shinoda, the results are nothing less than remarkable.  Tight. Layered. Intricate.  This CD reveals something of itself with each and every listen.<br /><br />Right out of the chute, the album starts with Lost in the Echo. Boomerocity predicts that this tune will be a crowd pleasure with the band's fans during the current tour.  I always measure Chester Bennington's vocals by how scared they make me and my reluctance level about going to bed.  Let's just say that I had to change the sheets . . . twice.  How does he do that with his voice?<br /><br />Another predicted favorite is the bone-chilling I'll Be Gone.  I don't know what the intended theme of this tune is for sure but, from where I sit, it strikes me as being words of someone dying - possibly even someone committing suicide.  If it's either, I'd like to think it's the former and not the latter.  Beautifully written and performed with passion and conviction, this is at the top of the Boomerocity favorites from this album.<br /><br />Victimized is a short tune that sounds like either powerful protest against our government and the messes it has gotten this country into or a very angry break-up song.  Because of the segue into the very gentle Roads, I would say that it's a break-up song and that the lyrics to Roads Untraveled are some of the most poignant I've heard in years Untraveled (\\"Give up your heart left broken, And let that mistake pass on, `Cause the love that you lost, Wasn't worth what it cost, And in time you'll be glad it's gone\\").<br /><br />Linkin Park fans are going to eat this album up and love every musical morsel of it.  People not familiar with Linkin Park would do well to make this album their first purchase of the bands work.  They'll be hooked for life and quickly buy the other five albums.<br /><br />Boomerocity.coml be hooked for life and quickly buy the other five albums.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Jurassic Park itself has made a mark as one of the greatest cinematic movies of all time.<br /><br />JP III: ... no comment...<br />JP Lost World: The T-Rex running loose in the streets of California.<br />JP: So many memories but the best moment in my opinion of the whole series and my personal favorite movie scene of all time the brontosaurs scene.<br /><br />However here is the problem with the blu ray the brontosaurs looks as if it was animated for a direct movie for the syfy channel.<br /><br />That is my only complaint about Jurassic park on blu ray i purchased the dvd trilogy for my brother and the brontosaurs looks very realistic.<br /><br />This is my only complaint but if the brontosaurs isn't your favorite scene from the series then by all means purchase  the blu ray you will not be dissapointed. The blu ray is a great purchase i was just upset over that scene but if you are like me and that scene is your personal favorite of the series the dvd is the best way to go.

B003BD236C|5.0|Great movie and ahead of it's time for the early 60's. It is interesting to note that<br />this movie first came out in early 1964 which was just after JFK was assassinated in<br />November 22, 1963. (I was only 10 at the time.)<br />This movie has some really old time actors in it that you may recognize in later TV series<br />and movies.<br />This is one of the best thrillers and \\"cliff hangers\\" you will ever want to see and buy.<br />I highly recommend it today as it still applies to world situations even today.<br />The technology is different, but Hollywood makes things even more impressive than the real<br />thing some times. I know, cause I worked inside the White House and was in the U.S. Secret<br />Service at the age of 21 and some of the procedures you see in this movie are still true today.<br />Great movie, I highly recommend it to everyone who is concerned about the responsibilities of<br />the President and others during a nuclear crisis.<br />Makes you think twice about who you elect to the Office Of The President next time.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|This stylus is UNBELIEVABLE!    The brief summary would be that it does 2 major things completely different from any other stylus I have used. It's comfortable and it glides effortlessly across the tablet.    1. Writing experience - Writing with the Cosmonaut is unlike any other stylus. (I have used 3 other styli by big name branded companies)  My experience with those previous devices was a kin to 'dragging' the stylus across the screen or 'pushing' it up the screen. This cosmonaut just glides. There is no friction in changing direction so it makes handwriting very easy. Messing around in skitch, I wrote my signature super quick and it actually looked better than my pen\paper signature.    2. Size & feel - The cosmonaut fits nicely in my hand... it is sort of like a whiteboard marker but the material is softer and 'grippier', unlike the plastic marker so I don't have to squeeze it as tough as a whiteboard marker.    With the combination of 1 & 2, I don't have to anchor my palm on the tablet to write or draw. And I don't have to hold it super low like a pen, so I have had ZERO accidental hand registers.    I have to say that I am absolutely impressed with this product and extremely satisfied with my purchase.    and if you read this long, here is some extra subjective bonus review:  I also really like their website [...] and how they helped me 'get to know' them and their product before I bought it. I like the ingenuity and attitude of the company and the helps me appreciate the product even more.
030758836X|5.0|This was, by far, one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  Just when you think you know what's going on, it changes.  Then, when you think you know what's going on, it changes again!  I loved it and am recommending it to everyone!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is a really fun game. i could play it for a long time and still not be tired of it. (:
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This was an interesting little read. It seems pretty obvious that these two young psychos are doomed. This is no soft, fuzzy love story; these two kids have a relationship so dysfunctional that even George and Martha would have been right in asking them to take it down a notch. In five years - if they last that long - these two young lovers will either be dead, in jail, or regulars on the TV show COPS.<br /><br />I read the one-star reviews before reading this book, and most of them are negative because they hate Travis. They are right in hating Travis. *I* hate Travis. He is a violent, hot-tempered alcoholic. He is not charming. He is not cute. When Abby refuses to fall for him, I read on, knowing that she inevitably will give in, and as a reader seeing through her eyes, I will fall for him too.  It was a fascinating journey through her thought process.<br /><br />The best part: Abby's backstory was interesting to me, she seems to have more of a personality than the usual bland heroines in stories like this. People love to bag on the bizarre Vegas twist, but I have to admit I found it entertaining.<br /><br />The worst part: There is a lot that is bad.<br /><br />1)The editing is atrocious. Typos, bad punctuation, and unintelligible sentences pepper this book. There is one memorable swath of writing that repeats itself in two different places, and it is obviously an editing oversight.<br />2)It's a minor quibble, but the character names are all REALLY stupid.<br />3)Descriptions are really lacking. Other than tattoos and brown eyes, I have no idea what Travis looks like. Heck, it wasn't until the end of the book that there is a mention of his shaved head. Wait, he had a shaved head the whole time? And what does Abby look like? I understand that some authors are intentionally vague, leaving these details to one's imagination, but it bugged me.<br />4)The social dynamics of the campus are completely wrong. In college, there is no such thing as a rumor mill. People don't sit in the cafeteria with their lunch trays. There isn't the jock-nerd-whatever separation. No one cares who is sleeping with who. It is ridiculous. If this were a high school story, then I could buy it. But that is not how college life works.<br /><br />There are lots of other quibbles (The Diamond bracelet. America's character inconsistencies. The lack of any adults. The constant slut-shaming. The fact that the Maddox men can't have Thanksgiving unless a WOMAN MAKES IT FOR THEM. (WTF))<br /><br />Despite all that is bad about this book, and there is a LOT of bad, I just couldn't put it down. I rode the crazy train all the way to the end, and because of that, I still need to rate it highly. As long as you know what you are in for before you begin, you may enjoy this. The title of this book is apt; these two lovers really are a beautiful disaster.
0440244412|5.0|I didn't think any book in the fever series could be as good as Dreamfever, but this one was. So heart wrenching. Mac goes to a very dark place. This book has some of the best writing I've ever read. Full of suspense, drama , sex and lust and seduction. Makes your toes curl. I was frustrated in some parts with Mac especially after Barron's return. Hard headed, both of them. Great characters all the way around. The showdown with Darroc wasn't as hands on as I would have liked but it was still gruesome. I would have liked to have seen him tortured a little. Most questions were answered and if they weren't then Jerricho dictated why.  The very ending is the only thing that got me. I just couldn't picture Barron's doing what he was doing wether he liked it or not. Great book and series. Lots of cliffhangers from one book to the other. Very satisfied with the final book in this series. Some other series should have ended many many books ago...it would have been sad to have Mackaylas character be uninteresting.<br />Love it\\".........
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I guess this was supposed to be a philosophical action movie, and it fails on both points. unless of course you seek to gain wisdom of spirituality from foul-mouthed Alaskan oilmen being ridiculously hunted by wolves skip it. I love Liam Neeson and had hoped for something akin to his other films, nope. Not even LN could save this silly plot and preachy pontificating on God. The only real question to my mind is which is more ridiculous, the overused scene of a desperate man screaming to the sky for a miracle or the idea that wolves would maliciously seek revenge on humans. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
034580404X|5.0|Well,what can I say? My husband bought me this box set after hearing me talk about how everyone was reading it and talking about how good it was. I have read 50 Shades of Grey vol.1 and have started on 50 Shades Darker vol.2. The first book was not what I was expecting. That is not a bad thing though. I am used to reading historicl romances, so this was new for me. Needless to say, I was blown away. The author really captures the characters' emotions. Whether they are happy, sad, mad, or sexual, her use of words, punctuation, grammer, etc. makes it where you feel as though you have been whisked into the story yourself. She is truly gifted and really knows how to describe the love making scenes in such vibrant detail and energetic enthusiasm. Just ask my husband. lol...I have had to put the book down for a little while and spend some \\"quality\\" time with him. (if you know what I mean)  This book really will help your sex life if it is lacking in some areas. Mine has spiked through the roof...Now if I could just get my hubby to read it.....just kidding.....KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK E.L.JAMES!!!!![[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]

B008OBPGQK|3.0|METEORA LIVE AROUND THE WORLD collects songs from the band's recent tours that originally appeared on sophomore album METEORA.<br /><br />First, I would like to state that I really enjoyed Linkin Park's [[ASIN:B001ERMYCA METEORA]] when it came out, and I enjoy it now almost a decade later. It's an incredibly consistent album; it's slick, polished, and enjoyable. It was an excellent follow-up to the band's debut album.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this isn't represented in METEORA LIVE AROUND THE WORLD. This live album only collects 7 of the songs that originally appeared on the album.  That's right, only 7 of the 13 appear here.  Even if you don't count \\"Foreward\\" towards the total run time, only 7 of the original 12 tracks are represented here.  Almost half of the album is missing.  The songs that didn't make the cut: \\"Hit the Floor,\\" \\"Easier to Run,\\" \\"Figure.09,\\" \\"Nobody's Listening,\\" \\"Session,\\" and \\"Foreword.\\"<br /><br />Aside from the conspicuously missing tracks is the poor sound quality.  I understand that these songs were culled from different venues, in front of different audiences, etc..., but this mastering doesn't do the band justice.  Many of these songs are represented in Linkin Park's [[ASIN:B00122BECS LIVE IN TEXAS]] with much better sound quality.  Even the performance of a few songs don't live up to the band's reputation: \\"Breaking the Habit\\" and \\"Faint\\" give listeners of a band that sounds quite tired and exhausted.<br /><br />EDIT: Amazon has raised the price of this compilation from 99 cents to $9.99.  I find this hard to recommend to anyone given this price point.<br /><br />There are a few nice things about this collection: these songs still sound great live, even though the recording isn't great.  Additionally, the album is modestly priced (only 99 cents!?) and for that price, this collection is certainly worth the price of admission.<br /><br />So who is this for? I would recommend this collection to casual fans of the band; there's nothing here that hardcore fans of Linkin Park haven't heard before already. It's hard not to recommend because of its price point, but it's hard to recommend due to its poor quality and exclusion of original songs.  At best, METEORA LIVE AROUND THE WORLD serves as a good sampler for the original album.<br /><br />EDIT: Amazon has raised the price of this compilation from 99 cents to almost 7 bucks.

0062206281|3.0|3.5 stars. Prisoner of Heaven, like Carlos Ruiz Zafon's other books is engaging, witty and mysterious.  It is also confusing and contradicts the ending of Angel's Game, the prequel to Prisoner of Heaven.  I am torn to chalking it up to forgetfulness on my part, or deliberate intent to cause the reader to re-read the previous books.  It does lack a cohesive ending, which (hopefully) indicates a final book that will tie them all together.  Fermin is delightful as always, and fills any void that the story may have.  A good read, but I was left wanting more.
0345803493|4.0|As you know this is the second in a trilogy, so I felt it was not as much of a fast read as the first book,  still interesting and \\"fun\\"
B000002MIY|5.0|From the start Donald Fagen has always been a very smart man. Most of the creative decisions he made in Steely Dan tended to be the correct ones,as much of a perfectionist as he tended to be. Likely that was part of it. After his enormously successful solo debut [[ASIN:B000002KXV The Nightfly]],very much an extension on Steely Dan there was a decade long gap between albums. And when this finally emerged it was very much a Steely Dan album in all but name,featuring production and playing from Walter Becker. Something more interesting was going on though. Part of the appeal of Steely Dan,in terms of their lyrics,was their devotion to very implicit (sometimes cryptic) uses of language. You didn't always know exactly what they were talking about. Sometimes you got the impression you didn't want to. This came along at a time where most popular music of the time was stating things in highly explicit ways. You'd think Donald Fagan would have trouble surviving in this environment of harsh music and lyrics. Actually he turned that very much to his advantage.<br /><br />  For starters the focus of this sophmore solo set is the flip of the first one. Where on that he was looking back upon his youth,here he was looking forward on middle aged. And considering we're talking about one of the most perceptive modern songwriters this side of Joe Jackson,he's got plenty of stories to tell. He's very much the observer on \\"Trans-Island Skyway\\",\\"Countermoon\\" and \\"Springtime\\" that open the album. These are grinding funk jams with some JB like guitar licks and breaks but with this ultra clean production and elaborate pop tunesmithing he was known for. The somewhat slower \\"Snowbound\\" has a lovely sound even as it deals with a midlife crisis. \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" is very much [[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]] period Steely Dan all the way,with this hilariously witty lyric comparing the new generation of women to Stepford Wife-like B-movie body snatchers. \\"Florida Room\\" is one of my favorites on this album full of them for me,a swinging uptempo jazz funk number with an extremely catchy melody and a sassy theme. The near 9 minute \\"On The Dunes\\" is a beautiful jazzy ballad with some wonderful piano chords and a very reflective,if sometimes sad take on going up time and the river as it were.<br /><br />  The album ends with another great mixture of jazz and funk on \\"Teahouse On The Tracks\\". In the end this is one of the finest albums to come out of the Steely Dan musical cannon. Donald Fagen was extremely lucky in that regard. His first two solo records,though released a decade apart were absolute musical triumphs. And both were tremendously successful as well. After being let down so massively by the pop culture changed in 1991-92 hearing \\"Tomorrows Girl\\" on new music pop stations was an absolute delight to these ears. It would be under a decade when Steely Dan finally did re-emerge with a new album [[ASIN:B00004GOXS Two Against Nature]] and take home their first ever Grammy for album of the year. I am of the opinion that if pop music had gone for the type of approach that Steely Dan and people like them had,people could turn on the radio and be able to sing,hum and dance along to music happily that would give them something to think about in the end up. This is music that will make you dance along,hum along,feel happy,sad and creative all at the same time.

0547569653|5.0|I have to say, that I didn't know who Scott was, but started to read his book because my husband was excited about reading it. Anyway, I finished reading it in a few days. After I read it,  I was so excited to hear that he was coming to our local running  store. I got to read a great book and meet a great person. Thanks Scott for being such a great inspiration.
034544678X|5.0|I read it cover to cover and then back again to re read sections. It is full of good information for expanding perceptions of dog behaviors. It is not a step by step training manual. It is a sharing of knowledge from a very learned author.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The plot is very well crafted, hangs together very well and obvious care was taken to keep it consistent. The main characters are very engaging and well developed.  The pacing is also very good making it a very easy and enjoyable read.  My only criticisms are that the characters don't seem to have their own voice.  In Mark Twain's writing (for example) you know who is speaking based on how they use language.  Making different characters' use of language more distinct would improve the work.  That's a pretty minor niggle, however.  A friend of mine loaned it to me, but after I read it I had to buy it since I will almost definitely be reading it again, but not in the next week. :)
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I tried REALLY hard to like this book. I was disappointed. The main character Abby's indecisiveness, drama, and perceived game-playing with Travis, just drove me nuts. MANY times  wanted to just forget it and quit reading. I usually love romance type novels, but felt that this was just a mess and it was hard for me to finish it. I hate to leave a negative review, as this author has alot of fans, but the dialogue was all over the place and I felt like I was trapped in a teenage journal that I couldnt escape from, for over 400 pages.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry grabs you from start to finish, being English myself and familiar with most of the places on his journey certainly made it more real to me, BUT, it's not just the journey it's the interaction with the people he meets along the way that makes him so human with all the foibles we all have, You start out feeling sorry for Maureen his wife, but by the end you just like her and the sadness of her life becomes her strength.<br /><br />Some parts of the story are predictable while at the same time it keeps you guessing,  For me it's always important to really like the characters, and this book is full of vey likable people, you cheer for the good guys and hiss and boo the not so nice ones,<br /><br />It's a journey I think a lot of us would like to take, totally spontaneous without a thought in the head except to make the journey and arrive at it's destination, maybe not for the same reasons as Harold, this was for me a can't put down book,  sometimes I get tempted to read the end of a book, not this time, I wanted to work through the journey with him and reach the outcome.  A lovely human story with happy, glad, sad and a whole other myriad of emotion, the best book I've read i an age.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|Has Matt Damon given up the Bourne movies? He excelled as Jason Bourne and is a hard act to follow. Bourne Legacy is less of a sequel, and more of a spin off.<br /><br />Certainly elements of it work very well. Jeremy Renner brings his own brand of intensity to the role, and I like Rachel Weisz as the doctor with whom he goes on the run. I loved the way the scene in her house unfolded with all its twists and turns.<br /><br />Renner plays a character not named Bourne, but a former soldier named Aaron Cross. Unlike Bourne he remembers everything but seems to be unaware that he was part of a sinister experiment testing for biological weaponry, and he constantly needs medication or something bad will happen.<br /><br />It's several years later. Treadstone has become an embarrassment, requiring clean up before it gets even more embarrassing.<br /><br />In covert parlance cleanup means kill. He has been part of a biological warfare experiment though he seems unaware of this, and has to take certain medication. He does have mad lethal skills like Bourne, and he is extremely resourceful. So he becomes the loose end that fights back.<br /><br />Edward Norton brings his A game as the spook on his trail, giving an outstanding performance and the array of technology at his disposal is impressive.<br /><br />Matt Damon's Bourne movies are a hard act to follow, nevertheless Bourne Legacy does have its moments. I liked the fact that the answer to the problem lay in the Phillipines, and Cross is resourceful enough to fake a passport with new identities while both he and the doctor are being searched for at the highest levels, and the impressive technology being used to catch them is actually pretty scary. I also found the drone sequences in the wilderness very engaging.<br /><br />Can they really do all this?<br /><br />I particularly liked the action sequences particularly the motorbike chase scene in the Philippines, and how the doctor initially lacking any defense skills before she meets Cross, now gets some aggression and contributes realistically to a memorable action sequence, while will probably be the strongest memory I take from this movie.<br /><br />If you are a Bourne fan, and seen all the movies, your reaction might be similar to mine, I found it a worthwhile experience, and I think that most people having enjoyed the previous Bourne movies will enjoy this too. I hope this was helpful.she meets Cross, now gets some aggression and contributes realistically to a memorable action sequence, while will probably be the strongest memory I take from this movie.<br /><br />If you are a Bourne fan, and seen all the movies, your reaction might be similar to mine, I found it a worthwhile experience, and I think that most people having enjoyed the previous Bourne movies will enjoy this too.

B00275EGWY|5.0|I'm late in seeing this film, I know. There's prob not much to add that hasn't already been said. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but THE HURT LOCKER is most certainly perhaps the most intense and frightening film about today's wars that has yet been made. For those of you have watched this film and 'liked' it (can you 'like' something this horrifying?), I strongly recommend you read Brian Castner's [[ASIN:0385536208 The Long Walk: A Story of War and the Life That Follows]], one USAF EOD officer's memoir of the real thing and how it affected him and his family in his post-service civilian life. Like this film (which richly deserves the awards it won), you won't forget Castner's story for a long time. Kudos to the makers of THE HURT LOCKER and all who were part of it.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the Cold War memoir, SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA

B000002MVT|1.0|This is a compilation of tracks from ZZ Top's first 7 albums.  BEWARE! These are the REMIXED versions with added reverb, etc. that first appeared in the '80s.  They are NOT the \\"Original LP Versions\\" as claimed in the track list.  Listen to the track samples to confirm this.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I got a chance to see all four broadcasts of this legendary opera cycle in its new Met Production at my local theater and what a delight it was. While I am not classically trained in music or technically proficient, I do have eyes and ears, and truly appreciated and was awe-struck by the marvel of the theatrical experience on display. I have been eagerly anticipating the home viewing premiere of this performance and now it is here. The consistency in casting, conducting, and sets and costumes, lighting and photography are all stellar. And, of course the music, Wagner's most inspired and grandest creation. I've seen most of the Rings available on video, and this one goes right to the top of the list. Included is the wonderful full length documentary on the making of this astonishing new production 'Wagner's Dream' by Susan Froemke. You don't even have to like opera or Wagner to appreciate this included film, but if you're like me, and love this new production, 'Wagner's Dream' will be a pleasure cruise. 5 stars!!!
B005J29HCQ|4.0|I bought this album several months ago, and the first impression is that of an album which tries almost too hard to be creative. Numerous songs which begin with promising themes are interrupted with often jarring \\"modules,\\" only to go back to the original theme, or seque into some other theme. It can be hard to tell where one song ends, and the next begins.<br /><br />But the complexity of the album also inspires one to keep listening to it. And the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. You literally have to listen to this album at least 10 times, and maybe even 15 or 20, in order to really appreciate it. That same rule applies to individual songs, particularly \\"Heroes and Villains.\\" I think I've listened to \\"Heroes and Villains\\" about 30 times now, and what I first thought was a disconcerting mash-up of semi-related themes that almost, but not quite, fit together, I now can't seem to get out of my head. Oddly, I still think the themes don't quite fit together as they should, but for some reason, that makes it all the more appealing.<br /><br />If this album had been released as planned in early 1967, I don't think it would have been a commercial success. Its complexity probably would have turned off all but the most dedicated and sophisticated listeners. However, it surely would have been an artistic success, and I've little doubt its reputation would have grown over time, similar to the path their previous album Pet Sounds took.
1451629184|5.0|I recommend this book ~ though there was limited mature reflections, I soon<br />realized that her education was stunted by these two horrible and disgusting<br />sub-human beings.  I applaude her great ability to stay sane and to move<br />on so well with her life now.<br /><br />Very hard to read and imagine what she went through but thankful for her<br />willingness to record/publish it. There's not a real hint of revenge from<br />her.  But I hope that these 2 criminals suffer daily for years and years.
B00005ASHM|4.0|I bought this album several years ago after having read that it was written in response to Rubber Soul (am a huge Beatles fan). More recently, having discovered SMiLE, I've started listening to this more, and come to appreciate it more. \\"God Only Knows\\" is clearly as masterpiece.<br /><br />There's not much I can add that others here haven't already said. I just want to add one thing I'm not sure anyone else has ever noticed (and it's not all to do with the Beach Boys):<br /><br />The Bangles song \\"Eternal Flame,\\" intentionally or not, seems to be a mixture of \\"God Only Knows\\" and the Beatles \\"Michelle.\\" Listen to all three, and you'll see why.<br /><br />Just had to get that out. :-/

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love SOA, I first discovered it early last year on netflix and got through the first 3 seasons in one month, I definitely was not disappointed with season 4 and am so stoked for season 5.  SOA is one of the best shows on television that I've seen in years, it's crafted so well, the writer/producer Kurt Sutter is a genius, he keeps you guessing and always throws you something your not ready for and gives you a lot of action.  You'd be crazy not to see the beauty of this show! :)
B00004OCQ2|5.0|There's little more to say in addition to other Five-star reviews.  The recording is a little rough, but that's the beauty of Dusk.  The listener will appreciate Badlands' incredible talent.  Too bad the group didn't last longer.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is the type of game that is perfect for someone who has about a spare 15 or 30 mintues a day. As others have said it does take a while for the energy to recharge, but given I was only able to play it for about 10 minutes at a time I was rarely bothered by it.<br /><br />At first this is an extremely fun game. But around level 25 it really loses any kind of &quot;quest development&quot; and you find yourself just building the same buildings over and over again for lack of a better thing to do.<br /><br />I also, as others have noted, ran into the glitching issue, even after multiple updates. I would shut down the app and come back hours later to find that none of my energy had recharged and the timers had reset to a 200+ hour wait time.<br /><br />I did not uninstall, but I rarely play due to the frustration.
B004LWZW9M|3.0|I saw New years Eve in the theatres and thought it was cute. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. I bought the bluray/dvd and ultraviolet combo because I was going to give the dvd to a friend because she loved the movie. Well I didn't notice when I ordered it but the bluray and dvd are on one disc. One side is blu/ray and the other is the dvd. I was a little annoyed at myself for not paying attention, because I could have just gotton the single bluray version cheaper by itself. I then started thinking that hey this is a cheap way to do a combo pack, but then I started to think that this was strange. Why if you have a bluray player would you need the dvd on the other side? You would play the bluray right? By the way there is a difference in how the picture looks when you look at both sides like I did. Who does the dvd side benefit? If you have a dvd player yeah you could play it, but it would be cheaper to buy the dvd version of the movie. A lot cheaper.
0785153322|4.0|After ordering The Marvel Phase 1 DVD set, Amazon popped up [[ASIN:0785162348 Avengers: The Art of Marvel's The Avengers]] as a recommendation. I don't usually buy art books, but I truly loved the film and wanted more of the Marvel experience. I loved it. It was a gorgeous, well-done book with brilliant photos and artwork, and a good bit of background information.  So, I decided to look for other Marvel art books. Thankfully, this was available for pre-order, so I didn't have to worry about missing out on the now out-of-print Iron Man books.  This set includes: The Art of Iron Man, the Art of Iron Man 2, The Art of Thor and the Art of Captain America.  All four hardcover books come in a slipcase, without dust jackets.  It also includes a limited edition poster of the slipcase cover art.  Please see my pictures of the actual set I received.<br /><br />THE ART OF IRON MAN.  I think this is easily the best book of the set (though none are as good as the Avengers book).  It goes seriously in depth into the design of the suit, including CGI modeling, testing the physics of how it would work, and more.  There is also a lot of attention spent on Tony's mansion and workshop.  The best part is how the book clearly shows the evolution of the film from the artists' renderings/designs, to models, to fully realized props.  There is a lot of concept design, but also many photos & screen shots to act as counterpoint to them.  The forward and background information on the character is brilliant, and Jon Favreau's enthusiasm for the character is noticeable.  My only minor criticism is that sometimes the text got too close to the spine and was difficult to read. 4.5 Stars.<br /><br />THE ART OF IRON MAN 2.  Despite a feeling of redundancy (the previous book already spent a huge amount of time on suit design), this book was also very good.  A good deal of it concerns the suits, of course, but the suitcase suit and War Machine provide enough new material that it doesn't feel like a retread.  The text was more important here as the editor made an effort to tie into the comics, and what was pulled from them in the development of the film.  I found the bits about Justin Hammer particularly interesting, since I didn't feel the character added much to the film.  This book spent more time on other character designs, since we have new ones like Black Widow and Nick Fury.  Overall, this was nearly as good as the art book for IM.  4 stars.<br /><br />THE ART OF THOR. I was most excited to see this art book, and ended up being hugely disappointed.  This was the weakest book in the set - by far.  Odd as it sounds, I think what was missing from this art book was more text.  There wasn't enough context for the artwork, and how and why it was used.  The first part of the book, the design of Thor himself, was fine.  There is a lot of concept art for how his costume could look, pictures of Chris Hemsworth through the creation phase, information on the design of Mjolnir, and more.  Still, there wasn't enough contrast vis a vis the comics.  And, much less time is spent on Loki (who has three different costumes to Thor's one), and why they made the choices they did for him.  There are many renderings of possible looks for him, but not why they chose some over others.  And, they never explain the need for three.  The other characters get uneven and much less than deserved coverage of their costume designs in favor of having pages, and pages, and pages and still more pages of over-enlarged, near-abstract landscapes for Jotunheim.  Yes, the ice planet.  How many ways can you depict ice? The book spent almost as much time on Jotunheim as on Asgard. And few of the paintings had much detail.  More time is spent on the frost giants than the Warriors 3 who have actual costumes and more screen time!  Readers get a few pages on the armory, which would have been very interesting with more information on the various weapons/artifacts within it (like the Infinity Gauntlet).  With the film taking place literally on another world, this art book should have been the best of the set.  I'm not sure if it was the artists on the film, or the editor, but it was a big letdown.  2.5 stars.<br /><br />THE ART OF CAPTAIN AMERICA.  This book is actually better than The Art of Iron Man because it doesn't have the issue with the text creeping into the spine. Otherwise, the two books each display a perfect balance of context, imagery and design.  Unlike Thor, this includes plenty of context and background information for the character, the design and how they drew inspiration from the comics.  Just about every character design is covered, from Cap and Red Skull, to Peggy, the Hydra soldiers, and the Howling Commandos.  The layout of the book is also exceptional.  Concept art is showcased against actual film shots, and the resolution is reflected in appropriately sized images.  Like in Iron Man, there are also a lot of weapon and vehicle designs included.  5 stars.<br /><br />All four books conclude with a section on storyboards, and a section on how they marketed each film, with emphasis on one-shot posters.  I would love to see a book devoted solely to the marketing for all the Marvel films, as these short chapters were very interesting and a great way to conclude each book. Overall, this set is definitely worth the purchase, and the price is reasonable considering each individual book had a retail of $50 without a slipcase.  For those reluctant to spend so much, a paperback set will be coming.  Highly recommended.th the film taking place literally on another world, this art book should have been the best of the set.

0618526412|4.0|In an enlightened world the future of young southern girl Mick Kelly should look as bright as her shining intellect and many talents.  Instead, a feeling of dread and foreboding seems to hang over her future and that of her motley group of friends that includes Blacks and Jews.  The deaf but refined Mr. Singer, a skilled Jewish engraver, whose best friend is an institutionalized and mentally-challenged Greek deaf-mute, is a special friend and beacon to young Mick--but his own life suffers under the constraints imposed by his disability.  A distinguished Black physician and his son also suffer greatly at the hands of a world that is alternately hostile and indifferent.  A kindly cafe owner mourns the passing of Mick's youth as she assumes the mantle of adulthood and her hum-drum job at the cheap Woolworths 5 and 10 cent store--while listening anxiously to radio reports of advancing Nazism in Europe.<br /><br />This book was first published in 1940.  Carson McCullers could never had guessed that these once poor Americans would staff the factories and armed forces that helped bury Fascism.

B000062XGD|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Cast Away\\" and starred Tom Hanks. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it was one of the best movies I've seen in at least the last decade. I've always liked camping. I guess it's just a little adventure in  that you're out in the open and don't really know what's going to happen. Plus, it's coping with natural conditions. Well, that's just a micro-adventure, of course. If you want to view a really stupendous adventure, give \\"Cast Away\\" a viewing.<br /><br />Tom Hanks played a globe-trotting, overly busy FedEx employee. He joined his fiance in Memphis at Christmas and promised to be back on New Year's Eve, after a quick trip to the Far East. Well, the FedEx plane went down somewhere in the Western Pacific. Hanks managed to escape and with a small inflatable raft made it to an unknown, apparently uninhabited island. His only possessions were that which he had on him and about a half-dozen FedEx packages which beached along with him plus a dead FedEx employee who was killed in the plane wreck and floated ashore. Well, it was immediately back to The Stone Age for Hanks with no food, no tools no shelter and few clothes. Of course, there were the FedEx packages, which had such useful items as a pair of figure skates, a volleyball and a big collection of VHS tapes. The skates became his only tool and the volleyball, with a face fashioned out of a blood smear, became his only companion He called the ball Wilson, after the brand name.<br /><br />The movie depicted Hanks' struggle to cope with his environment and find enough foodstuffs to survive. He ended up living on coconuts, small crustaceans and the few fish he could catch. Ultimately, he got a fire started, Boy Scout Style. This type of struggle went on for over four years and was just exceptionally well depicted. Ultimately, he built a raft out of wood scraps tied together mostly by vines and the VHS tapes. He managed to get it out beyond the surf zone with him then floating out in the open ocean where he was discovered, near death, by a freight liner almost 500 miles from his island origin, Then it was back to civilization. Everyone had given up on his survival. He had been given a funeral. They even buried a casket containing some of his belongings. His fiance was married and had about a three-year-old daughter.<br /><br />This was just a stunningly good movie. Essentially, it's a one-man show with just a bit of minor support at the beginning and end. There is no question in my mind that Hanks should have had the Best Actor Academy Award no matter what the competition was, His performance was just stunning. The direction and photography and everything about this film a\was just about perfect. Essentially, there was almost no action. It was just a one-man struggle against nature. There were no wild animals, not even birds. No disasters, other than the plane crash. No musical score to accompany the movie. None of the essentials, yet it was a stunningly good movie.<br /><br />Gary Petersonloating out in the open ocean where he was discovered, near death, by a freight liner almost 500 miles from his island origin, Then it was back to civilization.

0062059882|5.0|While I have read some of Neil Gaiman's work before, I was late to the game in reading American Gods.  It was to my advantage that I lucked into waiting, given the 10th Anniversary addition added in refinements and content worth waiting for.  As always the story is colorfully written with well developed characters and places.  Rather than spend time talking about the plot (which has been well covered in many of the other reviews) I want to address concerns that the book is too long and that it meanders.<br /><br />Indeed both charges ring true to me, in a manner of speaking.  The book is quite long, but the length is well worth a journey that you don't really want to see end.  And it does meander down a few paths, but all of the paths tie back to the main story.  Each road, out of the way detour, and dead end are all designed to add color and texture to a world that is overlaid on the America we know.  At some point,t his dream world of gods becomes somewhat mundane to the reader, and matter of fact.  I believe it is the size, and seeming randomness of the tale that allows this to happen.  American Gods is an experience, and that ultimately is why it is a modern classic.  You do not only read it, you also experience it, and start to relate to Shadow Moon.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|the lyric seems counter intuitive. but then so does the concept of Chris Robinson putting out something that easily stands up to BC. if this is the quality of stuff that CRB is going to continue to produce, then i really dont mind that the BC arent together.<br />since i was never a big fan of New Earth Mud i wasnt expecting too much from CBR and lamented that BC wasnt together. but as a fan of Little Feet, Dead and ABB i heard so much in this that i was thuroughly enjoying. from start to finish there are elements of ABB 'Dreams' or GD 'space>The Wheel' lead in or 'China Cat>Rider' bridge; and the keyboardist is obviously a fan of LF's Bill Payne.<br />the noodling never goes too far out of bounds where youre just waiting for the song to get back to a sense of cohesion (a reason i have trouble listening to live Phish).<br />and whats most important, i find EVERY song to be quite catchy and containing thoughtful lyrics.<br />at a risk of minimalizing it: while BC has been an incarnation of The Stones and Faces BCR is an incarnation of the early-mid 70's aforementioned groups with perhaps just a hint of Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here/Dark Side of The Moon era in there from time to time.<br />this is stellar for all the right reasons. cant find a negative thing to say about it.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Let me count the ways.  In this instance, we are not talking about love.  Characters are one dimentional, completely forgetably.  The entire story line of the book consists of two people moving from one sexual encounter to another, perhaps a teenage fantasy.  My concern would be that the novel, I use that term loosely, might make it seem acceptable to young women to go to any lengths to find \\"love\\". I'm voting with my wallet.  The trilogy ends with Book One for me.

B0019EXZXU|4.0|I initially watched this movie not realizing it was based on a real events - learning that made the film even better.  This film is full of action and keeps the viewers interest with no problem.  Plus Jason Statham is simply yummy in my opinion.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book sucked me in right away and didn't let go. I loved reading from the point of view of someone who hates the main character. I liked seeing both sides. Can't wait for the next book
034580404X|5.0|Ive read the entire trilogy and I absolutely loved them. They are fun, sexy, kinky, and in my opinion phycological! The demons Mr. Gray battles and the way Ana came as an angel to him is beautiful IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE SEX.<br />And to all the bad reviews well remember that this may not be your type of read, but the books are defiantly page turners for most of the people I know!

B008GXHOFW|1.0|I really regret getting this game. It worked fine when I first installed it, then all of a sudden the game restarts on its own. After that, I had to uninstall it due to numerous lock ups to my kindle, even after I had cleared a good amount of memory for the game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love the game it is a lot better than where's my water it works perfect on my kindle fire
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Jennifer Egan  has successfully woven the stories of 30 or so characters in several different chapters, each one with a particular style ranging from classic first person narratives to power-point presentations.<br />The book's central theme (passage of time) is touching on many levels and can be related to by readers of all sorts.<br />This book is not just good: it is a literary drug - I couldn't let go of it for a second!<br />Every single one of the central characters have such a human feel to them - this is definitely what made me love this book so much.<br />Do yourself a favor and treat yourself (or your giftee) with this wonderful book.

0385523394|3.0|Orange is the New Black grabbed my attention simply because I cannot imagine what it would be like to be in prison, with everything you do dictated by some higher power, living up-close-and-personal with a bunch of strangers, not knowing who your friends are, and only seeing your family and friends when someone else says it's OK.  Scary thoughts, right?<br /><br />The thing that I found most intriguing with Piper's story is the fact that she had several years between being sentenced and actually going to jail.  What must it feel like to have the spectre of prison time hanging over your head for so long?  I wish there had been some more focus on this aspect of her story - although she does explain how people reacted, I wanted to know more about how it affected her day to day life.  But perhaps, with several years intermission, she just got on with things as much as possible.<br /><br />With a large cast of characters, I did sometimes find myself a little confused as to who was who, and what their relationship to Piper was - although I understand that some of them were very private and didn't share their lives with Piper, so it would have been difficult to write about them in a way that made different people easily identifiable.<br /><br />Easily the most disturbing part of her story came towards the end, when she was moved to Chicago to be a witness in another case - her trip on Con Air, and her stay in Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Centre really highlighted the terrible faults in the prison system, although Danbury was certainly no picnic.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't find Piper easy to connect or empathise with, which was both a negative and a positive.  A negative in that I couldn't put myself in her shoes, but a positive in that I could see the bigger picture of what was happening around her, without being caught up in emotion.<br /><br />I did expect Orange is the New Black to be a little tougher, and a little grittier, but it was the stories of friendship, co-operation and unity between the majority of the prisoners that really made this book for me.hip, co-operation and unity between the majority of the prisoners that really made this book for me.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|Package came exactly as shown on the site. All three movies are in their own case, and packed with extras. For the price, as well as the content, this is one of the best values i've gotten in a long time. Looks great on blu ray. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good action/thriller movie, or just a fan of Matt Damon.
0425263908|1.0|With a few slight changes, this book was a pathetic attempt to redo 50 Shades of Grey. There were seriously quotes from this book that the author took word for word out of the FSOG books. There was a few small changes in the story behind the love affair, but the only reason I tried this book is because there's not a fourth FSOG book. The love between the characters was not believeable, you couldn't relate to the characters because the author was too busy trying to copy another book that she didn't bother developing the characters at all.<br /><br />Instead of buying this book, re-read FSOG!
B001992NUQ|5.0|The package came as shown, and very quickly. I had this on dvd, but on blu ray it is like a whole different movie. Not all movies transfer well, but this movie was made for blu ray. TONS of extras, both from the original dvd, and several new to this release. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes movies that actually make you think. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are awesome in this.
0345803507|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series. I have read it multiple times. E.L James- WRITE A 4th BOOK! I just finished \\"Bared to You\\" and wanted to throw up at the pathetic attempt to redo your story.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I can't say enough good about this app!  I'd been looking for an app that does a good job on Canadian Weather - short of the Canadian Weather Network - which is currently unavailable on the Kindle Fire.  This one beats the closest competitor by a long shot!  It's got great graphics and presentation, an excellent interactive map of the location area, it's very easy to use, and the ads are non-intrusive.  Oh, and did I mention - \\"FREE!\\"  Great job, AMAZON!
B005CM9DX6|5.0|If you're a prog rock/metal fan who that likes Dream Theater, Redemption, Sieges Even, you'll love this. Their song writing has always been cutting edge and exceptional. The problem for me has been the mix of beautiful vocals polluted with sporadic growling (a la death metal). This is Opeth's first album without any growling vocals. You won't be disappointed.
0375507256|5.0|It's been quite awhile since I've read something that's moved me to write a review, but this book got me excited about structure and genre in a way that few others have.  I understand how some reviewers were put off by the extremely self-conscious choices involved in creating six stories of different styles and genres; they seem to have missed the forest for the trees.  Mr. Mitchell has written a love-letter to story-telling in all its forms, and in so doing, has reminded us why fiction is a vibrant art, as evocative as it is provocative when practiced by someone as skilled with language and deft in handling the conventions of genre as he.  As a whole, the book brings to mind the acrobatics of Italo Calvino's If On A Winter's Night A Traveler or Osamu Tezuka's Phoenix series; individually, the stories are the children of such diverse parents as Ridley Walker, Silkwood, and Gatsby.  Also, as many have mentioned, it's a wonderful refutation of the horrors of Ayn Rand and her \\"selfishness is good\\" nonsense.  Can't wait to read Thousand Autumns.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I purchased both the regular Plants vs Zombies  and Plants vs. Zombies HD on Android marketplace.<br />I have had a couple system rebuilds this year on my device. But Android Market restores my  purchsed apps and<br />games.  It just occurred to me I no longer had Plant's vs. Zombies and couldn't find it on Market. Learned about<br />the Amazon  situation.

Well stuff like this is in the entire book... sexual references with orgasms from her inner lesbian goddess and 6 year old writimg.

B005LAII3A|3.0|I kept thinking about the original film while watching this one. To put it simply: Arnold was better than Colin Farrell. Kate Beckinsale in the expanded role is better than Sharon Stone, and I really love them both. Jessica Biel is better than anyone, if you don't believe me, ask her. What I really liked about this film is the updated special effects, down to the electronic notes on the refrigerator door. I love attention to detail.<br /><br />The action was fast paced. The future looks similar to \\"The Fifth Element\\" but with more computer gizmos. If you have seen the original version, then you can miss the first few minutes of this one and be able to pick it up.<br /><br />For some reason they eliminated all the fun aspects of going to Mars. That is why we watched the first film. Instead we get a film where we simply root for the terrorists. The terrorists are revolting against the Chancellor who wants to replace workers with synthetics, although this theme was poorly developed.<br /><br />One of the aspects of both productions that I didn't like was the initial dream sequence. Had they eliminated that from both films, then the genius of the script would have been the ambiguity of reality vs. the recall machine.<br /><br />The film included 3D holograms, Star Wars stormtroopers, Bill Nighy for a brief moment, and an inadvertent mention of an old film \\"Hauser's Memory.\\"<br /><br />What I didn't like about this film was all the action. It didn't have drama scenes outside of the beginning. No colorful characters. No time for a Biel/ Farrell love scene. It was like watching someone play a video game. Seriously, where was the writing? The clever lines? The complex character? The relationship? Any moron can write \\"Bang bang, run shoot, bang, chase, shoot, bang.\\"<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-Bomb, Nudity (Kaitlyn Leeb wearing a fake chest) no sex. 3 stars is pushing it. Can't wait for the video game.

0553801473|5.0|After the slow, ponderous pace of Book 4, I seriously questioned if I wanted to get Book 5. Let's just say I think he redeemed the series with this book. Book 4 had super-long chapters and it was just far too much about Cersei's plotting and seemingly little else. Book 5 flowed a better and faster, I felt, and had several very interesting plot twists (though one or two I figured out before they were revealed). After slogging through Book 4, I was back in \\"can't put it down\\" mode with this book - it screwed with my sleep!  Naturally, I have no clue where GRRM is going to take the narrative in Book 6 and beyond, but I can't wait to find out!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the game and new levels!  I hope they come out with more.  If you need a break to totally forget everything around you for a few min, try it!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really like the game though some of thebgmaes are a little hard. it is a very good app for me to kill some time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I got this book as an ebook from the public library. I figured I would read it since there was all this hype about this book and it is a #1 best seller.  I had no idea what this book was about as I did not read the description.<br /><br />When I first started reading it, I was intrigued about the relationship between Christian and Ana. Christian is a billonaire and it drop dead gorgeous. He knows how to fly, talk French, play the piano, you get the idea. Christian also has a playroom that Ana calls the red room of pain. Christian is into BDSM and all his 'female companions' have been his 'sub' to his 'dom'. Ana just graduated college and is very smart--you can look at her g.p.a. for this. Ana is also a bit niave and when she first met him. She has a tendency to bit her lower lip, which drives Christian crazy, roll her eyes, and other stuff. When they get together, she usually ends up in a state of euphoric bliss.<br /><br />Christian past is also something that he likes to keep there-in the past. Ana comes from a bit of a different background, her mom is on marriage what number 4? Ana step-dad is one she thinks of as her dad (even though he is divorced from her mom). Though both Ana and Christian do have some jealousy in themselves.<br /><br />When Christian and Ana met and they were strangly drawn to each other. Ana is a bit curious, one could say, and is willing to learn about Christian sexual habit but, does not agree to all the 'rules' that go with it. Ana wants to know Christian, why he is the way he is and what happened to him. He on the other hand wants to pamper her and take care of her, wants to give her things, i.e. a computer, first edition books car, etc. Ana is unable to accept things even as a gift, like an upgrade on an airplane flight. Christian tells Ana small little tidbits about himself that he has never told anyone else. Both of them have 'first' with each other for several different things.<br /><br />Yes, you could say this book is erotic is away--you read about the red room of pain and what goes on there. Though, Ana can be a bit annoying, I can not tell you how many times I read that she was bitting her lower lip or wanted/did an eye roll, not to mention that she seems to have an orgasm at everything, the way he looks at her with the smirks, his touch, the way he says her name and so forth. Ana does her from her subconscious and her inner goddess. There is plenty of sex in this book, in the bedroom, in the red room, in the shower, even on the desk--you get the idea.<br /><br />Ana and Christian have a hard time telling each other their thoughts at times but, will freely admit them in emails they send back and forth. When they are not with each other, they think about each other. and they do not want to be without each other. Christian is trying to find a way to give 'more' to Ana. To give her the relationship that she desires. I think he is a bit curious about her as she test him, you know, sort of pushes the line and I don't think he has ever been with anyone like that. She wants to be with him but, also wants her independence. She wants to have, for lack of better words, a fairy tale romance.<br /><br />Even though parts of the book are repetative in things, and the writing is not the best, I will admit that I am curious to see what transpires between both of them. I know there are 2 more books after this one so, obviously they are able to work out their differences and come to some sort of agreement and I will be reading them to find out.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that I liked it for the most part even though it started slow and took a bit for me to get into the story. You do have to have an open mind to like this book.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|\\"Bad Teacher\\" is not a great movie. It's not supposed to be. Cameron Diaz plays the worst teacher on the planet. She comes to school hungover. She smokes pot in her car in the school parking lot. She embezzles money from the seventh grade car wash fundraiser. The list goes on and on and on. But, for what it is, this movie is completely hilarious. I have only seen this unrated version, and it made me laugh from start to finish. If you are looking for a cheap but great laugh, this is a good movie to watch.
1609611543|5.0|This book has probably just saved my life. It is a must read for all Americans stuck in the Wheat Belly rut. After 5 surgeries, over a dozen MRI's, CT's, xrays, allergy tests, medicines, autoimmunue diseases etc.... I finally feel like I have the golden ticket. Only 2 weeks of eating \\"wheat-free\\", and the results are AMAZING. Dr. Davis for PRESIDENT.. LOL :)If I could pay him a million dollars I would surely do so!

0807014273|5.0|My most recent purchase of \\"Man Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor F. Frankl was so that I might gift my first copy to our church library. From cradle to grave man searches for meaning in life. Viktor Frankl was already a distinguished psychiatrist when the Second World War broke out and he and his family where brutally torn from their lives and thrown into concentration camps. Frankl's account of his experiences there and observations of human behavior in most extreme situations is riveting.In the reading of it, you will be forever changed.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a really fun and fresh game to try out, there's a lot more to it than just building house's and stuff which is a nice thing in this game.
B0073U2F2Q|4.0|While it's nothing like ''metro 2033'' ( I compare movie to this because the book is so very good) and we are dealing with aliens and monsters, the movie came out to be pretty good. I can't say I enjoyed the movie right from beginning and here's why. While the plot is simple, the beginning looks too much like typical american movies. I couldn't get rid of that feeling through the whole movie. I know the movie was ALSO meant for English speaking audience, but I would love to hear less or no English. It would make the movie much different in my opinion. I think of Korean, Chinese or Japanese movies that I see with subtitles and still enjoy. They either have little or no English and it proves that they can still be very enjoyable. I've seen American actors right from the beginning 'til the very end of the movie. What's new? They are pretty much like other american young actors I've seen. Some are good, some are bad, those from ''the darkest hour'' are pretty much like the rest. There are a few likable characters, and guess what? I think those were ''soldiers''/defenders of the city. Electrician with his cat is a funny type of guy, likable character as well. Another good thing about the movie is that beside of that ''business guy'' who spoke Russian with an accent, the rest spoke real Russian. Unlike MANY american movies, where Russian is actually spoken by Czechs, Ukraininans, Estonian people, etc. It's a fact that many can't see or hear any difference. I was glad to see something new in ''the darkest hour''. Overall, graphics and the city in this movie like everything else, look good. I still wish that half of the movie had no typical american beginning. I've seen it all, I've seen too much of it. Last  but not least, the trailer for the movie is worse than an actual movie. Not bad, it is worth watching.
B00633W614|5.0|Purchased both books in the Clifton Chronicles series thru Amazon.com/Kindle books and enjoyed both immensely.  I'm hoping for a third book.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|This could very easily be a five star book.  Unfortunately, the framing narrative is distracting and pointless.  Also, the first 30 pages are so are awful.  I bought this for my Nook and went on a trip.  I had not wifi connection, so I was stuck with it.  I'm glad that I did stick with it, because after the initial disappointment, this turned out to be an absolutely great read. I've already suggested it to several of my friends, with the above mentioned warning.  If the author could have run the book through a tough editor, loosing maybe 10% of it's weight, it would have helped a lot.  Still, a solid 4 as is.

B008CP93S0|3.0|this movie was completely over the top and silly.  It did have some funny moments and was a comedy worth renting.  It is very light and silly funny but not the best comedy.
B007J2TMQ0|2.0|This author is a prolific producer of Military History books with a good record & a string of publications of that genere. That said a careful reading of this book reveals nothing new of startling & contains some very irritating factual errors that reveal a lack of research or different contributors to particular parts of the research or book. I will leave it to the readers to find the errors however start with a Admiral named Carnaris. Amongst my 3000 plus military book libary this particular volume sits in the bottom 40 percentile alongside the latter publications of Max Hasings an author of a similiar style & genere which also contain the same irritating factual errors
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i like it because it lets me keep in touch with family in a fun way. drawing has never been my strong suit but stickmen are great to use.
0345803485|1.0|This book is horrible. It's horribly written, and the plot is pathetic. I am ashamed of every single person who has read this and enjoyed it. And with it coming from the world of fanfiction, it is giving us a bad reputation. Not all fanfiction works are like this, please believe me.
B008LP8QE8|1.0|The text is wonderful. The publisher has failed to recognize and harness what ebooks are about. The text is unreadably small, and moving from page to page is cumbersome. If I can find an alternate, I will be seeking a refund.

0393088774|5.0|There are only a couple of people I consider worthy of much respect in the worlds of politics and economics. One of them, David Gergen, doesn't write many books. Paul Krugman is the other. He writes brilliantly and is right on-target about many of the issues that concern me most. This book, \\"End This Depression Now!\\" is worth reading, regardless of where you fall politically. Krugman's thoughtful approach appeals to me. I recommend his book to all readers who are looking for answers to our nation's very serious economic problems.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Simply put, this production of Pride and Prejudice is just lame. Mr. Bennet has not the wit, nor Darcy the charm, nor Elizabeth the grace of the characters in the book. There is hardly any romantic chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy in this film; the movie relies on skillful editing instead of skillful acting to capture the audience. The brevity of the film and the resulting omission of parts of the original story leave this film flat. A much more charming, captivating, and true-to-the-original (albeit much longer) production is the BBC/A&E production, and I would recommend that one instead.

B00005ATQM|5.0|Everybody knows Metallica - Black Album, ITs a great album, not he best from Metallica IMO, but very very good indeed (personally  I like Master of Puppets and ...and Justice for All more).<br /><br />Listening to this album in surroind hi rez audio makes this album so much better. Its sound fuller as it is greatly mixed.<br />I have to say The Unforgiven and Nothing else matter benefit the most form the rear speakers, but this doesnt mean the rest sounds mellow.<br /><br />Sad but true sounds brutal, Holier than thou makes you want to jump all around the room, and Of Wolf and Men sounds as hard as a kick in your stomach.<br /><br />If you own a DVDA player and a surround reciever, buy this album.

My findings confirm that this new version indeed equals or surpasses the original film.From the acting,the stunts and special effects,they all add up to a nicely updated and badder version of Corman's original.And who should be on hand to pilot this version?;none other than Corman himself.It is chock full of some great actors  backing up star Jason Statham,such as British veteran Ian McShane,Joan Allen,Tyrese Gibson and even David Carradine,who drops by to play the original Frankenstein under that frightful mask.However there is something I think quite important to tell you that the case of this DVD does NOT;at least I could not see it.When you are at the main menu on the DVD there is an asterisk beside the unrated version saying this version MIGHT affect the playability of the movie. What the....? I do not understand why it would or should.Thankfully my player had no perceptible problems at all,but I thought you should be pre-warned as to what possibly to expect,as Universal seems unwilling to be honest enough to be upfront about it on the case.I deducted an entire star for this faux paux/deception.<br />The plot finds Statham,a hard working steel worker being laid off from his job.He goes home to his wife and while he is upstairs tending to his unsettled baby,a break in occurs in the kitchen.When Statham returns his wife is dead on the floor and he and the intruder have a scuffle.Statham is knocked down and out,but just before he fades out the killer makes a motion with his hand in the form of a shooting pistol.The killer has planted the knife in Stathams hand,so when the police arrive,it is Statham of course who is deemed to be the killer.<br />Fast forward and Statham is being taken to and incarcerated in the penal facility on Terminal island.No one escapes from this facility and for entertainment the warden,Joan Allen,has set up a Death race,in which prisoners who drive in it,after five consecutive wins,can get paroled out.The warden propositions Statham to take the place of a popular driver called Frankenstein,who died in the last race;one win away from getting his freedom.<br />Statham agrees but something is not right.Statham was a former race driver in civilian life,so is it coincidence that he is there?During the first race,Statham sees a hand gesture from of the other drivers,the same one from the killer of his wife.On top of this some of his equipment has been mysteriously malfunctioning.It seems the warden has used one her own prisoners to knock off Stathams wife,in order to continue on with Frankenstein.Also Statham will apparently never get out of the prison,if the warden has anything to do with it.<br />The deadly races,viewed by millions on the internet,continues full blown as the drivers slowly dwindle down the playing field,through horrific crashes/deaths.Statham and his arch rival Tyrese Gibson,go head to head, but the two have agreed to work together,first to eliminate a souped up tanker truck called the Dreadnought,and then to escape off the island.<br />Gibson's truck is loaded with missiles and nicely blows a hole in the side of the track big enough for the two of them to leave the facility.Both ditch their rides and escape on foot,while the warden gets a small thank you package,in which is an explosive.<br />The next time we see Statham and Gibson they are working as mechanics down in Mexico and enjoying their new found freedom and life.<br />I certainly prefer the extended version,with an extra 6 minutes of footage added,as it fleshes out the characters and the plot a little bit more.But in the end,as always,it's up to you to decide for yourself.The race itself takes up most of the film,and the stunt works/car crashes and technical effects used to create it all are nothing short of spectacular.Statham is right on his game in this one,with his usual intensity and menace.<br />Technically speaking we have the theatrical and unrated versions on one single disc(one sided),and both are clear and crisp and in their w/s a/r's of 2:35:1.Extras includes some featurettes on the films making and the stunt work,and commentary by its director.<br />All in all a nice film with some awesome stunt work and rad racing.The race will have you on the edge of your seat,guaranteed.One star deducted for Universal's unforgivable lapse in pre-warning the consumer about possible playability issues with the unrated version.3 1/2 stars.e the theatrical and unrated versions on one single disc(one sided),and both are clear and crisp and in their w/s a/r's of 2:35:1.Extras includes some featurettes on the films making and the stunt work,and commentary by its director.<br />All in all a nice film with some awesome stunt work and rad racing.The race will have you on the edge of your seat,guaranteed.One star deducted for Universal's unforgivable lapse in pre-warning the consumer about possible playability issues with the unrated version.3 1/2 stars.

0807014273|5.0|I recently completed a master's in counseling and guidance and have been reading to find a set of books that will best address some of the disorders in the DSM-IV. Following is a list I have put together from my reading so far, and these are books that I would HIGHLY recommend. I would like to say up front that the DSM-IV is full of very normal behaviors that for some reason have become magnified or exaggerated in an individual to the point of causing a negative impact in their daily lives. Take OCD for example, it is quite normal and even preferable (from a safety perspective) to check and be sure that one has turned off all the burners on the stove after cooking, or to be sure the back door is locked before going to bed. But to continue checking time and again would be problematic and can lead to problems in an individual's life. Something is diagnosed as a disorder when it moves from being a \\"normal\\" activity to being something that causes dysfunction in daily living. So, one may read the DSM-IV and see themselves reflected in many of the disorders. The question is always: is this behavior negatively impacting my life? If so then that is when it crosses the line of normal and needs to be treated.<br /><br />Depression; I believe there are two sources for depression: one source is our own minds, we think ourselves into the depression - at least in this case we know where it is coming from and we should be able to step behind our thoughts and help ourselves move in a better direction. The other source seemingly comes from nowhere; one minute we are okay and the next we are thrown into the depths<br />* Book = \\"Transforming Depression: Healing the Soul Through Creativity\\"- David H. Rosen\\"<br />o I would recommend reading this at least through chapter 4, going further than that delves into some deep Jungian psychology which will not likely appeal to everyone. I certainly enjoy Jungian psychology and believe that Jung's work will become more and more important and critical to our understanding as we move forward in this field of psychology. Jung's psychology is really on the borderland between spirit/soul and the science of psychology and it is Jung's work that brought me into this field. However it is quite complex/deep/different and may lose some readers. For a very good intro to Jung's work, I would recommend \\"The Essential Jung\\" by Anthony Storr, but this is not light reading as is composed of excerpts from Jung's collected works.<br />* Book = \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" - Viktor Frankl<br />o I would recommend this book for two primary reasons: one is it pushes very strongly the message that meaning is essential in our lives - as shown through Victor Frankl's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps. Frankl comments on how he observed the individuals who gave up the fight and died, and the individuals who persevered -  and most importantly what it was that he believes made the difference. The other reason I recommend this book is that it helps the individuals whose thoughts may have led them to depression to realize that things could be worse. Of course there are devastations we may face that can truly be to us, just as bad as a Nazi concentration camps, but for the most part, we often push ourselves into depression for reasons that are somewhat superficial compared to other realities.<br /><br />Depersonalization Disorder - essentially feeling like you are not really there<br />* Book = \\"Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self\\" - Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel<br />o Excellent book which will help folks understand this disorder. This is for me a very interesting disorder, I think this is one disorder where the connection between our ego consciousness and perhaps what we are at a much deeper level is challenged. Normally we are locked into full belief in our reality  - we believe we are very much a part of it and that we \\"are\\" the body in which we reside. This disorder forces us to question ifwe are the body we think we are. It would appear that whatever piece of our mind is keeping us in full belief is breaking down a bit, leaving us a bit outside of the \\"normal\\" feeling of being the body. Folks with this disorder can actually worry that they do not have control of their body and that this body may do something they do not want it to do. Driving a car for example can be quite traumatic if you think your body may be acting without your input.<br /><br />Bipolar disorder - the book I am recommending is focused on Bipolar II disorder - essentially swinging from manic (very happy and carefree) to severe depression. This book was actually required reading during the Masters program<br />* Book = \\"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness\\" by Kay Redfield Jamison<br />o Excellent book written by a psychologist who suffers from this disorder. This book helps to understand the importance of medication for this disorder, as well as the path of destruction that can easily be paved during carefree, manic episodes.<br /><br />ADHD (attention deficit disorder)<br />* Book = \\"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It\\" - Gabor Mate<br />o This is not just a great book for folks with ADHD, but for everyone - as many of the lessons here translate to all of us. This is an extremely excellent book on ADHD and living in general.<br />OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)<br />* Book = \\"Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\" - Ian Osborn<br />o Excellent book on OCD - this book will help individuals with OCD as well as those who know someone with the disorder - to understand what is happening in the mind of a person with this disorder. This book will also help OCD folks realize that they are not alone and that many of the rituals or compulsions are shared by other folks with OCD.<br /><br />That is all for now, but I am still readingwe are the body we think we are.

B0085A9HXS|4.0|This martial arts import from Indonesia is guaranteed to satisfy those who enjoy a good knuckle crunching, knife slashing, body tossing, blood spurting adrenalin rush.  The plot as it were, involves a 20 man S.W.A.T. team in Jakarta who has a covert mission to take out a narcotics cartel located in a rundown tenement high rise.  It doesn't go well as the drug boss has a man on the inside and has anticipated the raid.<br /><br />What follows is the violent exchange between the good guys and the bad guys and it lasts about 95 minutes once they get going.  Every conceivable object is used as a weapon ranging from automatic rifles to light bulbs.  In many respects, the film is nothing new.  Grunts and groans with every punch permeate the film from beginning to end.  The bad guys usually only attack one at a time rather than in swarms.  And when they have the numbers advantage they don't have guns.<br /><br />Yet, some of this can be forgiven as the quarters are tight, usually in hallways.  The actors involved are also pretty good.  They seem believable.  Sure they are strong and tough but they also fear the unknown and the consequences.  I'm not saying see the film for the acting, but hey it's something different.  The filmmaking itself is also first rate.  Welsh director Gareth Evans knows what he's doing and the fight choreography and stunts are as good as you'll see.  I'm guessing the medical tent on the set was pretty full most of the time.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer comes in with a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Frankly it is a bit disappointing watched on my screen.  Even with the stark, dark photograpy the picture doesn't have much life to it.  There a bland texture on both the exterior and interior scenes.  The color is washed out.  I didn't see this in a theater so it's hard to determine if this should have been expected.  The audio is a bit better with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track in both English and Indonesian.  While not perfect, the bullets do seem to be coming from everywhere and the music is clear and defined.  Viewers can also choose from 2 different music tracks while watching the film which is a bit unusual.ullets do seem to be coming from everywhere and the music is clear and defined.

B008MEM24S|5.0|thanks great game I loved it and I hope there are more levels to come soon. I have really loved playing it.
0345803507|1.0|OK OK OK now before i read the 1st book i had heard of fifty shades and honestly i thought it was a crime/thriller or something...how wrong i was now i read all three books because i love kinky sex hell i love sex period bbuut as i continued to read these books i have come to the conclusion that this slow retarded ass girl Ana is just a plain ass goofy (excuse my French...its better than English) yes I detected London stewing in these books. ( I have seen all the Harry Potters so i know some of their meanings and phrases) Ana is suffering from BWS \\"Battered Woman Syndrome\\" because she always seem to think its her fault whenever Christian gets mad and that inner goddess needs to go do something with herself no matter what she does she gets punished for it and to top it off at times Ana's on goddess blames her for making this guy mad; she stands up for herself and Christian snaps claiming that she is defying him....EXCUSE ME!!!! She can't go out with her friends i don't know if anybody else noticed this but it seems that shortly after Christian took her virginity he knew she belonged to him and he secluded her from her friends and family. are u freaking serious she has to ask permission to see her friends?????? and for a man as rich and as handsome as Christian Grey he apparently takes the whole \\"I OWN THE WORLD SO I DONT HAVE TO ANSWER TO A BOARD SERIOUSLY\\" I dont know about the rest of you but I like my space Ana has yet to have space to breath the moment she mentions space he goes loco and when she was goin to leave him he turned into a submissive...and I instantly peeped his game he knew how weak and pathetic she is and he used that against her to make her stay and marry him. But the killer part to me was the fact that she could get all tough an strong against Mrs. Robinson calling her all types of names which were true but u cant stand up to a man who gets his kicks off of whooping your ass?? Smh then Ana slow ass has now come to believe that she likes these beatings because it make her Fifty happy \\"Bitch please!!!\\" i can go on an on about these to sickos but i wont i got most of my complaints across... Hell if EL James can write horrible books as trilogies then i need to get started too.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|I is a great emulatio of the HP-15C Scientific calculator with added screens we never had with the original. Conversion screen all type of units, screen for memory stored values and the like. I just wish I could get it or one similar with most of the function and RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) installed on my Archos 43. The problem is the Archos 43 is only up to Andriod 2.2 and Archos won't offer and upgrade because they want you to buy their Gen 9 devises so I bought Asus Transformer TF201 instead. The Asus is great too large carry around in your pocket. I know the Archos 43 can't be upgraded to Honeycomb or Ice Cream Cone, because it is a single core processor devise, but it could be upgraded to GINGERBREAD (Andriod 2.3) and then it could run one of the HP-11c type emulators just fine.

B008R9N7CO|4.0|Call me a sometime Sacha Baron Cohen fan.  While I liked \\"Borat\\" (in a perverse way), I thought Bruno was pretty stupid and not particularly funny.  \\"The Dictator\\" is more Borat than Bruno.  Cohen plays the part of a ruthless dictator of a North African country that is trying to develop all kinds of weapons of mass destruction but is particularly fond of a nuclear bomb.  He argues with his chief weapons scientist because he insists the bomb have a \\"pointy\\" end.  The scientist, Nadal is played by Jason Mantzoukas (TV's \\"The League\\").  He manages to steal almost every scene he's in.<br /><br />Aladeen, the Dictator, must travel to New York to address the U.N. so that military action is not taken against his country by the rest of the world.  Once there he is replaced by a lookalike (also Cohen) under the control of his assistant and political rival (a smirking Ben Kingsley).  Like most great comedians who use insults and extremism to be funny, Cohen (who also co-wrote) goes after everybody and everything including the democratic form of government.<br /><br />In one scene he defends his political change from a dictatorship to democracy using the U. S. as his beacon by defining current political differences as examples.  The \\"one-percenters\\" won't likely be laughing.  The film is loaded with numerous cameos including Megan Fox as herself having a one-night stand with Aladeen.  Cohen's material will offend many so take this as fair warning.  For me, I found this more hilarious than cringe-worthy.  I liked it in spite of the fact than many of the punch lines had been given away in the numerous TV and movie trailers.<br /><br />The Blu ray is shown in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is digitally shot but has a look of film and is very good.  Colors of varying hues are part of the film's fun and they are excellently projected here.  The primary audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While it might not be demo worthy, it is still very good.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds but this is the nature of the film.  Center channeled dialog is clear.  The package includes a DVD version, several deleted scenes, a music video and more.n in the surrounds but this is the nature of the film.

0425263908|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised about how good this book was. I could relate to the woman character, Eva, more than I could Anatasia in 50 Shades. Its not as similar to 50 Shades as some of the other reviews indicated but some scenes will make you blush.<br />The only bad thing about it is the next book isn't out yet and I have wait for it. I would've read it slower if I knew that!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Or perhaps more of a page 'tapper' since it's a Kindle book. One of the best things I can say about this collection is that I found myself tapping on the screen much more rapidly than with other books. Kindle users know what I mean... I couldn't put it down, and often found myself racing through chapters. Compelling- is the word.<br /><br />I just finished Book 5 a few minutes before writing this. Normally not much of a book reviewer, but considering this is the author's bread and butter, I felt obligated to come on here and let people know that they really should buy this book. The characters are surprisingly interesting, and the writer's style is full of abundant musing and well observed inner thought as the story efficiently progresses- which is a style of writing I enjoy. Attention to style and craft of prose is often sorely missing these days, frequently replaced with childish simplicity. But here, there is effort, thoughtfulness and a great balance between sophistication and ease of reading. There's no shortage of action for the action-lovers either, but really, this is a book about ideas. The best kind of books are about ideas.<br /><br />Kudos to the author- a job well done. Now I'm off to read the 6th book, the prequel. Side note, I look forward to this becoming a film some day; I hear that may be in the works...
B008NEMPTO|3.0|May contain spoilers.<br /><br />I like to think I can appreciate a premise so far removed from reality as this, and certainly the filmmaker's and writers had a choice.  Do we play this up with a bit of campy humor or go with the serious-play-it-straight direction.  They chose the latter.  As a boy, young Abe sees his mother slain by a vampire and vows revenge.  Years later as a young man (Benjamin Walker), he is schooled by  a mysterious stranger (Dominic Cooper) in the art of killing vampires.  Abe's weapon of choice is a silver laden ax, because he has some experience splitting rails.  Abe becomes quite adept to the point of spinning that ax like a cheerleader's baton.<br /><br />Interwoven during his vampire removal time in Springfield, Illinois he meets his wife Mary (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), gets elected to Congress and eventually the presidency.  In a career defining period of the Civil War, Lincoln learns that the vampires are siding with the Confederates because the slaves are nourishment for the vampires.  In a terrific scene he confounds the vampire leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) boarding a train full of silver that will be used to arm the Union soldiers.  It's all misdirection, easily spotted but the confrontation on the train is well done.  Director Timur Bekmambetov has some experience dealing with vampires with \\"Day Watch\\" and \\"Night Watch\\" both rather leisurely paced thrillers.  I think a less serious tone might have helped with this film.  At least a few Bond-like quips to lighten the surroundings.

B008QE9VJI|3.0|May contain spoilers.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp team up again for yet another version of their quirkiness.  OK, we get it.  While I never watched the \\"Dark Shadows\\" soap opera, I understand it was not supposed to be humorous.  So when transplanted to the screen should it have been more serious?  Eh, maybe not.  But at least make up your mind.<br /><br />The movie begins with something similar to Coppala's version of \\"Dracula\\" (1992) where Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed by a witch around 1776 for spurning her love for another.  He becomes a vampire but is soon captured and buried in a silver chained coffin.  Nearly 200 years later the coffin is uncovered at a construction site and Barnabas is set free.  He finds his old homestead is in a poor state and that his fishing enterprise has floundered and replaced by a witchy descendent of Angelique (Eva Green).  Spoiler alert:  The witch is the same person, but has aged well.<br /><br />Barnabas confides in the current head of the household Elizabeth (a still stunning Michelle Pfeiffer) of his secret but doesn't \\"come out\\" to the others until later.  The house is filled with off kilter children (Chloe Moretz and Gulliver McGrath) and even weirder adult staffers (Jackie Earle Haley, Helena Bonham Carter and Ray Shirley).  Then of course there is the beautiful Bella Heathcote as Victoria, the reincarnation of Barnabas original love from 1776 who was offed by an Angelique spell.<br /><br />The film is full of some excellent photography and well used CGI but it continually bogs down.  Full of fits and starts, it can't make up its mind what kind of movie it is supposed to be.  I did think the scene where Barnabas can't resist the amorous advances of Angelique to be pretty good.  And we do learn with certainty that when a vampire has sex, bedrooms are destroyed (see \\"True Blood\\" and \\"Twilight: Breaking Dawn\\" for further proof).  Although the ending includes an opening for a sequel, I wouldn't bet on it happening.it happening.
0547569653|5.0|Eat, run, and the psychology of being an ultra runner - these are the three unifying themes of the entire book, all equally important.<br /><br />If you have always wondered what motivates a runner to enter a 100 mile race, how it feels, and what it takes, then this book will get you right into the action with half a dozen, well-documented encounters. You can relive the agony, and the glory, from the comfort of your chair. Or, do one better, grab the audiobook and head for the longest trail in your neighborhood.<br /><br />The food, and the fact that Scott is a vegan is another fascinating theme. Most trainers to this day will give you odd looks if you propose to combine serious training and going vegan. Scott documents many of his own discoveries and recipes along the way. I think we all stand to benefit from Scott's example in this respect.<br /><br />Finally, there is the man himself, and, well, it's complicated. What motivates someone to become a professional ultra runner? The endorphins, the need to \\"run away\\", or a search for deeper meaning? In Scott's case, it appears to be all of the above, in various dozes of different stages of his life.<br /><br />A fascinating story. Enjoyed it throughly.

B00846TTDG|3.0|First of all, this is just a movie review. I watched this with an old friend in the streaming version. One of us having been in the military and me having helped manufacture and sell many of the items that went \\"boom\\" in this movie made us both interested in the project. There were no subtitles on the streaming video and despite us both having a lot of familiarity with general military jargon, subtitles are a \\"must\\" unless you are involved in special operations. If the DVD does not come with some kind of basic \\"jargon - translator\\", there are just some things that will keep you asking, \\"What does that mean?\\"<br /><br />Second, the film style was largely like a first-person shooter video game, where you are looking through weapon sites. If you love that kind of video game, and love explosions and firefights, you will enjoy large parts of this movie.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:<br />The place where this movie bogs down was in the story. To me, it was entirely too predictable. For example, my friend and I looked at one another as soon as one of the SEAL characters, played by a real SEAL, was revealed to be expecting his first child with his lovely wife, and said, \\"He's toast,\\" because that has been a cliche of so many war movies for 50 or 60 years at least.<br /><br />One of the keys of great drama is that a movie should make us \\"care\\" about the characters. We care about these characters -- real Naval personnel and SEALS because we should care -- not because we really care about these characters. We are given \\"thumbnail\\" sketches of what should have been told another way. For example, one character relates how depressed his \\"old man\\" was when he realized \\"he was no longer dangerous.\\" What a great opportunity to flash-back to the actual scene and get real impact! Instead, it is related as a second-hand memory and loses what could have been thoughtful character development.<br /><br />Not to disparage the efforts of the SEAL and Naval personnel cast, but I never hadenough of any one character to develope a real impression of him (or her). I blame the writer(s) for this or even remember their names. No time was really spent SHOWING US why these men, or any men, become SEALS. No time was spent SHOWING US the real impact this career choice has on their family life. No time was spent telling us what the \\"life of a SEAL\\" outside of combat is like. For example, how are rotations and assignments handled? No time was spent showing us what makes a man choose SEALS . . .as opposed to Special Forces . . .as opposed to Force Recon Marines.<br /><br />I know from several close friends who have served with or worked with SEALS what the real price these people often pay for their career choice. This is emphatically NOT being in the regular military. As an American, it seems to me that a proper treatment of this important subject would have exposed us to an understanding of what the real cost (not merely paid in blood) is.<br /><br />We get plenty of firefights, plenty of exciting technology in infiltrations and \\"exfiltrations\\", and plenty of certified-charicature heroes and bad-guys.<br /><br />The most interesting \\"bad guy\\" was the Russian (Russian bad-guy! What are the odds?) Christos. He could have been a really interesting character with a little development.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:<br />(1) If you want to see how real SEALs talk, fight, and serve on missions, by all means see this movie.<br />(2) If you want a real story deeper than a comic book, this will disappoint. I really enjoyed \\"The Heart and The Fist\\" -- a superb book on what motivated on man to become a SEAL officer.<br /><br />I have a old friend, and two of her sons have become SEALS. I haven't met them or talked to them, but this gave me very little insight into what their lives, other that shooting people, rescuing people, or blowing stuff up, are like.<br /><br />Having read a number of Tom Clancy novels (who USED to be a good storyteller), I am afraid I expected the shortcomings of this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Super cute story line; Ana's character and thoughts are ones that, I think, all girls can relate to and enjoy reading (I certainly did). I have heard people call it girl porn; don't be discouraged to read this if that's a deciding factor. It's simply a sexy love story with some interesting twists. I recommend this book.

B000001DV2|5.0|This is a great classic Def Leppard CD. You won't be disappointed buying this. This is actually a good one to buy if you are going to catch them on their current tour. They are such a great band to see live and they actually perform songs from their entire catalog. This is a great CD, I am glad that I bought it. If you are a Def Leppard fan then it is a must have for your collection!
B005LAII3A|5.0|MINOR SPOILERS<br /><br />I don't know why the bad reviews, I walked out of the theater texting a friend the exact title of this review. Good old-fashioned action movie with beautiful modern effects. Why do people complain about eye candy? Just because there's lots of it doesn't mean that's all there is! The story is still there, virtually unchanged (thank you for the hooker with 3 tits and the woman at customs who says 'two weeks' from the original!) I thought the acting was great, not that there was a whole lot of it, too busy shooting at each other! In fact, most of the story/character development took place mid-combat, but it was still there. Kate Beckinsale dogged Colin Farrell almost two solid hours in one long chase scene that managed to never get boring (10 points for originality in the zero-G gunfight). Another reviewer complains about Kate throwing Colin around like a rag-doll when he is supposed to be a better trained agent of twice her size and strength...yea there's two reasons for that: 1 - People want to see it. 2 - He is hesitant to kill her because the last thing he knew, she was his beloved wife! He is much more defending himself than really trying to take her down. Yes he shoots at her but its much easier (emotionally and physically) to shoot someone than to kill them with your bare hands, even if you know how. I saw this as part of his character development. He is not a bad guy, he's just trying to figure out WTF is going on. When he finally decides to kill her, its over pretty quickly.<br /><br />Again, TOTALLY AWESOME, best pure action movie since the era of the original.

0345803493|1.0|I started reading 50 shades of grey during a long day of flying and I will admit that first I was interested and it got me a little flustered. By the time I was nearing the end of the book I found the characters highly annoying, the sex scenes extremely redundant and overall poorly written. I did buy the second book because I figured if so many people had read it and loved it then it would all get better.... wrong, its even more annoying and redundant then before.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was one of those books that starts off good, then quickly becomes an obsession.  I hated having to stop reading it to tend to other things, like....fixing dinner, eating, going to an appointment, etc.  I love books that get into my mind and that I can't figure out what's going to happen 1/2 way through.  Just when I thought I knew what was going on BAM! it changed.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers before me, I wasn't thrilled with the ending.  But I sort of felt like it left in open to write a sequel or something.  At least I HOPE that's what the author was planning when she ended it the way that she did.<br /><br />The dialogue in this book was outstanding.  Not that it was flowery, deep, poetic prose or anything, but that I could completely imagine the tone of voice the character was using when he or she was speaking, the quirky little phrases, the \\"voice in the head\\" (that everyone has) dialogue with him/herself - it was spot on perfect.  The dialogue, along with the clever and unpredictable plot made this one of the most thrilling books I've read this summer (and I've read 65 books so far since June, so that's saying something!)<br /><br />If you're looking for a creepy \\"mess with your mind\\" kind of story that will remind you of a mix between Alfred Hitchcock with a bit of crazy thrown in, you will love this book.
B00005R24K|5.0|Some People tend to forget this is about DEMONS possessing people... Instead they are called zombies and treated exactly like zombies, as soulless, brainless dead beings that don't torture or torment.... Unlike these Demons! These badass demons don't only possess, they drive people to the brink of insanity... just look at Bruce's character (Ash) he was a coward until he stopped be a wimp and realized that he had to take action and fast.<br /><br />Plot: Five friends go to a cabin in the woods but soon they disturb some demons by playing a recording that has an evil spell that unleashes these crafty and soul-seeking demons that will stop at nothing to cause pain, torment and in some instances relief but only until their victim's guard is down.... now five becomes four and then three and so on and so forth... who will survive the Atmospheric, Disturbing, and Dark Night of Unholy Terror!<br /><br />Review: It's so unoriginal.... but the way it was done cries out that it is original. Everything from the way they maneuvered the camera and the angles that were shot perfectly... to the dated yet modern special effects that are almost as painful to watch as they were a little over thirty years ago. Bruce Campbell I'll admit wasn't as good in this one as he was in part two or three but if you watch the documentaries then you'll probably know why... even Eli Roth says in a brief description that before he has his actors perform he has them watch THE EVIL DEAD and tells them to imagine how hard and sticky it was for Bruce Campbell to do all his own stunts to the point of him becoming a blood target for these menacing monsters. The movie itself has what I like to call a genuine white walls, black backgrounds atmosphere which means that the house itself (or in this case, the cabin) is gritty and has a raw feel to it and when the camera moves a certain way you are only looking at that one object and everything else is black because of how hideous or deformed that one object's appearance is. It happened in films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and in my Opinion a low-budget independent film titled Dark Harvest.... The object in this movie is the gore.... and by god are the bloody dismemberments graphic as all hell. This movie (as much as it is gory) is not hilarious by any means.... it just has incredibly morbid and dark humor to the point where it actually starts to creep you out. This is a B-Movie but it is one of the Best damn B-Movies ever made and it has ranked upon my top three pure horror films from before the 90's the other two are The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist for the time being but there are still plenty of 1970-1989 horror flicks that I haven't seen and I for one know that terror will always be better when it is done in three ways.. To the extreme, to the intensity level that turns beds into lemonade stands all the way to B-Movie Fun!<br /><br />Acting: Superb... it was an 80's movie so most movies of the era were acted cheesy but it worked and it did a damn fine job controlling its cheesiness and it was even modernly acted in some scenes that were done just right, no complaints here!<br /><br />Gore: Bloody dismemberments, decomposing bodies (great stop animation by the way), a graphic body hacking scene, gory gun shots, a groovy decapitation, a disturbing yet gruesome eye gouging, a painful looking pencil stab in the heal scene.... and plenty more... this one will not let gore hounds down!<br /><br />Bottom Line: One of The best movie it's kind and this movie acts as a lot of things, a suspenseful thriller, a gorefest, a black humored and disturbing thrill seeker, and a rollercoaster ride that makes you think it is close to over when the nightmare has just begun!<br /><br />Suggested MPPA Rating: strong graphic horror violence and gore, disturbing images, terror, language, a rape, and parcel nudity<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5

0143039482|5.0|This novel of the financial struggle of one man's family was written in the late 1950's, but it is even more relevant today as it details the Hawley family, once a pillar of society in their Long Island community.  But now the family's breadwinner is reduced in status to a grocery clerk: sweeping floors, stocking shelves, waiting on impatient customers, while he attempts to feed his family of four.  It is hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck.  In a town rife with corrupt politicians, bankers, businessmen, and citizens, Ethan struggles to maintain his honesty as he sees others become rich through dishonest means.  He decides to abandon his honesty policy and puts several plans of action into motion:  taking a bribe, ratting out the store's owner to the Department of Immigration, taking advantage of an alcoholic boyhood best friend, and robbing a bank are all on his agenda.  At the same time, his young son wins a national writing honor, which turns out to be based on plagiarism.  Ethan, feeling his own dishonest plans corrupted his son, then considers suicide.  The economic woes of the family are mirrored by today's stressful times.  Steinbeck has laced his story with rich characters and detail.  This is Steinbeck's last of sixteen novels.  Quite a few, such as \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Cannery Row,\\" deal with the human struggle to survive. He's an expert at depicting this battle. The title is taken from the first two lines of Shakespeare's \\"Richard III.\\"

0765316994|1.0|My review is mainly written for people who are interested in this author, John Scalzi.<br /><br />Stay away from Redshirts and read the Old Man's War series instead.<br /><br />I had difficulty believing this was the same author who produced such wonderful and insightful science fiction.<br /><br />Redshirts is one of those books where you slog through thinking, it has to get better.<br />It doesn't.<br /><br />Scalzi's other work is for the most part excellent.<br /><br />In any line of work, we all blow it once in a while. Most authors don't have even one OMW in them, let alone two.<br /><br />But, with this in mind, a word to all of the parties mentioned in the acknowledgement: please be honest with the author when required. I have to assume that somebody on that list would have seen that this would make a really fun twelve page short story and would be completely unworkable in novel length. Editors, you're not doing your job by releasing this into the light of day under the name of an otherwise fine writer.
0316743003|4.0|This is a phenomenal book, and I want to stress that the few criticisms I'm going to offer should not dissuade people from picking this up and reading it. With help from co-writer Leo Janos, Ben Rich has written a fascinating account of one of the most secretive and successful \\"black projects\\" outfits in American military history.<br /><br />Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works\\" was responsible for developing the P-38, but its real fame began to build as it concentrated on spy planes during the Cold War, specifically the U2 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Rich's account of the conception, construction and deployment of these two iconic aircraft is absolutely ... well, pun intended here ... RIVETING. The narrative is exciting; how could it not be? Here you had a secretive division of a major aeronautical contractor working on planes that would change the course of world history, and this division was facing deadlines, problems with materials, difficulties in coming up with new construction methods, and on and on. The Blackbird's use of titanium alone proved a major engineering hurdle, given how difficult that metal is to work with, but Skunk Works pulled it off...and the Blackbird remains the FASTEST air-breathing aircraft ever constructed, years after its retirement!<br /><br />Two brief criticisms: One, the \\"other voices\\" interludes sometimes break up the narrative flow a bit too much. But Rich being what he was -- the second leader of a highly complex organization -- would naturally feel drawn to this kind of structure, in which value is placed on multiple viewpoints. Two, and I can't believe I'm writing this: Most books, if length is a problem, suffer from being too long. With \\"Skunk Works,\\" I was hoping it would last even longer. Again, though, the book's concision is indicative of its author's personality; Rich was a \\"get it done\\" kind of guy who belied the image of a greedy contractor stretching out a project for as long as possible. Skunk Works prided itself on making or even beating deadlines, and thus Rich the author wasn't going to write a bloated book.<br /><br />This is just a terrific read, especially for anyone interested in how successful organizations of any kind work, how America truly did win the Cold War, and how complexity challenges people with creative minds.ating deadlines, and thus Rich the author wasn't going to write a bloated book.<br /><br />This is just a terrific read, especially for anyone interested in how successful organizations of any kind work, how America truly did win the Cold War, and how complexity challenges people with creative minds.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|First off, the plot of this movie was not good at all. I had trouble understanding who is who in the in the movie and I was expecting a lot more action in the climax of the movie especially when Kronos woke up. It is an okay movie for entertainment and I really liked the graphics played out in this movie. Kronos really looked good and as well as other effects. The director who created Harry Potter, did a great job directing/producing this movie. Since I watch Harry Potter, I noticed little effects like the Satire in the movie that looks like it could come from the Harry Potter Series. Otherwise, I was just was not feeling the plot of the story. I could assume the girl in the movie was Athena, or was she Athena? I mean, what is a good Greek God movie without Athena?<br /><br />I just wish that the plot was a lot more interesting and not to mention little bit educational so that people can be entertained by whatever story the movie is going to show. This movie seems as though the audience knows who were the Greek gods. Luckily, I did, but others might not. In addition, would it be nice to include other Titans too? It would become a five star movie if it included other Titans such as Gaia, and would actually match up with the movie title, \\"Wrath of the Titans.\\"
0439023521|5.0|I read both Harry Potter and the Twilight series. The Twilight series was very tween to me and the Harry Potter series was pretty good when I was younger. This book is nothing like those two. It's definitely better. If you watched the movie and you liked it, you'll like the book much more!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While well written, I think the trilogy could have been better served as a two book series. Getting to Christian's baggage sooner, The explicit sex got a little boring after awhile. But... over all I enjoyed the three as a whole!

B003U69IX6|3.0|I find this movie to be a lot more humorous than entertaining. Brand T. Jackson, who played as Grover kept the movie entertaining. I have to say, if he was not in the movie, then this movie would become a lot more entertaining or even worst not even as 'cool\\" as it is right now. The movie itself is okay, it had a great plot, but then again I expected more at the end and also at the beginning. Not to mention, I noticed that the beginning did not make sense because why couldn't the gods just meet up in Olympus versus in New York City at the top of the Empire State Building?<br /><br />To make this even more humorous, the underworld (hell) is located in Hollywood! Hmm, what message does that give that give to audience? Obviously someone is trying to put down Hollywood. Otherwise, its an okay movie to watch, you will be laughing a lot versus being oooed and aahhhed.<br /><br />Not to mention, I'm surprised Uma Thurman was Medusa in this movie. Where you guys surprise too? I guess because she had the perfect figure and I wonder, if she does comes back as Medusa as a stand alone movie, it will be exciting and entertaining and something that I would look forward to watch. Not mention, I got lost of where that lady came from when she took Annebeth (Athena's daughter)...

However, I feel the need to express my utter revulsion for this over-hyped trilogy because I finally discovered my final line of tolerance for double, triple crap books. This is only the second time IN YEARS that I wish a zero-star rating was possible.<br /><br />In a nutshell: I will never understand how, and why it would take a whole book for Ana Steele to figure out that Christian Grey is after all a control freak and a psycho. I thought it had been obvious all along but apparently his ridiculously beautiful face is enough to make her stay and do all the things she's told. Some love, huh.<br /><br />Now of course, there are a lot more things I would like to point out but I'd have those out another time.
B008133DO8|5.0|\\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" is one of the finest 90 minutes of television I have ever seen.  Twists and turns every few moments!

B0073XV2W2|4.0|Who knows what really goes on in the halls of government, or behind closed doors of those contractors who build all the toys that keep us safe from the latest boogeyman? Suarez has a vivid, and I assume informed imagination that supplies answers to some of these questions. Readers who've read his earlier Daemon and Freedom books will find a lot to like here. The gadgets are only slightly in the future, and maybe even a bit more plausible than the plot devices used in the Daemon/Freedom work.<br /><br />I enjoyed Suarez's Daemon/Freedom and this latest effort, though I enjoyed Daemon/Freedom a bit more, though I can't say exactly why. It may be because this work is a bit more formulaic than his earlier work.<br /><br />The writing makes for easy reading. There's not as much expository philosophy here as in the earlier books. The message is delivered by the action and the outcome.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I had a hard time even giving this 1 star. Lay all the porn aside and this was the worst written book I've ever read. Actually, the porn didn't even give it a fighting chance. By time you get to the 3rd book,  the sex is so predictable it isn't even worth reading about. The entire trilogy is so repetitive that had it been decently edited, it would have saved millions of women $20 and been only one book. I wish I hadn't succumbed to the hype and wasted $30!

0804115613|5.0|I watched the movie Fried Green Tomatoes over and over as a 12 year old girl and loved it. Took me until I was 30 to finally pick up the book and it far outshines the film.<br /><br />Excellent character development, beautifully written, better ending than the movie. I enjoyed the fact that the Idgie/Ruth relationship was more developed and the Evelyn/Ninny relationship was more in depth than the movie as well. The recipes at the end were a bonus (and I make beans just like Sipsey! Reckon that means I am an acceptable southern cook!)<br /><br />Some reviewers had issue with the jumps in time, but I felt they were fantastic and allowed me to read almost as Evelyn was experiencing the stories--bits at a time. Overall just excellent and uplifting. While I love southern literature, some classics leave you feeling grimy (because they should; Tobacco Road is not supposed to leave you feeling like running a marathon) but this was just a good, happy read.
B007SGM084|2.0|I had a real hard time with this being believable.Ok, I'll try to be open minded. It's fantasy and romance.I'm not sure I want to read someone else's fantasy when it involves perversion and pain. I was creeped out the whole time, obsessed with why Christian Grey was that way but could not bring myself to read more than 1/2 of the book let alone the other 2 I purchased. I've never considered myself a prude but this was porn without the crude slang terminology. Not sure that that makes it any better. I'm also a little afraid that women will again be mislead by this and be dissatisfied with their lives in the realm of reality. We tend to forget that that is where we must live. I was influenced by all the hubbub surrounding it and I caved! Should have read the reviews first, lesson learned. I read them after and at least felt a bit validated for my opinion. So that's it.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|There is nothing beautiful about this disaster. It's about a dysfunctional relationship involving with emotional blackmail.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|Great little device. My MP3 player's volumn control runs from numbers 1 through 30, and I have to use settings 29 or 30 when using at home. That meant no use at all in an older car. Now using level 25 or 26 at home, and 28 or 29 while driving.<br /><br />The equalizer functions greatly improve sound quality<br /><br />I haven't timed battery life, but it is well over four hours, which is more than adequate. Charger not included, but my Sony MP3 charger does work. As a matter of logistics, one can only wish the charging cables would interchange. They don't.<br /><br />The switch that controls on/off and equalizer functions takes lots of practice before becoming \\"intuitive\\". Why not read the instructions, you might ask. Well, understanding each word is not the same as understanding an entire sentence, and these instructions might have been produced by some sort of random word generator, like pulling entire words out of a Bingo machine.

B002L4QP0M|5.0|There is a certain formula to a type of political spy thriller, and it goes like this.  Nice, naive (usually rich and handsome) guy gets himself entangled in a major international conspiracy.  Everyone, including his own Government, tries to kill him, but with luck, pluck, and some help from unlikely allies (one of whom *must* be a gorgeous woman), he survives, beats all obstacles, and saves the world.<br /><br />In this book, while we can see the skeleton of the formula ...those bones are magnificently covered, and what could be just another spy thriller of the type made famous (or infamous, depending on your preferences) by Robert Ludlum becomes a vibrant, unique and entirely readable spy thriller that combines action on all levels, with characters you can believe, in a setting that some readers will remember.<br /><br />to begin with, the main character, though nice and good looking, isn't rich.  He also has a skill set that makes his actions and daring-do very believable.  Sure, he learns some things as he goes, but he has the basic combat and survival skills he will need, and, right from the beginning, we know how he obtained them.  In addition, though, he is a very decent and honorable person, and while he gets himself entangled in a whee of a mess, he gets out of it with as much brain power as hand to hand combat skills.<br /><br />The setting is the cold war era ...and, like John Le Carre, the author has a fine understanding of that particularly paranoid part of modern history, and presents it accurately and with just enough detail to make it entirely credible.  All of the major factions are represented beautifully, and it is easy to just slip back in time to those days when nobody trusted anybody, and usually for very good reasons.<br /><br />As always, the writing is crisp and straightforward.  The author has a story to tell, and the command of language to tell it with grace and finesse.<br /><br />It so happens that I love such books, so I tend to be critical of them.  John Le Carre is my personal bench mark ...and Jeffrey Archer definitely reaches it, in this novel.  In fact, while reading it, I felt as though I was enjoying the best of John Le Carre and Ian Fleming, all in one delightful package.ical of them.

B005GP7F8Y|1.0|When I purchased this \\"restored\\" print on Blu-Ray, I took it for granted that Paramount had finally deigned to present this knockout Western in its anamorphic splendor. Well, surprise, surprise, when the DVD Copywright Warnings come on, they're in German!. Then the Main Menu comes on and you have to go to Set-UP and select English, or the default track you'll hear is in the German Language! Then the movie comes on and there's a scratch running down screen right during the Paramount Studio Logo and the VistaVision logo is completely missing! Then for the clincher: the Main Title Sequence and all Establishing Titles during the flik are in - French!<br /><br />The print itself is sharp, but that's about its only virtue. The color is quite pale and the dark scenes are milky. I had a one-dollar bargain DVD that I purchased at Wal-Mart 6 years ago that, though not anamorphic, was Widescreen Letterboxed, and it was a mouthwatering Technicolor print, probably struck from the Laserdisc version. Unfortunately, I threw it away when I ordered this blu-ray rip-off.<br /><br />There's NO indication anywhere in the packaging that this is an cheap Import, nor that is is NOT an official Studio release. So, buyers, STAY AWAY from this! It is a total GYP! Let's hope Paramount does this masterpiece justice in the not too distant future. Olive Films, are you reading me? H-E-E-E-E-E-LP!
0345803485|5.0|Well written!  Excellent story, phenominal womens erotica! Once you read Fifty Shades you have to read the other two and complete the trilogy!
B005LTDPJI|5.0|What a deal! Eleven remastered albums all with bonus tracks and the CD sleeves are reproductions of the original album covers. ELO is one of my favorite 70s bands, and the booklet notes by Jeff Lynne, while not extensive, are really interesting. The sound is also very good, certainly better than some of my original CDs.<br /><br />I ordered a new import copy from one the UK sellers in the Marketplace for a total price with shipping of just under $34. They sent it airmail and it arrived a little more than a week after I ordered it. That's less than $4 per album!

B005LMEB8E|5.0|I really like this album, I mainly know Demi as Sonny on the Disney show that my kids watched.  My husband and I used to say that Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez had some really good voices, in fact, we even started to buy a couple of singles after hearing them on the Disney Channel because they were enjoyable for all of us. I heard one of the songs on the radio and I was thinking that sounds like a grown up Demi, just to find out it that it this is a song on grown up Demi Lovato's album, I was like \\"What.\\"  I have to say that I am really proud of her (I watched her from my kitchen via Disney channel for several years) for overcoming whatever she was going through and producing such as high quality album using that high quality voice. Good job Demi.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enzo is keen, observant, loyal and knows more than you might give him credit for. After all, he is a dog, but not just any dog. Garth Stein writes a captivating novel from the perspective of a dog with a curious name. Have you ever wondered what and how your canine thinks? While I'm not a dog person, I'm very passionate about european cars. The beauty of this story is that you do not have to be an affectionado of either cars or animals to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />Enzo and the supporting characters each have a role in how Denny deals with obstacles. This book is dear to my heart as I traveled the road of cancer with my son during the time I read this book. Enzo chronicles his life from a puppy to the time of his death and beyond. If Enzo had thumbs and could talk he would be perfect. He offers his insight and thoughts as Denny undergoes  serious life challenges. The depth of this book spans intriguing  interrelational  issues among in-laws, family, and friends. As a reader, you cannot help but become part of the story and take on Enzo's role.<br /><br />One reason this is such a great book is because Stein illustrates how ordinary people deal with extraordinary issues in their lives. Most of us have a story to tell. The pages speed by as you need to know what happens next. This was and is a great book. It is a fact that Patrick Dempsey has bought the rights of the screenplay. The actor has had difficulty transitioning the book to a movie. Once you read the book I think you will understand the creative difficulty.<br /><br />~S

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Sophia, the protagonist, is a Wiccan. Her mother is a fundamentalist Christian. Her mother's church wants to evict Sophia from the house she inherited, and reclaim it \\"for the Lord\\". If that's not conflict and tension, I don't know what is.<br /><br />This is the basic setup of her life as Chapter One begins. And THEN the paranormal trouble starts!<br /><br />The vampire origin back story is very original (I won't spoil it). Few stories in any genre feature a first-person viewpoint of a modern Wiccan, based on realistic practices (as opposed to a supernatural witch). It's even braver to have her use dark magic as a justified defense, rather than try to white-magic-wash Wicca, as other authors may have chosen, had they written this.<br /><br />Having lived fairly close to Castle Rock, Colorado for four decades now, I do have to state there's no real Club Flesh (sorry!), and no \\"Denver - 30 miles\\" sign. The city of Denver proper is indeed that distance, but you'll run into the densely-populated south suburbs way before then. And Rebecca missed an opportunity to have some of the action occur on the nearby Devil's Head Lookout hiking trail (the summit of Devil's Head mountain can be seen from the town).<br /><br />If there was any justice in the world, this book would make Castle Rock, Colorado the new Forks.<br /><br />Daven Anderson<br />[[ASIN:B00AMSLI2Y Vampire Syndrome (Erotica)]]
0345803485|1.0|This book was one of the worst I read, wish I hadn't wasted my time.  Kept thinking it would get past the truly boring repetitious sex scenes, but it never did.  This writer has no plot or interesting thing to show that this was written by an adult or even a true writer.  It was so juvenile and so poorly written.  Actually, it was quite funny by the time I finished because of the stupidity.  Thanks for nothing.  You are only getting sales for the lurid parts of this book, which are on every page.  Since we all have only a certain allotted time on earth, I'm not going to waste mine reading the next two.<br /><br />Guess I was required to rate it something in order to post, but would have given it nothing.

At first it seemed a second rate nothing of a film and i almost turned<br />it off.  Then it got better, and better, and the ending is way out funny and even the wife loved<br />it.  So i'd say, give it a shot... I for one will buy a copy for my collection.
B000OJFV3S|1.0|I really loved the idea of this show because I love period dramas, the costumes, the dialogue...but this was awful. It also seemed like Showtime took the soft core porn agle to the limits here. When you have amazing shows like Downton Abbey it really puts you off of highly produced and over stylized shows like this.

While the transitions and video edits are a bit too quick (editor should have held most of the sequences a bit longer), the sound is incredible.  And as always, the Eagles deliver way above expectations, playing a lot of the older stuff, but a lot of new songs too, allowing each of the band members to highlight their individual talents.  I highly recommend this for past, present and future Eagles fans.  This one is sure to bring a whole new flock of fans into the fold!

No way.  Fortunately, I kept reading, and the story of life before and after one of those possessive type boyfriends completely drew me in.  I was very surprised to find out this is the author's first novel; the characters are so well drawn, and the story is suspensefull and compelling.  ( I was so creeped out, I admit to sleeping with the lights on one night!)  Does the author have OCD?  She does a magnifient job of getting inside the head of her main character.  It was a long book, and I was sorry when it was over.

B000059TEQ|5.0|I read Love Story (Segal, 1970) the first time after watching the movie in the summer of 1970.  I have read this book various times throughout my lifetime.  The story has been called a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, but it goes deeper than that.  The plot of the story addresses social differences in the American society, family pressure, and expectations.  The characters are very unconventional and the story structure is not traditional.  These characteristics make the story interesting and touching.<br />The characters and the plot interweave.  The characters come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Oliver Barrett IV comes from high society and from a very wealthy family whose members are Harvard alumnae.  The family even donated the Barrett Hall to the University. Jennifer Cavilleri comes from a collar worker family; her father owes a small bakery.  Oliver's family is from Ipswich, Massachusetts and Jennifer's family is from Cranston, Rhode Island.  Jennifer attends Radcliff College under a scholarship. Oliver attends Harvard.  When they meet their attraction is strong and mutual (p. 2).  Their friendship develops and they fall in love. Oliver's family is very competitive and expects him to go to Law School, take over the family business, and marry someone in their same social level.  His father is a banker, landlord, and business owner.  Jennifer's father just wants his daughter to be happy.  He does not pressure his daughter at all.  She has no mother since she died when Jennifer was a child.  Their social gap becomes evident when they visit each other's home.  Oliver's parents are cold toward their own son and they treat Jennifer cordial but cold.  Jennifer's father is a down-to-earth niece guy.  Oliver's home is a huge state. Jennifer's home is a humble working class adobe in a row of street houses, with no extra land.  Their difference in social status could not be any larger.  Their love is stronger than Oliver's parents' prejudice.  Jennifer receives a scholarship to study music in Paris, France and Oliver proposes.  They marry.  Oliver is disinherited by his father for marrying Jennifer and by doing so, defying his father.<br />It is interesting how the first sentence of the book opens with the climax of the story, in the form of a question: What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old-girl who died?\\" (p. 1).  Even though the climax is given out on the first sentence of the book, a complete unconventional approach to traditional story structure, this \\"preview\\" that might have been considered a spoiler made the reader's curiosity grow.  The readers want to find out how and why this young life extinguishes. The whole story is a flashback that takes us to the day these two young lovers meet in Radcliff College Library.  The story moves through defined chapters and takes us through their courtship, marriage, Oliver's Law School, working summers in Massachusetts shore, Oliver's graduation from Law School, Oliver's law firm job, and their big move to New York City.  Toward the end of the story Jennifer is diagnosed with leukemia and that is the reason why she can't conceive.  Oliver is devastated and ridden with guilt.  Oliver buys airline tickets for Paris, but Jennifer states that is not the way they are going to approach her disease and her final days.<br />This book was a success by the way the plot addressed social issues that were not openly discussed and were not well known by the general public, unless the reader belonged to the high class society.  The story addresses love and sacrifice. It also shows how family expectations and demands are prioritized over parents love and support for their child.  The characters idiosyncrasy and upbringing plus the story development and structure make a touching and fascinating book.

B002KKCVOG|5.0|This was my second pair of Teva Tanza sandals, and once again, I was extremely pleased.  Indeed, I would say the Tanzas are the best wearing and most comfortable sandals I've ever purchased anywhere, any time.  The man made materials used in their construction hold up to wear and tear much better than the much more expensive leather ones, or the more cheaply made sandals by other manufacturers.  Several features stand out particularly.  First, these sandals run true-to-size, so you can order the size you normally wear and be sure it will fit.  Second, if they get muddy or dirty, simply toss them in the washing machine with mild detergent and warm water, run the cycle, and they come out clean.  Third, the Velcro on these sandals does not wear out in a couple of months like so many others.  And finally, the strap arrangement is both extremely comfortable and secure right from the very first.  Simply adjust the Velcro straps to a comfortable position when you wear them for the first time, and you're good to go.  These are casual, leisure-time footwear, so don't expect them to be suitable for black tie events, but if you're like me, and are simply looking for cool, comfortable footwear for spring, summer, and early fall, you won't be disappointed.  Oh, and one more thing, unlike many sandals, the Tevas provide excellent ergonomic foot support.  You needn't be concerned that they will hurt your feet if you take a walk!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I like reading good books...well-written books. I hate purchasing books for my Kindle Fire and they turn out to be garbage. Thus, my disappointment.  I think the sex scenes were explicit enough to bring about some arousal, however the book is largely redundant. There is nothing sexy about murmuring!<br /><br />Still, I'll probably download the second book just to see if it gets better. I've gotten much more fulfilling experiences from reading Zane's novels.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I've been a GL fan for years & this movie was everything I hoped it would be. It was very entertaining. My girlfriend who is NOT a comic book fan at all loved it, as did her two kids aged 12 & 15. When we left the theater after seeing it for the first time her boy said \\"That was an awesome movie!\\"<br />So don't listen to the negativity of a bunch of nerds who need to get out of their rooms once in awhile and get some fresh air & sunlight. \\"Die hard\\" comic book nerds complain about the Avengers and the Dark Knight movie as well. It just proves you'll never make them happy.
0812993292|5.0|Harold recently retired from a lifetime working at a local brewery.  Forty-five years living in his current house, slightly longer married to his wife.  One son.  As far as the reader, and apparently Harold know, that pretty accurately sums up his life.  And then a letter arrives, return address Berwick-upon-Tweed.  \\"He didn't know anyone in Berwick. He didn't know many people anywhere. `Maybe it's a mistake.'\\"<br /><br />Opening the letter it is from a woman with whom he worked twenty years previously,  It is written from a hospice, and tells him she is dying.  He sits at the breakfast table thinking about this letter.  \\"'Could you pass the jam?' `She was in finances. She was very good.' `That's the marmalade, Harold. Jam is red. If you look at things before you pick them up, you'll find it helps.'<br /><br />We have barely begun the book and we feel Harold's isolation.  His timidity and sadness.  And we are rooting for him.  He just seems too nice for all of this insecurity.  I mean the poor man is at least 65.  Hasn't he figured out how to maneuver through life by now?  Apparently not.  He is flummoxed by this letter, utterly unable to proceed.  \\"What he felt was so big it was difficult to find the words, and even if he could, it was hardly appropriate to write them to someone he had not contacted in twenty years.\\"  But somehow he forces himself to write, though it is a fairly terrible letter in its lack of sincerity.  And Harold is aware of the inadequacy of the letter, or the inadequacy of Harold to do anything, even write this letter.  He picks up his jacket \\"from the peg where Maureen liked him to hang it\\" and goes out to mail the letter at the corner box.<br /><br />Instead he decides to walk to a further box, and then the post office station, and then at some point Harold just keeps walking, and at some point it becomes a pilgrimage to see Queenie, his long-lost friend.  This is pilgrimage with a small p, despite others attempts to sell, steal and ruin thisstraightforward quest by one very ordinary man trying to help a friend.  \\"An impulse to wave came over Harold. He didn't, though. He was wheezing with the effort of walking and he didn't want to cause alarm.\\"  It is the every man aspect of Harold, his quest, and the language of the book that are all pitch perfect and never far from the reader.  I can easily imagine being Harold on his quest, though I fear I am often more Maureen.  And as the book reached its conclusion I sobbed.  Take off the glasses I can't see a thing sobbing.  And then everyone I talked to I beseeched them to read this marvelous book.  I beseech you too.

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Wish the author would have started the trilogy out this way.  I liked this book so much more than the second, though it was still somewhat underdeveloped and unfortunately could not stand alone.  It serves as more of a bridge between the first and third mostly due to the ending which as abrupt and sort of a cliff hanger.  But I was more interested in the characters this time around.

030758836X|5.0|In Gillian Flynn's brilliant new book Gone Girl we take an exaggerated look at a society obsessed with getting the edge at all costs.  Most of us are flawed, granted, and have experienced feelings of rage, disappointment, second guessing, or confusion within a relationship.  Even hatred and a thirst for revenge if hurt badly enough.  During the roller coaster of a ride into the minds of Amy and Nick, the level of premeditated manipulation and spin control is truly astounding, almost hard to believe.  That's what makes the book so much fun.  We, as readers, can't get a strong foothold on reality.  We are being constantly manipulated.  Just as the sleazy divorce lawyer and the social media pundits manage the TRUTH to their own agenda.  For those who were frustrated by the ending, having the LAST WORD as uttered by Amazing Amy is really the beginning of a new chapter.  And yes, there should have been a more discriminating use of the F word and C word (the overuse of profanity was a slight distraction for me).  But any book that has me laughing out loud, dazzled by the dexterity of the written word, and constantly keeping me guessing and off balance is worthy of the highest rating.  I've read all of Gillian Flynn's books and this is her best.

030788743X|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book, after seeing comments about it on boingboing and on here. The concept looks good as well (\\"Willy Wonka meets The Matrix\\"). With The Matrix being one of my favorite movies and having grown up as a nerd, at first, this book did feel like I was going to enjoy it immensely. It fizzled out completely for me about halfway through.<br /><br />The \\"pop culture references\\" are enjoyable, and with loads and loads of them there's enough to enjoy there. I must have missed a bunch and I have not nearly played ALL of the games or worked with all of the computers that are referenced, but the fact that I know at least some of them means I'm part of the target audience. Unfortunately, love of the 80's alone is not enough to carry a book in itself. There's pretty much nothing inventive about the plot or how the story is told. William Gibson ([[ASIN:0441012035 Neuromancer]]) and Neal Stephenson ([[ASIN:344245302X Snow Crash.]]) both did this ten times better, and twenty+ years ago at that. I'm sorry. I can forgive plot holes or a sappy love story as long as there is something else to keep me interested, and there wasn't. As much as I really really want(ed) to love this book, I just couldn't by the time I had finished it, it made me feel like I was reading something written for teenagers.

0345803493|2.0|A friend recommended me to buy these books. I bought the first two and I'm really surprised that this trilogy is on the top 10 lists everywhere and is a best seller. The writing is awful, the repetitions are so many that it is exasperating to read the same again and again, and the childish - moronic way in which Miss Steele express herself and think is just embarrassing. Like I already said on my review of the first book: the whole experience of reading these books is that a teenager wrote it, a teenager lacking writing skills badly. In fact I find way more entertaining to read the reviews of this book here on Amazon that to read the actual book. I been laughing so hard with the fun reviews! I don't think I will buy the third book because honestly is a waste of money. I feel really sorry for all those great writers out there that have books that are worth reading and doesn't have the success this awful book have. Its sad to see that a good concept and interesting characters got totally ruined by such an awful writing.

1400069289|4.0|This book pinpoints the neurological reasons for unconscious habits and describes the \\"habit program\\" we are all born with.  This habit program is then extrapolated through the book as the underlying, though not always intentional, reason for personal, social, and finally societal events and trends.  It also explores how to change habit, though this part of the book is almost an afterthought.  As we all know changing habits takes much more than just reading a book, however the book pinpoints things that might facilitate change. It is well written and very engaging and I look forward to another work by this author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Excellent app _ addictive game you can spent hours playing.  The time challenger is the best one. I would recommend it to anyone, any age. Good, very good indeed.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app lets me know when my kindles battery is getting too low to read. Especially on the weekends I read all day long so if I'm planning to leave and I don't have my charger. I can make sure my kindle is charged before I leave.  Better yet when it gets below 25% I can charge it right away. This is a great app for my kindle.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I did see her TV show, Live at the Royal Albert Hall and totally treated myself to the CD and DVD.  Love it, love it, love it, it's almost like being at the RAH and being part of the happiest, most excited crowd.  Adele is super, phenomenal voice, simple and classy with her stage performance.  So happy I have it, really, just love watching her amazing talent.  I'd hang out with her.

I would really like it. it would help out so much.

0425263908|5.0|I love this book! I found it to be better than the 50 Shades series (although I did love 50 shades). The characters seem to be more like actual real-life people. Also, I like that the author did not repeat herself and use the same adjectives all through the book. She kept it interesting and sucked you in through the entire book. I cannot wait for the sequel to come out in October!!
B005D646RE|5.0|Season 4 of Breaking Bad takes us on a roller coaster of a ride of suspense and drama leaving us with many questions. The Lilllie's of the Valley sitting next to Walter's pool make us wonder if Walter poisoned Brock in an effort to make Jess think Gus did it so Jess would help him eliminate Gus. This makes the transformation of Walter clear. He will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, no matter who he has to hurt. Jess still clings to his humanity and has definite limits to what he will do for money. This story of how circumstances, illness, greed etc. can transform a person is one of the best I have seen, and tells it's story without preaching but by showing the changes that take place.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|The book is quite revealing in its details of battles and the characters involved. It seems a considerable amount of research went into the book. It is very well written.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|After hearing a friend of mine rave about this book for ages, I bought it just before having gum surgery this past week, figuring it'd provide me with some much-needed distraction while I recovered. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before purchasing it. My mistake.<br /><br />It's all been said already, but really, did the world need another book about a perfect, handsome, oh-so-refined and gentlemanly yet totally controlling vampire? Much less the gawky, geeky, ill-dressed woman (though honestly Diana reads much more like a teenage girl than a thirty-something-year-old) that happens to catch his interest because of her intoxicating scent (barf) and the allure that only she doesn't recognize? Please. The only thing that separates this book from Twilight is the fact that Diana is a witch -- and since she doesn't want or use her powers, that's kind of a moot point -- and supposedly has a doctorate and a tenured position at Yale (which she conveniently ignores as soon as Mr. Dreamy sweeps her off her feet.)<br /><br />Then there's the historical details. I read in another review that this is Harkness' first work of fiction, and it shows. Great, so you know a lot about history and art and alchemy and wine. Oh and horses! I'm very glad for you. Now could you maybe use some of those words to create a plot instead of some vague excuse for a love story?<br /><br />I could go on and on. Needless to say, now that the drugs have worn off, I don't think I'll be continuing this book for very much longer. The only thing it accomplished was to make me want to go outside for a run followed by a huge English breakfast and a cup of tea.<br /><br />What a waste of time and money.
0061692042|5.0|It's been said that the The Lay of the Land, the final book in Richard Ford's Ralph Bascombe trilogy, was \\"less successful\\" than the others.  I don't subscribe to that theory; in my view, it's the most successful . . . except for the end.  Which is a big exception.  The climax felt incongruously violent and unnecessary, not unlike Richard Russo's to Empire Falls.  Both felt contrived for Hollywood or something, unworthy of either writer or either work, detracting from the elegant realism that hums through both these great pieces of American literature.<br /><br />Canada makes amends.  In his first stand-alone novel since Wildlife (which also featured a pre-adult protagonist), Ford carries the quiet, multi-layered narration to a climax so clear and unencumbered by the noisy soundtrack and garish visuals even great novelists too often employ, it might be said to stand as a new standard for modern American realism--and as a successful return to the finishing structure of the first novel in Ford's trilogy, The Sportswriter.  There, and again now in Canada, Ford sticks to \\"the heart of things human\\" (to borrow a phrase from early in the novel) right through to the end.<br /><br />The year is 1960, and the scene is Great Falls, Montana.  (A real town which, like Russo's fictional Empire Falls, Maine, is chosen in part for the irony in the name given the story each writer will tell.)  Our protagonist and narrator is Dell Parsons, a rootless, fifteen-year-old boy with a father in the military, a mother who's hostage to circumstances, and a twin sister who's light years ahead of him developmentally.  The general contours of the disaster to come, as we learn on page one, include a bank robbery and murders.  The suspense lies, to some extent, in how these crimes come to be committed; but even more than this, the story is driven by revelations of how these events shape a young man trying to find his way in a young life, and how he sees what is happening to his family.<br /><br />In the closing portions of the novel, the aging narrator who opened the story reflects back on all this from whatever perspective our lives give us.  Wry, dry pearls follow.  Like the first five pages, which feature some of the most keenly observed descriptions of a protagonist's parents in the American canon, these last five pages are worth the price of admission all on their own.<br /><br />In between lies the great American novel of our times./>In the closing portions of the novel, the aging narrator who opened the story reflects back on all this from whatever perspective our lives give us.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After all the talk about this book I had to read it even though I have never read this genre before.  The author was very detailed in the descriptions used. I also like the way she incorporated the character's thoughts.  The development of the characters and love story was great.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I usually read books that focus on murders or physcological thrillers.  When some of my friends talked about this book and how much they loved it I wasn't  interested because it wasn't the genre that i usually read.  oI then noticed more people talking about it (the women at lunch, talk shows, etc) ther people and I thought I would read it to find out what the big deal was.  I loved it because of the love story that developed.
0345803485|3.0|Book 1 is ok,there is chemistry & some kinky sex play between Christian & Ana. She is overly naive, very self centered, & has no appreciation of the fantastic man that Christian is. Even after he spends all of this energy, money & time keeping her safe, repeatedly proving his love, & changing everything about his lifestyle for her, it's not enough. She has endless doubts & insecurities that he loves her, to the point of stupidity, after he has shown his love for her in everything he does. She doesn't want any part of his lifestyle, she expects him to compromise for her & wants \\"more\\". He gives her \\"more\\" & makes many changes & sacrificies for her, but it's still not enough for her. She wants him to be \\"normal\\" & not to engage in his kinky lifestyle, & she wants no part of it. This kills the chemistry, the kinky sex play & the point of reading the book. The ending of book 1 is such a disappointent & so unrealistic.<br /> Ana is beyond naive, she is stupid & jealous of his past lovers that he hasn't been involved with for years. She accuses him of \\"assault & battery\\" & of \\"hitting her\\" because he gave her a spanking. She acts like a total drama queen. I was very disappointed in the playful scene where she runs from him through his house when he threatens to disipline her. That scene falls flat & Ana ruins what could have turned into a fun & erotic scene. After she tells him honestly how she feels about his lifestyle, I don't know what he sees in her or why he stays. I didn't like her, it's frustrating that she stays & tries to competely change this man from who he is, into the vanilla man she wants. It's unrealistic is some of scenes of how she has all these unbelievable orgasms, Jeez, all he does is touch her breasts & she expodes,, totally unrealistic, so fake. I didn't like her charactor at all.<br /> Book 2 didn't grab me, hold my interest & pull me in like the book 1. Gone is the chemistry,killed by Ana's complete resistance, insecurity, stupidity, & total opposition to Christian's lifestyle. She clearly doesn't enjoy participating in any kinky activities that he enjoys. I wondered why this beautiful man keeps wasting his time on her. The book falls completely flat,I didn't finish it, it was a huge disappointent & a total waste of time.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are excellent. Edward Norton may just be the best actor on the planet. So where does this movie go wrong? There are two problems with the latest Bourne entry: The script and the editing. The basic premise of \\"shut the program down\\" meaning \\"kill everyone involved\\" is unoriginal, unimaginative, and basically just plain stupid. Mass murders lead to more congressional probes, more attention, greater risk- not less. Oh, and let's murder all the lab geeks and send a 5 man highly trained hit team in to take out the lone surviving tech. Sure... why not? That sounds like a great way to avert suspicions.<br />  The second problem is the editing. It starts out with promise. The opening scenes are well done, and it felt like \\"Bourne\\" should feel. Tense, highly technical, state of the art and beautifully shot. Later on however, things just bog down. We didn't need to see a bald lab tech taking out everyone in the room- not for 10 minutes. Hey, this guy wasn't Arnold Schwarzenegger- someone should have thrown their pocket calculator at his temple- scene over, everyone's safe! Then it gets good again- the scene at the Doctor's house is once again \\"Bourne\\" like- very well shot, and Renner is just great!<br />  My final gripe- the chase scene in Manilla is another \\"editor gone wild\\"- just awful. You throw about 1,000 \\"cut shots\\" at us in rapid machine gun fashion, and we're supposed to be in awe. No, we're just nauseated. This same mistake was made in the car chase at the end of Bourne 2 in Russia. Rapid cut shots...arrrrrgh!<br />  The set up for a sequel is a good thing. We want to see Aaron Cross and Jason Bourne in the same movie. Bring back Pamela Landy and several other old characters from the Bourne trilogy and it could be fantastic! Please bring back Edward Norton but give him a better script. We want to see him as the grand master, playing a life and death chess match against Pamela, Jason, and Aaron. Can't wait!
B006LSZECO|1.0|After reading over 1/2 the book, i skipped to the last 100 pages to see how it ended, only because I had invested time in reading one of the most boring and unlikeable books I have ever read.  I learned a lesson though.  Always read the sample before ordering.

0812550706|4.0|I like intelligent sci-fi, like 2001: A Space Odyssey or I Robot, not the kind with monsters jumping out at people.  Ender's Game did not disappoint.  I read it at the recommendation of my daughter, Amy, and found it to be imaginative, multifaceted and entertaining.  The author gets an A+ for creativity and plot, although it dragged a bit in the middle, was a little sentimental toward the end and the quality of writing was not on a par with other sci-fi greats.  Still it was gripping and quite worthwhile.<br /><br />This is an iconic classic and has been reviewed to death; mine is but one more voice in the choir of praise.  If you like intelligent sci-fi and have not already done so, join with thousands of others and read Ender's Game.
0385738765|4.0|The Maze was the first test, the second is a burned wasteland known as the Scorch. With time in their enemies' hands the group must travel through the barren desert, or be left to die a searing death. Wicked isn't playing games anymore and so Thomas must be cautious and help his group if he wishes to survive. If the hot temperatures and the wretched natural disasters aren't enough of a challenge for the small group, the flare infested humans will surely finish them off... and so, let the Scorch Trials Begin!<br /><br />  The Scorch Trials had so much to offer. While the novel is considered a dystopian/ Sci-fi, I would consider it a mystery novel as well. It's one of those books where you don't know the identity of the antagonists, you don't know who's trustworthy, you don't know if the antagonist is actually evil. It's a game of guess and you have the main character to help you out!<br /><br />  In the second novel of the series, I enjoyed that Thomas' past was brought to us in short segmented dreams. This encouraged the readers to decipher the clues. It also brought the readers a deeper connection with our main character. I especially enjoyed that the dreams were confusing. I mean confusion is the building blocks for mysteries am I right?!<br /><br />  James Dashner did an excellent job working his characters. His writing is  a great example on how to use only one type of Point of View in order to bring a stronger connection! Usually I enjoy reading both sides of a story but when I only read one I usually feel as if I am the main character, in mind and body. This method is extremely useful to bring readers into a book and not just on the surface but into the depths!<br /><br />  Now, while the Scorch Trials was really fast paced and entertaining, I was disappointed to see that the plot had somewhat changed from its original course. Although, that's what a series is. It's many curves, twists, and loops that creates suspense and emotion. Even if the end result isn't what we expected it still contains that really strong plot that made it enjoyable.<br /><br />  With that said, The Scorch Trialscannot match The Maze Runner yet it's a darn close call because both are filled with great writing, exciting plot, and interesting characters. A definate must-read!what we expected it still contains that really strong plot that made it enjoyable.<br /><br />  With that said, The Scorch Trialscannot match The Maze Runner yet it's a darn close call because both are filled with great writing, exciting plot, and interesting characters.

Just enough to get me hooked. It's fairy tales with a realistic twist told in the modern world, following a central few characters.  I can't wait to see what happens next.

My only complaint is that I also like to connect my mac to a display and with this it's either/or. Not a huge deal since I have WiFi also, but would have been a nice perk. I would love to get this instead ([...]) but it is expected to cost an insane $400!!! So, I chose to just switch if I need to. Not a bad choice though
B003V1WTMM|5.0|The Distant Hours is a very good read.  The characters are interesting and the story line keeps you guessing.  I like the way that there are several stories and a bit of mystery woven in to the larger theme.  Enjoyed this story.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie way back when on VHS.  Bought the new version and still really enjoy it.  The best of the series with Thunderdome a bit behind and the first one waaay back.  Didn't really dig that one.  Gibson did such a great job in these movies... too bad he turned into that freaky dude he is now days.  I would have loved to seem him as an older Max in the fourth movie.
B006T5G73Y|1.0|Overall, this movie is too flattering for J. Edgar Hoover. Many sensitive parts are either not mentioned or whitewashed. His cross-dressing is only alluded very briefly. His homosexuality is made to look sympathetic. (This was an epoch where hidden homosexual were systematically denied any security clearance ! )  His investigations about Martin Luther King are NOT mentioned ! (J. Edgar put listening devices in his hotel room, where he discovered that \\"he was fornicating with a white women.\\" ) When he reported this investigation to his boss Robert Kennedy ( attorney general), he was ordered to close all this garbage of investigation. Not only he did not close the investigation but he run files on Robert Kennedy and on his older brother, the President, recording all his \\"infidelities\\". None of this Kennedy business is even mentioned in the movie.  Overall, I feel that Clint Eastwood, compromised on his principles to direct a movie like that. There are other movies on the subject that are much more complete than this one.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a nice family movie.  I miss movies like this where I don't have to tell the kids to cover their eyes.  It was entertaining and interesting.  Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors and as usual he delivers.  This movie is one for the family library.

Disc One consists of Slipknot's best songs ever recorded, including songs from their 1999 self-titled album, Iowa, Vol. 3 and All Hope Is Gone. Also includes a remix of My Plague and live versions of The Heretic Anthem and Purity from their Disasterpieces DVD. Disc Two contains audio of the band's entire performance at the Download Festival in 2009. The second disc alone is worth the purchase. This is an album any Slipknot fan should get their hands on.

I believe the two young girls/women complimented each other to tell their sides of the story. In the discussion with the author, she hinted about the possibility of a sequel of sorts. I hope this could be true. I would definitely ready it.<br />I have to mention that I appreciated reading a book that was not littered with racey scenes and foul language. As a christian, I can safely recommend this book to my friends. If you are interested in historic fiction, this is a wonderful story.

Wow!!!! I would highly recommend this backpack. I was using a Canon bag not anymore! No wonder my neck hurt after a shoot (carried on shoulder), and it was harder to find equipment.<br />THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!
0439023491|4.0|The sequel to The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, is pretty typical of a middle of a series novel.  There's just enough action to pull you in and keep you entertained, but at the same time, it's pretty predictable and somewhat disappointing. Although not as fast-paced as its prequel, the transitions in the storylines were smooth and kept the momentum of the story moving forward.<br />The main characters are described with such depth, that when the Capitol tortures and disgraces them, you feel pain for a friend, not a mere character.  The new characters were introduced well, however, there were so many insignificant ones it was hard sorting out their function in the novel. Many main characters failed to develop in this novel. The other contestants in the Quell seem to be accessories to the book, Gale is little more than a thought in this supposed love triangle, and Katness herself had very little growth...except for her selfishness and whining. Peeta, nothing more than a schmuck of a contestant in The Hunger Games grew into a noble and kind person, and is constantly Katness' savior. He is the kind of person that could actually rally the Districts and lead a rebellion. Haymitch, though drunk on several occasions, turns into a real person...with feelings. He motivates Katness and Peeta into training for the Quell, with the realization that of the three of them, either he or Peeta will have to fight Katness in the arena, and at least one, if not both of them, will die. He becomes such a likable character, that you're torn between hoping they draw Peeta's name or Haymitch's.<br />The story lines are engrossing. Katness seems oblivious to the hope she so willingly handed out to the districts in The Hunger Games when she offered Peeta the berries that would end both their lives and deny the Capitol a winner in their games. This upset the Capitol because their hand was forced and they were made fools of, but also rallied the Districts in the hopes of a rebellion. Then there is also the tantalizing realization that perhaps District 13 still exists, which offers even more hope for a successful rebellion. The downfall is that the Districts are so spread out; there cannot be a collective uprising.<br />The Districts are looking for a leader to overthrow the Capitol and regain their freedoms. Katness finally figures out during the Victory Tour that she, herself, has become their mockingjay, their symbol of hope, and finds herself struggling with the weight of what that implication entails. Meanwhile, the Capitol is making plans for Quarter-Quell, which they hope will eliminate Katness once and for all.<br />The Quarter-Quell itself is very disappointing. It's so over-the-top that it was not believable in the way The Hunger Games arena battle was. This time though, the Games are with seasoned vets, not innocent, scared children. Everything was thrown into this arena: lightening, blood rain, poisonous fog, Killer Mutt monkeys, tsunamis, even jabberjays.  There are plenty of gruesome twists and turns, but overall, the theme is basically the same: survival of the fittest... almost. It becomes cheesy when you realize that everyone is valiantly protecting Peeta and Katness though, for whatever reason.<br />The ending is rather abrupt and has little closure for the story, making it quite clear that there is a next installment.  There are as many unanswered questions at the end of this as answered. What about the love triangle? Gale is reintroduced while the Capitol has Peeta, now there's no district 12, but definitely a District 13...why?<br />Overall, this was a well-paced read. There were no times of dragging, but there were moments where your head was left reeling. It really was quite riveting, even though a bit repetitious of The Hunger Games. This book, the bridge, did exactly as it should. It reflected on the prequel and set the scene for the final segment.also the tantalizing realization that perhaps District 13 still exists, which offers even more hope for a successful rebellion. The downfall is that the Districts are so spread out; there cannot be a collective uprising.<br />The Districts are looking for a leader to overthrow the Capitol and regain their freedoms. Katness finally figures out during the Victory Tour that she, herself, has become their mockingjay, their symbol of hope, and finds herself struggling with the weight of what that implication entails. Meanwhile, the Capitol is making plans for Quarter-Quell, which they hope will eliminate Katness once and for all.<br />The Quarter-Quell itself is very disappointing. It's so over-the-top that it was not believable in the way The Hunger Games arena battle was. This time though, the Games are with seasoned vets, not innocent, scared children.

030758836X|5.0|As mentioned in an earlier review \\"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even when it made me itchy and twitchy and feel uncomfortably exposed.\\"  So much so that after I read the first third I put it down for several days.  I couldn't stop thinking about what I'd read so I had go back and finish it and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I didn't want to think that there are Nick and Amy relationships in the real world -- but the more I consider it the more I believe there are.<br /><br />P.S.  New York and Missouri as described by Ms. Flynn?  Ouch.  Think maybe I'd move to a sunnier and happier place -- maybe Portland.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I truely enjoyed the book and was engulfed in it. Didn't want to stop reading. You become part of the story and want to know what happens next. Had to have the next book ready when I finished this one. Couldn't wait to read more. Loved it!!!
034580404X|5.0|If you're looking to buy, get all 3 at once because as soon as you finish 1 you'll be waiting more. They will have you laughing, crying and sitting on the edge of your seat in suspense. It's a fantastic love story and yes there's lots of vividly told sex scenes but anyone buying these books should already know this. I do feel as much as I loved these books-I read all 3 in 5 days, that she could have easily made 4 or 5 in the series as I felt the last book was a little rushed and a few things wasn't wrapped up, like the Jack storyline and it basically skimmed over 2 years. Overall, I loved them and can't wait to see what her next novels are about. I hope they are as good as these.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are cool but it doesn't give you any instructions so you lose every time till you figure it out!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|exactly what I wanted, delivered promptly.  very happy with my purchase and back to reading by kindle. I would not hesitate to use Amazon again.
1469984202|4.0|I bought the Kindle Edition of this book because a friend, with whom my tastes often align, mentioned it on Twitter. I finished the book this morning and did not read any reviews until this morning. I figured I'd add my two cents:<br /><br />I liked the stories - a lot. The writing style is distinct and, I feel, nicely complements the character development and pace of the plot. I admire the way the plot is developed. The first story is \\"pregnant\\" and, in my opinion, well-developed in subsequent volumes. I just purchased the sixth book and look forward to reading the continuing saga!<br /><br />:{>
0312117337|5.0|This is by far my favorite deck in terms of both imagery and quality of readings.<br /><br />I am very grateful to have purchased this deck right before it was discontinued. I highly recommend anyone able to get this deck at a reasonable price... get it!<br /><br />Let me explain... if you do a google image search for this deck, you can see the amazing imagery. There's so much symbolism, quality, and just overall imagination in these pictures. My favorite tarot imagery I've seen so far in a deck.<br /><br />Second, the readings from this deck are super accurate and full of insight. Especially if you approach spirituality from a meditative standpoint. The book is lengthy, detailed, and does a great job at giving insight from the cards.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the cards I received in my purchase are a bit flimsy compared to my other decks. I like firm cards and these are bit on the lighter side. Card stock could change from supplier though.<br /><br />Overall I would have given this deck an additional star if I could. Just stunningly beautiful and insightful. Highly recommended for all Tarot users.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|So I've seen this film in theater and at home, and I have to say, it just does not get old. I keep wanting to watch it every second I get! So to truly review the film, or just a quick one cause we all have lives here, let's go!<br /><br />Cinematography is brilliant. It completely fits the mysterious nature of our almost mute protagonist and lends a much darker feel, accentuating the drama. Music is super swell as well -- retro synth paired with what seems like an original composition adds a fast-paced, thrill-seeking atmosphere.<br /><br />The actors are brilliant of course. Ryan Gosling nails being this guy who is totally in his own right as not someone who wants to talk a lot but everyone finds it awkward. We see moments of care twinkling in his eye. He's not completely cold-hearted! I wasn't too crazy about Carey Mulligan's representation of her role and think there were probably more fitting actresses for the role, but that's me. Of course Bryan Cranston was amazing. With the exception of Mulligan, I found everyone great.<br /><br />Storyline is simple and convoluted at the same time. Nothing particularly difficult to follow, but trying to retell the story makes you think twice.<br /><br />I'm not much of a reviewer because I have too many opinions and think too fast and type too slow, so this is about as much of a review you'll get. Watch Drive...you won't regret it.
0143143492|5.0|For my now, I find \\"A New Earth\\" extremely helpful as I am life.  I bought the CD and listen to it while doing dishes and cooking.  Echkart's teachings help me to open doors to more possibilities.  Being human we want more and that is not to be judged but I am finding more as I work with the inner realm as well.
B007Y5IAV0|2.0|This album is very very very boring, it was good for all of one listen but then I started really listening to the lyrics and then I was just shocked at how poor they are. This is definitely something for people who are already fans of Serj's music. It also is a singles album, a lot, and I mean A LOT, of filler can be found on the album. To top it all off the singles don't match the quality or catchiness of SOAD. Overall, only get this album it you have a ton of friends who like his music or if you personally love his other works.
0375869026|5.0|This book has received a lot of praise this year, even many predictions as to its award-winning possibilities. I am not going to dispute that possibility because I wholeheartedly agree with all the hype. I loved this book.  I loved Auggie and his courage in facing public school for the first time. The courage it took for his parents to send him to public school knowing he would likely face poor treatment by some. Auggie's sister's struggles with feeling overlooked and wanting attention for her own abilities and concerns rather than receiving attention simply for being Auggie's sister. The format of the story (multiple viewpoints) gives the reader more depth as far as what other people are thinking and feeling and what Auggie is thinking and feeling.  For me this made for a book that was truly heart wrenching at times. There was more than one occasion where I wanted to hold Auggie in my arms and just love him.<br /><br />I thought the way the author told the story from multiple viewpoints was brilliant and makes for a great book for teachers.  The main theme of the power of kindness shines through bright and clear, and yet the author never says it directly, she just shows it beautifully through the words and actions of the characters. I've read a few criticisms that the ending is too idealistic and maybe it is to some degree, but then I think of actual news stories I've read about such things and then no, I don't think the ending is too idealistic. In fact, I love the ending. For me the really powerful part of the ending is not that Auggie's problems have all gone away, because they haven't and certainly unkindness can be found almost anywhere, but that Auggie has grown into a stronger person, as have those closest to him, and after all, isn't that what life is about? Being the best person we can be. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

0307279189|1.0|Don't know where to start. Very poor writing style, almost juvenile.<br /><br />Very egotistical in sense of portraying point of &#34;if you ain't Tarahumara, you ain't worth living - unless you are an ultra marathoner - and especially an ultra marathoner&#34;.<br /><br />Almost every &#34;fact&#34; discussed is either incorrect, exaggerated, twisted, or apparently fabricated! Read through it (if you can force yourself to) with a PC, iPhone, etc. to where you can google as you go along... And prepare to be shocked. No, ultra marathoners do not (routinely) outrun horses. In the several &#34;man vs. horse&#34; marathons / ultra marathons run regularly, the horses (with rider, saddle, etc. - and rules clearly set up in favor of humans) ROUTINELY (about 95+% or more) win those races. By the way, humans are NOT the only mammals that sweat... In fact the other one that swears extensively to cool off and even has - four - armpits are the horse genus (and mules bred for running and endurance have even MORE - much more - stamina and endurance than horses!!!).<br /><br />And it just keeps getting worse. Look up Phenols (supposedly the compound in plants - &#34;but especially high in corn&#34; - that protects the plant and is somehow good for humans). Is that something you'd want to ingest regularly? Well, no worries, what his &#34;expert&#34; should have been talking about was Phytates (look that up on Wiki also). And, phytates are NOT good for humans also! Nor are they &#34;5 times higher in corn than any other grain&#34; ( especially high in beans and very strong in soybeans).<br /><br />The whole vegan thing is blown out of proportion (weren't these &#34;running Indians&#34; running down antelopes, etc., to feed their families???). What about the running Africans? The Maasai, the Samburu, etc. back when they (the long distance running warriors) lived on a diet of milk, meat, and blood (yet were very tall, very lean, and low in cholesterol and had very good profiles). Or the fact that the life spans of Tarahumaras is 45? Yes, they have a moderately high infant mortality rate, but that is offset by a very high birth rate. The fact is that several will make it into their 50s, some into their 60s, and a very, very few to 70 - low 70s.... just like Micah True - who modeled his lifestyle and distance running like the Tumaharas - and who died this last April (2012) of a heart attack during a training run!<br /><br />http://reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8471HR20120508?irpc=932<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_True<br /><br />(Note that Micah True himself stated that the book &#34;contained inaccuracies and exaggerations&#34; ... Also read the findings of Dr. James O'Keefe after his analysis of the autopsy report and his belief that Micah True had a Phidippides Cardiomyopathy Condition caused by his extreme distance / extreme condition running - and that it is a cardiovascular condition suffered by many long-term endurance athletes (and kudos to the 1-star reviewer who accurately pointed out the real difference between the visual appearance of extreme distance athletes compared to that of anaerobic - with milder aerobic - athletes.... a group of top level sprinters to a group of marathoners for example).<br /><br />https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22222888?dopt=Abstract<br /><br />Just as scientific research / studies have shown. The author (who seems to no longer be running ultra marathons himself) takes data on how mild- to-moderate running levels as being more healthy than doing nothing (doh!) and arbitrarily extending that concept to ultra long distance running... which is simply not true...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Heck, I could go on and on and on. Like in the book when Micah True's boxing record &#34;got to 12 - 0&#34;... yet when I looked up boxing records, his Wiki bio and NY Times article on his death, his boxing record was 9-11!!!<br /><br />And it simply goes on and on!!!<br /><br />Like the author pointing out that the best runner of The Running Indians beat the world's best ultra marathoner in that particular Copper Canyon Race... but not that the tables were reversed the next year with the world's best ultra marathoner BEAT the best runner of The Running Indians (like insinuations that ultra marathoners routinely beat horses in man vs horse races).<br /><br />I'll leave the reader to read through the 3-star reviews and, especially, the 2-star and 1-star reviews to get the full picture on just how bad the writing style is (metaphors, hyperboles, etc., etc.,). I will close with pointing out how little one learns about the Tumaharmara and their day-to-day lives, their culture, their specific health profiles, dietary deficiencies, etc.<br /><br />Fortunately, National Geographic has done that for us. Check out their 2008 issue (around the time that the author was there and BEFORE book was published) and note the tremendous difference in the pictures painted... of course the National Geographic authors weren't out to make a killing with an egocentric book of mis-truths by selling a &#34;best seller&#34; book ( which proves that a sucker IS born every minute - fortunately I read a library copy!)...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Ignorance in this Age of Information is so offensive as to be an abomination!that the tables were reversed the next year with the world's best ultra marathoner BEAT the best runner of The Running Indians (like insinuations that ultra marathoners routinely beat horses in man vs horse races).

B0089LT8Y6|2.0|Like someone else said the album is solid enough, the vocals are in good shape and musicianship is good enough, a lot better when compared to their surviving contemporaries. I thought Cold Embrace was the best song here and Native Blood, Dark roots are the others. So I give it two starts for that.<br /><br />But about some of the lyrical themes:<br /><br />Chuck Billy being native has no problem talking about the injustice his people suffer at the hands of the 'white man's world'. I'm not white but I've always felt uncomfortable at how people complain about the 'white man' because it sounds like the same collective demonization the west directs at others. And I don't think it's right for anyone to be talking about how their \\"blood\\" will prevail. I don't like hearing even from oppressed people about the race pride factor. We're not different, atleast if you believe in co-existence.<br /><br />But the irony is in how Billy goes from this deep understanding of his people's suffering to dismissing as 'hate' the reaction he saw in a clip on the middle east, as he states in an interview. He was upset by the flag burning. In this case he switches to being a typical American like the 'white man' he talks about, and not interested at all in analyzing what he might be seeing. Gone is the near century history of US destabilization and continued invasions of the middle east, where you now have Obama sending in \\"rebels\\" gathered from half a dozen countries and shipped to Syria to fight that country. Most of America buys into the daily white house generated propaganda not knowing that government reports themselves report these elements as Al Qaeda. The same strategy employed in Libya and Iraq. These continued false flags and illegal wars, bombings of cities, killings of thousands (35,000 in Libya courtesy of US/Nato apparently) might possibly generate some US flag burning at the least. But according to the hypocritical lyrics it's just 'True American Hate'.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Having finished reading \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\", I have to say that the series ended quite nicely, as well as rather unexpectedly. However, I was quite satisfied with the closing developments in the relationship between now-married Christian and Ana. While the eroticism is creative, the final installment in the Shades of Grey Series is more relationship-centric than sexual escapades. And while the series is purely erotic fantasy, the concentration on the characters and the dynamic of their maturing relationship/marriage reflects that of actual \\"real\\" relationships, so it stands to reason that the author might concentrate on, and advance, these concepts.<br /><br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the series, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys other-than-vanilla-erotic fiction that delves into the sometimes-dark psyche of the characters as much as their BDSM-oriented sexual exploits. I, for one, wish there were more erotic series fiction in the same flavor and style. Well-done, Ms. James!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Listen to me when i tell you that this app is HORRIBLE...FOR BEING SO GREAT!!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|\\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" continues the romantic saga of Anastasia Steele and Cristian Grey as they discover more about each other and themselves, even while attempting to solidify a long-term relationship together. The storyline is excellent; certainly as enjoyable as the first installment (Fifty Shades of Grey), if not more in fact. The characters are rich and interesting, and the reader is thrust into a multi-layered satellite of subplots. Once again, the romance and eroticism is captivating and descriptive, while the depiction of the BDSM themes and situations continue to be compelling, realistic, and plausible; wholly satisfying, in fact. I wholly recommend this novel as a vital and enjoyable installment in the Shades of Grey series.

Sometimes in Rocky II you lose the french speaking for a written translation at the bottom of the screen.  After 10 or 15 seconds or so, it come back to normal(french speaking).<br /><br />If you're a fan of the Rocky movies, this is un must have.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|After watching the first season of HBO's take on this book, I sat down and read the entire series and loved it. Though the introduction of new characters later in the series forced me to stop to try to remember who these characters were, it added to the complexity of the story. I also love that the author is not afraid to kill off main characters - very realistic though sometimes regrettable. I also love that it is a long series - so much to enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very helpful.  I love this app because in just a glance I can find out if I need to take my charger with me for the day or not.  So glad that someone invented it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It has been a while since I finished this series, and granted there are already a plethora of reviews out there for it, but I wanted to add my two cents and say that it is a series worth reading. I felt that Katniss' reaction to having to pursue her \\"relationship\\" with Peeta in the midst of trying to survive in a kill-or-be-killed tournament realistic in a \\"I can't believe I have to pretend to be in love with this boy when my family and district are starving and I might have to kill him if I'm not killed first\\" kind of way. She simply has bigger issues to deal with but has to give the audience what it wants in order to survive. Not the typical \\"love at first sight\\" story, which I appreciate.  If you liked this series, I would highly recommend Veronica Roth's \\"Divergent\\" series (two books out with a third on the way) and Susan Ee's \\"Angelfall - Penryn and the End of Days\\" series (first book out with a tentative plan for four more - I can't say how much I am in love with this series!).
B0086700CM|3.0|I love playing this game om my iphone and was ecstatic when I would download it for my kindle.  However some of the controls are difficult and do not respond as fast as they need to, otherwise a fun game.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Easily fits in the change pocket of Carhartts, good build quality for the price and it works just as you'd expect it to. The only thing I felt could be different is to have a extra sharpening slot with extra fine ceramic to really bring a blade to a razors edge.
0439023521|2.0|I loved the story, but I sure didn't care much for the book(s).<br /><br />The \\"trilogy\\" was clearly a way to sell three books instead of one, and I found that a little irritating. Of course, I have no idea how it really went, but I would suspect that Ms. Collins submitted a single draft, was offered a three book deal, and then simply broke the single draft up into three books, because as the story starts out you know exactly how it's going to end, and the whole story could have easily been told in one book by using normal-sized print, rather than large font and double or triple spacing.<br /><br />Book one, The Hunger Games, is full of action, and is a good story as stories go. But a real trilogy functions as three connected, but independent books. The Hunger Games ends without a conclusion, and as such is not a standalone novel. Nor are either of the other two books. Sadly, when you finish The Hunger Games and are left hanging you know you've been had, and that this series has been marketed simply as a money-grab. The function of book two, Catching Fire, is simply to drag things out until book three. And book three, Mockingjay, is truly an ordeal to finish. Plot-wise, this one-story-in-three-payments reads out in the childish predictability of a romance novel.<br /><br />Even for a young adult fantasy/sci-fi, the number of pure conveniences used to make the story work is a little silly. Things appear in midair as a convenience so that other things can happen, quick sentences paraphrase events that we are told, but not shown. And by the time you get book three you realize there's no real satisfactory dénouement coming, and that's what happens. The entire story just ends with a little internal monologue describing what happened. For the author, it's simply the easy way out<br /><br />All that said and done, one has to accept that this is a story that should never have been published, but rather written right off the bat as a screenplay. It's the description of a cinematic display, where camera and costumes do the work. It is not literature, not a novel or real trilogy in a literary sense.  There is no real writing per se. There's fast action story, a description of events, and a predictable but nonetheless intriguing plot. What's missing are all the elements of good writing, good fiction, and a real good read, such as setting, character, significant detail and texture. You read this book, you don't feel it. You are told, not shown. You follow what's happening, you don't visualize it. And it leaves you hoping that the publishing industry hasn't decided that mainstream America is now more interested in sixth grade comic book heroes, rather than real life character driven stories, written by authors who know how to write.
1469984202|5.0|I'll keep this short. I'm not the greatest reviewer so I'll leave that to people better suited for it.<br /><br />I simply bought \\"Wool\\" because I saw how many people gave it 5 stars rating and because I needed a new science fiction book to read. I did not even look at ANY reviews. I did not read the description of what the book was about, and when i received the book I did not even read what was on the back of the book. Heck, even the title tells you nothing of what the book will be about. I came into this book completely clueless.<br /><br />All i have to say was this book was one of the more amazing books I've ever read! It's simply fantastic. Unlike some, I seem to have an easier time putting a book down, even if its getting good. For most of this book it is IMPOSSIBLE to put down. I lost so much sleep it was fantastic! Recommend with all my heart. I even just bought the authors. \\"First Shift\\" book just now! Bravo!

034580404X|1.0|I have no problem with practitioners of BDSM.  I have friends who have gone through with collaring ceremonies and it's as sacred a bond as marriage.  I don't object to their practices and would hope they don't object to my traditional marriage.  Which isn't exactly traditional but my relationship is not the focus here.  Christian \\"Fifty\\" Grey and Anastasia Steele's is, and their's is about as effed up as one can get, barring even the whole Master/Slave relationship.  Christian has mommy issues that cause him to lack any basic respect for women and cause him to, as he puts it, \\"beat the ass of little brunettes who look like the crack whore\\".  I'm probably paraphrasing.  Again, let me emphasize that I have no issue with any CONSENSUAL relationship.  Ana runs hot and cold from the moment Christian presents her with the Contract detailing what their relationship will entail.<br /><br />Shall I even mention her unbelievable ability to orgasm purely through breast play when the minority of women can orgasm via penetration?  Which, of course, she can.  During her first sexual experience.  Barring the unimaginable, mind-blowing sex, their relationship is pretty dysfunctional.  Most of her time is spent trying to fix him while he stalks her and tries to run every aspect of her life up to and including buying out the company she works for.  But of course if a woman truly loves a man, she can fix him, right?  And he's madly rich (but that doesn't matter to her at all).  Maybe I just don't understand the draw of a vulnerable, screwed up, rich, adolescent-minded, controlling, dominant stalker.  I mean, I want a man to be my partner and my lover, to support me when I need it and let me support him when he needs it.  I don't want him controlling me or being overwhelmingly jealous.  Bed play can be agreed upon by the lovers.<br /><br />The writing, oh the writing.  My daughter, who's six, has probably written better Disney princess fanfiction.  Seeing as this started as Twilight fanfiction, it can hardly be worse.  No, really.  The writing is simplistic.  I thought I'd give it a try because I have a number of friends who raved about it but... wow.  My brain just started rebelling.  Anastasia has absolutely no character development.  Christian actually had some potential but ends up as a misanthropic playboy with issues who never really deals with them because I guess he'd be less interesting without his sexual kinks.  He really doesn't change much from first book to the last.  I suppose I was meant to feel sorry for him because of his childhood but I ended up wanting to slap him most of the time for his overblown reactions.  There's a thin thread of plot here, but less than even most romance novels.  I'm still intrigued by the basic premise of the novels; i.e. a novel/set of novels exploring the prism of consensual BDSM relationships with well-written characters and an actual plot, so if I find one, I will happily read them.
B00723NWJE|5.0|CD arrived well ahead of time in Australia - service was great!  Extremely efficient and cost effective as usual.  Love the CD!
B004JC16LC|5.0|Because I just finished listening to the Beethoven piece (13 CDs), I could only provide partial comment.<br /><br />I am a fan of Furtwangler.  I understand his recordings are probably quite historical in terms of sound quality.  But I was surprised by the high quality of transfers in this release considering they were done in late 1940s and early 1950s.  Re-listening to the complete cycle of symphonies, I found that No.6 and No.9 were outstanding.  I did not feel \\"patching\\" in No.9 as some other buyers complained about with the EMI copy.  But I was slightly disappointed by No.5.  I lost the kind of \\"thrilling\\" feeling.  It could be due to the mono sound or undermined by another superb performance conducted by Carlos Kleiber in stereo.  I always tell people that a great recording is result of collaboration between the orchestra, the solo artist and the conductor. Piano concertos are no exception, in particular Edwin Fischer playing No.5.  This is a truly amazing collection of the works conducted by the legendary conductor.<br /><br />I will update my review while I am continuing listening to the box set.<br /><br />By the way, Germany's price cannot be beaten.
031620157X|4.0|Brought to you by OBS reviewer Karolina Avalon<br /><br />I'm going to start this review by saying one thing - I `m a huge Chris Colfer fan. I love almost everything the man does, and, along with thousands of others like me, I preordered this book at my earliest opportunity. However, once I received my copy, I was determined to read the book - and not let the name of the front of the book sway my impression of the story. I wanted to start with a relatively clean slate.<br /><br />And, let me tell you - the story is amazing. The premise is one that is known to fantasy fans. Kids fall into a world that they are unaware existed before, and need to find their way back home. What's great about this, is that Mr Colfer gives credit where credit is due, and gives nods to not only the obvious Hans Christian Anderson and the Brothers Grimm, but also C.S Lewis and even a small nod to Gregory Maguire. All of this is done really tastefully, and there is some wonderfully insightful meta about fairy tales made by Alex and Conner Bailey, and their teacher, Mrs Peters.<br /><br />Even with the nod to the classics, Mr Colfer manages to make the characters his own. The Evil Queen has some fantastic (and real) insight about people's perceptions of others actions - and is a great example of that. The Evil Queen also has a really amazing back story. Goldilocks has to deal with the ramifications of her altercation with the 3 bears, while Sleeping Beauty faces the trials and tribulations of  sleeping for 100 years. The Land of Stories world is a fantastic mix of Fantasy with Real Life problems.<br /><br />My absolutely favourite characters would have to be Goldilocks and The Evil Queen, who I've already mentioned, and Froggy (a frog man the twins meet on their journey and who tells them about the Wishing Spell that will get them home), the mermaids and Conner and Alex Bailey themselves. I could relate so much with Alex and Conner - remembered being both of them at one point in my life- and they are the smartest, sassiest and funniest protagonists I could wish for to take me through the Land of Stories. Honestly? The writing style facilitates this feeling too. As I was reading the book , it feels like Mr Colfer had grabbed my hand (as well as the twins' ) and said  \\" Here, let me show you my world.\\"<br /><br />There are some twists of the story that I could guess almost immediately (and moments where I felt that a point was being repeated needlessly) , and then there were others that I couldn't have picked in a million years. And, even with the twists that I had guessed - Mr Colfer managed to present it in a unique way that still had an element of surprise to it, and it was still a very enjoyable read. The illustrations by Brandon Doorman also is a wonderful facilitation into the journey of the Land of Stories (I was lucky enough to receive an American copy of The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell. Unfortunately, the map of the Land of Stories - which was created by Mr Colfer and drawn by Mr Doorman - is not in the Australian version of the book). This is a great kids' book, or a great book for the people who are still kids at heart, and always wondered what happened after the fairytale ended.<br /><br />Even if this book was not written by Chris Colfer, I would adore its' humour, its' sass, its' twists and turns and its' beauty. The fact that The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell does have Chris Colfer's name on the front of it makes it all the more special to me, knowing that this incredibly talented young man continues to show the world exactly what he is capable of. I am eagerly awaiting the second installment of  The Land of Stories!<br /><br />This review and more at openbooksociety dot comthey are the smartest, sassiest and funniest protagonists I could wish for to take me through the Land of Stories.

0345803485|5.0|I have read all three books.  Finished the first one at 9.30 at night and settled down for the night.  Woke at 2.00am, got the second book and started to read....wanted to see what happened next.  Mesmerized by the books, not so much for the sex, but for the story itself.  The controlling nature of Christian, and the wit of Anastasia.... some of her names for kinky things really made me laugh out loud.  It did take me a while to get into book one though, and once I hit abuot the first 100 pages I could see where I was going.  Certainly worth a read, and you must be broadminded!  I wonder what EL James will write next!
B008EL4YX6|2.0|this reminds me of an advanced version of pong if you liked pong then you will love this but its not for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how you don't get all the games at once the make you work for it. some of the games are silly but this is gaurenteed to have at least one game you'll like.
0143119680|5.0|I am reading this book and must say - I cannot put it down!!  For me, it's in the same categories as Harry Potter and the Twilight trilogy, in terms of intensity and story interest!  Excellent book.  The author clearly knows much about many subjects, which she expounds upon throughout the book.  It hooked me in the early pages, and I love the story of Diana and Matthew.  Thank you for writing such a tremendous book!  I'm ordered the 2nd part of the trilogy today!
B006XF5BTG|2.0|Half way through this book I was underwhelmed. After finishing its really nothing you can't find for free on bodybuilding.com (he even tells you to go there for workout routines.) The actual routines include very little information if any at all about why you should certain exercises, what muscles they are working and proper form for each. The end of the book is a link to a free report for his preferred supplements etc....enter email here to get your free report. I chose not to as I expect it will be full of affiliate links but this is only speculation on my part. At the end of the day this book is not worth the purchase. Much too opinionated to have the word science in it.
0756405890|5.0|Buy. This. Book. Right. Now.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. It is definitely a fantasy book that sets the standard for both great writing and great ideas.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app. it is great....there is so many games to play. it is very addictive. awsome awsome awsome
B0063IH60K|5.0|App runs great on kindle fire.  The rounds are consistent and challenging.  I had never played solitaire prior to this version.  I would recommend to anyone who likes games that challenge the player without making their eyes hurt from all the graphics in many of today's games.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have rarely seen such poor writing....how many times can the author use the words \\"murmur or mutter\\"? I would have put the book down instantly but it is curious to see what the world thinks is worthy reading material....wow.  Guess no one is having good sex!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|This game is very well designed. I've only been playing for about a day, so I can't say if there are any bugs. Something that caught my eye when I first started the game was the &quot;Create&quot; button on the title menu. Before I get into that though, I played the first 9-ish levels and they all look well designed and will get you thinking about every tap you make. Something else I like is the look, I love the doodley art style they went with. Now to the create feature. I think the Interface is very simple and easy to figure out, so you're not spending too much time wondering, &quot;What the heck does this mean?!&quot;. I do wish they would give you a bigger space to work with, but other than that I like it! I would definetly recommend this to a friend even for the $2.00 price.
084313352X|5.0|This story book is really cute. I read it and look forward to reading it to my grandchildren. It arrived promptly in the mail and is in excellent condition. Thank you.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Picked this up while searching for an online project management tool -downloaded it to my kindle and read it immediately (got so engrossed I forgot my sprinkler was on and flooded my garden!!) but it was worth it.  Loved the straight no pandering style and have taken so many of their suggestions on board and have paid it forward to my own clients.  A must read for entrepreneurs!!  Well done!
B0050PYNO4|1.0|The movie is funny.  I give 1 star because if you're watching the BD on an internet-enabled player, the software on the disk will download and show you ads while you are in the various menus.
0553582038|3.0|I just love Song of Ice and Fire, and book three was... awesome.  I couldn't wait to dive into the next book and find out what happened next.  But then, I read and read, and the more the book rolled on, the less happened.  It's still wonderful.  The characters are still compelling, and their world is rich and complex, but I feel the threads that held first books together starting to loosen.  Adding characters, forgetting about others for hundreds of pages.  Some characters that we all love so much, don't make an appearance in the entire book!  Say it ain't so, George.  Come back and make the second half of this series as superb as the first!
B008JH5CVS|4.0|It's a modern day re-make of Escape from NY/LA.  That said, it kept my attention for the entire time, and I enjoyed watching it.  No life affirming messages, or mind altering plots, just fun brainless action.  Good guys against bad guys, simple and straight forward with lots of punches, shooting and explosions.  Exactly as expected and wanted at the time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the ease of moving through the Bible and the translations to better understand God's Word.  This is the best free or paid Bible app I have.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I thought that \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" was everything a mainstream animated film ought to be: funny, beautifully wrought, moving - and this soundtrack complements the mission admirably. I thought so at the time I saw  the film, but forgot to pick up the soundtrack until today when my son was watching the sequence where Hiccup first rides Toothless. Like my favorite soundtracks (think ET), the music and visuals are complementary and each necessary for the other to succeed. As with any soundtrack, there are fundamental themes and lesser ambient pieces. The \\"big\\"  orchestral sets are marvelous in scope and dynamic range: \\"This is Berk\\" and \\"Test Drive\\" for instance. The instrumentation is fascinating and diverse, with thundering percussion and horns a'blaring. Some of it is so stirring and evocative that it could make a grown man weep (Romantic Flight\\"). If the music is inconsistent in its heritage, so be it - it is marvelous, joyous, occasionally bombastic, and stands on its own. But as a perfect compliment to a wonderful film, it is superlative. Should have won the Oscar in 2011 as should the movie in 2010.<br /><br />Update: I have listened to this album over and over. It has become a family favorite. My 8 year old son told me, \\"I don't know why I love it -it makes me happy and I can see the movie in my head.\\" What a complement to Mr. Powell.<br />Pieces that have grown on me particularly are \\"Coming Back Around,\\" which nicely pulls together many of the musical themes from the film in a presentation that is touching and rousing. \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" grows in intensity as the friendship it represents evolves. \\"See You Tomorrow\\" is a near miraculous dance piece that makes me smile each time.<br />I have reservations that they have green lit HTTYD 2 AND 3. Sometimes I wish they would leave well enough alone. I appreciate that this is a series of books, but as a collaboration of music and imagery, it is hard to top this work. We shall see.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is amazing. I love how I can build my own city and take charge of everything. I am so happy I downloaded. it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this free app tells exactly what your battery level is! also tells temperature of the device and how much power is used by certain apps! I would certainly recommend this app to anyone who is searching for a high quality device monitoring app!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have it on my cell as well as my Kindle Fire. Works great. It makes reading scripture so easy at night before I fall asleep. It also allows me to view more than one version of the Bible and to find specific scripture easily. Awesome.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Keeps me from having a dead battery because of it's verbal alerts. I wouldn't be without it. Plus free is a great  price!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Not much for righting reviews, but this game has me hooked. So I figured I would give it a good review
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|The science is there, but it is incomplete. That's why I give only 4 stars.<br /><br />Centered around carbohydrates, that advice alone is enough for the cost of the book. Still, you'll need a broader approach to really grasp and understand obesity and metabolic syndrome. The author doesn't take into account exercise and its relation with muscle's insulin sensitivity for example. Or its relation with muscle mass and metabolic rate. After reading the book you get the idea that you don't need to exercise and that is not a good advice. It's true that exercise alone is not enough to lose weight, but the metabolic benefits can't be ignored. Specially when we talk about weight loss mantainance.<br /><br />It doesn't give the proper importance to the toxic effects of fructose neither.<br /><br />If you follow the advices given in this book, you'll improve your health. You will improve your insulin sensitivity and you will lose some weight. But this is far from a panacea.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
B000024TT4|2.0|Was having a tough day when ordering this. Music from teenage years. These were songs I liked back in the day. However, compared to most of the other music I have or listen to, Oasis is a downer. If I can get past the depressing quality of the music, it's fine.<br /><br />Find different, less depressing music.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott's story telling is great.  He weaves his way through his path so far in life, in a way that makes you feel like you are with him.  It's like you know his friends and can actually feel the pain he felt and share the joys he had along the way.  It makes you reconsider your eating and gives you that extra push you might need during your runs.  Great book!!!
B000002BBY|2.0|Was having a tough day when ordering this. Music from teenage years. These were songs I liked back in the day.

0345803485|3.0|I was pretty excited to read this because everyone was raving about how awesome it was. I finally got a hold of a copy from the library, and was really dissapointed. ...<br /><br />1. It's very repetitive...very repetitive.<br /><br />2. Christian is every girls nightmare, so I'm not sure why ever girl (real world, not book world) is obsessed with getting their hand on Christian Grey. Sure, he's rich and really good looking, but that's about it. He's a complete train wreck and a control freak...like over the top, not healthy. I'm not really sure why everyone is so mad at Chris Brown when Christian Grey is probalby worse. I think I was more annoyed at the fact that she dealt with all his crap...sure she may have held her own for a second, but then she'd second guess herself, or she'd blame his childhood life and act like she was the problem, not him. Sure, it's nice to think that you can fix a damage guy and live happily ever after, but it hardly works out in the real world.<br /><br />3. I heard it was kind of like Twilight and it was! You have two people obsessed with each other, they break up (for a hot second) and it devestates them, he is over protected of her and watches her every move, she has mom and a new step father that lives in the South that she's close to but hardly sees, but she's really close to her ex-step dad Ray, and that's who she lived with before becoming an adult.<br /><br />4. The sex.... it's hot, and it shows a kind of fun way to spice up your own sex life by venturing out to the S&M world...but really, she drops an orgasim every time he touches her. Really?
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. Very easy to use for beginners!  Well worth installing and its free! Extremely happy with this product!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Fun game. I made it through all the levels in one day but user levels keep the game going. I got all A's except for lvl 59 which I can get in 16 moves.
B006OAB432|5.0|Thank you to FUN, the record company, producer, and/or anyone who was responsible for the decision to use a seperate full dynamic range master for the vinyl release!!  Sounds phenominal.<br /><br />Thanks!
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Mr. Follett, again, has written a book that you will read well into the night.  You want to cheer on the female characters and hope they accomplish their goals.  With a backdrop of World War II leading up to D-Day the reader will be swept into the story with feelings of hope, disappointment, fear and understanding.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|only thing I didn't like was that you have to be connected to the web for it to work. boo. I go camping a lot and expect it to work everywhere.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent and surprised me how captivating it was. Thoroughly enjoyed book & look forward to sequel.  I could totally see it as a movie or mini series.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|The most striking thing of the many striking things in Searching for Sugar Man is the personality of Rodriguez himself. Unspoiled, not bitter, undimmed perceptions, and the continued passion for his craft all make a huge imprint on the viewer. And of course, it is all the more impressive because he spent 30 years in demolition and cleanup instead of filling our minds and souls with his remarkable music. The story is too crazy to be made up; no one would see it if it were a piece of fiction, unless it was written by Kurt Vonnegut or Douglas Adams. But it is a true story, a gripping story, and a rewarding story. The story of a wonderful human being and a remarkable father. A feel good documentary which alone makes it a near impossibility. There is only one qualifier you will notice again and again in reference to Searching for Sugar Man: must see.
B004GYY714|5.0|absolutely love it one of the best apps out there. great app for all Bubba Army fans. a must download
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|Not much to add, just another good album by this group. The only other one I've bought is Hybrid Theory (which is better), but this one isn't too bad at all.
0545265355|1.0|Just noticed that the Kindle price of the books purchased separately is less than the cost of buying the trilogy.  You save $2.01 buying the three books individually.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|This movie was way beyond my expectations.  I went in thinking, \\"Okay, a low budget ultraviolence movie with good enough actors to keep me from walking out.\\" Then I watched it. OMG!!! This movie rocked.  Not only was the action absolutely fun to watch, but it kept you in the moment from begining to end. The acting was way better than I had even contemplated it ever being, I even shed a couple tears at the end of it. No spoiler alert from me... BUY IT!!!
B008EL4YX6|4.0|this is a very simple game that builds in complexity.played the game and got to the 11th or 12th level and lost interest. I liked the challenge, but it just didn't draw me in...
030758836X|1.0|I don't even know where to begin with this one. Do I start with the withering setup, or do I start with that \\"plot\\" twist, which we all saw coming a mile away, that opens the second part of the book? Lots of negative reviews have focused on the ending of the novel, which I never got through, so I can't comment on it, in all honesty. What I can comment on is my experience of reading half of this lame-brain book, which had such promise. See, there's something to liking at least one of the characters and there's also something to trusting that the narrative we're reading is honest and truthful. In The Church of Dead Girls, by Stephen Dobyns, the narrator, halfway through the book, confesses that he's...(I won't spoil it for you, because it's a totally great read). Here, because we actually \\"like\\" the narrator, we sympathize with him; we can feel his pain. This deepens our understanding of the other characters around him as well. It's a beautiful touch, a light touch, rather than what we get throughout Gone Girl, which is so heavy-handed and nonsensical that more than once I thought, Pulp it and use it as toilet paper. Because in so many ways that's what Flynn is doing to her readers--she's using us as her toilet. Look, reader, she seems to be saying, I can tell you whatever I want and deliver it to you however I want and you're going to buy it and I'm going to keep pooping it out and I'm going to use your sensibilities against you. What do I mean by sensibilities? I mean that if you give me a book that purports to be a mystery, then halfway through decide that it's actually not a mystery at all and something more akin to \\"The War of The Roses\\" (you remember that film, right?), then I'm going to call you out on it and I'm going to say that you've hijacked me and I'm going to say that you've cheated and I will cry foul. FOUL.<br /><br />This novel is nothing more than aggrieved screed against marriage, which is fine, but it's far from original and it's far from being a good read.
0345803507|1.0|I wish I could remember who suggested I buy these books, as rather than purchasing the first one and then getting the others as I normally do, I bought all three at once thinking it would be a good series.  These are truly the only books I have ever considered burning (wait--there were the Harlequin Romance novels), but the first book in this series makes even the Harlequins look good.  Why waste peoples' time with crap like this?  I felt dirty after reading it, but read it to the end to see if there might be some redeeming value and the woman might learn something.  I had a tough enough time with her being a virgin at 21 years old, but where she went from there is waaayyy beyond any plausibility.  Needless to say, I did not read the second or third book and rather than torture some poor soul at a yard sale, I threw them away. Okay, enough.... you have been warned.  As a general rule,  I love books, but this is just someone's sick aberration.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. I like how you get to customize your city. Don't listen to any bad reviews. Awesome game altogether.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't understand all the high reviews or the great love people have for this game. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the 99 cent version because I wouldn't buy it at 5 cents. It doesn't take any thought or skill and hasn't any entertainment value, neither is it even mildly amusing. The game is so incredibly easy on all levels that it is boring. You have to fling different size birds using a slingshot through the air to knock over pigs standing on/under different kinds of objects such as wood, glass etc. Once you get the \\"feel\\" of the slingshot (which takes all of about 30 seconds) you can breeze through the rest of the game. This to me is lame. I want a game that makes me think and/or problem solve...like \\"Where's my water\\" for instance or \\"100 floors\\"...or a card game where a little luck and skill are involved...or a word game like \\"Scrabble\\". I even like being amused with these games that have make believe animal you care for. (As long as I can play them without spending real cash-now that would be REALLY lame of me.) If I could give this game a -12 I would...Please don't write a review about me accusing YOU of being \\"lame\\" because you like this game or spend real money feeding make believe animals or buying swords to slay dragons or whatever-because that's NOT what I wrote. I said \\"For ME this game is lame and for ME it would be lame to spend my hard earned money on something that is just pixels on a screen. We all have the right to our own opinion...(it's still a free country right?...or did I miss the evening news?) And my opinion is...this game is lame.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very addicting and fun, JUST GET IT and plus its free and 126 minigames? awesome. get it. its fun.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Not a great book, but a great summer read with just enough thematic material in it to warrant the time spent with it.
0307454568|3.0|This installment links to the second novel in the trilogy almost as a paragraph break in separation from \\"..Fire\\". Unreformed by her contention with Swedish authorities, Lisbeth continues the struggle against Zala and Co. while recovering from the libelous defamation of character that has been projected upon her by the media. The protagonist acts as an illicit information specialist as well as providing surveillance for her allies in their exploration for expository justice. In fact, much what Lisbeth achieves surreptitiously, the entity known as 'The Section' preforms legally.<br /><br />As rogue intelligence expert, Salander is flanked by the staff of Millennium, SMP, S&auml;po, SIS, The Section and Svavelsj&ouml; MC. The story reveals, in detail, the process of investigation of a multi-faceted network of co-conspirators and players in a game of espionage and clandestine personal offenses. Their adversaries are advocates and enablers of the ignoble 'Zalachenko club' as well as quack doctors and legal guardians who wish to intern Lisbeth as a ward of the court.<br /><br />A reunion with Mikael Blomkvist complements the work of Salander in her efforts for anonymity in the midst of an expos&eacute; of her private life. The introduction of robust persona in the character descriptions of Figuerola and Linder fortify an authoritative presence in providing support for Blomkvist and the Millennium staff. In a single breath: \\"brevity would not have satisfied the completion of this saga.\\" Although the trial proceedings and bureaucratic investigative procedures do provide a retarded progress of the novel, \\"...Hornet's Nest\\" was worth reading for the same reasons that books 1&2 fill the series with exhilaration.
B0024CEY36|5.0|Although not one of his best books, such as the \\"PILLARS OF THE EARTH,\\" this book is fascinating in its complexity and surprising turnings and characterizations. It is a \\"page turner.\\"
0307594777|3.0|In three words: \\"intelligence meets counter-intelligence.\\" True to the spirit of a contemporary crime-fiction trilogy, The Millennium Series elaborates on technical theatrics from 'behind the scrim.' Journalist Mikael Blomkvist exudes exhausted perseverance in pursuit of moral assay. The pairing of Millennium and Milton Security provide a working forum in which investigations of inscrutable evils may be conducted at a level of arranged collaboration. The translation of these novels provide a charming cultural setting in which the stratum of justice bears the revulsion of the underground. Larsson paints the ethical contrasts of characters with regard to their feelings, opinions, preferences and obligations.<br /><br />At times coincidences can be questionably fortuitous for the players in these adventures, however \\"The Girl Who...\\" has no fear and is not without a myriad of dark conflicts and seemingly inescapable predicaments. Regarded as a modern-Masterpiece for its portrayal of electronic-eavesdropping, this narrative is worthy of three volumes in order to compound upon itself in installments.<br /><br />Unrelenting in its progress, the events of this saga move from mystery to scrutiny while maintaining the ethos and personality of the main characters, all of whom never seem to look back. A worthwhile read for fans of the genre and a new chapter in the fictional portrayal of cyber reconnaissance.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Oh dear! I so wanted to enjoy it after all the hype. Alas....<br />I had had an initiation into B and D/ S and M fiction previously, and yes this is a hybrid version of it... with a good dollop of traditional romance i.e. damaged (Rochester-type) hero saved by the love of a good woman.<br /><br />I may be the only person who found the sex scenes so persistent and repetitive I started flicking through the book trying to locate plot developments. It was the opposite of when I was a kid and skipped through the plot to find the sex scenes...<br /><br />Look I'm glad the author's made a lot of money. Good luck to her. I'm glad many readers have enjoyed it. Good luck to them. I'm a dissenting voice - I found it tedious. And good luck to me.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Honestly, I don't think this movie gets enough credit. The plot it amazing. The score is fantastic. The price was right. I'm sold! It arrived before the expected delivery date. Packaging was good. Condition was good.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|So far enjoying these books, with chapters from various characters' viewpoints. Tyrion is an especial favourite. The series reminds me of the Daughter of the Empire trilogy.

1594203334|5.0|Short and Sweet: My go-to parenting book! Without a doubt the most balanced and well-written book on the subject and one I'll be recommending to all parents, soon-to-be or currently.<br /><br />Full Review Originally Posted at my site There's A Book: Sitting quietly through a meal at a five star restaurant is seemingly an activity intended for the most well-mannered of adults, not children. For French families though this isn't only a regular occurrence, but something expected from birth. With conflicting ideas on every topic revolving around parenting in the country of her birth, the US, Pamela Druckerman goes searching for the explanation that rests behind the myths of French parenting. Their seeming ease with their children couldn't possibly be as simple as it looks or can it?<br /><br />Without any doubt in my mind Bringing Up B&eacute;b&eacute;: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting by Pamela Druckerman is the \\"holy grail\\" of parenting. Much like Druckerman mentions in her book, I'm the typical American parent. I've devoured every book I've been able to get my hands on, spent hours trying to determine what is the very \\"best\\" for my children at every stage and have also spent countless hours awake at night trying to attend to the needs of my children. Needs that I may have imposed on them because of my near constant worrying. Druckerman not only addresses sleep issues, but everything from snack time to playtime to eating out. Her writing is superb, balanced and completely engulfing. This is a parenting book I wish I had before my first son was born and will be handing out to all I know with children.<br /><br />Much like Druckerman herself, my first child was raised with my ever constant supervision and subsequent lack of sleep \\"schedule\\". He has thus been deemed the non-sleeper in the family and at almost five years old he still struggles to sleep through the night. My daughter on the other hand is the exact opposite. Having heard a bit of advice around the eighteen month mark of my son, I look back wishing I'd heard it sooner. Simply stated it was that you should treat your first child as though you already have a second child in the home. Very similar to the knowledge Druckerman garners in her early investigative efforts, by the time our second child arrived we had also unknowingly \\"learned\\" the technique she refers to as \\"The Pause\\". This technique isn't really a technique at all, more an ability to attune ourselves to the true needs of our children and not what we merely think they need. What I noticed from my first to my second child was that I relaxed a great deal and my attentive nature became more what it should have always been. Not that I wasn't paying attention to my son, but perhaps I was too attentive.<br /><br />What I appreciated the most about Druckerman's observations throughout the book was that she was not usually overly judgmental of a particular method of parenting, but that she presented all sides and expressed her interests in exploring more. On a whole the majority of the chapters were set up with an opening that involved either her own experiences or those of her friends, some French & some American, which was then followed by an explanation of how the French & American would typically handle the situation along with her research and closed with her thoughts. It was balanced, educational, most often involved some hilarious situation and always very well written. In most cases I found myself jotting down notes to discuss with my husband later and potentially attempt to incorporate into our own family.<br /><br />Bringing Up B&eacute;b&eacute;: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting by Pamela Druckerman is by far one of the most well written and informative parenting books out today. With a deluge of parenting how-to's from the internet to meeting groups to books and more it's hard to know when your head might stop spinning. It's nearly impossible for meto imagine a parenting book being a page turner, but this is certainly one I'd firmly announce as one. Druckerman's take on French versus American style parenting is dead on and not in a way that makes the reader feel like she's harboring a negativity she's yearning to get out. Bringing Up B&eacute;b&eacute; helps shed light on why exactly it is that the French seem to not only have the most well-behaved children, but also why their birth & mortality rates are some of the best in the world. Thankfully Pamela Druckerman took the time to look behind the mysterious walls of French homes to discover the structure and creativity that blossoms in these wonderful families and the children they love.ook being a page turner, but this is certainly one I'd firmly announce as one.

0763655465|5.0|Short and Sweet: A marvelous story about a very lovable dog trying to make the right choices. Perfect for teaching kiddos how to avoid temptation all while keeping them entertained with brilliant illustrations and a hilarious story.<br /><br />Full Review Originally Posted at my site There's A Book: When temptation strikes the unassuming yet lovable dog George what's he to do? With every intention of making the right choices and pleasing his very loving owner George still can't seem to help himself. Because who could truly ignore a delicious chocolate cake or a good romp in the flowers? Thankfully for George he's got Harry and Harry is the best owner a dog could ask for, making them a perfect pair.<br /><br />Oh No, George! was our first introduction to the creative world of Chris Haughton and it's been a wonderful beginning! Not only is Oh No, George! a book that children can relate to, but the colors and illustrations immediately grab readers. Having now read both Oh No, George! and Little Owl Lost I can honestly say that our family is hooked! His humor and style remind me quite a bit of Jon Klassen in his book I Want My Hat Back, though Haughton definitely has his own signature \\"look\\".<br /><br />In Oh No, George! you have what would seem to be a simple story about a dog who's been left home for the day while his owner is off at work or where ever he may be. Harry (the owner) asks George to be good and of course George is eager to comply with the request. Obviously it's not quite so simple. As a mom of two typical kiddos this was a story I was extremely happy to share! What child when told not to touch the cookies, the markers, the shiny expensive whatever isn't instantly drawn to that very thing? The will power required is next to impossible and quite honestly, humorous for the onlooker (of course unless they do actually break the shiny expensive whatever).<br /><br />Not only was Oh No, George! fun and entertaining to read with my kiddos, but perfect for sharing some important lessons in a way that they could absolutely understand. George at various points felt tempted, excited, mischievous, remorseful and at times completely distracted. There were lessons for everyone reading. Not only did the kiddos recognize the importance of listening and doing the things they are asked, but the ability there is to be forgiven when they do make mistakes (because it's bound to happen). Also, for both myself and the kiddos we were able to talk about ways to divert your attention away from the temptation by either me involving them in another activity (much like when Harry takes George for a walk outside) or by them choosing to play with something entirely different. All of this being said, as I mentioned, it's still fun, entertaining and filled with situations that had both Turkeybird and Littlebug rolling on the floor with laughter.<br /><br />Without any doubt in my mind Chris Haughton has another huge hit on his hands with Oh No, George!. This seemingly simple story is filled with lessons for children and adults alike, but is told in a way that all who read it will thoroughly enjoy their time with the book. Chris Haughton brings his characteristic quirky illustrations filled with vibrant colors to the pages within Oh No, George! and with them brings to life a very lovable dog who you can't help but fall head over heals for. Oh No, George! by Chris Haughton was an instant hit in our home and I'd highly encourage readers of the very best picture books to run out and read it immediately!g some important lessons in a way that they could absolutely understand.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Once I started reading 'Born to Run', I couldn't put it down. I am not very brave with reading non-fiction, but this one worked really well. After the captivating beginning, I got a little bored somewhere before halfway, thinking it got too American-flavoured for my European mindset, but as I read on, I thrully enjoyed the stories. Not sure if it will influence my running, but I got inspired!
B004X80QNG|1.0|I've been using PI for years (with my iPhone) and it's always been fabulous. I was a little disappointed when I got a Kindle Fire and found it isn't readily compatible - BUT I recently bought a year-long paid subscription to Toodledoo because it made for a great work-around and synced between iPhone and Fire perfectly. NOW, with this new update, you've made the sync settings inaccessible, telling me to make changes through Android calendar which Kindle DOES NOT HAVE. It was a giant pain in my ass to find a way to make this work so I could keep using PI, and you've effectively just removed it. Please fix this is you're about to lose a loyal customer.

0872860175|5.0|Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Howl\\" was probably the dividing line between two Americas, two generations, two sexualities, two cultures. He was of course indicted and arrested and this poem barred from publication - of course again making it sell a lot more copies eventually - but in a way he was America's first great modern poet. The first line became a sort of countercultural national mantra:<br /><br />\\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked\\"<br /><br />\\"Howl\\" presents a view of contemporary society, placing a source of human woe within human consciousness and perception. In his poem, Ginsberg uses the word \\"Moloch,\\" for the condition of the mind. The narrator declares\\" Mental Moloch!\\"... Moloch who name is the Mind!\\" According to Ginsberg, we are born in a state of \\"natural ecstasy\\" but Moloch \\"enter's the soul early\\". He pushes for an emergence from the belly of \\"Moloch,\\" or the monster of corrupt institutions that devours us, \\"bashe[s]\\" and eats \\"up our brains and imaginations.\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite poems of all time and an absolute must read.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I loved this movie! It was absolutely hilarious and such a good laugh. Language could have been toned down a bit, but other than that I have no complaints. Can't wait for the sequel!
030758836X|4.0|If yout haven't read this book, I recommend you not read this review or any others, actually. Part of the fun is not having any idea what's going to happen. You will be [[SPOILED]] if you keep reading.<br /><br />I loved Gillian Flynn's writing. I haven't read a book written with really high-quality writing in a while, and this book was delicious just for its use of language alone. I also thought she mastered the unreliable narrator device in Part 1. I didn't feel like it was contrived, and I felt like with mere clauses, Ms. Flynn cast doubt on Nick's motives and with each revelation, I felt a \\"wow\\" moment.<br /><br />The character of Amy Elliott Dunne is one of the creepiest villains in modern literature. She is a real psychopath. It was amazing how I did a complete 360 within pages of starting Part 2. The depth of her psychosis is terrifying.<br /><br />For the quality of writing and the plot, which kept me turning pages right to the end, I give this book 4.5 stars. For the story itself, closer to 4 stars, and the ending, as far as my sense of personal satisfaction, about 2.5 stars.<br /><br />The problem with making Nick seem so suspicious in Part 1: We never get to understand WHY he was acting cold and distant, not worried, and in fact why he kept saying \\"This is how the worried husband is supposed to act now.\\" I believe it is because Nick was so consumed with making people like him, with acting \\"right,\\" that he was unable to act genuinely at all. I feel sorry for him, especially by the end, because I think he really has no identity. He is who Amy makes him/wants him to be.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed in the ending. I wanted Amy to \\"get hers\\" so badly. I wanted to see her taken down as meticulously as she took down those she felt wronged her. I wish Flynn could have orchestrated Amy's take-down as masterfully as she created such a demented character. I believe this likely was the ending Flynn wanted, though. The villain wins. NIck lives in terror and fear. And God help the child!<br /><br />Part of me wonders if we'll see Nick and Amy again. I feel like this ending lends itself perfectly to a sequel!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I enjoyed the mystery surrounding the disappearance as well as the back and forth chapters from the point of view of the husband and then the wife. If you are married you can definitely relate to some of the things the characters talk about. Yes, as others have said, the ending is a little unsatifiying but it seemed somehow appropriate. Don't let this stop you from reading it. It is a thrill ride!

B006LSZECO|5.0|It's hard to describe this book without giving anything away, and it doesn't sit nicely in any one genre. It's sort of a who-dunnit, but not really, and it's sort of a thriller, but it's one of the funniest thrillers I've ever read. Nick Dunne is a laid-off writer who moved back to Carthage, Missouri to take care of his ailing mother. His wife is also a laid-off writer, the inspiration for her parents' Amazing Amy series of children's books. On the morning of their fifth anniversary, Amy goes missing. The living room shows signs of a struggle. The door was left standing open. And the police are very interested in Nick's whereabouts...<br /><br />And we'll leave it at that. This is the new \\"it\\" book for the summer, so when you're finished with the Fifty Shades trilogy, this is what you should be moving on to. And unlike Fifty Shades, Gone Girl is extremely well-written and full of quotable lines. Here are a few favorites:<br /><br />\\"Trying to make myself remember the suffering in Darfur. To put things into perspective. Which, I guess, is just further exploiting the people of Darfur.\\"<br /><br />\\"Does anyone to anything profusely except apologize? Sweat, I guess.\\"<br /><br />Flynn captures the culture of Missouri flawlessly (after Winter's Bone, this is the second thriller I've read that was set in Missouri, so is that a thing now?) and very believably articulates the relationships between the characters. Amy and Nick repeat each others jokes and both misuse the word \\"literally\\". Amy and his twin sister margo finish each other's sentences, etc, etc. And if the prose doesn't suck you in, the plot twists will.<br /><br />I did have a couple of problems with this book. The ending deflated a bit, not that it was an unsatisfying ending, but it felt like a coda on top of a coda on top of a coda. And then there's the fact that the two principle characters are writers. Aren't all the lead characters in popular literary fiction either writers or academics? Neither of these ruined the book for me.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and add this one to your summer reading list. It's remarkably well-executed fun and it's the book everyone will be talking about in a month.

B008BM9L72|4.0|Well, I decided I needed to read these, due to the fact that so many women I know were reading it and giving each other knowing looks?!?!  and I wanted to know what the huge amount of publicity was about.<br /><br />I found that the first book was very poorly written.  The english used was immature and repetitive.  But once you got past that, it was very interesting reading!  Unfortunately, the book ended way too soon, so I was straight onto no 2 (Darker!).<br />This was a much better written book, with less repetition and a bit more of a story to it!  Again, it ended too soon, so straight on to no 3.<br />The third book (Freed) was better again, with less emphasis on the actual sex and a story which was pacey and gripping.<br />On the whole, I found it hard to put the book/kindle down some nights, reading up til around 2am sometimes.<br />Thoroughly recommend reading it.

0307719219|4.0|If you are already familiar with A&R's work, you won't find any new theory in here, but the book is filled with historical anecdotes and examples that are entertaining in their own right. In many ways reads like a \\"Greatest Hits\\" issue of The Economist newspaper, if The Economist had been published for the last 1000 years. The book is written in a politically neutral way, but its conclusions are exemplary of neoliberalism.<br /><br />Organizationally, the book is a bit all over the place. The chapters almost seem to be written piecemeal, and while they all meander back to the thesis eventually, I think it would have been better to organize the book conceptually rather than more-or-less chronologically.<br /><br />All in all though this is an excellent book and worth the time it takes to read it.

0743270754|5.0|I knew relatively little about Lincoln, and nothing about his fellow republican running-mates before this book. Team of Rivals makes you feel as if you are right there among them as Lincoln is making decisions. The book is very thorough, reads like the great story it is, and is inspiring. Lincoln brought out the best in his cabinet, his soldiers, and anyone else he came into contact with (in their own unique way). He was a master politician, speaker, and philosopher, and just enough of all three to make epic decisions that united the States and shaped the country's future. This book does a great job detailing their efforts.<br /><br />The friendships described are passionate and add personality to the book and the characters. I had a to put on a brave face to read the last few pages.<br /><br />Recommend the book to history buffs (lots of Civil War detail), people who will give a speech at some point (he was among the best ever), philosophy buffs, political buffs and individuals looking for a story of friendship (not cheesy in the slightest) or overcoming tremendous obstacles. 5 stars, easy.

The concepts of good and evil and the very meaning of life itself are examined in exquisite detail, while our favorite anti-hero, Lestat de Lioncourt, is caught in a web of intrigue that makes the reader actually feel pity for him. This is not a breezy, mid-afternoon read. Do not expect to come out the other side with your preconceptions intact. \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" is compelling and thought-provoking and spellbinding. You will never forget it.
B0018O761I|4.0|I should start off by saying that perhaps my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt since it's colored by personal bias resulting from nostalgia -- these specific performances by the Munich Bach Orchestra were my very first introduction to the Brandenburg Concertos and were what made me fall in love with them.  Other reviewers have commented that these recordings are dated and less than authentic, and this may very well be so -- but personally, I don't think this should necessarily outweigh or even detract from the spectacular energy and brilliance of these performances (particularly Concerto No. 3).<br /><br />I've listened to other recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos, but they quite honestly leave me cold because they often come across to me as too solemn and staid -- even though I realize this may be the effect of the Munich Bach Orchestra recordings being my first exposure to these works.  (Had it not been so, it's possible that I would perceive these recordings as rushed.)  I sometimes think that when people picture Bach, what leaps to mind are the portraits in which he's depicted with a rather severe expression on his face -- and perhaps this is why Bach usually tends to be performed with a sense of restraint.  By contrast, I experience the Munich Bach Orchestra performances as refreshingly joyous and passionate and while I may be wrong, I prefer to think that this was how Bach originally intended them to be performed.  After all, let's face it...a man who fathered twenty children in all (even though half did not survive to adulthood) was probably not lacking in passion!

1468161660|2.0|This book came up as a suggested read when i purchased another book. I saw the 5 star ratings so bought it. I wish I hadn't. I'm in my 30s though so maybe for a teenager this book would be ideal, just not for me (though I enjoyed twilight series). I thought the main character, Lake, was a bit of a brat really. There were some ok parts to the book, but just don't buy this book thinking its 5 star, because it isn't.
030758836X|1.0|1. Started well.<br />2. Got worse<br />3. Unlikable characters<br />4. Mystery readers like to have all information and try to figure out the plot.  Did not happen in this book.<br />5, Ends poorly.<br />6. Unsatisfying
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a very good updated version of this game. lots to do to keep yourself busy and you can get as creative as you can be
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it awesome for kids my lil bro loves this game. he plays it every day he is glued to it
1468161660|5.0|OMG...absolutely one of the best books EVER!!!  It was fresh, different and delightfully entertaining.  There was a constant stream that ran through this book like a quiet creek on a hot summer day.  It's not loud and overpowering, but you know it's there none-the-less.  I cannot and will not compare this to any book I've read in the past...it's that unique. I also will not talk about the actual content of the book. I want all readers to be as pleasantly surprised as I was upon reading it....which you will do in one or two days! Great beach read, by the time the sunsets you'll be finished (albeit a little sunburned!) Read it...that's all I'll say!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a cool game it help me have fun because it ts the same game as my friends fun!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1401940676|4.0|I enjoyed Anita's story. It helped me sort out some questions I have about my spirit and its potential. My wife of 42 years just past and Anita's book gave me some closure.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game reminds me of a cross between Minesweeper and Soduku, with the added twist that each puzzle, when solved, makes a picture.  The tutorial does a good job of introducing the basic mechanics of the game.  The levels gradually increase in difficulty, but the more you play, the more strategies you'll discover for solving them.  The visuals are functional, with a simplistic beauty.  The publisher has done a great job of releasing updates with additional puzzles.<br /><br />I got this as a Free App of the Day, but I'd say it's well worth the regular price.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I started off thinking this book was very similar character wise to a particular tv show that has been on the air for the past few years, but soon changed my mind. The circumstances that happened to both Lake and Will are extremely sad, but it reminds us that not everyday is guarantee. This book definately took me by surprise with how everything played out and I would definately recommend it as a great read.
030758836X|2.0|How can so many people be so wrong?  I bought this because I thought it would be an intelligent book as well as a a great story.  This is exceedingly rare in this genre.  I<br /><br />It is intelligently written in some ways.  But it is also a bore.  The who-done it part is pretty easy to figure out.  The story moves very slowly as we hear tremendous amounts of observations about the characters recent or past lives that don't contribute to a plot or story-line.  The last 1/3 does have great moments, but they are few and far between.  The picture of the main characters is hammered home ad nausea and I was tired of hearing more of the same.  Some of the secondary characters are silly cliches, and overwrought.<br /><br />How can a book hit you over the head 100 times, lack subtly, and be boring for most of the read?
055357342X|1.0|This write is so sick of mind that i think its a crime to let him live free, he should be in one of the mental asylum.<br /><br />DONT READ THIS BOOK.
B0030MKGKY|5.0|Jeremy Renner is outstanding. This film makes you feel as if you're in Iraq. Thrilling, compelling, heart-rending, gritty, savage, touching.
B004I744AS|5.0|can't believe this was free. fun home page and many useful options. I use it all the time. definitely the best dictionary out thee.
0230709532|5.0|This is such a great little lift-the-flap book! The words are simple and catchy, and the story is funny. Even I like the story, so it makes it more fun for me to read it over and over again. My baby loves to lift the flaps and look inside. The flaps do stick a bit (as all lift-the-flap books do), but I find the material this book is made of to be quite durable. None of the flaps have ripped off yet and we read it almost every night at bedtime. This is the type of book that pleases both baby and parent.
B003VANOFY|1.0|First, I'll say these are super comfortable even with glasses and 3D glasses.  I can wear there for HOURS (3+) at a time and not even feel them.  Also positive is the range.  I could wear these all over the house and not worry about it.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY:<br />1. The sound quality is poor, at best.  I think those who have said that the sound quality is good should really try a higher end set of headphones - and I'm not talking crazy $300+ pairs, either - $100 will buy a really decent set of headphones that sound miles better than this.  Or even a decent set of surround speakers.  My $300 HT computer speakers sound 10x better than these, but, of course, you use headphones so that the wife and kids don't get bothered by your gaming.<br />2.  There is no bass; and, worse, the bass gets distorted and then bottoms out.  It's really distracting and takes away any immersion from playing.  You will use the EQ to remove the bass from your sound.<br />3.  The \\"surround sound\\" is mediocre.  It's definitely not a huge sound stage nor is it amazingly directional.  It's there, for sure, and when it works and quiet enjoyable.  But it's nowhere near as immersive as one would like.<br />4.  After just a couple of months, my headphones aren't taking a charge.  Google this product, and you'll see tons of people complaining about various problems with these headsets.  I don't abuse my stuff, and was fairly gentle with these when taking them off, laying them down, charging, etc.  I'll call Logitech on Monday about a replacement set, but it's just a big hassle.<br /><br />I got these because they were the \\"cheapest\\" wireless solution that I thought would be acceptable.  I've now ordered a Mixamp Pro (which, unfortunately, is wired) and will try that setup with a decent set of headphones that I have (and paid $120 for over 15 years ago and are still rocking the house) and a cheapo clip-on mic.  Once that comes in, hopefully I'll update this review with a comparison.<br /><br />But,yeah, VERY disappointed in this product and feel like I wasted my money on these.
0689835604|5.0|A great little lift-the-flap book. The words are so simple, perfect for babies. My baby started lifting flaps around 11 months and this book was right up his alley. He read it every night. He loved to flip all the flaps and then touch the face of the baby hiding behind the flap, and when he got to the last page, he would always smile when he found the hiding baby. The only trouble with this book is that the flaps tear off easily. We've had to glue some flaps back already.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|First... couldn't put it down... This story was so smooth and well written that I was immersed into the story immediately. The descriptions were flawless and didn't feel too overly abundant, while the action scenes were perfectly orchestrated and deliciously hack n' slash.  By far the best digital book written by an independent author that I've ever read.  I can't wait for Book Two!<br /><br />As far as typos.. seriously? there were like... 4... not even work mentioning it as a negative.. :/
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is a really good puzzle app a little slow but still pretty good. eventhough the puzzles are limited pretty good
B004I1WIWU|5.0|This girl has a very distinctive and beautiful voice and a unique style. I decided to get the vinyl and when I opened it I was surprised to find the code to download the mp3 version from the Adele.tv site, inside the package, so now I can hear the LP in my turntable at home and take the whole album with me anywhere else. Very pleased.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app! You don't need facebook or an email account to log in. It's just the radio. You can also preset some radio stations and that really comes in handy! Best radio app ever!!
0345803485|4.0|The writer is horrible with descriptions of people, places, etc. But she is wonderful at describing emotions & peaking curiosity.  It was enough to keep me reading & i'm buying book 2&3!
0736063684|5.0|Any strength training exercise you can think of is described, with an encyclopedia of detailed drawings to demonstrate each movement, plus sections on proper exercise form and injury prevention. Written for a man's body, but a female version, WOMEN'S STRENGTH TRAINING ANATOMY, is also available by the same author.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and best of all it does everything it promises *happy dance* and you can even be friends with an Ipad owner yay!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was aghast that Katniss married Peeta!  She was so much better suited to Gale and she had a much better history with him.  It rather ruined the entire story.  And Katniss with children?  She couldn't have been much of a mother as she said she didn't want children, she just had them because Peeta wanted them!  Not a good reason!
B007SSEBCU|3.0|A good film, but nothing special. Many of the critical issues she dealt with are not fully explored, thereby missing the importance of them.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I loved this movie. It was a real eye opener, and should have had a theatrical release! With all the crap that gets put into theaters, it's gems like this that outshine them all. Battleship?? (haha, yeah, computer effects, computer effects *yawn*). The Devil Inside? (please!). Goes to show you that hollywood doesn't know treasure from trash. I highly highly recommend Machine Gun Preacher. It will leave you walking away, knowing there are good people in the world and that there still is some hope.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|Keane is not for everyone. That should be made clear. It is not the kind of music you would jam in your car to look cool or necessarily listen to in front of your friends. But if you like slightly retro, melodic, piano and synth music with a bit of emotional drama that does not sound like anybody else, then read on.<br /><br />If you know the song \\"Somewhere only we know\\" then you know the excellent song craft can Keane exhibit. The melodies and words work their way into your mind and later you may find yourself humming the tune when nobody is listening. This band is not afraid to try new sounds or switch up the style, but 3 things remain in just about every Keane song... excellent expressive singing, piano, and thought provoking lyrics that paint a story in my head when I listen.<br /><br />This latest album is often compared to their past works or even a particular song, but bands cannot remain in one place... or they become period bands that only play their greatest hits. I think this album rates as high as anything they have done in the past and in some cases, I find myself hitting the repeat button to hear every nuance of a favorite song.<br /><br />Highlights are:<br /><br />Neon River - A lover moves on... one is left behind...<br />Sea Fog - This melancholy song is like a sad memory of a close friend's death<br />Sovereign Light Cafe - this reminds me that you cannot always return home once you leave it...<br />The Starting Line - An inspirational song of pushing on despite setbacks<br /><br />Enjoy...
0741470314|5.0|it's this book is amazing,it's tells more about the king of pop of his final days, and final years too,and dr. karen did a super job.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent story, well written, with a good plot and well-developed characters. I would recommend for anyone, from teenagers up. Better than the movie, although I also enjoyed the movie.
0345803485|1.0|Worst book I ever read!!! I am still trying to figure out why most people who have read it, enjoy it so much. Experience with Amazon is awesome though!
B0077SGMXM|3.0|great game, just wish it was updated to include the features that the IOS app has like head to head play. 5 stars if had that
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really love this ap! Couldn't wait for it to be free (like how I got Where's My Water). Can't wait to get further!!!
B000QI2ZWW|2.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this movie.  However, it was incredibly dissapointing.  I don't understand the awards for animation.  With the exception of the animated humans, it was remarkably un-remarkable to watch.  The monotony of the black and white with the weird sexual shapes, sounds and overtones was rather disgusting in a childrens animated movie.<br /><br />I'm no prude I assure you, but I don't appreciate watching a \\"family movie\\" with the rather startling moans and groans that these penguins \\"sing.\\"  Gross.<br /><br />Too Bad.  I wanted to like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|enjoied book #2  it was good and fast reading now look forward to #3  was expecting it to be different
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It has okay games, some of them are a little tricky to complete.  the controls are sketchy on some of the games and instructions don't always make sense.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|if you are board and have nothing to do you can play this fun and challanging game I have played lots of glue games but this one is my favorite
B0063GORYU|4.0|The only drawback is that you have to have Internet connection to play this free version because of the advertising.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This review isn't a slam against the author. I appreciate the time and effort required to write one book, much less three. I read Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker. I won't be reading the third and last in the trilogy. The first was purchased to see what all the fuss was about, the second purchased in the hope that having written the first, the writer's technique would have improved. Sadly, it wasn't so. As far as my take on the story itself. I could not connect with the characters. Any of them. I could not feel any love between Christian and Anastasia.  The plot, if you could call it that, was merely a vehicle to move the characters from one location to the next in order to have sex - not make love - sex. I understand that a movie is being made from these books. I do not for one minute envy the screenwriter that undertakes the task to move this story to screen.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this is a very fun and challenging game. I would tell people that its s great buy and a great game.
1442419814|5.0|(refers to the 2005 edition)<br /><br />In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.<br /><br />Please do not be fooled by the title of this book.  It is FILLED with adventure, friendship, betrayal, sacrifice, danger, faith, history, humanity, and a procedure that provides equality yet also harms each individual.  The truth in this book is powerful enough to change the way you think.  The truth in this book is powerful enough to destroy lives.  In a government controlled society where everyone thinks the same way, the truth will only cause problems and division.  I mentioned faith to describe one of the elements in this story, but it is not a Godly faith.  However, it takes faith to bring justice and restoration in a world that is hurting.<br /><br />Tally lives in a world where rooms talk; brushing teeth comes in a pill; communication takes place through pings; one can get in trouble for forgetting the government issued ring, skipping classes, or tricking the house into playing one's music louder than usual.  When you turn 16, you get a procedure classified as becoming Pretty.  Tally CAN'T WAIT to turn 16.  Being pretty means freedom, being pretty means no curfew, being pretty means having fun all the time, being pretty means a new acceptance into society.  Being pretty means having an extreme makeover that not only affects your looks, but it also cures bad habits like chewing your nails and repairs any scars you have.  And if your friends turn 16 before you do, then you can no longer be around that friend until you also turn 16.  Everyone's identity rests in being pretty and life is better for those who get the procedure.<br /><br />Peris is Tally's best friend, but he turns pretty a few months before Tally does and their friendship is put on hold with the expectation that she will soon follow and life will be better for both of them.  But then Tally meets Shay one night and their friendship brings changes Tally wasn't expecting.  Shay introduces Tally to The Ruins and what entails both terrifies and obligates Tally to change her original plans.  The reader will also meet Dr. Cable who is an important character in this story.  This book will teach you the difference between Uglies, Pretties, and Specials who work for Special Circumstances.<br /><br />It's all from Tally's perspective and I'm amazed by the perspective she has throughout the story.  Her loyalty is unmatched and I believe that Peris doesn't deserve her friendship once he turns Pretty.  She's a quick learner and she considers carefully every decision before making a move.  Even though sometimes her actions seem reckless and she is constantly taking risks, there is purpose to everything she does.  There is violence in the story, but it makes for a page turner.  Only one use of the word hell was the only profanity I found.  Tally kisses one boy in the story, but it's nothing sexual.  The book is divided into 3 parts.  I also want to point out that this is the second time I've read this story and I enjoyed just as much as the first time.  I loved Tally's heart in this story and how her story gets more and more involved.  This is the 2005 version of the book with the original cover art, for ages 12 and up, I got it from the library.  Honestly, I DO NOT like the new covers for this book.  I believe the original covers captured the story well enough, but I guess someone felt the need to update them.<br /><br />I highly recommend Uglies as a clean YA adventure for teens.  It's not only entertaining, but also gives valuable lessons about one's identity, issues such as anorexia and bulimia, celebrities, acceptance and loyalty.  Being loyal will cost you everything so be ready to do what's right even if you stand alone while doing it.<br /><br />The last line of this book has the reader intrigued to read the sequel immediately, but this story does well as a stand alone.  Some of the questions I have for the next book are:<br />When Tally becomes Pretty, will she be alone?<br />How will she change mentally?<br />Will she remember anything from before?<br />Will she remember her friends?<br />What will happen between her and Shay?re? Will she remember her friends? What will happen between her and Shay?
B00006AW63|3.0|THIS DVD WAS NOT FORMATTED FOR THIS REGION-SO IT WOULDN'T PLAY ON MY PLAYER- HAD TO SEND IT BACK. SO BEWARE WHEN YOU ORDER A DVD THAT IT WILL WORK IN YOUR REGION. I KNEW AND STILL ENDED UP WITH WRONG ITEM.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Early Rush fans will eat this up.  These guys, as this performance shows, were a force to reckon with in their early days and long before they'd received any kind of national, let alone international recognition.  This CD has them TEARING IT UP in a vintage year, 1974.  Their powers are strong.  I love everything 70s Rush and have always had an affinity for the first 3 albums - \\"Rush Archives\\" (the first 3 albums in a set) was my second Rush purchase way back when, so knowing this stuff inside and out already, it is a real treat to hear these live renditions from the first and a bit of the second album, not to mention a few of the never recorded tracks thrown in for good measure.  Alex Page is frickin on fire. Geddy's at his punkish screaming best. Neil is Neil - what an opportunity for \\"Rush historians\\" - here's Neil basically just coming into the band. Early Rush fans and any other Rush fan that wants to see the prowess of the band a meager 5 years into their career and the boiling cauldron they were born of are not going to have to think very hard about getting this CD.
B008MEM24S|1.0|ok this is a horrible game. this always is freezing. do not download this game. iti s not worth the money

B001L5U15M|1.0|I drove over 100 miles to get to a professional photographic store in Dallas looking for a bag to carry a D800, D700 and +/- 5 lenses of varying sizes, as well as memory cards & other odds and ends. The person who assisted me raved about this bag and highly recommended it - so I bought it. I did not realize it then but now, as I'm packing it for the first time, discovered that the contents are ONLY accessible from a small top cover and it does NOT open like a Lowepro Slingshot. This means that any lenses you pack in the lower region of the case are completely inaccessible unless you unpack everything above them first. This is about the dumbest, most idiotically designed camera bag I have ever owned in 35 years of buying such items. If I were not so far from Dallas I would take it back tomorrow, get my money back and probably go for the Slingshot. If you only have two bodies and two lenses that you leave attached to your bodies, this may work for you. If however you have two bodies and a number of lenses you intend carrying and interchanging whilst out shooting like I do, don't waste your money on this poorly-conceived piece of junk. I have a Lowepro Pro Runner 200AW which is a vastly superior bag but just not big enough to carry what I need on my current trip. I am very disappointed in this bag especially since it is so expensive. I'll never buy another one of these.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|First book kept my interest but it seems like the writer ran out of ideas and started just making up totally new (and STUPID) storylines right at the end of Book Two, hoping people would buy the next book.  I won't be one of them.......... I was TOTALLY BORED with the new story line at the end of this book!  On to something more interesting to read............
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love all of the books.  I never thought I would ever read them but I am so glad that I did!!  When you get past the very descriptive parts of the books that are about sex it is actually a story of love!!  There is so much more to it than just sex and as the books go on the description of the sex gets a little less but the real story of love and the trial and tribulations of their love is always there strong and steady throughout the book!!
B004J4WKTW|1.0|It was a long drawn out book that seemed to last forever with no real point! I had to make myself finish it just to see if it ever got better..........it did not!
B006JD48NM|5.0|Great collections of the life of Senna. A must have for a Senna fan! Don't miss your chance to purchase a copy.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I bought this game thinking  about how much I LOVE the game uno, But you pretty much  play the computer which always wins. Know fun twist to the game,  Nothing to win or no fun little prizes you could win! I am not a big fan
B008IJTFYW|5.0|works better with big comfy headphones.  like beats by Dre.  had it during a road trip while people were listening to radio I was asleep.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I was a little hesitate to buy this movie. I had read some negative reviews and I was concerned it wouldn't do Dr. Seuss justice. Well I was wrong. I was amazed that the movie was able to break down real problems and the bureaucracy that goes along with it into a digestible form that could really speak to kids. It has a sense of balance that is created through humor, so it's not all doom and gloom. Let face it though, digging our heads in the sand and pretending that we aren't up against some real problems in our world and society is an injustice to ourselves and our kids. \\"Oh that's hippie talk.\\" Man, how many times have I heard that ignorant phrase. Well I don't know about you, but I don't want to die off slowly from cancer because we neglect our responsibility to our community and world for the sake of corporate profits. I love how it exposes the psychology of commercials and gimmicks. If you want to plant a seed in your children's hearts and minds that we have a sense of responsibility to ourselves and the creatures we share it with to understand the simple phase, \\"You reap, what you sow.\\" this movie you just might enjoy. If not, don't watch this movie or buy it. All 3 of my kids loved the movie.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Written by a Summa Cum Laude constituent with a Business Degree who believes in the creation of jobs and generating an economy that contributes to well being of society as a whole.<br /><br />The Lorax has been seen on Mazda commercials and hacking i Hop pancakes...Just goes to show everything is for sale...but the movie itself is true to its form.
B007SGM084|1.0|After all the hype about this book, I thought there might at least be an entertaining story line!!  What a load of garbage obviously enjoyed by people that don't have anything better to do!!<br />Waste of time and money!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. I normally do not enjoy games like this but I am officially hooked to this one. I seem to always be playing it. Great fun. I recommend it.
0545310598|5.0|Product arrived on time and in perfect shape. Exactly as describe in ad.. I will do business with this  dealer again
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive (in a fun way) and somewhat challenging. Excellent graphics for a free game, and the advertisements are not that noticeable. An excellent way to spend a few minutes or longer.
034580404X|1.0|Immature, reads like it was written by a teenager. Same themes written over, and over, and over, and over again.
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|The nice sense of humor and the fresh pheminist approach compensate a little for the fact that the book lacks credibility.
B008OOYALE|4.0|its a great game and its very entertaining, but you have to clear trees, rocks and mushrooms that wipe out all your money and time...overall its pretty good
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is somewhat addictive. However it is a great way to kill an hour while in the car or waiting on the kids from school.  The kids play when we are traveling.<br />I hope new levels come out soon!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Seriously... one of the best apps of its kind. I upgraded within the 1st hour. For $3 why not? I love how easy it is to use. Ill use it for sleeping and I might use it to help put my baby to sleep.
030758836X|1.0|This book was recommended to me by non mystery readers, and now I know why.  OMG!  Talk about much ado over nothing.  and I mean nothing.  No justice, not even poetic justice, and the male character could not have been portrayed as more stupid or idiotic.<br /><br />Sorry.  I had hopes for this, but I wont be reading any of this author's other works.  I hope the folks who make the movie realize how absolutely appalling the ending is and change it!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|my daughter absolutely loved this, no other words to explain. she was counting the days until it came in the mail and it came on time very quickly
B005HSL626|5.0|at first a wasn't sure about the game but when I started yo play it was very good you should definitely get this game
B003UESJH4|5.0|this movie is incredible becuause it inspires those who really have any stutering problem and makes those aware of what stutterers feel in their life on a daily basis, It gives hope for a cure and the entire family should see it, amazing for everyone to see, Great actors and very interesting true story. best best best best movie ever
B00785P2QC|3.0|its a great game for killing time, but the cost of certain things they want you to do for the game is ridiculous

0307592731|4.0|I bought this book because I have aspirations to hike portions of Pacific Crest Trail myself. I expected to achieve this goal vicariously through this account. However, this story is more a personal memoir than an informative travel narrative. Reading Cheryl Stray's reflections upon the too-soon-death of her mother and an abusive, mostly absent father, would benefit any young person struggling to understand and overcome the strangling emotions that come from a difficult beginning. Cheryl does hike 1100 miles from the desert in California to Columbia Gorge in Oregon losing six toe nails in the process. I give her credit for fortitude and stamina. Her writing is crisp, however, it seemed her dialogue was mostly about her devastated feet, deters she made off the trail, the people she met at various rest stops along the way, and her constant cravings for food. I did not expect John Muir's rhapsodic and poetic descriptions of nature, but I was disappointed that Cheryl did not share more of the Wild experience and less of her interaction with other humans. Instead, she took me into her internal monologue of someone on a pilgrimage battling inner demons. I question that whatever lessons she claimed she learned through her flirtations with heroin were worth the dangers of experimenting with that highly addictive drug. She didn't make it to the \\"Range of Light\\" due to deep snow, so I guess I can't know what it is really like to be in John Muir's beloved wonderland unless I make the journey myself.
1612130283|1.0|This book is just so incredibly bad...That you absolutely must read it.<br /><br />It's like Megashark and Evil Dead 2 had a child and then that child was molested by Beneath the Planet of the Apes.  I half expected commentary from Tom Servo.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd like this book for two reasons - YA and poetry.  All I can say is wow!!  The poetry was real and the characters were the kind you want to know better. I laughed, I cried and then referred the book to friends.  Now, I'm off to download the next book.  :-)
1609611543|1.0|Except for the very small percent of people who have a true wheat allergy, this book can be condense down to \\"eat natural foods, not processed food and you will lose weight\\". Nothing new here. Since processed foods are basically sugar, wheat, fats, and perservatives, this author recommends eating lots of vegetables, some fruit, and lots of meats/cheeses. The rest of the book is filler and attempts to make a case against wheat but basically this is a standard low-carb diet book with the same message as almost everyone else.

1466401885|5.0|I'm sorry guys...I'm not really good at writing reviews that leave potiental readers guessing, so beware of possible ***SPOLIERS***!<br /><br />They are dysfunctional as ever, however I LOVED this book. I love the dialogue, Mcguire's writing style, and the characters. Travis, yes he was a walking time bomb and possessive as heck, but he really did care for Abby. Abby, Abby, Abby...what can I say, she wanted her cake and to eat it too! (Parker)<br /><br />America and Shepley's relationship was cute; there were a few time I thought Shepley needed to man up and stop being soooo afraid of losing America because Abby's and Travis' relationship was blossoming.<br /><br />I'm a little concern about Travis and Abby's future because both of them had some serious issues, and they never really talked about their problems. They both need individual counseling, as well as, couples counseling. Travis need for Abby cannot be healthy, and the fact that Abby never dealt with her \\"Daddy issues\\" is a brewing problem. She compares Travis to her father, and I don't think she will stop until she seeks help.<br />I cannot wait to read Walking Disaster; hopefully Travis perspective will elaborate on their relationship a little more.<br /><br />I am also praying for a sequel, since Mcguire already stated on her website that Walking Disaster is not a sequel, just Travis' point of view of their relationship. Hopefully if there is a sequel in the near future, (hint hint) Abby's mother may be introduced, and we will understand more about her life growing up. I really want to know what happens after they are married...There has to be some serious drama because of Travis' dominant ways and Abby's stubbornness.I really would like to see these characters grow and mature together.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I say this movie is an Excellent movie and that every American should take a couple hours out of their day to watch it.  If it was not for the sacrifices of the men and women - past, present, and future - in ALL branches of the United States Military, we would not have the opportunity to watch movies when ever we feel like it. This movie gives the viewer just a taste of what goes on in the life of a Navy Seal, and what his family has to endure while he is away. Some other reviewers have stated the acting in this movie is bad.  I would like to bring to everyones attention that the \\"actors\\" who were portraying these Seals were actual NAVY SEALS - men who train to defend and protect our country and everyone in it, not to ACT.  Please keep this fact in mind while watching this movie.  If you do not believe this fact, then take a moment to watch the credits at the end.  And when you do, make sure you read the name of each and every Navy Seal listed who made the ultimate sacrifice since 9/11,  giving his life so you and I can enjoy ours.  HOOYAH NAVY SEALS !!
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|We almost did not watch this because of all the bad reviews on here, but from the trailer, a few good reviews on here, and the overall write-up, we took a chance.<br /><br />And it's really quite an excellent video.  The ending was great, the story pretty good, and overall, just quite entertaining.<br /><br />The girl really is as good as some others wrote - believable, and you enjoy watching her, anticipating what she is going to do next and how she is going to act in the next situation, which are the marks of a good actor.<br /><br />The superstars in this, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor add to the overall quality.  Channing Tatum (from the dance flick \\"Step Up\\") great to see in a different role.  There's enough intrigue to keep you watching, rewind the video 30 seconds to hear something and pause and then start guessing what might be the reason for something... the marks of a good movie, we think.<br /><br />There's no way this is less than 4 stars.  I give it 5 to try and bring the overall rating back up.  Again, the very ending is great, too.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|You should have done it a long time ago! This cd is amazing. Brings me to tears sometimes. I bought this one and Transatlanticism, both are worth purchasing over and over.
B003ODHOA4|2.0|This book gives some phrases that are useful for hanging out with Chinese friends but has lots of useless fluff.  Why call this DIRTY CHINESE if half the book is about sports, food, and culture vocabulary?  It doesn't give good ideas of context as to where and how to use lots of these words and phrases, and the presentation is very scattered.
0618001905|5.0|The war in the Congo continues to take lives. What is the background? Why does this country have such a bloody history? The Belgians left chaos in their wake in this country. The book is fascinating at many levels. It is a stark  story of the rapacious policies of King Leopold who personally profited at the expense of the inhabitants of this place, which was so rich in resources. Read about the early human rights activists, using photos for the first time to make a human rights story. Great read.

B00003CX5P|3.0|When I first saw \\"The Phantom Menace\\" in the theaters, I turned to the person I saw it with and said with disgust, \\"I can't believe I waited 16 years for this.\\" Having seen the movie for the first time in years, I cannot say it was as bad as some of its harshest critics insist but it is nowhere near as good as its defenders maintain.<br /><br />Having watched the DVD, I came to the conclusion that George Lucas attempted to make a movie trying to appeal to two different audiences--members of Generation X who were children when the original trilogy came out and younger kids. Frankly, it undermines the movie. Kids will be turned off by confusing and usually boring hints of political machinations and parliamentary procedure. Adults will find Jar Jar Binks jarring instead of amusing and quickly find Jake Lloyd's role of young Anakin Skywalker grating. While the special effects are impressive, plot and character matter and that is where the movie is lacking.<br /><br />That is not to say there are some redeeming features. The special effects are generally impressive and some of the battle scenes--especially the final light saber duel--are solid.<br /><br />The DVD has a host of deleted scenes, most of which would not have added to the film, including making the already long podracing scene stretch on for even more time. There are several documentaries and interviews as well.<br /><br />With Lucas toying and tinkering with the film--again--the DVD is hard to find on the retail market. Some of the prices currently being asked for--$50 and higher--are absurd.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Prometheus marks Ridley Scott's first science-fiction film since Blade Runner 30 years ago and returns to the universe of his seminal, 1979 masterpiece [[ASIN:B00498VS1E Alien]]. The question over whether or not this is actually a prequel to Alien (as was originally intended) has been thoroughly exhausted at this point and ultimately irrelevant. You need not have seen any other film to appreciate, admire, and enjoy Scott's latest sci-fi venture. Prometheus takes place in the same universe and references Scott's earlier film, but it really does function as a stand-alone film. With a budget somewhere between $120 and $130 million, there is little to separate Prometheus from a typical summer blockbuster. What ultimately does separate it is Ridley Scott, a man gifted in making big films with big ideas. There is enough action and visual effects to please the average moviegoer, but Prometheus is backed by an intelligent script that asks a lot of questions, answers few of them, and gives us something to ponder instead of just mindlessly blowing things up. Take that, Michael Bay.<br /><br />The hypnotic opening sequence (shot in Iceland) shows a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall, drinking a mysterious liquid that induces vomiting and rapid decay. This scene is ambiguous in that it gives us no information about where he is, what he is, and or what the implications of this moment are. It intrigues us for a moment, before the film jump cuts to the year 2089. Here, archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) has discovered a star map among wall paintings from several unrelated cultures that she views as an invitation from the Engineers that may have created human life. Funded by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, Shaw and a crew embark on a voyage to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the vessel Prometheus. Travelling in stasis and monitored by the android David (Michael Fassbender), they arrive in 2093 and embark on their mission to find their creators.<br /><br />Despite taking place in the same universe as Alien, the world created by the extravagant sets in Prometheus evoke a world all its own. The sets are intricately designed, large-scale creations; early contenders for the best set design Academy Award next year. Scott masterfully blends large sets, special effects, and good location scouting to create an atmospheric new world. If Prometheus offered nothing else by way of quality, it's an amazing film to look at.<br /><br />It recalls Alien most noticeably in that both have a strong female protagonist and both emphasize patient, slow-burning suspense, atmosphere, and an intelligent script that equally balances a complex narrative with beautifully integrated special effects. Prometheus does not jump directly in to the action. You'll be intrigued before you'll be amazed. In a genre that frequently allows acting prowess to take a backseat to hyperkinetic imagery, you'll find some fine performances here too.<br /><br />Fassbender, always the fascinating actor, wonderfully captures the ambiguous emotions of his android character. His performance is sophisticated, robotic, and yet layered with depth. It's as if HAL-9000 had assumed the look of T.S. Lawrence and was allowed to freely wander the ship. It's a performance that hurtles him ever-closer to the A-list. Rapace makes a strong, sensitive substitute for Sigourney Weaver and Charlize Theron sternly embodies a character that metaphorically holds the entire narrative subtext together.<br /><br />Prometheus is imperfect, but these flaws are few and far between. Sure, fanboys may find fault with how it works chronologically with Alien (despite the fact that it's not a prequel officially), but my issues come from two much different aspects. One is Guy Pearce's makeup. When compared to the seamless visual effects, his makeup seems unconvincing and overdone. Granted, I didn't initially recognize Pearce, but I also didn't believe that Peter Weyland was anelderly man. Another issue comes from something I've already praised; the script. As intelligent and thought-provoking as it is, it doesn't offer anything new by way of story structure. It follows the template seen in Alien and more recently in Sunshine (as well as, I assume, several movies in-between). It just follows too many cues that the seasoned moviegoer will recognize right away (establish reason for mission, upon arrival there's a change in the mission, the characters begin exploring, ominous things happen, characters get scared and die unbeknownst to the others, etc.). Sure, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have fashioned something spectacular, but it wouldn't hurt to break from the template and create something wholly new.<br /><br />Minor issues aside, it's terrific summer entertainment and a roaring return for Ridley Scott to the genre in which he made his name. Prometheus is a terrific film and one of the better high-minded science-fiction films to emerge from Hollywood in several years. It has suspense, horror, intelligence, drama, and depth typically eschewed in favor of a special effects extravaganza during Hollywood blockbuster season.
0061726834|5.0|I was hesitant to read a book that focuses on love, but I am so happy I gave Lauren Oliver a try. This was a great story, and I have already uploaded the next book to my ereader. I will be starting this book as soon as I complete this review. I don't think I have anything else to add that hasn't been written by other 5 star reviewers. Definitely read this book. It is a great read, and the ending provides so much emotion and suspense. I \\"LOVE\\" this book. ;-)
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I did not have high hopes for Men in Black 3. The first film was a staple of my childhood, but its 2002 sequel was a major disappointment that's best forgotten. While my initial expectations were optimistic, I grew cynical when I heard that filming had commenced without a completed script. Ten years removed from the previous installment, it seemed like this film was a way of cashing in on an established brand...Like Will Smith really needs the money. Well, color me surprised. This third film in the franchise not only stands shoulder to shoulder with the first, but it boasts an entertaining and well-plotted script. Considering the troubled production, Men in Black 3 is some kind of miracle.<br /><br />The film opens at LunarMax Prison, a high-security facility located on the moon. Housed there is Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), the last surviving member of an extinct alien race, who escapes with the intention of going back in time to kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) before K is able to shoot off Boris' arm and capture him. After K learns of Boris' escape, all traces of him disappear and Boris launches a large-scale attack on Earth. With Agent J (Smith) being the only one with any recollection of K, he must time-jump back to 1969 to save him and all of humanity. J is warned to specifically avoid K and to come back to the present after he's killed the present-day Boris. Following a clue to Coney Island, J is apprehended by the young Agent K (Josh Brolin). Explaining the situation, K reluctantly believes him and the two find themselves working together to stop the present and past Boris from carrying out his plan.<br /><br />Time travel is a tricky subject in any medium. There are a lot of kinks that must be worked out to create a cohesive and consistent narrative. Are there plot holes in Men in Black 3? Certainly. But it's not a movie that lends itself to in-depth analysis of its plot structure. The time travel stuff is handled remarkably well (excuses can be found for many of the discrepancies) and it's so clever and paced so well that any plot holes can be easily overlooked. Etan Cohen's script has creative ideas, a great sense of humor, well-developed (although kitschy) moments of drama, and a tongue-in-cheek self-awareness. While the second film proved a good script is a necessity, the magic of this franchise and the secret to its charm and longevity are rooted in the confident direction of Barry Sonnenfeld, the chemistry between the principal actors, and the wonderfully creative designs of the aliens that populate the story.<br /><br />Those in charge of designing the aliens for this movie have reached deep into their well of creativity here. Whether it's the main antagonist or the background characters; there's a lot to admire here. Even better, there's more subtlety than the previous installment and the aliens here are fascinating without having to try as hard as the second film's Balchinian.<br /><br />While Jones doesn't have much screen time, he and Smith still have great chemistry. They're certainly an odd pairing, but it's hard not to smile during their charismatic and witty banter. Smith has his share of hilarious moments and reminds you why (even after a 3 year absence from acting) he's one of the biggest actors in the world. Josh Brolin has been earning rave reviews for his role as Young Agent K and this praise is more than deserved as does something totally unheard of. It would've been easy for the filmmakers to throw Tommy Lee Jones in some prosthetics or cast someone completely unlike him. Instead, they cast Brolin and he's extraordinary. He manages to not only look exactly how one would imagine a young Tommy Lee Jones, but he physically embodies him perfectly and he sounds exactly like him. This is one of the few times I can recall being convinced that I'm watching the younger version of a character and not just a different actor playing the younger version. Even more remarkable is that Brolin isn't just doing a really good Tommy Lee Jones impression; he actually brings depth out of the character in a way that wonderfully complements Jones' performance. Many have said you should see the movie just for Brolin's performance. I'm in the camp that will point to other reasons, but for a role that could've been a novelty act; he's truly impressive.<br /><br />Sonnenfeld began as a cinematographer, transitioned into directing with The Addams Family in 1991 and has been a hit-or-miss filmmaker ever since. He deserves a wealth of praise for undertaking this massive project without a script or proper preparation and delivering a worthy sequel and an entertaining summer blockbuster. It was a gamble, which makes this accomplishment all the more remarkable.<br /><br />I had so much fun watching Men in Black 3 that I can find very little to criticize. Boris, while much better than Lara Flynn Boyle's villain, can be annoying at times. He's a revolting, effective villain but here personal taste collides with objective criticism. It doesn't help that has some of the most ham-fisted dialogue in the film. Aside from this, Men in Black 3 is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's terrific entertainment and one of those rare moments where a sequel actually rivals the original film. More importantly, Men in Black 3 is a successful reparation for the abominable sequel ten years ago. I actually vote they remove the second film from the canon and re-title this film Men in Black 2. While it's been overshadowed a bit this summer season, Men in Black 3 is the most entertaining film I've seen this year and, if you're a fan of the series, you won't want to miss it.
