B0084QQWK4|5.0|Stephen Greenblatt's writing is fluid and eminently readable. The story is a true pager turner and Mr. Greenblat's research brings to life details of the life and times of the hero of the story, Pogio Bracciolini that had me believing I was in his company. I recommend this book to all my friends
B008220DGE|3.0|Accolades and Oscar nominations aside, I found the Master disappointing. Not because of its cinematography, sharp writing, or superb performances, but simple because I don't know what this film is suppose to be about. Or perhaps is simply isn't about what I want(ed) it to be about. It feels like Paul Thomas Anderson (a director whose work I appreciate immensely) wanted to make a movie about a broken, listless World War II veteran and take a fictional stab at the founding of Scientology. And yet, he wasn't brave enough to commit to either. Could Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) been a cipher for so many returning Veteran's facing the(then little understood) effects of PTSD? Yes, but he really wasn't. He was personally self destructive. Could he have been indicative of the lost souls attracted to \\"Cult\\" like personalities as embodied by the Master (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)? Yes, but he really wasn't because even he finds shallow fleeting comfort in \\"The Cause,\\" P.T. Anderson's stand in for Scientology. Perhaps it finds soft purchase thematically because Anderson doesn't want to alienate the Hollywood Elite enamored with utterly ridiculous Church of Scientology. Or perhaps he told the story exactly as he wanted to and it failed to resonate with me. Of note is Phoenix's complete physical transformation. Have you ever seen someone coming in shadow and recognized them because of posture and gait? Imagine reshaping your own dramatically. Phoenix does this. His character has a staggeringly persistent stance and manner that only a brilliant actor could truly accomplish. You also see the rigors of age, a hard lived life, and poor health further distort the character's physicality. Its a fantastic transformation.

B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Let's look at a brief history of what the horror films have brought us through the decades, shall we? After the Universal Monsters had all their eerie night in the dark, British sensibilities brought us the Gothic ghost horrors of the fifties and early sixties. Then the late sixties and seventies brought us a slate of movies involving secret satanic rituals and demonic possessions (which reflected real national fears of such societies according to polls at the time). The late seventies and eighties gave birth to the unstoppable killing machine of the slasher flicks and their near infinite variations. The nineties were a period of nostalgic retreads with the only lasting sub genre being the \\"found footage\\" films that splashed into widespread success with the hit The Blair Witch Project. Currently, Hollywood makes any variation or combination of the above sub genres- possession and found footage films clearly the most popular. Sinister says, \\"why not combine all of those genre's into one film.\\" And it does it well. The film lives off the strength of Ethan Hawke's character, true crime fiction writer Ellison. It contains a powerful and compelling narrative that unfolds with the proper taunt amount of pacing, stronger than most horror films. It has some disturbingly real and grisly visuals unrestrained by its PG-13 rating thanks entirely to clever film making. While no horror movie ever really scares me, those images stuck with me which is a testament to its quality. The ending was telegraphed and the reveal of a certain supernatural element in the climax of the second act seemed technically lacking, but other than that the film is strong. Frankly, its probably one of my top ten horror films of the last decade... at least this week. All those lists are constantly fluctuating.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The fact that John Green makes Hazel so truthful about everything is why I love this book. It doesn't shield you from the horrific things that take place in our world. This book helps you embrace them. It shows you to see things the way they really are and not throw a fit because of them. This book deserves endless applause but I leave you with one thing, Okay? Okay.

B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Its almost like every western ever made led to this masterpiece by Sergio Leone. He arguably made his greatest \\"Spaghetti western\\" attempting to swear off the genre. I could easily write 500 words or more on this film- not the least of is the brilliant way in which Leone referenced westerns of days past and the fundamental way this film affected some great artists of today (notably Quentin Tarantino and the makers of the western video game opus Red Dead Redemption). While initially a flop, it is considered one of the greats of all time. Here are a few reasons I love it.<br />It has the quintessential element I love about late 60s and 70s films- the lack of over-explanation rife in today's movies. Things are given time to build, slowly intentionally. The motivations of our principle villains are not revealed until AN HOUR into the film. The opening scene is slow and methodical, with almost no dialog or music. Characters are build through reaction and small moments that hang on the screen. Scenic vistas and quiet encounters are suddenly punctuated by brief violence. Tension is expertly built. Casting is magnificent- as perinatal Western hero plays a great bad guy, Charles Bronson plays his typical quiet and menacing, while Jason Robards steals almost every scene he is in. The dialog is sparse and utilitarian- but often unforgettable. Even the railroad baron, the most vile of western bad guys, is complex. Time is taken to allow the audience to understand his misguided motivations. It is a somber methodical masterpiece and certainly not for every movie or even western fan, but the subtle way in which Once Upon a Time in the West characterizes and epitomizes the death of legendary time in American history and in a way punctuates the death of traditional Western cinema.

B0067EKYS6|4.0|Saw The Great Gatsby and find myself profoundly affected by it. It's been 18 years since I've read Gatsby and while its themes of \\"the American dream,\\" excess, classism, and societal conventions are intact in Baz Luhrmann's adaptation, it also left with a great emptiness. It is as if I've watched a beautiful watercolor being painted before my eyes. At times vibrant, frenetic and bombastic, often slowing to perfect the intricacies. Then a sudden deluge washes the beauty away, as colors are mottled to grays and browns, streaking the canvas and blurring a picture that was more illusion than reality. In so doing, I've taken the journey of Jay Gatsby and Nick Carraway- impermanence, futility, hope, beauty, and the impossibility of redemption. Time marches ever forward and our beacons are ever beyond our grasp, not because of time or distance, merely because the beacon isn't what we imagine it to be.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Most bands, when they release an album, only one or two good track listings to its name. Record labels know this, as this is why &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; remix albums exist. Gorillaz is no exception. I am a fan of Gorillaz not because both of their previous albums were perfect (they weren't), but because they included some truly great gems embedded in a sound I've never heard anywhere else before or since.<br /><br />Enter Plastic Beach, which continues to deliver the promise of Gorillaz to introduce strange and unusual combination of sounds. This album isn't just a good album, with a few identifiable tracks, but it is a GREAT album, with each song producing a tropical, ethereal quality that is as haunting as it is alluring. Even the stranger listings, such as &#34;Superfast Jellyfish&#34; arrests the attention of the discerning listener, with the allusions to oceanic pollution disguised with cheery beats and rhymes against the sound of an obvious parody of corporate food moguls and their commercials.<br /><br />Every song on this album has merit and shows just how far Gorillaz has come in terms of refining its sound. It is definitely worth the price of purchase and I recommend it to any Gorillaz fan, musician, or the casual music lover looking for something different.

B008B1BL4E|5.0|I had always heard that Germany started WWI. It wasn't that simple. Christopher Clark documents the complex interaction colonial ambitions, the decline of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, the French fear of the rapid growth of German power, and a French-led &#34;defensive&#34; alliance with Russia and Great Britain created an unstable situation in Europe where the leaders of France and Russia thought that it was in their best interests to go to war with Germany before Germany grew even more powerful. It was a powder keg awaiting a spark.

I was frankly hoping for a little more given the raw ingredients and potential.  It was worth watching but \\"nice\\" is the best description I can think of for this prequel to the 1939 classic, which even today is still a better all around film.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I won't go into detail about this release, Sabbath fans (I'm a relatively new one) will like this album a lot I believe.  It delivers on every level, lyrics, riffs, performance, songs and production (production is AMAZING). It has all the classic elements that made them great initially.<br /><br /> My BIG PROBLEM is the marketing schemes.  First of all, here we go again. Best Buy has an excellent bonus track that is not on this deluxe version.  It is well worth having...possibly one of the strongest songs on the album.  WHY WHY WHY, the \\"bonus track\\"  marketing...and on a separate CD?????  The Best Buy version with 4 bonus tracks could fit with the album on one disc EASILY!!  I feel very sorry for all the Sabbath fans who buy the \\"deluxe\\" version here only to find they've been screwed out of a great bonus track that is on the BB version.  This has happened to me previously on other releases and I was pissed!  At LEAST they could have had just one release with the 3 bonus tracks alongside the album on ONE disc...(4 easily).<br /><br />C'mon Black Sabbath or who ever is in control.  You bands (or those that represent you) should appreciate your die hard fans who have supported your creative efforts all these years and this is the way you thank them???<br />Of course, Sabbath are not the only band (release) guilty of this.  Paul McCartney has been doing this big time for sometime now...and he HAS to have control over his release right?  At least David Bowie put the bonus tracks on the same disc instead of this 2 disc nonsense (I'm talking about when they can easily fit of course).  Maybe it's the labels and the artists have no control...I don't know.  It seems to me an act like Sabbath/McCartney would have enough clout to tell the label not to do this and give their fans a fair shake.  That's my opinion.  This is not whining...this is a serious issue I believe.<br /><br />Other than that...the album is awesome!

B0000AUHPG|2.0|I'd go with 2.5 stars. This movie is Leone after being Sergio Leone has gone to his head. First, the positives:<br /><br />Fonda sits around well and stands around very well.<br />Cardinale beautiful despite too much makeup and garish lighting.<br />Great hats. Leone has a hell of an eye for hats.<br />Some striking and effective scenes in the beginning.<br /><br />Negatives-<br /><br />-Unoriginal. The movie is admittedly and deliberately a bunch of samples from other movies.  Most of all, it's Leone sampling of himself. (Homages or references in movie talk.)<br />-Bronson is boring. As usual.<br />-Ponderous. Stilted delivery of dialogue. Overblown score. Everything is turned into an ersatz icon or a make believe myth.<br />\\"Harmonica.\\"  Gimme a break.<br />-Treatment of RR building (-9) vapid in comparison to treatment of Civil War in Good/Bad/Ugly (+10)<br /><br />Leone made this \\"incented\\" by Hollywood after he correctly decided to stop making westerns. And it looks it.  It looks and feels as if he said, \\"You want Sergio?  I give you Sergio! One hundred eighty-five minutes slo-mo Sergio on steroids!\\" Imagine the consternation of studio execs presented with three hours of slog through mountainous faces.<br /><br />I have run algorithms derived by Wall Street (always right) against this and a few other movies.  The finding is: Unforgiven is 12.675 times better then Once Upon a Time, and Good/Bad/Ugly is 14.8 times better, with Good/Bad coming in as the Best Western ever made.  Why?  Tonal range. Richness of language (Wallach's rants). It's beautiful: the photography is the original of Once Upon a Time's so it's actually fresh, and it's much more fluid.  Eastwood as hero vs. Bronson as hero. Treatment of backdrop: Civil War (huge, tragic, ironic) vs. Railroad Building (reduced to Claudia Cardinale's eyes with too much eye-liner.) Much greater complexity of story - and much, much more, all for the same price.<br /><br />Definitely a cult film, way overrated, but afilm one should see simply to have seen it.

B00499QUK2|5.0|A fantastic first season for one of the world's best detectives. The first episode shows how quickly Sherlock and John grow attached to each other, and John's unashamed amazement at Sherlock's powers of deduction is wonderful. The end of the first episode is just funny when Sherlock starts describing who would have been able to make such a shot between two buildings, then he spots John standing innocently behind the crime scene tape and promptly shuts up, telling the police to ignore everything he just said because he doesn't want John to get in trouble for saving him. The second episode is alright. It's probably my least favorite of all the episodes, but it's still pretty good. It shows a bit of what John has to put up with, living with Sherlock, and how hard it is for him to try and have a normal relationship outside of him and Sherlock. But John is always willing to go and help Sherlock, no matter how annoying he gets sometimes! The last episode is really cool, introducing Moriarty, the &#34;consulting criminal.&#34; He makes a game for Sherlock to play, saving lives by solving crimes impossible for anyone else to solve in the short amount of time he's given. It's fantastic. Moriarty, when he finally comes in at the end, is really weird. I don't like him all that much, but there's no question that he's a genius. And warning, the cliff hanger at the end of season one is a horrible place to stop watching. I'd make sure you have access to the second season before watching the last episode in season one!

B00BHMETKC|5.0|We decided to watch this because the price was still 3.99 and it won best picture.  I thought that I would only be marginally interested because historical films are not my favorite genre.  However, this film was gripping even though I am old enough to remember this time in history.  Rent it, you won't be disappointed.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this season! They put a cool twist on some very famous Sherlock Holmes stories: Irene Adler, the Hounds of Baskerville, and the Reichenbach Falls. Irene Adler turns out to be a dominatrix and Mycroft tries to use Sherlock to get some compromising photos back from her. He is unsuccessful, of course, since the story is Adler is the one woman who was able to fool Sherlock. This episode is probably my favorite of the entire series because of how all these little pieces of the puzzle fall into place at the end; the play between Sherlock and Irene gets very complicated (luckily they explain most of it at the end). The very end is really cute, too, when you finally see how much Sherlock really likes her.<br /><br />The Hounds of Baskerville had some really good John and Sherlock moments. One of my favorite parts is when Sherlock says to John, &#34;I don't have friends. I just have one.&#34; Adorable! John doesn't have a very good episode, what with Sherlock drugging him and basically using him as a lab rat without telling John, but luckily John is very forgiving. It's also interesting when Sherlock is telling John he's never not been able to rely on his own senses after he sees the gigantic hound which cannot possibly exist.<br /><br />The Reichenbach fall is a very depressing episode, I'm not going to lie. Moriarty returns and sets his plan into motion to burn Sherlock. Although I hate Moriarty, I do have to admit the way he goes about doing it is brilliant (which Sherlock also appreciates, even when it's ruining him). I love John in this episode because he refuses to believe what the media is saying about Sherlock. This episode is a roller coaster of emotions, and the end is just awful. There are numerous theories of what actually happened, but no one really knows yet; it really sucks the third season STILL isn't out, but it is coming at the end of 2013, so our wait is almost over!

B00BEYYEE4|2.0|\\"Broken City\\" is a movie where the trailers really made me want to see this movie in the theaters, but I never got around to it.<br /><br />I picked the Blu-ray up on sale for 15 bucks or so at Target thinking that with the cast (despite some hit and miss movies, I've really come too like Mark Wahlerg and think he's a very capable actor, and Russell Crowe is usually pretty good) it had to be worth the price.  Truth be told, I wish I'd spent just the ten bucks in the theaters nstead of buying the movie for 15.<br /><br />I went into this movie really wanting to like it, really believing that I would.  Is \\"Broken City\\" a bad movie? No?  But it's not a particularly good movie, either.  That's really the major problem.  There's absolutely nothing about the movie that differentiates itself from the hundreds of other movies just like it: crime dramas with a twist ending, someone gets double-crossed by someone they thought they could trust, one person thinks they hold the cards only to find out someone else is holding an even better hand.  It's a plot device that we see at least ten times a year in the theaters. And \\"Broken City\\" doesn't even feature any outstanding performances to make up for the over-used plot devices.<br /><br />Heck, even if the movie were spectacularly bad, at least it would provide something worthy of conversation.  But all it is is just an OK popcorn flick...nothing more, nothing less.  Something to rent and pass a Saturday morning with. Just another movie on Russell Crowe's filmography.<br /><br />This movie will be forgotten in a year, if not sooner.  If you must see it, rent it from the red-box.

The format of the book is unusual and captivating, mirroring the mind of the struggling main character.

B000I186FW|4.0|Incredibly much of the dialogue of the sinister Chancellor and his minions reminded me of what is going on right now in our government and the media, which can only be overcome when people understand that ideas matter.  That is the message of the movie - very worthwhile viewing.

B004BLDD9Y|1.0|The lightbulb shipped was a bright white instead of a warm white, and as mentioned on another review it does get hot.  It's a nice alternative to CFL's for less energy use.<br /><br />EDIT:  About 4 months after having it, using it perhaps 4-6 hours at most a day, the LED's have started to malfunction and flicker on and off every 1-3 seconds.  Considering I don't want my living room looking like a club with the lights flashing on and off, the lightbulb is now useless and far short of it's advertised lifespan (and that of most LED's) so it was not worth what was paid.<br /><br />After searching longer I found these LED bulbs that are not only a better price, but I've bought about 32 of them so far and they've all lasted the 2-3 years since I bought them with ZERO issues.

An application a non tech dummy can love.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I'm a big fan of this author but this was a bit of a departure having a young girl involved in the story. But it worked very well.  I found myself picturing Natalie Portman in the film \\"The Professional\\".<br /><br />The story is intriguing with a few twists and turns as well as the occasional predictable scenarios. But on balance it was perfect escapist reading from an always exceptional author.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you see only one movie this year, this is the one to see.  There are so many emotions wrapped up in this movie ... and for young girls/women looking for that special someone ... you will only want a &#34;man of courage&#34; in your life!
0307593312|5.0|This book lived up to my every expectation and hope. Without giving any of the story away.....<br />I've read a lot of Murakami, liked it all, loved some of it. This is love.<br />The story and characters are fantastical, mysterious, mystical... Total puzzles and predictable at the same time. The world Murakami paints is so rich and lush you're drawn in immediately and start rooting for your favorites.<br />The length is daunting, but I was wishing there was more for me when I reached the last page.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. I think my teenager would love it too.  Not a difficult read but a lot of interesting questions are raised.
B008JFUMHE|5.0|This movie more than exceeded my already high expectations. It really irks me that the average review is only a 3.8; THIS is misleading, not the trailers as I saw in another review. This movie is brilliantly original and a bang of an ending. LOVED it.

B003UESJHO|4.0|IF you like boxing there is probably not enough boxing in this if you don't like boxing there is too much.  But the story itself is wonderful about living up to one's own potential and not down to other's, including family, expectations.  I love Amy Adams performance in this movie, not only does she get the accent and cadence of the Boston area but the subtle defensiveness that comes from that area.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Played on a B&O RX2 TT w/ B&O RL140 speakers. Immense dynamic range and so many funky beats. Worth it.
0425263991|5.0|I was a little worried that so much of the book was kept secret for so long.... but I should never have doubted Nalini's writing genius. The past few books in the series have had little bits and pieces that made me question if Kaleb Krychek could be the infamous Ghost in the Net. It's a relief to not only find out the truth behind his actions, but to know I wasn't crazy in my imaginings. Singh spins a story filled with twists and turns as changing as the maze Sahara once created with her mind. I couldn't put the book down once I began. In fact, I waited until I knew I would have several free hours before even opening the cover flap. I wanted NOTHING to interfere with my reading time. And I am so thankful I did that.<br /><br />From start to finish, this book had me hooked. I can't wait for the next book in the series, so we can learn what the shattering of Silence truly means to the Psy and their world. How many connections will be revealed once the stranglehold they have on their feelings is released? For my part, I believe there are already several (currently invisible) threads connecting families within the Net. After all, we know Nikita isn't as Silent as she pretends. Nor is Anthony or the Nightstar clan. Sophie is still hooked to the Net as well. The anticipation of what Singh can and will do next with the series is exciting; and the it will likely drive me crazy as I wait for the next book. Until then, I will content myself with rereading the series at least three times.
B0051OZ564|4.0|The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it wasn't quite as sexy as I had anticipated. It is a very creative and action packed movie that is unique in its creation and conception. The story line was different than I expected based on the adverts but I was in no way disappointed. I really liked the uniqueness of this crazy land, rebellious, raw, dark, and tenacious self preservation concept.
B005CFWHCC|4.0|This sandal, while very flattering on the foot, has a top strap that is just too tight on the foot and leaves a mark across my skin. I keep hoping that it will stretch a bit, but so far it hasn't (probably a good thing for most people).  This could be a design flaw (although the other croc sandals I own do not do this), or it could be a result of my large wide foot? Length-wise they are perfect and the cushioning and stress-busting nubs on all my crocs is THE best...I can live with a little tightness I think.  Hence the 4 stars instead of 5
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I love this program. It allows me to sync my laptop to-do lists with my kindle so I have them when I'm out and about or don't want to get on my laptop. It's a great way to keep myself organized and knowing whats due when.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I ordered this by mistake on a rainy day, but ended up being unable to now watch the whole series in the afternoon. The acting and storyline were well done.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. She has a style of writing that keeps you interested. I almost want to go hiking now myself.
0061353248|5.0|One of my top ten favorite books ever.  If you have any interest in the topic  of how people make decisions, then you must read this book.  It's one of the few books I have ever read twice and I even took his class on this topic online through Duke for free. Whether you are in sales, PR, organizational behavior, management or just want to improve your own personal decision making, Ariely's insights, stories and high level research will shift your understanding.  At the same time the book is a very easy read with many entertaining facts and reflections.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome game, lots of fun. Kids and I enjoy playing this game. The puzzles are fun, and challenging. I enjoy the side commentary from the background characters. Totally worth the money.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app has everything you need in a weather app. You can customize everything. I had a small issue when I downloaded this app. I contacted the developer, he got back to me right away and solved the problem immediately. Great weather app and developer.
B00004W50T|5.0|&#34; big pink&#34; is my 2nd favorite album ever, next, obviously, to&#34; dark side of the moon&#34;. I saw the first tour when the album was debuted. Dylan made his first appearance after his bike wreck for the encore. my only complaint is that the original album cover should have been kept. the bonus cuts are also excellent, particulary, &#34; long distance operator&#34;.
B006S08RLU|5.0|I've heard of this movie long ago, but why have I waited all these years to watch it? Oh well, the first impression is: \\"What is that?\\". What an amazing movie; the story, the acting, the creativity, the characters, the music and the colors are just perfect. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever watched. There is so much culture in it. The imagination is awesome, it just takes you everywhere, and makes you feel you are one of the characters in this movie. I so want to live where Amelie lives, it is just so beautiful her apartment by the way. This movie made me smile :) Don't hesitate, go and watch it, you'll love it.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Wonderful history of the band that pulls no punches. Excellent music throughout. Fascinating inside look at both the band, the other artists and writers of the time, and the music industry in that era. An ugly business, but these men always have, and still, deliver the goods. One of the best, if not the best, bands of all time.

B005JR3Y5W|5.0|This show encompasses dry wit, and the funny side of successes & failures. The cast has a chemistry that produces a feel of natural friendship & a desire to understand each other no matter how strange.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game. The game<br />Moves really fast. That's how you get better at it. It also takes you to different citys
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I was so pleased to get this CD, having always been an Anka fan.  But this outdoes everything he has done in recent years.  I just love hearing him with current artists and the selection of songs is very good.

B00CQGU9GG|5.0|This is a great box set, and it's really fun to begin with their First Album and work your way to Recycler.  I'm half way there and having a ball.  10 albums for $40 is a steal.  And, don't worry about people complaining about the mastering; these albums sound just fine, if not better than fine.  I've listened to the first five through headphones, streaming them from a desktop, and listened on my trusty OPPO 83SE , and I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />HDtracks will sell you the 96/24 files for $130 for the set.  The CD version is not a bad deal.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am watching the TV series and now reading the book and understand why they made a series out of it. The book helps fill in questions and gives so munch more detail. It's just as they always say, the book is better!
B009AMANBA|2.0|Very disappointed with this film.  Nothing covered except political details that I could care less about, only bright spot was Sally Field as Mary Todd but she wasnt on much...Neither was Robert?
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|A very good movie that, regardless of your religious beliefs, makes a strong statement about what lies beyond this life and how differant people react to this idea.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game. Just needs to have updates. But I bet in a year or so it will be the computer/Xbox.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|A scathing look at drug addiction and how it affects several lives. Ellen Burstyn's performance is great-however- Darren Aronofsky's direction is an aquired taste to say the least. I call it directing with a Blowtorch!

B000067IZ3|4.0|A terrific film-if a bit long-that explores several sides of the &#34;war on drugs&#34; of the 1980s. Good perfomances all around and good direction.
B004SBQALA|1.0|My daughter hated it. She read the book and loves the series. But there are too many things wrong in the movie- important things. I know the movies are always different from the books, but whoever wrote the screenplay- I don't think they read the book.

B007N8RULO|5.0|I pay it all the time and would recommend to others. You can make it harder if you like and break different scores
193700788X|4.0|I only liked it because it drew story lines together and to a close. I wish, I wish with all my heart the Sookie series had kept up the quality the first books had. After the TV series came out they changed. A lot.
B001UU6XPA|5.0|Stunning storytelling, with great stylized art to go along with it. Fresh bande desinee-style sketches that are warm, even when they're violent, and the story strums along, picking up with Bruce Wayne coming back into town after 18 years away training on the top of a mountain, with a young Jim Gordon coming into town with a pregnant wife, up against a corrupt commissioner and his creepy henchman Flass. Great story about Gordon's encounter with corrupt cops who don't want him causing trouble, and then his revenge on them; at the same time, Bruce Wayne's on a mission in the corrupt East End, where he tries to take down a pimp while in disguise - not the scary avenger garb of the Batman, but some leather duds and some face paint (a fake scar) to throw people off the scent. It's a failure. But Wayne learns. He also comes across Selina Kyle, the Catwoman. Nice. There's the first appearance of the psychopath Branden and his SWAT team, a hostage taker that Gordon takes out single-handedly, paralleled with a near-failure from Bruce Wayne as the caped crusader. Gordon meets Sarah Essen, the Batman takes on the crime bosses, he gets trapped in an abandoned building with the cops chasing him, he makes fools of all of them. It would make a great movie!<br />The book builds and cooks, seemingly not very real in its depictions, but of so real in its situations and emotions. There is nothing truly clumsy about the story developments, and it's very mature throughout.<br /><br />The bonus materials at the end of the book are also very good, showing artist David Mazzucchelli's submission samples to DC from 1981 and 1983, as well as a cute little thing that he drew when he was six yeas old in 1966.
0307341550|5.0|i had read Gone Girl 1st (disliked the axis2 vs axis2 theme). This was an axis2 I could more sympathize/pity and was a more enjoyable book. The mystery itself was fascinatinggood beach read!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Good read! Complex, heartbreaking, funny.  A book that you won't soon forget. In depth and realistic characters help to send a message about love, compassion, and the consequences of indifference towards those in most in need
0060872675|5.0|This was my four month old grandchild's first Father's Day gift to his Daddy. He'll love it. I do. Thanks.
B006RXQ27O|5.0|Another film where the bad guys are only in it for, ah, the money. Intimately reconstructed Los Angeles of the 1940s, where people said things like \\"who needs a car in LA, we've got the best public transportation system in the world.\\" Wild noir stuff, contrasted with goofy kids stuff. \\"A toon killed his brother. Dropped a pianio on his head.\\" Wild Donald versus Daffy sequence... with guns. \\"Can anybody underthtand what thith duck ith th-th-thaying?\\" Flipping patty-cake photos imitate animation - very cleverly meta-cinematographic. Baby Herman is over the top - \\"my problem is I got a 50-year-old's lust and a three-year-old's dinky.\\" Toon violence, shave-and-a-haircut two bits. Eddie grabs Delores' shirt. Freaky deaky ending very screamingly weird, man!<br /><br />The film comes with great extras: Deleted \\"Pighead\\" scene, which includes weird equipment Bob Hoskins had to wear on set. \\"Tummy Trouble\\" short with Nurse Jessica and all the syringe insanity, and a killer sadistic Droopy. \\"Roller Coster Rabbit\\", featuring the world's most psychotic roller coster. Hostage Jessica, Snidely Droopy says \\"Curses, foiled again.\\" \\"What's the matter, toots, afraid of a little... bang?\\" \\"Trail Mixiup\\" shows Ranger Jessica. Between legs shot: \\"Only you can prevent forest fires\\" in sexy voice. Most back office guys who give comments in the special features have facial hear - mustaches at least, or full beards. Why is that? The guy who did the voice of Roger Rabbit wore a Roger Rabbit costume while he did his voice acting. One year of post production, no CG!!!<br /><br />I love you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit.<br /><br />Jessica is somewhere in between a human and a toon. The sneak previews were bad. Zemekis had final cut, he didn't budge on it. The film was called by many who were on the cast and crew as \\"difficult to make.\\"<br /><br />The challenge of designing the rabbis is that they had to make him distinct from Bugs Bunny. They rushed out the Roger Rabbit design, too many colours, triangle-shaped like a dunce hat, needed a peach impediment (lip ruffle?). Chapinesque tex Avery style of animation. JOel Silver first human actor in the whole show. Bob Hoskins did a perfect American accent. \\"There's really no reason to shoot a film in the US.\\" This was the first time to get all of the cartoons of the various studios into one film. Why is there no question mark after the title. Toon swearing was a problem for Disney. Roger has no shoulders (or nose), Jessica has no waist so that there would be no accusations that a human actor was used and then rotored out. \\"Why Don't You Do Right\\" by Peggy Lee was sung by Amy Irving. An actor who was strangeld by Darth Vader is in Roger Rabbit.oo many colours, triangle-shaped like a dunce hat, needed a peach impediment (lip ruffle?). Chapinesque tex Avery style of animation.

030758836X|1.0|I wish I could give this book no stars at all. It is vitriolic, depressing, spiteful, unbelievable, denigrating to both men and women, inaccurate regarding psychological pathology, oppressive, droningly long, monotonous, tedious, and boring. Do not read this book. It is a waste of time. No redeeming qualities at all.
1591845556|3.0|I guess this book may have been the result of Kaufman applying his skill acquisition methods to writing!<br /><br />All snark aside, this book fell short of what I expected.  The first part of the book goes over the theory of skill acquisition that he has researched.  It's very short, which is unfortunate, as he does a good job of putting things together in a nice arc.  But the section is so short that it feels like a top ten list rather than an actual fleshed out theory.<br /><br />Then the majority of the book is taken up by rather lengthy descriptions of how he went about learning a few different skills.  I found this section too focused on the particulars of each skill; and there was little to no explicit mention of how he actually applied his theory to learning new skills.  I can see how some elements were in play, but it would have been nice to see more in depth analysis of how each point on his checklists matters, rather than 20 stick figure drawings of yoga poses. It's to bad, I really wanted to like this book, and many of the skills Kaufman pursues are interests of mine, but a lot of the passages just seem to be edited versions of his personal learning journal of what yoga poses or ruby commands worked, rather than an analysis of how learning skills is itself a skill.<br /><br />In short, don't get burned like me, wait for this one to go on sale, get it at the library, or just watch his YouTube videos and read his blog.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|A cool little Johnny Depp film directed by Tim Burton, with all of the dark dramatics. Depp plays a vampire whose family has been cursed by a spurned lover (she was a witch). The story is fun, and at times funny, with a groovy setting in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are a few times when Burton misses a chance for humor, like when the vampire feasts on hippies (shouldn't he get stoned, and maybe loosen up a bit?). There's a hilarious scene of supernatural wall climbing, ornament-smashing ultra-sex (think Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone in The Professional, but with super powers). Nice appearance by Alice Cooper, singing his \\"Ballad Of Dwight Fry\\", which is the inspiration for one of the characters' back stories.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Extraordinarily plotted from a faintly ludicrous premise which the writer gives almost believable credence to.... Fast paced so a page  turner of note. A little of the Scandanavian but a world book. Highly recommended.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|With a small amount of training, I am able to save some guitar lessons that I, at my skill level need to see numerous times. it's a beautiful thing.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|this movie shows that we are all different and alike, no one person is better than another. if given a chance every one is worth it.
B003WJ81MA|5.0|There is something hypnotic about this film, despite the icky presence of Tom Cruise (a rare film where he doesn't make himself larger than life). The film is more similar to a Peter Greenaway pic than something by Ridley Scott, and it oozes atmosphere, with its foggy forests and hidden waterfalls, with maidens dancing innocently with unicorns... before they are stolen away by goblins in the employ of the Goblin Lord. The narrative is clumsy, and Tom Cruise absorbs the light (meaning the opposite of \\"he shines\\"). Okay.<br /><br />The film starts off with the demon's lament, \\"sunlight is my destroyer.\\" The film is full of forest sounds, strange rays of light, fairies, colours and shadows. Creatures run past like Alien creatures. Over-wrought soundtrack (there are two - I'd like to hear the one that's done by Tangerine Dream, rather than the full Jerry Goldsmith one). Nice horny Pan creature, Honeythorn Gump. By the end of the film we get the true entrance of the Dark Lord, which is bloody cool indeed, and the strange black cathedral, with the ghoulish wedding between woman and beast. \\"We are all animals; most are too afraid to see it.\\" Great underwater shots.

B000WQW988|5.0|This great DVD shows the original uncut recording, with all of the commercial break pauses and other random chit chat, along with the original MTV broadcast (which didn't include \\"Oh, Me\\". It also has all of the looseness (not to mention an impromptu rendition of Sweet Home Alabama) that you don't get in the superbly-edited CD recording. The MTV broadcast, for example, edits out the story of the offer of Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000 (apparently the offer was only a tenth of that, but it's always more interesting to exaggerate a story), while both the MTV broadcast and the CD edit out Kurt's mispronunciation of David Geffen as David \\"Gessen\\". It also edits out the profanity, such as \\"fart you all, this is the last song of the evening\\" before the band goes into an insanely good \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night.\\" Funny, he pretends to smash a guitar at the end of the set, before walking off. Ah yes, Kurt - in those days he walked, he talked, he smoked, he gave autographs... he loved his wife and his daughter... then he blew his brains out and selfishly deprived all of us of himself and his songs. But hey, what did he owe us? How can one person just give and give and give and give...?<br /><br />It's cool to see him so close, his glassy stare, his occasional smile, the way his jaw shifts in strange ways, how he seems to sing so effortlessly, how he hardly seems to move from his perch at the edge of his band, who sit so far behind him. Krist slack-jawes, Dave Grohl trying to be light-hearted, Pat Smear off to the side and looking a bit amused with it all... The biggest revelation of the DVD is the banter between the last two songs and a strange audience interaction when they request REM's \\"Pretty Persuasion\\" (?!?!), and one woman screams lustily \\"RAPE ME!!!\\" A shocked, yet devilish smile from Kurt here. \\"I don't think MTV will let us play that.\\"<br /><br />The DVD also has a weird \\"interviews with\\" a bunch of irrelevant people who were there or involved backstage. It's very different from the spirit of the show. There are also a few samples of the practice session, where we hear that Kurt's vocals are too low in \\"Polly\\", how his voice cracks already in \\"Plateau\\", not to mention how you get to see Curt Kirkwood singing along to his own songs (as we do in the main set). Wow.very different from the spirit of the show.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|I have read the one-star reviews with interest. Even Leonard Maltin gets it wrong, saying that it's about a sheik who wants to develop a fishing resort. Whoever wrote that didn't see the movie. None of them seems to understand that the novel and film aren't really about salmon, fishing, or the Yemen. I wonder how these reviewers feel about The Shawshank Redemption, because this movie has, thank you Lasse Hallstrom, the very same themes as Shawshank: faith, love, and hope.<br /><br />Devotees of Shawshank may feel the very same way about this movie. Yes, some elements are formulaic, but every successful drama, including Shawshank, has a first, second, and third act, and each of them in these two movies are so similar, save for Shawshank's tacked on ending, not in the book. Comic relief? Both have some of that as well. Yes, you can trace the structures back to Greece and Rome. And that's not bad. Many of those plots are still around, including this one. How can you be bored by faith, love and hope?
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Kinky Boots is a great cast recording!  This is definitely one of my new favorites.  This cast recording manages to offer different styles of music, and I find them all to be very catchy: there are fast paced songs such as \\"Everybody Say Yeah,\\" \\"Raise You Up/Just Be,\\" and \\"Step One\\", but also has slower songs like \\"Not My Father's Son\\" and \\"Hold Me In Your Heart.\\"  The best part about this cast recording is that it really captures the energy in the live theater.  I was pleasantly surprised by how they were able to keep Billy Porter's numbers such as \\"Sex Is In The Heel\\" and \\"What A Woman Wants\\" as energetic and fun as they are in the show.  Overall, this recording has great songs, and a brilliant cast to deliver them.  Billy Porter is amazing, and Stark Sands' voice is simply flawless!  I would highly recommend this cast recording to any music lover.
144072640X|5.0|World peace at last!  The governments of the world have finally come together and discovered that the underlying basis for all tension and friction between human beings is nothing more than physical appearance.  So, at the age of 16, everybody gets an operation.  Facial structure, height, and weight are all adjusted to fit everyone within the acceptable parameters.  The world has become a utopia where everything is beautiful, perfect, and conflict-free.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood has been waiting all her life to turn pretty and she assumes that her new friend, Shay, has too.  But Shay has other ideas.  Shay likes the way she looks and doesn't want to be changed.  There are rumors of a settlement called the Smoke, somewhere out in the wild where people like Shay are gathering and Shay wants to join them.  Unable to talk Tally into coming with her Shay runs off alone the week before her 16th birthday.<br /><br />Without meaning to, Shay gets Tally in trouble by running away.  The Special Circumstances agency wants Tally to follow Shay to the Smoke using Shay's hand-written clues that only Tally can decipher.  If Tally doesn't help, she doesn't turn pretty.  Tally finally agrees but when she arrives at the Smoke, her whole world begins to turn upside-down.<br /><br />The Smokies reveal to Tally the true nature of the `pretty operation.'  As it turns out they don't just change your appearance, they literally change your mind.  Aggressive tendencies are removed leaving the subject passive and compliant.  Now Tally must decide whether to activate the beacon that will lead Special Circumstances to the Smoke, or to join the Smokies in their fight to reveal the truth to everyone.<br /><br />First of all, I should tell you that I found Uglies in the teen section of the library.  I had been through most of the CD audiobooks in the adult section that looked good to me.  They still had a lot of audio books on tape, but who has a tape player these days?<br /><br />Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised with this first audiobook of the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy.  Scott Westerfeld has created a futuristic world that is both complete and believable.  Okay, the hover-cars and voice activated elevators are almost clich&eacute; but Westerfeld shows a certain amount of creativity with things like chewable toothbrush tablets and roving drum machines that incite parades and parties everywhere they go through the streets of New Prettytown.  Also, I think the social issues Westerfeld takes on here are important for young and old readers alike.  Scott Westerfeld is a good writer and he puts in plenty of action and adventure to keep the story moving.<br /><br />Carine Montbertrand is a good audiobook reader.  She's no master of voices but she does manage to create different personas for the major characters, although many of the boy characters sound similar.  All in all, I enjoyed her narration of Uglies.<br /><br />Uglies is a nice bit of science fiction.  More importantly, I think it has some important lessons about being happy with who you are and not what you look like.  Scott Westerfeld also touches briefly on the importance of preserving the environment.  Uglies is a fun audiobook and has plenty for us to learn from, whether we're young or old.pleasantly surprised with this first audiobook of the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy.

B005LAIHR2|5.0|I saw the previews for this film, and wanted to gag at the thought of Tom Cruise writhing on stage like Iggy Pop; turns out that the film is actually a lot more fun than I'd envisioned, as it goes through your typical Purple Rain sort of story, but in an LA rock setting in the late Eighties. A few genuine surprises (during the \\"I Can't Fight This Feeling\\" sequence), and some very cool rock club sequences as our heroes seriously get the lead out! The rock `n' roll weirdo scenes are pretty funny, if you think about it, and somehow the relatively sophisticated plot threads do come together fairly well in a not-necessarily-based-on-impossible-coincidences sorts of things happening. But hey, it's only rock `n' roll... and I like it!<br /><br />On the negative side, it is a bit grueling listening to Tom Cruise singing \\"Paradise City\\" and other rock classics, and the girl vocalist's helium singing can be jarring at times. Still, you have to credit the film for really embracing Eighties rock, some of which hasn't aged well (Night Ranger, Pat Benatar) and putting it right up there on the pedestal.<br /><br />Best line of the movie happens when the boy and the girl are comparing their misfortunes:<br /><br />Girl: \\"I mean, jeez - I'm a stripper.\\"<br />Boy: \\"Well... I'm in a boy band.\\"<br />Girl: \\"Okay, you win.\\"

144234430X|3.0|I'm a pretty big fan of science fiction, and I have always loved \\"what if?\\" stories: What if the South had won the Civil War, what if Hitler had never been born, things of that nature.  In 11/22/63, Stephen King explores the question \\"What if President John F Kennedy had not been assassinated.\\"  I suppose many Americans have asked themselves that question at one time or another, even those of us who were born after the event, and I'm not surprised that King chose that topic for his latest novel.  From his various published works, it's easy to see that King has always been a keen observer of the times he has lived in and he has created some immensely stirring literature based on those observations.  I'm thinking here of Hearts in Atlantis among others.<br /><br />Although time travel and what if stories are nothing new, I thought Stephen King added a few original twists to the theme.  Instead of the traveler going back to any time they choose, King's portal to the past comes out in one particular place and time; September 9, 1958.  There's nothing particularly special about that day, but it is reasonably close to some major events: about six weeks before the day of the tragedy in the Dunning family, and just five years before the Kennedy assassination.  That means Jake Epping can, shall we say, practice on the Dunning family before the main event in Dallas.  That practice run will prove to be very important as Jake learns that the past does not like to be changed.  And if worse comes to worst, he can always step back through the portal and try again, because every trip through the portal is a reset and everything goes back to normal.  Well, almost.<br /><br />I also liked King's idea of how the past harmonizes; similarities that keep cropping up no matter where Jake goes; people who look the same or have similar names, the same gun or the same car showing up, similarities in places and situations.  It happens too often to be mere coincidence, and it may be too late by the time Jake finds out that it is his very presence that's causing the echoes.<br /><br />Stephen King has often been accused of being, shall we say, a bit on the \\"wordy\\" side in his novels.  I've never had any problem with that because his wordiness always goes toward developing his characters: showing us their inner thoughts and giving detailed background information, all those things that let the reader get to know the characters intimately.  I think that's a good thing because the more you know a character, the more you will care about them and, therefore, the more you will become involved in the story.  In 11/22/63 however, I really felt that King included some passages that we could have done without, portions of the audiobook that didn't seem to add anything useful.  I liked the story and the characters, but I honestly feel that this one could have been trimmed down a little.<br /><br />In the end, it is King's mastery of suspense that drives this novel.  He knows how to keep us turning pages like none other.  No matter how Jake Epping tries to stop Lee Harvey Oswald, it still all comes down to that fateful moment at the Texas Book Depository.  There are some incredibly tense moments as the bus Jake is on crashes, then a car he \\"borrows\\" breaks down.  One thing after another as the natural past tries to assert itself and stop Jake's mission.<br /><br />Craig Wasson is a good audiobook narrator, although some of his accents were questionable.  Like most of King's novels, 11/22/63 takes place partly in Maine.  Wasson tried to do that difficult Maine accent but it came out sounding more Irish.  Wasson did, however, do a pretty fair JFK imitation, and did a convincing Walter Cronkite as well.  There was another character that sounded like a cross between Richard Nixon and James Stewart, so I'm not sure what Wasson was going for there.  Accents aside, Wasson did a good job.  He read with a little more emotion than many narrators, which is something I like to hear.  The amount of feeling in Wasson's reading is, I think, his major redeeming quality.  Even with the funny accents, I enjoyed his narration a lot.<br /><br />At the end of the audiobook, Stephen King himself reads the after word.  It's about 15 minutes long and largely uninteresting, but he does talk a little bit about some of his research for this novel: things he read and places he visited.<br /><br />11/22/63 is not King's best novel, but it's still pretty good.  It was, perhaps, not an entirely original story idea, but I think King threw in some unique twists to make the story his own.  His strong characters and attention to detail are just as present as ever.  Personally, I believe anything Stephen King writes is worth a read, or a listen.ar.

B000P0J09W|4.0|Preposterous and clinically weird film full of misfits and maladroits (and the odd hot chick), including someone wearing a Purple Rain t-shirt at the beginning (?!?!). Hardcore stuff - kids saying \\"s***\\", Michelangelo's David's penis broken off, screwball comedy, Data throwing a weird tantrum. The DVD has some special features, such as outtakes, and a documentary on the making of The Goonies, showing a freaked out Richard Donner. Cyndy Lauper's video with pro wrestlers comes up, along with Stephen Spielberg's cameo. Actors appear in the video, which has a part one and a part two, the latter of which includes Andre the Giant.

In the other reviews of this app, there has been complaints about the controls being difficult to use. As with any other app on these touchscreen devices, keep in mind where your fingers are otherwise you will probably access a menu or something else which will prove to  cause an inconvenience at the worst possible time.

1427205264|5.0|Ender's Game is told from the perspectives of several different characters.  For each perspective, a different narrator was used.  I didn't count, but there were probably at least eight different narrators for this audio book.  Unfortunately, I don't know who they were, see below.  Audible .com listed two of the narrators as Stefan Rudnicki and Harlan Ellison.  Aside from that, I recognized the dull recitation of Scott Brick.  Luckily, Brick only narrated a small portion of the audio book.  The narrators did a good job overall; I particularly enjoyed the guy who read Ender's parts, whoever that was, and the woman who read Valentine's parts.<br /><br />The 20th anniversary edition of Ender's Game has an all-new afterword delivered by author Orson Scott Card.  I listened to about five minutes of it and got bored.  Judging by how long I had to fast-forward, I'd say Card rambled on for at least half an hour, probably more.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed Ender's Game, the overall experience of this audio book was not great.  There's no announcement at the beginning of each disk, something I really dislike in an audio book.  Also, the story started right up on disk one with no introduction at all; the title was not even mentioned.  Finally, I was very disappointed to find that the names of the narrators were not given anywhere in the production.  I liked most of the narrators; it would be nice to know their names.<br /><br />I didn't like the way this audio book was put together, but I found Ender's Game to be a fascinating story.  Orson Scott Card grabbed my attention very early in the audio book and kept me hanging on right up until the end.
B00979CS50|4.0|A great new album by Neil Young, and a worthy follow-up to La Noise. The opening song, \\"Drifting Back\\", kind of goes on and on for 27 minutes, starting out with a groovy acoustic sound before clumsily galloping up into electric mid-stream, several verses widely dispersed with rambling electric jams. Even the ending is goofy and drawn out. Awesome. \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" (which also comes with an alternate mix), is funky, psychedelic and washed out with flange. Love it - short and sweet at only three minutes! The alternate mix is slightly shorter, uses a bit less flange and more echo on the vocal - choose your favorite. \\"Ramada In\\" is another one of those \\"long haul songs\\", but this one is only about 16 minutes long. More zany Crazy Horse goodness roaming along and along and along. Aces!! \\"Born In Ontario\\" is exactly the hokey thing that you'd imagine it would be, folksy and rootsy. \\"Twisted Road\\", which opens disc 2, tells groovy tales of listening to Bob Dylan, youth, discovering music at the start of a \\"twisted path\\" that leads to the present day. \\"She's Always Dancing\\" has that goofy Crazy Horse backing vocals with the wild wailing guitar. Nice. \\"For The Love Of Man\\" is a chilled out old song with a very light touch (a bit dull, actually). \\"Walk Like A Giant\\" saunters out of the gate, with whistling from Neil and the Crazy Horses, sounds exactly like something that would have come out many many years ago. Wow.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It was 1978 the last time Ozzy Osbourne got together with his band Black Sabbath to record new songs, the classic Never Say Die (much-maligned, it's still full of great songs). They used Sounds Exchange in Toronto, Canada and froze their balls off from January to May putting the album together, a period of much misery according to Ozzy's book (interestingly, Keith Richards had used the studio the year earlier to record his Toronto Tapes). At the time I was in neighbouring Mississauga, nine years old, and knew nothing about Black Sabbath. I was in grade four at school, with my favorite teacher Martyn Godfrey, and I went to piano lessons. I think that summer I might have started listening to the Beatles in 1978, but I don't think so - it might have been 1979. Can't be sure any more. Later, in 1981, I became a super-huge Ozzy Osbourne fan upon the release of \\"Diary Of A Madman\\"; \\"Speak Of The Devil\\", where Ozzy records Black Sabbath songs with his own band, was the first music item I ever bought with my own money. I remember hearing Mob Rules play on the radio in 1981 when it was released.<br /><br />A year after recording Never Say Die, Ozzy was fired from the band, and spent the next 34 years building a monstrous solo career, probably in no small part to the masterful management of his wife Sharon. Good job, girl. He has actually recorded and toured with Black Sabbath over the years, but there's been no new album with him and the band... until June 11th, 2013!<br /><br />Of course, Black Sabbath had kept going over the years with Tony Iommi and a rotating line-up of original or new members, which included a great spell with Ronnie James Dio; the last Black Sabbath album was Forbidden, released in 1995 with Tony Martin. It did not get good reviews. Since then Iommi has released two solo albums, and another album with Ronnie James Dio in 2009 that could have been called a Black Sabbath album the way Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules were, but it wasn't (the band called itself Heaven And Hell to save itself legal grief - nice move, since Heaven And Hell is also a great band name, and the relaxed legal atmosphere probably helped give rise to the current re-re-reunion and its immense productivity).<br /><br />So lucky for us - now we get this, a new Black Sabbath album, released on June 11th, 2013 and called 13 in honour of the year it was released (and maybe to piss off Anvil and Suicidal Tendencies, who have albums with the same name out this year). While critical reviews that I have seen have generally been positive, there have been some mixed reviews from fans, who have plenty to gripe about for the absence of the magical Bill Ward on skins (apparently he was falling off his drum stool - too old to play?) or Rick Rubin's production capabilities, but I have no complaints at all. It's a great album! It gives us everything we want - great riffs, great energy, great teamwork, great lyrics (nobody ever mentions the lyrics - they're superb!!), great reminders of the band's sound through its various periods over the years, and funky, fun production elements. Wow!!<br /><br />I even like the single \\"God Is Dead?\\", which has great mood, great riffs, and a wonderful stomp towards the end (of course, the solo is ultra-short - Iommi more than makes up for that on the rest of the album). And here's another thing that nobody mentions is the linkage between the recent death of Ronnie James Dio (Dio, of course, means God in many languages) and the obvious rivalry between Dio and Ozzy. Looks like Ozzy won that rivalry, and gets to shout \\"Dio Is Dead\\" night after night. A bit creepy, and I might be reading too much into this, but hey - what if?<br /><br />The songs are fantastic, and extremely varied, as we get songs akin to the band's 70s sound, 80s sound, 90s sound, and Ozzy's solo sound. \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" starts the album with a pun, as well as big slashes of doom chords, just the way the first album opened up with the song \\"Black Sabbath\\", and then gets into swing. It just goes on and on, before ending up with a positive major-chord chorus. Ultimately, it's very doom-y, with a long solo. \\"God Is Dead?\\" is well known by now - bloody good, with a cool \\"Hole In The Sky\\"-ish stomp near the middle, although it does have some cheezy moments on Ozzy's delivery (no worry, plenty of great moments too!); this the first song to refer to Satan, who is mentioned or is part of the spirit of several songs on the album (\\"Methademic\\" seems to be written from his point of view again). I believe that it was the best choice for a single, but could have been improved with a better solo (and one longer than only eight bars). \\"Loner\\" is crunchy and cool, a bit of a pop song. A lot of people I know call this their favorite song on the album, but it's probably the one I like the least, from its over-simplicity right down to the annoying drum sounds. \\"Zeitgeist\\" is the \\"Plant Caravan\\"-isch tune, right down to the bongos (looks like Rubin showed some self restraint by not putting Ozzy's vocals through the exact same effect as they did on \\"Planet Caravan\\", clearly; it's one of the only things that's different about this recent update of that song). But it's a great song nonetheless - you can never have too much of a good thing. \\"Age Of Reason\\" is a long song that kicks off with a fantastic opening riff, quickly gets into great verses, then goes through lots if huge changes; I thought at first that it sounds rather like a song from an Ozzy solo album, with Zakk Wylde-ish dive-bombing, but I do now believe it's very Sabbath-y. There's a great solo, and a wee bit of keyboards thrown in. \\"Live Forever\\" is a cool, crunchy rocker again, it could have been on the Devil You Know album the band did with Ronnie James Dio in 2009. \\"Damaged Soul\\" is a great bluesy number that gets pretty heavy. A great bluesy stomp that has a cool harmonica solo. As such, it's the key song on the album for emulating the dynamics of the first album. Great solo too - it just goes on and on! \\"Dear Father\\" is a scary song about child abuse, also more like an Ozzy solo song. It has a crunchy riff and a poppy solo. At one point it picks up into a very cool stomp and charges along. Great! It closes abruptly with the thunder and rain sounds that you'd hear on the first album, probably indicating the completion of a cycle of Black Sabbath. It may also indicate that there will be no follow-up to 13 - that's it from Black Sabbath, thank you very much, and that first song really was the beginning of the end of the band. Eight songs, just like they have on most of their albums.<br /><br />There are three \\"bonus songs\\" on the second disc that's included in the deluxe edition; bonus songs are great, but I'm not sure why they needed a second disc - there are only 69 minutes of music combined between the two discs, it would have all fit onto one with five minutes to spare. As such, all of the bonus songs are good, and should probably have been better on the album in the place of weaker songs like \\"Loner\\" and \\"Dear Father\\". They are also pretty short - in the official eight album songs, half of them are over seven minutes long, but the three bonus tracks are only five minutes long or less (\\"Peace Of Mind\\" is only 3:41, nearly as short and tight as \\"Paranoid\\", ha ha). \\"Methademic\\" starts with cool acoustic guitar before breaking into that unstoppable riff and some songwriting and lyrics (great Ozzy snicker here). Of course, the anti-drug lyrics are a bit hypocritical, but the song still makes a nice partner song to the anti-heroin \\"Hand Of Doom\\"). Later, he reveals that he's singing the song from Satan's point of view by snickering again and saying \\"Hell is where you're going... heh heh heh, I'll see you there\\"). Cool psychedelic sound effects at the end, man. \\"Peace Of Mind\\" is a cool mid-tempo rocker full of crunchy guitars that sounds a bit like \\"Live Forever\\". \\"Pariah\\" has one of the coolest opening riffs of any song on the album- actually, it's a double opening with a very nice mellow electric start-up, before breaking out into a killer riff. The song has a very tender, beautiful solo. Great closer to the set - better closer than \\"Dear Father\\", actually... which proves that you need to get the \\"Deluxe edition\\" and not the regular release (as an added feature you'll also have the satisfaction of knowing that you're getting what the vinyl snobs are missing out on, heh heh).<br /><br />Great album - get it if you haven't already!solo too - it just goes on and on! \\"Dear Father\\" is a scary song about child abuse, also more like an Ozzy solo song.

Great reunion between Tuco and his brother.<br /><br />Tuco and Angel Eyes are in the film quite a lot, it's hardly a film that features much of its star, The Man With No Name, despite already being the third film in the series. But apparently Eastwood had already tired of working with Leone because of his dictatorial methods and his gluttonous character - it was the last time they worked together.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Although he weather program is very accurate and helpful, why can't the programers give us more widget options regarding color and size white backrounds for me ar very annoying, especially at night when i am in my truck.  So hy not at least give us a few different color options that will accomadate all of us not just the programmers...after alll i did pay for this. Pleasenconsider this. Thank you
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is such a fine writer whose books grip you from the first page and never lets go.  A great read.I thought his first two books were wonderful so I was not surprised that his latest was just as good.  I look forward to a future book by this author.[[ASIN:B009XIXVU6 And the Mountains Echoed: A Novel]]
B009O2XY12|2.0|I tried this game because I used to love Poppit on my PC, and this was the closest I could find in the Kindle marketplace.  Because I had expected something like Poppit, I was disappointed.  I am 70, so there was nothing challenging for me.  My husband likes it much better than I do, but he hasn't played with as many computer games as I have, so it's all a newer experience for him.
1401223176|3.0|Not a flop, but also not really a great book; of course, the art by Jim Lee is stunning (the sculpted drawings simply call out to be touched and fondled; the influence of artists like Todd McFarlane, John Byrne and John Romita Jr is clear). Writer Jeph Loeb is clearly intent to produce a masterpiece, so he calls up every single major Batman foe and gets them into the picture. Batman confronts the Killer Croc, Two Face (handsome after an extensive bout of plastic surgery). Poison Ivy, a bewitched Superman (yes - like The Dark Knight Returns, Batman gets to beat the snot out of Superdude), the Riddler, the Joker, Scarecrow, Lady Siva, Clayface, Harley Quinn and maybe a few more - oh yeah, Ra's Al Ghul too. But, meanwhile, there's a hidden plotter manipulating everybody, and Batman gets to figure out who it is... sort of. And, of course, there are plenty of ghostly flashback scenes to make everything in the past very alive and relevant. Nicy kryptonite ring. Interestingly, all of the Robins also make an appearance - Dick Grayson (as Nightwing), the undead Jason Todd, and the mini Tim Drake). And, of course, there are also three guys wrapped up in Hush bandages. Outrageous!<br /><br />In one of the sillier scenes, he hijacks Thalia's private jet mid-air in order to provoke her estranged father out of hiding (did I mention that she now runs Lexcorp, which Lex Luthor has had put in trust while he serves his term as President of the United states. Ooooo-kay!! Did I also mention that he's now in love with Catwoman?<br /><br />The most infuriating element is the resurgence of Thomas Eliot, a childhood friend we've never heard about before, who uses the word \\"hush\\" in an early scene... c'mon, how can he not be the character Hush?!?!?!? Loeb nearly throws us off the trail once, but eventually it all comes together - and how many times does he need to talk about it being a game before we clue in to the flashback scenes of Bruce and Tommy playing chess. Oh yeah... let's not just observe a detective in action, but maybe we can also be a bit of a detective ourselves. The writing is very show-offy and grandstand-ish, and in the end, even with the story concluded, Loeb still can't resist giving it another layer, so... the Riddler did it. Wow... my mind is blown.observe a detective in action, but maybe we can also be a bit of a detective ourselves.

B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|An interesting and exciting read.  There are bad guys and good guys a plenty.  The premise is, there are worlds existing all around us and they can be influenced by people and objects from all worlds.  Only a chosen few people can travel to these worlds and use the objects.  The story is primarily about only 3 of the worlds in this book, There are a few main characters that I'm sure will be back in the sequels.  .
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Bradley Cooper and Sarah Lawrence were awesome in this movie about family, dysfunction, and the hard knocks we know life can throw our way. I waited a long time to see it but it was totally worth the wait.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Does anybody know how to get the new upgrade? I have a Kindle fire and it sucks that the kindle fire doesn't get upgrades as fast.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Watched Mars Attacks from a scratched-up library DVD. Sadly, the second half was nearly un-viewable since it skipped through nearly the entire movie. Big bummer, man. Some problems with pacing - for the first 30 minutes of so, we observe everyone on earth anticipating that the Martians are friendly, that they won't attack. We know better, of course, which makes that whole section a bit pointless. Even after the first attack there are some laughs that the slaughter was based on some sort of \\"cultural misunderstanding\\". The evil-ness of the Martians is unsubtle and one-dimensional. They are, simply, evil. Independence Day plays this seriously, but I prefer this one. Ha ha... Martians.<br /><br />Lots of great lines: like the translator that comes up with \\"For dark is the suede taht mows a harvest.\\" Or the kid when he talks to his grandmother: \\"I bet people were pretty scared when they invented the train.\\" \\"I'm not that old.\\" Grandma calls all her grandkids Thomas. First question from a reporter in the press conference: \\"Do the martians have two sexes like we do?\\" Boxing match: The Quaker in Jamaica. Danny DeVito's appeal to the pitiless Martian: \\"I'm a lawyer. When you take over the Earth you're going to need lawyers.\\" \\"Liberals, intellectuals, peacemongers, idiots!\\" Each dummy gets the end they deserve, but Jack Black (\\"I surrender!\\") and Michael J Fox get it first. Dross from the president: \\"We will soon come out with a very real outcome.\\" That whole sentence is just so wrong!!
B00C061HZY|5.0|Was so ecstatic when the new DP album was releasing.  Not gonna lie I was expecting a few good tracks including Get Lucky but spent a whole day playing it over and over!  This is the 2nd record album I've bought and it was well spent.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This was a good story though it did seem to drag in some places. Glad to see a woman heroine at the helm, and glad to know there are lots of brave soldiers still out there willing to sacrifice all for their beliefs.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this app., my son n` law recommended it. My entire family now has the Kindle Fire and all use this app. I like that it shows how much battery life remains for reading, gaming, surfing the web or whatever else you plan to use.
B00448SE4S|4.0|Nice/stupid little movie, significant mainly because it's a Hollywood movie filmed in Toronto that describes itself as taking place in... Toronto? Wow... when has that ever happened before?!?!? Besides showing the Toronto skyline and referencing Toronto (and describing people as Canadian or American), it's funny/awesome to note that one of the concerts in the film takes place at Lee's Palace!! There's reference to a film set, \\"they make movies in Toronto?!?\\" It's also nice to see Pizza Pizza joints in the film. Funny dialogue:<br /><br />\\"I've never even kissed a boy.\\"<br />\\"Me neither.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm a big fan.\\"<br />\\"Ha ha - why wouldn't you be?\\"<br /><br />\\"All of our shows are secret shows.\\"<br /><br />\\"You cocky cock - you will pay for your crimes against humanity!\\"<br /><br />\\"What's the \\"L\\" word?\\"<br />\\"Lesbian?\\"<br />\\"The other \\"L\\" word?\\"<br />\\"Lesbians?\\"<br />\\"No, it's \\"love\\", you dimwit.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm in lesbians with you.\\"<br /><br />Good music, nice band performances and music dynamic. Cool names, like Knives Chao. Bad plot, stupid action scenes, retarded video game element to the film, and the swift editing grates a bit with its insipid cleverness. Oh well. Watching the extras, you get 22 minutes of alternate scenes, including an ending where he doesn't get the girls. Oh well. At least Ramona is very cool, even if Scott isn't.
B005GRTNXC|5.0|I'm not even sure why this isn't available in the US-enough said.  Leona Lewis has great vocals and mixing them up in these new electronic sounds compliments them really well.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|The CD's in this collection come in miniature versions of the original LP album covers including Joni's artwork, lyrics and album credits.  It really takes me back to see the packaging I was so familiar with when I had the LP version of these classic albums.  I have to admit some of the text is hard to read for this 50-something guy but it's such a cool concept.  They take up a lot less space than the same number of CD's stored in jewel cases.  I've pretty much imported my music collection into digital format and use Amazon's Cloud Player to access them.  There are a few artists (like Joni) that I have a hard time letting go of the physical CD's.
B007L6VR12|4.0|... there were 666 five star reviews and I didn't want to misalign the stars.<br /><br />This is my review:<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom is another wonderful Wes Anderson film that, like so many of his other films, contains a few wonderful elements:<br /><br />- geeky kids<br />- a cutaway of the characters' living environment<br />- a wimpy fight sequence near the end<br />- some sort of natural calamity<br /><br />Not so sure about the last one, but all of these happen in Moonrise Kingdom, which does its best to re-create Waris Hussein's 1971 puppy love comedy Melody (also known as Sealed With A Loving Kiss), but with his inimical ironic style. Set in rural America in the 1960s, it also has a soundtrack of quirky little musical gems, such as April March's \\"Les Temps De L'amour\\", and Benjamin Britten's famous \\" The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (Introduction/Theme; Fugue)\\", as directed by Leonard Bernstein. A strange young orphan and an odd girl run away from home, get married, and build up a posse of other strange youths, most of them fellow boy scouts, and a sympathetic police captain played by Bruce Willis (?!?!). Harvey Keitel makes a cameo appearance as a grizzled old Scout master, and there's all sorts of bizarre Scout politics involved (John Cusack is a scout leader who, initially disgraced when he loses his squad, who manages to redeem himself). Tilda Swinton is also resplendent as a very serous social worker. A really wonderful film.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This is a show which has fun at the viewers expense and that's a very good thing.  Its rare that you can find a sci-fi show that doesn't take its premise or itself so seriously yet still have interesting plots and characters (kinda like Star Trek or the original 3 Star Wars).  The shows are low tech yet deal with futuristic problems/events/story lines.<br /><br />I'm only halfway through Season 1 but its been a blast!  Sit back relax and laugh/enjoy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played. I hope there is more to come. I couldn't stop playing.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|very good book, kept me reading till I finished it. couldn't put it down. Can't say anything more about the book or it will give the plot away.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|My daughter loves all Dr. Panda and was thrilled to see this. Unfortunately like several others, my Motorola Android did not work but it also did not open on the Kindle Fire after being downloaded to phone.  It either freezes or takes you back to Amazon app screen.  I usually have great things to say about Dr. Panda but there is a glitch so for us this is a real dud.
0760703329|5.0|You don't have to say much about Shakespeare, but the book was done beautifully  Great quality on cover and pages.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters got bad reviews but it IS without a doubt one of the best cult classic movies ever made.<br />The movie is very Evil Dead 2 & 3 and Jeremy Renner IS a young Bruce Campbell!<br />The story is great, the production is great, the visual effects are flawless, it is funny and gory.<br />Zoe Bell (the witch with the ram horns on her shoulders) is absolutely incredible during the movies first real fight scene.<br />Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner compliment each other very well as siblings, which really provides a great deal of depth to the story.<br />Famke Janssen and everyone in the supporting cast fill their roles perfectly, I mean I could go on and on but what's the point?<br />You either get this genre or you don't... my only complaint is that the unrated version is ONLY on the Bluray version. :(
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the the first 98% of this book. Great twists and turns. However, I found the ending to be a disappointment. Kind of anticlimactic.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book after watching the movie. It is certainly much better as it provides insight about what happens in the mind of the main character.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|I loved the season. I was a little scared about them bringing in new people, but they did it just fine. Plus, the new cast are starting to grow on me! Soooo ready for season 5!
0545265355|4.0|Im not a big reader at all, but everyonce in a while one will catch my eye and this trilogy goes above and beyond. A must read.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|LOVE this device ... but I'm arguably a 'techie' who doesn't mind rebooting things, and fiddling with settings occasionally on my devices and even I get annoyed at constantly having to 'reboot' the app on my iphone or iPad to connect - I also think the device 'hogs' IP addresses of other devices on the network somehow occasionally and requires rebooting the wifi and router ... when it works, it's definitely a 5 star device ... when it doesn't, your annoyance factor rises quickly to 10+<br /><br />I travel a lot and LOVE being able to check in on my little guy over 3g ... it's still worth the money despite the constant crashing / buggy app .... in my opinion
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|It was okay to watch, but not something on my see again list.<br />I would rate many other baseball movies higher.
1444710338|5.0|I was 69 years of age. My metabolism was sluggish to say the least. No diet seemed to work for me. I just did not lose weight on WW or any other diet I tried. I had spent a small fortune at WW to no avail. I heard about the Dukan diet on the news about the time of the royal wedding. Bought the book and began yet another diet! Well, let me tell you, it was as if someone pulled my \\"fat plug\\" because the weight started coming off right away. I experienced no plateaus. Within 6 months I had lost 50 pounds and went from a size 16 to a 6 or sometimes a 4. It has been two years and I am still maintaining the weight loss even though all types of foods have been brought back into my meals. My husband says that I \\"reinvented\\" myself. He feels like he is married to a different woman. The diet is simple and effective.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool,but when are they going to add enderman,villages,and the PC mobs and the enderdragon!!!!!Can't wait for the next update!!!:D
034580404X|5.0|love this trilogy. delivered fast, nothing bad to say, i would rather have hard cover but those are more expensive. for this price, you get all three books. only books ive ever read that kept my full attention.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great app for any age...educational and fun. Graphics are really fantastic with super relaxing background music. Game progress can take a little while if you don't want to pay for upgrades or such...
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked this book, though it wasn't that good like the Gone Girl but it is okay! I was able to finish.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Some mindless fun. Should have some water sections would be fun.  I just start game so I have not gotten very far.
0142421715|3.0|This volume is a much better product than the first book (which was almost falling apart) - better made and better cover graphics.  However, it's the story that counts!  The saga continues in this book with our heroine traveling from home and learning more about the possibilities of like without the strict guidlines of the society.  The book is definitely suited to middle school/junior high age kids.  The story does hold your interest, but lacks the page-turning drama of the Hunger Games series.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This game is so overrated so that's why I am downgrading it. All my friends are like \\"chord\\" you have to play this so I did for a little while and I was like okay this is fun and new and then I started to realize how ridiculously repetitive this game is. I mean I know my 3 star rating won't do a thing to its current rating because a billion people already have rated it higher than that but if you manage to find my review take this into account. Is this game really worth playing for an hour so you can get the Motorcycle? Or the Monster Truck If your stupid then the answer is no.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked the first 2 ones better, I was expecting something else with the last book, it seemed to me that the author was trying to finish the book fast so she ran out of ideas. I really loved the first ant the second one but this I have to say that could be better.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. It's great that you can rescue or purchase the animals. I love the game in general!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this wonderful book down. I would really recommend people reading this book!!! Best reading book I have reading.
B009KPCG6M|5.0|Phildel has a voice that will haunt your soul and leave you craving more.  She brings to life a passion for music and a raw realness that others lack.  You will have instant favourites, and some that grow on you.  Not a single wasted track, they are all wonderful.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My first copy mysteriously disappeared! This is a terrific replacement copy. Slightly used (as good as new) and 1/2 the price. Can't go wrong with that! (It also arrived very quickly after placing the order.)
B00A7KKPDK|1.0|i was hoping this would be about her life, growing up etc. instead it is just a book with random ideas and thoughts. i did not like this at all.
B003UYUR0G|4.0|This film should have done better in its initial release. Falls into the John Carter, After Earth, Airbender category: bad box office, (much) better than expected!
B008J05EL8|1.0|Bought this thinking it would give me more access and control while using the teachers presentations in class.  It doesn't.  In fact it doesnt do much of anything.  Not sure who would need what this crummy program does or why it would automatically offer it to me on log in.  It's a rip off.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|My original copy went missing after the grandkids visited. Ordered this replacement. Lo and behold the original copy was in the bookshelf right where it ought to have been but wasn't!
B005HSL626|5.0|Really fun and great for just passing time.  This game sort of exercises the &#34;hand, eye thing&#34;. Kids would love it.
1601251505|5.0|I've been playing D&D since the original red box. I've bought every edition ever published. By the time 3.5 came out I was highly irritated by WoTC's obvious money grabs. When 4.0 came out, I resisted buying it, but the completist geek in me forced me to get it. But I haven't read it: It sits on the shelf gathering dust in an act of geeky defiance. I liked 3.5 just fine and didn't need yet another edition. The problem is that availability of new material for 3.5 is already dwindling fast and will be all but non-existent soon, as 4.0 steamrolls ahead. But I know that if I get any material for 4.0, it will be quickly obsolesced by &#34;Next&#34;. And then will come &#34;After&#34; or some other such drivel.<br /><br />Enter Pathfinder: Fully compatible with all my 3.5 material, and with HUGE amounts of community contributions, and with a commitment by Paizo to not obsolesce the Core Rulebook, my woes have ended. They have taken the Open Gaming License material and streamlined it and created a publishing model for it that guarantees that this will be the edition to have for years to come. Great, great, great stuff!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy it very much.  It is not a speed race and you can just enjoy the game like if you were playing with real cards without having to pick them all back up.
193700788X|5.0|I thought it was really good and I loved the ending. I can't understand the negative criticism. It was a quick read for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is wonderful. I play it all the time. The only thing I would do to make itbbetter is by asking gamers their city name and have tours to their city. For example,I am from St. Louis,Missouri. I would be delighted if it was a tour in my city. You know what I mean? Other than that the game is so fun to play. Thank you for taking the time to read my feedback.
B003B02PFO|4.0|Good humor, Good observations of all kinds of folks, a bit streched out in part, but a fun read from the start.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book was awesome. It rocked. I loved the book. I reread it all the time. It deserves five stars.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Reading this again brings such fond memories of when I was a little girl.  I read this book several times before I was 10 March time it brought me stop much joy. Sometimes as adults we forget to run back to those care free times and just let our minds and imaginations enjoy life.
B007WOFXAO|4.0|This is a nice collection. It is probably worth the money and the music itself is pure gold.  I owned the vinyl and some greatest hits CDs, so this was very tempting - but I listened side-by-side with the remastered greatest hits CD I purchased (blue cover.. The Complete Greatest Hits), and this is inferior sound on most tracks. Sister Golden Hair is playing right now and this set does not have the clarity as others and the difference does not manifest as just lower level/amplitude/volume. Too bad - it could have been so much better. The remastered History: America's Greatest Hits has even better clarity on some songs.. e.g. Horse with no Name - the guitar on this one sounds like a real acoustic steel 6-string instead of a muffled studio mix, but does differ from the original intent. On the other hand, Ventura Highway on that (History) collection sounds awful.  It is pretty surprising that there are such severe differences in the production of the same songs across these original albums and the greatest hits albums - some good, some bad, but overall the clarity of this set would be improved with remastering (which is probably in the works).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very enticing! At first you are put off by this man not understanding the deep pain he harbors. After you understand why he is the way he is, you fall madly and deeply in love wanting him to feel the love as he should! This trilogy is one I could not put down until all were read as quickly as I began! EL James, I love your mind and your words! Please keep making me fall in love with your characters!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The book is a well done rendition of James Bond, but this time as Ian Fleming.  There are some movie plots and twists that say \\"James Bond\\" but the book is detailed and moves along, like any James Bond movie.  So in saying that it's worth the read and time it takes to finish this piece.  Great work!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very very fun, I like that it shows the actual characters from the movie. Also the animals look just like those in all movies. I also love the mini game kung fu scrat, it is hilarious. Great app you should go and get it, fun for all ages.
B00C2IPB66|1.0|I would put zero stars for this Blu-ray transfer but unfortunately can't......I guess we will have to wait for 4K version. This is sad.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|This movie has way to many product advertisement involved. The story is not connected very well. I would recommend that you watch it only if you have to much time
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like to play against competition. I like the challenges it put before you. great game and awesome to defeat the evil people.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is basically a game like temple run or subway surfers but better. How? Why? You may be wondering... IT HAS PENGUINS!! Who doesn't like penguins! Not liking penguins is like, not liking snow cones, or flowers, etc... But heres what I like:<br /><br />&bull;First of all, if you love penguins, you'll love this game! Its all penguins, and the coins are fish! There are lots of penguins to unlock that are super cute!<br /><br />&bull;Secondly, in the game, the obstacles are creative. Squid, crates, icicles, and even TNT!<br /><br />&bull;Thirdly, like in Subway Surfers, you run from the cops. Same in Temple Run, you run from monkey creatures. But in this, you don't run from anything, you run FOR something. I like the little twist.<br /><br />&bull;Finally, when you &quot;die&quot;, it goes all slow-motion as you watch the penguin fall. I think that's pretty cool, coming from a person who loves slow-mo.<br /><br />In every game, there are flaws. But I'm not critizising. I'm just saying what could be better.<br /><br />&bull; Control. Sometimes it's a bit hard to control my penguin. Then I die. But then again, I suck at games.<br /><br />&bull; Main Screen. I would like something more to it. I LOVE the main screen for Subway Surfers. It should be more like that. But different. Sorry if I sound confusing...<br /><br />&bull; Not enough adorable penguins. I want more... They're all so cute!!! :)<br /><br />All in all, it's an AWESOME GAME! Not as awesome as the Hunger Games series which I have read a million times, ( I know, I'm a nerd) but still pretty awesome.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Challenging and entertaining. Great for kids to keep them focus and help with attention span. Very relaxing and good travel mate.
0575024119|5.0|In these novels, Du Maurier explores the issue of what happens to a gentler personality when s/he encounters a very strong, confident personality. Sometimes the strong person is a woman; at other times he is a man. The bruising, crushing and even terrifying effect of that stronger personality can be overwhelming. In \\"Rebecca\\" the strong person almost destroys others. However in \\"Jamaica Inn\\", the author splits the response. One woman, Patience, is completely crushed but the main character is more feisty and meets the difficulties head on, as symbolized by her ability to move around the marshy lands without falling into bogs and dying.<br /><br />In \\"Frenchman's Creek\\", Du Maurier imagines a woman so strong that she enjoys sharing time with the powerful, careless, dangerous character. She revels in the danger instead of being overcome by the anxiety of the characters in \\"Rebecca\\" and \\"My Cousin Rachel.\\"<br /><br />I think that \\"Rebecca\\" is the best description of someone continually having anxiety attacks that I have ever seen. The main character's mind continually roves into the future, imagining various worrying scenarios. Sometimes she revisits them and imagines them going better. Then she actually has to live through the events having already mentally envisioned them. It is so cleverly done and give so much insight into the anxious person's mind.<br /><br />Du Maurier is a superb writer who never runs out of original ideas to work with.
1469259192|4.0|I listen to this story over the past few days as I drive my 40+ minute commute. The reader is great, he really puts me in the scene and with his consistent voice changes it's easy to follow, and believable. His Southern accent (I live in Atlanta) is a bit off, and it's tough for a guy to pull off a female voice, especially a Southern one. That's the weakest part of the reading, but it would be a challenge for any guy. But I will say this, I pull into my driveway some days and just still sit there listening, and that's in part due to the quality of the reading.<br /><br />With over 1,000 reviews, I don't have much to add about the story and the original author's writing. It fits with what I like. I really love the opening gambit, and it keeps you guessing for a while, and that's good. The violence in a few scenes is a bit over the top, compared to the series I just read (Ian Fleming's James Bond) but modern writing is more gritty so you should expect it. He gets the details of Atlanta, and the South, wrong in some spots, but it's not fatal. He misses some of the color that makes the South unique, too. In September, college football would be a big topic; I don't think it's mentioned once. I don't think a day goes by down here between August and December that I don't catch a conversation about Bull Dogs, Yellow Jackets, the Tide, or Gators.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Great story but contains gruesome violence. Author has inserted new age ideas about religion and gives the impression that the church of England in the 1300's depicts true Christianity. On the other hand, the story line confirms that power corrupts and big government seldom works for the good of the people.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I really like this game, or as much of it as I could play without going into the poor house. The graphics are great. The planning of the park, finding DNA, just fun. However, in order to get about half of the dinosaurs and other stuff for the park you create, you have to buy game dollars, which could get expensive if you really want to go that route. I didn't want to do that, so I decided to build the best park I could without investing money to buy game dollars. I think it turned out pretty good. Of course I couldn't do much with the underwater park because there is no way to earn enough money in the game to get the DNA to create the aquatic park and creatures.<br /><br />So I just worked on the above ground park, after the initial creation of the underwater park. I got one creature and a building, but the next DNA I collected the game wanted 15,000.00 to sequence the DNA, and you have to pay that about a dozen time, with no guarantee you won't get an error and lose that money. Basically, the underwater park requires you buy those game dollars. There is no way to earn an adequate amount of dollars within the game.<br /><br />Personally, I don't like it when a game is limited because the maker wants to get SUPER-paid for the game. I would rather pay a reasonable amount for the game and be able to play all parts without limitations. If this trend in games continues, I won't be buying the apps or playing the games. I just don't think it is reasonable to pay a hundred dollars to buy game dollars in order to get more out of the game.<br /><br />However, if you can live with the limitations, I find the game to be worth playing, and very enjoyable.

1623420148|5.0|OMG this sexy book had me laughing out loud, seriously hot and bothered, dreamy eyed, and ten thousand percent in love with Drew and Kate. So good in so many ways, I simply couldn't rest until I finished it. Brilliantly written, cleverly designed, and witty as all get out.  Getting inside bad boy Drew's head, and watching him transform into a blubbering, caring, love sick, romantic sweetheart was just AWESOME!!!! I'm the kind of girl that finishes a book and downloads the next the very same day, but my heart just wouldn't let these guys go. I wasn't ready. I'm still not. I think I can even convince my book club gal pals who only stick to boring non-fiction a try at this. Hell, even a NILF would love this!!!!!!!  Emma Chase, you are a huge breath of fresh air. I cannot wait to see what you brew up next!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series brings out all kinds of emotions in the viewer.  The pace of the story lines and the story lines themselves are so interesting.  The production quality of the series is impeccable.  If you are at all interested in English history and lives of the gentry, this would be an excellent addition to your video library.  I never get tired of watching it!
B001P5HI4A|3.0|but I can't.<br /><br />Streisand's directorial debut is certainly a debut worth paying attention to.  It's really impressive.  The angles, lights, shadows are wondrous.  So, too, are some of the performances.<br /><br />In this film, her voice has never sounded better.  It can only be compared with \\"The Broadway Album\\" (easily her finest recording).<br /><br />But Streisand can not play a young man.  He looks like Barbra Streisand.  I appreciate the desire and drive that was there for her to make this film, but the boy looks like Barbra Streisand.  Well, anyway, so that's that.<br /><br />Also, most of the songs, even though her voice saves the day, kind of all sound the same.  My favorite has always been \\"Will Someone Ever Look At Me That Way\\".  The finale, \\"A Piece of Sky\\" is brilliantly sung.  Admit it: she's the top.<br /><br />But her boy looks like Barbra Streisand.<br /><br />But oh would I love to have dinner with her.

What you do to make it like I tunes is you search a song that you like and press and hold on the one you want (make sure to get the audio and not the video because there will most likely be an intro) and press download as mp3 and let it download and there we go you got I tunes music without spending so much money on a bunch of songs you can get for free!!!!

I think the perspectives on slavery and its abolition were spot on, skewed neither to the right or the left - just true to the historical accounts as I understand them.  Spielberg did a great job in cobbling together  a believable and compelling historical story based on facts, morality, and great ideas of a great man.  Hats off!

B0079IEPHA|5.0|Absolutely love this TV series! It is seriously way too under the radar! Everyone does such a great acting job, the characters are so believable and intriguing. Such a brilliantly made and witty show! I catch more great things, the more I watch the episodes! Gabriel Macht and Patrick J Adams are such incredibly great actors and grossly under-utilized in Hollywood!  This show should be on prime-time so more people would see it and fall in love with it like me! Season 2 is just as great as season1!!! Highly recommend this if you are looking for a smart, witty, fun and brilliantly made TV series!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is really good. I love the animals and the dinosaurs are really cool. you should get this game.

B001E9641K|5.0|Each of the Ticket to Ride games has its own individual quirks, but the general idea is always the same. If you've played one, you've basically played them all. That being said, it's nice to have a game made for two or three people when that's how many you have playing. In particular, with three people, you can double up on segments, which can make things less frustrating for some players.

0316223239|1.0|Having just finished this book (audio version), I have to give it one star to counterbalance the ridiculous number of four and five star reviews. Is this book terrible? No. Is it really worth your time? Also, no.<br /><br />Jack, the book's narrator, really does get on your nerves. Although I fell asleep for most of the last 10 or 15 minutes of the book, I didn't even care enough to go back and re-listen to it. **Spoilers follow.** The first part of the book was somewhat thought provoking. The \\"escape\\" was silly and preposterous. Life after the room was tedious and annoying. I didn't feel much for these characters. And the spoken voices on the audio book were miscast.
1781162646|5.0|This book has it all!<br />Amazing characters<br />Emotion<br />Real life situations<br />This book will leave you with that feeling that something is missing until you pick this book up again and get lost in Joyland.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great graphics plus interesting tower def game... more fast paced compare  to the other gameloft games.. prices received really helpful
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a lot like temple run but it has a little more content like a lot more characters and hover boards (boards that prevent crashing for thirty seconds). On the there's also different locations at different times. This only changes the theme nothing else it really fun I play it more than most of my other games.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This film is a stunning achievement in all respects.  Everything... from the acting, to directing, production, soundtrack, is as brilliant as it could possibly be.  This film does the book justice, which is a very rare accomplishment for any film, let alone this complex and amazing novel.  And while you may need to watch it a few times to understand all of the connections, you will be inspired to do so... the same is true with the book.

B0064NTZKI|3.0|it is a bit boring with all the reverence payed to him by his actors. This is the sort of thing that one sees as the 'extra' on a dvd release<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because the clips of his childhood/Brooklyn and his own contributions are very interesting from a biographical perspective. The latter seem genuinely humble and if they are it seems he is the only one who has an objective opinion on his art and filmaking

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've been creating a custom group of white noise loops every night.  My plan is to have a unique group every night.  Some of the loops are obvious loops, like one of the camp fire loops, and some have annoying sounds, but most are pleasent and seemingly random or at least nice and long loops.  There's also a good number of loops.  So far, my favorite loops are the water loops like the ocean and the cave water drops.<br /><br />If you are considering getting this app, I think you should.  I didn't pay anything for it as it was a FAOTD, but after trying it out, I'd have paid 5 or so dollars for it.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|First off, I will not pass myself off as someone who has read a million biographies of Lincoln. This was a random purchase and I even for its length, I must say the ability of Doris Goodwin to craft and tell a story is excellent. This is not an in-depth Biography of Lincoln at all. In fact, it might do you some good to skim a little bit of information about his upbringing to get yourself into the right frame of mind before reading this. The book admittedly starts off a little slow as Goodwin sheds light on the beginnings of Lincoln and his future rivals: primarily Seward, Chase and Bates. As you read on, the individuals tales are woven together to highlight the few opportunities where their paths crossed prior to the 1860 Republican Convention, where eventually an enmity ensues. Lincoln, against the advice of many, brings the losing rivals into his cabinet, and this is where the story really takes off at full speed and captivated me, until the point where I was reading late into the night, truly immersed into the images of the United States during the Civil War. Goodwin's goal is the illustrate the ability of Lincoln to remain calm and assuage the ego's of his cabinet members, who sometimes go over his head, threaten to resign when they feel insulted, and fight among each other. Not only that, but we get insight into the problems face with his other rivals, such as General McClellan, who openly insults Lincoln and believes himself to be the savior of the nation, besides Congressmen, warring political factions, power-brokers and many others. In the fact of it, he manages to stand solid and find the middle ground, saving both his Presidency, his administration and the nation in the process. Goodwin still presents a honest perspective into the many missteps Lincoln took as commander of the union forces, which does the job of demonstrating that he was human after all, despite probably being one of the world's greatest leaders. If you are going to invest your time in this book (Approximately 750 pages of true reading material), I assume you have a love for history or Lincoln or both. Aside from the introductions portion, this book is actually quite an action-packed read and yet barely covers the immense historical significance of the period - as for myself, it has sparked an interest in the period.s book (Approximately 750 pages of true reading material), I assume you have a love for history or Lincoln or both.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary really backs up his data with various studies, so if you want to google them you will be able to.  I felt that he really explained ALL about Fat and how the present information is WRONG.  I finally don't feel like a failure in trying to get my HDL up and my LDL down.  IT WORKS!!!
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|As far reaching as his previous work. The humanity explored and revealed by the end of this novel more than makes up for the somewhat slow development earlier on. Also the first modern sci-Fi novel I've read with primarily African characters.

0385523912|5.0|An amazing journey into the lives of oppressed North Koreans during the famine of the 1990s.  I'm recommending it to everyone.  Halfway through it I was reminded of John Jersey's Hiroshima in the way both authors weave engrossing, intimate stories about the lives of a few people among millions caught in the vice grip of a situation they couldn't control.  I learned so much about that period in North and South Korea's history.  And the parallel to what could be in the world's future as we hear warnings of projected water and food shortages did not go unnoticed.

B008C0C1Y8|4.0|For a high production value, it nails a lot of aspects of the series: Blade Runner-style mega-city, impractical uniforms, gritty urban violence and decay, the wasteland of the Cursed Earth and the weapons and vehicles (including flying cars).<br /><br />But even for all that, there are problems: one character who absolutely should be played by Stallone is not, an obvious clue in a major event taking place is ignored when everyone should know about it, and a few other things.<br /><br />Since this is an adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics made by 2000 AD, I'll list some of this film's huge cardinal sins:<br /><br />1) Dredd's face is shown --- In the comics, he is never revealed. Since 1977, his face has been masked or in shadow, and while we can approximate what he looks like, the exact image is a mystery<br />2) Romance ---- Judges like Dredd are absolutely forbidden to have relationships, with anyone, or they hand in their badge, but this film brings it in anyway<br />3) The uniforms --- While mostly gotten right, the film has a harness instead of the gold chain connected to a large badge for the standard uniform, for no clear reason<br />4) Rico --- As noted above, he should look like Dredd, since they're clones, but while Armand Assante does a great job at acting, the crew dropped the ball on having Stallone double himself<br />5) Fergee --- In the comics a big bruiser with a slight learning curve, but here via Rob Schneider a comic relief hacker<br />6) Professor Dredd --- Dredd is a street Judge, and while he was offered the Chief Judgeship, he refused, so why this film has him teaching cadets at the Academy is baffling (and they put him in uniform, and show his face)<br />7) Dredd the Comedian --- In the comics, he's pretty much always stone-faced, but here he has a full range of emotions<br /><br />The film is fun enough and watchable (plot's certainly not lacking, and the violence is good), but for Dredd fans, it can be a hard pill to swallow with all itserrors.
B00D5O7BPU|2.0|While accurate in it's depiction of some basic WWII weaponry, the app doesn't do anything !!!  pull the trigger and get a 'realistic' feel of shooting a Thompson sub machine gun, or a Sturmgewehr.  that is all it does.  no strategy, nothin'...

B000QGEB12|5.0|I bought this because I lost my previous copy. This movie is amazing. I remember picking it up years ago at Walmart in the $5 bin. I had seen parts of it previously and decided to get it. I am by no means into Kung Fu movies or martial arts...besides IP Man. But this movie was great. I was hilarious. I didn't expect that. Even with subtitles, it was still kick axe!
B0049OSQ18|2.0|I really couldn't get into this album. I had some issues getting into The Hazards of Love, too, but a few instances of some of the songs randomly playing made me listen through it in the proper order (I originally didn't realize it was meant to be listened in order) made me fall in love. This was not the case with this album. Almost every song makes me cringe and wonder what the hell they were thinking. This album is just a whole lot of 'no'.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Great adapter for connecting my FireWire cable to my Macs that have only Thunderbolt ports.<br /> Only bad thing I see about this adapter is the price.<br />I recommend the product, give it five stars.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|Perfect adapter for connecting my Wi-Fi-ONLY computers (Apple Macs) directly to my router.<br />Wi-Fi is convenient, but hardwired is much faster.  As soon as I got off of wireless, and connected this adapter to my ethernet cable, transfer speed increase was obvious.  Another benefit for hardwired, is that it is more secure than wireless.  In this day and age, that's a good thing.<br /> Many hotels throughout the world do not offer in-room wireless, only ethernet cable option. Apple MacBook air has no ethernet port connection.  This Ethernet to Thunderbolt adapter solves that problem.<br />So I say, &#34;I love it.&#34;  Internet access safer and faster. What's not to like about that?<br />Worst thing about this adapter; the price.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I mean no disrespect with the term \\"second\\" but let's face it, there are 2 different eras for this band, you all know what I mean so I will skip the details. Bottom line this IS a good album, sure not to disappoint old-school fans of the band like myself. Slow, heavy, and grungy, what else did you expect. Perhaps not a 5-star album like their last one but this one rocks just as much. My favorite songs are Stone, Voices, and Breath on a Window. I don't know why many people are complaining about the production, this sucker sounds GREAT in my car! Can't wait for their European tour.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Almost all of my favourite artists list Queen as THEIR favourite artist, and it doesn't take much listening to see why.<br /><br />A perfect collection including all your favourites, and some you might not know you love. Because most of us are so familiar with Queen already, I'll simply say this is a fantastic collection, a great value, and the AutoRip feature getting it to you quicker than the post office is great! They gathered such a variety from Queen's history for the Platinum Collection.<br /><br />Pros: Everything - spans a wonderful range of musical styles, great singing, silly nonsense and intelligent depth.<br /><br />Cons: The &#34;Another One Bites the Dust&#34; remix...unnecessary. Skip it every time.
B003K16P3M|5.0|From the first chapter, I knew that this was a book I wouldn't want to end. It didn't disappoint. I can't wait for the next one.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|Quincy and MJ definitely made a classic. As part of the younger generation, I never knew a Michael who wasn't under suspicion of some heinous crimes, but this album definitely deserves its status. Every song is fun, sounds great, sung well, and clearly put together by lots of talented musicians. My personal favourite is P.Y.T, but the McCartney duo, Beat it, and Billie Jean will stick with you long after we stop seeing them in commercials and movie trailers.<br /><br />Even just to understand pop culture and music history you should be familiar with this album, but as a fan of decidedly non-pop genres, I still can't ever stray far from Thriller (or Bad, for that matter).<br /><br />The must have when you wanna be startin' somethin'!

I have a Fire HD, and it took several attempts to download, but it eventually worked, and once it was on my Kindle, it ran fine.  Someone else complained that this all took place in a small environment.  The game is called &quot;The Room,&quot;so no surprises about the setting, which is, shockingly, in...um...a room.<br />As for the game itself, it is remarkably beautiful, and if you like &quot;figure out this clue so you can press that button and reveal a new clue&quot; type games, you'll love The Room.  Sure, I wish it had been longer, but the depth that was in the game made up for it.  I'll definitely be looking for the sequel.

Not the best data recovery software but you do get it for free with an 18 dollar enclosure.<br /><br />Awesome.

B008GXHOFW|4.0|Everything is very fun. It's just that the graphics are crappy as heck. The character is pixelated but all it gives is a reflective light on the character. Spider-Man looks like a man with a square colored costume with shine. Someone please reply back if you know what's wrong or can fix it. It just feels no fun with crappy graphics.
0783233477|5.0|Love the plot, makes you think of the supernatural world and the many unanswered questions we all have.  Top drawer
B004EF6632|5.0|This is a great show; my favorite British period piece.<br /><br />It DOES NOT star Kirsty Allie as Amazon shows in the cast info in the program.  This N&S stars Daniela Denby-Ashe, Richard Armitage, Tim Pigott-Smith.  Check it out on IMDB.
B001UDPAB0|5.0|Excellent twisting plots, keep you guessing. Each movie is unique, and never more of the same ole same ole.  Highly recommend adding to the collection
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Truly great movies don't come along every week.  This one is worth all I paid for it and more.  I've watched it twice already and will watch it repeatedly.  It is about peace, the kind achieved through the hell of war, deceit and treachery, contrasted with purposeful sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This game is very fun but some on them are hard but that just means it makes the game even more fun and challanging .

B00CW665VI|5.0|Oh my gosh...this book. This book is truly one of the best reads I've had on my list in a while. It was funny, sexy, and certainly romance at it's best. The story is narrated by Drew and I absolutely loved it. I felt like I was sitting with him in his office listening to his story. I devoured this book in one sitting and was sad when it ended, because I wanted MORE Drew!<br /><br />This book is about Drew and his journey in figuring out he's in love. The thought scares him to death and literally makes him ill. See, he's never been in love before and never really saw the white picket fence in his future. In fact, Drew has always been a love em' and leave em' kind of guy. He's always respectful to his lady friends, but he never stuck around for seconds. But, he was always honest about it. You have to appreciate honesty. I know I do. What I learned about Drew was that I absolutely adored him! I mean I was in love with him within the first page. In fact, I think I sent Andrea a message about how much I loved the book within the first chapter. Turns out that Drew is a really great guy. He's charming, funny, and prrrrr.......sexy! And honestly, I think a lot like a dude, so I could relate to Drew. Scary, I know, but ask my husband and he'll verify that statement. So, who's the lucky lady that captured his heart? That would be Kate.<br /><br />Kate is the perfect match for Drew. She challenges Drew not only at work, but she makes him acknowledge his feelings. I really liked Kate. I was a bit nervous at first about how the story was going to go with her fiance, but once I understood their situation, my nerves disappeared. (And FYI, this is not a love triangle situation.) Kate's a strong chick, which I appreciate, but she is also wants to love and be loved.<br /><br />Are you curious about the sexy scenes??? Well, I'm happy to say that the sex scenes didn't disappoint. They were on par with the rest of the book in quality and enjoyment. I wouldn't classify this book as erotica, but there is a lot of sexual reference and when Drew and Kate finally got it done....their sexual chemistry was explosive!<br /><br />Overall, I loved Tangled and can't recommend this book enough! When I first got the book from the publisher, I thought it looked cute, but really had no idea about what a great find this was! I feel like I highlighted the entire book. Oh, and I have to mention the supporting characters. I loved them all. Especially Delores. She scared me and made me laugh! I would love to learn more about her. If you like funny and sexy romances, you won't want to miss this one. Add it to your TBR NOW!<br /><br />Quotes:<br />~She has the full attention of every man in the place. But her eyes...those stunning onyx eyes...are looking right at me. And it makes me feel like a god.-Loc 1175<br /><br />~\\"Delores is a gorgeous name, for a gorgeous girl.

B00005B36H|4.0|Not my favorite Tool cd, but a good one anyway.  Can't go wrong with Tool. Some different songs you never hear on the radio, which is always nice.
0553801473|3.0|Seriously, Mr. George R.R. Martin, EXPLETIVE (you know them all!) you!  After finally finishing your most recent book, almost 1000 dense hardback pages, and this is what you give us?  (Check that, it's really 2000 pages, since the last two volumes were really one book, despite their mammoth girth!)  And yes, I admit (1) it's my fault for being stupid and stubborn enough to keep reading, and (2) I DID enjoy a lot of the textures of the book, the world, the characters, the history.  But this is what you give your readers after plowing through that many words, with respect to plot development, and dare I say, the tiniest bit of satisfaction after you have subjected us to so much cruelty and unfairness?  Taking both books into account, here is how almost all the individual plotlines are resolved, in terms of beginning to end for each character's arc through these two books: (1) Nothing really happens at all. (2) Something is about to happen, but you don't tell us what it is.  (3) Something depressing happens.  And, for the latter, in classic Martin tradition, it's not \\"depressing\\" in terms of some grand moving sacrifice, or a tragic resolution of a hero's flaws.  No, it's a depressing action that's a combination of cheap, senseless, stupid, frustrating, mixed with the thought that you may pull a cheaper ploy and find a way to unmake it again and not really have it happen.  I know you consider your brave choice to let main characters die some bold stroke of additional poignancy, but whether it was just obnoxious or brilliant to begin with, at best now it has become a cheap trick.  Rather like rubbing dirt on a steak. Yes, no one else does it, but there is probably a reason they don't do it.  Because it is obnoxious and spoils things.  But once you're rubbing dirt onto the 6th steak you serve me, it's even worse, and even the possible virtue of innovation has gone away.
B005SZNZAY|4.0|Love my Chris, but this is a rehashing of a lot of the old songs which I already have on other cds. Otherwise a good cd.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We just bought this a few weeks ago for my 3 month old.  She can't reach the floor yet even on the lowest setting, but we just put a pillow underneath and she can bounce away.  She loves the blinking lights and sounds and the fact that the seat swivels and full 360 degrees around.  I like that the back of the seat comes up high to protect her head if she gets a little too bouncy in there.  It is a little bulky, but that's because it has so many toys to play with all the way around.  It is sturdy and well made and keeps her entertained for a long time. It was very easy to put together, took about 10 min. including taking it out of the packaging.  I was looking at another jumper, but kept reading reviews that said they wished they had gone with the Rainforest Jumperoo or that they eventually ended up with this one anyways so I decided to purchase this one from the start and definitely do not regret it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of great games.  some very easy.  some very challenging.  would recommend.  something for everyone.  only played a few of the games so far. still working ontrying to unlock others
B00C7JFIRC|3.0|First off I like the movie, but I am upset that the movie will not play in dts hd. I have a 5.1 system hd, the movie will only support 7.1 in order for my receiver to decoded it. Disney did rip us off for this blu-ray!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The kindle has needed a game like this for a lomg time. Great to pass a little time and the controles are not to shabby.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|OMG what the hell was that, the ending alone I would literally give 1 star that was rubbish!! I'm not pulling any punches its like there was a chapter or two or something missing that made the story actually end on a cliffhanger with the expectation of another book.<br /><br />LUCKILY the rest of the book was well worthy of 4 stars, but if your looking for an ending there wasn't one.<br /><br />&lt;b> &#34;If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would inextricably be entwined.&#34; &lt;/b><br /><br />The possessive love in this book was almost surreal, it was hot hot hot, Gideon and Eva are simply perfection together, two halves of the same whole, owned by each other in every way,.. Every single way!<br /><br />Something big is going to go down in book 4, something that is going to tear their world apart, we don't know what but Entwined with you just had way too much success in the Gideon Eva relationship area, almost to the point that it is becoming cliche and boring!  what has happened to Megumi?? The redhead?? Gideons mother??, Cary Tatiana Trey?? BRETT?!?! Corrine?? I have so many questions I'm just argh angry!!<br /><br />I'm lost and so angry about that ending I'm tempted to change my review to 3 stars.<br /><br />Still, don't get me wrong, I loved the book :-)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You know a book is good when it makes you cry, but you still want to go back and read more.
1604680547|5.0|This is a very useful format with sturdy, water resistant, hard back, and spiral page attachments.  The already to-scale images can be easily copied for creating templates.  Contains a wide verity of innovative designs including many traditional standards.  Contains only two pages of very through and well organized instructions with all of the remaining pages saturated with templates.  A great buy that is definitely worth the price.<br /><br />As a regular machine free-motion quilter I of course would have preferred that it contain only continuous line designs, although the hand stitching designs were impressive and in some cases can be adapted for free motion and visa versa.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie for the cinematography and the fighting action. It's a typical kung-fu type movie with a pretty good story, no complaints from me!
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Pros: App itself runs well and does exactly what it says it does.  I have been able to 'scan' many items and then send them off to people or keep them my own personal use.<br /><br />Cons:  Took a little time to figure some functions out as its not very straight forward.  'Scanning' colored pages end up in a black/white, grey scale, which like real scanners/copiers are not always the best of quality.<br /><br />Overall: Pretty good app for the price and what it does.  I would recommend if you need to have the ability to quickly scan things while on the go.  Do spend a little time getting to know the app to avoid any frustrations you may have.

B00BI73CVI|5.0|Amazing. One word..Amazing. This story has to be divinely inspired. I've never truly liked or saw a musical. I had no idea what I was in for with this. 3 hrs later, I'm surrounded by tissues. But I feel amazingly uplifted. Pure genius in the over all book/play. But since I've seen no others, THIS  was fantastic.<br />I honestly want to thank these people for touching my heart :)making me question, self, society, friendship, brotherhood, family, motherhood, fatherhood, dogma, faith, and in the end and throughout....grace

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini gets better with each story he constructs. And the Mountains Echoed is Pulitzer-worthy.  Hosseini has the ability to phrase passages that are shear poetry.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia Day you promised from the beginning this was a three part series how dare you now turn around and get money hungry by trying to make it five part; and now you're losing your fan base!  You should be ashamed of yourself!!!!!!!!!!!! We all earn a living and work hard for what we earn - you have not earned 9.99 of our hard earned cash for this morkery of a part three in attempts to drag it out to five series.  I will be returning my book after this review as suggested by other former loyal customers.<br /><br />Amazon should put a stop to this drama of price gouging!!! After waiting months Sylvia Day now thinks she can turn the series whichever way she pleases - no ma'am you cannot!  I am done with this series - shame on you for stretching a great series into a travesty.  Did you not learn from FSOG - it ended in three series, anythhing more loses the plot, waters the relationship or the strength of the thick story line!<br /><br />Above all anything beyond three parts is \\"DAYLIGHT ROBBERY\\" and we're not having it!  You should have written the story thick with the answers that you promised Sylvia and ended a great series like your fans were promised!<br /><br />I am beyond disappointed!<br />Refund will be instantly requested after this!!!!!!!!

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app is somewhat challenging but is so fun. You'll enjoy wasting time with it and it will keep the kids busy. I recommend it.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|It is a great action figure and such a good addition. To my collection. I thank bandai for this!!!!! I have bin happy for this
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful.  Heartwarming.  Heartbreaking.  Humorous within its darkest moments, which is how we lived within the timeline of our own son.  This story made me want to curl up in someone`s lap and mourn for a life that is not and for the lives that cannot...  and for those that must anyway.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|I downloaded the game put in my character name but i couldn't connect to a match i logged in but it didn't work and it said i wasn't signed in. I want to play this game thought

B009ME47H2|5.0|Much better than easy sound recorder cuz that one would not work but this does so download if u want
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Let me preface this with I had a pilots license, drank a lot, used cocaine occasionally, and totally understood the pilots thoughts. Denzel Washington does a terrific job representing a person that has severe problems with life and uses anything to get his thoughts off of them. He is very skilled and saves most of the plane. I won't say anymore of this but it is well done, well told, and a must see for anyone that has been in it, or knows someone in a similar situation.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I find it annoying that I. order to earn additional coins or features you have to invite friends or tweet
B008JJM88Q|5.0|and since you can put in the name of any well known person, I find out who interests them by who they choose and when it is my turn  I put in Presidents and other famous historical figures and we discuss why they are famous. Educational and fun!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I saw this movie  advertised but don't really like buying movies without seeing first. Watched it and loved it. Bought right after it ended. This was an excellent way to check out a movie if your too lazy to head to a Red Box and rent one.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|\\"You're a monster Zod.... and I am going to stop you\\"<br /><br />Man Of Steel, Warner Brothers last attempt at putting superman on the big screen and doing it right. With alot riding on this movie including the DC franchise this movie tries to bring superman to the 21st century as they are beginning to fall behind of Marvel in their successes. Did it deliver? There is very little to not love about this movie.<br /><br />all I can say is that Henry Cavil delivered big time. I am not going to say anything that takes place in the movie but I will say that It is visually stunning, crisp and packed full of action that is needed for a superman movie. The backstory of clark is done very well and the action is superb. For those who complained and felt that superman returns was terrible, dont worry this is nothing like it. This takes superman to all new heights and delivers with a bang. A must watch and must own for any superman lover. Cannot wait for the sequel which is already underway. The only complains that I have heard is that it has changed superman too much from the Christopher Reeves superman we have all seen. I was never a fan of those superman movies as I found them to be too cheesy for my taste but I read the comics and watched the cartoons so I had no issues with this movie in any way.<br /><br />Excellent movie 10/10
B0085YOD1A|3.0|The application adds little more information than what is already available on the android. The best feature is probably the health of the battery, but I don't know if this is accurate.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love, love, love this app. I've tried a few different dictionary apps and this one is, by far, the best one yet. It's simple to use and I like that each word has an audio clip attached to it in case you don't know how to pronounce it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing and great game! Never gets boring. My little brother loves to try and beat my high score all the time.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Bought two and they fit perfectly.. We're a family of Apple devices and these cases will protect your investment.  Might get a few more as gifts :)
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This is a great movie.  It was made in 1951 and I first viewed it as a kid and remembered how much I liked it then.  I just viewed it again and reconfirmed that it was an outstanding movie with my favorite male and female actors.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so touching. I could not put it down. The dialogue had to have been so tricky. It was told from Jack's (the little boy) point of view. I could almost hear him talking. It made my heart skip beats and also made my heart melt. It was amazing.

1612185495|5.0|Ian Fleming's ability to write a spine tingling tale continues in this particular Bond thriller.  All of his books are so much better than any of the movies (if you are wondering) and really worth the read.  Knowing that Fleming lived in Jamaica and wrote a lot of stories there makes this particular book even more interesting.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|My son has been obsessed with all things garbage/recycling for more than three years! I purchased this for his sixth birthday (it was the only item on his wish list!).  He loves it and plays with it multiple times daily.  It has held up well so far (two months).

B008B8AOQI|5.0|Why has it taken me so long to discover Passenger?? Absolutely LOVE this CD. I can't remember the last time I listened to a CD on repeat for so long (probably when Kris Kross came out with Jump...probably shouldn't admit that ;-). Every time I listen to it, a new layer seems to appear out of nowhere. If you like indie-folk with clever and deep lyrics, you will not be disappointed!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|So, let's get this out of the way. (Insert knee-jerk \\"not helpful\\" vote here.) Is Superman a Christ-figure? The answer is, yes, of course. But it's not the fault of the movie - it's always been that way. Alien sent to earth by father, takes on the nature of a human being, but he's still much more than that, etc. etc. ... that's part of the Superman mythos. Sure, there's the cross-pose in space, and he \\"descends into Hades\\", and so on, in this movie. But just because it retells themes of The Greatest Story, doesn't mean it can't be fun. And, generally, it is.<br /><br />On the flip side, it also exposes the dark side of Darwinism - the conclusion that the strong should rule the weak. That's exactly what Hitler based his holocaust upon, and the historical records show it. Hitler sought to exterminate the Church because the Nazis considered her care for the weak \\"effete\\" and \\"anti-evolutionistic\\". Darwin himself lamented that \\"We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. ... Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man.\\" This is a sentiment echoed aloud by the bad guys here.<br /><br />Well, I think they erred on making Clark so buffed. It takes away from his \\"ordinariness\\" on the human side. But the other parts and ideas of the reboot are interesting. His weakness is no longer Kryptonite, for example, but something that makes a bit more sense. Couldn't explain the flying, but then again, no one can.<br /><br />Interesting questions are posed. Should he let a bus of kids drown? His dad gives us an answer that makes us uneasy. Krypton has abandoned \\"natural\\" birth, opting for programmed traits a al \\"Brave New World\\" where everyone's job is determined. This is contrasted to our own vision of individual choice. Zod's anguish at the end when his life-purpose is destroyed is also disquieting. And raises questions regarding what it means to be human and the nature of idolatry - centering your life around something that will, in the end, betray you.<br /><br />This film is epic in the way \\"Thor\\" should have been, instead of being played out in some dinky town. But in the last part of the movie, there were WAAAAAAY too many explosions and general destruction. I understand why they did it - it had to be a big battle - but after a while it just became numbing (boom boom boom crash etc.). And the final act with Zod was strangely muted.<br /><br />There are great visuals and effects, and Jor-El is much more prominent here, in a welcome way. The Krypton tech seems a bit klunky to us viewers used to looking at colorful displays, but that's aliens for you.<br /><br />The logic of the hapless Krypton council also seems hokey. Surely they could have seen their destruction coming and escaped. And surely some of their outposts could have begun supporting themselves. But that's the setup. Just go with it.<br /><br />Some critics complained that Lois and Clark didn't click. It didn't seem that way to me.<br /><br />The last line was pretty good.<br /><br />All in all, enjoyable and spectacular, but for the mind-numbing destruction marathon, which could have been 20 minutes shorter. 3.5 stars would be more accurate.w World\\" where everyone's job is determined.

B001PJRAUS|1.0|The creation and depiction of the character Amanda was a bizarre choice. She has supposedly read Pride and Prejudice dozens of times and knows most of the text by heart. If that's true, she appeared dreadfully uninformed about how to behave after entering the 19th century. Her constant fumbling and screwing things up was beyond ridiculous, and her crass crudity was just wrong. She was a stupid and witless character with a bucket-mouth. Her crudity and stupidity was no doubt gratuitously done, given modern audiences and films, but to do this with Pride and Prejudice? It isn't even worthy of being called a joke, much less a fantasy. A disposable film rating 0 stars, if I could have.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game!!! My kids even love it. This game is a stress reliever and helps to pass the time.
0345525558|4.0|My book club selected this novel for our June meeting. I probably would not have read this book based on the blurb on the back, but I'm really glad our hostess chose it. There were thought provoking issues raised within the nicely crafted plot which made it a good read and a nice discussion starter. The only negative for me was the alternating chapters which I felt created some \\"spoilers\\" in the unfolding plot. The group loved it too!
B008DYZKQE|2.0|My 7-year old daughter wasn't impressed. Neither was I. Who wrote this, a feminist? Short, inconsequential, boring. Bring on the classics.
0670014893|5.0|Le Carre, one of the great contemporary writers, has morphed into one of the great political polemicists.  Whether his target is big pharma (The Constant Gardener), big money (Our Kind of Traitor) or the privatization of intelligence (A Delicate Truth), he drives home his message with character-driven narratives which make the pulse race and the blood boil.

B001EC0OMM|5.0|This is a classic and one of my family's favorites.  Jimmy Stewart is exceptional in it.  Lots of fun scenes and interactions.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Wise Man's Fear is an excellent read for anyone who has a good vocabulary and loves a compelling saga.<br /><br />The prologue and epilogue are exceptionally unusual and have the capacity to kidnap a reader's attention.  I was intrigued with Kvothe's search for knowledge in The Name of the Wind, and Wise Man's Fear only served to compel me into further identifying with the character - in some cases, quite passionately.  I did find a couple of (probably inconsequential) logic holes in Kvothe's telling that doubtless the writer would have addressed, but to point them out would be a waste of time if the author has a use for them later on.<br /><br />One question for anyone still reading this review (especially the author): Regarding the 'well-traveled' letter Kvothe carefully prepares for Ambrose; was the antagonist's subsequent reaction meant to be left to the reader's imagination?  Or did I miss something?<br /><br />Until you find time to finish the next part of Kvothe's tale, I can be patient; to rush such a continuance would be to risk losing the richness of the fantasy you've built.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I love this product, easy to navigate on the grid as well as make quick and easy changes to current game board. Difficulty levels are game worthy and benefit the beginners as well as the challenge levels.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really looking forward to book 3 of the Cross series, but found this one quite boring with very little plot.  The ending was very abrupt & came when there was a story line finally starting.  This book is basically about the sex lives of Eva & Gideon, very little else.  This could have been a short story published in Penthouse magazine.  I really hope the next book is better.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|when i first opened the box everything was fine, but when i plugged it into the car it didn't want to go in right away aka it was really tight...but i got it in and i kept looking at my phone to see if the chargeing indicator would show up and it never showed up that it was charging...so i moved it around a little bit and got a connection then i let go and it stayed charging for 3 sec. then stopped. i pulled it out and the tip on the end was stuck and wouldn't extend so i wedged the tip out of the hole and moved around the plastic on the outside of the usb ports and then it finally would extend and contract so i plugged it in and it is still having charging problems.  i got it to work at a certain angle but it won't always stay. right now i am planning on getting a different one cuz this one just doesn't keep charging...
1589949811|4.0|As a player of numerous CCGs and games, I was taken aback by this product when I heard of it. The game bills itself as a card game where all the boosters give you the whole set. No more $3 purchases where you go off and get a crap rare. Then, I saw it was Co-Op. I began to have some flashbacks to Simcity by this point. I decided to roll the dice on this one and hope for the best. It was worth the chance.<br /><br />First off, the game comes with four starters, one for each theme. Some of them work better than others, but all have different strategies to help you win. The part that makes this game is the staging area in the center. All the players are trying to beat back the evil that's threatening to halt their progress. The staging area, and center in general is a really great mechanic. If you don't have anyone nearby, have no fear. This game works well solo. Just be careful what deck you take solo, as some can be painful to play.<br /><br />The game is easily taught to others. I have a seven year old boy who now plays like a pro after 10 minutes of instruction. Once you understand the basics of the phases and how the play works, it makes sense, and becomes quite easy. The cards are clearly worded, and have wonderful artwork. It was nice to see new, fresh pictures of Tolkien's work instead of the recycled movie images.<br /><br />The tokens are high quality, another shock as I was expecting tokens a-la Pokémon. These are beefy, tough cardboard tokens. The threat counter is made of the same material, and is easily constructed. The colors and images on these tokens is wonderful, and truly a marvel to behold.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings LCG was an impressive surprise. I regret having waited so long to attempt a plunge into this masterful game. I will most certainly be looking forward to getting the adventure packs that are being produced for this, to see just what's coming next. With a new set every month, the future for this game seems extremely bright.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Great cd. Good songs. When they first started they were my daughter favorite group and now they are older I am enjoying them.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|LOVE this case!  It's so streamlined, fits the Kindle Fire perfectly and it's sturdy.  The white is perfect because it's easy to find in a bag and the price was totally reasonable.  Putting the Kindle Fire in the case took 5 seconds.  I would highly recommend this product.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the third book in the Outlander series.  The books are very good with such vivid details that make you feel like you are experiencing everything happening.  I plan to read all of the books in the series.

1594136238|5.0|Although I got the large print version and it was over 600 pages, It was a fast read.  Hard to put down and held your attention all the way through.  Our book club is going to review this in July.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was the best I've played in a while. It kept me thinking and there where enough activities so I didn't get bored like some games that I have played. Definitely worth the five bucks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun so y'all should get this game. I love this game so much y'all will love it to.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|We tried to sit through the movie because we were certain that actors as good as Tom Hanks and Halle Berry could make even a poor story exciting.  The entire patchwork of stories dealing with reincarnation were only a distraction from the real message of unrequited homosexual love.  The interplay between the gay, star crossed lovers, never destined to be together, was offensive and disgusting.  We had no intention of sitting our family in front of the TV to watch a movie which sought sympathy for homosexuals.  No where in society today, do we see gays being restricted from being with whomever they desire.<br />The confusing and overlapping reincarnation stories were offensive to our Biblical views of life and death. Shame on you, Mr. Hanks and Ms Berry, for allowing your acting talents to be used simply to promote an anti-Christian movie.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I love these songs. Her voice is so perfect for this kind of music. Nice assortment of songs. I recommend it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|the picture is so clear a 3D picture couldn't. be much better. it's so good I got it for myself. I'm having a good time and I'm 48yrs old.  I like this as much as I did.  where's my water also by Disney.&quot;

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Hardly load pictures in news feed. Very laggy and very buggy! Please fix this app! I prefer to use website than with this app.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|This movie is truly ludicrous, absurd, hilarious. It goes all over the place, and I think it is one of the funniest horror films ever made. It is ridiculous in the extreme. I wish more pure nonsense movies like this were being made. I am all for a return of the Theatre of the Absurd.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Again, you cannot go wrong with DM...this one is, well is \\"catchy\\"...i know it doesn't sound right but for me it's true. After one listen I knew every single word for the second go around... Playing the Angel is definitely my get me out of a slouch mood music...
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works well.  Just don't forget to leave the device turned on.<br />Like the options for the clock faces.  Overall very well done.
B000002LCI|5.0|It is just so cool to hear early Depeche Mode such as MFM... I grew up with their music just as much of you, molding their music into our theme songs of life. And today when you here their songs on the radio, you instantly know it and start singing before they do! But as their sound changed over the years, so did we, never missing a single beat. So with 30 years and 13 albums later, I tip my hat to them and say Bravo! and Here! Here! to those of us fans who now feel like proud parents :)
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Wonderful songs, easy to listen to and relaxing.  The girls have great voices and are very comforting to listen to.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Please do not take my review the wrong way, is not meant to offend...yes with any band, when a member leaves they take with them the sound/style they brought to it. So the remaining members have to choose to either dissipate or reinvent themselves. Depeche Mode has gone through many a reinvention with Clarke's departure and then with Wilder's. Even Gahan's stint with drugs was a form of reinvention for him as a person and for the band as a whole... this and every album since, along with Clarke and Wilder's mark are what has made DM who they are today. Could they have made it if they did not reinvent with each set back? I don't know, maybe? All I know is that they are a truly great band.<br />  Ultra has an array of sounds that just relaxes you into chill mode the minute you push play. As many reviewers said, Ultra is one that shouldn't be overlooked by any DM fan and they're right, you shouldn't. This is my 3rd favorite DM album.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|{4.25 stars}<br /><br />This film's upholders rave about how brilliant and meaningful it is, while its detractors rant about how pretentious and nonsensical it is.<br /><br />I can see both sides of the argument, but let me just say this. One has to have 3 solid hours and a great deal of patience to spare before watching CLOUD ATLAS. Anyone who has those 2 things and views this film fairly attentively should at least see that the plot-line DOES make sense. Not having read David Mitchell's original novel, I know I missed a few things on first view, and the beginning in particular was mind-blendingly confusing. We generally expect the opening of a story/film to \\"hook\\" us, establish the basic cast of characters and conflicts, and all that sort of stuff. This would be hard to accomplish in a work of this sort, which is a bit like [[ASIN:B000HAB4KS The Matrix]] meets [[ASIN:6304806426 The English Patient]].<br /><br />I stayed with CLOUD ATLAS, and though it wore me out, I was able to appreciate the whole story of domino effects spanning over centuries of human history: How acts of both kindness and malice trickle down, ripple out, and so forth. There's nothing \\"brilliant\\" or even particularly original about that, but I know of very few films that tie together so many settings in time and place this well.<br /><br />CLOUD ATLAS may not seem like the sort of thing to see for easy entertainment, but I think the best advice comes from several other reviewers who recommend just watching this film for \\"the ride.\\" The cinematography, setting and costume design, and special effects are all quite amazing even by today's standards. You don't have to catch all the details to appreciate what's basically going on here, and new stuff will emerge with each re-view.<br /><br />And if you don't like it, well, just turn it off.
B000KN9G4S|5.0|After reading mixed reviews on here and on iTunes, I decided to buy it thinking it's Depeche Mode it cannot be that bad...And it really isn't. At first listen I thought huh, interesting. Now it lives in my home player...and after a day of work, I push play and unwind...and it's my house cleaning theme music too lol<br />It took me a day or two to really get into the groove of it but it is definitely worth a space in one's DM collection.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was so impressed with this movie I saw it 3 times!  My norm is to never see a movie twice and I got even more out of it each time I saw it.  Very deep and yet entertaining.  Extremely well done, highly recommended, great actors!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome!  it is like an arcade! or at least an arcade with 101 + 31 games.  I have completed all of the games except one game in the first section.  I love this thank u AMAZON!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I was impressed with the movie addressing a topic that is just not okay to think about or discuss.  All actors were great at their roles, recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love the story, however, there were too many loose ends. Who killed the so call mob guy, what is going to happen to Corinne and the situation with losing the baby, what about Eve' s sex tape issue, what about finally telling everyone Gideon and Eve are already married, and what about the relationship between Mrs. Vidal and Eve? I feel like I got jipped. How can an author introduce readers to a murder and not finish the plot. I feel that the author was pressed for time in finishing this book that she didn't not how to end it, because of the so many situations she put into the book. If I wanted to invest in a book that never ended, I would stick to watching soap opera. Once again, this proves that no author can stand up to E. L. James's 50th Shades.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I Truly enjoyed the challenge.  There were moments when I thought I would never get the next move. Be patient, you'll get it.
0786955570|5.0|This wasn't the first D&D board game I played, but it was the first one made and I have to say it seems to be the hardest for a party to legitimately win.  Even my 12 year old girl and 10 your old boy enjoy playing it on family game night.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's interesting but it can get boring. Though it was still worth the download. I like the 3 dimensional effects. It makes the horse seem more realistic.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Although this doesn't reach the high points of Angles in that there is no track as good as \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" this is a much more consistent album. Like everyone has mentioned this is a very 80's sounding album.  Don't let the the naysayers fool you. If this album had been released by any other band the critics would be all over it. This blows away Phoenix's last offering. Pick it up and give it a good listen.  You won't be disappointed.
B00542UMIY|5.0|My kids loved it!They watched it over and over.  No profanity, no worries.  Just what this parent is looking for.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Love this series of books!!  Janet Evanovich tells a great story.  Makes you really feel for Stephanie and all her problems.
B00973902K|5.0|The kids really get into the rhythm and beat of this song.  It has become incredibly popular with the younger kids.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Really good book, But think it's aimed more at teenager's and young adults. Reminded me of a mix between Lord of The Rings and Harry potter stories. I would recommend though as it's a good read.
1451648537|5.0|I read few pages with breakfast only, and I finished it after 10 months. I enjoyed it! It's like watching a movie during breakfast! Steve's life is really unusual, and the author was really good in arranging it. In terms of joy, it was like the biography &#34;Open&#34;.<br /><br /> It is very neutral that you won't necessarily end up loving the person or empathizing with him! His psychological issues were laid in the open, and he got great chances in his life that he exploited superbly; along with his courage and necessary stubbornness.<br /><br />Some people think that such personality is a must for such success, but that's not accurate. He was talented, smart, charismatic & lucky, yet luck favors the prepared. and he was always prepared.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm ready for the next installment!  I was sad to think it was going to be over... Ha!  Now I have more to look forward to.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|You can't connect. When you try it logs you out and it loops in a hug circle. I only got to play once and it was fun but you can't even play!
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Some wonderfully creepy moments and amazing acting from the two little girls, but the plot was completely predictable, the dialogue was boring, and the whole thing was non-stop horror cliche, full of obviously contrived situations. I was especially irritated when characters started \\"investigating\\" AT NIGHT, without any compelling reason not to wait for daylight. Who the hell goes--alone--into a scary cabin in the middle of nowhere to confront a supernatural being in the dark? And then his flashlight goes out? Hard to stay invested when the writers are being lazy. I loved \\"Pan's Labyrinth,\\" \\"The Orphange\\" and \\"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\\" but this one was just...dull.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|This is exactly what I think Batman would be like in his old age.  Not too much to say other than: Badass.
B002ZG997M|4.0|The ending was a little surprising but when I re-watched it I saw the clues in regards to the big reveal at the end. The whole religious thing was kind of off putting for me but the doom and gloom after the apocalypse thing was what pulled me in.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Good trilogy . It has everything : love, Betrayal , action, reality and fiction  Could not put it down until I was done with all the books.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Crazy movie. I was kind of shocked by this movie. I'm not sure what to say other than it's a little freaky how two half brothers fall in love with each other and stay together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It shows that the app is really a great deal of time and money on the game but you not have  to buy the game.
B00CDPP9X8|2.0|I am English, catching up on the 'classics' I didn't have time for when I was younger.  This novel deals mainly with unmarried young women living in upper-middle class society in the English countryside, in the 18th century.  It is very slow-moving for a modern reader, with a very detailed examination of the female characters but with the males only lightly sketched, as ciphers, with the first point always being their income!  One sister is to show 'sense', the other 'sensibility', and the story is carefully planned to bring this out.  I found Pride and Prejudice an improvement, and Mansfield Park much better.  As to Sense and Sensibility, a DVD of a TV version is probably better for the modern reader.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love texting my friends on kik i always get my other friends on here cos this app is so amazingly AWESOME
B00BOQPSGU|3.0|An improvement on 'Sense and Sensibility' but still slow-moving due to the English social customs and manners of the 18th century.<br />The (modern) direct approach of the characters talking to each other openly is taboo - instead we get agonised speculation drawn out over many pages.  Again here a DVD/TV version is probably better - or read Mansfield Park first.  Again here we have 'cipher' characters, one representing Pride and the other Prejudice, and modern credibilities are stretched as the characters are kept strictly within these moulds.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Updated 2013- This Facebook app is easy to download, you can access messages and updates without any trouble, it does anything that Facebook on the computer would do. 1 or 2 minor problems here and there such as, network errors which eventually log you out of your account, and (for people who own Kindle Fires) Facebook would, at some points, stop working, but I'd say this is the best Facebook app you can purchase for free on the Appstore.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|The book was great, slow at parts, I wished it went into more detail in terms of the story lines, but it was terrifically written, and it managed to keep me engaged throughout most of it!
1452113432|2.0|The little kitchen of the title refers to the cooking arrangement in her Paris apartment which was minimal.  Since most of us have full-size kitchens, I'm not sure what the point of that is other than \\"see what I can do with practically no equipment\\".  The recipes were the pretty standard French fare somewhat simplified.  There are lots of pictures -closeups of food and over 50 pictures of the author herself.  I've never seen a cookbook with so many pictures of the cook. Many of them are the same subject - the author in a bar with something to drink.  For the price, I think I'd rather have more recipes, less author.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|It was very predictable. Good story though. I laughed, cried, and it made me think. I would recommend this book, for light read.
B00B7VZN76|4.0|There was nothing wrong with anything except the case was broken. I'm looking foward to the rest of the seaons coming out.
0740797719|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about how to paint, and paint with color, instead of just sticking to my line drawings on pencil and paper. This book thrust open the gates for me, as James Gurney breaks every element down into its simplest forms. He discusses the full range of how color and light work in the world, and more importantly how they are perceived through our eyes. His fully colored pictures from his Dinotopia books are what make this more than just a textbook and make it an exciting read, so that the reader may enjoy learning what James Gurney has to offer. I highly recommend it as the go to book for anybody that wants to learn how to paint.
0618680004|5.0|Coming from an ignorant fundamentalist background (ultra-conservative bible colleges included) my skepticism was triggered by the analytical dialogues of Plato. Later I rejected Christianity based on scriptures preposterous claims. The God Delusion was the fist anti-theist book I read. Of course, it was nothing like my long-ago churches or colleges portrayed it: lines of deceiving, devilish rhetoric and in reality a thoughtful, passionate book by a brilliant biologist. In short, The God Delusion brought me, and most reasonably so, out of a placid 'live-and-let-live' or relative mentality of religions and into the conclusion that religion is a dire problem.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|so I tested it and it works amazingly good!!! just turn your sound up. but its best alarm ever must get!!!
B005LAII9O|5.0|Greatly enjoyed the performances of the three main characters.  A peek into two different worlds I wouldn't want to live in.

0345535421|5.0|Ever since I read [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]], I knew I had to read the next book in the series, and it did not disappoint.  When we last left off, King Robert Baratheon is killed (murdered) in a boar hunt and his son (well, actually the child of his wife and her brother) Joffrey has ascended the throne.  Young Joffrey is only a teenager, but a very wicked one, with a penchant for cruelty.  Case in point - he beheads the father of his betrothed, Sansa Stark. in front of her.  The Starks of Winterfell are now led by Sansa's brother, Robb, who declares himself King of the North.  Add two more newly declared Kings to the mix (Joffrey's uncles Stannis and Renly Baratheon) and you have an all-out war.<br /><br />Here are the thoughts and questions that flew through my head as I read this book:<br /><br />What is the real connection between the direwolves and the Stark children?What will be the result when Daenerys Targaryen appears claiming to be Queen over all?<br />How do the dragons stand up against the \\"unknown\\" creatures that will descend from the north?<br />Why do I keep feeling that Tyrion Lannister is a good guy even though he defends his evil family?<br />Will the author kill off more Starks even though I was devastated that Ned Stark was killed?<br /><br />I admit I watched the first season of the HBO series prior to reading this book.  Since I read the first book nearly a year ago, it was very helpful in keeping the characters straight.  Since the second season has already been released on DVD, I may decide not to wait a year for the next book.  And it's a given, I'm going to read it.  I just have to find out what happens next!

159463176X|5.0|No question that Khaled Hosseini is a brilliant storyteller: however, this book is more complex than his two previous books, skipping back and forth in time and switching narrators and scenes. This book might have benefited from a list of principal characters such as the ones found at the beginning of War and Peace or Anna Karenina.  I found myself re-reading sections, thinking I might have missed something when a chapter ended and an entirely new story begins.<br /><br />The preamble, if you will, is a folk tale about a demon who forces families to offer up one child as a sacrifice so the demon does not take all the children and the story begins in an impoverished, tiny Afghan village.<br /><br />We are introduced to the families in Shadbagh, a village similar to the one in the opening tale, especially the children of Saboor and his wife, Parwanna.  Parwanna is the stepmother of Saboor's children, a girl, Pari, aged 3 and Abdullah, age 10.  The children, whose mother died giving birth to Pari, spend their lives in each other's company. They sleep side by side and play together all day.  Parwanna is a sad and detached stepmother, mother to a new baby, Iqbal, over whom she frets and fusses and Abdullah is mother, father and brother to Pari, whom he worships.<br /><br />Parwanna has a brother, Nabi,who is a chauffeur for a wealthy gentleman from Kabul, Mr. Wahdati.  When Nabi visits the village driving his employer's large American car, he is something of a celebrity.  Back in Kabul, however, Nabi lives in a tiny shack in the back yard while Mr. Wahdati putters around his enormous house alone.<br /><br />Nabi and Mr. Wahdati have established a routine which is broken by the employer's marriage to a beautiful but damaged woman, Nila.  Nabi falls hopelessly in love with Nila, thinking of her constantly and plotting for any reason to be in her company.  Nila is plainly unhappy and Nabi sees Mr. Wahdati as an arrogant and uncaring husband and the obvious obstacle to Nila's happiness.  Nabi fantasizes that it is only in his company that Nila is happy and is so besotted he will do anything to advance his standing with her.  It is Nabi's desire for the unattainable Nila that propels the novel forward into tragedy and splinters the characters beyond the confines of the village and even Afghanistan.<br /><br />Each chapter in this book is almost a stand alone story; however, it is not a book one can pick up and read a few pages and return to it later.  It may take more than one reading as there are ripples, followed by undercurrents, followed by deep water, followed by the bottom of the ocean.  The \\"Mountains\\" is not a beach read.  It is a book that deserves time free from distraction.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game took me by surprise. It's a great game for the kindle. The graphics are awesome, as is the story line. Definitely recommend it!!!

0393035158|3.0|I can hear Sam speaking on every page.  There are better works on this topic.  Consider Hitchens or Dawkins if you want concrete examples from religious texts or historical events to support disbelief.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very intense!!  The detail makes the book come alive so much that it makes you feel like you're in it.  It brings out every emotion in the reader--fear, sorrow, excitement, happiness, etc.  I was on the edge of my seat with every word I read!!  Wish there was another book after this:(
B000003CUJ|3.0|I was mistaken in thinking this would include the major sung portions but without text.  It consists of highlights of the major orchestral preludes, interludes, finales, etc.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child, and I that time I thought it was amazing. One of the best movies ever made and everyone should see it.
B004AYCWY4|4.0|Please read the other lengthy reviews of this book if you are interested in details of the work.<br /><br />This is perhaps Dawkins's best work in terms of accessibility of the material for the non-scientists among us.  This work should bring creationism to extinction (not in our lifetime, I'm afraid) or move it to the realm of mythology where it belongs.

B003YUSMUI|5.0|Ok I own two pairs of croc sandals. Both were given to me. I really wanted a pair of red canvas slip ons and these were the only ones I could find under $50. I usually were a 8.5 in womens and I got the 7mens/9 womens. They were comfortable. The padded part around the ankle took a bit to get used to but I wore socks anyway, so it didn't take long to get used to. Now I really had no clue that these would have the Crocs type padded/foam soles. Like I said I've only ever owned the sandals and had no clue that all their shoes are made like this (I'm assuming that now). I was expecting more like a flat, no support sole like my Converse. They were very cushey, only thing was the warning about escalators and moving sidewalks while wearing these? Do what? &#34;To avoid severe personal injury when riding escalators & moving walkways 1. stand in the middle of the step facing forward 2. Do not contact any surface next to step to the mvoing tread or step 3. step carefully when getting on or off 4.Hold children's hand & supervise children at all times&#34; Warning tag on shoes? They wouldn't put it there if they hadn't needed to.

B00CKJTOHO|3.0|Season 1 of Dexter was &#34;edgy&#34;, unique. The story lines were full of suspense, and conflicts reached right down to the emotional level. We were along on Dexter's journey to &#34;discover himself&#34; and navigate life in a world that was morally confusing and ambiguous.<br /><br />Season 2 stayed edgy, and when season 3 started to &#34;lose the edge&#34;, Season 4 came along to become one of the greatest Season's of any show in television history, thanks to an excellent John Lithgow villain, incredible tension and writing, and the culmination of Dexter's emotional Journey.<br /><br />Then the descent into mediocrity began again in earnest. Season 5 picked up where season 3 left off, and the show, while entertaining, was no longer very creative or edgy. Season 6 was downright terrible, and season 7 does little to improve upon season 6. The sophisticated and thoughtful way in which Dexter rationalizes his world of darkness and light, and moral ambiguity is replaced by a feeling that Dexter is like a child with a dark side who is unable to cope. He is lost with his &#34;dark passenger&#34;, his sexual urges, and his relationships with others. Also gone is the prevalent feeling that you were experiencing a little piece of Miami with every episode, the suspense, and the interesting character conflicts.<br /><br />If you like a mediocre soap opera about a childish serial killer who only kills bad guys, watch the show.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love all angry bird games and I love this one with all the birds and monkeys, its so much fun, this one is a must get.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth and Joe together combine their talents in this amazing cd. Got to see Beth in concert in Atlanta in April. One of the best shows I have ever seen!
006112429X|5.0|I came to this book on a recommendation of a friend, and I know now more than ever that she has impeccable taste.<br /><br />This is not, as they would say, a \\"feel good\\" book. On the contrary, I don't think a piece of writing has ever gotten under my skin so thoroughly, in a way to make me feel so...terrified and uncomfortable and uneasy. Yet I couldn't stop reading. There is a rawness and gaping, wide-open honesty about Eva that draws you in. She is, unlike so many people we will encounter during our lives, so unabashedly aware of her shortcomings. Yet even so, she doesn't fall into the simpering role of martyr - there is no, \\"Oh this is all my fault\\" from her. Rather, she stands by everything she has done and felt, which to some make her uncompromising and hateful; to me, it made her incredibly courageous and painfully real.<br /><br />This will, without a doubt, stay on my bookshelf forever. Maybe I'll read it cover to cover again; but even more realistically, I can flip to any point in this book, take a ten-page segment, and find at least one exquisite moment. It is, in a word, riveting.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Fantastic cd! Beth and Joe are the best!! Go see Beth in concert, amazing! Would love to see them in concert together.

1451668945|3.0|The main story is that the primary character is in a coma most of the book as a result of fire at furniture showroom  Mystery of main villain was readily apparent although it had some twists as to motivation. Intertwined with coma victim staging are stories of two missing women of decades ago. Coincidentally both tie into fire scene. Also coincidentally fire victim's sister and friend developed relationships - one with brother from one of the missing girls cases and the other from coma victim's condo purchase. A lot going on but a lot of scattered stories which made things convoluted. Of course all three crimes plus more are resolved with a happy ending that I prefer. Just seemed like a dis-jointed read and not as developed as earlier books.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I have been too France beautiful there. This movie was excellent Acting was good Scenery beautiful People should watch this movie
B00B7VZN76|4.0|I've purchased all the Next Generation blu-ray sets so far and have yet to be disappointed.  I'll skip the review of the actual show; we all know that season 3 is when Next Gen really hit it's stride and became the show we love, so why rehash that?  The episodes look and sound fantastic, new details that you never noticed before, and there are several episodes that feature multiple commentary tracks.  All the previous DVD extras seem to be here, and the new content is (inter)stellar.<br /><br />First off one of the most anticipated features for me was the inclusion of the footage featuring little person David Rappaport in the episode &#34;The Most Toys&#34;.  The actor tried to commit suicide while filming the episode and was replaced by Saul Rubineck.  I was always curious about how the episode would have been, but frankly (with all respect for the dead) Saul's performance is simply better than Rappaport's, and it is very apparent in hindsight that David is having personal issues as his performance isn't at the top of his game.  Still it's great that is was included and is  very interesting to see.<br /><br />This season set was pushed as &#34;the writer's set&#34; with most of the new extras dealing with the show's incredible writing staff.  We get an hour long round table discussion with the writing staff hosted by Family Guy's Seth McFarlane.  I hope we see more of these s this was truly enjoyable.  It's a very informal talk about the season and it's just a treat filled with great trivia (they almost killed Will Riker off?!?!?!).  The other extras also go in depth into the season with the actors, with plenty of trivia, anecdotes and discussion.  A long gag reel is included again, and while I LOVE the fact that each season is getting a season specific gag reel this one is fairly light on the laughs and is not one of the better ones.  But just the fact that it's included is awesome.<br /><br />Ok, so why only 4 stars out of 5, you ask?  Very simple.  On the same day this set was released there was also another Next Generation release.  The Season 3 cliffhanger finale and it's Season 4 conclusion were released as a re-edited &#34;movie&#34; on a separate blu ray, &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation; The Best of Both Worlds&#34;.  This release has it's own set of extras, a gag reel from that episode, etc.  These extras go into detail on what is arguably one of the most well known episodes/cliffhangers EVER, and NONE of these features are included in the Season 3 blu-ray set, so if you want them you have to buy a totally separate blu-ray of an episode YOU NOW ALREADY HAVE to get the extra features.  This comes off as a pathetic cash-grab and I strongly hope that CBS rectifies this by including these features on the Season 4 set.  It may seem like not that big of a deal, but when I purchase the pricey box set of a season I already owned on DVD and it's not 'complete' I find that very irritating.  Oh well.<br /><br />That major issue aside, this is a great set overall, just remember that it is NOT complete.  ;-)

B008JFUPFI|5.0|Seventy five years ago this month, Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster brought The Man of Steel into the world through DC Comics. Today (appropriately) on Flag Day, the first, the best imagined superhero of all time has been reintroduced to the world by director Zack Snyder, writer David Goyer, producer Christopher Nolan and personified in the perfect embodiment of Henry Cavill. ...For those wary of long reviews, here's the condensed version: WOW!!<br /><br />Upon watching &#34;Captain America the First Avenger&#34; two years ago, I declared it to be the best superhero movie ever made. That sentiment remained a year later after watching &#34;The Avengers.&#34; No question it was FUN - magnificently made sheer escapist fantasy but it wasn't more than that. It lacked its predecessor's heart. Well, &#34;Man of Steel&#34; combines the nonstop action and state of the art special effects of The Avengers with the soul and spirit of The First Avenger (which Captain America borrowed from Superman). Here's how:<br /><br />- It doesn't pull any punches... Almost every aspect of this film is Academy Award worthy. While I agree that Christopher Nolan is a very competent and interesting film maker, I've always found his work muddled where the special effects take over the storytelling resulting in minimal depth and often confusing the story told. His talents were better served here in a hands off approach. I commend him for his decision to turn over creative control to Zack Snyder who clearly owns this film together with Cavill. These two men carried the initial premise of a one of a kind child born to an extraordinary couple from a race of extraordinary beings to its logical conclusion without ever flinching. There's one particular scene toward the end that made me cry like a baby for a good five minutes. It's a powerful scene in a film full of powerful scenes. I read a preliminary review a few days ago criticizing this film for lacking humanity. Now that I've seen it for myself, I couldn't disagree more. In that one scene, not only did I feel Superman's humanity but I think I understand now what it must be like for an American soldier when he/she takes up arms to defend all they love from those who promise to destroy it. The extraordinary price they pay for their patriotism and commitment is heartbreaking.<br /><br />- This film answers the question of which is the real man and which is the disguise... The truth is that there is no disguise. Kal-El, Clark Kent, Superman - they're all facets of the same man - all real in the context of different aspects of his life and experience. And for those who roll their eyes at the idea of a simple pair of glasses serving as a &#34;disguise&#34; ... you try it some time. You'd be surprised at how many people are willing to dismiss someone from extraordinary contention if they consistently keep themselves to behind the scenes work, don't behave in a flamboyant or even assertive manner, they don't announce everything they do and say and don't make themselves the story on social media or anywhere else. Yes. There are still people who value their privacy. Thankfully, as long as they don't show off anything that might be coveted by others, most people are very much willing to let them continue in anonymity.<br /><br />- Henry Cavill's performance is Perfect... I don't use this word lightly. Before today, George Reeves from the 1950's &#34;Adventures of Superman&#34; was my favorite Clark Kent and Christopher Reeve from the late 70's/80's movies was my favorite Superman. Cavill not only matches them in caliber but surpasses them in presence and personification. He is STRONG in every way. The love he oozes throughout the film makes him that much more powerful. With Snyder's guidance (similarly like Gerard Butler in &#34;300&#34;) he walks the fine line of being vulnerable without ever seeming corny or weak. Besides having Kirk Alyn's earnestness, George Reeves' intelligence, Christopher Reeve's strength, Dean Cain's charm, Brandon Routh's charisma and Tom Welling's delectable handsomeness, Henry Cavill brings passion to the role -something that was sorely lacking all these years. (Welling did exude passion in Smallville  season 9 but in season 10 he was only able to sustain passion in his scenes with Lois Lane.) Cavill seems to try hard but it's difficult to accept he'd ever fall in love with a version of Lois who is so unattractive. So, as I predicted after watching the final two minutes of &#34;Smallville&#34; two years ago, no couple will ever surpass the perfect combustible on screen chemistry of Tom Welling and his partner in their combined portrayal of Lois and Clark. Durance stated that she'll never again play Lois Lane without Welling in the lead and I suspect Welling has privately made the same decision. Their commitment to each other is admirable but it is a shame we'll never see Cavill's Clark with Durance's Lois. Honestly though, the ultimate dream team up would be Cavill and Phyllis Coates (from Adventures of Superman) who remains my favorite Lois Lane.<br /><br />I wasn't much of a fan of any of the supporting players before this. I particularly didn't care for Russell Crowe or Kevin Costner but by their second and third scenes, respectively, I actually forgot their previous work and accepted them as Superman's two fathers. Laurence Fishburne was really good as Perry White. I didn't mind the actress who played Ma Kent as much as I thought I might and all the Krypton and armed forces actors were excellent. Hans Zimmer music was inspired - it fit Cavill's portrayal. Surprisingly, I didn't miss John Williams' signature piece. And by the way, there are countless &#34;Easter eggs&#34; paying homage to previous Superman renditions. For example, one of the times Superman saves Lois, they land in a Kansas corn field - exactly where Lois first meets Kal-El in &#34;Smallville&#34; - only she was saving him in that version. Also, the way Jor-El and Lara launch their baby to Earth is very similar to &#34;Superman the Animated Series&#34; and the 1948 &#34;Superman&#34; theatrical serial.<br /><br />July 4, 2013 UPDATE: Saw this film again yesterday but in IMAX. It was really loud(!) but most everything else was as I remembered except ... This time I found myself annoyed by the actress who played Superman's Girl Friday ... she's almost as bad as the one in &#34;Superman Returns&#34; (but at least that one sort of looked the part after they put that long, dark, curly wig on her). Perhaps I didn't really pick up on it the first time because I was so focused on the main character but she was seriously miscast. Clark's partner needs to be his mortal female mirror image: tall, dark and beautiful with a temperament and physicality to match her traditional upbringing by a four star general to make her action scenes believable. Here, she just looked like a short, red-head little kid (with wrinkles) playing in her mom's high heels and holding a toy ray gun. She's a full nine years older than Cavill and looks it, too! Zack Snyder made a huge mistake when he hired her. It's too bad Snyder's taste in women has taken a nose dive much like Christopher Nolan's in the &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; trilogy. You'd think they're both now allergic to beautiful women! Regardless, I found myself inspired by Henry Cavill even more this second time around.<br /><br />For Henry Cavill in particular, Congratulations. ... And for The Man of Steel, himself ... Happy Birthday! Three quarters of a century and counting ... he still stands for Truth, Justice and the American Way. Thank God for it.ing's looks, Henry Cavill brings passion to the role -something that was sorely lacking all these years.

B005LAIH2M|1.0|I have never written a review or anything of the sort before . . . Ever . . . But I a m 20 minutes into this unfortunate movie and can honestly say it is absolutely one of the worst things anyone could possibly have come up with . . . Ever . . . Everyone involved with this movie, down to the craft services people, should have a one year ban on making movies so they have time to reflect on what it means to put trash into this world and maybe do a better job next time. Sure, some good people might have been involved in this, but that's a risk worth taking . . . There's plenty of good people out there who were not involved in this trash . . . The studio that put this movie out should be banned from future projects and instead they can start pedaling cigarrettes to kids as this is what this movie essentially comes down too. God help us all if this is the kind of trash that gets made in this day and age . . . God Help US ALL . . . If people out there over the age of 7 enjoyed ANYTHING this crap presented . . .

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Would rather give no stars but at least the release date was on time. Wow, I was speechless!  The author should refund everyone who bought it or passed it out for free. I returned it. Not a nice thing to do to all the readers who have waited this long for the last book of the trilogy or so I was led to understand, but that could be my mistake.  Spoiler alert!  The sex scenes were tedious and a filler for real writing and the ending wasn't even an ending, it was a buy another book.  At least tie up SOME loose ends.

Judge for yourself & don't listen to those ivory tower elites.<br /><br />The story has state of the art visuals & effects.  The story is strong starting at the beginning on Krypton, then goes on to reinterpret some of the 75yr infinitely layered super-mythology; a real plus to the viewers, perhaps expecting a simple rehash. NO SPOILERS.<br /><br />Cavill makes you believe in the hero...and has the bod to prove it.  Amy Adams (Lois Lane) is worlds away from appearing with teenage Clark Kent in [[ASIN:B00005JLKB Smallville: The Complete First Season]]S1, ep7 in 2001. [Fat teenager Jodi Melville is obsessed to lose weight, rejected by her schoolmates.

Jodi immediately achieves a wonderful shape, but has a huge and uncontrollable starvation and needs human body fat as the side effect, threatening whoever is closest to her.]<br /><br />If available near you, IMAX 3D is worth the extra $ upgrade.  Judge for yourself, don't follow old fuddy-duddies.  Man of Steel is terrific!<br /><br />UPDATE: Key to note all these reviews around mid-June are of the Theatrical Release...NOT the as-yet/unreleased Blu-Ray.  Don't know if they will have decent features, a great package of deleted scenes and quality 3D transfer; perhaps even a director's cut version suitable for home viewing as in the [[ASIN:B004HEWNBO Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy - Extended Edition (The Fellows...]]; one can only hope...<br /><br />Second, and important for some to be aware in advance.  Building collapses in latter part of the film may have a deja vu of 9/11.  It may be intense for anyone with a direct connect to NYC, the Pentagon, or the Pennsylvania site.  Don't think they would have so much of these events in the film if earlier than the 12-years since the attacks...  That said, time HAS passed, and it would be sad to think of never seeing really good buildings destruction in films again.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's basically a simulation game in which you care for a horse and compete with it in competitions. So, if you like that sort of stuff, your kind of app. I enjoy playing this game. Although I'm not sure if it needs a Wi-Fi Connection. I'd like it better if I did not have to pay for things. Overall, worth it.
B00447G2T8|5.0|Another great album. The music has everything a helloween fan (and any serious metal fan) could want, from huge grand melodies to lightning drumming done with amazing taste to beautiful vocals and great guitar work. I can't find a song to skip on this one, the whole record becomes an earworm after 3 days!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|For all the people whining and complaining about this not being as good as the studio album and all that I have just one thing to say: GO SEE THEM IN CONCERT! They are on tour right now this summer, just find a venue close to you and go freakin see them. I saw them last night in Albuquerque, NM and they absolutely KILLED! These guys are easily one of the best live bands out there today, every one of the 11 man/woman band is an extremely talented musician and they put on one hell of a show. Of course this album doesn't quite capture what it's like to see them live, but it does a pretty good job. So stop whining and just go see them. Your mind will be blown and you will not care as much about the polished studio stuff (still awesome) and you'll just wanna see them again!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first one I felt like this book had a hard time picking up. I would say it took about 8 chapters for me to realize this book is as good as the first. Catching fire adds a new dimension to the main characters that the first book didn't have. I give it five stars because this book has everything ...action, drama, romance and thriller like qualities. These books can be read by any type of reader and be enjoyed.

As was the tale, but life isn't all summer, but those who make it through a harsh frozen life, even with some missing toes, and can still laugh and hope, even better make it ours is beautiful. As is this story, as is Gillian Flynn. What's next?
B008K8H9C6|1.0|There is no explanation of how to play -- we're not all gamers  will delete from my kindle hd for sure
B0001MLMKY|5.0|I got this because i needed a watch while working in the hospital. its a cute watch and does exactly what it has to!<br /><br />i havent had any problems with it except nearly losing it every other day when i used to wear it all the time to the gym.
1423113454|4.0|As I mentioned in my review of book 2, I did't know it was a book for younger people.  But it is a good read, and I'm enjoying it. It's a great adventure for the younger crowd.
3833160454|5.0|Book is as described, arrived in timely manor and is good reading material with many photos and diagrams if one is interested in making shoes.
B0031BAQ5Y|5.0|What else to tell you, I love that movie!  Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt are superb, to name just two.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The game is fun and the storyline is engaging.  The graphics, sound, and game play are well thought out.  The negatives are that it's a hefty download on a phone as it requires 700+ MB in additional content.  Also, the game can get expensive if you want premium upgrades to buy gems.
B0064MPXFA|1.0|This is another one of those sleezy sexist series.  I do not read porn, I do not enjoy movies or anything else with this type story line.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I was completely blown away by this film.  I watched it on Netflix, but I will buy the Blu-Ray as soon as I have a TV suitable .... Worthy of viewing this a second time.  Can't speak highly enough of quality of this production.  My hat is off to the whole team!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The end was terrible, the story line was awful and was in general disappointed with this book. If it wasn't for my own curiosity, I wouldn't want to read the ext one. I found her writing to be unrealistic and at some points retarded.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Rollings characters and action keep this novel moving. I enjoyed reading it and can still picture the settings and action in my head, like a movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has an uncanny way of drawing his readers into his characters quickly and getting us emotionally involved with them from the moment we meet them.  He has a knack for creating characters that are touchingly human, beautiful and flawed at the same time. I assumed I would love this book as I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, and I assumed correctly.  If you are a fan of Kahled Hosseini and want to meet some truly human characters, this is a book you must read.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|first record in a few that he sounds refreshed and fired up. not that they all arent at least excellent this one has a little bit of extra something
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I wanted to see how Arnold was doing now days.  Lots of action and he played off the fact that he is getting older.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was one of my favorite books growing up so of course picked it. Wish it read to my son as a new age twist to an all time favorite but still love the story.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and gives the reader a new perspective into how to view life. I enjoy Albom's writing style and use of personal experiences in his books.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|The structure of the book is interesting, and it is a lot like Catch 22, except it didn't have as much substance to it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Misremembered Man is a heart touching tale of finding love & belonging. I laughed out loud in several places - cried in others. Prepare to be moved.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Mind blowing,but it always gos off line during the game.  But everything is too repetitious in the questions where it becomes too routine,
B000059T1E|4.0|I like Traffic.  Having the lyrics would be nice.  Having more Traffic would be nice.  Hopefully I'll get the lyrics next time.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This season is still good don't get me wrong but nothing compared to the first two. Fairly obvious they changed writers.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Soooooooo drawn out, and totally sleep producing. Will not hold the youngsters attention. Not much there.  Sorely disappointed, especially given the cast.  A real snoOZer. Maybe if it was edited from over 2 hours to one hour plus would help.
B004V9MU86|5.0|A friend told me this was the best book he had ever read! I purchased it on that recommendation...and can easily see why. An excellent story and brilliantly written.

B003R50AW8|5.0|The Messenger was an excellent read. It held me captive throughout. It was thoughtful and showed great understanding of humans and both their weaknesses and strengths, love and trust. As well as a very good story!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love games that challenge me and make me think. Each level gets a little more challenging and has me looking forward to the next level. I'm going to let my 7yr old play

B0082XJGRK|5.0|If you are a fan of stoicism or just philosophy in general you should read this. The philosophy isn't as harsh as say Nietzsche but you can appreciate how intelligent and observing Marcus is. Closest we ever became to having a philosopher king, too bad he was always pre-occupied with war.
B000669GAI|5.0|If you like Pearl Jam, buy this album now!! Has all there greatest hits and many other songs on two disc for a re-donk-u-lus price!!

B000051VWW|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY Love this cd, courtesy of AMAZON.COM.  SADE delivers an Oscar Type performance!!!  The Music is Tight, and her Unmistakable vocals make you FEEL Every Word She Said (yes, I'm aware that is the name of one of the cuts), but she Even Nailed the name of her tracks to how it would make you Pay Attention; while you're Enjoying her Perfect, Unmistakably Identifiable Voice delivering Soulful-Sensual-Passionate-Compelling-Unforgettable, and Inspiring Lyrics!!! I'd Naturally Recommend this to Every Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Student, Housewife, Obviously Everybody!!!  You'll miss out if you don't get this. I'm Glad I Did!!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Best game ever . You can do new hair styles every time.luv the colors and curlers and everything. It is so much better than the first and its is worth the money you have to buy it
B002KVCA1O|5.0|AMAZON.COM, You did it again.  I Love it because it is true to its title.  Me being a person who's tying to stock my music supply back up again (experienced theft), it's great to be able to purchase compilation cd's.  The Jammin began from song number one, and Doesn't Stop; only the cd does. lol I Recommend Everyone should buy it. The sound quality is Awesome, and so are the lyrics; not to leave out Micks Unmistakable Fun Invoking Voice!!!

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Much better than the previous movie.  Great action and good story.  J J Abrams knows how to make a movie.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I recently got into The Big Bang Theory on TV and decided that I wanted to watch it from the beginning. So I found a great deal here on Amazon and decided to get it.  It got here so fast that I was surprised when it showed up in my mail box!  I loved it overall and made me love the show even more.  The only problem I had with it (and it could have been something to do with my TV since its not one of the top of the line TV's or the newest thing in the world...probably about 5 or 4 years old) was when I played the blu ray disc the first episode was so horribly grainy that I couldn't even stand to watch more than the first couple of minutes and didn't even dare try and watch the other ones in Blu-ray format. But otherwise I was very happy with the purchase since it also came in DVD and the DVD format wasn't nearly as grainy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is great! I love the variety of picture packs available.  There are plenty of free ones as well as ones to pay for. I use this app on my Kindle Fire and the pictures pop!!! Love the Hallucinations pack!
0525953728|5.0|What a privilege and an honor to be given a glimpse into the life of a SEAL. I couldn't put the book down. By military standards the book was very bland, but from the perspective of someone who may never meet a SEAL, it was riveting. Given the vagueness, I doubt seriously the author is being ostracized by former co-workers. I can see why The Messiah's fragile ego would be bruised. Obviously given recent events, if you don't march in lockstep with his thinking you will feel his wrath. Ask the families of the 31 military elite who were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan in August of '11 who has jeopardized the privacy/security of their lost ones more. Obama has not only given away the store, but handed over our military to our enemy on a silver platter.<br /><br />The author's attention to detail made me feel like I was watching a movie in my head.<br /><br />The \\"Good Idea Fairy\\" in Abbottabad made me laugh until I cried! The government in general is the Good Idea Fairy and we have to live with its decisions every day. I was expecting a sterile book, but the humor had me laughing a few times.<br /><br />I wonder if the SEAL's best days are behind them with all the new policy changes. Perhaps we should be recruiting police officers and psychologists instead for the war. The author was a SEAL at the BEST time!<br /><br />Just like Vietnam, this war is political. Vietnam could have ended within a few weeks. But sadly, when politicians run a war instead of the BRILLIANT minds of the military, you get higher than necessary casualties. Reading about the changes made me absolutely sick to my stomach. My heart aches for what our military is expected to endure.<br /><br />I was very happy the author gave an update to a former co-worker at the end.<br /><br />I am disappointed the author doesn't see that he defied death not because of luck, but because God was protecting him.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book and hated to see it end.<br /><br />Thank you Mark Owens for writing your book!
B0041G4POG|5.0|I run about 50 miles a week. Often after long runs my legs just *ache*. I've tried ice baths, which really help. But often that wears off after 5-6 hours. Of course I could do another one. But jumping into an ice bath when you're already hot and sweaty feels a lot different from doing it when you're sitting around cool and relaxed at the end of the day. So I read an ultrarunner's review on these I decided to give them a try. They happened to arrive on a day when mu legs were really achy after a half marathon run in the morning. Put them on and it took away 75% of the ache. Like night and day. And very comfortable under a pair of jeans too -- wore them around the whole evening. Really comfortable and comforting. If you do mileage and need to speed your recovery, don't hesitate, these really work!
1592407889|4.0|When you read this book, the events of Sachi Parker's life will make you really appreciate being normal.  What an uncommon life she had and what a long trail to self acceptance and success, courtesy of her unconventional life and family.<br /><br />I've read several of Shirley MacLaine's books, seen a lot of her movies, and have seen her perform a one-woman show, always admiring her confidence, personality, and talent.  But I would have to say that none of those things matter in the face of her role as a mother, and that's where she really, really disappoints.  Shirley MacLaine is a quack, a self-centered goof, and a failure.  She can have the fame, but what she did as a parent is unforgivable.<br /><br />I'm glad Sachi Parker told her story.  It seems genuine, and it must feel like redemption for some of the things in life she had to endure.  I enjoyed reading the book.  If you're someone whose lucky enough to have a really nice mom, you'll feel good.  And if you're someone who has a mom who isn't really nice, you'll know you aren't alone.  And this mom takes the cake!
1573229725|3.0|I understand that Sarah Waters, the author, is quite young. Hopefully her plot developments will become more nuanced with time. Certainly, she's a very gifted writer. Her descriptions of city and country life in old England, from the seamiest alleys to the finest houses, were evocative and instructive. The plotline was a cliffhanger--that is, until the protagonist managed to seduce high-born Maud and lure her into a devilish trap designed to defraud her of an inheritance. The love and affection that grew between Sue (transplanted from the slums of London as a bogus maid) and Maud, the 16-year-old heiress, was touchingly believable. Sue's growing reluctance to collaborate with the evil \\"Gentleman\\" in the seduction of Maude was convincing. Then came the betrayal. Surprise! The betrayal of Sue! Now it's Maud who turns evil.<br /><br />Waters did too good a job convincing me of the veracity of Maud's and Sue's characters as drawn in the first third of the book for me to buy this startling plot twist. It was totally unbelievable. I know, I know. It's fiction. It never happened. But when fiction is really good, the reader can almost believe that it did. I had the feeling that the author was playing with her readers' minds in a way that's not quite cricket. So I closed the book. Reluctantly, I'll admit. But I have an old button that causes the hackles on my back to rise when I'm toyed with.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Its a must have!!! I got the trial and I absolutely loved it! I had to get the full version!

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Great movie. Didn't like it first time I watched it, but it grew on me. Sam Worthington's best movie probably.
B00C7L8DM2|2.0|Although the premise had some promise, it was boring and it seemed like the only actor putting in any real effort was the daughter

1432794426|5.0|This book is wonderfully written to show Michael's true character, his loving and humble ways, that show him for the person he was. This book gives some insight and organizes some of the major aspects of the later years of Michael's life that gives the reader a insight on what it was like to be him. The book is written with great respect and love for Michael. This book truly will help anyone see Michael in the true sense of who he was, it vindicates him.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I do enjoy this game It doesn't take any real thought so it gives a short relief to today problems

1476733953|5.0|Hugh Howey is a wordsmith, a master of his craft.  Creating a bleak future in a dystopian world where humanity never sees the light of day and society is based on webs of lies should not be able to be told with such poetry.  Howey has an insight into how we perceive the world that enables him to describe a world, and it's people, in such a way that it all feels real and possible.  He shapes people with his words, one after another, adding detail, quirks and fictional souls until there is an entire clan of people you can imagine living in another place and time.  Each person then has a life, and a unique perspective...all layering together for this Story, making it like a living thing you can't quite imagine ending.  Thankfully, it appears that Howey has the ability to continue the story without losing his way, or his genius.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Levels up quickly early on, gradually takes more time. I like that I can make progress on goals in just a few minutes; lets me play here and there when I have a few minutes to kill.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|A zombie movie without that much gore, enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone who like to watch zombie movies.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|BEAUTIFULLY PRODUCED AND ACTED. SHE AND THE ENTIRE STORY WAS PRESENTED IN THE MOST BELIEVABLE FASHION. I HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE AND ENJOYED BOTH VIEWINGS.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this book mostly because I found the characters to be very believable.  Being a sports fan I really liked the Eagles fan aspect even though I'm not that crazed about the teams I cheer for.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|THE SECOND SEASON WAS AS WELL PRODUCED AS THE FIRST. IN THE FIRST I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING PAST THE LEAD ACTOR, BUT HE SOON BECAME PART OF THE TAPESTRY AND WAS VERY WELL ACCEPTED.
B00821OX98|5.0|good to watch if you are looking for a thing to watch. if you dont watch it you probably don't like it or know about it.

0061928356|4.0|She develops her characters VERY well.  Enjoyed it. Would recommend it for summer reading to anyone.<br />Too many words are required.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is just what I needed for a light, easy beach read. Likeable characters, humorous situations and dialogue, sexual situations that aren't too explicit, and a HEA. Is it the next great American Novel? No, but it was worth reading and I would read more by this author.<br />*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.
3836538725|5.0|Salgado's images are very moving and the book is printed extremely well. This is a must have book if you are a collector of great photography books.

0525478817|5.0|I seldom write reviews, but I just HAD to recommend this book.  We just finished reading it for book club, and everyone loved it.  It is the best book we have read.  It is the best book I have read in a very long time.  I liked it so well that I bought all of Green's other books and read them immediately.  Ahhhhh!  Now what will I read?  Good stuff.  I wish I could write something 1% that good.  I just can't stop thinking about the characters.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|For the price, this is a fantastic game to play.  Want to kill sometime and exercise your brain? The fire up this game. I have had no problems with this app.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I saw this in a flight a couple weeks ago, and was debating shutting it off several times as it was so BORING.....Yeesh! Although I was stuck on a flight for 6 hours at some points in the movie, I was contemplating if turning this off and staring at the man's bald spot in the seat in front of me as it seems like  a better option....<br />This movie is not just bad...it is INCREDIBLY INSIPID with dreadful acting by James Franco and Michelle Williams...Mila Kunis had her moments but it could not save this flop!
0307271080|5.0|I neede it to look at Adichie's style of writing and I got it after reading just a few pages. I had to stop because I did want what I saw to deviate me from my own style. Impressive though.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|FUN GAME--good for the brain. Goes quickly and is not too hard.<br />Interesting symbols and lovely back grounds. Sound is OK but I<br />prefer silence!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Cain provides insight about the world of introverts in a non- apologetic and refreshing way. I have a better understanding of why I love conferences and business lunches, but often come home with minimal interest in phone conversations or even idle chat with my spouse. Similarly, the advice on caring for and validating introverted children is invaluable for parents and educators alike.

B005LAIHRC|5.0|Absolutely love love love this movie.  Makes me miss the 80's .  We knew how to Rock in the 80's.  Tom Cruise is a suprise as Stacee Jaxx he has an incredible \\"Rock God \\" voice.

B002QGUFWE|3.0|The songs were not played as fast as they are on the radio.  The quality of the CD was ok, but it just didn't seem quite right, and not having the music play as fast as normal was a let down.
B00000IREA|5.0|This is one of the most classic and cheesyest Sci-Fi movies of all time! And who'd imagine these days that Jane Fonda was that beautiful back in the day! I enjoy the movie's effects the most though. ;)

B00002EPJH|5.0|I really enjoy the blend of muswic and the melody. It is soothing and rich in tone. There is no harshness or agression in the music and it is wonderful to listen to after a long hard day
B008FPOIT6|5.0|After reading the reviews I decided to take a chance on this one.  People either loved it or hated it. What I liked was that the book was a great running joke about the power go Google.  In the valley we have heard mush about Google.  I think that the author took a tongue in cheek approach to google.  By bringing all of the power of &#34;the Cube and googled employees to answer the ultimate question we find that not even google can determine if there is a God.  The author did a great job of developing the story line and characters.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I wish that there was more devotions for youth. Also I wish that I could change the voice of the reader (sorry to be Johny rain cloud) now over all it's ok.

B004LPLU4K|4.0|Nice Saturday afternoon movie. Kind of looks like there were other movies done later similar to this one's plot. Bye
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This album is cohesive, emotional, sensitive, and riveting. Did I originally hope for a \\"longer\\" or \\"heavier\\" record after 6 years of waiting? Yes, but I wouldn't trade this album for anything else. The band have created a very inspired album and all of the meticulous work they put into their craft is palpable. Stand out tracks are I Appear Missing, I Sat by the Ocean, and Like Clockwork. There's not a weak point on this album, but if I was forced at gunpoint to choose, it would be If I Had a Tail, a raunchy dance song that doesn't really go anywhere, but it's part of the album and couldn't be anything else. Earlier interviews with Homme have quoted him saying things such as; touring the first album really influenced his writing, he doesn't have anything to prove so he's going to play for the people who like their sound and he's going to play right at them, and \\"THE ROBOTS ARE BACK.\\" This album does NOT sound like that album, and I'm intrigued to know if there may be a wealth of unreleased \\"traditional\\" Queens tracks from when they were in the studio in 2011. Before Homme decided he just might have something important to say, and then proceeded to shatter all our expectations with ...Like Clockwork. Food for thought. Either way, this is the best album of the last few years at least, and I already can't wait for more.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is another amazing story written by this wonderful author.  I did not want the book to ever end, it holds your interest through every page.  This author brings you right into the story and you feel as if you know the people in each situation.  Loved this book and can't wait for another one.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Great story and humble, yet valiant hero.  It helped my boys understand that there are many things worth fighting for and some worth dying for.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book reads more like a prophecy then sci fi. The characters were rich, the story compelling, the finish provocative and original.
B003D8KH9A|4.0|The picture makes this look much sturdier than it is.  It's quite flimsy and I find the whole rope thing awkward.  It seems to me that for the price there should be a better design and better quality material.  But having said that,  I gave it 4 stars because it fit the 120&#34; pool perfectly (I did try other alternatives), it warms the water, keeps the bugs out and didn't rip immediately -- only time will tell if it's durable.  It just shouldn't cost what it does, but there doesn't seem to be anything else out there.

1401900526|5.0|Once again, a quality product by acclaimed Louise Hay. I have been following her since the 80's and own much of her items to include mostly her books. She really knows how to help anyone suffering from lack of confidence or person's who just needs guidance on their journey in life. I am very pleased with these lovely cards and the box they come in is sturdy too. Small enough to travel with or sit on your nightstand. Anywhere you need them they wont take up too much space and will draw attention should a guest come to your home. I love sharing these or anything else offered by Louise Hay. Her affirmations are uplifting and never fail to help my emotionally. I always feel better after I read them daily and they help me to change my mindset. A+++
B009M588K8|2.0|The entire &#34;episode&#34; of killing this evil man has gripped the world since it took place. So I was thrilled to read that one of the US SEALS that did the job, had written a book - &#34;helped&#34; I'm sure, by a &#34;Ghost writer.&#34; Even with (I assume) the help of a professional journalist, the book is - and let us be kind here &#34;Slow reading&#34; that's boring and pedestrian. It reads like a &#34;How to Write A Fact Based Story&#34; 101 lesson. A far better, much more interesting book, is the one by Peter Bergen called MAN HUNT. But then he is a professional journalist, and knows how to put words together in a really riveting way. I applaud the good intentions of &#34;Mark&#34; to write this book, but I feel he should stick to doing what he - and other SEALS - do so well, and so brilliantly - that is getting rid of the bad guys. You and your team mates did a superb job there, and the world, and especially Americans, will forever be grateful for what you all achieved. Bravo!

0891419195|5.0|As a travel journalist and lifetime military aficionado, this book is so truthful and so totally honest about the horrors and mind numbing brutality of real combat and real war, it makes you wonder how any human being could endure such depravity, and still remain even half normal. All of this hideous and beyond words &#34;fields of slaughter&#34; is endured by mostly 18, 19 and 20 year old kids. EB Sledge said he only had &#34;one book&#34; in him. Well if you truly want to know, up close and more personal than you ever thought possible, what REAL combat is REALLY like, read this memorable, stunning, awesome book. Apart from anything else, it'll make you wish and pray that mankind might (?) be able to find a way to eliminate war from the world. But I doubt it. This is a military classic that should, indeed MUST, be read by anyone who still thinks war is the answer to solving &#34;problems.&#34; It is genius war writing at its best. Get it at Amazon today!

B00B0C6T34|5.0|Swing Out Sister has just passed their 25th year together and PRIVATE VIEW, their first studio album since 2008's BEAUTIFUL MESS is a sampler of some of their classic songs redone with more of a jazz based explorative styling.  Lead vocalist Corrine Drewery and Andy Connell are the only two remaining from the original group and here they are backed with an amazing quintet for what can only be called musical magic.  Corrine has never sounded better and each track, be it NOTGONNACHANGE, INCOMPLETE WITHOUT YOU or MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO FOOL are performed in innovative stylings far superior to the originals.  LA LA MEANS I LOVE YOU is mezmerizing and BREAKOUT is a tour de force performed here as a midtempo ballad!  This whole set is indeed a true gift to their fans.  It respects the music they have made and respects the fans not just giving them the same songs rehashed  but rather reinterpreted in ways that bring new life and stylings to each track.  For me AM I THE SAME GIRL is the best track.  So Swing Out Sister fans, for you this is a must have but I also must recommend it to all fans of jazz music.  It gets no better than this.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The music scene needs more artists like this; artists who aren't afraid to do something that's already been done but make it good enough so that it's worth listening.  Actually the Lumineers use such old styles that this kinda thing is basically brand new again.  If I had a Best New Artist award to hand out for 2012, it would go to The Lumineers.  They're more of a folk group, but their Americana style is quite charming and they'd make a perfect opening band for Mumford & Sons.  This self-titled debut album had a pretty big hit with the catchy \\"Ho Hey,\\" but the rest of the album will have a harder time fitting in on modern radio.  \\"Stubborn Love\\" and \\"Charlie Boy\\" are beautiful ballads that will transport you to sometime in the early 1900′s.  \\"Classy Girls\\" and \\"Submarines\\" are a bit more fun, the kind of songs a bunch of friends could sing along with at a pub.  \\"Flowers In Your Hair\\" has an almost Bob Dylan style to it (I just wish it were longer), and \\"Flapper Girl\\" is a simply ditty that sounds like it was made for the 1920s.  Again, this album isn't filled with formulas for radio success (like \\"Ho Hey\\"), but fans of folk music, or music in general, will really appreciate this.  This album is short n' sweet, and while some songs are better than others, it shows a lot of promise and I'll be keeping my eyes on this band.  If I had one solid complaint about this album it's that it needs more songs.
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|I am a huge Jamie Cullum fan and his work thus far, mainly jazz influenced has been legendary and magical in my opinion.  He is a true unique talent which is rare today.  On his sixth studio album MOMENTUM he writes all but 2 of the tracks and ventures into the world of pop and modern music.  By the reviews here this venture seems to be either received by love or hate and not much middle ground.  For me it an artist showing another side of their musical expression.  He is in no way selling out.  The songs are still performed with his amazing vocals front and center as he plays the piano.  And don't let the loose use of the term \\"pop music\\" in any way take away from the quality of these songs.  The opening THE SAME THINGS is strong, expressive and sets the listener up for what is to come.  EVERYTHING YOU DIDN'T DO is a great uptempo track.  EDGE OF SOMETHING and WHEN I GET FAMOUS are excellent tracks that showcase his reason for doing this.  There are meaning to the tracks and his vocal performance has never been better.<br /><br />His jazz stylings still permeate some of the tracks and he tackles two standards to huge success.  Cole Porter's LOVE FOR SALE is done here with excellent support from rapper Roots Manuva.  Hugely successful.  And Jamie's take on PURE IMAGINATION is the standout of the entire set.  It is Jamie Cullum at his purest, most melodic and rawest form.  For me it is the best track he has ever done.  I fully respect Jamie Cullum taking an artistic chance with this latest release.  I loved it all from the first listen.  No song is a miss.  I hope those who are disappointed give the cd more of a chance and give it a couple more listens.  Granted the musical stylings are for the most part different than in the past but Jamie still remains an eclectic, artistic musical visionary.  I found SAD SAD WORLD to be the best of his self penned tracks and strongly recommend this cd. Be prepare to follow a great talent as he takes some artistic chances and finds success.success.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|The reunion of Soundgarden is one that we always hoped for and never thought we'd get.  Perhaps they gave into the pressure from all the other bands doing it (Alice In Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Bush, ect.)  Now that Audioslave (Chris Cornell's other band) came to an end a few years ago, this reunion is a real blessing.  The group released their first newly recorded song in 15 years called Live To Rise which was featured on the soundtrack to \\"The Avengers.\\"  It was a decent tune, but it sounded more like a Chris Cornell solo jam than it did a Soundgarden song.  However, fans can rest easy, because King Animal is much more like the band we said goodbye to all those years ago.  In fact, this album is surprisingly similar in sound to the group's last album; Down On The Upside.  I was a bit shocked with the style on the first single; Been Away Too Long.  It sounds similar to some of those fast-paced jams like Ty Cobb, but it doesn't exactly have Number One Hit written all over it.  I dig the song though.  Kim Thayil's presence can definitely be heard in the lead guitar parts on several songs like A Thousand Days Before.  I think my favorite songs are By Crooked Steps for its hooks, and Bones of Birds for being kind of odd and creepy.  Things close out with a groovy, mellow tune called Rowing.  The album doesn't really have much trippy psychedelic songs (like Black Hole Sun), but more of a straight forward rock sound with slightly complex rhythms and arrangements.  Again, Down On The Upside is a decent basis of comparison.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This edition is good and all, but more current updates would be nice. Stuff like enchantment tables and Anvils would be nice, but hey, it's good so far. Remakes of this are effortless. Nothing is as good as the original.

B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|So most of the negativity is about the blue ray vs DVD, maybe that negativity should go somewhere else. As a movie this was phenomenal. It was every bit as Disney magic as they come. I mean I feel for you sad 2d-3d-blue ray-DVD unhappy people, but it really does cause a false flag having your comments with the movie reviews. People LOVE the actual movie. Even you say so. Is there some way Amazon can separate they \\"types\\" of comments from \\"Movie Review\\" , \\"Purchase Process\\", and \\"Purchase Delivery\\"? We can only hope...

1451613512|5.0|Firstly Im Australian, born in the UK, and my father and mother both fought in WW2 and my uncle was killed as a pilot . Why is this relevant, you may ask.<br /><br />From my visits to europe, Asia and the US through 30 years of work and growing up in the post WW2 era, through the cold war and vietnam, I always had suspicions something didn't add up. When travelling with Americans in Europe, they stuck together, tended to look for MacDonalds( and im not generalizing, this happened many times rather than embracing the different culture), when I visited America I was struck by how little even very senior managers knew about the rest of the world, and when I had American bosses in Australia, they had a \\"cut-throat approach\\" to HR.<br /><br />I wonder if this insular view of the world leads to many of the issues raised in this book. I would have liked that explored more ( one of the minor faults) also the approach to WW2 is a little simplistic. Claiming Stalin and the Russians won the war in the west overlooks a number of factors.<br />1/ To win, you first must not lose and the British/ Commonwealth won the Battle of Britian and the battle of the Atlantic ( with the US help)<br />2/ The above allowed the russians to be supplied and the Luftwaffe was a shell of its former self.<br />3/ The UK and US bomber command destroyed germany's ability to supply its forces with the advanced weaponry it needed to defeat the russians. Russia never participated in an air war over germany.<br /><br />Yes Russia defeated the german army but the UK and USA defeated the germans in the air and sea.<br /><br />I dont think we will ever know whether the bomb needed to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , a different time with different attitudes and already whole cities had been destroyed in germany, Poland, Russia and Japan with English cities feeling it through the blitz, etc.<br />What is eveident is that in no time in History has a US city been bombed to give perspective to the suffering<br /><br />Other than the above minor \\"gripes\\" I found the book absolutely compelling and importantly each painful point is well supported by fact ( not opinion like people who have scored this book lowly).<br /><br />One last point that was recorded just today in Australian news is the death toll from gun crime in the USA since that school killings 6 months ago has exceeded all the US military deaths in IRAQ. At the same time you still dont have a medicare system.<br /><br />I think there are fundamental social problems internal as well as external foreign policy and maybe that could be explored more, unsavoury as it is.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The book is magnificently written: the characters are so very real and<br />touching. Towards the end I felt there were too many stories and some<br />seemed irrelevant and certainly too long.<br />Having said that, I hope that Khaled Housseini is working on his fourth book!

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I enjoy authors who &#34;bend&#34; the rules.  Ms. Shaffter and Ms.Barrows do just that.  It's fascinating how they use correspondence to convey a story and flesh out characters. I so enjoyed looking at things through the eyes of Guernsy's inhabitants.  I mostly laughed at the way life was portrayed, but then I had tears when they talked of the war and how awful their lives were during those years.  It was uplifting to know there were brave souls out there helping fellow islanders at their own peril.  This book is such a good read, I highly recommend it to everyone of every interest.

B0097AQEOK|2.0|If anyone is thinking about purchasing this box set because they already own the phenomenal Joni Mitchell album 'Blue', then you might want to read this review.<br /><br />I bought 'Blue' a couple of years ago and it immediately made it into my all-time top 10 albums. There is no doubt that 'Blue' is folkish, pioneering, mostly acoustic, masterful, enlightening, and fun, however the rest of Joni Mitchell's work (judging by all the albums in this set except 'Blue') are strange, poorly written, and will probably be beyond the reach of anyone except for those people that are way out on the fringes of the art world. Just about every song I've sampled from this set (with anything on 'Blue' excluded) reeks of an all-encompassing effort to be different and artful; Joni sounds like she tried too hard to be abnormal. If I had to review 90% of the material in this box set in a single word I would summarize it as 'experimental'.<br /><br />Sure, all bands experiment. Experimentation is what pushes the envelope and brings new sounds into the musical world. Joni, on the other hand, seemed to have chosen to experiment in most of her work while minimizing the material most people can understand.<br /><br />I would advise most people to just buy 'Blue' and her greatest hits albums, or you might be left trying to like something because you just spent $40 on it.
B004XISI4A|2.0|What a shame<br />Too many twists and turns in a random and confusing story<br />Too many characters. Too many McGuffins.<br />Not in the same class as earlier books in the series<br />Have you ever read books where you can't wait to turn the page not because you can't wait to find out what happens next but to get to the end to put you out of your misery. This is one of them.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|great way to kill time and keep your mind sharp. i would suggest starting at the harder levels though. some music to accompany the levels would make it less mundane, the sound fx is nice but having continuous music would be nice.
1490313370|5.0|I bought this book because a budding entrepreneur friend recommended it on Facebook and I figured she was doing something right so I should at least give it a shot. I appreciated the money back guarantee because I knew that meant the author was standing behind his work. I am at a current crossroads in my life (saving up capital to start my own business) and this book really helped give me that extra little push to sit down and diagram who I should be networking with and how. I will be totally honest here at first I really wanted to put it down because the phrase \\"choose yourself\\" was used a couple more times than I would have liked in the beginning pages and the author claimed to solve the Wall St crisis (in jest) but I'm glad I continued on. I love reading self help, business, and nutrition subject matter based books and this was kind of a nice little all in one of the three. Altucher can be a bit cheesy at times with his analogies and choice of language but never overly gimmicky and you know what? It makes him seem just that much more accessible. One of the highlights of reading the book for me the success stories he shares of Sara Blakely and Alex Day. I have never read his blog before but now I will definitely have to check it out.  I am also committing myself to reading more frequently and TRYING to establish a more regular sleep schedule and fitness routine because I believe those things will make a positive difference in my wellbeing and my outlook. As someone who works from home, unfortunately it is very hard to have structure and right now I am just all over the place. $5 well spent, would have happily shelled out $15.<br /><br />Side note: I have been a perfectionist for as long as I remember and because of this have a lot of self doubt and procrastinating when it comes to moving forward. I now understand that it's perfectly okay to be mediocre. Not all of us are going to be Steve Jobs, nor should we strive to be. Such a simple concept but amazingly overlooked my entire life. Thank you James!
0140282033|5.0|Chocolat is a masterpiece of a novel. The characters are fantastic, and their lives are brilliantly woven together into an enchanting story. The voice of the main character is distinct and consistent, which gives her a kind of permanence in my mind that other characters haven't been able to gain. This is definitely a book I never wanted to end.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|I was intruduced to the series by my coworker. I put aside watching it because at the time, I did not feel like seeing it. But after being a little bit confused trying to follow who is who watching the first episode and seing the end of the first episode, I got hooked and decided to follow what would happen. Its been 3 seasons now and I'm happy to say that this is a great series to follow. The adaptation made me bought the book (digital edition). Since it takes 1yr every season, I will be reading the book and stop to where the last season ended. I'm a slow reader anyway.<br /><br />The map/tree line of characters that came with the dvd was great reference to help you follow who is who.

1439190275|4.0|The Atkins program has changed over the years as new scientific information has been learned.  As a result, this is not the Atkins program of 40 years ago, and thank goodness.  Who wants a written in stone program that doesn't learn anything as it goes?  This book is an example of how Atkins has adapted into it's most recent incarnation.  The book told me what I needed to know to work the program and the inspiration to do so.  I am, for instance, eating more veggies than I used to eat.  Yes, you eat veggies on Atkins now.  (Or don't.  I don't think the NSA is policing Atkins yet.)  And yes, they encourage exercise.  Sorry.  However I will mention that I have been unable to exercise because of a foot problem, so my results are without exercise (so far).<br /><br />I think the authors play fast and loose with the science.  They might criticize one study as not being scientifically valid or fair in it's analysis of Atkins, while at the same time using questionable studies to back up their own claims.  But if I've learned one thing in over half a century, it is that whatever the doctors tell us this year, they'll tell us the opposite in five, or twenty.  Everyone cherry picks the studies that support their own pet theories.  So I've decided to learn the best I can, choose the best I can, and do the best I can.  I'll be right about some of it.  I'll be wrong about some of it.  That's life.  I do not know The Truth About Everything, and neither do The True Believers -- and the louder someone screams about being right, the more skepticism you should have.  Including Atkins.<br /><br />I have looked at numerous different plans and tried dozens.  And gained it all back, because I couldn't live on those programs.  This time I researched and said hmmm, bacon and eggs, meat, fish, cheese, butter, cream.  My favorite foods.  I can give up sugar, but I'm not giving up eggs.  I like fats, I like meat, and Atkins seems the best fit for my life.  In the 5 weeks I've been on it, I'vebrought my blood glucose to normal, as well as my blood pressure, and I've improved my triglycerides.  Additionally, I've lost 14 lbs, but that should be one's least concern on an eating plan.  Health, it's all about health, and mine is better.  Well, health and hip to waist ratio, but not weight.<br /><br />So there you are.  Six weeks for me, success by every measurement I value, and satisfaction.  Not hungry, no mood swings brought on by blood sugar swings.  I'm not a doctor or dietitian, so I won't doubt there with be numerous scientists telling me I'm wrong.  Eh.  Tell it to the lab work.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Played the free game but it didn't last very long. I will have to purchase the game in order to finish it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is freaking amazing I love this game I can play it for hours worth 99 cents BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading Bared to You, the Crossfire series became one of my favorites.  I've read several books by Ms. Day and I'm a fan of her writing.  Unfortunately, with each release date delay my expectations got a little higher and I was very disappointed in the plot.  Toward the end it was like she threw in several sub plots to extend the series in what was supposed to initially be a trilogy.  I do hope that Gideon & Eva, along with Ms. Day's fans get their happily ever after but my journey with them ends here.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I enjoyed these short stories on my Kindle. The price was good,  but I would not purchase this set of stories in paperback. They were perfect as a 'fill-in' until I got used to my Kindle purchasing and reading. Plus, I enjoy the regular Bosch books, in any form. I kept looking for more of the story as I finished each one. They were like a  &#34;Bosch snack&#34;.
B00D6M86RS|1.0|This app won't install, it is probably for a Kindle Fire HD. Amazon please fix this recommendation for Kindle Fire,  it won't install.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|An educational book for those ignorant of what goes on in North Korea.  Disturbing t ok know how little we know and how little we do to help.
B002VX3RCW|3.0|I like it but dust and small particles tend to stick to the knight part of the toy. Wouldn't but again.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A must read for anyone in business. Steve Jobs was a visionary leader of a class very few can touch. He changed everything and its clear from reading this well written, readable narrative how and why. Steve Jobs took a highly unconventional path he decided on by exceptional insight and reasoning. As detail in his devices was thought through so was his meandering path.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A good read, but it doesn't keep your attention very well. This is a record of events. So nothing is really happening, because it's already over. I still liked it, but I didn't love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a great continuation of the first game.  This takes place in the air instead of on the ground. One huge monkey chases you, and you get to go on a cart underground if you run for a long time.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A book that you can picture from page one. Two characters that are opposite but that you like them both. A book everyone should read.
0786852550|4.0|I have to say, if you are reading the Bartimaeous trilogy, I recommend reading it at night before bed with only the night lamp on. It gave me a true sense of wonder and made me feel like I was actually in a dark setting from the book with the characters. The cover is simple yet awesome. I really love it when a good book has a cool cover so that I can show off even more when people ask me about what I'm reading. It's your standard fantasy with fantastic creatures, wizards, magic and such, but the plot is actually rather fascinating. I didn't find the fact that wizards are the villains and a demon is a hero interesting as much as the mere existence of people who control evil, lean, deliciously charming demons. The main characters differ very much in my eyes. I find Nathaniel a bit (maybe too) bland and lacking in character. I know he's supposed to be strong, but he looks too much of a wimp in my eyes and the fact that Bart is doing all his dirty work for him doesn't help. I didn't like him and sighed every time I got to his perspectives. Bart, on the other hand is now residing on my \\"Super hot and epic characters that I wish to marry\\" list. He is not only badass (not to mention charming, smarter than anyone else in the book in my opinion), but also the kind of guy/demon I would daydream about when I get moody. Seriously, this character is like a deity to me. I absolutely love this character. If he has a love interest somewhere in the other books, I think I'll make a voodoo doll of her and burn it or drown it in boiling oil sine I don't have any acid in my kitchen. When some other characters in other book I've read are just stupid, perfect Disney princes. This is actually a very good thing because then I don't feel so disgustingly jealous and hate filled when he has a love interest. Because Bart is now a permanent addition to my fantasies, I feel like it's a bad thing because I end up hating anyone who opposes him or he becomes attracted to. Those people might actually be nice and pretty good characters, but I will hate them just because I love Bart so much. For example, Kitty, a leader of some street gang (I think) opposed him and now I hate her. She seems like she could have a pretty neat backstory and I believe will be Nathaniel's love interest, but nobody disses Bart. It's like the 11th commandment now! I do not look forward to this character in the other books. The villain was actually pretty cool and the last battle was quite thrilling. Lovelace is an epic name, period. He is a sophisticated gentleman and I like that about him. Even though I wish he could have had a more creative goal to achieve which wouldn't include plotting against the government, but he's still a pretty amusing villain. The plot is original (with a few very minor setbacks). I just didn't like the resistance being named... Well, the Resistance. I wish they could have had a cooler name. Overall, the book is an exciting adventure filled with suspense and dark settings that give you a magical sense of wonder and chills at the same time. Not to mention, it has an epic, demon protagonist. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy book to read before bed. I loved the part when Bart ran over people with an ambulance and threw them in after doing so. Hilarious.be nice and pretty good characters, but I will hate them just because I love Bart so much.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought it  was gripping from page one. Lovely story, made me cry in the end. I surely recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i't is so fun my favorit game is Sush all you have too do is grab the stick and try to get them
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easy to read, and could not put it down. Really enjoyed every page. A romantic story that makes you believe.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I Like this clock on my kindel, because I can set the alarm, when I am away from home.  Also the clock keeps the time.<br />This alarm clock, is very good.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I bought this watch for my stepfather. He really liked it. In fact, it looked so good up close, I was strongly considering keeping it for myself lol. I may purchase another one
B004GYY714|5.0|I love the fact, that I can turn on the radio, listen to smooth Jazz 24'7 on JAZZRADIO.COM.,<br />You can listen to all Blues, Classical,Country and Hip Hop.  You can also listen to music, and play a game at the same time. I Love this app.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Most of the songs are really good.  There are a couple that sound a little too &#34;twangy country&#34; for my taste, but I just left them out of my itunes and problem solved.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I love movies like this. They make you think about your days in high school. The pressure, love, hate, bullying, fights all in a good way though, I like how they break it down to different perspectives and sides of the story. I love the actors and storyline, Worth the money and time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I waited months for this book with baited breath!  How can you leave us hanging like this? There are so many loose ends not finished. PLEASE tell me there will be more?
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jefferey Archer always keep you guessing until the very end.  He has such great language skills and a good flow to his words and storyline.  I look forward to his books and have read everyone.  I read this in three parts so it was hard to follow with the long wait till the next edition.  I had to go back and read part one and two again, but it was worth it.  I would like to see the meaning of some of his English words as they weren't familiar.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|As far as puzzle solving games go, this one is ok. There is a whole lot of back and forth between scenes, which drives me kinda crazy, and there are a lot of things that you discover at the beginning that don't get solved until the very end, which also drives me crazy. I ended up using the cheats a LOT more than any other similar type game I've played, mostly because of all of the back and forth action and the unsolved puzzles... I completed it in a few shorts hours - broken up by breaks. For 99¢ it was worth it, but I'd never pay more than that for it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this story disturbing but even more so, annoying.  I liked the premise but it just got a bit carried away with itself.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|This charger didn't work on my Camry - lose connection and won't charge. So I had to return the product..<br /><br />Edit : I have upped the review from 2 stars to 3 stars due to Anker's excellent customer service. They followed up via both email and phone regarding the return and offered to send me a new one for free for trying it out again. Once I try the new one I'll update my review again.<br /><br />Final Update : I have received a new one from Anker for free and this one works fine.
B000FC1MCS|1.0|I guess that is why I disliked this book had no patience with Christopher know he could not help it but still
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|The beauty of this red lp is a real attention grabber. It looked so damn great that I didn't want to place it on my turntable. I was taken back by the clarity and  detail of sound produced. Hard to believe it was not a new remastered cd that I was listening to. It is that good! This a must own for vinyl fans and Blade Runner fans. Very highly recommended. Shipped fast in 2 days using prime. Well packaged in firm lp box.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I loved it, could not put it down, kept me guessing until the very end.<br />Hope there is another one
B009YN2M7S|3.0|I liked the book up to the end... I get the writer wanted to have a shocking ending but it kind of ruin the main line of the story which is actually a situation a lot of women go through in real life.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Very good book.  Made you feel for each character and their sorrow<br />  This would make a great movie.  Good author.  I have read other books she has written.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|Book is well written and the story is a good insight of what is going on these times. I guess is a hard topic to address
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|A fun & pleasant movie experience, for the whole family to enjoy! At times the computer generated effects are very obvious, but it doesn't take way the fun of the movie!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|From this book I liked the fact that it kind of lets you inside the mind of a person that has mental problems. I didn't like that the ending was kind of rushed. After the whole book was spent in the obsession he has for his wife and at the end it seems like his feelings change all of the sudden
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|A typical Hollywood big budget film, but still kicks some booty!! I loved the car chase scene, I wanna see how that was filmed? There's no real over the top stunt action scenes like the last Die Hard movie, with the plane! A few that are close to being total B.S., However, it still a very fun movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is entertaining from beginning to end. The story is real, easy to follow and not predictable. Perfect combination of drama, romance, suspense and on top of it, it was funny too. Recommend it 100%!!!
B00138J9FU|5.0|Yes, Black Sabbath were the progenitors of metal in the purest sense, Priest handily holds the title of the band to bring it into the mainstream. Different opinions abound about who the real ambassadors of metal to mainstream were, but Priest's approachable sound and revolutionary attitude ultimately made it the thing to listen to. That said, British Steel is the band's White Album, a greatest hits album of all-new material that came to define the band. As far as the digital remastering, frankly, the sound is no different from the original album, less the pops and clicks indicative of great vinyl. The vocals are kind of reedy, and it sounds like it is just what it is: an album recorded in a house without special equipment of any kind. In fact, if I recall correctly, the light slapback echo on Halford's vocals is from tracking his parts from the kitchen. The lacking production values actually make it more endearing and personal, so it's a blessing in disguise that the remastering essentially did nothing, as it allows the listener to recapture the experience of throwing it on the turntable for the first time back in 1980. Orthodox metalheads, those of us who can trace the path from Robert Johnson to Trivium, will always enjoy this album, as will those who enjoy harder rock and proto-metal (Zeppelin, Nazareth, obviously Priest, etc.) and fans of modern lo-fi indie rock (Jet, Black Keys) who are looking for something with that brilliant garage sound and some extra heft.
B0015HZAK2|5.0|This is just after punk, some called it New Wave, but really it was just U2 doing what they had and knew best. Yes, U2 did a lot after this, and there's a bit of Bono moralizing in the lyrics, but they are just obscure enough here. Very tight and danceable (I sweated to this stuff on the dance floor). Fun stuff. And before Bono became an insufferable moralizing world changer. Before he dozed us off with how wonderful satellites are. I will still dance in the kitchen to this CD. And it's live!
0374158460|5.0|It is an entertaining book I enjoyed reading it and. I really hope it would be turned into a movie
B009MYARIK|5.0|All of Sophie's books are so good and easy to read. This one was great and made me want to visit Greece!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We tried to play the discs on 2 different blu ray & it would not work! Just sits there with no response on the player or TV. We ran an update on the player & still wouldn't work. I purchased the set over a year ago & can't return it! Don't waste your money on this!
B008X6N1OA|5.0|After I fiddled with the blu- ray trying to figure out why I could not reset for 3-D I pulled the code card for the Mobil APP and found the 3-D BLU-RAY behind the card. I only review 3-D and not a sample of my taste. In this case it is very good and the credits have four layers. I also enjoyed the film that had action, comedy, and music.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Even though &#34;The Trooper&#34; is everyone's favorite song I have to say that &#34;Where Eagles Dare &#34; And &#34;Die With Your Boots On&#34; are jams too. The entire album kicks butt, This is a must have for any Iron Maiden fan .
B0009S4IHY|5.0|this move is so epic! i love it! its weird yet entertaining! one of the best movies i have ever seen! one of my favorites too! i cant stop watching it and it makes me laugh every time i watch it!
B000022TSW|4.0|My fault for not reading more about this DVD, sure for the folks who like them short rude dudes this is part of their collection, but I collect the series, not much on their movies so far, maybe this will change me if I watch it a dozen times! :)
1595825045|5.0|I've been looking for this book in my country but it's been out of stock for a while. I ordered it online instead and I'm glad it arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />The details of how the creators of Avatar discussed their concepts are exactly what I'm looking for! I hope I learn much from their conceptualizations that I could make my own stunning franchise.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|.Awesome game.  Very fun and challenging highly recommend for all ages.  I've been playing nonstop for a couple hours. Addictive
0425263924|5.0|I hated the long wait for this books release. When I first started reading it I was disappointed. I felt like the Eva character I loved was such a wuss. Chasing her tail. Constantly doubting Gideon. I felt like the whole book was going to be this back and forth on and off again relationship. It took about 120 pages to get me drawn in. After that I could not put the book down. I just finished the book. I am glowing like I just had the most amazing orgasm ever! I am still so into this series. Can't wait for book 4. Sylvia Day you did an awesome job. It was well worth the wait!<br /><br /> flag
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I have been a fan of the series for a long time.  It was good to have a tale from Ivan's point of view.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Was so excited to see that this was on my Kindel. Bought it as a pre pay. Yet another great story for Gideon and Eva tying up some loose ends and learning more about each other. Can't wait for the next step of their lives....just don't want to wait too long!!!!! When is the next book due out????
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|amazing game I cant stop playing it all the dragons are so cool! I am very pleased because I have played games like this but none are as good. awesome

0738710261|5.0|This beautiful deck of Tarot cards is ideal to take along when traveling, as they take up very little room in a suitcase and are extremely light weight.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Build houses and break blocks. There are cows,sheep,chickens and pigs there are creative and survival modes it is the bomb.com
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game, my 5yr old loves it especially when he fights the boggans to earn points<br />This is just my thanks to whomever made this game
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Amazing graphics. Plenty to do not a lot of down time between building your world. Started playing one afternoon and couldn't put the game away. Love how the game matches with the movie storyline. Allows for an opportunity to move up in the scoreboard by challenging others.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love the aura of mystery that is retained throughout the book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, excited and anxious to the very end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I believe it touches on feelings and emotions that people are afraid to dwell on. This book hits deeper, touching emotions that are too often shut out or ignored.<br /><br />Charlie is a remarkable character. His honest, innocent eyes narrate every person he meets. He refrains from judgment, and his naive demeanor leaves much to be explored.<br /><br />This book gives all readers who are struggling in any emotional way an outlet. It makes an audience think about themselves on a deeper level, and figure out if there is a moment where one could ever really be &#34;infinite&#34;. Definitely one of my favorite books.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is much better than any other ive used. Much sturdier construction than cheaper headsets with cheap ear pieces. Completely covers your ears which just lends to its superior headset sound. Immediately noticeable that the sound quality is better than others. Lots of options in the User Interface.<br /><br />Only complaints is that it can easily warm up your head. It may take some tweaking in the program.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|THIS GAMES ROCKS THE HIZZZY.  I love it I really do, you should buy it as fast as you can you won't be dissatisfied I am so glad that I bought it is so much fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the game but how do you earn gems? It would be better if there was a easier way to earn more gems then 1 per level up o r buying tbem
B004J4XGN6|4.0|The information in this book couldn't have come at a better time. My corporate division is currently involved in launching IT businesses in India and Nigeria. Now I understand what we really need to be measuring to create sustainable businesses. The pages are filled with good examples, practical wisdom and clear steps on what needs to be done. It was well worth the time investment to read. A book that I've already refered back to several times for guidance.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had heard so much about how this book was awful, but whatever I heard was nowhere near the truth. This book is even worse than I could've imagined! It is poorly written, no character depth, and the sex scenes are not exciting at all. Overall, this book is essentially about an abusive relationship disguised as as a pseudo bdsm relationship. I wouldn't recommend at all.
0061191981|5.0|You say you wanna be a professional chef!!  Then this is a must read for you.  The amount of hard work and abuse you will encounter is exactly what Chef Ramsey endured through his life.  Starting with the abuse he received from his father who said you have to be a \\"poof\\" to be a chef to the highly regarded chefs who abused him on his rise to a 3 star Michlin restaurant.  If you have a goal in life to become a master chef, then you must be able to handle it all the way to stardem.  Chef Ramsey explains what it takes to become a successful chef.. persistence and hardwork.  Knowing him a lot better now explains his attitudes about becoming a chef today.

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I received Oz the great and powerful 3d package, purchased from amazon was outraged to find there were no special features or blu ray disk in said pkg or on said disk and promptly returned it. I am a Disney rewards member and saw an unlocked offer for a separate $5.99 for the blu ray with special features, then noticed the flyer in the disk saying to get the blu ray you needed to join disney rewards and apply for said reward. I guess if youre not willing to join nor pay over $31.34,( plus tax if bought outside of amazon), plus %5.99 you are on your own.I was astounded! Also the digital copy is restricted to one retailer Amazon, Vudu or Itunes, not two as is normal for $29.99 or less 3d, blu ray, dvd and ultraviolet plus digital copy dvds. I am so thankful to Amazon. I returned that sucker no questions asked. Out of order. other retailers you would have been stuck.In what world?! On top of that the offer for $8.00 off your overpriced theater ticket of Lone Ranger 3d or 2d on Disney Rewards is limited to a measly $8.00 not the usual $10.00 or more AND RESTRICTED TO THE BLU RAY DVD COMBO VERSION NOT THE 3D VERSION. THE $5.00 Coupon they had for preorders I noticed was also only on the blu ray version not the 3d version. I forgoed that to buy the 3d version and that is what I get? On Disney.com as far as I know, and at brick and mortar and other online retailers its $34.99 plus tax and this is what you get? This is an outrage! I could have bought the blu ray version and converted it to 3D ON MY 3D BLU RAY PLAYERS. This is an outrage! I highly doubt I will be doing that. If I do it will only be for the $8.00 off the Lone Ranger ticket. OUTRAGEOUS!!!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book.  I loved how it unwrapped the good and the bad of the past and showed how the lives of the slaves intermingled with the white plantation owners.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I would like to get this game for my brother to play and also me and my sister but it costs too much... maybe $5 would br better.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|So much funnier than I expected!!! We loved the movie and it'll be a classic in our household. Great gift for dads.
B005LAII9O|2.0|This movie is horrible for so many reasons.<br /><br />1. the narrating from the lead actress is horrible, it go's for the entire movie from beginning to end and sounds just bad... really bad<br /><br />2. no nudity, very sexual movie (pretending to be) but no nudity,<br /><br />3. Ending is poorly done, showing a director that has no guts to do something powerful so it's just lame and bad.<br /><br />the movie try's really hard to be something good and powerful but ends up being lame and stupid.

B008O69SZ0|5.0|I was a Mott the Hoople fan years ago and continued to listen to Ian long after the band was no more. This album has all the energy and keen songwriting that makes Hunter one of my favorite artists. If you like Ian, get this album.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game to waste time.  I like it.<br />No problems with app. I have not had to purchase anything to play.
B008M0TMXQ|4.0|I usually wear and 8 in crocs, but these are a little small.  My big toes touches the front.  I ended up stretching the  strap in the back to give my foot more room in the shoes and wore a band aid on my toe to prevent a blister from starting.  I would recommend going up a size if you know what size you wear in other crocs.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Great book for some light laughs during the summer. Reads like a conversation with a friend - funny jokes and real experiences from a woman who didn't have an idyllic youth but has turned into a real role model.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is awesome. I already beat it. GTGASAP- Get this game as soon as possible. This is worth the money.
B001993Y2C|5.0|The collection is the best buy for the money for a true battle star fan.  the episodes and discs are flawless.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|It's tough to say anything new after 678 or so comments left here, but I think I can add a few insights of my own.  The first being that I absolutely agree it is an often forgotten album in the Floyd canon.  But I must say, every few years I return to Floyd's albums for another go round, and the first one I always reach for is ANIMALS.  It just seems the most direct and least fussy album and for me is really the last album they made as a GROUP.  I have read the arguments that Wright didn't show up, but I have to totally disagree--for an album that is seemingly so guitar driven, they manage to pile a staggering amount of keyboard layers, as many as probably were stacked on WISH YOU WERE HERE.  And it is those layers that really give this album a spatial/geographic quality that is unique to the album--the eerie stillness in the middle of \\"Dogs\\" during which several dogs bark and bay, the watery melodiousness of the keyboards that opens \\"Sheep,\\" the rollicking piano rolls that punctuate the choruses on \\"Pigs.  Unless someone else is playing those keys, or Wright was told precisely what to play and how to play it, it's hard to accept he had a limited role.  So the album reminds me much more of earlier rocking efforts like \\"Careful With That Axe\\" than it does of anything they recorded afterwards.  I also agree that it is Waters at his most acerbic and caustic--the lyrics are direct and unsubtle and lack any pretension and are sung with an edge by both Gilmour and Waters that perfectly compliments the attack of the songs without overburdening them.  Perhaps ANIMALS is my favorite precisely because it has escaped canonization and remains a looser, gutsier listen than many of their so-called masterpieces.
B00CIP57Z8|4.0|I like to original movie and wanted to see more of what happen to Yossi.  The movie could have been longer in showing Yossi's life before he started to come out of his lonely life after the death of Jagger.  His new life has just started when the movie ended.  I hope to see another sequel to this movie.  This  movie reminded me much of Israeli life and the general tolerance of Israeli's to gay people.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|I really love the sound of Caleb's voice.  I've become a big fan of Kings of Leon recently and this album didn't disappoint.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|You know that when kids, ages 10-16, love a movie such as this one, its gotta be good. I give it a 5 for awesome entertainment.
B00AKKS278|5.0|This book got me motivated, off my butt, and back to work, early in the morning! Not only do I feel more creative for writing (I'm an author) during those wee hours, but I also easily finish my workouts, which I always fail to do if I wait until the afternoon or evening. Best part, those workouts fly by before the sun comes up and you feel so much better starting your day. I did take me a few days to adapt, but I was locked into my new early morning routine in no time. Big thanks to the author for such great inspiration.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|All I have to say is Ozzy Still ROCKS!!!!!! Loving every second of this CD.  Feel like I am back in time.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great and useful app. I wasn't expecting it, but after trial it was awesome. I strongly recommended. Or you will regret
B003SI605K|5.0|This is a wonderful, touching movie. It is well made and the acting is marvelous. I 've seen several times and I always find it touching.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable. It reminded me of 100 floors. 8 levels was simply not enough. Please make new levels as soon as you can.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Could not stop watching it. Went through the whole season in three days.. It does get a litlle slow at the end

B004L86718|1.0|This is a really long and boring movie. There a few good songs in it, but that is the only good thing I can say about it.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|A Good Day to Die Hard was such an awful, awful disappointment. My wife and I loved the original Die Hard. The second one was OK, the next was passable, but this was just unwatchable. The plot is flat and shallow, the writing doesn't even try to bridge the gaps between action scenes, the lack of continuity makes you think you missed whole scenes and the technical details assume that the audience has no understanding of:<br />- Radiation<br />- Distance<br />- Politics<br />- Judicial Systems<br />- Family dynamics<br />- Gravity<br />- Momentum<br />- Traffic<br />- Nevermind, it's not worth the effort the list is too long.

B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Got back from seeing the film this morning and have been listening to the album for a few days. I thought the music itself was very good, and thought it was great after seeing the movie and realizing how well it fit with each and every scene. It really gave all the action and emotion an extra kick in the pants, and Zimmer's propulsive score perfectly fits the character when he's in his element.<br /><br />My main gripe, however, is the album arrangement. It's bizarre, and a little irritating, that the main highlights (DNA, Terraforming, Krypton's Last, If you Love These People) arrive so early on the album. When I first listened, I was waiting for some spectacular finale that, eleven or so tracks later, never came. Thats because I had already listened to it on track seven, in \\"if you love these people\\". It is also rather silly that they put \\"flying\\" and \\"what will you do when you are not saving the world\\" right beside each other in play order. They are very nearly identical save for a bit brighter feel in the latter song.<br /><br />So, great music and a wonderful revisiting of the character, but do yourself a favor and create your own playlist. You'll enjoy it better that way.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />I saw the movie again yesterday, so I put up a list. I don't think I can make an exact movie-order playlist since I don't have the film in front of me, but I'll do my best.<br /><br />1.  Look to the Stars<br />2.  DNA<br />3.  Goodbye My Son<br />4.  Launch<br />5.  I Will Find Him<br />6.  Krypton's Last<br />7.  Oil Rig<br />8.  Are You Listening Clark?<br />9.  Sent Here For a Reason<br />10. I Have So Many Questions<br />11. Flight<br />12. Earth<br />13. Tornado<br />14. You Led Us Here<br />15. General Zod<br />16. You Die or I Do<br />17. This is Madness!<br />18. Terraforming<br />19. Ignition<br />20. Arcade<br />21. If You Love These People<br />22. This is Clark Kent<br />23. What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving the World?<br /><br />Now, It was difficult for me to place \\"This is Madness\\" and \\"You Dir or I do\\", mainly because when Jor-el says the former quote, the music doesn't match up, and neither does it when Zod says \\"You Die or I Do.\\" \\"This is Madness\\" sounds like the scene where the U.S. army converges on Smallville, and \\"You Die or I Do\\" sounds a lot like when Superman is fighting Faora. \\"You Die or I Do\\" and \\"Arcade\\" seem mostly interchangeable, though. Arcade is just longer, so I put Arcade later on the list.<br /><br />If anyone else thinks they have a more accurate list, put it in the comments section for me! :)It was difficult for me to place \\"This is Madness\\" and \\"You Dir or I do\\", mainly because when Jor-el says the former quote, the music doesn't match up, and neither does it when Zod says \\"You Die or I Do.\\" \\"This is Madness\\" sounds like the scene where the U.S. army converges on Smallville, and \\"You Die or I Do\\" sounds a lot like when Superman is fighting Faora. \\"You Die or I Do\\" and \\"Arcade\\" seem mostly interchangeable, though.

B008NIS2SS|5.0|Top best jazz pianist ever.  A tremendous value.  Highly recommended.  I have top quality audio components and the quality of the recordings is excellent.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Let me begin by saying I am a Superfan. I've read as many Superman comics as I can get my hands on, seen all the cartoons and sat through the ups and downs of ten seasons of Smallville. So I have very specific expectations of Superman on film, and a have a very specific idea of what the character is supposed to be like.<br /><br />This movie delivered.<br /><br />Any who have read Superman: Earth One by J. Michael Strazynski will notice some similarities in the approach this movie takes with the character and the storytelling. Superman is forced to come out of hiding thanks to an ill-timed alien invasion, and the propulsive action and the reflective soul-searching play nicely beside one another. The movie has an edge and moves quickly.<br /><br />Henry Cavill is perfect as Superman, his anger and frustration and confusion at being alone on earth is deliciously underplayed. Some have stated that he is humorless. This is far from the truth. Lois is around to bring that humor out of him, and help him on his journey, just as it is in the comics. The movie does well to jettison the dated notion that Clark's glasses fool Lois, and the movie is all the better for it.<br /><br />As for the villains, Faora and Zod, while both very different from one another, are amazing. Faora is a vicious warrior, Zod a calculating tactician, and both are played well by their respective actors. It is amazing to finally see Superman come up against villains that are able to hold their own against him.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />The fanboy in me was also given quite the treat when Lois meets Jor-el, and the two wreak havoc on an alien vessel in order to rescue Superman. It's nice to finally see Lois be something more than a distraction to the Man of Steel.<br />*END SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />The thing that really sold the film for me, though, was the shocking moment in the film's finale (people who have seen this will know exactly what I'm talking about). While it IS truly shocking and never before seen in a Superman film, there is precedence for it in the comic book, specifically in John Byrne's run on Superman during the 80's. Said moment is climactic, unavoidable, heartbreaking and tragic. I was floored.<br /><br />If you are a longtime fan of Big Blue, and want to see a movie about him taken seriously, with heavy emotional weight and stunning action, then SEE THIS FILM. You will not be disappointed.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|This is kind of a fun movie with good acting and a lot of unexpected twists and turns. Depp and Jolie do a good job in spy or suspense movies. This one starts out with a regular American guy getting caught up with a female that appears to be some kind agent. The movie takes a lot of interesting twists and turns and has something of a surprise ending. In some ways, this movie is a lot like many others, but it is just unique enough to make it feel like you are seeing something a little different.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book, however it did get a little technical at some points and would take some determination to continue, but overall was a good book.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Let's you look for clues to open doors to next floors. Is ok to pass time. Nothing special. 100 floors game is more challenging.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I really liked the way this book started out, had me bustin up laughin 'cause we all know how men really think and the author has that down to a T.<br />After he fell in love...there was no more humor. It kind of went downhill from there.  Sure wish the second half of the book was as good as the first.<br />And the snide remarks during the love scenes was a definite no no.<br />Miss Chase has a great comedy writing mind, tho.<br /><br />Had to give it 3 stars. End was boring. Will definitely give her another chance, because she is a very funny writer.<br /><br />J
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I think this is the BEST Holmes/Watson pairing ever!  Love the show not only because of the brilliant acting but it's also entertaining as well.  It's stays true to the books even it is set on modern day.  Can't wait for Season 3

B000001ESJ|5.0|i think if someone told me i had to choose a favorite album by rush this would be it. But all their albums are my favorite because they haven't put a bad one out.  thank you
B000F8O35U|4.0|I ordered this DVD for my 2 daughters.  They both loved it! We had just come back from Disneyland and they are so into the princesses.his movie brings back memories of when I was growing up.  I would recommend starting a collection with all of your favorite Disney movies.  This movie is definitely ranked #1.  I was expecting to have the DVD before we left on our vacation, but did not receive it in time.  I was not disappointed with the movie itself, however was upset with the time it took for the movie to arrive and the condition of the DVD.  I purchased this DVD from M&W DVD Depot. I expected the movie to arrive within the specified estimated time, however, it came 3 days late.  also when opening the package, the DVD case was cracked on all sides, even parts of the plastic fell off when I took it out.  I opened the DVD right away to find actual fingerprints on the DVD!!  I did not expect to have such a poor display of a supposedly &#34;new&#34; product.  I played the DVD and it was fine.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Worth reading good info for young people and for those who need a jump on socializing. Thanks for a good read.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game good graphics need to be smart with your money and make good decisions. Keep your people happy have good flow with your trucks buses oil tankers
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I had purchased the book because I enjoyed the A&E series so much. I was a little hesitant because I did not believe it would be  as good as the series. In fact it is much better. I still enjoy the series but you can't fully develop the characters and provide the necessary history in 45 minutes a week. There is excellent pacing, humor and surprise in the book. Seeing Robert Taylor and Lou Diamond Phillips on tv give me a voice to the characters. I am on the second book in the series and Craig Johnson is going to become one of my favorite authors.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|You absolutely can't go wrong with this book. Whether you are a beginner or fitness freak, this book can benefit you.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|First off this movie is a must see no matter who you are<br />Second off if you are a completions or a person of OCD save your time and money buy the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack there is a coupon inside that will get you the 3d disc for only $5.99 plus tax where applicable so there you go you will have the complete set for less then buying all the discs separately. also WARNING DONT BUY THE DIGITAL COPY you will use the same code for not only getting the 3d disc but a code for amazon to get the digital copy for FREE a $19.99 value and you can do all this by signing up for a free service called the Disney movie rewards you see that pretty little star on the box your title gives you points and other specials like right now at the time of this writing you get a free ticket for the new Disney movie coming out soon for the lone ranger so there is another sales point there for ya. enjoy the film as I wont spoil it here all I can say is that its a feast for the senses and the 3d was done really well and I cant wait to have that disc myself. Happy Viewing
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Talk about sitting on the edge og my sit. Engaging, thrilling, had me hooked in the first few pages. Story changes and unexpected things happen which have you wondering where it going . Then whips you back. Best book read this year.

B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I saw my friend playing this on his phone and wanted it for my kindle. Sadly I did not see it on the store. When I was scrolling through recommendations I was excited to see that hill climb racing. I downloaded it right away and started playing it. After starting I found it was very fun and addictive. This game is great overall, the only complaint I have is that it is a little repetitive but don't let that stop you from trying this game.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|i wanted a hard copy and so far cant figure out how to download since i dont have a kindle fire.  sucky!!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I don't love all the selections the same, but pretty much like 'em all.  If you like Bruce, you'll like this CD.  If you don't care for Bruce - why are you even reading this!  :)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It's a typical Day story- good story and steamy scenes.  Plot wasn't as riveting as the second book, but Eva and Gideon can only have so much drama.  Enjoyable read and I'm okay with their story not ending so soon.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It is exactly what I expected.....very durable and fits great in my pocketbook.  Glad I purchased it. Would definitely recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|MY HORSE IS AN AWESOME GAME I PERSONALLY HAVE HORSES OF MY OWN AND TO PLAY A GAME WITH A HORSE ON A ELECTRONIC IS AWESOME.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Truly I love this game, but in order to progress or complete some quests you have to buy diamonds. And the diamonds are way over priced. Also some of the quests are made to make you lose gold for us less things like lights roads and benches. They say they really help out but I find that I'm spending more money than I'm getting back.
B005RKBZEI|5.0|Been a huge Darren Hayes fan from the beginning of his Savage Garden days to present.  Was so excited that he was releasing another album and could't wait to get it.  Downloading the mp3's was simple and easy and as was adding them to my iTunes library and onto my phone and ipod from there.  The kids and I enjoy his music and listen to songs from this album daily.  Absolutely fantastic all the way around!
B00AKFG15S|1.0|Hello,<br />i have bought and the first 3 clifton chronicles to find that there isn't the number 4 on amazon clifton. Where is the Clifton chronicle 4? I can't believe It is nowhere to be found!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The show is absolutely hilarious, loved getting to see all the shows in order instead of having to catch them when I can on tv.  Packaging was good, the discs were in great shape/no scratches and the case was also in great shape.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Surprising mesh of pop, rock and hip-hop soul. Took a second listen-through to appreciate the style, but then...I can't get enough! Love it!

0789204096|5.0|This is a great coffee table book and the collection of covers evokes memories of simpler times. Flipping through the book, you will gain an appreciation for the breadth of Rockwell's work; he is one of the most prolific cover artists.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Love the Fifty shades books, greats scenes and i just had to keep reading and see how the characters got on in the end, hard to put down.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I appreciate this book because it appeals to both my science set interests (BS Biology, pre med) and the practical, in terms of tips for implementing an IF schedule. This book is truly interesting and would dovetail nicely with a review of energy and metabolism in an Anatomy and Physiology class. Furthermore, the more advanced student will appreciate some of the cell signaling aspects of the book.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Love the Fifty shades books, greats scenes and i just had to keep reading and see how the characters got on in the end, hard to put down.

B004ADV552|5.0|Truly one of the unappreciated saxophone geniuses, at least by the general public. First download of his music but based on this LP I will purchase more in the future.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I have the green one and like the finish just a bit more with its matt green paint; this one has a very glossy reflective black paint and I would prefer a matt finish.  They are both accurate given the price and great beater watches.  Definitely worth the ~54 I paid.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Hard to go wrong with Seger & Silver Bullet. All the popular hits and a few of the lesser known ones too. MP3 download was fast and efficient.
1451673442|5.0|This book is amazing<br />Is clear in the concept<br />each chapter guide you deep in your conciseness<br />And is very practical, practice made the perfection<br />I gifted to all my friends because miracles are real
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|You dont have to pay but there are advantages if you do. good game though. No issues on blaze s2. Graphics are pretty.
B00112GVFO|5.0|It's a decent action flick. If you like Matthew McConaughey's movies, this is will be added to your list.<br /><br />The sarcasm & camaraderie between McConaughey & Zahn is thoroughly entertaining; I wish I had a best friend like that...
B000QUUD60|5.0|I love Elvis.  What more can I say?  This shows Elvis at the peak of his sexiness; healthy and oh-so-talented.  Over forty years ago and the material is still entertaining and fresh.  I have seen many many concerts.  It has always amazed me how Elvis could hold an audience's attention with just himself on stage and only minimal backup from his backup singers and band.  Other entertainers needed flamboyant fireworks, glitzy backdrops, scantily clad dancers, etc.  I was blessed to have attended two of his concerts in the early 70's and there was a reason why the announcer always said at the end of his shows &#34; Ladies and Gentlemen, Elvis has left the building.  Thank you and Good Night.&#34;  Otherwise there would have been a stampede of people climbing up onto the stage to go after him.  Let me try and explain.  Elvis always gave his all at his performances, often going over the expected amount of time.  At one of the concerts, as much as I was enjoying it, I noticed that the performance was going well over thirty five minutes over the allotted time.  I glanced over at some of his backup singers to see how they were faring wondering if maybe they may be in need of a pee break or something.  Elvis was still going strong.  But no, they were intent on focusing their complete attention on their boss who was single handedly orchestrating the entire show.  Elvis commandeered the show, setting the pace and tempo throughout.  He decided how long the show was and when it was over.  Elvis had a way of noticing things like when an audience member (myself) might be in a little bit of danger of being crushed by other over exuberant fans trying to clamor over her in an effort to get closer to see Elvis.  Elvis was not above stopping singing and effectively stopping the entire show to gently and humorously admonish the offenders.  It left me in awe that he noticed and he cared and he actually did something about it.  I still think of that day.  It was things like this that madehim more than an entertainer.  By the end of the show, when I and the rest of the audience realized that he had left the stage and wasn't coming back out, I had a sudden urge to go after him and drag, pull or coax him back out.  It was as if  &#34;No, he can't just leave.  He was just getting started.&#34; Then just when I'm preparing to get my purse and go after him, the announcer makes that announcement and I suddenly realize he's already gone so therefore there is nothing I can do.  So I sit in stunned disbelief and try to concentrate on my clapping.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a match free game that I love.  I love match 3 games.  This one is very challenging because you have multiple items to collect in order to win a level.  So far I have not  gotten so frustrated that I give up on a layer.<br /><br />Thank you Big Fish Games!!  (I already have several BFG on my pc - now I can get them for my Kindle!)
B000FA675C|4.0|I like the character development an d the pace of action.  Always keeping you on your toes as you guess at the next step.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Though not the strongest in the series of The Cemetery of a forgotten Books, this book is still a winner. If you like the authors previous two books, you will thoroughly enjoy this. I'm eager to see how everything ties together in the final installment.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was super fun and hard to put down. Great graphics and story. I just wish they would be up front about 5$ cost instead of pretending it's free. G5 makes awesome (although pricey) games. Love this one!
B002BJGYV2|5.0|The fifth season has Rory at Yale trying to maintain a relationship with the no-longer-married Dean.  Lorilei has begun a relationship with diner owner Luke, while Emily and Richard continue to live apart.  Focused more on partner relationships than the mother/daughter relationship, this season expands to include all of the other characters in Stars Hallow and Yale through their romantic encounters.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is a great work. It has such depth and so many facets. We are not our own, we are all connected through time and space. Every sin and every kindness affects the present and the future. Love lifts us up and allows us to transcend. The cinematography and script are great. You may not see how all the stories are connected at first, but watch it through to the end. I love this film! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book excellent I can't wait to read the last one I couldn't put this one down bc I couldn't wait to see what happened next
B004HW7JI8|4.0|I ordered these for my daughter and she loved it. She is a fan of the show so when she told me she wanted the dvd's I ordered seasons 1 and two for her.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game. I like it so much I bought it for my phone and my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Some of the achievements are a little ridiculous but there's a good mix of fun and challenge.
1781162646|3.0|Joyland isn't a bad book but it's not particularly good either. It certainly is not a \\"Hard Case Crime\\" book.  There's maybe 30 pages total dedicated to the crime.  The rest of the book is a coming of age story and a fairly predictable one at that.  In fact that's probably the best way to describe the book: Predictable.
B009GEDP26|1.0|can not understand why we paid for a repeat of a tv show. will just wait until the show airs again on tv for free.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I did not have high hopes for this movie- but it was worse than I could have imagined. I couldn't even make through the whole thing. And Zach Braff? If I had known I was going to stumble on him in this flick- I would not have bothered.
032147404X|5.0|cant wait to use this book.. just have been too busy yet to sit down and really get into it.. but it looks like just what I was looking for. pictures and easy to read
B00005Y46O|5.0|I remember when All Right Now came out, I loved the hook and the majestic guitar solo. But it was many years before I got around to checking out the rest of their work. Free was not as polished as their successor band Bad Company (containing Rodgers and Kirke from Free) but Free's simpler approach is also more distinctive and dramatic. The band begs to be heard live (and seen if you can access the videos). This is one of the great live albums: it has nearly all their best songs, and the recording has clarity, immediacy, and impact. Guitar fans absolutely must check out Paul Kossoff, who is really devastating, and gets plenty of time to show off his famous vibrato. Free are one of the best and most distinctive sounding hard rock band of the early 70s.
0307352153|5.0|This book was chosen by my book club as our choice for May.  It arrived promptly in great condition.  It is exceptionally well-written and researched, a very compelling and thought-provoking subject about the psychology of American culture.  Introverts count, too!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|I purchased this dvd just to upgrade to blue ray. It was already a long time favorite. The sea battle scenes are the best.

B000F48D3C|5.0|It was already a favorite of mine, I had to get the extended wide screen version. It did not disappoint.
B00CE004XM|5.0|This is a fantastic collection. Beth's signing and Joe's axe work  have never been better. Give this a listen, you wont be disappointed!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use this for film sets along with a boom mic.  It's super easy to use and the sound quality is amazing for such small gizmo. Again, I would highly recommend this to any sound professional.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This one is so well done.  The puzzles are fluent and are set in a 3d dimension. The atmosphere indicate a deep yet unknown background.  The amount of words is just fine.  Actually I think the letters in submachine series are sometimes a little overwhelming. (But it's still the best)<br />Looking forward to the next game. Definite buy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The thing I love most is all the options they offer for enjoying the game!  Most nonlinear games are not so versatile.
1419702238|5.0|I really like the hard cover, I am into the wimpy kid books, I would really recommend these books to my friends and other kids who like story books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. There's one problem the updates take to long!!! It is a awesome game<br />I play it every day.
1419705849|5.0|I liked the books beacause there are kids just like Greg and Rowley that get picked on by school mates and family..<br />I would recommend thes books to friends and class mates.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I don't know how well this is translated from the original, but I found it a wonderful read.  It is apparently a problem when you get a classical book that was Kindle translated- words are lost in the translation.  I did not notice a problem, and thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoy playing this game.  Relaxing and fun.  I am a grandma and even my grandkids can play and enjoy plus it is free.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I LIKE YOUR BOOKS.<br />YOU ARE MY FAVORITE PERSON.<br />YOU ARE THE PERSON THAT I ALWAYS READ.<br /><br />THANK YOU VERY MUCH

B00CE03UOC|4.0|I beat flow free and when i saw neon flow i got it.  I really liked it. But i do think that it could be harder.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You'll fall in love with the characters; laugh, cry, smile, and feel deeply connected.<br />I was so touched by this book, it's been the easiest read. I love it, and I think it was amazing.<br />READ THIS.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|A rpg with a story and character progression like no other. A good story with good dialog and great gameplay and graphics. Gameloft still remains one of the dominant app developers. I wouldn't mind paying 7 dollars for excellent content as this, but thanks to Gameloft this game would spare you no exspince, unless you decide you purchase optional content in game.
B007HO392S|5.0|The song is really good for me because thats the way i felt when my oldest daughter passed away it has memories for me and i listen to it a lot
B00992CF6W|4.0|Can u fix the sign every time I click on it it freezes my kindle please fix I love this game
B005VPXR3Q|5.0|I loved this movie Kathy Bates was really a fanatic. James Caan was great also. Stephen King movies/books are always awesome. Would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008JFUO36|4.0|With great production values, beautifully-shot photography and the fine performance from Tom Cruise, \\"Oblivion\\" should have been a masterpiece. However, while it manages to entertain throughout its rather lengthy 124 minutes, the sci-fi action film fails to fulfill its considerable potential.<br /><br />Set in the year 2077, after the all-out war with the space aliens \\"The Scavengers,\\" Earth is now virtually inhabitable. While most of the surviving humans migrated to Titan, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) remains on Earth as a repairman of drones intended to wipe out the remaining \\"Scavs.\\" His mandatory work is interrupted when he rescues Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a \\"dream woman\\" Jack frequently meets in his dreams.<br /><br />Sounds familiar? That \\"Oblivion\\" borrowed so many ideas from other sci-fi movies didn't bother me. The problem is that in his sophomore work as a director Joseph Kosinski (\\"TRON: Legacy\\") recycled these ideas in a not-so-creative manner. Each piece is fine, but they do not add up when put together. Hence there are so many strange plot holes. We have to believe that those space aliens that can destroy the moon cannot foresee and prevent Jack Harper's next move after he knows what is really going on.<br /><br />And probably most viewers would realize what is really going on Earth faster than Jack does. Even so, \\"Oblivion\\" is still an enjoyable ride, but with a little more imagination this could have been a much more unique and original action movie.
0812993845|3.0|I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only read one Sophie Kinsella book prior to this one, and it had nothing to do with any shop-a-holics. I enjoyed Can You Keep a Secret, but still never pursued her writing beyond that one. I'm not sure I can claim that Wedding Night will persuade me to read more, but it didn't destroy my opinion of her, either.<br /><br />Sisters Lottie and Fliss are opposites, as sisters can be. Fliss, the eldest, is a single mother and infinitely practical. She works for a travel magazine, tends to her son, and frets over Lottie. Rightfully so, as it happens. Lottie has been dating her boyfriend for a while now and is convinced that he's going to propose. By \\"propose,\\" she hoped to hear \\"will you marry me,\\" not \\"let's go to San Francisco.\\" Crushed, Lottie heads off to lick her wounds. But before she can succumb to grief and misery, ex-boyfriend Ben gives her a call. Remember that pact we made in which we promised to marry each other if we were both still single at thirty?<br /><br />Impetuous, flighty Lottie calls Fliss to spread the good news. Her cheer fails to infect Fliss, however, who is determined to stop this sham of a marriage. She calls Lorcan, Ben's business partner, and joins up with him to keep the wedding from happening. As suspicious as Fliss is of Ben's motives, so is Lorcan about Lottie's. Together, along with Fliss's son, they head to Ikonos to split asunder the happy couple. And oh, hi! It's Richard, Lottie's would-be fianc&eacute;! He's here too!<br /><br />Kinsella switches between Lottie's and Fliss's points-of-view, which helps us get to know the two women but turns out to be dully repetitive. You will read the same thing twice, albeit from different perspectives. The problem is that it wasn't all that interesting to begin with, so this is not a case of doubling the fun. Yet the story engages you, and the characters are likable, if not a bit over the top. We've seen these people before, in other books. They are not original or unique, although some surprises do come our way, plot-wise.<br /><br />What the book lacks in originality it makes up in sheer enjoyability. You can't help but like everyone, even Richard, and you will find yourself wanting to find out what the two sisters will do next. As beach reads go, this makes a fine option.<br /><br />Thanks to edelweiss for the preview.<br />Published on cupcake's book cupboard<br />@VivaAmaRisatainal or unique, although some surprises do come our way, plot-wise.<br /><br />What the book lacks in originality it makes up in sheer enjoyability.

B000MR9D5E|1.0|I ordered this series, already having viewed this AMAZING series at my in-laws, as a gift for my parents, however when it came it was from Thailand!!!!  Therefore obviously it didn't work on American dvd players and my parents gave it back to me.<br /><br />I was VERY disappointed that the seller AND Amazon were not upfront about this BEFORE I ordered it. Now I have no idea if I can even return it, if I can I'm sure I'll have to pay return shipping, etc. Not to mention my parents are out their presents for awhile. This situation makes me not want to order from Amazon again.<br /><br />The series itself, when you buy the American version, is absolutely breathtaking and I would HIGHLY recommended the series. Just not from this seller....
0307352153|4.0|This book was recommended to me by an introvert friend of mine who said I will enjoy it, too, being an introvert myself. I actually never asked myself whether I am an introvert or an extrovert. It has never bothered me. After reading this book I think I am more of an introvert, while not having the entire list of introvert characteristics, though I guess almost no one does.<br /><br />Perhaps the main reason I enjoyed in this book is that all of the things the author mentioned that are typical for introverts I do myself. I oftentimes prefer to stay at home and watch a movie than go out. I dislike small talk and, in general, don't like meeting new people so much. Although after getting to know them, I realize that my objection was superfluous. However, I do not have a problem to speak up and let people know my opinion. So \\"Quiet\\" opened my eyes to a subject I never actually thought about too deeply.<br /><br />Having said that, I think the author has gone over the top on some issues with a tendency to oversimplify things.  She actually put the blame for the 2008 economic crisis on extroverted bankers of Wall Street, who made reckless bets that ruined the economy. Without getting into it too much, the notion that the sole reason for the economic crisis is because of some extrovert bankers on Wall Street is somewhat ridiculous.<br /><br />Despite its occasional shallowness and simplistic manner, I did very much enjoy this book. Cain can surely hold the reader's attention with her engaging writing and I did learn plenty of new things.
B00BESM14U|5.0|The movie starts a little slow...but overall it was a very good movie.  The point is everyone is not the same, but in high school it is hard if you don't fit in.  No one likes to be judged but we all do it.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This book was much better than Matched for me, the story and characters much more compelling, I especially enjoyed Xander and Indie's characters as they seemed much more like a hero and heroine I could root for and aspire towards than Ky who still lacks personality to me and Cassia who can be childish and selfish. I still hated the main two characters which is why I only gave the book 3 stars but the story outside of them was very interesting and exciting.
B0096HL33G|1.0|Don't waste your time on this movie.  Seriously run you would be better off watching re runs of fantasy island.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Who would of figured this was based on a true story. I mean a lot went on in the early '80s. I guess the secret stuff is coming out from the vaults already.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This is very handy for moving around the GoPro menu system with touch screen.  It is also nice for setting up shots but should be shut off when not being used as it is a battery eater.  The GoPro App for your smartphone is a nice alternative.
B0032SQCQI|4.0|I didn't like how the couple was tricked into pushing the button. But, the movie was good. Keeps you wondering.
B0041KXUGQ|5.0|Liked the original movie wanted DVD for home collection
B003JRD5JO|3.0|I did not think there was really anything special about this special edition, other than the several live tracks on it. Could of done without them, but what can I say. It was at a cheap price.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|A lot of good stuff here!  There's classic Megadeth thrash and metal, but with a lot of interesting stuff mixed in.  I remember feeling like I was listening to Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses, punk rock, and country rock at different points in the album.  It's NOT Risk.  It's more like Megadeth's really good version of Metallica's very bad Load and Reload.<br /><br />And oh yeah, bass player David Ellefson sounds AMAZING on this album.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|This was a very good action, drama based movie. I wonder if there is still such programs like this going on.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This was really a neat movie and having just watched older James Bond movies in the past - this one is the best, in my opinion!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It brings city builder and a defense mechanism. The fact that your trying to free America from what looks like a Korean invasion seams very homefront Esq.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I have read some of the comments and I am not happy. So what if it does not have a bigger and smaller line size and I'm over seven years old and it does run on the Kindle Fire. GEEZ People<br />I love Drawing Pad =)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. it is the kind of book everyone 8 years old and up should read because we should all be a little more kind.
0399162097|5.0|Exquisite. Immediately after finishing this, it went on my to-reread list.<br /><br />It's the first person story of Rosemary who is examining the events of her childhood and her memories of it. Rosemary's quirks are that she uses big words and while she is naturally talkative, has been silenced. There are good reasons for these traits and they are used to good effect. I loved the vocabulary of this novel (eliding, Melpomene, gamesome, psychomanteum, hypnopompic) and that it's filled with memorable, beautiful, poignant and funny phrases.<br /><br />Writers, read this for: Structure -- The story alternates between 1979, the protagonist's childhood, and 1996, her college years. Veracity -- The time period and experience of reflecting on childhood family life from the college environment has been carefully, thoughtfully created. It felt truthful and accurately portrayed.<br /><br />Notable: I heard the author read from this novel as a work in progress in 2011 (at WisCon 35, a feminist science-fiction convention) and had been looking forward to it since then. I pre-ordered this novel and it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Also recommended: Karen Joy Fowler's collection \\"[[ASIN:B0058PXQ8U [ What I Didn't See: Stories[ WHAT I DIDN'T SEE: STORIES ] By Fowler, Karen Joy ( Author )Sep-28-2010 Hardcover]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0452286530 The Jane Austen Book Club]].\\" Fowler will likely make be my personal \\"author of the year\\" when I reflect on 2013 because of this and I just read The Jane Austen Book Club.<br /><br />Pairs well with: Pat Murphy's story \\"Rachel in Love,\\" and Carol Emshwiller's novel \\"[[ASIN:1931520089 Carmen Dog (Peapod Classics)]].\\"
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I babysit and she loves this game! you can create your own princess or make yourself and princess or do your favorite disney characters
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|At first I thought the same about not being able to buy the combo all-in-one, but then I realized that if you have a smart 3-D TV, and/or a new 3D Blu-ray player, you actually have both worlds, because not only can you play a 3-D disc, you can change a 3-D disc to 2-D, and visa-versa. Of course, I prefer having a 3-D disc because it is more geared to be watched in 3-D.  Simple as that, plus you still get the digital download to use on the go, and you won't have to store those thicker cases on the shelf.  I rather not have the basic DVD, because once you see it in blu-ray, why would you want to watch it in standard definition. Just FYI.  Thanks for reading my message, and hope more of you catch on to this, because this might be a trend with these companies.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I thought this was a great game but for some reason my kindle fire wouldn't download it. And I was excitied about this game
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|A wonderful read, such a flow in the writing. I was visiting Bath for the first time so thought to read this book as the historic City of Bath is featured. It was exciting to actually visit the areas mentioned in the novel.
193700788X|4.0|I have the entire series so, of course, I was waiting in anticipation for the next book. I am sad that the books are now wrapped up and disappointed in the ending. The story is good but the finale is not the way I would have preferred but the way it should have ended. For fans of the books and True Blood this is a definite one to purchase.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I've enjoyed going back and picking up episodes I missed or have forgotten. There's a reason this ran for 10 years and would count it as one of the top 5 scifi series of all time.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Does what it is supposed to do and handy if you still have some firewire devices and a newer Mac with no firewire port.  Just wish Apple would have left one firewire port on the iMacs.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love the game! it is the second one I've played from them and will get more! Can't wait to play 2!
B002M7A79S|5.0|A really great movie.  Very enjoyable and entertaining to watch and watch again.  I wish the series would have lasted more than one season but this movie does a good job at providing closure for the series.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a great game for those of us who cannot draw but would like to.Adults and children can enjoy. In the most simple manner one can \\"draw something\\" that the other person can actually guess from the letters provided.I would like the ability to accumulate coins(points) to upgrade the level of play more quickly.IMPORTANT: one player used the comments section for a very distasteful  and unrelated  remark
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Fantastic and can't wait for the next season. I like having it on Amazon coz it's easy to access and watch it over my phone.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|I like kids movies that adults can watch and enjoy.  The visual effects in 3D are pretty good, the acting was good (don't remember having any complaints), and it's easy to root for Jack and the princess.  It might be a bit scary for those under 10, but most of the violent scenes are pretty tame.  Definitely a movie I will watch over and over again and I'd recommend it if you have a niece or nephew who has a birthday coming up.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A lot of the reviews are putting the book down for not ending, personally I'm excited there are more. Yeah it was suppose to be a trilogy, who cares. I would rather have an author compose another book before they abruptly ended a series with out a solid ending. The writing was still enticing, there was still somewhere to go with the story and Gideon and Eva are still as complicated yet lovable as ever. I'm thrilled that there is more to come.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I have read this book twice, and there are few books that I can say that about. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Good buildup to ending, but did not like ending, was too abrupt! Hope it's not as long before next one comes out as it was for this one.
B00CDCLL1A|2.0|Well, this was a waste of money and time.  The acting?  Excellent.  The settings?  Superb and beautiful.  The effects and make-up?  Really cool and really well-done.<br /><br />The story?  Like a demon-possessed professor of philosophy and religion rambling in a darkened room!  Scenes from differing storylines are cut and pasted beside each other with no coherence.  You forget who everyone is and why you should even care to remember.  Interesting relationships and ideas are cobbled together into a mish-mash of lunacy I have no patience to stitch together myself.<br /><br />They are all connected by karma, reincarnation, etc. but who the heck cares if I have to WORK at figuring out the storylines!?!  This movie is failure, in my opinion.  It requires way too much patience, time, backtracking, and the use of subtitles to even hear some of the dialogue!  Yes, the invented future speak is a cool idea, but subtitle it or do not cobble scenes from different eras and make believe eras together in such a confusing way!<br /><br />Ugghh.  This film was a frustrating mess.  It had so much potential.  Don't believe anyone who tells you it is so entertaining that they have to rewatch it again and again!  They are rewatching it because the movie is too hard to understand otherwise!<br /><br />AVOID at all costs.  At least someone can save money.  I didn't, but I wish--most of all- that I had my time and brainpower back!  lol.
B000VUFJ3C|3.0|For what its worth the cd is pretty decent - not many songs that you want to put on repeat here - the album &#34;This is Us&#34; was much better but that is my opinion - I did keep the cd because again, there are a few good tracks
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|You probably do not expect much from this movie.  The premise is silly.  But this movie takes a traditional and creepy fairy tale and turns it on its head.  The action is exciting, violent, and gory.  There is a lot of it too, which makes the movie nonstop fun.  These two hunters take a lot of damage, like two John McClanes of the fairy tale universe.<br /><br />The witches look horrifying and have interesting physical aspects.  The setting is somewhat dark Renaissance.  Just after the utilization of gunpowder, which allows Hansel & Gretel to carry around the coolest guns I've seen in a while.  This might turn off fantasy purists but excite steampunk lovers and the like.<br /><br />The troll and the good witches are neat additions.  The characters are all fun to watch, even the extras.  Every character has a purpose too.<br /><br />There are a few plot twists and a lot of fun scenes.  Great experience.<br /><br />Of course, the acting is excellent.  Hansel & Gretel are rough and tumble heroes who get into a LOT of fights.  Their dialogue is a little modernized, but often funny and fitting.<br /><br />If you love fantasy and action, you have to at least least rent this one.  It's a gem.  In fact, if this could have been given another hour and some depth of story it would rank up there with LOTR.
B000E41MS6|5.0|The Doctor and companions are back (It's about time) I was a very big fan of the classic Doctor Who series (Tom Baker and Patrick Troughton were my favorites) and I only have one complaint about this first series - Chris Eccleson should have stayed on longer as the Doctor - Dont get me wrong he was replaced by the amazing David Tennant whom I love and is my favorite of the re-boot Doctors but still kinda wish that Chris would have stayed on another season.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|It is original, which is rare these days. It is funny and exciting.  In my opinion it is appropriate for kids 8 and up.
B0011W2IN8|5.0|The Fourth Series of Doctor Who returns with David Tennant facing off against The Master and saving the world from Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey Stuff!!! one of the best Series' of the re-boot era! David Tennant is remarkable as the Doctor. Definitely a must own for any fan of Doctor Who
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is greatest game I have ever played.I love doing. make-up i also like dressing people up.washing their hair was fun.
B000669GAI|5.0|I love the music however the cd you sent me is scratched on three....yes three songs.  It was new but it is defiantly scratched.  If you like you could down load the cd onto my amazon account.  Thanks
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Couldn't ask for more - never hard to grasp just where your battery life stands - hasn't froze my Fire either. Do get this app.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is for my collection for when I go cable free soon...I can't wait to go cable free I like to choose what I watch and when I watch and I love the pause.
B009NY43NY|5.0|When I started this final Sookie Stackhouse novel I was wondering how Charlaine Harris would be able to tie all of the various plot points together to end this series...well, she did it and it was clean and believable!  Thank you for not just killing off a dozen characters because they didn't have a good way out of the storyline!  I may have to read the entire series again soon!!
B0037VNX44|5.0|Tom Hardy's best look and best role to date.  I saw this a few years and bought it because I love it so. I had seen  Mr. Hardy in a few supporting roles and was so impressed with his transformation here -- whoever won the Oscar that year needs to hand it over to Tom, like right now.  The character the movie is based on is not a nice guy but there are a few scenes that make me feel sorry for him -- especially that part where the patients are dancing and Bronson erratically tries to make his way to the exit.  Say what you will, Hardy embodies the bad ass persona and pulls it off magnificently.  Yes, it's a guy movie but ladies, since Tom Hardy is popular right now, there are a few full frontals, in case you're interested -- one of my favorite movies of all time, Tom Hardy will never get another role like this and I always feel a little sad after  I see it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|After reading the first one I went ahead and purchased the other 4...now I have to wait another 15 months for book 6 to come out...Come on September 2014!! :-)
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Lisa Genova writes brilliantly.  Discussing the early stages of Alzheimer's through Alice's eyes was so emotional and thought provoking.  I loved the family involvement, strength, encouragement and love.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it's easy it's fun it's GREAT for kids I highly recommend this game!!!!!!!!!!! It's REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I mainly use this to control windows media player. I programmed it so I can skip to the next song by tapping on it.  I also change volume, mute, go back 1 song, stop/play player.  I love this guy.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love the spooks games that big fish puts out and have many of them.  It is nice having this on my Kindle Fire.
0802473156|5.0|Seriously brilliant book. This has helped me in many ways be more open to giving and receiving love--not just romantic love, but also in familial love and platonic love. It has helped in almost all of my relationships.<br /><br />The only thing I felt was blatantly false was this statement, &#34;Love is something you do for someone else, not something you do for yourself.&#34; I firmly believe self-love is a prerequisite for true love with a partner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just got this game about a couple of days ago, and I thought that it was going to be the old 0.4.0 version. But when I got it it updated to 0.7.1.  It has zombies, Creepers, and skeletons. It doesn't have Enderman yet so there is no end portal or Ender pearls. Iron is easy to find, just by digging down (even if they say not to) because there aren't very many natural caves or caverns. Iron comes in very big chunks, usually in 5s or 7s.This game is a MUST GET! It is worth $6.99!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book. Loved it. Read it before seeing the movie said to compare - both were very good.  Movie pretty much stayed true to the book.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This game is fun but have seen so many just like it. There is some new twists tho. Good game.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a game worth getting.  The graphics are really spectacular.  This is really addicting and a lot of fun.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Had so much fun on this that I had to have it downloaded on my 20 year old daughter's kindle too.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this is a splendid game for tablet and is amazing to play. also not that much in game purchase. u can play the full game without having to pay a single penny after u buy it. this game should cost more than 99 cents because it is that good.
1423140605|2.0|I know I am probably getting too old for these books. I just never thought about quitting reading Riordan's books. His Percy Jackson series was phenomenal. While he was writing that series, his popularity skyrocketed. I feel like he's fallen into the trap that many authors do; once your books get famous, you throw together a book a year (more with Riordan sometimes) regardless of its quality, because writing is your job. The Kane Chronicles were decent. At least they were a new story. These books, 'Heroes of Olympus', are just an embarrassment to the original series. Why, WHY did you have to make this series? They are filled with unnecessary chapters to give the illusion of a bulky, quality book. These books are too childish. They aren't funny. The conversations and how the characters deal with their enemies are completely ludicrous. The conversations are just stupid. Why do you have to use the word 'man' in every sentence of dialogue? Worst of all though, I don't think Riordan has ever pushed the romance aspect as much as he has in 'The Mark of Athena'. Holy $#!@. The whole book was cringe-worthy, it was ridiculous to include so many romantic thoughts and pieces of dialogue. Just about every page has at least one part that deals with a couple hugging, kissing, saying \\"I love you\\", romantic thoughts, and all around over the top sappy bullsh*t. I'm really starting to hate myself for reading the second series. It takes me a few months to finish the thing, and it sticks a wedge in my reading plan. I'm dropping a load in my pants knowing that the fourth book comes out in 4 months. I refuse to quit reading when I'm in the middle of a series. I'll tough it out; reading these books that are meant for teenage Perca-Beth simpletons.
0375869026|5.0|Very heartwarming story, and made me tear up. Not just any book makes me tear up. It really makes me sad that this didn't win the newbery award.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I gave this game five stars because it was super fun and really cool but the only bad part is that it is not very long. Thank you for creating the game though. :) Mel
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|It sounded like an intriguing movie since there was a little mystery involved.  I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for a happy ending.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A modern love story.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence was a marvel!  Bradley Cooper was not bad either.<br /><br />and those co-stars (robert dinero? )  Pretty awesome.  I loved it!  Wish I had bought instead of rented.<br />did I mention that jennifer Lawrence was awesome?  In the company of actors in this movie, she showed she is the real deal.<br />Proud of her like a momma.<br />just saying.<br />watch it.

0425263991|5.0|This was by far the most compelling emotional and psychological journey yet in the Psy-Changeling series. Hats off to Ms. Singh for the brilliant idea of using the female and male leads as the metaphors for the twin sentients, and their romantic re-unification as the path forward to healing the divide and the PsyNet!<br /><br />I personally could not find a way to give this book its well-deserved 5 star review without discussing the world-shattering events. If you hate reviews with spoilers, then please skip right on by...<br /><br />** SPOILERS **<br /><br />\\"Where the NetMind was an innocent, the DarkMind was akin to an ignored, abused child who sought only to bully and abuse others, knowing no other way in which to interact. In Kaleb, it had found acceptance, a darkness that welcomed the malignant violence and anger at the core of its being.\\" HOO PG 44<br /><br />Despite being bombarded by the negative consequences of Silence, the NetMind sentience retained its innocence, empathy and simple joy for its world. This led the NetMind to \\"befriend\\" a badly abused little boy named Kaleb. Just as child Sahara later befriended an older Kaleb, too. Just as Sahara also represents the \\"minds\\" that did not succumb to Silence.<br /><br />Sahara's years of torture also serve to mimic the bombardment of darkness the NetMind survived. And she too, managed to retain empathy, a childlike joy in simple pleasures like dancing, and a longing to emotionally reach out and bond with others.<br /><br />In contrast, the DarkMind represents the split off sentience that reflects the darkness and hopelessness that results from Silence. Kaleb, much like the DarkMind, is the abused child who managed to survive but tragically was left \\"with a malignant violence and anger at the core of its being.\\"<br /><br />With these metaphors established early in the book, Singh then leads her characters on a journey of self-discovery, and readers to understand that the DarkMind and Kaleb are intertwined. Both must heal in order to heal the PsyNet.<br /><br />For several books we've read \\"The Ghost\\" and others understand Silence must fall in order to heal the PsyNet. The key question been then what? What replacement to offer the Psy populace?<br /><br />Re-enter Sahara who offers a path forward out of the darkness. Sahara and Kaleb form a strong, emotional bond born of love. A bond forged stronger by overcoming so much darkness strewn in their path. Their bond heals Kaleb and also shines like a beacon of hope in the PsyNet sky.<br /><br />When Kaleb reveals their bond to the Arrows to serve as a \\"ray of hope\\" for their own futures, one understands \\"The Ghost\\" finally found his \\"replacement\\" for Silence. His message is clear, if the most dangerous and powerful mind can be \\"anchored\\" by such an emotional bond, then other damaged Psys can take hope as well.<br /><br />With this, Singh sums up the failure of Silence perfectly:<br />Silence was a failed protocol because it denied love and without love there is no hope, and without hope lightness dims and darkness eventually consumes.<br /><br />As for healing the DarkMind,<br />As I see it, the original PsyNet sentience was splintered in two by Silence. The twins wandered lost and their growth \\"stunted\\" because they are incomplete without each other. Lightness and darkness need each other to balance the other out, to develop and grow stronger. The twin minds must reunite as Sahara and Kaleb did, so their unity can heal the DarkMind. The new \\"emotional bonds\\" can then serve as anchors that shed more light into the PsyNet sky as well.<br /><br />Bravo, Ms. Singh, for mirroring the love story so perfectly with your world-building. This was a very rare book that more than lives up to its hype.<br /><br />One last point, like several other reviewers I enjoy the Changelings, too, but for this book I appreciated Ms. Singh wisely did not clutter HOO with lots of \\"guest appearances.\\" She kept the focus where it belonged, on Sahara and Kaleb's journey towards a monumental event in Psy history.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This was a very good, quick read. I enjoyed the story and the characters. You can make it through this book when you have a small amount of time to spare. Having a good book this size is good for when you feel the need to read and can't get into a large novel. A good read.
B004S82OAE|5.0|Started this book but moved on to something else.  The information I read though was good.  Could keep up pretty well and plan on reading still.
B000P5FH3K|4.0|I'd like to think most people enjoy a good underdog movie. Here you get to mix that with courtroom drama and our all encompassing love for insurance companies.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A newly Barred lawyer (Matt Damon) is handling a few cases. The biggest involves the family of a young man with leukemia whose medical claim was denied by his insurance company, resulting in his death. So his first courtroom adventure puts him, and his partner, Danny DeVito (Who's failed the Barr exam 6 times) up against some high caliber lawyers.<br /><br />This is a tight, efficient flick. Coppola uses a quieter hand on this. It doesn't have the razzle-dazzle of the \\"Godfather\\" flicks or \\"Apocalypse Now\\" but the camera always seems to be in the right place and things move well within the frame. This is a near seamless endeavor. The set-up almost requires certain cliches and they are here. Thankfully they're kept to a minimum. This is one of Damon's earlier credited roles but he already shows a comfort in front of he camera. Claire Daines and Danny DeVito were already well into their careers and both do a good job. John Voight plays a real slimeball so it's nice seeing him get his rear-end handed to him.<br /><br />This is better craft than it is art. It's a bowl of beef stew on a cold night. So if ou want some comfort food, it would be a difficult task to find something better.

159463176X|5.0|I caught the Khaled Hosseini bug in high school after being assigned \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and have never sought a cure. \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is inspired -- characters and plot are more daring than ever -- and Hosseini's artistic use of the American invasion of Afghanistan throws everything into perspective. If you thought \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"ATSS\\" were beautiful, pick up a copy of Hosseini's newest novel and prepare to fall in love all over again.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|If I still bought movies I would buy this.  Great movie, great story and great video game nostalgia.  Great great!

B005IU1OMA|5.0|Great video, extreme sport, good hd allows you to take advantage of real colors obviously can only be appreciated in full in video calibration is setup properly
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Had fun watching this movie.  I would have given it 4.5 stars if that were an option.  Not quite a 5 star though.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|Plum Spooky brought back Diesel who is one of the main characters of the Wicked Appetite and Wicked Business series. This book was not as good as Plum Loving I thought. I feel it took on too much of Diesel and the Wulf aspect and sidelined Stephanie's role in the book as the main character and was missing a lot of the usual elements we are accustomed to in the Plum novels. I'm still a huge Plum fan and always will be but this book left a lot to be desired for me. I checked it out from library so if your indifferent about spending the money on it, just check it out from library and save the cost.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|I remember I spent a good amount of time playing this game.  Now I'm going to download and play again.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Have you ever been in the middle of an intense phone call and the line goes dead mid sentence?  Well, it's just like that!  I'm so disappointed that Sylvia did that to her readers.....just to sell another book.  She indicated that this was a trilogy, we waited, and she disappointed.  I will not read the next one or any other Sylvia books.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|As with Khaled Husseini's other books this draws the reader into the lives of the characters. His writing has the perfect balance of detail and pace making the book un-put-down-able.<br />The worse part about the book is that it ends and you wish it didn't.
B00009AOBI|5.0|After decades, this is still such a moving film. A must see for every generation. The film pays respect to a remarkable young man, and it raises awareness for an under represented cause.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app!! It's  great for every kind of picture!!! it has cute frames for the pics! I love it.
0670026603|1.0|I liked the topic because disabled people do not appear quite often in novels. It showed a depressed man and an ignorant woman. What could have been a really uplifting story about suffering, battles and living after all and against all the limits turned to be a really depressing book that says that life is just an option not a gift that we have to cherish. I'm afraid of whom can read it and decide that life and the loved ones are not enough if you're in depression and don't want to live.
B008NNA6OG|5.0|This is her all time favorite movie and she was thrilled to have it on DVD finally! It works and looks great!

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway Suffers is fun and addicting but really really needs levels. HOW many times can one do the same endless route over and over? And what's is the point of the different characters if they don't have special abilities? A couple of tweaks and it will be 5 stars.

B008JFUPK8|2.0|We seem to be living in an age where writers/producers/directors of big summer movies, especially superhero movies, want so badly to jump on the \\"super gritty, realistic, real world\\" fad of the last several years, that they make movies that the audiences have to endure until the end, instead of being entertained by and filled with joy and excitement by the end. This being the 2010s (or whatever you want to call it), it seems uncool for these movies (and other things) to have that sense of awe and wonder and pure popcorn joy that going to these movies used to have. Now, it has to be super realistic, gritty, angsty, etc. To be in the real world. Well, I live in the real world, and I want to go to these movies, especially a \\"Superman\\" movie, to get away from reality for 2 hours. Needless to say, I was not a fan of the movie, despite some excellent work. When I first heard of the movie and the people involved, I feared for what it might be. And that's what it turned out to be.<br /><br />The story, such as it is, deals with a lot of the backstory/origin of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman. I don't want to say too much or go into anything at length here about the movie, but we all get the gist. There is a battle on Krypton and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his only son, Kal-El, on a ship to earth. We see through flashbacks (in a jarring and out of touch style) how Clark was raised by the Kents ( the strong Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, in the only parts of the movie that seem to have anything resembling heart and warmth) in Smallville. About an hour in, Clark dons the famous suit (but don't you dare utter the name 'Superman'), and General Zod (Michael Shannon) comes a calling, looking for something that Jor-El had shipped with Kal-El to earth. It then boils down to a battle royale that, at first impressive, becomes repetitive and as hollow and clinical as the worst \\"Transformers\\" movie. I don't want to say much more than the basics. Leave the rest to you actually seeing it.<br/><br />Henry Cavill certainly looks good in the part and can fill out the suit nicely, but that's about it. His Super-, uh, I mean, his Kal-El is pretty robotic and one note, not showing much of any emotion other than sour and seriousness. None of the appealing charm or wit is here. Out of all the actors to play the role on film or TV ( I have personally been through 5 previously), Cavill's is the least likeable and relatable, with a cold distachment to boot. Writer David Goyer says he wanted to make Superman more realistic and in the real world. So, that means cold and joyless? Everything that is Superman, that has made him the character for all these years, is stripped away. They want to make him relatable, but I found it more relatable in any given episode of \\"Smallville\\". There isn't much to say about the rest of the cast either. They all do what they can with the material, but really, this movie belongs to the action and CGI. There isn't enough material for Amy Adams' Lois Lane for her to bring anything to the role other than just showing up. The chemistry between the two is also non-existent. Hopefully, the expected sequel will atually give this wonderful actress a real part, and amp up the romance and chemistry, which is pretty much a cold fish here. Shannon as Zod is insane, but also way over the top.  I guess shouting makes you real evil. The only ones here I thought did a real portrayal were Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents. Those are the best moments of the movie, and one would of wished the whole movie was with them in Smallville.<br /><br />There is action a plenty in the massive destruction/overly CGI way that it gets to the point of being \\"been there, done that\\". It just becomes two super powerful guys slamming into each other and buildings. It gets old fast and loses any and all impact. Sublety and nuance is not something Zack Snyder seems to strive for here....or ever, really. It's a noisy movie that is noisy for the sake of being noisy. The loud music doesn't help. Composer Hans Zimmer is a wonderful artist. He has done a lot of good work, but there is nothing here. It's just typical action movie music to go along with the noise on screen. Honestly, I am having a hard time even remembering the music now.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Man Of Steel\\" is a very modern superhero movie in the Christopher Nolan mold. Super serious and dark because, as you know, life is serious and dark with no joy or happiness, at least according to Nolan and Goyer. It's a style that has grown rapidly old. It's gotten to the point where it doesn't seem much fun to be the hero anymore or to watch them. Can't we have a Superman movie that is relatable and fun but without all the seriousness? Is that really too much to ask? Can't we have fun? Oh, that's right. I forgot. It's the modern age where that kind of thing is frowned upon. A soulless, joyless, noise machine that Michael Bay could direct in his sleep. It truly appears that the party is over.
B0045HCJQW|4.0|One of the old classics and enjoyable but personally I prefer the remake HIGH SOCIETY.  It's nice to have both for a comparison.
B005HED11Y|5.0|You have to put yourself in a 1960's mode, but it was fun to watch the original Star Trek series again. The remastering is great. Season 1 introduced Khan (Ricardo Montalban), for those who you want to check out the original Khan story. Nice continuity with Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan movie, and nice parallels with the new Into Darkness movie.
B0000549B0|4.0|Very funny and some true to life points of view.  Jimmy Stewart is always great and is so in this picture.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Wonderful software.. gives me the option to select the resolution for the download. . Exactly what I needed!! Way better than the freedi youtube downloader.
B00AEBB97S|5.0|A good mystery story that keeps you guessing.  Also a nice love story.  I recommend it.  Top acting by super stars.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Honestly, I really haven't used it that much, but it seems to work just fine. I take most pictures with my phone, but thought I could have a spare with my Kindle.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|\\"Sunbather\\" is going to knock the family portrait off the wall, strip it of the wallpaper and cause subsidence in your house foundation. Deafheaven have created a post metal behemoth here that is so large it may auger gravitational collapse and a musical black hole. This second album from the San Francisco band of noise merchants comes with songs that roll in at well over 10 minutes and which assault your musical sense in a way which was last achieved by Josh T Pearson's soaring aural assault in Lift to Experience's \\"Texas Jerusalem Crossroads\\" or the works of fellow Lone Star state residents Explosions in the Sky. On these songs George Clarke's rasp screams over the pile driver arrangements which sound like shattering blasts of pure cacaphony. Yet uplifting melody and triumph lurks here not least in the wonderful heights scaled on the opener \\"Dream house\\" whose crescendo builds to a sense of scale and power in its nine minute plus which is completely overwhelming.<br /><br />Thus to describe or to compare this to black metal anymore (particularly the unholy Scandinavian variety) is to miss the point; this is post rock like Slint but done at warp speed. The closer \\"Pecan Tree\\" leaves you gasping for breath. In its 11 minute plus duration its like experiencing a sonic apocalypse which literally pulversises your senses and stops your daily deliberations. Much heavier is the epic mid track \\"Vertigo\\" this time at 14 minutes resembling a mini math rock opera with influences and traces of Black Sabbath, Husker Du and previous greats, and with Clarke's fellow band members Kerry McCoy, Derek Prine and Daniel Tracy whipping up such a fierce musical tornado that you should head to the ground shelter. When it comes to the shortest track on the album \\"Irresistible\\" its like a single in comparison to its lengthy counterparts and provides shelter from the storm from what follows but at the same time it shows how the band are confident in their own skins that amongst all this full on assault they can interject a lovely guitar lament. The eerie neo religious chant of \\"Windows\\" does feel more like an interlude which some may find a distraction. Amends are made however with the pulverising title track that has pitch-warped guitars almost being overcome by fuzz and static. \\"Sunbather\\" is a bold and thrilling album from a band whose music has gone into another league on this release. People of a certain age may question the sanity of those who love this undiluted wall of noise produced by Deafheaven, but you the listener will smile politely safe in the knowledge that something very special is going on here and if others can't recognise that then aren't they the poorer for it?on assault they can interject a lovely guitar lament.

I  truly think  that  this book should be required reading for every student  of any age . We all need hope .  and  William's story  will not only make you smile  . but hopefully will  inspire us to use and share the gifts  the Lord gives us .  gw
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I basically agree with those who have written bad reviews for this book. This should have been the final book, we are being cheated/ tricked to pay $50 for a story that should have ended long ago, there were a lot of unnecessary fillers. I would have returned this book if I didn't finish the book way after the return capability. It took me so long to get through this book, because I just wasn't interested after a while. I like many were so excited when the book came out thinking we will get some closer. WRONG! I will have to think long and hard if I will purchase the upcoming books.

B005JTAP4S|4.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale is a story about a young boy who is transported to a magical world populated with all sorts of unusual denizens. Many of the people and creatures Peter encounters are relatively friendly individuals who either help Peter or are helped by Peter. However, there are equally as many dangers for Peter to face. It feels almost like a nightmare, starting out fairly benign and gradually becoming darker and more intense as the story progresses.<br /><br />At first, our protagonist's journey seems to be a series of brief, disconnected adventures that merely slingshot us from one locale to the next. But as we continue to travel deeper and deeper into O'Brien's world, connections start to form between the various adventures Peter undertakes and a central antagonist emerges. From the large array of individuals Peter encounters throughout the book, he starts to accumulate a small group of companions who help him face this threat, unconditional friendship and love blossoming between Peter and his friends.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story. The narrative is full of rich descriptions and I loved O'Brien's flowery prose. The way the story is written feels a lot like a fairytale right out of the Brother's Grimm. Some folks might find that sort of writing style outdated but I personally loved it. The only difficulties I had were that as the book continues, the gradual intensity and relentless flow of the plot becomes a bit exhausting. The novel also contained quite a few non sequiturs that often left me scratching my head, though perhaps that was intentional as it sort of fits with the dreamy quality of the novel. I mean, dreams are often full of seemingly random moments, though perhaps they're not so random on a subconscious level.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|One of our favorites and now we can have it on blu-ray. Excellent acting and wonderful stories by the screenwriter. Good for historical purposes, too. Servants are often overlooked but not in this movie!   UPDATED 2/22/2015: We still watch this movie often and love the music. Recently got the soundtrack off of iTunes. Great storyline and great acting. In fact, the acting isn't carried by one, two, or three characters but ALL of the cast. I could honestly say there were no heavyweights, each actor brought forth an excellent performance.

It seems so simple at first then you realize you have to plan more and more steps ahead to outwit that greedy little spider.  One problem I have encountered is with the hints.  When you click on hints they show them so fast I can't remember all the steps in order.  But even then I get so addicted I have to go back for more.
