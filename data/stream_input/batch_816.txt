2218922622|5.0|The Bescherelle is the must-have French verb conjugation book. It is used by French schoolkids so I was surprised when I saw that my French school in Paris used it for its (foreign) students. However, it is really the best verb conjugation book out there. It does not have the flip-to convenience of 501 French verbs, but once you get the hang of it (find your verb in the back, then flip to page with conjugation of \\"model\\" verb belonging to same family), it will become 2nd nature. At first I thought that this was a disadvantage; since you are looking at the conjugation of a model verb and not of the verb itself (unless it's the model verb whose conjugation you're looking for), you miss the visual component of memorization that you get with 501 FV, which has the full conjugation of each of its verbs. Since, I have found that this is an ADVANTAGE. Memorizing the conjugation of each French verb (the 501 approach) is daunting. Memorizing conjugation by \\"family,\\" i.e., associating the conjugation of related verbs, is MUCH EASIER. And unlike 501FV, Bescherelle allows you to find the conjugation of every French verb out there! 501 gives you decent coverage, but once you reach an intermediate level of French, you will find more and more verbs that are NOT in 501FV. I bought a variety of French books for study while I was in France, but left most of these behind when I came back to the States, including 501FV... but not the Bescherelle! I take it with me wherever I move, and since it's hardcover, it won't die on me anytime soon neither.
1596912863|3.0|This was a great quick read about a girl who lived part of her life in reality (has a job she doesn't quite like, and boyfriends she refers to as numbers instead of names) and part of her life in Pride and Prejudice fantasyland (where she is looking for her Mr. Darcy). She is bequeathed, in a relative's will, a trip to Pembrook Park.  Pembrook Park is a resort where female guests pretend to live in Jane Austen's time era (they have to talk the talk, live by the societal etiquittes of that day, wear the clothes, etc.)  At the resort are also actors who pretend to be the guests relatives and, hopefully, love interests.  In fact, one of the reasons some of these women go to Pembrook Park is to have forbidden love trysts (especially since they know there will be no strings attached).  Jane is reluctant to go, especially as she is not really looking for love; but she finds herself torn between two men, Martin (a gardener) and Mr. Nobley (a Mr. Darcy-like character).    One reason I thought the book was interesting was the fact that these actors were so in character throughout Jane's stay at Pembrook Park, it was hard to distinguish reality and acting.  In fact, Jane has this feeling as well.  It was interesting to see how deep the pretenses of Pembrook Park really reached (and to find out what was real and what was not).  Also, the author, in between each chapter, included brief summaries of each boyfriend (and the inbetween boys) that Jane encountered throughout her life.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|I've tried firmware upgrades and contacting the company via e-mail with no responses.  This happened when i bought batman begins and several other blu ray discs.  i know its my samsung because i used my pc(lite-on drive) and it plays fine.  Not very happy with my intro to blu ray so far,  hardware and software, I asked best buy why they dont put the warning on the outside of the packaging, but the employee played it off, one didnt even believe me that discs wont play.  They( software and hardware) really need to make sure i can at least watch the movie, I dont care about all the special features.  When I spend 2000 dollars to watch a movie, I better damn well be able to watch a movie.
B00007GZR5|5.0|The most difficult part was to project on film the original intent of the author. The scriptwriters and director couldn't have done it without a deep understanding of the afterlife and the natural principle of reincarnation. Kudo to the editor for \\"cutting\\" the scenes with master precision, and going back and forth showing the emotional aspect of humans and the evolution of the souls.<br /><br />Are we coming back to Earth to take conscious of the unconscious? Or are we going back to the \\"5th dimension\\" over & over again to re-evaluate our progress, as souls, and then make plans for the next reincarnation with our soul group? Could it be that the ultimate Divine plan is the reintegration of the souls with the Godhead?<br /><br />Some people accumulate a lot of toys and a lot of money in their lifetime on Earth ...and then, they die!<br />If there is no afterlife, why are we humans fighting so much the tribulations of life itself? Could it be perhaps that we have a lesson to learn in this short lifespan? Jesus Himself was teaching reincarnation to His Apostles. The message of Jesus the Essene was fairly simple to the initiated and, unfortunately, so distorted by Churchianity. What a shame!<br /> Are some Christians so blind as not being able to read the \\"Holy\\" Bible? Or, are they too busy listening to the babbling of the Bible thumpers?<br /><br />The children, as part of their soul group, also had some lessons to learn and teach. Albert is an old soul that reincarnated into the doctor's son, and Leona, another old soul, reincarnated as the daughter. (Projecting these two old souls with different skin colors was real genius)<br /><br />Everything in the known and unknown Universe is \\"vibration\\" pulsating at different rate of speed from the essence of God (or whichever name you want to give Him). Chris through persistence, courage, and tremendous Love, reached out to another vibration to help his soul mate back into the right path.<br /><br />Very well done Mr. Vincent Ward.
0446579939|4.0|Sparks delivers again with another great story with another set of great characters, who's stories all get intertwined and weaved together somehow yet again. I have to admit Sparks has a way of really getting you emotionally involved in his stories, and it's hard to put the book down until you've read cover to cover.    I don't wanna give anything away, but I have to say I was really impressed how Sparks developed and told his story this time making me care for the characters very early on, and I was actually almost shocked to see a \\"villain\\" this time around as well. I will admit a few characters and events seemed a little forced here and there, but I find that in a lot of his stories, so it just kinda goes with the territory. Regardless, I was sucked into the story and I enjoyed til the bitter end.    I do have to say this book really makes you think of things such as fate and destiny and whether or not they exist for people. I personally think they do and this story helps solidify that. I also have to say I actually expected a different ending than what we got...the ending I was expecting would of worked and satisfied me, but the one Sparks delivered gave me a little surprise and also satisfied. So it was a win-win.    A strong 4/5 for me.
1416575464|5.0|More often that not decorating books are just eye candy; after read them once you are satisfied but done. This is NOT the case with domino's first book. The domino team has managed to create a book that you will keep reading it again and again. It is simply brilliant!    Even though I have kept every issue of domino and go through them regularly, the book's format allows for a deeper approach to domino's mission. They have really worked hard to make the book into a usable tool. With more than just pretty pictures and stories, this book provides a framework for how to think about putting together a room (and yes their is new content).    I am only disappointed in two ways: 1, I wish the book referenced the issue each in which each room originally appeared and/or provided information about the products in each room. Perhaps there was not enough space, but access to information is one of my favorite parts of domino's monthly. 2, They also overlooked closets as room. And lets face it they have featured some stunning closets over the past few years.    Buy this book, you will NOT regret it!!!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I was very  happy with the movie. It came quickly. Well packaged and in good shape. I would definitely buy form here again.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Wow, awesome! Possibly the highest budget splatter flick in history! Jesus gets wrung out like there's no tomorrow: beaten, brutalized, mutilated, and nailed to a giant freakin' cross! Oh dude, you just have to see the instance where the cat-o-nine-tails gets caught in his ribs and the guy just pulls it back like he's starting a lawnmower. Classic! Passion Of The Christ would make Fulci proud. A brutally good time for the whole family! Splatteriffic!
B00005JLF5|5.0|It came quickly in good packaging. It was in great condition. My husband loved it. One of the best gifts I every bought him. Thank you for the great price and speedy service..
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I'm gonna give it 4 stars just because it's pretty close to what I expected to see and this is just the kind of movie that they made.  So for what it is, a very cartoony story and images, it's right on the spot.  My 12 year old son was barely interested, but he opted out of watching it to go play video games instead.  My 2 year old son was semi-interested.  My daughter and wife wouldn't even watch it.  I thought it was alright.  I like the picture and sound and it's a good movie to just have on in the background when only the 2-year old is home and he's fiddling around with toys in the room.  That's about it, I can't really slam it because it's pretty close to what I expected to see, and also what I'm sure they intended to make.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|THIS SOUNDTRACK IS PLAYED CONSTANTLY IN MY CAR AND I ALSO BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER & GRANDKIDS AND THEY LOVE IT AND PLAY IT CONSTANTLY.  IT BRINGS THE MOVIE (WHICH I ONLY GOT TO SEE SEVEN TIMES) BACK TO ME EACH TIME.  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DVD BUT WILL KEEP LISTENING TO THE SOUNDTRACK ANY TIME I'M IN THE CAR.
B001AR0D4A|2.0|I waited for years to see this made into a film , and had high hopes for it . but some idiot thought he knew better than the author of the story how it should end ! and by changing the ending totally ruined it ! why would you produce a rather decent film from a great story ,and then rip the very heart and soul from it ? this fool should never be allowed to produce another film !
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is a wonderful thought provoking game about learning space relationships enjoyed by our family and guests.  It doesn't take long to play, so you can have a conversation while having the challenge.
0380730367|3.0|My first of the Gennaro/Kenzie series, my 2nd Lehane novel. Lehane has a great reputation but after reading this and Shutter Island I have not yet been blown away. They both start off very strong but fail to deliver in the end. For \\"Prayers\\" I was disappointed in the direction of the 2nd half of the book. Starts off intruiging but plateaus and does not sustain the same level of suspense throughout. It was OK.
B001E95ZNI|4.0|If you don't mind a slow burn western, Appaloosa has much to admire. The acting by both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen is outstanding and the dialogue is believable for the most part. There is even some good humor thrown in, especially in the first half of the movie. While not as dark and gritty as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Ed Harris has created a western that never seems to be in a hurry. It has a nice relaxing feel to it, though the last half could have been trimmed up a bit. There isn't much action at all, and when there is, it is over in no time. Which is realistic (The real gunfight at the O.K. Corral was over in 30 seconds), but might not please the average person who paid $10.00 to see 3:10 to Yuma (2007 version) all over again.<br /><br />Appaloosa is often quiet, nicely acted, sometimes funny and well worth the time of any western fan.

0439813786|5.0|\\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" takes place in Paris, in the early 20th century. It tells the tale of an orphan named Hugo who secretely lives in a train station and fixes the clocks, unbeknownst to the stationmaster. Hugo is not just an ordinary boy however. In addition to his deftness with clocks, he also has a gift with all mechanical objects and spends much of his time stealing odds and ends from the toymaker's booth in order to fix up his personal pieces of clockwork. One such piece is a large mechanical man left to him by his father that has the capability of relating a mysterious message to him. Hugo is convinced that the message will be from his father beyond the grave and so he is obssessed with fixing the mechanical man any way that he can.   What makes this tale unique and proves Selznick's mastery at storytelling is the way in which he chooses to tell it. At first glance, the book is thick and daunting, especially to a child who is fearful of too many words on a page. This story however, is told half through words and half through pictures. Selznick's lively and touching drawings prove his talent as an artist and much of the story is gleaned through study of these pictures. While one could zip through the story in an hour, you wouldn't want to because so much can and should be absorbed through a careful study of his artwork.   I recommend this book highly to those who are interested in unique methods of storytelling as well as to those children who are simply not all that interested in books. While it might seem a cop out to give a child a book that is told largely through pictures I believe that it can be quite useful in helping children to feel confident in reading something that might at first glance appear too daunting to pick up. Studying such pictures can help to improve their attention to detail in a story as well as help them to feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Ages 9 and up.
B0000048CX|4.0|\\"Fakebook\\" is an album quite unlike any other in Yo La Tengo's catalog.  Putting aside their love of feedback and noise, the band settled into an album of mostly covers (with five originals-- including some previously recorded-- scattered throughout).  Welcoming back guitarist Dave Schramm from their debut [[ASIN:B0000036WF Ride the Tiger]] from an encore, the album of mostly folk and folky songs is smothered in acoustic guitars and slides.  And throughout, it's a fun listen.    This is evident straight from the opener, original \\"Can't Forget\\".  With a great steel guitar lead and a delicate male/female harmony vocal, the piece captures your attention and doesn't let go before wrapping up a couple minutes later.  The album pretty much continues in this vein, angular acoustics, hushed tones, and great steel guitar leads with occasional deviations ('50s rock and roll send up send up \\"Emulsified\\").  At it's best, it's filled with a whole lot of swaggering fun (\\"Griselda\\") or sensitivity (\\"Andalucia\\" and \\"Speeding Motorcyle\\").  And while there's no cuts that are cringe-worthy, there's a few don't really grab your attention (\\"You Tore Me Down\\", \\"Oklahoma, U.S.A.\\").    All in all though, \\"Fakebook\\", while not exactly a sign of what Yo La Tengo is about given its concept, is a great record from their catalog. Newcomers would be best off starting with one of their more representative albums ([[ASIN:B0000036X3 I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One]] comes to mind), but this one is well worth the investment. Recommended.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Loved the movie. love it on blu ray!! The visuals are varied and this is the type of movie worthy of being on blu ray. It is now more entertaining to stay at home w/ 7.1 surround sound and a good blu ray movie than it is going to the theater...far better visuals and as good or better sound at home !!<br />Definitely worth buying if you have the set up.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Amon Amarth once again doesn't disappoint with \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\".  Every song chugs and moves along like a Viking horde stampeding across a village leaving nothing standing behind them....from start to finish it is another epic piece to Amon Amarth's discography and will not fail to please fans in the least.  \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" is the 7th full length and is still Amon Amarth at a healthy and motivated state....still marching strong swinging their big metal axe.  \\"THOR...ODEN'S SON...PROTECTOR OF MANKIND...RIDE TO MEET YOUR FATE...YOUR DESTINY AWAITS!!!\\"  Will not disappoint and will keep any hardcore fan with a smile upon their faces...a must have....try to get the bobbleheads too they're high quality and a great collector's item.
B001DJ7PQ4|3.0|I have copies of Dr. Who back to the original 1963 Doctor and the \\"new\\" series has indeed sparked some of the best episodes ever. But... The chemistry between Donna and the Doctor, as with Martha and the Doctor, just falls a little flat. Very good actresses, some great stories, but somehow just doesn't make this a five star season. Yes the series is changing and we now know more about how lonely a Timelord's life can be; but like \\"Scarlett\\" did nothing for \\"Gone With The Wind\\", sending \\"a\\" Doctor off to Rose falls flat. Better to have left it hanging. Having Rose \\"calling\\" the Doctor and showing up now and then was FANtastic, but why? Martha shows up for UNIT. Could have been better.  Each element: the acting, the writing, the music, the settings are GREAT, but somehow they just don't seem to flow together like they did in the first two seasons. It faltered a bit in season three and more so in season four.   As a fan, I WILL be buying season four one day. But a dozen episodes for $100 (discounted to $65)? Just too expensive for a three star season. I'll wait. If it doesn't drop, I'll just watch the TV versions I recorded.   I am intrigued as to what other extras might be included. Torchwood season 1 had commentary on EVERY episode yet season 2 had none (on the set I bought). What will be included here to justify the $100 SRP?
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I was expecting that I would only like the hit single \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" when I got this CD.  Little did I know that that was one of the weakest songs of the album.  I figured that \\"Ur So Gay\\" would be one of the worst songs on the album, but it's actually one of the better ones.  It's really amazing that Perry was able to blend such enthusiasm and talent with styles from the sixties, eighties, and today to make an interesting album.<br /><br />The best song on the album is \\"I'm Still Breathing\\", a ballad, which is so gorgeously written, even though it is a bit depressing.  I think the word poetic would not be misused on this song.<br /><br />The album is fun, and not to be missed!  Don't just go into it expecting it to suck because you either liked or hated the first song.  It's actually a lot more complex than the one song.  It's an experience that you will not regret having had.
0440238609|5.0|This is one of the most original fantasies I have read in a long time. I found it a good read. The first book is by far the best of the three. However, I think parents should read them first before deciding to give them to their children. These are very dark stories. The first book alone includes murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, torture, and betrayal.  It is hard to know who is the good guy, and who is the villain. It is also openly anti-church (not that I had a problem with that, but some people might).  It is interesting that Pullman, an atheist, has written a trilogy that is actually profoundly spiritual.  The positive themes (yes, there are some) include friendship, loyalty, honor, cleaning up messes ( both the ones you have made and those of others ), keeping your word, and generally trying to do the right thing. Pullman presents a different concept of \\"soul\\" than has previously been explored.  All in all this is a thought-provoking work, and worth the read, but I would say NOT suitable for younger children.
B000000I3O|5.0|I have both of the misfits collection cds and this one is my favorite. Its got a great list of songs and the sound may not sound as good on some songs its still good. One cool thing about collection 2 is the lyrics. But you just can't go wrong with this one.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is simply put, quality work!  I enjoyed every episode.  I didn't want it to end.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is an excellant Cd.  If you liked the movie you will love this.  I just sing right along.
B00002ZMNW|5.0|This is one of Metallica's best concert tapes around.  With the addition of the San Francisco Symphony, it added a new dimenion to Metallica's music.  It added more power and depth.  Great Job, Metallica!!!  I would love to see more bands like Metallica do this.  It really adds a new dimenion to any rock band.
0375826726|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading Brisingr and I loved it! I am always amazed at the amount of talent oozing out of this young author (I can't believe he is around my age....it boggles my mind!).<br /><br />Contrary to some reviews, I found the plot to be riveting enough to keep me entertained with  twists and turns to make me gasp at all the right moments.  All of the characters were true to the two previous books, and we even got to explore some characters further. All in all, the writing was fantastic as usual, the story was engrossing, and the emotions of the characters felt true-to-life. I can't wait for the last installment in this wonderful cycle!
B0000009SY|4.0|For me, and I speak for no one but me, this is an album about the first amendment.  I tend to refuse to read other reviews about anything I review, though I do occasionally do it.  For this, I have honestly not looked at another review.  I only know that there are a ton and a half of 5 star reviews.  All in all, this is a great album.  It shows what happens when we let others decide what is right for us to listen to.  There are many classic songs here.  Come on, how can you not love \\"catholic girls\\", \\"crew slut\\", \\"dong work for yuda\\",  \\"why does it hurt when i pee\\" or the \\"central scrutinizer\\" itself?<br />I think if one really listens to this album, one cannot help but love it.  It is a smidge campy, but all great music.  This is Jazz Fusion and Zappa at a 10+.  Enjoy it.
B001DHXT20|5.0|This is part of the incredible superhero movies of the summer. First off it was iron man and that movie created a standard above all others. This film exceeded the expectations and blow up everything that the other film had done. This movie will make everyone feel like they are a kid again.
1438242816|1.0|I am so disappointed. Being a fan of classic literature I was looking forward to reading Pride & Prejudice. But what I got was moderately-well written chick lit.  Think of Pride and Prejudice as the Bridgit Jones of the 18th Century.<br /><br />The story-line is predictable - you know how the whole novel is going to play out after the first couple of pages. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that there would be some little twist. Maybe Jane would end up with Darcy, or something a little more interesting. Unfortunately not.<br /><br />I honestly think Austen was writing a parody of women.  The only concern of every female character in the book is to get married to a rich, well-to-do gentleman.  Of course, some will argue that Elizabeth is different, but as she states herself, her interest in Darcy is only aroused when she sees what a wonderful estate he owns and considers that she may be the lady of it. Each of the female characters are shallow, self-centred (Jane excepted) and vacuous.<br /><br />On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting - Mr. Bennet is amusing, and Darcy started out being intriguing before turning into a school girl-like idiot.<br /><br />Perhaps, if you're a fan of straight-down-the-line, predictable romantic (semi comedic at times) novels then you might enjoy this.  But don't expect to find a masterful tale, expertly told.  Unfortunately that is what I was expecting (it being a \\"classic\\" and all) and I was totally disappointed.  I really think this is one of the worst books I have ever read.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The story was different and if you like the supernatural then you should enjoy this movie.  They do speak in whispers through out the movie so you might have to turn up the sound. But otherwise the sound quality is good.  My only really problem is the digital copy.  If you have a Mac you can't download the digital copy of the movie. Also the digital copy is in standard definition.  Ok this is one of those movies that is a cult type movie with its cult following but Guys in the studio distribution center stop being so cheap. If you are to make a Blu Ray out of the movie at least do it right and make this digital copy useful for everyone and in the same definition as the movie purchased (In Wide Screen).  You are charging at least $18.00 for this movies purchasing price depending where you get it.  That should always be part of the purchase and you wonder why people download movie by pirating, be a little more giving and more people would buy more. I do remind you that this movie was already released to dvd before so you are just milking it.
B001BJ690Y|5.0|Welcome to the incredible world of Blu-ray movies.  Only to be completely appreciated with the sum of all necessary components to carry this technology off!!    My Qualifying Statement:  I have a HD Home Theater weighing in at about $2000 plus movies.  A break down is; a Mitsubishi HD Projector (HC-1500) $800 (orig $1495), a Sony 5.1 Sound System (HT-SS2300) $399 (orig $499) and a Sony PLAYSTATION 3 with Blu-ray player $399 (orig $499).  Sony High Speed HDMI Cables $150 (orig $180) and a HD Screen Paint and kit $180 for my 108\\" viewing wall screen.  With this True HD 1080p system I've assembled a HD Home Theater presentation sight and sound equal to an IMAX (on a smaller scale) presentation.    With this consideration and background information provided I can now comment on the Blu-ray version of KILL BILL Volume 1.  Presented in the FULL HD 1080p (1920x1080 lines) 5.1 Dolby Cinema Sound format (5 speaker plus Subwoofer) we can now completely enjoy Quentin Tarantino genius in this complex action packed well executed, perfectly cast, Directed, and written critically acclaimed film.      Uma Thurman is \\"The Bride\\", the Ultimate Revenging Samurai Warrior. She is perfectly cast, period.     This Blu-ray presentation is total eye candy and the musical Sound Track is the perfect accompaniment to the action. A must see!!!!    I've had this Blu-ray movie for 1 week and I have watched it 3 times.  The replay value is endless.  Tarantino has created the perfect masterpiece.  (and this is only Volume 1)    Bonus Material: Only 480p (w/HDMI) but the 22 min Making of KILL BILL doc is worth the viewing and the 6 min music video of the Singing Group 5,6,7, 8's is cute.  Finally Tarantino film trailers.    Bottomline:  Remember the Blu-ray experience is HDMI (1080p) 5.1 Sound in a HD Home Theater (the bigger the screen the better).  Enjoy.  This is a keeper with many encore performances to be had.    P.S. - Volume 1 ends setting us up perfectly for Volume 2 (I can't wait!!!)
B0015AARJI|5.0|I'm so glad that I got the Dual Shock 3 controllers!!!  This is the way PlayStation games should be played. If you play Madden and are not using these controllers, you're cheating yourself.  They only weigh a few ounces more, which is expected, and they work great!!! I got 'em in 3 days, thanks Amazon.com!
B000001ELP|5.0|This is a great album.  If this were any other band, no one would complain.  Problem is, KISS released this.  Everyone has this idea of what KISS should sound like.  If you listen to the album, and forget who wrote and sang it, this is a very good album.  Regardless, this is an awesome listen.  A concept album concerning a \\"boy\\" who has to \\"save the world\\".  How can you not love it?  I had used lyrics from this album to just pass on to one of my brothers and a couple of his friends when we would chat on IM and just use them as \\"what do you think of this? let's discuss these lines.\\"  They loved the symbolism of it all.  Then I would say \\"this is KISS\\" and they would be shocked.<br />This is a smart album.  Not to say KISS fans are dumb (myself being a big KISS fan), but you have to really look at this album on a different level to truly appreciate it.  This isn't your typical rock n roll album.  It does make you think a little, use your imagination.  Listen to this album as if you were a little naive, a little into fantasy, and you'll love this.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Gripping tale of two men laying everything on the line for what they believe in. Well-acted by the two leads Russell Crowe as a whistle-blowing former tobacco company executive Jeffrey Wigand, and Al Pacino as maverick \\"60 Minutes\\" producer Lowell Bergman, plus a superb performance by Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace. Overwrought at times but Director Michael Mann successfully maintains a creepy, claustophobic atmosphere throughout, reflecting the pressure and scrutiny on Wigand. Excellent use of music and lighting as well. An usually critical look at big business for a mainstream American non-fiction film.
031606792X|1.0|I'm rating this book a 1 star because I'm a fan of the Twilight series.  Perhaps if this worked as a standalone, and I didn't come in with great (or even \\"New Moon\\" level) expectations for the book, it would've left a better impression on me.    This book started out quite well... but it doesn't take long before the author suddenly, as if she's purposely trying to ruin the book, jumps the shark.  It's as if she forgot that she was writing a vampire/human love story, and decided to turn completely sci-fi/horror.  Gone was the weak and lovestruck, but ultimately lovable Bella.  Instead, we got a girl whose motivations could no longer be identified with (It also doesn't help that this is precisely when Meyer chooses to start telling the story through Jacob's eyes).  Once the connection with Bella is broken, the reader is left hanging outside the plot, wondering how it was possible for a series so addictive to abruptly cut the bond between Bella and the reader.    Meyer does not ever recover from that disconnect, even though she puts in a good effort.  We do get a better look at Edward through Jacob's more sensible eyes, but it does not make up for the loss of Bella, or the complete absurdity of the entire plot.    All in all, I wish Meyer never wrote this book.  Books 1-3 were perfect.  She should have left them that way.  But if you're a fan of the series, you probably can't resist reading this anyway.  Be warned:  You're going to be devastatingly heart-broken about being forced to witness the complete downfall of an otherwise extraordinarily compelling series.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|quit making albums! this is awful! metallica have sucked from the black album till today! cliff burton made this band what they were!<br /><br />i'll agree with a buddy of mine and say that all the talent in this band died on the bus.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Despite being an avid online shopper, I've never reviewed anything online before. I felt compelled to do it now because of the mediocre critical reviews this movie received. To someone who never saw the cartoon series I'm sure this movie was disjointed, confusing, and drawn out. To an adult who sat in front of the TV screen at the age of eight with a homemade cardboard steering wheel, following Speed's every adventure, this movie was sheer heaven. It exceeded every expectation - action, good vs. evil, twists and turns (and spins, flips and crashes) - it never let me down. The subtle nuances gleaned out of the series (the poses, fight scenes, facial expressions, etc.) proved this movie was crafted by people who knew and enjoyed the TV series. My sons are only 5 and 3 - I'll wait a couple of years - but I can't wait until they're old enough to experience it. A sincere 'thank you' to the people who brought one of my favorite childhood memories to life!
B00192KCQ0|2.0|These guys are lucky, because people easily get hyped when they feel the guys are making \\"noisy music\\" again, despite later half of their releases are fantastically boring. Now I forgot the name, but the singer is quite talented in leading people into very deep sleep. Yes, this album is \\"loud\\", just like pittyful st. anger. Yes, the vocal is not trying what doesn't belong to him anymore, yet also not trying what made people support them to build what they are. If they say there are some improvements in their latest attempt, it should also be some insult to the other bands who struggled and created masterpieces only to gain not enough rewards. Maybe helpful to the people who are suffering from insomnia, or have a dual with a friend in enduring upto third track.

B001FTTY48|4.0|'Death Magnetic', like 'Metallica', is sure to be an album that many will love, and many will hate. With the release of 'Metallica' many of the early Metallica fans justifiably felt abandoned like a new-born baby at the front door of a fire station. Will 'Death Magnetic' make the later Metallica fans feel abandoned in the same way? Hard to say, but they certainly won't have the legitimate grievance that the early fans had, as 'Death Magnetic' is for the most part a progressive return to Metallica's roots. And with the release of 'Death Magnetic' these early Metallica fans are now going to be the beneficiaries of a near total reversal of fortunes.<br /><br />However, whether you're an early or later Metallica fan you should know one thing going in; 'Death Magnetic' was not written for you. In an interview James made it clear that Metallica must evolve, move forward, follow their inner compass, and write music that they like, not what they think the fans might possibly like. He explained that if they were to be untrue to themselves and simply write what they hope Metallica fans might like, instead of what they like, the fans would in effect become the artist, not them.<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering what the title 'Death Magnetic' means? Well, in short, it basically means that much like a magnet pulls and attracts, some people are attracted to, obsess over and are exceedingly fascinated by death. When you are young, death is something that you really don't think about that much. However, when you get to your mid 40's, like the members of Metallica, it is a subject that crosses your mind with ever increasing frequency. James stated that death is the common thread that runs through this album. However, it's certainly not an omnipresent thread, which I definitely see as a good thing.<br /><br />After 15 mostly successful years, producer Bob Rock and Metallica have parted ways. Consequently, producer extraordinaire Rick Rubin was brought on board for 'Death Magnetic'. Rick quickly made his mission statement clear. He wanted 'Death Magnetic' to have the \\"essence\\" of 'Master Of Puppets'. James said this was a good idea in theory, but an impossible task in reality, as again, Metallica is a band that must evolve and look forward, not backwards. Nevertheless, they understood and appreciated what Rick was hoping to achieve.<br /><br />So, what's the end result? You'll surely want to judge for yourself, but it's clear that compromises were conceded, fruitful middle ground was found, and then viciously plundered. 'Death Magnetic' is unlike any single Metallica album, but contains characteristic elements that span Metallica's entire career. 'Death Magnetic' is a triumphant amalgamation of everything Metallica was, with everything they are, and is a true progression of the band's sound. And I really don't see how anyone could ask for anything more than that!his mission statement clear. He wanted 'Death Magnetic' to have the \\"essence\\" of 'Master Of Puppets'.

B0000X61UU|5.0|This workout is one of the best I have ever owned. I do a DVD daily and I have quite the collection.  This one works your muscles in new ways, reshapes your body, and is also fun to do. I feel like I get the best workout when I am drenched in sweat, but with this tape there is no need because the cardio at the beginning is just enough when combined with the weight training. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to jaz up there current routine with something totally different.
0930289234|2.0|Obviously, Watchmen was a landmark achievement.  The narrative complexity, the \\"realism\\" and the more-thoughtful-than-average consideration of what superheroes would do to the world were they to really exist all make Watchmen shine.<br /><br />But if you peel away all of the glamor and try and figure out what the work is really about, what it really says, you'll be disappointed.  The self-destructive nature of man that sets the stage for the whole drama, as expressed by the imminent apocalypse, may have been convincing in 1985 but after the fall of the Soviet Union, it's hard to buy in to.  History sure seems to have sided with the United States.  The nuclear stand-off ended peacefully.  Perhaps Moore is mocking those who thought that there could be no peaceful resolution.  Given his other views and works (re conspiracy theories, cia secret missions) it seems he really bought into it.  I'm sorry for him that he didn't have a chance to say, \\"I told you so.\\"<br /><br />As a student of physics, the made-up science stuff always makes me cringe and Dr Manhattan was no exception.  When I understood that Moore introduced Dr Manhattan as a way to ask the question, \\"What would a truly SUPER hero do to global politics?\\" I was more forgiving.  When I realized that all he wanted to say was that all political entities should always have exactly equal powers, my stomach started to turn again.<br /><br />Dramatically, though, I think that the total suspension of the physical laws of nature for Dr Manhattan while everyone else was bound to all that and more (psychic shock wave??? come on!) made for a fundamentally unbelieavable story.  A bit of suspended disbelief is expected but having two sets of rules for the universe simultaneously operating and affecting one and other??? Of course, he has artistic license but then again, I have the ability to stop caring about the story when it becomes too ridiculous.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING<br />So, was Ozymandias right? Why would a momentary external threat erase millenia of conflict between people?  Ozymandias' plan was supposedly going to end all conflict including the simple inter-personal street conflicts taking place on the street.  He is presented as \\"the smartest man in the world\\" and then has this infantile naive idea of how to solve the worlds' problems a la the gordian knot.  No justification is given for how one small catastrophe could so easily change human nature.  And yet, Ozymandias and Dr Manhattan, the characters that have been presented as being wiser than all others think that it would work.  If Moore meant to mock everyone in his universe, then I agree.  But if he really buys into this drivel, and it seems that he does, the ideas that he is presenting are SO childish and ridiculous, they are insulting to be exposed to.<br /><br />The beginning of Watchmen showed great promise.  Fascinating characters, a sort of puzzle--piecing together all of the heroes' pasts, some intelligence, fun references, detailed images.  But the story gets more and more ridiculous and when Moore starts to actually reveal what the real story is, the reader is hit with a two-headed attack: [1] he has had to go through so many suspensions of disbelief that he doesn't really care anymore and [2] the \\"real story\\" is so patently absurd that the reader wishes he hadn't discovered it.<br /><br />One might claim that I \\"didn't get it.\\"  I just think that ultimately, there isn't much in it to get.  And what there is is either obvious or obviously stupid.  Maybe I should re-read it.  Frankly, I regret having read it once.<br /><br />If you're interested in the issues broached in Watchmen, about superheros in the real world and don't want to feel insulted and bored by the end of the work, don't waste your time with this drivel.  Just watch \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  (If you must waste as much time as it took me to read this book, watch it a few times.  And maybe throw in \\"Batman Begins\\" as well.)  Nolan obviously was influenced by Watchmen but created a much finer, more intelligent and less painful-to-experience work of art.
031606792X|3.0|I haven't finished reading breaking dawn yet and I'm not that excited about finishing it. This is really disappointing because It took me less than a week to finish reading the first three books in the saga.  Breaking dawn is so disturbing! She should've just added a few more chapters to Eclipse to end the story. or she could've at least waited a few more years to come up with something better. How could the editors and publisher agree to the destruction of a wonderful saga?   I REALLY hope the story will be redeemed in the movies. I'm hoping they'll take a different route there and change the ending.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is a great book and really wraps up the Twilight series well. The book ties up all the loose ends in the other three books and really leaves you wanting more (shouldn't a good book do that?). In my opinion this book was well written and deserves five stars. No matter what other people say Stephenie Meyer did what was wanted from her true fans.     This book was really intersting when it came to Bella's immortality. In fact, the story had two plotlines. In the first half of the book, the romance and Bella's want for immortality are the predominant themes throughout. When she has Edward's baby though, everything changes. She barely survives which in itself was a huge struggle but when she is saved by Edward's quick thinking she reawakens as a vampire. To me it seemed like the book was closing up because of Bella's worry free lifestyle. She takes to being a vampire so well that there are no problems for her. It left me wanting more and I was not disappointed.    The second half of the book was more violent and combat based. Bella was learning to fight and use her ability. I really like to see her not a helpless little human anymore. With her newfound vampire ability she could protect herself and those around her. No longer was she just a pawn in a vampire world. She could defend herself and wasn't as breakable. This gave me immense satisfaction. Meyer also wrapped up the struggle with Jacob well. When he imprinted on Renesmee it first seemed like a bad thing but really it was the easiest way for everyone to be happy. Jacob didn't have his heart broken and Bella and Edward would not be pestered by him (at least not through his love for Bella. Edward is a biy irritated by his love for Renesmee). All in all, it was wrapped up nicely and all te questions were answered. The only thing I would have liked to see more of was Bella's taking to immortality. A little more fun with her new body would have been nice to read about and i really enjoyed the few times shereally let loose and let herslef experience her new self. Still, a great book and I recommend it to anyone who remotely likes to read.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I really like Coldplay's new CD Viva La Vida.  All the songs are very good.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I'll start with disc 3 of this set, it contains songs filmed in Atlanta in the next to the last night of the end of the tour. I was at the show and after the huge storm passed over the show went off without a hitch. Rush played perfect as usual, they were filming the show in HD the camera guys told us for an upcoming dvd, well this is that dvd. I'm sure some people even Rush fans will complain about how much of this dvd is comprised of live versions of songs from their latest cd Snakes and Arrows. And yes perhaps there were 1 or 2 to many that you would rather have and older song being played, but looking back on it now the newer songs are strong and hold up well in comparison to the classic hits. The video intro (spoiler alert)!..........by the boys from the South Park t.v. show for Tom Sawyer is a concert highlight and not to be missed. Rush also plays Passage to Bangkok which is also a \\"high\\" point of the dvd/concert. This dvd has way to many songs to play for you (as Geddy is fond of saying at the concerts)and the bottom line is this, if your a Rush fan your going to love this dvd, if your a casual fan this would be a great one to buy as songs from all the eras of Rush are represented here. If your not a Rush fan but maybe curious what all the hype is about check this out it's a great catching up point. 5 star rating and yes Rush still rocks hard after all these years! Thanks for reading.
0385338724|4.0|Enjoyable chic-lit, in the vein of Bridge Jones Diary. Plucky British working woman, trying to find love and happiness, confused about who the right man is.    The book does raise the issue of what kind of person you are, whether you are defined by your memories, your actions, your past, your intentions.  But it doen't hit you over the head with it.

I LOVED THIS ALBUM.....People need to stop comparing people to other people.....This is JHUD no Whitney, Aretha, Patti or anyone else for that matter.   Pocketbook-is the song you play in the morning to hype yourself up for the day!!! Or play before going out for that night.   Giving Myself--if you have ever been in real love, then you will love this one.   You pulled me through--is a great dedication to that one friend or love one that helped you pull out of your situation rather it's death of a love one, depression, a lost love, or a break up.   I'm his only woman---I think I heard Effie at the beginning of this song...lol...Just too fierce!!!!!  Can't stop the rain--You really have to listen to this song...it tells such a powerful story  We Gon' Fight--I can't even say enough about this one!!!!

B001GAPC1K|5.0|I know a little bit about Blu-ray but I am not an expert on it, however, movies look much better if they are Blu-ray compared to upconverting DVDs. As for the movie, it combines all the elements of great comic books: smart, fun, plenty of action, and an intriguing story line; these movie elements are put into a cage together until they make babies, of these babies, only the aesthetically pleasing one is removed while the other chimera are put up for adoption or put to sleep. Iron Man is the baby they kept.
B000W4D94I|5.0|As my title mention, this movie is a definite must have.  I have always been a tornado enthusiast and this is as close to the real thing as you can get.      Where I live, we recently experienced the magnitude of a real twister first hand.  Although the twister that swept through here was rated an F2 tornado, the damage was extreme (one can only imagine the devastation of the infamous F5 twister in the movie).      Rick
B00065MDRW|3.0|Bought this for a couple of the songs on it.  The quality is not what I expected, but that wasn't what I was after. I wanted this for stricly nostalgic reasons and for that I did get what I was after.  Would I recomend it? From a quality stand point, no, but if you are just after the memory of the time, then go for it.

But if you are into the whole 80's action movie genre then this would suit your tastes.

0743455967|4.0|I found King's memoir on the craft of writing On Writing more inspirational than instructional (a good thing) though he does spend quite a bit of time addressing the deadly overuse of the adverb (ah, there's one now) in beginning writer's work.  Reading about King's struggles to write and to publish amidst his struggles to live serve to remind writers that we can overcome the challenges we face in life and use them to inform our writing.  King fans interested in how writers work, find motivation, and especially in King's life will find On Writing interesting.  King doesn't try to pretend his life - the good and the bad - is anything other than what it is.  His honesty is disarming.  Enough so it may capture some new fans for King's fiction.  Writers and readers a lot can get something from On Writing.
0321525655|5.0|To say \\"Presentation Zen\\" is the best book on creating an effective presentation since Jerry Weissman's \\"[[ASIN:0131875108 Presenting to Win: The Art of Telling Your Story]]\\" is an understatement. What Garr Reynolds' book accomplishes is to furnish presenters with the tools to make presentations fun and enjoyable again.<br /><br />Armed with an arsenal against the use of bullets and an army of arguments for the use of compelling visuals, Reynolds walks the talk by making his own book very visually oriented, starting with the presentation-based preface by Guy Kawasaki.<br /><br />After reading it, I was able to transform a presentation I was going to deliver later this month, packing the essentials of my pitch into 7 slides, none of which had bullets and most of which contained powerful visuals that support the story I will be telling the audience. This change was possible thanks to the advice on this book, so I highly recommend it to any presenter or teacher who wants to breathe life into a presentation.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Carpenter's classic with Kurt Russell playing a short mean Clint Eastwood with an eye patch (ala John Wayne), Lee Van Cleef as the warden and a cast that includes Ernest Borgine, Adrienne Barbeau, Isaac Hayes and Harry Dean Stanton.  Let us not forget Donald Pleasance at the President of the United States. (\\"You're the Duke, you're A no. 1!\\") Manhatten as a prison, a downed Air Force One and Snake Plisken sent in to effect a rescue and return before impacted explosive charges blow his head off.  Eerie night shooting in a burned out section of St. Louis subbing for New York and an effective Carpenter score.  A classic.
B000V86OKG|5.0|If you liked Dexter: Season 1, you will love the second season.  More killing of killers and bad people is what Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is all about. All the while, he has to live a \\"normal\\" life with his girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz). But the introduction of a new seductress by the name of Lila (Jaime Murray) and the ever-present Sargeant Doakes (Erik King) will keep Dexter on his toes from the very first episode of the season. Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), Dexter's sarcastic, swearing, fellow-cop coworking sister will make anybody laugh. Dexter: Season 2 is well worth your time to watch, and is a worthy addition to anybody's DVD collection!
0375826726|2.0|If you thought Eldest was average, wait till you start reading this one.    It's amazing, Eragon comes across as a bumbling buffoon, not able to make his mind up about thing after the other.  He needs be on medication like the author!    Eragon's success has gone to Paolini's head, and he's written a self serving novel of length.  There is very little story, character development or emotional attachment. The novel drags on even more slowly than Eldest.  The eragon series has been called the \\"Jedi\\" copy for a right reason.  All the star wars movies are pretty much on auto pilot and devoid of emotion.  I think since mid-way through Eldest, Chrisopher Paolini's has been the same.    The only reason I didn't throw it in the bin within 1 hour of starting reading was because I had invested in the first two novels!
1592402690|5.0|I read a tremendous amount and haven't read a book through twice since I was 13.  I cannot recommend this book any higher for a Beatles fan.  This is an incredible read with so many gems.  My favorite quote from a good friend who read the book: \\"So what were you doing at 19?  This guy was engineering REVOLVER.\\"    There are so many gems in this book that you'll find yourself going back many times just to reread how a recording was done.  I'm a musician, but this will be a great read for any fan of the Beatles.  To hear how they recorded things back then with such limited equipment and with some pretty insane politics at the recording company EMI gave me a much greater appreciation of just how the Beatles broke the mold.  Geoff was the unsung hero of these albums and is humble in his recounting of the recording sessions.    I couldn't recommend this book any higher.  If you're bothering to read this you are definitely a Beatles fan, and you need to buy this book!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Historical dark comedy about Cold-War-Era America and the Age of the Atom. Fantastic film... a must own.
B000NJVWTQ|5.0|This is an absolute neccessity to any big APP fan.  The Gaudi album remastered superbly plus a bunch of cool bonus tracks.  These include demos, backing tracks, etc.  The original album was very short, only 7 songs but all very good if not excellent.  But now you have all the bonus tracks that more than make up for the short playing time of the original.  Get this and use your original as a coaster or a frisbee, because after you hear this one you'll never play the original again.  4 stars for the album.  5 stars for the remastering and bonus tracks.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|What can you say?  This was one of the first movies I wanted on Blu-Ray.  And I was not disappointed.  It wasn't the first Blu-Ray I bought, but when I saw the deal on Amazon I had to get it.
B0000640VO|5.0|I watched Amelie on DVD several years ago for fun, and really enjoyed it. Then a few weeks ago I finally ordered my own DVD and watched it again. It's great to watch even a second time thru, probably because it's hard to catch everything the first time. And that's because many of the good parts of Amelie are very brief, especially in the first 20 minutes or so when Amelie's childhood & teenhood are shown in a pretty fast pace. Just like how the official summary of the movie describes Amelie, she is \\"painfully shy\\" but also playful & enthusiastic with her eccentric hobbies, like skipping stones (as well as \\"stealing\\" nice skipping stones throughout the movie XD), and helping people out.<br /><br />As for the content of the movie, the story has some elements of intrigue & mystery, and with the shy-yet-mischievous Amelie character wanting to do things in her indirect ways, a lot of light-hearted action takes place while these little \\"mysteries\\" are solved. Overall it starts off as a comedy, with bits of adult content (brief showings of nude breasts & non-explicit sex scenes), a few fun fantasy elements like inanimate photos & animal-objects talking to her, and gradually turns into a light, adorable romantic comedy in the 2nd half. She and her love interest are based on a curious crush on each other, with their main goal being to simply find out more of each other, without meeting, yet. XD (As opposed to typical romantic comedies where the main characters hook up, fight, get back together, have dramas, then FINALLY get back together.)<br /><br />Another thing to note about this movie is the presentation. The style is very artistically composed, with colors being selected & saturated to get an almost toy-like world in some scenes. The various characters have distinct personalities, from an obnoxiously bossy vendor to a quiet, wise painter.<br /><br />Overall, people who are tired of typical romantic comedies will like how eccentric this movie is. Shy/quiet people will relate to Amelie's interests & personality, as this is a very \\"character-driven\\" movie.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|It wasn't too long ago that the new series of Doctor Who started up, and before that day, I had only heard of the show in passing. I gave it a shot, and coming from a clean slate, I found I loved the show and have been watching it even since. One of the things that really captivated me about the show was anything was possible. You could be watching an epic space battle one episode, then on to meeting Shakespeare in the next. All the while, the show delivers on comedy and even some drama, the show is definitely a step higher in that department from what I have heard and seen since I started watching this show compared to the original.    A basic summary of your average episode would be that the Doctor and his current companion(s) travel through time and space, sometimes visiting famous events and helping out the locals with and alien related problems they might have. David Tennant has done a remarkable job in his acting, always coming up with odd yet funny quotes to relate to the situation.    One thing that I imagine might turn people away from buying this is the price tag. Compared to most other shows, it costs 2-3 times as much, but if you are a fan of the show or even have just seen a few and like it, I have found that I have been rewatching the episodes over and over again. Now season 4 isn't out yet, but in my opinion, the show is continuing on as strong as ever, even with fairly regular cast replacement, most new characters I have found to be just as good if not better than the last.
B000NJVWU0|5.0|Out of all APP's albums, this one probably needed remastering the most.  Now it sounds awesome and makes the original completely disposable.  There's also 7 bonus tracks of demos and unreleased tracks.  There's even a track from the never released album, \\"The Sicilian Defence\\".  If you are a big APP fan this is a must.  3 and 1/2 for the album and  a solid 5 for the remastering and bonus cuts.

Anyways the movie of course. ^^  Its a great comedy, very dark, very elegant, and very disturbing at some points. If your similar to me a normal person and like to collect certain movies like edward scissor hands, beetlejuice, the goonies and such then this one is for your collection! I enjoyed it when I was a kid and enjoy just as much now! Its still got it. Goes to show you how vengefully crazy some people can get, and how very fragile we actually are.
B00012QM9K|5.0|This is without a doubt the single most important film of my time. I am 35 years old, and I fancy myself a movie freak. I am not a Jew; in fact I am an Atheist and a very proud one. I mention this because if you read my first sentence, you probably deduced that I was a religious person, thus driving me to make such an impactfull comment about this film. I say this film is the most important film I have ever seen because it shows the ignorance of mankind in its most raw form, bloodshed, on an un-imaginable scale. As silly as it is for a human being to believe in an imaginary old man up in the sky, or living in you chest if you prefer, will save you when you die only if you denounce all other imaginary old men living in the sky while worshiping that particular one, it is just as easy for a group of mislead sheep to attempt to wipe out a race of human beings. Definitely not one of mankind's finest hours. This is a wonderful account of TWO men making a huge difference and saving lives, regardless of the consequences. That's right i said TWO men, because when i discuss this film with other's, they can never tell me who Itzhak Stern is. If it wasn't for him, the list would probably have never been. \\"The list is life\\".
B000NJVWUA|5.0|I'll be brief.  It was a 4 star album to begin with.  Now it's nothing less than 5 stars.  This new expanded remaster sounds so much better than the original.  There is no comparison.  The real draw though, is a treasure trove of vocal demos, backing tracks, orchestral overdubs, etc.  It's an absolute must for any big APP fan.  Get this one and throw your original copy away.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|When I purchased this movie, I was still using my Sony XBR Rear Projection HDTV and PS3 for Blu-Ray.  It was a nice picture.  Since then, I purchased a Samsung 46\\" 605 Series Flat Screen.  This has the 120 hz capability which turns 60 frames into 120 frames and is smooth as ice.  This movie is so realistic.  Even if you don't have the up to date equipment it's still a great blu-ray movie.
B00005AREQ|4.0|Blow by Blow -  The CD is what I remember from the past, which is what I was wanting.      After listening to the CD, I realized that I used to LOVE the LIVE version of some of these tunes... and so, I bought the Jeff Beck/Jan Hammer LIVE CD.    Blow by Blow is a studio recording which I find a little \\"dry\\" when compared to the energy of the LIVE CD... But it's still Jeff Beck!
B00006AW2O|5.0|12 X 5 was a classic Rolling Stones album. Many of the songs are covers, but there are also some of the earliest of their own compositions (for those who are not Rolling Stones' veterans, songs credited to Nanker Phelge are actually by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards).<br /><br />The CD opens with a fine cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Around and Around\\" and closes with the classic \\"Susie Q,\\" well sung by the way.<br /><br />Let's sample some of the works.<br /><br />\\"Around and Around.\\" This is credible Chuck Berry (I never thought, for instance, that the Beatles, as talented as they were, could quite manage the essence of Berry's works). There is nice guitar work and great thumping piano playing.<br /><br />\\"Time Is on My Side.\\" Another cover and another classic.  The Stones made this their own song.  The rhythm section lays down a good base for the rest of the band.  Even at his young age, Jagger had the ability to get into a song and make it mean something.<br /><br />\\"Good Times, Bad Times.\\" The Rolling Stones have had a solid blues sensibility since their earliest works.  This song is their own blues piece (a Jagger-Richards composition).  A fine piece of blues. Great harmonica work and solid guitar work. The opening lines:<br /><br />\\"There've been good times,<br />There've been bad times.<br />I had my share of hard times, too.\\"<br /><br />\\"Under the Boardwalk.\\" I still find it hard to think of the Stones playing this summertime song! But they do it well and make this fun. Then, the CD closes out with a cool version of \\"Susie Q.\\"  Nice guitar work again.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you want a flavor of the early Rolling Stones, you can't do much better than this.  I hadn't listened to this album for eons, and it's still fresh and even interesting to listen to.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Dark City has always been in my top five favorite movies ever since I saw it in the theater.  Between the theater, VHS, and DVD, I have probably seen this movie 25-30 times.  Now, with the release of the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray, I am sure I will be watching it many more times.    The D.C. has many new pieces that add to the puzzle of the storyline.  Also, the removal of the intro voice over is a welcomed change.  Top that off with a crisp HD transfer, with deep blacks and vivid colors, and you've got a real masterpiece here.    I cannot recommend this enough.  Dark City is one of those movies that nobody seems to have heard of, but whenever I have forced somebody to watch, they ALWAYS love it.

031606792X|1.0|WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD    When you can live forever, what do you live for?   This question punctuated by a mood setting beat flashes through the screen in the trailer for the movie Twilight.   As Twilight begins, for Edward, the 108 years old vampire, who has been 17 for \\"a while\\", the answer is attending high school.    Last September as I dragged myself from class to class following my 12 year old busy schedule against a flow of other similarly stressed parents, I pondered this bizarre choice. Why would a 108 year old man, even one who looks like a Greek god, and his gorgeous siblings want to spend their days in high school?   It is not to make friends: The Cullens keep to themselves and do not mix with humans. And wouldn't college be more appropriate if they wanted to learn?   The only reason for this seems to be that the author needs Edward in High School so he meets Bella.    This is only one of many times in the series where nonsensical things happen just because the author needs the plot to go there.   For instance, going back to the trailer: we are shown images of the fight scene in the dance studio. This is \\"the\\" action scene in a book lacking in action. And yet, can anyone explain to me how and why Bella makes it there alone?   There are more examples:     In New Moon, Edward leaving Bella is but an obvious device to keep them separated and justify another book.    The phone call where Edward thinks Jacob is talking about Bella's funeral is contrived.   By the end of New Moon the Volturi tell Edward Bella has to become a vampire or they will kill her. But Edward still refuses for another book. How is he planning to fool the Volturi is never explained.    In Eclipse, there is a snow storm in summer time that comes out of nowhere to justify Jacob getting close to Bella, and Edward staying with them to stage the battle scene.     The plot of the three books can be summarized as follows: Girl meets boy. Boy is a vampire. Girl wants to be a vampire too so theycan be together. Boy refuses because he thinks vampires are killers. Boy finally agrees to make her a vampire.    The three first books deal with the romance, the unfulfilled love and the question of whether Edward and Bella will end together or not.   Breaking Dawn is different. By the end of Eclipse Bella has chosen Edward and Edward has agreed to make her a vampire. As BD starts they get married.    For many fans BD doesn't work because once they are married the question is answered and the romantic tension disappears.   That is not my main criticism of BD.    There are many reasons why BD doesn't work for me. Plot inconsistencies, scientific impossibilities, terrible pacing to name a few.   For instance, Edward didn't want Bella to become a vampire because vampires are killers. Werewolves exist to kill them for that very reason: to protect the humans. But as soon as Bella becomes a vampire, vampires are not evil anymore. Of course the Cullens don't kill humans. Yet when the Cullens need help from other vampires, they invite them over, and neither Bella nor her new family seem to mind too much that they are killing people. The werewolves don't do anything about it either.   Emmett at the beginning of New Moon goes feral upon smelling Bella's blood. This is the reason that prompts Edward to leave her. He wants to protect her from the potential threat vampires pose. At this point in the story we are lead to believe vampires are evil and must fight their instincts constantly or they would kill.   Yet when Bella becomes a vampire, the struggle is minimized to the point of non existence. Accepting the premise that vampires are always only a step away from going into a killing spree would challenge the \\"perfect happy world\\" Ms. Meyer wants to create.   But if vampires are not evil, Edward's reluctance to make Bella a vampire the one and only reason they didn't end up together in book one disappears.   The Cullens break human rules constantly. I guess to be otherworldlybeautiful gives them the right. For instance, Edward gets Bella admitted into Dartmouth College and no one seemed to think this is totally unethical.    I agree with other reviewers that the conflict with the Volturi is anticlimactic and unrealistic.    There is no doubt that the Volturi are killers. We have seen this in the gruesome scene at the end of New Moon where innocent Italian tourists are killed. They even kill vampires (innocent or otherwise). They kill one of the Cullen's friends in BD. Wouldn't the Cullens want to put an end to their power?   Apparently not. As long as they don't challenge their family directly, they do nothing.    Ms. Meyer'es excuse for avoiding the battle is that in a battle some of the \\"good\\" vampires would have died and she wanted a happy ending.   And so the Volturi leave and nothing is solved.   Another inconsistency: According to the Volturi's rules Charlie couldn't live as he knows part of the truth about vampires.   Now for the baby and the scientific explanations: they are ridiculous.   Dead is dead. Vampires may have poison, but to make a baby you need a spermatozoid and that is quite a different matter.    Simplifying: a poison is a chemical compound with a complexity of one. A spermatozoid has a complexity of millions.    To compare a poison with a spermatozoid is like comparing a word with a book. They are both made of letters (atoms the former). But the book is a little more complex. Besides, the spermatozoid is alive. Extending the analogy: a book is not only a group of words, but a group of words that tells a story.   Again spermatozoids are alive. Vampires are not. Ergo, vampires cannot make spermatozoids.    As for the number of chromosomes. Vampires, we are told, have 25 pairs of chromosomes, Humans 23. Trust me on this or look it up in your 10th grade Biology book. If the egg has 23 chromosomes and the spermatozoid 25, the resulting cells do not have 24. Some cells will have 23, others 24, others 25. The cells willnot be viable.  I am not being picky. I love Science Fiction. I am aware that the science in SF books is false. Yet it must make a little bit of sense.    Angel, the vampire from the series Angel, also has a son with another vampire. In the imaginary world created in this series, vampires cannot have children either. But at least they don't try to explain it, it is still impossible, they say, an anomaly. And because they don't try to explain it, I suspended my disbelief and went along with the story.   A recent book about vampires that uses science really well is Peeps by Scott Westerfeld.    What bothers me the most about BD is the fact that by becoming a vampire Bella becomes beautiful and that solves all her problems.    For three books she has whined that she is ugly and thus doubts that Edward loves her. But now that she is a vampire and beautiful, she doesn't doubt anymore. I found the implied message that self-confidence is tied to good looks disturbing.   As a reader I can't deny the Twilight series is engaging in the sense that you can't put it down. But as a writer, I found the Twilight series seriously lacking. The characters are shallow, the plot almost non-existent, the pacing sluggish, and the storyline full of contradictions.   Now that the series is over and I can look at the story with perspective what strike me most is the futility of it all.    Bella never doubts she wants to be a vampire. I am not surprised. As a human she didn't have much of a life. But it is not only Bella who had no life. Edward had none either.   For an immortal he has had a pretty uneventful past. For one who is going to live forever he seems to have no plans for the future.   As for the question: When you can live forever, what do you live for? For Bella in BD the answer is simple: Sex. Sex, it seems, is all she ever wanted.    Seriously, what does this family of super talented vampires live for?   There is no mysterious higher purpose as the haunting music suggests in thetrailer. Except for Carlile that works as a doctor, the rest of the Cullens do nothing but enjoy their own shallow existence.   The world Twilight conjures is the ultimate teenage fantasy. A world of beautiful people, eternally young, that do not need jobs or have to worry about money, or disease. They live in a happy present without worries of a future that will be more of the same.   Teenagers are narcissistic current research indicates (something to do with their front lobe not been totally developed) and thus, because their emphatic abilities are impaired, they have an excuse to be so self-centered. What is the vampires excuse?   Yes, I know, most of us humans don't do much for others either. But we don't have superpowers and as Spiderman puts it \\"With big power, comes big responsibility.\\"    The fact that I am taking wisdom from a comic book hero, underlines my problem with the Twilight characters: Bella and the Cullens are so narcissistic that even comic superheroes seem deep by comparison.   Don't get me wrong. I am all for romantic love and happy endings (Listening to Jacques Brel declaiming Ne me quitte Pas/Don't leave me in YouTube gives me goose bumps) but Bella and Edward are too self-involved to engage my sympathy.   I may be old-fashioned but I like my heroes/heroines a little more . . . heroic?

I knew Dark Knight was going to be good but this one...oh man.  I didn't want to see it in theaters for fear of disappointment, but upon buying the DVD, I regret not seeing it on the big screen.  Robert Downey Jr is just the best Stark for this movie.  I am simply speechless as to what else to add to this review except that it was worth the 23 dollars for the 2 disc and I wish I had a Blu Ray player to experience this movie the right way.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This BBC drama is set in drab industrial London;  one would think the movie would be just as slow/dreary - but NOT the case!<br /><br />The lead male is magnetic in his somber yet fiery portayl of the mill \\"master\\"... a British Hugh Jackman if you will.  The heroine is truly a heroine - and I love that she is not a waif, but a new face, in which she brings her role spirit and courage. And the mother - has the most captivating accent and dark demeanor.<br /><br />North & South entrenches you in it's dark times of cotton mill industrialism, but uplifts you to see the romance and hope for the common man by the finish.  The town's turmoil and unlikely romance make for a fantastic film!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|First of all best show...clothing, sets, vehicles etc. straight up 60's.  Gorgeous show!  Story lines interesting as well... Big zippo  lighter, sounds cool, huh? Only amazon is misrepresenting this product with the pictures...I ordered it because of the zippo but got plain packaging instead...called amazon they apologized and assured me that they would send the special edition...anddd they sent out the same one the following week...GREAT return policy however  it is too bad that they are not able to communicate with the folks that are in charge of inventory. So buy it you won't be sorry...but zippo lighter it is NOT!
B000HXE12S|5.0|As the standard goes, it's difficult to imagine \\"Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice\\", becoming anything less than representative of the best of 3rd Wave black metal. With the lack of new ideas that emerged from established 90's acts after the turn of the millennium musicologists will point to Deathspell Omega as a primary reason black metal continued to evolve instead of losing its relevance or becoming fodder for nostalgic retro visitations.<br /><br />What Deathspell Omega does cannot be put in  a box, however an approximation follows. DsO takes the sloppy & lo-fi ideal of black metal (especially early Darkthrone & Mayhem) and tightens the playing but not the production. Then DsO layers this with avant-garde curiosities currently within the style, less profoundly but until this record, most successfully represented on Blut Aus Nord's work through \\"The Work Which Transforms God\\". However, while BAN prefer to create cyclical atmospheric prisons DsO delivers dissonance with the frenetic playing of unconventional signatures & arrangements. Further, DsO underscore the brutality bookending this created discord with ambient sections or chant. The band developed this technique more on follow-up EP \\"Kenose\\", but especially on \\"Fas - Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeturnum\\". Often and repeatedly, the violence overtakes the atmosphere without warning so that over the course of the album the listener leaves feeling battered.<br /><br />This playing of complex rhythms exceedingly fast and Deathspell Omega's effective use of dynamics is not the extent of appeal here. These facets of the bands sound were established at least in primitive form from the beginning. Mikko Aspa's lyrical influences, specifically his interest in post-surrealism and Georges Batailles is a critical element that further seperates DsO from their peers. Bataille's chief fascination was with excess (if you care to you might start with his book, The Accursed Share) and its capacity to redefine economies and to oppose God. He is perhaps one philosophic evolutionary notch above Ayn Rand. When most black metal appeals to the gut, inspiring boy-like nostalgia for wonder of monsters or mythology, either physical or metaphorical (ie. nationalism) or, just as likely, attempts to fortify adolescent arguments of nihilism with tenuous invective and vitriol, DsO stimulate intellectually while delighting or frightening, depending on the listener's temperament, with their subversive purpose and insistence to remain at the very edge of will. On \\"Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice\\", Deathspell Omega reinterprets Scripture so as to appeal to the listener's logic while  undermining and inverting the Scripture's intent. The artistic compontant of the packaging is a deliberate continuation of the lyrical device. To the point, the booklet includes a particularly incendiary example of vintage French pornography, likely from Batailles time when it would have inspired him to eventually inspire DsO. By including the photo DsO posits the argument quite effectively that this isn't pornography at all, but art that illicits a stark, real emotional response.<br /><br />Deathspell Omega's critical flaw on a theosophical level is to over-estimate the value of man's logic when applied to the extra-dimensional world beyond us, which of course is where God, Satan and their answers are. If Deathspell Omega's music can't be contained in box, certainly neither can God. DsO have poured over their dissection of the minutiae of God, parading their powers of discernment (as did Batailles), but in leading with their heads instead of their hearts, find nothing but failure, frustration & fear.  God has no interest in an unthinking church, but that organ doesn't have the capacity to know God. This struggle is, more than anything, what DsO's music is about. The misery their struggle has created has fueled an undeniable masterwork and vaulted to prominence the most exciting development to emerge from the black metal underground.

B0000028SR|5.0|This CD has always been underrated because it is an album without the E Street Band but is actually a very good CD. It contains several good songs including the title tune and is a nice companion to \\"Lucky Town\\", which was released at the same time.    Though it lacks the E Street Band, it is still Bruce Springsteen playing rock n roll and that is hard to ignore. I continue to listen to the CD today.    It might not rank with BUSA or RIVER but it ranks above TOM JOAD and THE RISING and bridges a long gap before MAGIC was released last year. I exclude TRACKS and other releases of old material between 1995-2006 in that opinion.     Any fan of Springsteen's cannot go wrong purchasing this CD.

B001BKXUOQ|5.0|well i only want to say that probably this album is gonna be the best rock/metal album of the year , i like it so much, this album contains   very good hard songs, balads,bonos song, and SOLOS, the dvd is not what expect its so short and I think that it could been better with a couple live songs.  slipknot all hope is gone and metallica death magnetic the best rock/metal albums of the year i think.  in spanish:  simplemente un excelente disco mas elaborado y armonico que contiene excelentes canciones fuertes y hasta con solos de guitarras, slipknot sin duda con este trabajo se consolida como uno de los mejores grupos de rock/metal en el planeta.  en mi opinion este disco y el ultimo trabajo de metallica death magnetic   son lo mejor del año.
B000AARKW6|4.0|I've watched every movie Pacino has ever been in or acted in and I have to put \\"Carlito's way\\" at the top 10 of his movie list. In my opinion it surpasses even \\"Scarface\\" as far as the over all artistic quality of the film and acting. Sorry folks! I know a lot of you love Scarface, but if you watch a younger Pacino in \\"Panic in Needle park,\\" or \\"Scarecrow\\" you will see a much more engaged and talented actor.   I liked Carlito's way because it showed Pacino's incredible character range in portraying a Nuyorican in the 70s era. Not only was he believable, but he did it with a beautiful flare. It had a perfect musical score and the cinematography was excellent. I couldn't ask for much more except I would've liked for the film to cover the book in it's entirety. Instead of just basing the film on the second half of the book, \\"After hours\\" they should have did \\"Carlito's way\\" and \\"After hours.\\" That's my only complaint. So, in closing the movie wasn't perfect, but it definitely shows Pacino's talent as an actor.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Pink Floyd evolved to a super group over the years, but I love to go back to the early years. They were way ahead of their time. I remember when I was first introduced to Pink Floyd in Spring 1968, when I saw a video of \\"Let There Be More Light\\" on TV. That got my attention, and I've been a fan ever since.
0439023483|3.0|Don't get me wrong: there is a LOT of good and even excellent science fiction and fantasy in the \\"young adult\\" (worst age-related euphemism ever) market. I enjoyed William Sleator's books in high school, and Garth Nix's Old Kingdom trilogy is among my favourite fantasy. So I thought this was worth a try, and it was. My overall impression of it was that it's enjoyable, and the plot moves along at a decent pace once it gets started. If you just want some book to kill time this will do. However, there is nothing particularly memorable or ingenious here.    The story is set on the east coast of what is now the United States of America. Presumably this is several hundred years in the future, after a war which has not only destroyed the USA but also cut the survivors off from the rest of the world. Around where Washington, D.C. used to be, there is a city called Panem surrounded by thirteen districts which supply it with food and materials, and are kept under control by Panem's technological superiority. The people in the districts, on the other hand, live in almost mediaeval conditions.    Every year two children are picked from each district and made to fight to the death in a reality TV show called \\"The Hunger Games\\". The sole survivor's district is showered with food for the rest of the year. Sixteen-year-old Katniss from District 12 is our narrator - the book is written in her voice. It's kind of choppy though, because sometimes the voice flows naturally as if she's telling the story to a friend, and at other times, especially when the writer is describing the world Katniss lives in, it sounds stilted and fake.    As mentioned, the story moves at a decent pace once it gets going. About two-fifths of the page count is spent on Katniss' life at home, her trip to Panem and grooming as a celebrity for the Games. We get a good overview of her world and how it got that way, but during this long introduction nothing feels all that important. A twist in relationships betweenKatniss and the other kid from District 12 is introduced.    Once all 24 children are in the arena, things get more interesting. The organizers play off the participants against each other by introducing obstacles, dropping gifts strategically, prodding them into \\"teams\\", and so on to make it more exciting. It's an effective parody of a reality TV show taken to its logical conclusion. Most of this was fun to read. The zombie werewolves near the end (I'm not kidding!) were the most ridiculous part.    To me the main weakness of the book was that, for all the intensely complicated relationships and griefs that Katniss experiences, and the atrocities that take place in her world, the author didn't make me feel an emotional connection to it. It feels like it's made up of a bunch of science fiction elements patched together, and between that and the stilted narrative voice, it didn't feel as real as it should have.
0930289234|5.0|As I always am when it comes to popular culture, I was skeptical to the idea of enjoying Watchmen when I first heard about it. I am a filmmaker and was recently in awe of the trailer for the upcoming movie in 2009. I plan on seeing this movie, but I couldn't see it without reading the graphic novel first. That's just wrong.<br />So I bought a copy, still thinking that it wasn't going to be as great as everyone said it was. Well... within the first chapter, I was completely hooked. Alan Moore has a way of crafting his work that works flawlessly within a comic book atmosphere. And David Gibbon's art has never been better.<br />Watchmen takes place in an alternate 1985, where vigilantes are a common part of society. However, they have all but completely disappeared, some retired, some with other jobs. But two remain, Rorsach and The Comedian. Upon the murder of the Comedian, Rorsach takes it upon himself to find the murderer, and ultimately answer the infamous question, \\"Who Watches the Watchmen?\\"<br />The story almost looks upon comics books and superheroes in a satirical way, underlined with a deathly serious message. This masterpiece holds its own against almost any other modern competitor, and should definitely be something you read soon!<br />Happy reading!

B000NTPDSW|2.0|I love Bluray and I love the Godfather so this appeared to be a perfect marriage. But, right from the start I was wondering if I had received the wrong discs or something. In some cases the picture quality seems to be not even as good as some previous DVD versions played via a BluRay player, in other cases the picture quality is downright terrible. What exactly did they spend that year they claim the restoration took doing? I understand that older movies won't ever look as good as other BluRay transfers but this is basically a rip-off. I have several other versions of these movies and wouldn't have bought this one if i had had any sense that the picture quality would not be any better....who would? I have the best possible set up from a player/television/connections standpoint so it isn't the equipment. Save your money and use one of the prior releases.

1594201749|5.0|This dazzling book could have been called \\"Loving the Enemy.\\" That is, in fact, what Nelson Mandela did to prevent a much feared bloodbath in South Africa as it passed from the hated Apartheid regime to majority rule.  \\"Playing the Enemy\\" shows how he did it - first by winning over his prison guards through forgiveness and simple human  kindness then by his shrewd seduction of the white government leadership  and finally by making  the obsession of white South Africa, its Rugby team, the team of all South Africans - black and white.  It's The Greatest Story Ever Told for the twentieth century - and beyond!

B000E5N62U|5.0|MORPH THE CAT is a great set of songs, a bit on the short side, but in terms of quality, almost on a par with THE NIGHTFLY.  Most of the tracks on MORPH are strong, especially the funky title song.  As usual, Fagen shows off his many gifts as lyricist, composer, singer, player and arranger. With MORPH he focuses, appropriately, given his age, on issues of mortality. He's also addressing the current political climate in a funny and subtle way.  \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" is a beautiful ode to longevity and love.  \\"Brite Nightgown,\\" Fagen's funny tribute to the Grim Reaper (\\"f--- the fella in the Brite Nightgown\\"), is incredibly catchy. \\"What I Do\\" has a funky groove and is a nice tribute to Ray Charles.  \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" and \\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\" are dissimilar in style but carry the same ominous post-9/11 message with musical and lyrical eloquence. \\"The H Gang\\" and \\"Security Joan\\" are astute social satires.  Musically, \\"Joan\\" is the weakest cut on the album, but Fagen's lyrics still amuse, and I chuckle every time I hear him say \\"search me now.\\"    As a musician, I enjoy analyzing Fagen's harmonies.  Underneath Fagen's sophisticated, jazzy substitutions he's firmly rooted in the blues, which he invigorates with his unique stamp.  MORPH passes the \\"repeated-listenings test\\" with flying colors; it has no expiration date.  And apparently, neither does Fagen, because he's been producing the highest quality material for almost four decades now.  Every time I listen, whether to Steely Dan or Donald on his own, my ears are refreshed and my mind and soul are elevated.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|I love this CD. What attracted me was her song Spotlight. I am always leary of buying cd's because there may only be one or two good songs. However, I must say I enjoy this entire cd. Jennifer has such a powerful voice and I'm sure we'll be hearing alot from her.
0451528018|5.0|\\"The Hound of The Baskervilles\\" by Arthur Conan Doyle was interesting from the first page. There's already a mystery to be solved right when you open the book, with a mysterious cane left in Watson and Sherlock's office.<br /><br />  Doyle keeps each page filled with suspense and thrills. Even as I read, I could hear the low, mournful sound of the hound that Stapleton keeps locked up baying across the moor.<br /> The characters are amazing and funny. Sherlock Holmes keeps me giggling with all of his oddities and eccentrities. Watson is amusing with his normal assumptions next to Sherlock.<br />The mystery is intriguing and darker and deeper than it first appears. The book can actually be rather creepy and suspenseful, unlike the other mystery novels where they're solving the typical robbery, or something like that.<br />The only thing that I didn't like as much compared to other authors I've read was that his sense of description wasn't as good. I had to rely more on my imagination to see the moors as he described it rather than what it really looked like.<br /> Yet in spite of that, the novel was comedy, mystery, and a pinch of horror all rolled into one delicious enchilada.
B0000009TJ|3.0|I ordered this CD based on the strength of a few songs I had heard elsewhere, namely \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"Bolero\\".  These songs, in addition to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" are terrific.  Extremely well recorded as well (from an audiophile standpoint).  The rest of the album is, well, interesting to say the least.  I understand from the liner notes that the band disbanded mid-tour.  I can see why, after listening to a few of the recordings here.  It sounds self-indulgent, bordering on disaster at times.  I can't imagine sitting in the audience for this concert!  At times it sounded like all the instruments were dropped down a set of stairs.  In summary, Zappa had a great opportunity to have created something exceptional.  Instead, we got a mess.

B000YAA68C|1.0|Yea, cant really believe people are giving this 4 stars on average.  I do agree Hillary Swank did a overall great job as well as Harry Jr. as the side character.  Actually I would of given this movie 4 out of 5 if not for one scene in which I think ruins the movie.  The whole \\"You kiss like my sister\\"  and \\"oh I'm glad you think so to\\"  scene.  \\"oh lets be friends\\"  Yea horribly acted and totally unrealistic. Besides the whole way he says it justs gives me the creeps and a few laughs since.  I know his character is brash but come on.  Could of done that scene a thousand other ways....ok ok this is based on book which I have not read, and based on that scene I surely wont be reading.  I guess overall good movie but when you see the scene with Yankee stadium....turn off the sound for about 3 min.    Then I imagine it could be a satisfying movie.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|There are some pretty thorough reviews here, so I won't attempt to out-do them. What I love about this film is the fact that it so perfectly captures the original musical. That is due in large part to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp - these 2 are the reason the movie was a total success. Other good things: the costumes were stunning, the cinematography was just haunting, and the actors, were in large part, wonderful. I was incredibly suprised by Sacha Benton Cohen, who, I was convinced, would destroy the part, but I loved him in it. Alan Rickman is a god, as always. Whether playing Snape, the Judge, or the Colonel Brandon, he's incredible.      The  2 weak links in this film were Helena Bodham Carter as Mrs. Lovett and the boy (I don't know his name) who played Anthony. Let's be real. She got the part because Tim Burton's her hubby/live-in lover. She LOOKS great in the part of Mrs. Lovett, but she can't sing worth two hoots. Seriously. Can't sing a note. As for the boy who played Anthony, he was a bit too wussy for my taste - especially a kid who was a sailor.     Another observation: Although this should be fairly explanatory given teh subject matter, please, please do not let your children see this movie. It's very, very violent and while the blood is very fake, it can be frightening for young children - tweens.     But, the film is wonderful. Whether you're a Sondheim fan, a Burton fan, both, or neither, this film is sure to please.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The most beautiful thing about the movie is the relationship between the young man and the little girl. She at once appears to understand and yet not. Her interpretation of his storties are rather charming. The Indian is seen by her as a real east indian and not what is meant. Most of the story scenes have a naive quality since they are really showing how she is seeing the story. She wants his stories, all the while he is sinking deeper in pain and sadness.<br /><br />The movie reminded me of the French movie Ponette, because the little girl did such a great job. Similar to that movie, this one has  loss and redemption that leave you feeling wordless when the movie ends.<br />A really wonderful movie. One of the best.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1572522747 Ponette]]
0446579939|5.0|This is a wonderful novel, told in a way that is fascinating and enjoyable. Nicolas Sparks knows how to tell a story.  The characters are real and believable. I found myself caring about them early in the book. The author has the ability to make people come alive in just a few pages. Once I began to care about them, I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down until I was done. The Lucky One made for a few very enjoyable hours. That is what I want in a book: discovering people that I care about, and a good story to follow them through.  It may not be great literature for the ages, but it suits me.<br /><br />I don't usually read love stories, but I am glad that I found this one. After finishing this novel, I decided to look up the author's other books. I believe that he has written some other good stories that I will enjoy. I believe that you will too.
0897501438|5.0|Siju Bruce Lee the legendary martial artist and philosopher on his first and only treatised on the art he created, the jeet kune do. there were many very good books in JKD but this is the best of the best and it is written by the originator. Siju Bruce Lee was the first international recognized martial artist who was very vocal on what are the real things happen in unarmed self defense. He is the one who said what is really working in real situation and what is not as you will learned on this book. many martial arts experts are saying that our system is the best, but Siju tells us that there is no best system of martial art but only a better practitioner, as we seen on MMA fighting and many different self defense system. unfortunately Siju Bruce Lee died on early age before his philisophies were international recognized and accepted. If u want to learned what really JKD is all about, this is the book to be studied and because this book lacks pictures on how the tecniques have been done, many so called JKD practitioner used the name JKD just to promote their art and interpretation on what the book actually teached. this book is like a \\"BIBLE\\" of unarmed fighting, you will learned through your own understanding and interpretation on the written techniques and philosophies of unarmed combat. a 5 star rating (or is there any more higher than 5?)were given for the great SIJU BRUCE LEE.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|Errol Flynn's take on the Robin Hood myth is legendary. Lovely Olivia deHavilland is a fine romantic interest, especially as she changes from the antagonist in the early scenes to the realization of Robin's altruistic motives during her stay in Sherwood.  The latest re-incarnation on video is an absolutely glowing Technicolor reproduction<br />on blu-ray. The verdant greens of Sherwood near pop off the screen.<br />It's hard to believe the film is 70 years old. Warners has restored it<br />to its pristene glory and included a plethora of extras including an<br />excellent audio commentary. Add to that Michael Curtiz' lively direction and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's rousing score, it's a classic not to be missed.
0743297334|3.0|Dave Foster Wallace urged writers to eschew irony. I feel the same way, and the reason is that for irony to have its effects the society at large must have a solid moral center of good permeating though it, like it did even after the first world war, although that center was by then seriously deteriorating. Then, when one reads a book like this, one clearly understands and is not afraid to feel the irony of this book; its amoral characters, and its nihilistic portrait.<br /><br />By 2008, that center is nowhere to be found, and hence readers look for something else in any book; sympathize with the characters, to get something warm and true in the positive sense from the experience, to \\"enjoy\\" books, rather than learning a dry lesson (the spare prose helps) in the negative. These are atrocious characters. All of them, even Cohn to whom the center of good gravitates simply because he is an old world degenerate rather than a new world one. You don't go around beating people up. I don't know how clear I was in expressing my thoughts, but I feel that irony in writing has outlived its usefulness.<br /><br />Also, these characters do not think, or do their best not to. They are bottom feeders on the evolutionary ladder who's only goal is to survive, not improve anyone elses lives including their own. They get drunk and seemingly take in sense perceptions like primative organisms, animals really. But they are people. Bret I can't stand, and Jake, well, what can one say? His lot in life is awful but still look how he copes with it. He gets drunk, loves a trecherous woman, takes exteme pleasure from the barberous Corrida, but I'm not judging, at least I don't want to do that, just to say that the whole senario is rather pathetic and sad.<br /><br />Since this was the situation for some after the First World War, and this book now stands as a symbolic ode to its aftermath, I don't know. Maybe the world did unravel, but, I belive that chronicling the fact the way it's done in this book, cloaked in symbolic characters then, is, in my opinion, two long steps removed from what art is suppose to do.<br /><br />I read this book in college and remember the fresh feeling I got as Hemingway puts you in a spare place and shows you around pretty well; the crisp air, the stark oulines of buildings and people. On this and final reading there was a glimmer of this, but, of course, when I first read it I didn't have the tools to think about it at all. And everything that really matters this time around totally eclipsed those immediate sensual lunges at a clean physical life.symbolic characters then, is, in my opinion, two long steps removed from what art is suppose to do.

B0009P42S2|2.0|You won't find a bigger fan of Anime than me. I still have all of my old Streamline VHS tapes, including Akira. Mechanically, Otomo's attention to detail is extraordinary--the man explains everything. He's so anal about every little system that I wonder if he ever gets out and around real people. That would account for how intimately he knows machines, yet how poorly he's able to program real human feelings and situations into his work. With Otomo, Everything is so apocalyptic and gargantuan that the characters are reduced to atoms. Therein lies the problem with his movies. Akira, Steamboy, etc.-- the characters in all of his films are cardboard and generic. Otomo's films are overrated and he's overrated. Watching Steamboy is like watching an autopsy. If he could have put half as much effort into the characters, Steamboy would have been an ok film.
B001CLG6RC|3.0|Okay, i had high hopes for it and did something i don't normally do...i bought first, listened later. It doesn't retain the sound that catapalted enigma to popularity back in the day. There is \\"some\\" reminence here, but it still reminds me more of the voyageur sound...which i was also slightly disappointed with. I'm going to do all of you a big favor here though...The two main people from engima did a side project within the last year or so with another band that sounds like the old enigma many came to love. The CD is entitled \\"Achillea\\"...It is amazing. I promise you'll like this CD if you enjoyed enigmas first few CD's. I discovered by scouring forums a while back.    Anyway, is this CD worth buying? i'm not sure. I bought it, i don't regret it because it still has some gems and some decent sounds, but i was disappointed....and WTH was up with Track 6 \\"Hell's Heaven\\" There are some HORRID sounds placed into that song that do nothing to help the beat or overall feel of the song...If that was Hell's Heaven would sound like...then i never want to visit such a place even more so.    i really miss some of their old instrumentals...especially the one that starred in engima's \\"Sadness\\" track
B0015FML06|3.0|Although, I agree with the overall sentiment, the picture quality is quite bad.  I can't believe that the film has become this damaged in less than 30 years. Red lines that look much like someone took a red marker to the DVD picture, are present throughout the entire concert.  They are most noticable on close up shots of Bono and The Edge. They were not on the orginal version and it is too bad Island did not come clean with this fact before releasing it to DVD.  Maybe I have a defective copy. But I checked a couple of versions posted on the internet and the lines show up there as well.    Having said this, \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" put U2 on the map and this landmark show is still worth owning. What it lacks in picture quality is made up in the new stereo mix and Surround Sound addition.
B000VKW6O2|4.0|I bougth this DVD mainly because Leo Nucci who is a veteran of the opera stage and have never dissapointed me.  However there is something that bothers me of all these Zurich productions (i.e. Don Pasquale with Juan Diego Florez and now this one).  They try to produce something in the midway between Eurotrash and traditional opera staging without succeding in any of both grounds.  The staging of this Rigoletto is quite rigid and the scenes with the crowds (the court of the Duke) are painfully static and detached from the drama on stage.  These swiss guys do not seem to understand what is going on, they look kind of souless and, believe me, it is not because the Duke's court is supposed to be full of jerks, but simply because these guys cannot act.  The opening party at the Duke's Palace goes extremely slow compared, for instance, with the crude orgy of Mac Vicar's production for Covent Garden.      Putting the bad aspects of this production apart I have to say that I was quite surprised by the tenor in the role of the Duke, a famous unknown (at least for me)polish tenor whose name is Piotr Bczala. I never heard of him before.  Indeed I was very moved by his beautiful and powerful voice and the interpretation of the role, specially in my all time favorite:  Parmi Veder le lacrime (Second act).  This guy really rules even over an old Nucci who has his ups and downs all through the opera.      Elena Mosuc in the role of Gilda is OK, her voice is nice and sweet but a bit too small and, at times, you have the feeling that she is having troubles trying to be heard over the orchestra.  However she does a terrific job in Caro nome.    The last act is, by far the best one since it does not involve the static crowd of the Duke's court.  This act is entirely on the singers hands (actually on the singers voices).  The famous quartet is the summit of the whole opera, powefully done by the whole ensemble, bravo to all of them but, again Piotr Beczala excels here.  By the way themezzo Katharina Peetz, the Maddalena of this Rigoletto, is a real hottie. No wonder the duke abandoned Elena Mosuc for her :)    Nello Santi is a great conductor, however the orchestra goes far too slow and heavy all the time.  Having a pic of the orchestra pit you can understand what is going on, again most of these musicians look quite detached and tired lacking of italian stamina.     Anyway, the real star in this uneven Rigoletto is definetely Piotr Beczala who soon, I think, will become an important figure in the hall of fame of Pavarotti's succesors.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Well, I have been not been reviewing music in a while, but this deserves the time to say, YES!  Viva la Vida is everything that I have been missing lately in music.

B001DUJNGS|1.0|After I heard this album is coming, I thought it would be as good as the first four Enigma albums I thought Enigma was back but like E5 and E6 there are just 1-2 good songs in it other song are just \\"boom boom\\" no melody, no \\"music\\" just some basses that's all.<br /><br />In my opinion, there are just 2 good songs in Seven lives many faces: La puerta Del cielo and The same parents, others are just fillers there is nothing musical in them, no musical \\"textures\\" no atmosphere, nothing. I think even 8 years old ordinary kid can compose that kind of \\"boom boom\\" and empty music.
B00003CXDD|3.0|WARNING: This review may contain spoilers!    George Lucas ([[ASIN:B00003CXCT Star Wars Trilogy]]) has always enjoyed delving into mythological archetypes in his films and when Willow was released in 1988, it served as an example of his fascination with stories of unlikely and unexpected heroes. Directed by Ron Howard ([[ASIN:B00015YVD6 Splash]]), Willow was a Box Office and critical disappointment when it first debuted, however since then it has developed a loyal following of diehard fans.    When a baby girl is born bearing a birthmark on her arm, a birthmark that signifies that she will overthrow the evil queen Bavmorda, Bavmorda orders the child's destruction. But the nursemaid who was attending the baby's mother hides the newborn in a pile of laundry and escapes the queen's castle without detection. When Bavmorda discovers that the child is missing, she sends out her soldiers and Death Dogs to retrieve the baby. When the nursemaid sees the approaching Death Dogs, she sends the baby down the river in a raft, which is carried downstream until it washes up on the riverbank of a Nelwyn (a race of short people similar to dwarfs) village. The baby is found by two Nelwyn children who tell their father Willow, a local farmer and aspiring sorcerer's apprentice. Willow doesn't dare tell the other Nelwyns of his discovery for fear that he will be blamed for any misfortune that may befall their village (Nelwyns are naturally superstitious and fearful of the outside world). But after an attack by the Queen's Death Dogs, Willow takes the baby before the village council where he is chosen to take the baby back to the Daikini (the Nelwyn term for tall people) lands. Willow embarks on a perilous journey, with only a small group of Nelwyns, and it's not long before he comes across a charismatic Daikini prisoner named Madmartigan. Madmartigan claims that he would take care of the baby if they would just free him from his hanging cage, which the Nelwyns do with some reluctance. AsWillow heads home, he discovers that the baby has been kidnapped by Brownies (tiny mischievous forest sprites) who take the baby to the realm of the Fairy Queen. She bestows unto Willow a magic wand and tells him that he must safeguard the baby, who she tells him is named Elora Danan. Following the Fairy Queen's instructions, Willow then takes Elora to the island where famous sorceress Fin Raziel has been exiled. He is guided by two of the Brownies, Franjean and Rool, and soon they meet up with Madmartigan. Bavmorda's soldiers track them down and Madmartigan proves to be a valiant warrior and expert swordsman. By the time Willow finds Fin Raziel, she has been turned into a possum-like creature by Bavmorda (why Bavmorda didn't simply kill Raziel, I'll never know). Bavmorda's soldiers are lead by her beautiful and rebellious daughter Sorsha, who captures Willow and his companions. After a daring escape Willow, Elora, Madmartigan, and Raziel seek out the castle of Tir Asleen where they will be safe from Bavmorda's army. However, upon their arrival they discover that the castle is under a curse, and worse, it's crawling with hairy, odorous, flesh-eating trolls. When Bavmorda's army attacks and Elora is abducted, Madmartigan defends the castle and stages a climactic battle against Bavmorda's vile forces. Meanwhile Willow and Raziel face Bavmorda in an exciting final confrontation of magic against magic.    The cast includes Warwick Davis as Willow, Val Kilmer as Madmartigan, Jean Marsh as Bavmorda, Patricia Hayes as Raziel, and Joanne Whalley as Sorsha.  The film's strengths are its elaborate action scenes depicting swordfights, battles with vicious trolls, and a fight against a two-headed, fire-breathing dragon. However the film suffers from a script, which isn't sure whether the film is intended for a sophisticated adult audience or an audience of children. Ultimately the film appeals to an audience of predominantly male viewers, between the ages of six and thirteen years old.    The special features on this DVD include an audio commentary by Warwick Davis, Willow: The Making of an Adventure vintage featurette, From Morf to Morphing: the Dawn of Digital Filmmaking featurette, production stills and image gallery, and theatrical trailers and TV spots.

B0019T9FL6|4.0|Okay, so this may not have been THE CD many of her fans had hoped, but I actually enjoyed it. \\"Spotlight\\" was a really good single and there are a few other songs on the CD that could be POTENTIAL singles such as \\"If This Isn't Love\\" and \\"You Pulled me Through\\". Personally my favorites are \\"I'm Only his Woman\\" feat. Fantasia, \\"We gon Fight\\", the Dreamgirls track and Gospel tune at the end. If you like the style of 90's R&B then you should be pretty happy. The CD should do well but Miss Hudson better not hope the \\"Spotlight\\" does not get too much on her fellow label mate Jazmine Sullivan.

0312330529|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who was reading it. It is absolutely a must read book. I felt as though I learned more about life in India in the first fifty pages than I knew in my life so far (I don't get out much.)It felt as if I was reading an autobiography, and after reading about the authors life, that feeling may not be far from the truth. The characters are well developed,the plot lines are numerous without getting tangled. The revelations about Australian and Indian prisons and the Indian mob are complex in their textures. I don't want to give anything away, for though there are a lot of pages, I looked forward to each one.

0375826726|5.0|In Brisingr, Chris Paolini delves headfirst into development of Eragon. The moral and physical conflicts come to a head, and are handled well. I see this book as a coming-of-age point in the series, where Eragon recongizes what his has to do and why he has to do it.     It starts grippingly, but loses a bit of suspense towards the end. It kept me enthralled from start to finish, but began to drag some.     As it continues we see how Eragon and Saphira operate when separated, how Eragon deals independently with the trials he has set up for himself. We see his flaws and how he reconciles being a Rider and being a human.     Overall, an excellent addition to the series.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|I remember when I first heard Trivium when Ember To Inferno came out. I didn't care for the sound that much, but then a couple of years later came Ascendancy, and what I heard was a well-crafted metal record that breathed old-school thrash. These guys were no doubt for the new school that had no clue about Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament, Exodus. etc. Then came The Crusade: the album where they let their influences out. Many however felt that to be a bad thing for a couple of reasons: lead vocalist Matt opted for less screaming and more singing and shouting. There were also claims of them ripping off Metallica. Say whatever you want, but I don't hear it. Besides, why should anybody be concerned as long as it sounds good? Well, on 2008's new album Shogun, I find no reason to draw comparisons or rip-off claims, and you'd be crazy to try. This sounds like nothing they've done before. Back to Matt's vocals, remember that his vocals hadn't fully developed because he was so young, he was better at screaming. He couldn't pull off a lot of the vocal harmonies live like on such songs as Pull Harder On The Strings of Your Martyr, and A Gunshot To The Head of Trepidation. After vocal training, he could do both equally well, but for The Crusade, he opted to sing more due to too many bands doing the screaming thing at the time....until now. The guys figured out that the new songs didn't work without the screaming, and trust me, there's plenty on each song. While Shogun may not change the hater's minds, it will please those that loved their previous albums, even if they didn't like The Crusade.

B000IOM0WO|2.0|I can not see any difference in quality between this Blu-ray version and the VHS video version i have.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This may be the best album ive ever purchased as well as heard, which is a bold statement considering I spend a great deal of money on cds. This cd is revolutionary in the world of metal. Phil really shows his vocal capabilities in this album, in my opinion he has the best scream out there, ranging for a low growl to a high pitched punch in the face. Not only can he scream, but he also has a very surprising singing voice which is used to the fullest in almost every song. The guitar work and the drumming step up their game as well, including: much faster double bass, and much more complex guitar riffs and soloing. To make things short...you would be an absolute fool not to buy this album.
B001C08RHA|3.0|Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.  He inherited Stark Enterprises from his father, and has turned it into the leader in international weapons.  He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.<br /><br />On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, things go wrong and he is kidnapped by a gang of terrorists.  What he sees there changes his outlook on his business.  After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.  He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.  This does sit well with the board or Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's partner.  Will the new suit he is building help him with his goals?<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is it is an origin story.  As a result, much of the movie is slow, even for someone like me who is unfamiliar with the character.  What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.  The climax didn't quite make sense, but that's worth noting only in passing.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the special effects were great, especially the shots from Iron Man's point of view.  And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.<br /><br />The biggest problem the movie has is the characters.  Even with all the time spent creating Iron Man, we aren't given time to get to know the characters.  This is especially problematic for Tony who comes across as an egotistical jerk at first.  While his character softens, I never fully warmed up to him.  The other characters are only given one or two notes, and that isn't enough to make us truly care for any of them.<br /><br />Now this isn't a reflection on the top notch actors.  In addition to the two already mentioned, we've got Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.  I will admit that I couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.  It's more of a personal problem, but it was another stumbling block in any attempts to warm up to Tony.<br /><br />To me, the flaws were equal to the strengths, making this a fun but shallow superhero movie.couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|It took almost 3 years to make this record but it was worth the wait.  Producer Rick Rubin did a great job encouraging them to go back to their roots and release an album with the traditional thrash metal sound.    Here we have 10 great songs, good vocals, good drums and bass and excellent guitar solos.  Kirk got his revenge on this one after a decade of silence.  Songs like 'the day that never comes', 'Suicide & Redemption' and 'the judas kiss' are classics like 'One' and 'Master of Puppets'.  This record competes with their 80's masterpieces like Justice, Puppets and lightning.  Black album was a good and successful record but this is definitelly better.    The true Kings of metal are back!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Right from the opening credits, a dark atmosphere permeates the scene and sets the mood for 'Sweeney Todd'.  Arriving on the shores of London are Mr. Sweeney Todd (played by Johnny Depp), who once was a barber named Benjamin Barker, and his sailor friend Anthony.  Anthony knows the tale of Barker, how he was put away in prison unjustly so that the evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could have his beautiful wife Lucy.  Todd is free, and wants his revenge.<br /><br />From the ship he heads to Fleet Street, where his old barber shop used to be.  Beneath the shop is Mrs. Lovett's (Helena Bonham Carter) pie shop, where she sells the worst meat pies in London.  Mrs. Lovett finishes the tale of Barker by telling Todd that Turpin raped Lucy, after which Lucy took poison.  Barker's daughter was now the young ward of Turpin.  Mrs. Lovett recognizes Barker, and rents his old rooms to him.  Todd scares up business by beating London's number one barber, Adolfo Bamford, in a \\"shave-off\\".  Now business takes off, but Todd's most wanted customers have yet to arrive; Judge Turpin and his lackey, Beadle.  Subplots unfold as Todd and Lovett sort of adopt Adolfo's young servant boy Toby, and Anthony walks by the Judge's house only to fall in love with young Joanna, Barker's daughter, through the window where she sits all day, imprisoned in her own house.<br /><br />Being a Tim Burton film, the dark atmosphere is rich and uncontrived.  He brings a grimy gloominess to London, and the characters of the film.  I've never seen Depp or Carter look darker or older than they do in 'Sweeney Todd'.  While the filming is dim, the blood stands out bright red, making a remarkable play with color.  There are some awfully nice throat-cutting scenes, very bloody, but I was hoping for a little more gore.  The plot fit very well with being a musical, and I love the little song Todd and Lovett sing when they figure out how to dispose of the bodies.  (Who would have known Depp could sing, or Rickman for that matter?)<br /><br />The fact that 'Sweeney Todd' is a horror movie AND a musical is interesting, to say the least.  The plot is good and the acting superb.  Burton did a wonderful job with this film.  Watch out for a delicious surprise ending, too.  This movie is definitely worth a purchase, as long as you don't mind musicals or a little blood.  Enjoy!he fact that 'Sweeney Todd' is a horror movie AND a musical is interesting, to say the least.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased Jillian Michaels 30 day Shred DVD about 30 days ago and have found the excercises to be simple and easy to follow.  The program fit easily into my schedule and is definately working.  I would highly recommend it. It provides a pace for beginners and the more advanced and is truly awesome.
0451196716|4.0|This was a fun book to read.  Obviously it is very plot-driven, with the theme being the whittling down of 100 contestants in the long walk down to 1, but in between it takes some time to be though provoking - as you dig into the psyches of people who are on the border between life and death.    Clearly this was written early in King's career, and it's a bit raw, but for this subject matter that somehow seems appropriate.  Perhaps some of the characters are a bit too black and white, but even that's OK here - if you imagine the conditions they're under, you can see how extreme behavior might erupt.    Reading this book will make you think about life and death a bit, and about how hard humans will push themselves to keep going.  And at the same time it's fun all the way through.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Love the packaging for this great, ahead of it's time sci-fi masterpiece.  Still like the original, rather than the re-issues.
0385340540|3.0|On the whole I enjoyed this book, though it wasn't balanced.  It started strong, and interesting I felt.  But it got a bit slow in the middle when it started to seem a bit too overwhelming on the Italian culture stuff, and not much going on in the plot or even characters.  Then it got really, really good for a while during the \\"chase\\" near the end - one of the better Grisham sections I've ever read.  The ending was somewhat soft, though logical.    I think that the entire \\"love story\\" angle was forced in and not really needed or even really appealing.  Francesca was an important character as she helped Backman get out of Italy safely, but I didn't feel any real chemistry between their characters.  Actually overall the characters here weren't very great - pretty cardboard, now that I think about it.  This was a plot-driven story.    But the chase sequence, maybe 60 or so pages between leaving Bologna the first time and his arrival in D.C. was very gripping, and fun to read.    Like most Grisham, it was popcorn.  Fun to eat (read) but not very nutritious.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Overall, it's a good cd.  Her voice is so soulful & powerful, so I doubt I could really be disappointed with anything she sings.  I do wish she would have put a new song on the cd instead of \\"And I Am Telling You...\\" In my opinion, I don't think this cd is going to get her that grammy she is hoping for because there isn't a \\"stand-out/crossover song\\" on the cd. And everybody knows that in order to gain mass appeal/success, you have to have crossover a.k.a. pop appeal. I hope I'm wrong, I would love to see her get a grammy to go along with her oscar.    Fav tracks:  Spotlight  Giving Myself  Can't Stop the Rain  We Gon' Fight
0451197968|5.0|Wow, this was just a fun book to read.  There isn't much depth here, which I usually look for in a book, but it was such interesting action...beginning to end...that I'll give it 5 stars even though it's not going to change your mind or your life or your philosophy.  It was just fun.    Of course, the ending came as a total surprise to me and was really interesting given events that came long after the story was written.  I was actually in shock as I read it happening.    Not much else to say - this book was incredibly fun from start to finish.  Just not deep...
B001DHXT2U|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. The action was true to the comics and i thought the special effects were much better than that of it predecessor. (Hulk)  I like how they re-did the entire cast and added the brilliant Edward Norton and the beautiful Liv Tyler. On a final note i just want to say that The Incredible Hulk is great movie and if you havent seen then you need to.
0385339100|2.0|Continuing with my John Grisham binge (which I'm so not proud of, but I continue on with it anyway), I read this book, just randomly selected among many Grisham books at the local library.<br /><br />I would have to say that this was my least favorite Grisham book so far.  I found the characters uninteresting, the story uninteresting, the storytelling uninteresting.  Just not one of his best, in my opinion - seemed like this one he cranked out just to meet some obligation to the book company.  The minor twist at the end was enjoyable, but not enough to save the book.  I just didn't like the style, tone or storytelling.  For example, I figured after chapter 1 (when Patrick gets caught) they'd go back in time to give some details, rather than only progressing forward.  But it wasn't meant to be.  Really didn't enjoy this one much, just slogged through it.
B00008XEOI|3.0|I'm a little at a loss for words... this set is almost $100 and it doesn't even include the other Lion King sequels?  I love the Lion King movie, but sorry, I don't think any movie is worth that much money (no matter how many extra-never-before-seen-interviews-songs-videos there are).
0765357151|3.0|Wanted to read this and see how it compared to the movies.  Really this is the I am Legend tale and then a collection of the author's other works as well, which I have yet to read.<br /><br />Overall, it was a little too much 60's theory that man is controlled by his urges not his mind for my taste but it was nice to see the payoff at the end to understand what the author really wanted the title to be.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I am enjoying this CD although, I do wish they had used the complete songs, and not just the parts used in the movie.
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|I grew up with this film in its various incarnations on home video.  And, yes, i probably own it in practically every format.  But this version really packs a punch.  It is really spectacular to see the crisp images from such a gritty film.  You would never know this movie is now 30 years old by the Blu-ray transfer.  The only element that was somewhat disappointing is that I noticed the audio dropping out occasionally, probably due to imperfections from the original mono source.  Otherwise, you will find new details in this film that you never noticed before on this great hi-def version!!!
B001D08SK0|4.0|Hey, this disc is only going to be 50 years old once and not really until next year, the same year I will be 50.  The two audio CD's sound fantastic.  The 58 Sessions stuff sounds better than the KOB disc and that is saying something.  I could do without the false starts and studio chatter but it is I guess a historic document that adds something to the package but not necessarily to the audio experience.  The DVD is an interesting addition.  I had seen the interview part of the disc on TV some time ago.  The performance segment is also worth watching.  How would you like to have been one of those cats sitting in the folding chairs getting paid union scale to back up Miles and Trane.  Great stuff.    The discs aren't scratched as one reviewer put it (maybe his were) but the way they are packaged scuffs the discs with a mark that does not affect the playback or sound of mine.  One star off for cheaping out on the jewel boxes.    The photos are a nice touch.  Suitable for framing?  Not quite.  The bound book is interesting but I have not gotten around to reading it.  The poster does nothing for me and I don't have a vinyl rig anymore so can't comment on the sound quality of the LP other than to say it's BLUE VINYL.    A curious combination of items to be sure.  Would I have done it differently, definitely.  Is it worth the money, hard to say but it is a very special package of a very special group of jazz musicians that put down some classic tracks that will be listened to for the next 50 years.  Would make a great birthday gift for a jazz lover turning 50 this year or next and Xmas is right around the corner.    5 stars for content and sound quality.  4 stars for everything else.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|With the new television season in full swing I find myself bombarded with a plethora of new shows vying for my attention, few will actually succeed in gaining it in the end; however, as many new shows try to become new favorites of mine, I still remain loyal to the ones I've enjoyed from previous seasons. One such show that became a favorite of mine last season was the Fox network's mid-season replacement \\"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\\". Now that the new season of this show has gone on for a few episodes, I recently found myself wanting to re-watch the original movies that spawned this entertaining weekly sci-fi series. So, I got out my Blu-ray copies of the Terminator trilogy and had myself a thrilling, action-packed, sci-fi weekend of machines bent on destroying humanity.    \\"The Terminator\\" is set in the year 1984 where a young woman named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is trying to make a life for herself; however, that life may soon be cut short as a deadly cyborg, called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), arrives from the future to kill her. As it turns out, Sarah is to eventually give birth to a boy who will one day grow up to become humanity's last great hope for survival against the onslaught of these seemingly unstoppable killing machines. Now, Sarah is in a desperate struggle for survival for not only her own life and that of her unborn child, but also for the future of all mankind.    Science-fiction movies when done well can be extremely entertaining pieces of cinema that on occasion become important facets of our popular culture. Prior to 1984, the Star Wars and Star Trek movies were the two biggest science-fiction franchises ever to be made. That is, until a little known director named James Cameron released a movie starring a former Austrian body builder that would become the first true blockbuster for both men's careers, and cement Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cinematic icon, causing his character to become one of the most quoted and recognizable characters of all time.    The story for \\"The Terminator\\" is a blend of both present day (well, back when 1984 was present day) reality with that of a dark, bleak future where humanity's days could very well be numbered. The concept of having a cybernetic killer come back from the future to end the life of an innocent woman and her as yet unborn child was an intriguing one. It was made even more intriguing by the introduction of her protector (Michael Biehn) who was sent back in time by Sarah's very own son to protect his mother and prevent the Terminator from succeeding in its mission. Talk about a mind-bending storyline. An interesting element within this movie is that the future may not be set in stone, which introduces some really interesting consequences into the story depending on what happens; therefore making the movie feel a bit more unpredictable and original than one might expect from the genre. It was nice to see that even back in 1984, long before the recent crop of sci-fi/superhero films set against a realistic, modern day backdrop, writer/director James Cameron was smart enough to create a fairly realistic world for his characters and his far fetched idea (although it doesn't seem nearly as far fetched with today's technology) to exist within. Thus, allowing us in the audience an easier time of relating to these characters who find themselves in this bizarre situation.    Leading the cast for \\"The Terminator\\" we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, who found great success as one of Hollywood's new action heroes in films such as, \\"Predator\\", \\"Commando\\", and \\"Total Recall\\", and all of it was due to his star making performance in this movie. The fact that Arnold became such a big star from this movie is actually somewhat surprising to me given the fact that he barely speaks in his role, shows zero emotional range (which is appropriate given that his character is a cyborg), and isn't exactly challenged in a physical way either. Regardless of all of this, Arnold still managed to create a villain that instills fear by being this ultimate killing machine, not to mention the eerie way in which he systematically scans a room is perfectly robotic and creepy at the same time. All the while you'll find yourself wondering is this possibly the future of our machines with the way A.I. is becoming more and more advanced these days. Just a little bit strange to think about, isn't it.    The supporting cast led by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn was surprisingly solid, providing intriguing characters that were easily accessible, allowing for us to quickly begin rooting for their survival and ultimate success against the onslaught of the Terminator. Linda Hamilton (\\"Dante's Peak\\") was given the most to do out of everyone within the cast. Over the course of this movie we see her character run through a wide range of emotions; from happiness to fear, from fear to surprising romantic bliss to an eventual undeterred resolve. Linda proved in this movie that she was definitely star material, by creating such a three-dimensional character that began the movie as a virtual nobody and ended it poised to become this virtual warrior-like woman determined to raise her son to be the one man that could save humankind from extinction. Along with Linda, actor Michael Biehn (\\"Aliens\\") created a very human, yet at times almost superhuman hero in Sarah's protector, Kyle Reese. His devotion to not only his mission, but also to Sarah, was a nice twist to the character, because it made him into a much more realistic hero. Normally in movies like this the hero is one that knows exactly what to do in every situation, and nine times out of ten Kyle was very much like that, but there were those moments where he clearly was flying by the seat of his pants, and just hoping for some miracle to occur to save both him and Sarah from the machine hunting them; it was this very human aspect to his heroic character that made him stand out more than what your typical action hero would have in any other movie.    Lastly, writer/director James Cameron did an excellent job of creating a visually thrilling science fiction experience with a significantly smaller budget than anything produced in movies or television today, and yet still his visuals hold up better than most from that time. That is as much to do with the excellent work on behalf of James Cameron and his crew as it is with the talented people working with Stan Winston to create the stunning, yet sometimes frightening images of a future where machines rule over the humans with an iron fist. Granted there are moments within the film where it definitely shows its age, and the practical and visual effects definitely look dated; however, given the time at which the film was made the results are still impressive even by today's standards if you really stop to think about it. It would be nice (and I'm sure purists will disagree with me on this) if some of the weaker moments in the visual effects area could be tweaked/redone similar to what George Lucas did to his original Star Wars trilogy. I'm not saying to tweak the effects to the extent that George did, but there are definitely places where if an improvement could be made the movie would definitely benefit from it, and would feel more in line with the technological advancements made in between this first movie and its sequels.    Overall, \\"The Terminator\\" is an excellent science fiction thrill ride that grabs you early on, and only occasionally slows down long enough for you to catch your breath before quickly rushing forward once more. With an outstanding story, a surprising cast, and mostly solid visual effects work, this is a movie that kicked off one of the greatest sci-fi movie series' of all time, and should definitely be on everyone's must see list!    \\"The Terminator\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.
B000009EAD|4.0|Let's start with the fact that I like Iced Earth a lot and I use to think this was their best album.  But after many plays I realised there are some really bad songs on this album.  Don't get me wrong this is still a very good album.    The really good songs to name a few are 'Burning Times', 'Disciples of the Lie' and the Something Wicked Trilogy.  Their are some killer riffs in 'Prophecy', 'Birth of the Wicked' and 'The Coming Curse' (Which ends with a nice piano outro).  'Disciples of the Lie' will make you break out into windmill headbanging.  '1776' is a Iron Maiden influenced musical, and if you pay attention Jon uses the Iron Maiden gallop guitar playing quite frequently.    The Bad: 'Watching Over Me' this song is not very good, a repetive chorus ruins it for for me.  It's not becuase it's a ballad (Melancholy isnt a very heavy song but is still a very good song).  'Stand Alone' is another one of those repetitive chorus lines, although fun to sing a long too, it get rahter annoying.  'Reaping Stone' a  kind of bluesy song that really never get going and is rather boring.  Dropping 3 songs from this album and making it 10 would have made this one of their classic albums, like 'Night of the Stormrider' and the 'The Dark Saga'  And since I brought up 'Night of the Stormrider' since Jon is so obsessed with re-recording albums why doesnt he re-do Night with Matt singing the entire album.    Anyway a really good album with a few flaws.  Buy this album now!
B001CIPU3G|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I have been a Trivum fan since they first came on the scene with 'Ember'.<br /><br />I was thrilled with the first two albums by this remarkably talented band. They instantly mastered a genre they helped create in metalcore, and showed that said genre didn't have to be about kids screaming over top of power chords.<br /><br />The Crusade was a throwback to a dead genre that did not do justice to the band's talent or intensity. A copycat album, The Crusade was something straight out of 1984 and showed to well how a band could be tempted into sounding exactly like the idols that inspired them to begin with.<br /><br />I was tempted not to even buy this Shogun, but I was willing to forgive The Crusade if it was just an aberration on their evolution, and so it seems it was.<br /><br />Shogun is a good album. It does not measure up completely to Trivium's first two albums, but is at least uniquely them. Dark and eerie, Shogun showcases phenomenal musicianship with lackluster vocals that are sadly becoming Trivium's norm. Heafy's voice is not bad, but he does himself no favors by writing lyrics he has to stretch to meet verse. Heafy is under the impression that he can sing, scream, and yell very well, so he tries all on this album. His screaming has matured slightly,
0375842209|5.0|A heartwarming tale that grabs you by the hand and never lets you go till the end. This is a tale of a pre-teen girl living and growing up in Nazi Germany. It tells of her joys and sorrows and the interesting people she meets along the way. As the title implies, she steals books. The young girl in the story thirsts for knowledge and so begins her book stealing career as a way to understand the world around her. I personally loved this book because it delves into the \\"other\\" Germany--the people who had no choice or say in their government's policies and atrocities but were in many ways just as much victims as Germany's other enemies.   The story is told by death and he/she/it constantly interrupts to give the reader certain insights. I found that off putting at first and I was really irritated by the constant interruptions. But it gets better either because I began to mind the interruptions alot less, or because the interruptions become less frequent. The story will make you laugh and there were times that I thought that my heart would burst cause I was so tense. I almost cried during certain scenes cause you feel the lack of humanity in some people and the surprising boldness of others to take a stand for goodness. A delightful tale and I would highly recommend it.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This movie is the story of how a billionaire playboy becomes a superhero in a metal supersuit. It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice. Because...he's Iron Man. :)<br /><br />IRON MAN was not one of my fave comics growing up in...er...many years ago. I was more into the X-Men and Daredevil and The Flash and The Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange. When I heard they were making Iron Man as a film with Downey, my first thought was, \\"Huh? Downey?\\"<br /><br />I should accept that when someone can act, they can ACT just about any role. Downey can act. (I always feel a little sad that so much time and energy was sapped by his substance abuse demons, when he could have been playing many more roles.) He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner. From there, the billionaire boink-fiend becomes a man with a...heart. In more ways than one.<br /><br />The second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit. OH MY GOSH! I want one. They managed to make the laughable bright suit I remember from my comics-riddled youth into something cool and effective and...sexy.<br /><br />The effect of his \\"heart\\" is also quite nifty, though less complex.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is somehow lacking her usual shine and spark here, but she isn't ineffective. I just know she can do better--and I like her a lot--and I was slightly disappointed that she was so, so...not up to Downey in this.<br /><br />POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS follow...you are warned:<br /><br />I didn't like Bridges as the corporate baddie. (Oh, come one. We all know he's the baddie from the first scene, right?) I find he's an actor who's either very on and works, or who's very off and sucks. I think he pretty much sucks here except for one scene. Ah, well.<br /><br />On the plus side, there is humor (Stark's quips and sarcasm and sass is irrepressible) to go with the dark stuff (ie, torture, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.<br /><br />Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.<br /><br />The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)  The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.<br /><br />The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.<br /><br />When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either  sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.<br /><br />And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.<br /><br />Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.<br /><br />Mirre, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.    Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.    The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)  The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.    The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.    When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either  sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.    Oh, yeah.     And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.    Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.    Mir
B0000VCZK2|5.0|What can I say - not the directors cut, but more stuff than any other Aliens pack available- and with a GREAT price from Amazon.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I loved it! its fun to watch and gives me a title I can enjoy with my kids with something that I grew up with. Just like the old carton but made more modern.
0061245097|5.0|Cat is your average girl-next-door, except for spending her evenings luring and killing evil vampires.  One of those evil vampires raped Cat's mother; he was newly turned and therefore was able to impregnate her... with Cat.  Cat's mixed blood explains her unusual strength and her special attraction to trolling vampires.    In the first book of the series, \\"Halfway to the Grave,\\" Cat develops a relationship with a vampire called Bones.  In this second book, they work together to tackle a criminal industry run by vampires - and local politicians - involving the kidnapping of young women.    The plot moves along well, and the characters are irresistible.
B00005YXZH|4.0|As many nice things as you can say about it (and there are plenty), there is one flaw in this album that continues to bother me. In a word, it's the noise. Don't get me wrong, I like a little static and feedback--what indie rock fan doesn't? It's just that it works better with some songs than with others. Wilco works hard to create a mellow, organic vibe, and it's kind of confounding when they suddenly shatter it with a grinding belt sander. Basically, they try to do two styles at once, and while every good record needs a little diversity, I feel that there's really nothing binding the alternative country half to the avant-garde noise-rock half. Rather than complimenting each other, the different elements seem to pull in different directions.<br /><br />So now I've written a basically negative review while giving the album four stars. I suppose it's because all the good stuff has been covered by other reviewers on this page. I actually do like all the songs, including some of the noisy parts. It's just that some sections must have been more fun to make than to listen to.
0891419195|5.0|I have told people that war is the Second worse thing that could happen to a human. The first? Slavery - which is the battlefront against Hitler's National Socialists and the Imperial Japan in World War II.<br /><br />That's where this story takes place. I have read few books that convey the realism and horror of war so well, without reservation. This is one.<br /><br />Eugene B. Sledge, an Alabama boy, heads into War in the Pacific as a member of the U.S. Marines. He lands with the famous 1st Marine Division - 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. His training was concentrated and intense - but still nothing prepares one for the onslaught of Pelilieu. He was a vet when he hit Okinawa where the fighting got even tougher. The image that sticks with me about Okinawa is a Marine who has to head back to get ammo. He slips in the mud and slides down the hill, rising to discover that he was covered in the maggots uncovered by his slid that were gnawing away at the dead bodies in the mud. This Marine, inured to death and destruction, is rattled badly. That image has stayed with me to understand the horror of this generation's sacrifice and their quiet acceptance of Duty.<br /><br />By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic.
B000W91RUG|4.0|The Big Bang Theory is definitely a must buy. It's one of the funniest TV shows I've seen in a long time. Every, and I mean every, episode I watch I always laugh. Solid nerdish comedy - I love it.     I would have given this product a 5/5 stars but... When I received the DvDs, one of them was scracthed. It had small lines across the disk. It still plays well, but I am still upset about it. I'm not sure if it was during the handling process or something. It's not that big of a deal since the DvDs play just fine.    If you love nerd-like comedies, I would recommend this DvD. And for price of only about $20 for a complete season, it's hard to find a better deal.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The musical is not my genre of choice. I prefer classic film-noirs which are about as diametrically opposed to musicals as a genre can be. That said I enjoyed The Sound of Music immensely. The songs were very moving and fit the storyline perfectly. Speaking of the story, unlike the case in a lot of musicals, the plot in The Sound of Music does not exist simply to move the film from one musical number to another. It is a truly memorable romance story that will stay with viewer long after the viewing experience. The entire cast is superb (the kids are adorable!). This was Julie Andrew's coup de grace. It deserves all the accolades (including multiple Oscars) it has received. Strongly recommended!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This was a easy to watch, find yourself in it kind of movie, the actors were great to look at and the story was filled with are you loyal to your family at all cost, or are you true to yourself.  I did like the end, this is one I will watch over and over again.
1423101464|4.0|These books are always enjoyable. I've been a mythology enthusiast since I was a kid and am still a sucker for creative variations on Greek Myths. I had to particularly laugh at the Sphinx who ditches the traditional riddle contest for a standardized test. Her lines are classic.    \\"Think? How am I supposed to test whether you can think?, that's ridiculous!\\"    \\"If you won't pass, you fail. And since we can't allow any children to be held back, you'll be eaten!\\"    \\"My grading machine! I can't be exemplary without my test scores!\\"    OK, I'm a teacher. I probably found this much more amusing than the kids that this book is targeted toward.
B000000I3O|5.0|Happy Horrorween, everybody.  With horror film reviews coming from all corners of Amazon in this unholiest of months, I've decided to focus my attention elsewhere for a change.  After all, I'm always in horror mode.  Right now, I'm in the mood to pimp my favorite sounds of the season; the stuff that oughtta be in your CD player and on your iPod this month when you aren't glued to the couch watching your beloved DVD's of favorites from Halloweens gone by or scanning your cable guide for the season's must-DVR gems.  Welcome to my parade of all-time favorite horror/rock albums.<br /><br />Numero uno.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present the often imitated but never duplicated masters of horror/punk, The Misfits.  From hell they came!  This is their first of two best-of albums and contains a concentrated dose of horror love filled with ghoulish lyrics, fiendish guitar, and the unmistakable voice of the Satanic Elvis himself, Mr. Glenn Danzig.  The band often gets tagged with the \\"hardcore punk\\" label and at times it is apt, but The Misfits are surprisingly listenable and their sound most often resembles [[ASIN:B000002LLG The Ramones]] more than any hardcore band.  Heck, you could easily sing along with most of the songs which often have instantly memorable melodies.  With song titles like \\"Vampira\\" (an ode to the star of [[ASIN:6305466661 Plan 9 from Outer Space]]), \\"Astro Zombies\\", and \\"Wolfsblood\\", how could a horror fan go wrong?  In case you think their references coy, they'll occasionally flat out name a song after a classic flick like [[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead]] or [[ASIN:B00009XI5F Die! Die! My Darling!]].  When crooning lyrics like \\"I want your skull\\" and \\"they called us walking corpses/ unholy living dead\\", Danzig is the ideal horror/rock frontman and the music could not fit the mood better.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on this CD include the low production version of the aforementioned \\"Vampira\\" that appears on this disc (which is comprised of alternate versions).  You just can't buy that kind of guitar sound. \\"London Dungeon\\" is a one-of-a-kind tune that actually doesn't blitz you with buzzsaw guitars, but instead oozes through your speakers to create a menacing atmosphere while caressing your ears with primitive rhythms and Danzig's effortless delivery.  And of course, \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight\\" is arguably their biggest classic.  \\"Bullet\\", which can only be described as a twisted love song for the assassination of JFK, is yet another standout track on an album of standout tracks.<br />Have a gander at these lyrics:<br /><br />\\"President's bullet ridden body in the street<br />Ride, Johnny, ride<br />Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete<br />Ride, Johnny, ride<br />Johnny's wife is floundering<br />Johnny's wife is scared<br />Run, Jackie, run<br />Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead<br />Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head<br />Texas is the reason that the president's dead\\"<br /><br />I personally can't think of anything more tasteless, can you?  Moving on.<br /><br />While the music is timeless, the CD itself hasn't aged all that well and is long overdue for a remastering.  It'll sound cool in your CD player so long as you're used to old-school punk production values (or lack thereof), but if you plan on putting it onto your iPod you may want to download MP3Gain or another program that allows you to raise the digital playback volume to match the more modern music on your MP3 player.  This is my only complaint.  I'm still scraping money together for [[ASIN:B000000I2W The Misfits Box Set]], which contains all the tracks from both collections and much more for a Halloween present for myself, but if you're looking to get your first dose of The Misfits than this is a pretty good place to start.  It isn't the original versions of the songs, but considering the number of tracks on this disc compared to the albums proper, this is better bang for your horror/punk buck.  Any andall punk rock fans must pay homage to these guys, and horror fans should hail them as well.  Nobody has ever done either like they did.d hail them as well.  Nobody has ever done either like they did.
055358894X|1.0|This book so far has been great however halfway through the book there is a printing error that ruins the book right during one of the best parts.  The pages are cut off at the top of the page meaning you only get half of the page then the bottom half of the page is printed upside down and has nothing to do with the top half so you miss out on about 40 pages of the story.  I would suggest buying the book as it is really good but go to a books store and flip through the book to make sure its printed correctly look at pages 389 to 420.
B0000549B0|5.0|I LOVE HARVEY. This is one of my favorite movies ever. I love that it keeps you guessing as to whether Elwood is insane or not until the very end. There are also a lot of good quotes in this movie. My favorite being:<br /><br />\\"Years ago my mother used to say to me, \\"In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.\\" Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.\\"<br /><br />This is a great feel-good movie and James Stewart does a fabulous job as Elwood Dowd. Nobody could do it better.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This blu-ray edition of this exceptional classic movie is really the best. The color and clarity are clearly superior. I can enjoy it like it was in the movies.
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|*** 2005. Written and directed by Duncan Tucker. Two Academy awards nominations (song and actress) and Golden Globe earned by Felicity Huffman. A transsexual, on the verge of being operated must drive across the U.S. in the company of his son, a juvenile delinquent. Clich&eacute;s and clich&eacute;s. The redeeming and edifying road movie is a common theme of American cinema; just think, for instance about Don Siegel's [[ASIN:B00008CMT4 Two Mules For Sister Sara]] (cowboy and nun) or Barry Levinson's [[ASIN:B0000YEEGM Rain Man (Special Edition)]] (yuppie and autistic person). The only original element of TRANSAMERICA is the decision to ask an actress to play a male would-be transsexual. Apart from that, nothing new under the sun. Already forgotten.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This is hard movie to rate, it's interesting to see once for the FX, for the designs, for the production.  It was one of the first films to use a 'digital backlot' with almost no sets or props just blue screens and computers.<br /><br />The idea is also fun, it's a homage to 30s serials with a high-flying ace in his super plane and a spunky reporter tagging along as he travels to lost civilizations and battles a mad scientist.<br /><br />But Sky Captain is horribly miscast, Jude Law sleepwalks through this never having fun, never bringing any energy to the part.  A film like this calls for an over-acting scenery-chewing he-man instead it gets a calm, polite understated Englishman.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|When I heard about Alter Bridge, of course I was eager to check them out because....[Looks around nervously.] Okay, I admit it. I'm a Creed fan. There. I said it. Anyway, Scott Stapp was only one member of the group, and I was sure that the others had made equal or greater contributions. Unfortunately, I didn't think One Day Remains really demonstrated that. For one thing, love him or hate him, Stapp had presence. I didn't really feel Myles Kennedy did. There are really only a few tracks I listen to from One Day Remains with any regularity (\\"Find the Real,\\" \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" \\"Watch Your Words\\"). (Admittedly, they're really, really good.)<br /><br />Then this album came along. Right off the bat, it just sounded right on. I really don't know how else to describe it. Everything really clicks on this one. Somehow, Kennedy found that presence I had thought lacking, and everyone else stepped up their game accordingly. Tremonti's riffs are more memorable and his solos more impressive. Scott Phillips's drumming is more intricate. (I'm never good at picking out bass guitar parts, so I don't really know what to say about Brian Marshall. I do give him props, though, for listing Tool's Justin Chancellor as an influence and Faith No More's [[ASIN:B000002LRX Angel Dust]] as one of his top five favorite albums.)<br /><br />While there may be a few tracks I tend to skip, the overwhelming majority of this album just blows me away every time I listen to it. I struggle to say whether or not this album is superior to any of Creed's, but I'm really leaning towards yes. I suppose time will tell. All I know is that, right now, I can't get enough of this.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: \\"Come To Life,\\" \\"Buried Alive,\\" and \\"White Knuckles.\\"
B001C08RHA|5.0|\\"Iron Man\\" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than \\"Spiderman\\" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />As the first film in the franchise, \\"Iron Man\\" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work \\"mediocre\\", but I have to admit that \\"Iron Man\\" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series.

031606792X|2.0|I still can't believe how neatly everything wraps up for Bella, Edward and all the other central characters (Cullens, Nessie, Jake, even Charlie and Sue!). So much more plot was thrown into this last book (in contrast to the three previous books which mostly crawl at a snail's pace until something finally happens in the last 50-100 pages) but much of the storyline was far-fetched and ridiculous even set within a fictional vampire/werewolf world. I feel ripped off for devoting so much time and energy to a book series with such a predictable \\"fairy tale\\" ending. It seemed as if the author just ran out of steam after 700+ pages and could think of nothing more than what was the most obvious. Stephenie Meyer should have delivered a *real* ending and not something so convenient and contrived. The readers deserved something better!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is my second favorite Austen book and movie. The story is wonderful, and this production is subtle and perfectly paced - just like the book. The choice of actors is perfect - just as I imagined when reading the book for the first time.

0765318741|5.0|It is perhaps the greatest novel written on human loneliness. It far surpasses Daniel DeFoe's Robinson Crusoe in that regard. Its insights into what it is to be human go far beyond genre, and is all the more surprising because, having read his short stories- which range from competent but simplistic, to having classic Twilight Zone twists (he was a major contributor to the original tv series) there is nothing within those short stories that suggests the supreme majesty of the existential masterpiece I Am Legend was aborning.<br />  Not only is it more than a horror or sci fi tale, it is more than just a post-apocalyptic work as well. It is (written in 1953, and published in 1954) a far more subtle allegory on the McCarthyism of the day, as well the rigid conformity of the 1950s leading to the cultural sterilization and death of the masses. Compared to such filmic fare from that decade, as On The Beach- or its written source, or even The World, The Flesh, The Devil, it stands even higher because criticism from either side of the spectrum, politically- the idle and gullible Left and the vicious and pandering Right- was generally heavy-handed and obvious. Even when compared to later works, some with direct debts, like George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead, or those intriguing alternative visions to the end of the world- Ursula LeGuin's The Lathe Of Heaven (another great apocalyptic novel) or the 1985 New Zealand film The Quiet Earth, I Am Legend stands alone with its relentless focus on the self, and the relation to things exterior.<br />  It deconstructs the vampire myth with modern methods, attempting to explain many of its legendary aspects with science- such as why non-Christian vampires would fear the cross- they don't, why a stake kills a vampire but not a bullet- a stake allows corrupting air into the bodily glue of a vampire (although the silver bullet myth is untouched), why vampires can metamorphose into bats or wolves- they can't, why some vampires turn to dust at death- their already long-dead bodies instantly decompose while living vampires' bodies don't, why mirrors repel them- psychological traumas, and a number of others....a mark of any enduring work of art is its continued, and renewable, relevance through time. A half a century on Neville himself emerges as another sort of figure of the Right- not as the Van Helsing-like McCarthy, but the solipsistic, indolent corporate fat cats and paranoid, self-pitying Goddists of the Bush era. Like the modern Right believes itself to be, he is besieged in a redoubt, fending off the mindless drones of blood and hedonism (the harlot vampires `posing like lewd puppets in the night'), even as he is anachronized. He joys in small victories. He loses himself in an idealized past, fortifies himself with the remnants of a lost glory (Classical music), lashes out at his enemies with no regard to differences, and that some of them are far more like him than he admits, and loses himself in fantasies of violence and sex, not unlike the Timothy McVeigh crowd.<br />  Many questions remain at tale's end: Why did the New Breed have to wait so long to come and get Neville? Was Neville really the last man on earth, or just in LA, or his part of LA? Why were the dead and living vampires so dumb- even Neville queries why they didn't simply set his house on fire?<br />  We'll never know, and why should we? Have we been enlightened, entertained? Yes. That's all that a work of art need do. Too many modern writers go overboard with masturbatory detail, thinking that good writing consists of the curlicues of minutia, squared! The idea being that detailed boredom is better than plain old boredom. My wife has complained of passages in the novel Cold Mountain where the author, Charles Frazier, spends pages describing the details of Civil War weaponry, yet his characters are utter stereotypes. He doesn't get it. Matheson did in I Am Legend. There are gaps in the science of I AmLegend- they were apparent in 1954, and some of the science is even more manifestly dated now. But, it's still plausible, if not as real science fiction, certainly as fantasy, and truly as allegory, and the book's real raison d'etr&eacute;. Yet, a work can be wholly fantastical and succeed if its tale grips and its characters connect. Plausibility gives way to the motive- in both senses of what drives the tale and what the style accomplishes in doing so.<br />  That all said, I have no hesitation claiming that I Am Legend is easily one of the ten best novels I have ever read- right up there with Mark Twain's The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, or The Whale, Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, and a few arguments over a tale or two from William Kennedy and some others.<br />  And yet, somehow, I am still drawn to the Vincent Price interpretation of the Robert Neville character (called Robert Morgan in The Last Man On Earth), and my sonnet Vincent Price In The Drapery Folds, for that is where our deepest terrors lie- in the mundane, in the human tendency to see a curtain rustle and expect some ghost or nosferatu to be its cause, rather than a stray breeze. This is why `the divine chaotics of wish and snowflake' is so essential to science fiction and horror. It is the within, admixed with the without, however briefly (for snowflakes are amongst the most ephemeral things in the macro-world), where horror spawns.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|OMG, I just LOVE this series! It has everything: sex, violence, family conflict, references to the paranormal, and comments on race relations. And of course Vampires. I haven't missed a single airing since it began in September.    I think I might even like it more than *gasp* Heroes.  Only 4 episodes have been shown and I already want the box set!  I haven't read the Charlaine Harris novels (I plan to) so that won't affect your enjoyment of the series.  I hope there are lot's of extras included on the DVD's such as deleted scenes, cast and crew interviews, commentaries, etc.  And Stephen Moyer, Bill the Vampire, is totlly hot!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved the show on TV. I'm very happy to have it all, in an easy to view format!
B0000640VO|5.0|This is an instant classic. Directed with a retro and modern feelers entwined throughout every scene, Amelie pulls you in and again further still. This movie seems like a children's tale and would make a great film for such with proper edits. It finishes with a nice moral rub for shy or difficult to understand people embedded in a warm, gooey bed of personal satisfaction. \\"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\\"
B00005JPS8|5.0|I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.<br /><br />Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.<br /><br />And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.
6304458355|3.0|I love this movie, but it has one terrible flaw, and it saddened me greatly to hear it. When the grown boy is seeking the girl he once played with, he mumbles disparagingly that she is probably living in a trailer park.<br /><br />And with that snobbish aside, from a person I formerly respected as a humanist, a million kids - who live in trailer parks or the equivalent - were ushered out of the fun.<br /><br />It would be worth sending it to that company in Utah that edits out bad words and sex scenes, to get that cruel sentence removed.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Excellent movie, great PQ and AQ, no reaching for remote. Colors are accurate throughout, crisp, clear, no blocking or artifacts. The Audio is DD, TrueHD etc.. and is very clean, tight and mixed well. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job along with the others cast. The Live Update took about 30secs on my connection so I guess it's varied. This one is a buy and will be a great addition to your collection, you won't be disappointed. I have not perused the 2nd Bonus disc yet, will update then.<br /><br />J.A. Brony
B001AIRUP4|5.0|This Blu-Ray Disc version of The Nightmare Before Christmas is a must buy for any fan of the film. It has the most amazing picture and sound, along with plenty of extras to go with it. And at about the same price as the DVD, why not go with the Blu-Ray? I highly recommend this product.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|My father was born in Oklahoma in 1923 . His family left Oklahoma during the dust bowl for Arizona . This was his favorite movie as it reminded him of his childhood . I've watched this movie several times with my dad and its an all time classic of Henry Fonda's .
B000TNF7NS|5.0|I was a UFO fan when they were a current band. Like so many others from that era who didn't make it to CD right off I had forgotten just how good they were. This CD also has the uncensored cover which originally was recalled in the US and re-released with the image of the people on the cover changed to a near complete transparency. That aside, this like all the early UFO releases is solid, timeless rock and roll.
B001DJ7PQ4|2.0|i love the show but the prices beig charged for the box sets are to much for most to afford
B000TNF7OC|5.0|How this band faded into obscurity is beyond me. They were as solid and as hard rocking as any band from that early 70s era. It took a long time before their music went to CD and once I saw them i bought all their early works. A friend remarked he, like me, had forgotten just how good they were. And they are damn good!
0553131001|5.0|Of Mice and Men starts out as a quite confusing book, jumping straight into the plot,but it quickly picks up and gets you into the story.  It starts off with an immensely strong, yet hopeful brute tagging along a small witty man,who chooses to care for him. They are both very hopeful about the life they could soon make together apart from the rest of the world.  But in the end the brute-ish man, Lenny, is caught alone without George,the witty caregiver and loses control of himself. He ends up showing George that all the while there really was no hope at the dream-life, only that he had told Lenny it's work out so long, he started to want to believe it himself, and he did. Through it all George continues to want the best for Lenny...
0312427999|5.0|All I can say is that considering the recent Wall Street fiasco and resulting bail out Ms. Klein showed she truly saw the writing on the wall (pun intended!). But, it ain't over yet, unfortunately. As jobs continue to be lost sending more and more Americans to the unemployment and public assistance lines, as people continue to lose their homes, as few new jobs with a living wage are created, as energy and food costs continue to rise, and as health care becomes unaffordable and non existent to any but the wealthiest, something will need to be done. Economic Darwinism at it worst, intentionally orchestrated and waiting in the wings just like the Patriot Act was. This book is a must read!
B00008K7AM|5.0|This is a really awesome funny movie! It's like Rob Schneider's version of 'Freaky Friday'! A popular girl who takes things for granted named Jessica steals some cursed earrings from a store in the mall while with her hot girl-friends. They go to a gas station that's being robbed by Clive Maxtone. Clive pretends to be the gas station employee. Somehow, she drops an earring and Clive finds it. The next day, Jessica finds out she's switched bodies with Clive. She tries to tell her best friend April about it, but she doesn't believe her at first. Throughout the movie, a lot of hilarious situations happen such as Jessica trying to use the restroom standing up, and getting her boyfriend to believe. Across town, Clive is in Jessica's body and taking advantage of the situation by becoming a stripper and making more money. Later, Jessica learns some valuable lessons. If you have a great sense of humor, you'll love THE HOT CHICK!!!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent video/sound quality.  There is some graininess to the picture, but it is still sharp, clear, colorful, and vivid.<br />*Includes a vast number of great special features; 23 minutes of deleted/extended scenes, interviews, documentaries, stuff that explores Iron Man's suit, trailers, and a mock newscast by the Onion website.<br />*Smashing special effects and action scenes.<br />*Good, straightforward filming style. A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.<br />*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.<br />*Pretty good, straightforward story. Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.<br />*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to \\"Lord of War\\", but not as serious).<br />*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting. In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be. Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.<br />*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!<br />*Great sound effects.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*One or two slow parts. The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it. But it's still not too dull at all.<br />*Some violence may be too much for young children (rated PG-13).<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie. Much of the action and effects are quite memorable. The characters are not too shabby. The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening. Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing). It is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than \\"The Fantastic Four.\\"
B000PMG16U|5.0|Believe it or not I still own the VHS boxed special edition (now up for sale)I  jest knew that eventually Lucas would remaster on BD, Star Wars and now Indiana Jones. All I can say is WOW, can't wait.
B001E75QH0|5.0|This movie was awesome! He still has the touch to make action and comedy blend together. Sure, he's alot older now than when he did the last crusade, but that's the beauty of it. I think he's in great shape for his age and did alot of his own stunts in it. Shia, I could do without. I think he's a bit overblown. Lucas/Spielberg/Ford are talking about doing another one but even they admit they would have to hurry because Ford is getting any younger to do these sort of things. I love the way it ends. Lucas has already said Shia will NOT replace Ford. And the end proves it if you pay attention to it. It's masterfull the way they let the fans know there is and always will be one Indy!!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I first got hooked watching it online from a company that rents movies through the mail that also allows you to watch instantly through the interwebs.  I got hooked and loved the series.  The first season is great (IMO better than the second).  He appears more normal in the 2nd season and strayed away from his quirks.
B0000060NH|5.0|I love Marvin Gaye, everything he touches is a masterpiece. His music is everlasting and at times relevant, case in point-Inner City Blues. He is a master because he is a genius at what he does bottom-line. R.I.P Marvin Gaye, your music will live forever.
B0012Q732O|4.0|I rented 10,000 BC when it first arrived on DVD, and I, without embarrassment, really enjoyed it!  I had a couple of free coupons for Previously Viewed Movies at Blockbuster, so while browsing I came across this DVD at the local store and pounced on it like a big woolly mammoth! Upon checkout, the clerk asked me, \\"Have you seen this film?\\"  I answered, \\"Yes, and I really liked it.\\"  She shook her head and said, \\"I have to agree with all the bad reviews; it's not even historically accurate.\\"  I don't know about the rest of you, but I grew up in the 60's and 70's and caught sci-fi movies from the 50's and 60's en masse, as well as King Kong, Godzilla and monster movies!  None of those could ever be deemed historically accurate, but that's not why I watched them.  They were entertaining as anything offered today, and my friends and I still engage in our memories of watching Saturday B movies back then!  What FUN!  Does anyone here remember \\"Robinson Crusoe on Mars?\\"  An astronaut, crash lands on Mars, befriends a runaway slave whom he teaches English.  Along the way they eat and drink from Mars surface (and breathe as well) along with their pet Monkey, Mona.  Eventually, all three are rescued from the melting polar ice cap.  It was a suspended fun journey of disbelief, and to this day I remember that film fondly.  Ironically, I was reminded of the same fun journey of disbelief with \\"10,000 BC.\\"  I'll watch it again and again with all those other fun B movies I own.  That's why I enjoy films!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent book about life in Germany during WWII.  It brought back many memories of stories my mother told me about Germany before she was able to flee with her family to the United States.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|awesome cd received it very promptly thank you. unfortunately i am very short on time i have nothing bad to say about this product all very good
1932907009|5.0|I've been a writer for more years than I care to admit.  Thought I knew it all...or most of it.  For those of you who, like me, approach screenwriting with the notion 'hey, how hard can this be' only to be turned down time and time again by people you want to read your precious work; for those of you who read your screenplay and wonder what went wrong and how; any who read some of the structure books and scratch your head, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!        Unlike the other formula books on the market today, Blake makes screenwriting fun and exciting.  My first screenplay took over 32 drafts...just to get it readable! After reading Save the Cat, my next screenplay was three drafts for the reading copy.       So, for all of you veteran writers out there who feel frustrated by the complexities of the seemingly simple creative process of screenplay writing, I hope you will give this outstanding book a read. It truly is the only book you will ever need on screenwriting!
0743298039|4.0|I must admit that this book is not my typical reading material but I was intrigued by all the fuss and good reviews.  Although it started off a little slow, patience proved to be a virtue as the story soon found its stride.  The story is tightly plotted with wonderfully drawn characters.  The ending was quite satisfying - I find that I am often disappointed in \\"mysteries\\" when the ending comes out of nowhere or is too simply concluded.
B0017R5UAA|1.0|People, this is an average album by an average band. Yes, the melodies are pretty, yes, the guitars are pretty, yes, they have beards and they're from Seattle. Are you indie monkeys getting the picture here? You've just been sold another retro, throwback album. Why can't we just see these guys for what they really are? A bunch of dudes just playing some songs, no boundaries are being broken, no experimentation is on hand. The fact that people are viewing this as some kind of colossally new form of music shows me how gullible you all are and how willing you are to take whatever the media feeds you. It really isn't folks, maybe you guys have been hittin' those Lysol cans again, cause the fumes are killin' you! Having said all this, it's not an album to mock or put down, it's just not that special, that's all.<br /><br />Now I'm sure that this review will get all your pantyhose's in a bunch, railing me because I offended your indie sensibilities. Yes, I know, you really don't care what Pitchfork, Metacritic, Popmatters and all the other high-brow web sites say, I'm sure your opinion was formulated entirely on your own! Yes, you are unique & beautiful snowflakes free to judge this music without the influence of the perennial \\"loser in real-life that now looks down his nose at you because he works at an indie record store/website\\". Save your breath, go bother someone who actually cares what you think.
B000O178BY|4.0|It isn't my favorite CD; it definitely took a little warming up to, but I still think Trent is a genius.
B001GAPC1K|2.0|I wasn't able to play it until I looked up \\"Iron Man blue-ray issues\\" on the internet.  I had to turn the internet connection off on my PS3 to get it to play.  The movie was excellent but the 30 min of trying to figure out what the problem was rates it a 2!!
B000MRA5EM|5.0|I am not suprised at the negative reviews here since it has become the norm for nature shows to spread the very important message of the envirnmental tragedy happening.however,I think its gone to far.People will want to save what they love and if nature shows are always a heavy,depressing doom and gloom thing,most will simply not watch them.I know I dont and I am a conservationist.This show is simply fun and playful in its showing.It has cute moments as well and I know this has a bigger impact on peoples hearts.I think this is a simply delightful imax experience ,not for psudo-intillectual armchair types though.
B0000DYKET|5.0|The Keen Men's Newport Sandal is, without a doubt, the best shoe I have ever owned.  My pair is well over four years old and still going strong.  My local outdoor store has discontinued the line, and you cannot blame them: you buy a pair and never need to purchase another. I'm an active walker and would give you an estimate of the mileage except you would not believe me.  I'm unnecessarily ordering a backup pair, as I'm afraid Keen may someday discontinue the line.
B001BKXUOQ|1.0|this band sucks dont buy any of slipknots albums that also goes for    distrubed and coldplay do not spend any money on these people
B001F4SJRQ|5.0|I have owned and enjoyed many prior re-issues of this landmark recording over the years, including an earlier SACD version which up to now was my favorite. However, this 45RPM vinyl release is now the definitive statement on this masterpiece. Jazz lovers around the world know and love this record, so it needs no further comment here. The sound is warm, detailed and has a depth of which I have never previously heard on this recording. I must also mention that this record serves as an  introduction to the Amazon vinyl audience,to the incredible Acoustic Sounds label and online record shop. Now available through Amazon, they offer the finest high quality LP's, SACD's and collectable CD's you will find anywhere. Acoustic Sounds also provides the finest packaging for their LP shipments in the industry. Anyone into buying high quality vinyl should check them out. Bravo to Amazon for adding them to their vendor list. A first class expirence all around.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is simply beautiful.  IMO, Smashing Pumpkins is one of the great bands that came out of the 90s and honestly, no band today can compare to what Smashing Pumpkins was able to do.  Their music is so distinctive and unique that you know when it's a Smashing Pumpkins song you're listening to.<br /><br />Some of the songs on this album:  Disarm, Today, Rocket, Cherub Rock, and Mayonaise.  Frankly, the entire album is awesome, you can't go wrong buying this album as all the songs are incredible.  I'll just give a few thoughts of a few of the songs I mentioned.<br /><br />I think Disarm has a pensive and somber tone, with the strings giving an almost bittersweet sound, and of course Billy Corgan's unmistakable voice that just makes the song perfect.<br /><br />Rocket has a weird, odd rhythm to it, seems appropriate to the song, flying free.  It sounds out there and surreal, but in a good way.LOL.  I love the guitar riffs that accompany this song.<br /><br />Today seems to strike a very nostalgic chord, a lot of yearning and wistful.  Again, Billy Corgan's singing voice really captures this feeling quite well.<br /><br />Cherub Rock is loud  and will blow you away with its catchy guitar riffs.<br /><br />Mayonaise is my favorite song on the entire album.  I can listen to this song over and over again without getting bored of it.  The beginning guitar solo is haunting, exquisite, and so mesmerizing.  It's about a 45 second guitar solo and I think it's the best part.  The best part because it sets up the mood of the song so well, of an almost dreamy contemplation tinged with melancholiness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, heck you can't go wrong with Smashing Pumpkins, also check out their other albums, in particular Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness
B001DUKVGO|5.0|This high quality, 180 gram vinyl pressing finally restores the original dynamics of this landmark recording. Prior digital versions have always sounded flat, hard and highly compressed. If you enjoy vinyl or are trying vinyl for the first time, you can't go wrong with this record. The vendor provided excellent service, and the record arrived in perfect condition. Highly recommended.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|This cd is difficult to review.  I made sure I listened to it many times before writing this.  I am a huge Jennifer Hudson fan and don't necessarily agree that she so much had to prove she could sing with this cd as show she could be a competitive cohesive artist.  We all know she can sing.  American idol and DREAMGIRLS showed us that. (And we are reminded with the inclusion of AND I'M TELLING YOU I'M NOT GOING here.)<br /><br />Studios and producers can take a person with minimal talent and produce a very appealing cd that showcases them well.  Here we have a singer with amazing pipes and range who can carry an album by those qualities alone and what do we get?  Total overproduction and songs that are just not up to the caliber she deserves.<br /><br />The cd opens very promisingly with the single SPOTLIGHT with strong and emotive vocals.  Then IF THIS ISN'T LOVE comes on and the quality of song definitely diminishes.  It's very generic but Jennifer does get to show her strong vocals at the end.  POCKETBOOK with Ludacris is just silly and WHAT'S WRONG(GO AWAY) with T-Pain is ridiculous.  So unecessary and just does not work.  The static effect used with T-Pain is irritating and Jennifer merely floats through.  GIVING MYSELF is the first ballad and it is ok.  The song quality just doesn't cut it though and it works adequately.<br /><br />Halfway through the cd starts to come into its own.  YOU PULLED ME THOUGH is a better soulful ballad and Jennifer again gets to showcase those pipes.  She soars range wise and emotively in the duet with Fantasia I'M HIS ONLY WOMAN and CAN'T STOP THE RAIN and WE GON' FIGHT are both priceless - highlights of the cd.  She soars on both and showcase her amazing abilities as an artist.  Then INVISIBLE comes and it does just that.  It's a rather forgetful song.  Including AND I'M TELLING YOU doesn't really fit - it merely shows what Jennifer is capable of with the right material.  Even the final gospel track is ok - excellent vocal performance of an adequate song.<br /><br />I wish this had been so much more.  Clive Davis gets so much credit for his talent but his producing skills here get a very low grade.  He was given pure raw talent and he surrounded her with nonsense.  Never are Jennifer Hudsons vocals not supreme and heavenly.  This just won't be the cd to start the true music career she deserves and is capable of having.  There are not enough songs here to be singles and the set lacks any true continuity.  Noit to say I can't enjoy it.  I really do for I just love Jennifer Hudson's voice and abilities.  I just can't help but wish she had been dealt a better hand.  Till the next cd I will enjoy this one.  SPOTLIGHT, CAN'T STOP THE RAIN, WE GON' FIGHT and a few others will carry me through.<br /><br />This 3 star review is certainly not a judgement of the talents of Jennifer Hudson.  Those would receive a 5+, but rather an honest review of the material on the cd.  I do recommend purchasing it.  It is enjoyable and she will become a legendary talent in time.  Enjoy this in the meantime.g.    I wish this had been so much more.  Clive Davis gets so much credit for his talent but his producing skills here get a very low grade.

0439023483|5.0|I puffy heart loved this book!     Why? (Without giving anything away)     It had a compelling plot, intriguing characters (especially the main girl), very interesting dialouge, it was funny, a little romance, and it was clean (even though \\"The Hunger Games\\" were too the death.)     It was science fictiony without wreaking of normal science fiction elements (parasites, alien ships, etc). It reminded me of Stephenie Meyer's \\"The Host\\" in that way. Not your normal science fiction book. Also, it had a similar affect on me that the \\"Twilight\\" book did. The writing was very good like Stephenie Meyer's books and it made me care deeply about the characters involved. By the end, they felt like my friends. Sometimes it reminded me of the \\"Uglies\\" series although it is much better written. Sometimes it reminded me of watching \\"Survivor\\" but much more real.     For me, I would rank it just below the Twilight series but higher than \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty\\" which I also really enjoyed. \\"Uglies\\" goes down that list a ways.     I hope they make it into a clean but amazing movie!!! I'm SO there.     The hardest part of the whole experience is waiting for the next book in the series. Argh!
0099450259|5.0|Why spend a few good evenings re-discovering life through the eyes of an autistic boy? The answer to that lies in this intriguing novel. While most fifteen-year-olds spend their time playing basketball or crunching popcorn at the movies, Christopher Boone - our protagonist - prefers cracking difficult maths puzzles and investigating the death of his neighbour's poodle. The latter event eventually leads him on an adventure that forms the bulk of the plot - a discovery of the untold back-story to his parents' troubled marriage.     The main selling point of the book, however, lies not so much in the story per se as having the story rendered through Christopher's eyes. And what he brings is a wholly refreshing perspective on life - from the details he picks out with his unbelievably photographic memory to his manic obsession with order. How many people actually can - or will bother to - remember the number (and colour and size and disposition) of cows they've just seen on a random field? This raises serious questions about the things we `normal people' choose to see and not to see. The language too is perfect - methodical, matter-of-fact and well-suited to the subject matter and how our protagonist relates to it.     A truly refreshing and thought-provoking read.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Amon Amarth set the bar pretty high with their 2006 release \\"With Oden On Our Side\\" so I wasn't sure \\"Twilight\\" would reach that level. I was wrong. AA delivers again. If you are even a casual fan of Amon Amarth or Viking/\\"Battle\\" metal in general pick up \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" you won't be disappointed.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|The mini-series, John Adams, has restored my faith that there is high quality American entertainment intertwined with history out there. The tasking of taking David McCullogh's prize winning book of the same name into a spectacular mini-series can be overwelming. Of course, there will be things left out but I can't recommend it enough because it's so addictive. To begin with, Paul Giamati (Sideways star) transforms himself into John Adams, America's second President and first Vice PResident and America's first ambassador to Great Britain after the American REvolution. He is madly in love with his wife, Abigail, played remarkably by Oscar Nominee Laura Linney. Adams is not without his faults especially towards his three children, JOhn Quincy Adams who is his favorite, his only daughter Nellie (played by Sarah Polley) who married Colonel William Smith who thinks he can use the Adams name, Charles Adams as the disappointment who makes a fool of himself and the family name but suffers the most and marries his brother-in-law's sister, Sally Smith (played by Mamie Gummer who is Meryl Streep's daughter). and the other son whose name escapes me at the moment.<br />In other parts of the film, David Morse (St. Elsewhere) becomes George Washington and so identical to the man on our dollar bills that it's uncanny and strange all at once. Tom Wilkinson OBE plays Ben Franklin who is both genius and decadent in Paris. I don't remember the actor who plays Thomas Jefferson but he is memorable.<br />The mini-series is high quality and first rate that it would have swept the Academy Awards as a film but it was nominated for 23 Emmys, Giamati won Best Actor, Linney won Bet Actress, Wilkinson won Best Supporting Actor as Franklin but I would have wished there was a tie between him and Morse. It also won for Best Writing but lost for directing to a two hour film which was just wrong because this mini-series is perhaps the best things to watch in a long time.<br />I think this DVD shouldbe in ever history classroom in America. It makes you understand the American Revolution, the rise of American politics, and the humanization of the country's founding fathers.

158234082X|3.0|Maybe because I am a chef I did not find the book hilarious as would probably a person who is not in the business.  But, there were times when I found myself laughing out loud.  Unfortunately, not enough times.  I also found myself skipping paragraphs and a few pages.  I did not find it boring but it was too cutesy of writing.  I enjoyed how it showed his time line and if you put your mind to it you can succeed.  After awhile I was tired of his long winded decriptions of whatever he was trying to describe.  It was okay at first but then became trite. The book was 310 pages and it could have been successful at 200 pages.  I had to nudge myself at times to get through.  I enjoyed reading about his misadventures with incompentent owners which I could definitely relate to.  Also, enjoyed the makeup of the different cooks.     I would be reading and enjoying the book and I would think to myself that I was being too harsh on the author when I would get to the next paragraph and I would see that my original opionion of it only being 3 stars was correct.  I would reccommend this book to everyone because everyone has different tastes.
0394800389|5.0|This was the funniest book I have ever read.  I found it in the Doctors office and was going to check it out for my grandsons to see if I needed to order it.  I sat in the office and laughed out loud, then came home and ordered the book.  My daughter and son in law are also delighted with this book and enjoy reading to the grandchildren.
1400095204|5.0|Fantastic book on RELATIONSHIPS during the Nigerian civil war. When we were kids my (Nigerian) father would tell us stories about the 60's in Nigeria as he was also a professor at Ibaden. However, as kids we were never really intrested  in the past. When I read this book I WAS BLOWN AWAY at how a stranger (the author) had put into writing everything I had been told over the course of my childhood by my father. I felt like the author had substituted the names of the characters and had stolen my fathers stories. AMAZING. (I'm now 45) And I feel ashamed that I paid little attention then, because to me they were just storeis but they were not.
0385340990|5.0|I thought that I might be bored when I saw that the whole book was made up of letters.  However, once I read a few chapters, I was hooked.  The characters became so real through their letters and I loved every one of them by the time I finished.  I hated to see the book come to an end and would like to know what happened next to all the Guernsey characters. Any chance that Annie Barrows could write a sequel someday?  The story made me want to visit Guernsey but I would be disappointed not to find Juliet, Dawsey, Iola and all of the other residents not there.
0316067601|5.0|I have to say this book is an absolute MUST READ!  It is mind blowing what these men went through and the story that is told from it.  I don't think any movie could ever do this book or story for that matter any justice.  I would recommend this book to anyone, even war critics.  It's a real eye opener what these men have gone through across seas.
1582701709|1.0|Rhonda Byrne just did what alot of other folks have done...taking stuff from the last hundred years or so and reformatting it. It was boring. Having read all of Wallace Wattles, Og Mandino, Robert Collier, it was basically the same pitch, only filled with the same over and over tidbits from the other same people doing the same thing ala Chicken Soup for the Soul.  Basically what it says is, \\"Stop playing the victim and get into the right way of living!\\" How do you do that? By praying. Put yourself into a good frame of mind and ask the Lord for blessings, and be grateful.  Just remember, Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You.  Jesus tried to impart The Secret to his followers: You can have anything you want, you can do anything you want, you can be anything you want. Just believe in yourself and live as God intended you to live.  So, be a good doobie while you're here. The rest will fall into place.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|These \\"guys\\"  should have a lot to be angry about, but don't pull the trigger.  Remember when they were angry about WAR, and WORKING MAN PAINS!?  Where is the passion?  Oh yeah the \\"pass\\"ion is in the \\"pass\\"enger seat of the Bentley turbo?...Hey where is my bitch to wax it?  Try the new Megadeth, or Slipknot.  At least they have a grasp on reality.  I have loved METAL, and Metallica for a long time, and this stuff is hollow, like the last 4........ Remember CLIFF, or NEWGUY?  It makes me want to buy some Motorhead, AC/DC, or Suicidal to feel something, and not the Shook me all night long Dion CRAP!  My best advise to Metallica is to start drinking again, and call Dave to \\"FUEL\\" the fire again?!?!!!, and don't make a $appy, $orry movie about it to make gain$ on the people who you \\"LOVE\\"! I LOVE YOU MAN!! SCREW THAT!!!  Metal rules!!!! So give the power to the people, before I start buying POP 40 Hannah, or The top country count down stuff..........P
0553213105|5.0|This novel begins with one of the most recognizable lines in literary history:  \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"  With that begins, perhaps, the most copied plot-line in human history.  Sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett are of a marrying age.  When a handsome and wealthy young man comes to stay in their neighborhood, the Bennetts waste little time making his acquaintance.  It turns out the handsome newcomer, Charles Bingley, is a fine and friendly gentleman and he has a liking for Jane.<br /><br />Mr. Bingley's cohort, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is, however, not nearly so friendly.  Cold and formal, he quickly incurs the dislike of Elizabeth.  Mr. Darcy, though, appears somewhat taken by Elizabeth and makes some half-hearted advances.  Despite his great wealth, Elizabeth distaste grows the more she learns of Mr. Darcy's past.<br /><br />Just as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley appears set for matrimony, Mr. Bingley suddenly leaves the neighborhood.  Certainly, it seems, this is the doing of Mr. Darcy.  Jane's hopes dashed and Elizabeth finding only comically unsuitable suitors, the Bennett sisters are headed for old-maidom.  That is, unless the terrible events are due to improper pride and/or prejudice.<br /><br />Though I am not a great Jane Austen admirer and find much of her writing overly ornamental and preoccupied with unimportant subject matter, there is no disputing the greatness of this novel. The language usage is  clearly Austenesque, but this book is nevertheless genuinely a page turner.  Moreover, the tone is pitch perfect - touching the emotions, but maintaining an appealing comic feel.  I found myself delighted to be in the company of Jane Austen who, though her writing is over two centuries old and her experiences obviously much different from ours, has a surprisingly modern voice.<br /><br />Even more importantly, this book is an invaluable cultural gift. Though perhaps not in the same league as the Bible or some of Shakespeare's works, the influence of Pride and Prejudice on our culture is simply vast. Familiarizing yourself with Pride and Prejudice will make literally hundreds of cultural products more comprehensible (or reveal them to be unoriginal). The plot-line alone has spawned countless imitations, slight modifications and commentaries.  The characters, especially Elizabeth and Darcy, have become veritable archetypes. This is one of those stories that you are already familiar with through its imitators.  None, however, has done the material so well and so thoughtfully as Ms. Austen.<br /><br />Even if you don't have the stomach for Ms. Austen's other material, this novel is worth reading.  It's both good for you and an enjoyable read - often a tough mix to find.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Not only is the BD a pleasure to watch, but listen to as well.  Deep, vibrant color, crisp picture and solid blacks.  Hugo Weaving is mesmerizing, and Natalie Portman will have you convinced she's truly converted by the end of the picture.  5 stars!
B000QXDED6|4.0|I am not a lover of mindless or unnecessary violence but violence even worse than what is depicted in the movie actually did take place in history. War was a very gory thing in the past, a time when they did not have guns, bullets and cannons. War was more painful and bloody. Death wasn't instantaneous either.    The most important thing to remember is that 300 is based more on Frank Miller's novel than historical facts.    Using Special FX and computer graphics 300 shows warfare beautifully and in surreal colour tones. Watching a movie as this one wonders whether in reality the battles were so perfect. The action is gory.    However the bravery of Leonidas and his men cannot be forgotten. But what the movie does not mention is the fact that some 700 Thespians also laid down their lives after pledging their alliance to Leonidas. Some others Helots and Thebans also died for Leonidas although a good number of Thebans deserted him and defected to Xerses in the final moments of the battle.    Another important aspect that most war movies tend to miss and one aspect that cannot be avoided in a movie as this is supplies. In most war movies the audience is supposed to assume how food and supplies reached the soldiers, where they bathed (of course where/how they eased themselves cannot obviously be shown). Where were the 300 getting their food from? Are we to believe that Spartans in those times could do without food for days? That would have been ridiculous. In one scene Leonidas is shown eating an apple while his men are finishing off the wounded and the dying. But in all the shots of all his men there is no such scene as to where their food is coming from. An elaborate scene is not what is expected but certainly without food where did they get their energy   from. In more than one scene the entire lot or most of them are shown just with their armour, 6 packs, spears and swords.    In History one of the bravest stand off's took place when the Mughals were trying to capture the brave Banda Bahadur. When nothing worked for months, the enemies blocked and destroyed the supplies. The starving Sikhs killed their horses and ate them and finally when no food was available they surrendered and got killed. So cutting of supplies IS a major move in warfare.     One more thing that movies of the past aren't good at showing is this. In hand to hand sword or lance combat is it very possible to kill a man with just one stroke? Most of the war movies show it that way. Probably dispatching an enemy in one stroke was the quickest thing but that ain't the truth. Bear in mind that even a vanquished enemy soldier was made a fighter, to fight unto the death. So many a time more than one stroke of the spear, sword or dagger is needed to kill a soldier although the movie claims that the fighting-loving Spartans were the best of fighters or killers able to dispatch enemies with almost fatal single blows.    Leonidas's wife giving in to the advances of Theron and finally the confrontation with him in the Senate could have been avoided. The historically inaccurate Xerxes was also a let down adding unwanted glamour to the brave story.    Gerard Butler as Leonidas did a splendid job though.     Some other last stands are noteworthy to be mentioned. Perhaps the biggest in history is when it comes to the ratio of soldier vs the adversary (1:476) was the Battle of Saragarhi where just 21 Sikh soldiers, of the 36'th Sikh Regiment, then part of the British Indian Army, fought off 10,000 Afghans. All of the 21 soldiers got killed and were awarded the Victoria Cross posthomously.
B000ADWDF2|5.0|Each week, Wall Street Journal movie reviewer Joe Morgenstern lists his DVD Tip for the week. Typically, it's a subtitled gem overlooked by a domestic audience.  This week, it was director Susanne Bier's masterpiece, [[ASIN:B000OCY7JE After the Wedding]], a surefire Oscar winner had it not been for the unsurpassed brilliance of writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's [[ASIN:B000OVLBGC The Lives of Others]].  Ms. Bier's previous work, \\"Brothers,\\" is up to those same high standards.<br /><br />Though not an original subscriber to countryman Lars Von Trier's Dogme 95 manifesto, the best of that spirit infuses Bier's work - natural lighting and hand-held cameras give her movies a jarring, life-like feel.  Of course, the actors still have to make it work.  Leads Connie Nielsen, Ulrich Thomsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas excel here.  Of special note, Thomsen's Michael gives a devastating take on battleground horrors (about as terrible a scenario as you could imagine), PTS syndrome and its devastating effects on one family.<br /><br />For those of you disappointed in [[ASIN:B00114XTHA Things We Lost in the Fire]], Ms. Bier's US debut, but unfamiliar with her Danish work, I strongly encourage you to check out these two releases to see the greatness of which she's capable given the right material.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Universal Studios Home Entertainment, in association with Legend Films, Inc., honored Bing Crosby on the 31st anniversary of his passing this October 14th by releasing the definitive DVD / CD package of one of Crosby's most beloved films, Paramount's mammoth 1942 Irving Berlin musical masterpiece, Holiday Inn.     Universal digitally remastered the classic b/w film for it's 2006 release, with pristine picture and sound quality. They augmented it with bonus features including a video interview with Fred Astaire's daughter Ava conducted by Crosby & Astaire record producer Ken Barnes, a making of documentary, and archive audio commentary featuring the stars Bing Crosby & Fred Astaire recorded in the 1970's.     Now, Universal has gone a step further and made it a 3-disc box set, featuring the original b/w version complete with the bonus features aforementioned, an audio CD housed in a nifty '40s retro-looking paper sleeve of the commercial soundtrack recordings by Crosby and Astaire, as recorded for Decca Records in 1942 (including Bing's original hard-to-find 1942 recording of White Christmas), and now, finally, a striking new COLOR version of the film! Legend Films has done justice to this perennial favorite by painstakingly colorizing the film, utilizing the help of Jan Mucklestone, who was the personal sketch artist for Paramount costume designer Edith Head. This was obviously a labor of love, and Legend's attention to detail makes for a stunning visual.    Colorization has always been a controversial subject, with those for and against it equally passionate in their beliefs. However, colorization has come a LONG way since it's inception in the early 1980's. The late 1980's colorization of another of Bing's classic films, The Bells of St. Mary's, was a slop-shod embarrassment enough to turn anyone off to the process. So it was with a bit of apprehension when I first heard of someone daring to tamper with a national treasure like Holiday Inn. I quickly learned thatthis was different, something special, after viewing Legend Films' 2007 colorized version of the 1946 Frank Capra masterpiece It's A Wonderful Life. Then came a small screen video trailer for Holiday Inn on the Legend Films website. This in itself was impressive, but by no means does justice to the brilliance of Legend Films work.    The colors on Holiday Inn are vibrant and full, without being garish or obtrusive. The visual impact is breathtaking, particularly on the Easter Parade number, with Bing's sea-blue eyes all aglow in the close-up. This is how the film was meant to be seen, in all it's color glory. After decades of viewing it from grainy b/w prints on the late show, it's like seeing the film for the very first time! The colors in your mind come to life on the screen, just as you imagine them to be. Bing's corduroy sport jacket during the White Christmas scene is, as you would expect, a rich shade of beige. The curtain behind Bing during the 4th of July production number is spectacular in red, white and blue, as it should be. Not to mention those firecrackers glowing in orange and red hues during Fred Astaire's dance-ode to Independence Day! Once you see this film in color, you'll never want to watch it in b/w again!    You can't go wrong with this DVD set. Those who prefer the original b/w print, can have it, and those who prefer seeing it in color have that too, all together in one attractive package. It's a win-win situation. And to all those purists and nay-sayers who are dead-set against the colorization process, give Holiday Inn a chance. If seeing this wonderful film, in all the rainbow of colors each scene portrays, doesn't change your mind to what colorization can do, then chances are you'd rather not see ANYTHING in color, if it can be viewed in b/w! Bravo Universal Home Entertainment, and Bravo Legend Films! Let's see more of Crosby's classic films done up right in color!
0123694965|5.0|I've been designing games for more than 20 years and I've read a ton of books on the subject.  This one is unique.    Most game design books focus on teaching you how to make a good game, detailing what techniques and processes one must master to understand an audience, to design a product that will satisfy their needs and aspirations, and to work with a team to produce it. \\"The Art of Game Design\\" goes beyond that: It teaches you how to become a better designer.    Here's an excerpt from the Deck of Lenses' instructions (it's the deck of cards sold separately that illustrates the 100 design \\"lenses\\"):     How to Design a Game  Step 1: Think of an idea for a game (it's easy, it can be anything!)  Step 2: Try it out (no really - try it out - you have to play games to see if they work)  Step 3: Figure out what's wrong with it, and change it so it is better. Then go back to Step 2!    That's what game designers do, over and over again, until they're satisfied with the game or they run out of time or money. However, if there are lots of books out there that explain how to increase the quality of whichever aspect of the game you want to change, it's the first one that so directly and so thoroughly addresses the problem of \\"figuring out what's wrong\\" with a game at each iteration.  In the book, Jesse Schell presents one hundred ways of looking at your game in order to figure this out, one hundred lenses. Even if this number seems big, it really isn't, because the book covers every domain touched by design: from the nature of the playing experience itself, to understanding the player, the game mechanisms, interface, story, technology, theme, etc.  For instance, here's the sum-up of a lens taken at random:    Lens #82: The Lens of Inner Contradiction  A good game cannot contain properties that defeat the game's very purpose. To remove those contradictory qualities, ask yourself these questions:  - What is the purpose of my game?  - What is the purpose of each subsystem of my game?  - Is there anything at all in my game that contradicts these purposes?  - If so, how can I change that?    The book doesn't give answers but helps you ask the right questions. I think of this book as the Tao of Game Design, a path toward understanding, each step its own path that can be explored and perfected. The one hundred lenses are one hundred design domains in which a designer can become more proficient. Jesse Schell's knowledge, experience and talent are obvious when he clearly explains how to consider all these questions, why they are important and how they are linked together.  This book makes and helps me think. To me, that's the best things a book about design can do.

1401322425|5.0|I absolutely love Jamie's recipes, he is so enthusiastic about fresh, real food.  This book is wonderful and I will be adding it to the rest of my cookbook collection.
0792164903|5.0|I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. A few minor content flaws, but nothing to make a fuss about and overall, quite enjoyable, especially if you're into Halloween like I am.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this flash for my Nikon D40 and find this flash great for several reasons.  It is very compact (smaller than your fist), comes with a protective case, seems to be pretty fast (hence the name Speedlight I guess), and best of all it is multi-directional so you can bounce the flash off the ceiling for superior looking indoor shots.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Really great movie.  You will love it even if you aren't into the whole \\"batman\\" thing, as it has a sense of realism.  Definitely recommended.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I just loved this movie what a great fun movie for a girls night out so I was really excited to purchase this and was so disappointed that there were no bloopers and outtakes in this DVD....especially a 2 disc Special Edition copy.  It was clear these woman had a blast filming this and we all thought the bloopers would have been a hoot to watch....sadly none.  Also the box states extra film footage of Fergie singing...well if you blink you will miss that also as it was seconds long.  Still a fantastic movie for your collection.
0375826726|3.0|Tries to be ostentatiously wordy. Only parts of the book I enjoyed were the plot revelations, of that which are about 4 or 5 in this book.  The rest is just fluff.  And the ending is very anti-climatic and when you're finished you feel disappointed you spend so much time reading.  But overall, the action was described well and I enjoyed reading the last two hundred pages...<br /><br />I give it a 3 because I finished it and didn't totally hate it.  Reader beware, you will be bored.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|I ordered this on blu ray after hearing about its release and seeing the good price on Amazon. What a complete waste of money. I've seen better quality on non blu ray. This is one of the most grainy blu ray movies ive ever seen. Not worth the money or the effort. I cannot believe this is the best they could do with this movie. Its all hype and no sustenance. Save your money and dont buy this.    Since I first received this I have bought a few \\"older\\" movies as well to see how they compare to this. I picked up A Clockwork Orange and also The Shining. How could they have messed up Godfather so bad in comparison? Both of those movies in Blu Ray are not even in the same ballpark as the Godfather \\"restoration\\". To me the studio and Coppola are doing nothing but ripping off the public with this version as it is just horrible. I stand by my original review and marvel at the loss of $62 on crap.
B000V6JAWW|4.0|Complete Clapton being Clapton's 2007 compilation showcases both his work with Cream, solo work and collaborations with other artists, i.e., J.J Cale. On this collection we got a mix of great, good and not so great songs. Cocaine is a great track, Layla, White Room, Promises and After Midnight. In the good category go tracks such as Pretending, Badge and Wonderfull Tonight. The not so great is short,and consists of but one track. This track in question, that I never ever liked is Change the World. This track is so schmaltzy. It sounds insencere and phoney. The book-let is alright. Nigel Williamson's short bio on Clapton is well-written and quite informative. Still this is a nice collection/compilation that should not be missed.
B001BKXUOQ|3.0|A little soft for me but not horrible..... my expectations were too high. I totaly forgive them for a few of the songs because they make up for it in concert! I've been to many concerts (back to the 80's) and they continue to put on one of the best shows I've seen!
B0019T9FL6|1.0|This CD was a big letdown.  I only liked 3 songs.    For her next cd, she needs to do a Pop album.  Here are some good song choices for it (I threw in a few good R&B tunes):    Lean On Me by Melba Moore  People In Love by Lulu  That Man Is My Weakness by Rita Coolidge  Cry Like A Rainstorm by Linda Ronstadt  I Need Love by Nona Hendryx  Sweet Harmony by Maria Muldaur  Luckie by Laura Nyro  He Lives In You by Diana Ross  How Can I Ease The Pain by Lisa Fischer  I Don't Know How To Love Him by Helen Reddy  Keep This Heart In Mind by Bonnie Raitt  Lose Again by Linda Ronstadt  Wild Nights by Martha Reeves  Come Tommorrow by Barbra Streisand    She should pick a producer among the likes of:  Richard Perry, Peter Asher, Ted Templeman, Lenny Waronker, Tom Dowd.  With these songs and producer(s), she will have a winner.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|I LOVE this show. It is worth keeping in the house to watch over and over. However, when i bought the disks they were scratched even though they were brand new! I couldn't even watch the season finale because the routing menu wouldn't work. I exchanged the disks with amazon for new ones and the new disks did the same thing. It must be a manufacturing error. Just be aware.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I love Sex and the City.  I am a huge fan.  I own all six seasons and anxiously awaited the movie's big day view.  I thought it moved a tad bit slowly, in the beginning, but the plot was good and interesting enough to keep your attention.  If you've followed the series, you know, it wouldn't have been Sex and the City if everything went smooth and peachy with no drama on Carrie''s end.  For those of you who didn't enjoy the movie, oh well.  I felt the scripts were well written and the scenes were very realistic.  Definitely a great movie to add to your collection.  If you're a fan or just want to sit back and watch, as my friend call it, a great chic flic', get this movie, it's  worth it.
B000002C25|5.0|I will never understand why oasis get's bashed by critics. Do they sound like the Beatles? Yes. Do they have over inflated egos? Yes. Are they one of the all time great bands? Yes. BE HERE NOW is nothing short of a masterpiece. Do not listen to critics, or to Noel(his ego will not let him say he likes this album.) Every song is great and will be remembered by us fans forever.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|This work is what I consider the only true new rhythm and blues on the airwaves. Neo soul does not work for me. While it is a new album the songs and singing styles are from the 70\\" which is so great to hear.  In previous work Al seemed to be stuck between gospel and R&B, but he is clear on this album 'cause it is all about R&B. Also there are great duets. I wish I could hear more of it on the airwaves.
0618001905|5.0|This is a brutal history of the colonization of the Belgian Congo beginning in the 1890's. Long after slavery was unilaterally condemned on the planet earth, we find that King Leopold and the tiny country of Belgium has managed to take ownership of a chunk of the African continent, claim it for its own and ransack its people and resources for his own benefit.<br /><br />Belgium felt they were being left out of the colonial expansion of Europe into Africa and wanted their piece of the action. They found the Congo River area an ideal source of rubber and cheap labor; a perfect location to set up shop which they did with the help of vicious mercenaries and Belgian company men. The book goes into horrible detail about the methods the white colonialists and their hired African mercenaries used to extract these resources and the labor that made it so valuable.<br /><br />How could this happen?  Where was the rest of the world? Well, believe it or not the United States inadvertently helped Leopold. A senator Sanford from the state of Florida, on the floor of the house, recognized the Congo as a Belgian territory. This simple recognition of a countries imperialistic expansion left the door wide open for Leopold to continue his atrocities under the guise of a legitimate Belgian state. It took decades for the truth about this brutal state to be known.<br /><br />The implications of this episode in history bear some resemblance to today's debate about the benefit of the US negotiating with known terrorist states like Iran and N Korea. If a super power comes to the table of negotiation with a rogue state, the rogue country wins recognition even when nothing is accomplished. Unless pre-conditions and terms are negotiated, which make the meeting of mutual benefit to both parties, these terrorist states need to be marginalized and shunned by society at large.
0446677450|5.0|For me this book started it all. My Mother-in-Law sent this book to my wife to read, I took it and consumed it in 1 day. I've never read a book so fast.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The item's content was of course, excellent.  The movie did come unhinged  during shipping, which caused a loose, shaking noise inside before I opened it.  I had to prevent the movie from hitting the floor when I opened it.  Haven't actually watched the movie to inspect visual damage....more to come.  Ok..opened it...all was well.  The movie is grand as usual.  A must for anyone's movie library.     Robert
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Director Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"Magnolia\\") achieves something very rare in films, he manages to create a really extraordinary film whose main character Daniel Plainview played by Daniel Day-Lewis (\\"My Left Foot\\") is for the most part reprehensible. With the exception of rare moments of affection for his deaf son, whose deafness is caused by an accident at his father's oil wells, Plainview cares for no one on earth, hates most people, is highly competitive and filled with unstoppable greed and ambition.<br /><br />The film is based on a novel by Upton Sinclair OIL and is set in the early decades of the 20th century when a lot of Americans acted like Plainview-- to a lesser degree we hope-- in their quest for wealth at whatever expense.<br /><br />The critics could not get enough of this film. Daniel Day-Lewis earned an Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Plainview. While he is supported by good performances by other actors, notably that of Paul Dano (\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\") as the hell-fire minister of the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli Sunday, the film ultimately belongs to Day-Lewis.<br /><br />In addition to his statement about greed, Anderson also shoots a nice arrow into fundamentalist, crazy religion. The soundtrack works very well, particularly the use of the beautiful Brahms Violin Concerto.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how this film holds up in the years ahead, but for now it is still white-hot.
2090338482|4.0|First, let me say that I love this series of workbooks from CLE. I've used at least six of these, having purchased three and using the rest in a classroom setting. Even so, I give this book 4 and not 5 stars because the \\"progressive\\" element to the Grammaire series is quite small. I finished the orange beginner Grammaire Progressive in my beginning French class and found that this book repeated too much material (with little additional detail) from the orange book. While it's true that progressing levels of language class will often cover prior material, this book does so too much. If you have not read the orange book and are not a complete beginner, or you are a complete beginner but also a motivated learner, I would recommend this book. If you've read the orange book, I would not recommend this book, but perhaps the next level up (a green book?). This is what one of my French instructors recommended to me - unfortunately after I already bought this book - but I have never used the advanced book so cannot recommend it one way or another.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|This album was basically a unique voice, experiencing so much pain, but doing it in a lovely manner.<br /><br />The title song was not ideal for a starting song.  It was a little annoying and bland.  Warwick Avenue is a strong song, despite it's somewhat depressing tone.  It's like a song you'd find at a pivotal moment in a musical.  The message is gorgeously portrayed.  Serious is kind of like a dreamlike or trancelike song.  It's kind of light at first.  It probably would have been a better first song than Rockferry.<br /><br />Stepping Stone kind of echoes the sounds of the great Carole King.  Very good message to girls, and it's a good girl power song without being bubblegum.  Syrup and Honey starts off kind of with a sing-song sound.  It was cute, but it still continues the blues sound.  Not as strong of a character built by Stepping Stone.  It sounds cute, but the message is lacking.  Hanging On Too Long is another song about a girl who is clingy.  A little bit stronger than the previous track, and focuses on the strength and range of her voice.<br /><br />Mercy is upbeat.  It is clear why this was chosen as the first single, but does not represent the album at all.  It's fun and clearly written and performed.  It is an interesting blend of pop and blues, and sounds like it could have come from the 50's, 60's, and today because of the mixture of sounds.  Delayed Devotion is another song that seems to have a hint of Carole King in it.  It's kind of like stepping into a sad moment in a 70's sitcom or comedic movie.  It's pretty, but a bit unoriginal soundwise.  The lyrics are cute, though.<br /><br />I'm Scared sounds like it comes from the 60's.  It's kind of lilty, though; while simultaneously being a bit sad.  It sounds like more of the classic clinginess that is present on this album.  It makes me wonder if she has self-esteem issues.  She sounds like she gets too attached.  Distant Dreamer sounds like it comes from a 60's or 70's musical.  It's pretty and very open-spirited, but it is too beautiful to be on the album.  It doesn't fit with the sad tone of most of the songs.  It's very optimistic for an album of pessimism.<br /><br />The songs sound great, but it's too much of a mixture of messages.  She seems to be skipping from clingy to hopeful to independent and back to clingy.  The album makes her sound too flighty as a person.beautiful to be on the album.  It doesn't fit with the sad tone of most of the songs.  It's very optimistic for an album of pessimism.    The songs sound great, but it's too much of a mixture of messages.  She seems to be skipping from clingy to hopeful to independent and back to clingy.  The album makes her sound too flighty as a person.

B000EQ4G5K|3.0|It's playful, but a bit unfulfilling.<br /><br />SOS is fun, playful, though I found it very annoying.  It's redundant, moreso than it needs to be.  It does not progress.  It's also childish.  Kisses Don't Lie starts off like a sing song type tune.  It progresses quite well and is more mature than SOS.  It is still able to be considered fun, though being more soulful.  It seems like it would be easy to dance to with a catchy hook.<br /><br />Unfaithful is both beautiful and sad.  The lyrical content is lovely, a bit poetic, but some people seem to take the murderer lines a little too seriously.  The background is also gorgeous.  It's easy to see why this song was a single.  It is beautifully symbolic and very mature.  We Ride is very interesting, but the background clashes with her voice and makes it difficult to listen to.  Perhaps a different background would have been more appropriate.  It reminded me of Destiny's Child, only it seemed to be more childish.<br /><br />Dem Haters had kind of an island feel, which made it fun.  It was bland in some spots, though, but overall was a pretty good song.  Final Goodbye, on the other hand, was a very pretty song, but was very sad.  It almost seemed like it could be a funeral song, except some might think it was inappropriate to play a Rihanna song at a funeral.  It was very solemn, and beautifully written.<br /><br />Break it Off had some more of the island feel, which made it more danceable.  It was kind of juvenile, though.  Crazy Little Thing Called Love also had the same feel that Dem Haters and Break it Off had, and seemed appropriate for teens falling love, but not grown ups.<br /><br />Selfish Girl continued the island feel.  It was an interesting sound, but her voice was too whiny in the song.  She sounds like a spoiled brat, instead of a selfish girl.  It sounds like something a five year old could have come up with.  PS (I'm Still Not Over You) has a bit of the sing song tone to it, but it's a better song than some of the stuff on her album.  It is, unfortunately, too quickly paced for the content, and seems like something you'd find on the back half of a Britney Spears album.  It's cute, but it definitely could have been better.<br /><br />A Girl Like Me starts beautifully, but quickly it becomes obvious that it's going to get worse as it goes on.  When the tempo picks up, it seems completely out of place in terms of what a good song is supposed to sound like.  Just too quick to be good, and makes her seem like she's in a rush.  A Million Miles Away starts lovely and sounds romantic to someone not paying close enough attention, but is a bit sad when you begin to look into the deeper meaning of the words.  She showcases her voice quite well.  My only complaint is her enunciation on some of the words.  If It's Lovin' That You Want - Part Two  is another dance song.  It has a bit of a bitter and unfulfilling beginning.  It gets a little better.  The lyrics are a bit childish and a little annoying.<br /><br />The album is okay.  Nothing too special, but the ballads are awesome.  It's a little boring, but much of it is childish.  It sounds like it was written for kids, but marketed to adults.

B001FB55TO|4.0|HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is one of those quirky British films that won't be remembered as one of the best you've ever seen, but is worth a look and four stars because, as I said to my wife after our advance screening, it \\"has its 5-star moments\\".<br /><br />The protagonist is Poppy (Sally Hawkins), a frenetically happy, 30-year old, primary school teacher living in London's northern reaches with her roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman). Poppy's good humor is so inexorable that, while it serves her well with her young charges, it often abrades the patience of adults. Only Zoe is imperturbable.<br /><br />As with other films of the genre ([[ASIN:6305558205 Local Hero]], [[ASIN:6305622914 The Full Monty]], [[ASIN:B0001I55M4 Calendar Girls]], [[ASIN:B00000ILEC Waking Ned Devine]]), the plot revolves not so much around events as the personalities and eccentricities of the players.<br /><br />The single best overall performance is perhaps that by Eddie Marsan as the scarily intense Scott, Poppy's driving instructor, whose deep-seated, smoldering anger at the world reflects a tightly wound mental state 180 degrees opposite that of his student. Confined together in the small space of Scott's car, an explosion seems always but a hair-trigger's pull away.<br /><br />Definitely, the single best scene, the one that had the audience in stitches, is played by Karina Fernandez as a Flamenco teacher, when she attempts to describe to and inculcate in her class of adult students the passion necessary for the dance. Talk about meltdown!<br /><br />The conflict, if it can be called such, of the story comes as Poppy's happy-go-luckiness scrapes up against the unhappy lives and internal turmoil of others: the mentally unstable derelict she encounters under a bridge in a bleak industrial section of the city, her pregnant and subliminally unhappy younger sister, a bullying and disturbed boy in her class, and, above all, Scott. As the last scene fades into the film credits, the viewer is left wondering if Poppy's felicitous worldview will survive life. One suspects it will.ve life. One suspects it will.
0452289963|3.0|Eckhart gives a positive message and a great philosophy on how to live life. I thought half of it was padding though. I was particularly put off by the constant injection of quotes from Jesus/Buddha/whoever to \\"prove\\" a point yet completely ignoring or lacking any context. It gets a bit \\"hippie\\" but the concepts are valid.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's view of Britain in the 1960's was a groundbreaking film that appeared at a time of turmoil and change in the lifestyles and mores of the Western world.  Britain ruled supreme in pop music (Beatles, Stones, Animals) and in fashion (Mary Quant, Twiggy, Carnaby Street).  The jazz stylings of Herbie Hancock were used as the soundtrack for the film, but the live Rock performance in the film was performed by the post-Clapton Yardbirds with Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page.  To reflect the London fashion scene, Antonioni used the German model Verushka in a simulated photo shoot that has been called the sexiest scene in film history.    (As an aside, Verushka's real name was Vera and her father was one of the German army officers who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1944; with the failure of the plot, he was executed and his family was interred in labor camps.)    When I first viewed this film in 1967, I was enormously impressed.  The photography was brilliant and the audio was the first \\"surround-sound\\" I had ever encountered.  (During the park scenes, I kept looking over my shoulder to see what birds had gotten into the theater!)  When I again saw this film about 1975, it looked dated and out of fashion.  Now, more than 40 years later, I see that it is a true period film that reflects much of the character and thinking of the time.    David Hemming's character in the movie (known as \\"Thomas\\") is not satisfied with his success as a fashion photographer and wants to become a \\"reality/documentary\\" photographer in the genre of Dorthea Lange or Henri Cartier-Bresson.  To this end, he pretends to be a street person and spends a night in a doss house, a sort of cheap barracks accommodation with shared sleeping and bath facilities.  Thomas sneaks his camera into this establishment in a paper bag and surreptitiously photographs the other guests as they shower and dress in the morning.  The clicking and whirring sounds of his camera and the stop-action showing the photographs that were produced constituted the opening scenes of \\"Blow-Up\\".  Thomas intends to use these and other such photographs in a book that he hopes will establish him as a \\"real\\" photographer.  For some incomprehensible reason, this entire opening sequence has been deleted from the Turner/MGM DVD release.  Instead, the movie opens with Thomas leaving the doss house in the morning, after the original opening photography sequence.  In the original movie, Thomas then returns to his parked Rolls-Royce, places his camera in the glove box and drives away. We viewers are surprised; is he stealing the car?  This scene has also been deleted. In this DVD release, he suddenly and inexplicably appears, already driving the Rolls down the street.    With the deletion of the movie's opening scenes, it is difficult to make sense of some of the later scenes in the film.  At one point, Thomas meets with his publisher (an early appearance by Peter Bowles, later known for his performances in \\"Rumpole of the Bailey\\", \\"To the Manor Born\\" and \\"The Irish RM\\") and reviews the photographs he had taken at the doss house.  This is the only brief chance viewers of the DVD have to see anything of the opening scenes.    Those opening scenes are important because they set the theme of the film.  Thomas first appears as a down-and-out man, but turns out to be far from it.  Viewers are put on notice that they can never be sure what is real and what is make-believe.  This continues through the film's final scene, where the make-believe of the mimes' tennis game becomes more real than the murder that Thomas accidentally photographed.    The DVD is marred by additional deletions.  Thomas develops the roll of film he shot in the park, studies the photos and sees something. (We viewers never really see what it is.)  He makes a series of larger and progressively blurrier enlargements.  Finally, he makes his largest blow-up, examines it, and instead of hanging it out in the open as he had the others, he conceals it between a pair of cabinets.  This seems a fairly long sequence in the original film and it is only later that we learn of its significance.  Of course, the name of the film comes from this scene.  I can only assume that Turner/MGM felt this sequence was boring and deleted most of it from the DVD.  When Thomas later finds his studio has been robbed, we don't even know what was taken or why he has this one enlargement left.  There are other odd little deletions here and there in the DVD; perhaps there were some bad frames in the original film from which the DVD was made.  When I purchased the DVD, I expected some of his romp with the two young \\"wanna be\\" models to be deleted.  I did not expect the evisceration of the basic theme of the film by the deletion of the important opening scenes.    I might describe this DVD as a \\"Bowdlerised\\" edition, but perhaps \\"Turnerized\\" may be more correct.  The DVD includes commentary by Peter Brunette, an academician. author and presumed expert on the films of Michelangelo Antonioni.  I have carefully listened to his commentary twice through, and can only conclude that he never saw the original film.  His comments refer only to this DVD edition.  At one point in his commentary, Mr. Brunette notes that the clothes worn by Thomas at the doss house mysteriously disappear.  Yes they do, because of another nonsensical deletion!    I would not normally recommend a DVD with so many deletions, but it seems that this flawed DVD is the only version of the film that is currently available.  To see it in this form is better than to not see it at all.  I give it 3 stars instead of the 4+ that the original film deserves.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|How anyone could give this less that 5 stars is crazy to me.  I haven't always been a huge Alanis fan, but I am now.  From start to end  the album offers insightful lyrics that are easily relatable. Im listening to the album as I type, and it just fills you with emotion. I find that is so hard to find these days with the music market saturated with hip hop and \\"artists\\" like Fergie where you can write anything retarded and people seem to buy it.  The musical production is also genius on this album. Every song sounds different and swells with a catchy chorus. This is the best album of 2008. Buy it!
B0015FML06|5.0|This is a great and very honest record! and, as someone here said before, it was made at a time when U2 wasn't that monster that is now. In terms of music, this is a pure, total and absolute rock and roll album. Damn! wish I was there...compared to the Pop Mart or the Vertigo tours, \\"Live At Red Rocks\\" is superior. It comes 25 years later to justify why U2 is among the greatest bands in rock. Personally, my favourite songs are \\"An Cat Dubh\\" - \\"Into The Heart\\" and \\"11 o'Clock Tick Tock\\".<br /><br />Recently, when it was released the DVD \\"Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago\\", it was those two songs (An Cat Dubh/Into The Heart) the ones that meant something for me, because I saw a moment of true communion between The Edge and Adam Clayton as long as they were playing those songs...it was like both of them were transported for one moment to the 1983 days...days of honesty and rock and roll.<br /><br />That's what \\"Live At Red Rocks\\", the DVD, offers...honesty and rock and roll. Buy it, the packaging is nice and if you already have the remastered versions of the first 3 albums, then you got to complete the collection.

B000001DYJ|3.0|My Kiss fandom goes back to 1976 and apart from the classics I really enjoyed some newer stuff like the \\"Rock the Nation\\" DVD and of course all the Kissology DVDs etc. Favorite Kiss albums include Kiss, Hotter Than Hell, Alive!, Destroyer, Creatures, Unplugged, and Revenge.  But \\"Alive III\\" just never sat well with me.  I always had the feeling, from the very first play, that it was WAYYYYY too cleaned up in the studio.    Out comes Kissology Volume 3 and.... guess what?  The Revenge Tour footage in that boxed set is the same concert used for most (if not all) of \\"Alive III\\" and you can CLEARLY hear the differences.  No doubt about it, they overdubbed A LOT of vocals for \\"Alive III\\" and it's less lively because of it.    The only track I really play over and over from \\"Alive III\\" is \\"Watching You.\\"  It's great to hear that classic played by Gene, Paul, Bruce, and Eric Singer.  They really were probably the most talented performing lineup overall.    I was really glad to have Eric Carr in the lineup, but as a drummer myself I'm convinced that Eric Singer was really the finest drummer the band had on stage.  He's very precise and rocks hard but he doesn't go for lots of self-indulgent slamming around.  Very crisp, like Alex Van Halen at his peak.    So I say, for the performances just watch 'em on Kissology 3.
0670020745|5.0|This is a very \\"insightful\\" book - a must read.  Well written, highly understandable and uplifting.
B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" is a great album. It consists of catchy, unpretentious British Invasion pop songs and you really don't think it would be that good but it is. The only song I dislike is \\"Drive My Car,\\" but everything else can be listened to over and over. Slower, more contemplative songs like \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" sweet love songs like \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Michelle,\\" jangly pop \\"If I Needed Someone,\\" and more aggressive numbers like \\"Run for Your Life.\\" This album is just plain solid all the way through.
B00001OH7G|5.0|\\"Irish Tour\\" was essentially Rory's \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" moment. FM \\"AOR\\" (\\"Album Oriented Radio\\") stations grabbed on to this one and would not let go. The 10 minute live version of \\"A Million Miles Away\\" accounted for the majority of airplay, especially on San Francisco's legendary station KSAN.    The album begins with a tightly-wound guitar riff that has more than a little Angus Young around the edges: \\"Cradle Rock\\" is one part roadhouse blues, one part arena rock, and a great opener.    \\"I Wonder Who\\" offers more blues, featuring a call-and-response tease of a minute or so between Rory's vocal and his guitar, before the band slowly joins the song. At the 1:45 mark, everyone's on board. Over the course of 8 minutes, there are ample solos and the rise-and-fall volume dynamics that are key to live blues dynamics.    \\"Tattoo'd Lady\\" is a mainstream rock song, on the fast side of mid-tempo, with more tight soloing.    \\"Too Much Alcohol,\\" another 12 bar blues stomper, begins with Rory's signature slide playing. Many dabbled with slide, Rory was one of the few masters of the art. The song then benefits from an audience hand-clap backbeat (fortunately, they are in tempo with the song). It's just Rory and his guitar again, with the band coming in at the 2 minute mark.    \\"As The Crow Flies\\" is an acoustic blues, breaking things up a bit and setting the stage for the next track, the classic \\"A Million Miles Away.\\" The song showcases Rory's talent as a guitarist and his ability to inject influences outside of the expected blues genres. This was one of those 10 minute \\"get lost in it\\" tracks, like Paul Butterfield's \\"East-West\\" and a few others, that had a beginning, a middle \\"adventure,\\" and a ride back home at the end. 34 years later, it still packs a punch.    \\"Walk On Hot Coals\\" veers from the pensive mood of \\"A Million Miles Away\\" into another 11 minute track that plays off of shifting tempos but is more of an aggressive rocker.    \\"Who's That Coming\\" brings back the slide, and this one's Foghat-style road rock, essentially a framework for the band to jump into a propulsive jam.    \\"Back On My Stomping Ground\\" is another slide-fueled track, more measured and laid back than some of the longer jamming tracks, and a very satisfying finish to a powerful set.    34 seconds of \\"Maritime\\" close the album, similar in spirit to Santo & Johnny's legendary \\"Sleepwalk.\\"    Simply put, this album belongs in any serious guitar rock / 1970s rock collection. Rory deserved much more mainstream recognition than he got in his lifetime, but the music still lives on, loud and strong.
0316143472|5.0|This was a nice read--but, a little different from other David Sedaris books...not in a bad way. This book is about David's adult life...
1582701709|1.0|Read it and placed it aside.  Listen, if you want anything worthwhile in life you have to be persistent and go out and work for it.  God helps those who help themselves. I read another book titled The Key to the Secret by James De Havilland and believe me it is great. De Havilland teaches that unused capability becomes the lost capability therefore you must unfold your own capability.  He doesn't tell you to simply believe, he tells you to \\"do\\".  That's my opinion.
1400079179|5.0|An absolutely amazingly fascinating book. It has made even the most die-hard atheists interested in religion. No matter how much is true, it just doesn't matter. This book has made the average book reader think, discuss and question so many things in our everyday life and existence.<br />I spent an entire evening plus the following night reading it non-stop.<br />DO NOT see the movie, it sucks!!
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I actually rented it and kept it for a week and kept watching it over and over again and finally realised I had to buy it! I've had it for a couple of weeks now and have probably seen it another dozen times. The actor John Cameron Mitchell who plays Hedwig is AMAZING!!! He wrote the songs, sings the songs, directed the film and came up with the original idea of Hedwig. WOW!!! There is something special about this movie-it's like a drug. The songs are catchy and Mitchell has a beautiful voice. I would describe it as an adult, alternative musical/movie. For me, it's sitting right up there with my  Sound of Music dvd...I love it THAT much!!!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Does a metal group as popular and looked up to like Metallica, have the right to make a few mistakes? ...Yeah. Do they have what it takes to be able to bounce back up? Sure. Do they deserve any praise when they bounce back. Why not? This is exactly what happened when they released this album, Death Magnetic.     The opening track, This Was Just Your Life, begins silently, clean electric coming in about 9 seconds into the song, giving a symbolic feeling how Metallica is creeping back into fan's hearts, (and steroes). This is one of many songs on here where many of the one/two star reviewers find clipping to be \\"unbearable\\". Don't take it too seriously. It's not that bad. Minimally noticable. One of my favorite songs, a true thrash song.    The following track, The End of the Line...another one of my favorites attaches itself nicely afterward. An excellent song to succeed it's predecessor.    The third, Broken Beat and Scarred, is another song subject to the complaints of distortion. This one is a little more noticable. I don't personally find it annoying to the point where I skip this track, but still a good song nonetheless.    Ahh the 1st single off the album, The Day That Never Comes. A style that reminds me, and several others of their first big hit, \\"One\\" about 10 years ago. They have managed to make the song more original than \\"One pt. 2) As probably you have heard on your local radio station or sattelite, song begins mild with a steady beat and drifts into a heavy driven thrash song, much like One. Probably the most noticable of the clipping/distortion, especially during the presence of hard hitting snare drums. I really enjoy hearing this song, though. Kirk's solos are some mean shredding.     The next track, my personal favorite. All Nightmare Long. And the song with the most noticable bass. Any one who states that there are NO audible bass tracks on here, probably listens to their music though earbuds. But anyway, this is probably the darkest song (musically speaking) on here, and it fits. Kirk really kills during this song's solo. This is also probably the most progressive song too as it contains SOME complex compositional structures. More so than the others, save their instrumental. Ending sounds like a borrowed riff off of Enter Sandman. Definately a song worth hearing. LUCK RUNS OUT!!!!!    The next song, Cynide, is a song I'm currently getting into. It originally was the song to skip while rocking out and playing the album in its entirety. I enjoy the chorus. It actually is a little catchy.    This next track is the Unforgiven III, one I was enthusiastic to hear when I first saw Death Magnetic's track listing. The theme, lyrically, seems to fit, but musically or vocally, it doesn't. No keyboards in parts I or II, but still a good song. The ballad of the album, it isn't horrible and plays a factor in not making the album purely thrash.    Next we have, The Judas Kiss. I like this song's lyrics, as they speak about drug addiction. Possibly, at least that's how I interpet them, if I can put my two cents in about the meaning of a song's lyrics.     I was surprised to find this next track is an instrumental. Suicide and Redemption. Metallica's first original isntrumental since To Live is to Die (my favorite Metallica instrumental). Suicide and Redemption is less melodic than other their instrumentals. Kirk adds a nice melodic part around the 4:20 mark. This is also their longest song on the album, clocking in at nearly 10 minutes.     My Apocalypse, the final track is their shortest. Probably the next single. A perfect album closer in comparison to Justice's Dyer's Eve, though not as fast paced.    To those who hate this album claiming Metallica sucked after the loss of Cliff Burton: If a band's music dies in a bus accident, then Metallica is the Jesus of Heavy Metal. I won't get sacreligious.  As for all the clipping and distortion you have been reading about: I won't type in what has aleady been written somewhere onthis Death Magnetic page. Nor will I go on to place blame anywhere. I believe that this was intended to an extent, as providing the album with a raw feeling to it. As if to sound like it came straight from the garage. Why? I don't really know. What I do know is that each of the songs are great. And what I really know is that it is certainly an improvment from..... their previous release some five years ago.    Overall, I would say the theme is very ...And Justice For All. No, this isn't a remake of that excellent 6 star album. (Hell, 10 star) In fact, pretty comparable. In many ways these albums are not the same. Best comparison. Death Magnetic sounds most like.....Death Magnetic. Plenty of thrash, back by some progression add some catchy lyrics yet dealing with dark subjects, suicide, drug addiction, death. Not too progressive, as it is a straightfoward album. Vocally, I hear Black album and some St. Anger. Hey, doesn't mean it sucks, he just has that strong voice.   To avoid any more rambling, I'm just going to end it there. Buy the album! You won't go wrong. Metallica Is Back!!!!    The 300th person to give this a 5-star Review!!!  Stay Metal
B0012IX38K|5.0|Those people that are fans of the books will notice that the movies are dramatically different. However, anyone looking for a stellar action series which each story builds on the next & the action sequences get better & better with every installment won't be dissappointed. Matt Damon brings a new version of this vulnerable yet deadly character to life in a way that makes you want him to win. Its one of my favorite Damon characters.

I think she did a nice job with the character development, so much so that I felt I knew them. I really bummed out when I finished the book because the characters are so real and I felt like I knew them. We have all read about the Nazi's and the horrible things they did, and this book shed's alot of light, for me anyway, on what is was like to have lived through their occupation. I loved this book and I have passed it on to my Aunt to enjoy.

B000001ELF|5.0|I'm being serious about this.  If he isn't better, he's at least just as good by himself.  I feel that without Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley definitely had more creative control with this album.  He probably had just about all of it, and the creative control that he didn't have, he probably offered freely.<br /><br />Back in the late sixties, when Ace Frehley first heard Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced? album, he would carry it wherever he went, under his arm.  If I was alive and around the right age back then, that would be what I'd be doing.  Instead, I just copied the album onto my iPod.<br /><br />As I said, I think that it's much better than the stuff he's done with KISS, as much as I love their stuff.  He does all of the guitar playing on it, a lot of the bass playing on it, and all of the lead vocals.  Anton Fig was also a great help for him.<br /><br />Ace Frehley wrote songs for KISS including the classic \\"Cold Gin,\\" as well as other instant classics such as \\"Parasite,\\" \\"Strange Ways,\\" \\"Getaway;\\" he co-wrote other classics including the instrumental \\"Love Theme From KISS,\\" the unrecognized, but thanks to MTV Unplugged, incredible tune known as \\"Comin' Home,\\" the well-known \\"Rock Bottom,\\" and \\"Flaming Youth.\\"  However, he had only been heard doing lead vocals for two songs, when this album came out; the first one was \\"Shock Me,\\" from the legendary Love Gun album, which I highly recommend, and \\"Rocket Ride,\\" one of the studio tracks from Alive II, which he co-wrote with Sean Delaney.<br /><br />Although that equals up to being exactly an entire KISS-albums worth of songs, Gene Simmons had participating in writing more than half of that amount of songs, and Paul Stanley had participated in writing more than three times that amount; Peter Criss might have not had as much input in songwriting as Frehley had, Peter Criss had done much more lead vocals for KISS, including their biggest selling hit, \\"Beth,\\" which Criss had written.  Where the spaceman had been commonly noticed with KISS was with his guitar solos.<br /><br />The original plan was for KISS to do a movie and to release a big double album, which would probably include the best tracks off of each of these albums performed by KISS, but for obvious reasons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss wanted to do solo albums.  Although a lot of people dislike the other albums, and from the tracks I've heard from them, I can somewhat understand why, especially in comparison to Love Gun, Alive!, and the other KISS albums that had been released at the time.<br /><br />This album has the guitar playing that Ace Frehley was known for, and the singing and songwriting that people were a bit more curious about.  Each song on the album is a real treat to listen to.  I can't really say which song is a highlighting point because they're all highlights.  However, the instrumental \\"Fractured Mirror\\" definitely stands out in that it's softer than the other tracks, and it's an instrumental tune.  \\"New York Groove\\" was the hit single, so when hearing the album, one would expect it to heavily stand out, but I noticed it, having heard it, yet it went perfectly well with the rest of the album.  \\"What's On Your Mind\\" is also great, \\"Rip It Out\\" is another one I love, \\"Ozone,\\" \\"Snowblind,\\" and I really can't single out any specific track and say it was the highlighting point.  This is an actual album.<br /><br />Ace Frehley's guitar playing, his singing, and his compositional work (songwriting) really make this album fantastic.  Paul Stanley himself commented that he really liked Ace doing songs because Ace was really good.  I still don't understand why he didn't do more, if Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley said that they weren't egotistical, they just wanted the best.  They probably were a bit egotistical.<br /><br />I don't like to favor members of bands, but I can't help but favor Ace Frehley over the rest, so I found it a bit weird that my favorite KISS album was Creatures of the Night.  However, the fact that I find this album just as good, if not better than Creatures of the Night makes up for it.  Well, at least I hope it does.better than Creatures of the Night makes up for it.  Well, at least I hope it does.
6305558167|1.0|My husband and I had seen this in the theatre when it was first released.  We remembered it as \\"really good\\"...Well apparently tastes change.  After 17 years (and one Lord of the Rings Trilogy!) this one makes you laugh or cringe-depending on the scene.  The only good part was Sir Percival throwing the sword back to the Lady of the Lake at the end.  Thr rest was a lot of clanking, hoof beats, yelling (was everyone deaf?) and hacking.  Just plain dumb.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Even if you are a faithful viewer of the show, you inevitably miss some part of the episodes during the season.  Either because of a bathroom break or a phone call....and the sad thing is you don't realize it matters all that much.  Well, with a show such as Supernatural it does matter!  I love being able to watch Dean and Sam, uninterrupted, at my leisure.  I own both season 1 and 2 and will be getting 3 asap!
B00007LTIA|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I put the Tales From Topographic Oceans LP on the phonograph. I had by then already owned The Yes Album and Fragile but still I was not prepared for what I was to experience: &#34;Dawn of light lying in between a silence and soul sources...&#34; I was to feel feelings and think thoughts never dreamed of til then. I ran to a friend's house with the album and we (I?) eagerly listened to it as he proceeded to fall asleep! Ah, well, I suppose such a search must be a solitary one, at least mine has been. When you are ready, Tales From Topographic Oceans will change your life.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I love this show, and even though I had every episode on iTunes, I wanted it for the extras.  The extras were not as good as on previous DVD sets of this show, but they were still worth it!  I thought that there was going to be a toy Impala with the set, and was disappointed when it wasn't there.  Maybe if I had waited and purchased it elsewhere....but I still love the show, and amazon is great!

B0013D8LOU|4.0|I am not much into musicals.  Gigi, My Fair Lady, and that is about it.  But the gothic, horror nature drew me to view this movie.  I surprisingly enjoyed it.<br />The one flaw: Tim Burton is tied to the apron strings of Bonham Carter.  Johnny Depp seems to be Burton's illegitimate love child.  It is the only way I can explain the innumberable amount of movies Depp inhabits in the Tim Burton world of film-making.<br />Burton could have had a grade-A achievement on his hands.  It is bloody, (though the blood looks like stage blood--still not for children).  Burton worked closely with Sondheim and thus had a well-established plot to put his pretty pictures with.  A rare one for Burton.  Good on imagery; very poor on plot.<br />Having all this too his advantage, he still managed to muck it up by casting Depp and Carter in the two key roles of the opera/musical.  What a pity.<br />Depp is no opera singer; and Carter is just no singer--plain and simple.  If Burton had only cast Patti Lupone or a younger version of her (if he wanted younger, I'm sure Burton could have found one); and Michael Cerveris would have made an excellently menacingly Sweeney Todd.  Cerveris did the chamber opera version and was exceptional as a singing Sweeney.  He oozed evil.<br />Sondheim could have insisted; but perhaps Sondheim simply wanted the money and gave the casting over to Burton.  I would have said \\"No\\".  sondheim doesn't need the money; and he could have at least put the damp on Depp and Carter.<br />The rest of the cast are very good to excellent.  The two best singers are Tobias and Anthony.  Johanna and the beggar woman were suitably good.<br />But Depp and Carter shall always make this one the big chance of putting Sonheim's gothic opera to film; but ultimately: the one that slipped through Burton's fingers. Even though it was staged and filmed quite well.<br />Burton deserves half the blame for not being able to say no to Carter the whining singer who could shatter glass; and Sondheim the other half for not standing his ground for first rate singers down the line.<br />One day ten years from now, this movie needs to be remade with real singers for the entire cast.  That shall be a five star production.  Include the \\"Ballad of Sweeney\\" and I'd give it 6!<br /><br />Braithwaiteanding his ground for first rate singers down the line.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|If it isn't, it's pretty darn close. Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season. I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction. This is the only great show the CW has ever produced. Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.<br /><br />Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality. If your a horror and action fan like me, you won't find any show on TV better than this. Okay, maybe Dexter, but that's more thriller than horror.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love everything I order from amazon most of the time. Anyway I love this DVD set b/c it shows where the show started in a way where you couldn't see it in the TV show. I loved it truly and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Supernatural the show. And even if you aren't a fan of the show this a great way for you to see what the show is all about trust me you will get hooked!! Always ~~prissy~~
B000WCBPBO|5.0|Just what the heck are you people talking about??? This score is phenomenal! Did you think you bought the soundtrack?    Anyway, this is a great score. I own over 150 movie score's and in the cumputer-animated-movies-genre this is one of my top two at the moment. Ice Age II and this one share 1-st place. They are both dynamic and really fun to listen to.    Actully I had never heard of Rupert Gregson-Williams before I bought this score, but he found a place in my heart for sure. I'm looking forward to his next score whatever it may be.    /Glenn from Sweden
B00127RAJY|2.0|This dvd has three 20 minute workouts with each getting more difficult.  It reminded me of elementary school gym class.  The exercises are hard and it does give a good workout.  It is easy to follow with uncomplicated movements.  I just think it's really boring.  I did it twice.  My daughter is 16 and loves it, so it was not a waste of money. This dvd would be good for people that hate working out and want to spend very little time on exercise.
B000025RX4|5.0|Johnny Winter was signed to Columbia Records in 1968 and for the next decade or so sold a lot of records, beat a harrowing addiction to Heroin, and helped ressurect Muddy Waters' post-Chess career producing the blues giant's superb, final three albums. Sony has remastered Winter's eponymous debut, and issued a 'deluxe' edition of 1969's \\"Second Winter\\" (also issued on gold disc by Mobile Fidelity). \\"...And\\", Winter's third release, from 1970, somehow has fallen through the cracks. Fans already know that after the McCoys ('Hang On Sloopy', among other hits) broke up   Winter hired the group - most importantly guitarist/producer Rick Derringer - to form And. This album is harder rocking, the blues sublimated within a Stones-like soundscape. And Winter's singing shows greater subtlety than previously. Also the material is very consistent. (A live album, \\"Johnny Winter And...Live!\\" from 1971 became Winter's biggest album to date, but to these ears it has dated a bit, relying too much on flash and bombast, despite some dazzling moments). Forget the European edition offered here, which dates from 1993 - the sound is drab and colorless. I'm writing this review to let others know that audiophile label DCC (best known for their exquisite gold discs, remastered by Steve Hoffman) for a brief time had a regular-priced line of silver CDs, and in this case Hoffman beautifully remastered \\"Johnny Winter And\\" for release around the turn of the century. Of course the graphics are reproduced exactly down to the last detail(DCC was always way more faithful to such details than DCC - even devoting two booklet pages to repros of the original vinyl LP's side one/two labels!), but the revelation is in the sound. If you have the BGO edition, or an old vinyl copy, this edition will blow you away with its attention to detail, ambience, and warmth. Guitar parts you never noticed, the feel of a great band in the room, cymbals that 'sing'... In my opinion \\"And\\" and \\"Still Alive and Well\\" (1973)are perhaps Winter's finest albums ever, in terms of quality material, committment, and overall impact, so Winter fans certainly might want to track this one down, unless Sony has plans to reissue their own upgrade soon. Of course it's out of print, but the original (circa 1999-2000) label and serial numbers are: DCC Compact Classics, DZS-194. And good luck!

B000X5SPBI|5.0|What a relief. After seeing some other great shows that teeter off after the first two seasons (Dead Zone, 4400, I'm looking in your direction), Supernatural comes back with great shows, well written, well acted and all having to do with the countdown to Dean's possible demise by the Hell Hounds. No matter where the boys are or what they're doing, suddenly you hear a reference, \\"Dean, we've only got 6 months/2 months/3 weeks/30 hours\\" to break this deal. Sam's efforts to save him, run ins with demons, vampires and a final showdown with Gordon are all great but my pick would have to be Jus in Bello, a great siege episode against an army of demons. The creativity of how to deal with possessed people attacking in hordes is amusing as well quite well thought out. Holy water from toilets, man. Nuff said! The finale is also unbelievably good so check it out.   16 episodes meant a more trim season rather than a patchwork of shoddy episodes that were the staple of television during this Writer's Strike season. I even liked the Ghostfacers episode although I loathed the first one in a previous season. The Christmas episode is much better than I expected with a title like \\"A very Supernatural Christmas\\" It makes references to the borhters childhood as in the Striga episode of the first season using the same actors. The kid Dean is a pretty decent actor. I hope to see more of him in flashbacks for the next season.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I can't say enough good thing about the actual content of this set.  The series is fantastic, and unfortunately way too short.  (Thanks a lot FOX).  The only reason this isn't a five star review is because the production values on the dvds themselves are really terrible.  The menus are simpler than something a three year old can make with iDVD, and the cases are like the cheap ones they put the discs in for the dollar DVD bargain bin at most discount stores.  I hope the upcoming bluray release gets more attention.

B000PMFTDQ|5.0|If I had to chose to bring two albums and obligated to discard of all the rest this is one of the recordings I would chose. These Lieder have been recorded by the best of the very best, ranging from Schwarzkopf to Ludwig, and, yet, none of them live up to Ms Norman's standard on this blessed album. Strauss was infatuated with Schwarzkopf but would have fallen in love head over heals had he ever had the oppurtunity to listen to Ms Norman.<br /><br />First of all, let it be emphazied, the Leipziger Orchestra is outstanding. Ms Norman simply rests in one of the best musical renditions of Strauss' Lieder ever. The forceful Norman holds back and sings in a perfect German with a delicacy that gives credibility to every word of the lovely lyrics. She's not trying to sound German. She is German with an indepth understanding of Strauss and his ailments. She does him honor.<br /><br />Ms Norman sings in a restrained, refined voice, freed from all traces of affectation and bravura, and the result is simply breathtaking.<br /><br />Due to actual events and the austere Preussian tradition, everything German, including the langage, has been rejected globally for it's sternness and ugliness. This, however, is not true. German poetry, music and the language are actually very lyrical and rich and ms Norman lives up to every expectation.<br /><br />Not being a German myself and previously somewhat reluctant to listen to most repertoire in the language, Ms Norman helped me cross the barrier and open up a whole world of wondrous things which she is able to transcend to a degree where one has to capitulate ( Strauss, Bach and Schubert Lieder).<br /><br />Norman is great at languages. Her French is impeccable. But I believe her German is even better. This album contains some of her best work ever, as in the case of the Leipziger Orchestra. Simply outstanding ! Douglas Modig<br /><br />This is art at it's peak.
B000K7VHH8|4.0|I like Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, she looked great in this film before having kids. This is a nerve-racking game of cat and mouse game with a great cast of supporting actors. I read the Blu-Ray reviews and once Amzon had a good sale I picked in up for less than I paid for the DVD. The picture quality is very good and sound isn't bad either.  It a nice film, good action, and they don't have to blow everything in the world up to may it interesting. If you liked the movie, find a sale on Amazon and add it to you Blu-Ray collection. It will not be a master blu-ray to show off to your friends, but it's of better quality that a lot of other releases.
B001E95ZNI|5.0|While coming slow, westerns seem to be coming back. This one is not the best I have seen but I could easily put it in the top 20 of the westerns I have seen. I am 58 and have seen every western ever made. Well every one worth watching.<br />You don't need to know the plot. (It's not about a horse). Appaloosa is the name of the town. It's the usual evil against good. If you like westerns it's a must see.<br />The acting is top notch. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen do exceptional work. Better than average. All characters were good in the film. Many unknown to me.<br />The cinematography was outstanding. About as good as the recent 3:10 to Yuma film. It gave a very authenticity to the time. The camera angles and lighting to create good contrast were well done. Time of day created good mood such as dusk and early morning scenes. Windy and dusty was the flavor of the town at times. Dirty and dusty clothes create realism. Part of the film is done on a train. Excellent sound from the steam engine. There are some wonderful camera angles during this part. The train is authentic. Not some european high pitched whistle train. From the train scene they lose their prisoner and must track him on horseback. Excellent scenery and mighty fine horses.<br />There is some humor in this film which adds to the enjoyment. Of course there is a woman or two to add to the plot. A little bit of everything.<br />Some nice weapons thrown in for the enjoyment.<br />I enjoyed it very much. It was a good one to see in the theatre.
B001CTA1T8|5.0|Being the chihuahua lover that I am, I was first in line at our local cinema to see this flick!    I loved it from begining to end, however it wanst exactly what I expected.  From some of the previews it looked like there would be lots more chihuahuas in most of the film, but for the most part it is two chis (Chole and Papi) along with a German Shepard.  Towards the end is about 5-7 mintues of films with LOTS of chihuahuas, include a bit of history about the breed, some pretty cool looking aztec ruins, and chis of every shape and color, including brindles, blue, chocolates, blacks, merles, spotted, fawn and even long coats!      Has great themes about finding your roots, not giving up on your true friends and helping others when they need it the most.  Also, that no matter what your situtation is, there is a place where you belong.    I went with a friend from work (we are both adults) and we both loved it.  We laughed and cried, and agreed we will see it again and buy it when it comes to video!    Also, kudos to Disney.  At the end of this film there is a note about how each  pets deserves a permenant loving home, and if you purchase a dog, to do research on the breed!
0307269752|4.0|As I was reading this book I couldn't help thinking that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a bit of a misleading title.  While Salander, the girl with the titular tattoo, is arguably the second most prominent character in the book and necessary as the person who through her investigative skills and computer hacking uncovers many of the clues needed to solve the two mysteries laid out in the book, the title suggests a seedy, underworld crime and a mysterious heroine.  Salander is neither, although she is quite an interesting character, and it's nice that the author doesn't judge her anti-social tendencies and problems, preferring to offer us a glimpse into their possible causes.  The protagonist is actually Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who has just been convicted of libel for his reporting of financial wrongdoing by a titan of Swedish industry.  Before he has time to report for his prison sentence, he is hired by an another titan of Swedish industry, Henrik Vanger, an aging man whose company has fallen into disarray, to look into the disappearance of his niece nearly 40 years previously, under the guise of shadow writing an autobiography about the Vanger clan.<br /><br />The real star character in the book is the Vanger family itself, the whole, confusing, squabbling cast of near and distant cousins, fascists, Nazis, haridans and seemingly ordinary folk, and their relationship with each other, especially as it unfolds as Blomkvist digs into the family's past.  The main mystery of the book -- what happened to Harriet Vanger one fateful day in 1966 -- ends up being pretty easy to figure out, but the ins and outs and the hows and whys aren't so straightforward and it's a joy for most of the book trying to keep the various family members straight (although a family tree would have been nice) and watching how the unfolding drama affects them.<br /><br />Where the book falls down just slightly, in my opinion, is its heavy handed treatment of some of the subjects in the book, important though they are.  A few reviewers have noted that the Swedish title of this book was Men Who Hate Women, and had I known that, perhaps I wouldn't have been bothered by the sheer number of men in the book who do just that, most in pretty horrid and aggressive ways.  I suspect that part of the problem I had with this book is just a matter of cultural translation -- the book takes place in Sweden and was written by a Swedish author who was both a journalist and a crusader against right-wing extremists in Sweden.  While he also uses the book to rail against the ineptitude of financial reporting in Sweden, the Nazi and fascist parties in Sweden, extremist religions, financial malfeasance, journalistic ethics, the failure of Sweden's approach to institutionalized care of juveniles, and other causes clearly near and dear to him before he died, his big one is violence against women and he cites lots of statistics about the number of women who are victims of sexual assault.  Heck, one of the books that Blomkvist reads for pleasure is Val McDermid's The Mermaids Singing, a crime mystery based around violence against women.  But Larsson overplays his case just a bit by having too many men who are absolute creeps (not just jerks), and the last one is totally gratuitous.  The point could have been made better with a slightly subtler hand.  Oddly (to my American sensibilities, anyway, but maybe this is another problem in cultural translation), the book is full of men and women who don't seem to mind their spouses/lovers having other lovers at the same time.  It's a kitchen sink of Swedish liberalism that sometimes gets in the way of what is for the most part a rollicking good read with interesting characters and settings.<br /><br />The writing is mostly very good, with some overly staccato dialogue that doesn't sound natural, but again, this may be an issue of how speech sounds in Sweden since it seems that the translation has been quite well done.<br /><br />Ofthe two mysteries, the main one, about Harriet's disappearance, is the more compelling.  The other, involving financial crimes is interesting at a very intellectual level, but Larsson resolves the ethical issues a bit too easily.<br /><br />Larsson keeps the characters true to themselves rather than offering a completely tidy and happy ending for all, but the main issues are resolved and I ended it feeling satisfied.  It's an excellent, if slightly flawed, first novel, and I will read the sequels if they are ever translated into English., about Harriet's disappearance, is the more compelling.

Well, unlike most of the reviewers, I just got this 2 weeks ago, and I haven't stopped listening to it. Matter of fact, I just started a minute ago. People in general should have this, Piper, Saucerful, AHM, Dark Side, WYWH, Animals and the Wall in their collection. You don't come across albums this good anymore, I mean anything post 1999 needs a couple of listens, except Maiden and Priest that is. I love the spaced out feeling of Pillow in the Wind and Fearless. Great writing musically and lyrically. Not one bad tune, even Seamus is good. Yes, I like Seamus and I don't care what everyone else says, it's still a good listen.<br />  Then we get to the song that defines this album, and eventually Pink Floyd's future. \\"Echoes\\" the 23 and a half minute masterpiece that wore out the other side of the Vinyl LP. Honestly, how many people have bought this physically or electronically(iTunes) just for Echoes. It's a shame the greatest hits is missing 7 minutes. I think you need the entire song to truly appreciate it. Well, check it out here, or on iTunes, but buy it physically, because you'll like it so much, that you can't live without it. That and what happens if you forget to back everything up, and the computer crashes, now you're screwed. So do yourself a favor, and get it today. Without Meddle, we don't have Dark Side of the Moon. Hell, get both of them at once.
B00005CDNK|4.0|I think Abba is so underrated, because their harmonies are so absolutely beautiful. This CD has several songs on it that are worth buying to keep...\\"The Visitors\\" is a song that is just fun to hear. But others, like \\"One of Us\\" and \\"Like an Angel Passing thru my Room\\" are those stop still songs that make you pause and remember. A song that can be sad \\"Slipping through My Fingers\\" is so gorgeous and so relatable to anyone seeing their child growing up, and it was just featured in the \\"Mamma Mia\\" film. Note the beauty of the front cover of the CD...the rich golden color and the way the members are standing apart, with the ceilings high around them. It is worth a buy because it's not all about one good song. Let's get back to worthwhile, classy music.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|Having not read the graphic novel on which this movie is based, I cannot (and would not) debate the faithfulness of the adaptation or its relative worth.  I also cannot divine what the Wachowski brothers' intent or motivations might have been, especially regarding the current political climate.  I can only relate what I witnessed and experienced from the film alone as an isolated piece of art, and it was good... profoundly so.    The film does not dabble with subtleties or nuances.  The regime in charge of Britain is clearly oppressive.  However they came to power and whatever their motivations (and the film ultimately reveals the back story), it is clear that they rejoice in their complete authority and enthusiastically abuse it.  The field agents or Fingermen violate the citizenry; the televised face of the nation self-righteously revels in the judgment heaped upon other nations spewing smug vitriol; the religious leaders fulfill their carnal desires; the communications ministry controls all programming twisting the news to its own ends while eavesdropping on the general population; the Chancellor clearly rules through fear and with an iron fist.  Dissidents are quickly and quietly disposed of through violent means.  Free thought does not exist.  This is an archetypal oppressive evil regime.    V is the faceless archetypal hero.  Happily he remains faceless for the duration of the movie.  His mask is all we see.  The lifeless mask allows for his thoughts and ideas to be the focus rather than his individuality.  His appeal is not so much for how he handles a fight and a blade, though impressive; his true weapon is speech.  Eloquent and literate, he expresses ideas that cut straight to the heart (the people should not fear their government, but the government should fear its people).  Suspend belief for a period and watch as he shakes a sleeping nation.  He chastises the citizens as the true culprits that have allowed the current state of affairs.  Then he providesinspiration and a means  to do something about it.  We see the cowardly and zombie-like nation slowly awaken and climactically throw off its oppressor.    This is not a \\"how-to\\" tool for overthrowing a dictatorship.  Nor is it in my opinion a scathing indictment of any administration or specific political landscape in the first decade of the 21st century (though it will make you think about some things).  Its power is in the universality of the tale.  It resonates because it does not have to be political at all.  It is about people and oppression and anyone finally standing up to throw off tyranny in any of its forms by whatever means.  Certainly violence works well for a movie and to dramatically represent the point.  But do not lock the greater meaning and power of the message into its form.  Speaking of its universality, I was very much reminded of the musical \\"Les Miserables\\" (precursor to the French Revolution).  It is a rousing tale where one sacrifices self-interest for the greater good.    The cinematography is phenomenal with its stark colorization; it is a visually stunning film.  The action is entertaining.  A more rousing tune than the \\"1812 Overture\\" cannot be found.  The film slows slightly while providing some back story, but it is necessary to fully inform the narrative.  From start to finish, it is just a remarkable achievement.
0061547832|4.0|This is an entertaining read.  Trump stays true to his style. It's honest and venomous and motivating.  He's quite prepared to name 'em and shame 'em. Much better than the feeble \\"Why We Want You to be Rich\\" which he co-wrote with Robert Kyosaki.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Bought it for my mother in law and she loves every bit of it. Great music and good quality sound. Great gift. Promptly delivered
B000YDOOU0|4.0|Buy this one now. We'll all be enjoying it for years to come. I find the drummer especially good, as well.
B001DESMMU|3.0|Hmmm.... Daron! Solo Album??!!  Serj! Solo Album??!! I'd go with Serj!<br />SOB is musically half of SOAD, the other half being ETD. I'm sure we've heard both Daron & Serj's solo efforts, I can easily listen to any SOAD album & tell the difference between Serj & Daron's song writing! But then again, I'm not writing a compare & contrast review here, This review is about the Scars on Broadway cd / dvd. Well, Musically this album is great, Expected of Daron, but lyrically, I dont understand the message Daron is trying to get thru with this album, or if there is any message at all??!?!? I know its supposed to be all anti politics & all, but at times the un necessary rambling on of f's & b's gets annoying! I mean seriously, come eat some chemicals with me? say f**k the world?? p*ss on ur face while you suck on my c**k?? the song structures arent as layered & complex as the SOAD albums, very standard Punk / Hard rock here. Best track would be \\"They Say\\" Duhhhh!!  But all in all, a good effort, atleast now we know how far both apples fell from the tree, heh! The dvd aint all that great, it would be if there was live footage, you get just the video & making of \\"They Say\\" I got it used though, for a reasonable price! But listen to the cd for yourself, you'll know the difference between ETD & SOB that I'm rambling on about!
B0019VTKIM|5.0|At Last \\"El Cid\\" comes to the world in a perfect edition.The movie is one of the most great icons of an \\"epic movie\\", probably the best with \\"Spartacus\\", \\"Ben Hur\\" and some others. Great extras, great image and quality. Superb edition
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I love it and play it frquently in my car to work. Someone said he is the new Frank Sinatra. My mother in law agrees. Did not know he sang the song \\"Everything\\". It is played on the radio everyday. Good quality music..
0684857219|5.0|The most thorough book I've seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger did a remarkable job covering any aspect of bodybuilding. From the different exercises, programs and nutrition to the most subtle topics. I read a few other books and this book is definitely the best one I read so far - VERY RECOMMENDED!
1582701709|5.0|In the world we live in to today , i think it is essential to have a belief system. It doesn't matter what it is, a higher power, the beauty of nature, or a BOOK! I think that if more people believed in the positive, that things would change in the universe. I think that the message should be clear, that everyone has a right to have a source of positivity in their lives. Why anyone would \\"burst someones bubble\\" is beyond me. Everyone has positive and negatives in their lives and I do believe that anyone can have it all, if they beleive they deserve it!  Creating a book \\"The Secret\\" is a small step to teach people that there is good and great things to be had. So much negativity surrounds this book, from negative and ultimately unhappy people.  Yes, I have read \\"The Secret\\" many times and each and everytime I get some source and sense of serenity, how can that be a bad thing. So in keeping with perspective, that \\"everything does happpen for a reason\\" can you beleive that people attract into their lives what they want? You are in CONTROL of your destiny, You do posses the power to attain! Some of it takes work and some of it is just the flow of the Universe.  People be happy and kind to one another, that's the first step!
B001C08RHA|5.0|Well, I guess I'm going to jump on the `Iron Man' bandwagon and admit that I loved the film from beginning to end. Michael Downey Jr. delivers a masterful performance in the role of Tony Stark, former weapons prodigy and multi-millionaire playboy who sees the error of his way and decides to do all he can to undo the damage wrought upon the world by his destructive creations. His call to action takes the former of Iron Man, a metal clad crusader who's all but impervious to conventional weaponry, has the ability to fly at supersonic speeds and comes equipped with the best technology of the day to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. I also enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-time executive assistant and future love interest. The chemistry between the two was palpable and believable.<br /><br />Yes, `Iron Man' receives high marks across the board; strong storyline, wonderful performances, crisp and witty dialogue along with a heart-pounding soundtrack that will leave you anxiously awaiting the sequel. A number of previous reviews have made the statement that the special effects don't live up to expectations. I'm not an effects expert, but it sure looked awfully spectacular to me! My Rating: -5 Stars-.
B00005MP58|5.0|The title of the book and the film never seemed to appeal to me. When Amazon had this as a Gold Box Deal I thought 1,500 reviews couldn't be wrong.<br /><br />WOW, I love it. Mr. Darcy such a character. You cannot stand his attitude when you first meet him but you love his looks. I knew Miss Elizabeth loved and hated him right from the the start. Being a romantic at heart the looks they exchange.....hmmmm young love.<br /><br />If you have never seen it, this is a very nice edition. The film is beautiful in sight and feelings. The costumes are so finely done. I highly recommend this edition.<br /><br />I will note that with an HDTV and upconverting DVD player it is very nearly in HD, considering it was made in 1996 I consider this a very high quality set.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|i bought this movie because i thought it might be good but when i watched it it was way way better then i thought it would be. i cried and cried watching this movie and for a guy that is pretty unusual.for all you people out there never go by other reviewers. you have to see it for yourself. thank you.
0307120007|3.0|My son does love this book...especially the peek-a-boo page.  However, I don't know why it's not constructed better.  This book was about $10, and the pages are a thick paper instead of board book material.  Since this book is geared towards the little ones, they really should make this into a board book.  How much more expensive can that be?  There are other touch and feel books that are board books that sell for $5 or $6.
0143038419|4.0|There are several themes to this book beyond the three segments. Supposedly it was a woman's search for love, which she seems to have found to some tolerable degree.  Personally, I did not connect to her emotional flailing,nor did I find much wisdom or solace in various types of pizza, and often felt that I could get a better description of Italy from a travel folder, and nearly put the book aside. And yet, I kept on reading and reading and finally got to India, which was Very interesting. I learned a great deal about that foreign and yet comforting religious way of life. If for nothing else, the India section of the book was worth it all.   The Indonesian segment was easy and light to read.  I'm not sure whether the author came out more likable or not,but she seemed to feel that she was, so...  If the reader was supposed to learn how to get in touch with God through her examples, I hope that those who didn't know how to do so before reading this book, benefitted from it.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|THE BAND: James Hetfield (vocals, guitars), Kirk Hammett (guitars), Lars Urlich (drums & percussion), Robert Trujillo (bass).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2008) 10 tracks clocking in at just under 75 minutes. Included with the disc is a 20-page booklet containing song titles, song lyrics, and one band photo. Recorded at Sound City Studios (Van Nuys, CA), Shangri La Studios (Malibu, CA) and HQ (San Rafael, CA). This is the band's 9th studio album. All music by Metallica, all lyrics written by Hetfield. Label - Warner Bros Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Producer Bob Rock had a good run with Metallica (even though the band went a bit too far mainstream). However, his last album with the band, &#34;St.Anger&#34; (2003) sealed his own fate. In my opinion, &#34;St.Anger&#34; was a complete disaster on so many levels. So another painstaking five years between albums, and in comes master controller Rick Rubin (producing for bands such as System Of A Down, Rage Against The Machine, Danzig, The Cult, Run-DMC, Tom Petty, Audioslave, etc). Back to basics some will say... and I for the most part agree with them. While I do hear a chord here and there that sounds like &#34;St.Anger&#34; might resurface, most of what I hear reminds of the &#34;And Justice For All...&#34; (1988) era. Where &#34;Load&#34; (1996) and their self titled &#34;Black&#34; (1991) albums concentrated on melody, I really feel &#34;Death Magnetic&#34; is for the most part a throw back to their intensely sharp riffs that have since been locked away for the past two decades. The sound of the album is rich, but like so many cd's today, the levels are pushed to the brink. You might not notice it at low volume, but turn the dial to 11 and most listeners might agree - you're in for a somewhat distorted listen.<br /><br />As for the album, it debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top 200 (staying there for 3 weeks). The title is a tribute to our fallen heroes in the music business (i.e. Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Layne Staley, etc)... being drawn to death like a magnet, or conversely pushed away. The first (and biggest) hit to surface is/was &#34;The Day That Never Comes&#34;. To date, smaller hits have surfaced in &#34;Cyanide&#34;, &#34;The Judas Kiss&#34;, &#34;My Apocalypse&#34;, and &#34;Unforgiven III&#34;. I had to give this disc dozens of spins before I could write (unlike the 100+ posts that appeared here on Amazon hours after it's release on 9/12/08).<br /><br />The lyrics might be the biggest drawback here - nothing fresh, nothing thought provoking - the lyrics concentrate on the familiar bleak Metallica subjects - death by suicide, annihilating the enemy, corroded innocence, blood spilling war stories, woeful amputees, emotional disconnection, suffering in various other forms... leaving the listener with that &#34;we're all gonna die&#34; feeling in general. You'll find the album title tucked neatly within the last track &#34;My Apocalypse&#34;. As for the feel of the album, it gets better as it progresses through the tracks. While I don't think there's a bad track to be found here, some songs are obviously better than others. I feel the weakest tracks are the opener &#34;That Was Just Your Life&#34; (nice intro, but a mess of a rhythm section) and &#34;Broken, Beat And Scarred&#34; (worst lyrics of any song here). The single &#34;The Day That Never Comes&#34; is a good song, but it's easily the softest of the bunch (this might be the lone song from the album that you can play at a dinner party that probably won't offend anyone). If this were vinyl, side-B is easily better than side-A. &#34;Cyanide&#34; was the first song that jumped out at me... and after so many spins, it's still my favorite tune of the bunch. Good melody, decent lyrics, tight rhythm guitars, mostly fast with a slow section thrown in, and overall sung well with a few trademark Hetfield growls.&#34; The Judas Kiss&#34; is a heavy song with a shredding guitar solo. &#34;Suicide & Redemption&#34; (the band's firstinstrumental since the 80's) is a monstrous near 10-minute jam. And believe it or not, &#34;Unforgiven III&#34; is a great song (with it's slow chugging rhythm section), but I truly think the band has beaten the proverbial dead horse with the 3rd installment of the same song name.<br /><br />The album cover and liner notes are a cool concept from a distance, but personally I'd rather have all of the lyrics (a fraction of the lyrics are missing due to being cut out of the middle &#34;coffin&#34; shape). Wishful thinking (?) - hopefully Metallica will give the fans another album of this caliber without the 5 year wait - I refuse to hold my breath until 2013. Overall - certainly not a classic (those that compare this to the '86 masterpiece &#34;Master Of  Puppets&#34; simply haven't given either disc enough listening time), but a nice comeback indeed. A good album from a legendary heavy metal band (4 stars).ous near 10-minute jam.

B000067J1H|4.0|Fight Club was one those films which fall into the category of \\"loved it or hated it \\"  I stand with the former loved it  The premise of the film is to fight back  Psychological and physical violence both leave scars   Both will heal over time, but the mental scars go deeper  Fight Club gives people the chance to come face to face with the antagonist, be it a stranger or someone you have known all of your life  Stranger's sometimes have more control over your life than you do  Fight Club has a nice plot twist and is always throwing in new little subplots' to keep you on your toes  Edward Norton is excellent as the narrator and one of the best actors to emerge over the last 15 years  Brad Pitt turns in a great performance as Tyler Durden the \\"partner\\" of Norton  Meatloaf also turns in great performance as Bob, whose mental scars are almost as large as his physical ones  Helena Bonham Carter is worth seeing as Marla Singer the woman who feels left out and realizes that a woman isn't the only one who can feel downtrodden and abused
0743289692|5.0|Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali was a great read. I was overwhelmed by her courage in moving out of a culture she had grown up in because it stifled her sense of self as a women and as an intellectual person who couldn't bear the restraints that her culture had put on her. To give up family and home and be any alien who had to get a whole new life together and then to shine in her choice, makes it a must read for any woman in that kind of situation. I was so impressed I want to read more of her works.

I ordered this expecting just the cd in a normal case, but what i got was a nice digipak style package with a bonus dvd of live shows, which is full of songs from the older albums all the way up to their most recent With oden on our side. Its an excellent addition and very generous that they would give it included for free. With a case design and cover art this cool, this is sure to be one of those cds you want to own, NOT DOWNLOAD.
0375826726|5.0|I loved it.About half way through, though i started to get worried because i saw how impossible it would be for him to end it well in this book. i was thrilled to hear that there was a 4th one coming. I just wasn't ready for it to end. Christopher Paolini is an excellent writer. His word usage sentence structure and phrasiology add to the fact that it's a well concieved story. I also was thrilled with the additional perspectives used. All in all, it was an enthralling read. Can't wait for number 4!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|It doesn't seem so long ago that I was a young lad in the 80's listening to Metallica cassettes and hiding them from my overbearing religious parents. This is \\"the\\" band that introduced me to thrash metal, and over the years I've had the feeling that my childhood amazement was being smashed upon the rocks by every new album they came out with starting with Load. St. Anger came and went, and my face found it's way to the palm of my hand as I shook my head in embarrassment.<br /><br />Enter 2008, with Death Magnetic. I almost didn't pick this album up, because lets face it, most Metallica fans were burned by their last effort and probably didn't feel like paying the guys any attention anymore. I heard the single  \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" and was found feeling awkward...the song wasn't great, but not nearly as bad as I thought. With that tiny ember of hope burning inside me that maybe Metallica could do better, I picked the album up; I am very glad I did.<br /><br />Songs like \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" and \\"All Nightmare Long\\" hearken back to the days of ...And Justice For All. \\"Suicide And Redemption\\" is finally a new instrumental epic with great performances from the entire band. While this album is not perfect, it is a real honest effort to get back to the sound that fans adored. What excites me most about this album is not how great it is (because it certainly is good), but where they will go from here. My faith in the band has been restored significantly, and I now find myself feeling like this was just a re-awakening, and that the next album we'll get an even bigger disc; but that's just my wishful thinking.<br /><br />If you heard and liked \\"The Day That Never Comes\\", then buy this album because the rest of the songs completely blow it out of the water. If you didn't like that single, try listening to some of the other songs using YouTube or some other internet source and see if they do it for you. Overall, this is a great album that I would give a 3.5, but round up to a 4 out of 5 for good measure.<br /><br />I never thought I would utter these words after the release of Load, Reload, and St. Anger but: Metallica, you have made this fan eat his words.or good measure.

B0019T9FL6|4.0|Let me first make it clear that Jennifer Hudson's first album, JENNIFER HUDSON isn't perfect - it is flawed.  However, despite its flaws, I still think it is an enjoyable enough affair and Hudson shows her vocal skills and prowess, even when the material falls short.  The biggest issues with JENNIFER HUDSON as a whole is that it is at times \\"over the top\\", much like Hudson was originally on American Idol, Season 3.  Before \\"The Circle of Life\\" performance that made her the \\"highest vote getter\\" of the night, many of Hudson's performance were \\"manic\\" as Simon would say.  Here is the same deal, but not so much because of Hudson's vocals.  Hudson is a powerhouse, and that is well represented on JENNIFER HUDSON.  Sure, she may do one too many runs or overextend her range one too many times, but it is more the material than Hudson this time around.  For example, while the T-Pain duet \\"What's Wrong (Go Away)\\"  is enjoyable, T-Pain's use of the infamous \\"auto-tune\\" effect is overused; had T-Pain sang without it, the duet would've been much better.  Again, I have to give Hudson high marks here, for vocals alone.  There is nothing just horrible here as some would say, even when things fall the slightest bit short of great.<br /><br />The album opens with my second-favorite song of Jennifer's self-titled debut, \\"Spotlight\\", which is a fine opener.  I'll admit, sometimes I've grown weary of Stargate's production, but they hit yet another high mark on this exceptional single.  Sure, it may not end up being a mega pop hit, but it is doing relatively well at radio.  Again, Shaffer \\"Ne-Yo\\" Smith writes another strong song and Hudson sounds like a true R&B diva here.  \\"If This Isn't Love\\" doesn't compare as highly, though it is solid by all means and Hudson still sounds refined in my eyes.  On the Timbaland produced \\"Pocketbook\\", I'm on the fence.  Overall, I think it is incredibly corny and stupid, yet still, I'll even admit I've spinned it more than once.  I will say this, \\"Timbo\\" has done better and maybe this shows some of his influential production-work slackening a bit or even waning slightly.  Ludacris is fine, though I don't think anybody will rate any rapper's verse in such a corny song where Hudson sings coyly \\"don't let me have to hit you with my pocketbook\\" as high or \\"the second coming\\".  The Robin Thicke penned and produced \\"Giving Myself\\" returns Jennifer to what she pulls off the best, adult-contemporary R&B that works well with grown-folks and those who yearn for \\"old-school\\" powerhouse R&B as opposed to hip-hop influenced soul.  It is exceptional in my mind.<br /><br />Follow-up track, T-Pain featured/produced \\"What's Wrong (Go Away)\\" is good I think, yet I'll be the first to criticize the overproduction via that damn \\"auto-tune\\" that T-Pain rarely seems to retire.  Hudson sounds good and shows her range, though I think her vocals are the slightest bit \\"manic\\" here.  Still, it is very enjoyable and I constantly put this record on repeat.  \\"My Heart\\" (I think produced by Polow Da Don) is average, while Diane Warren penned \\"You Pulled Me Through\\" is much more sound.  My favorite track is none other than the Fantasia featured,  Missy Elliott/Jazmine Sullivan penned \\"I'm His Only Woman\\".  The chemistry of the vocals between these two standout divas is perfect.  In my opinion, Fantasia enhances any song that she's on.  \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" is a Grammy deserving moment on JENNIFER HUDSON.  \\"We Gon' Fight\\" not bad, though not a favorite. \\"Invisible\\" is average, while  \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" is of course an appreciated reprise appearance on JH.  Closing track \\"Jesus Promise Me...\\" won't appeal to some, but I thought it was very well sung, if the slightest bit \\"draggy\\".<br /><br />Overall, JENNIFER HUDSON serves its purpose to showcase the \\"Dreamgirl's\\" pipes.  At times, there are slight misses, though nothing that will ruin Hudson's promising career or star status.  I think her second album will be even better than herfirst.  3.5 stars.stars.
B001CLG6RC|2.0|Lets be honest, Enigma used to be something to move to.  You guys know.  That was a factor in you owning the first one.  MCMXC to The Screen Behind the Mirror were good; I even bought both LSD's.  But you knew back at E2 that things could go south quick by Cretu cranking out those kooky lyrics.  I remember hearing that \\"man is the dream of the dauphin\\" and thinking \\"strange, I had no idea anyone knew what dauphins dreamed about,\\" but hey, I was working and ignored it.  Nothing quite like moving to the beat and then hearing about the American Indians being destroyed by \\"The Cross of Changes\\" to help move ya.    But 14 years later, he's been unchecked and now its way too weird.  Seriously, do you want to be doing your thing and then all of a sudden hear \\"we all have the same parents.\\"  That's the kind of weird that would have never gotten people to buy Enigma 2, much less MCMXC.    So no, I don't expect another MCMXC or even \\"Le Roi ...\\" (we could't be so lucky) but come on.  Just compile great music and mix's and muzzle the weird religious/anti-religious stuff.  I just want to move to the music.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Suspiria is one of the horror classics that seems to divide horror fans; some cite Suspiria as a masterpiece of the genre and one of the greatest horror movies ever made, while others see it as boring and nowhere near the hype it has gotten. And at first I was one of those who would state it as boring and over hyped. Upon my first viewing I was like this is the classic Argento movie people hail as one of the greats? At the time I wasn't really into Argento. While I didn't dislike him I can't say I was a fan.<br /><br />But than I went back and gave his films another chance and suddenly found myself loving these movies I originally thought were about average. So I figured might as well give Suspiria another chance; and watching it the 2nd time I hoped my opinion would change, but I still expected the absolute worst. But my 2nd viewing I just fell in love with this movie and now I'm one of those people who praise it as a masterpiece of the horror genre.<br /><br />Dario Argento has a very strong visual style and more often than not the plot takes a backseat to his visual style and I understood that going into this film and all his others. But for some reason I just couldn't get into his work where as now you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger fan of Argento than me. I would recommend to anyone out there who didn't like Suspiria to give it another chance. If you still dislike it than maybe it's just not for you, but I know besides myself a lot of people disliked Suspiria at first and now love the movie. Suspiria really is one of those movies that gets better and better on multiple viewings.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi and if you were to find any flaws with Suspiria this would be it. While not badly written at all the script is the only weak point of the film. I always mention in my reviews for Argento movies that he at times can be a good writer. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red had very solid scripts and even though I thought The Cat o' Nine Tails was about average the script wasn't bad. The only problem though is in my opinion Argento has never written a really iconic character even in his better scripts. Around the time of Suspiria is when the writing took a backseat to his visual style and use of colors.<br /><br />The script wasn't bad, but just suffers from weak characters; while I wouldn't say the characters are bad or anything they do lack of depth and aren't fully developed, but oddly enough I'd rate Suzy Bannion played by Jessica Harper as one of Argento's better characters despite any lack of depth. The script does mostly work, but this is the kind of movie that without the right director would be a boring disaster of a flick. Sometimes you have movies that while aren't poorly written or anything like that, but could be very boring.<br /><br />As director Dario Argento crafts a masterpiece of a film; the opening act is downright chilling and after that Suspiria does slightly slow down, but Argento's visual style keeps Suspiria creepy and interesting even if it's a bit slow. The use of colors in this movie is just simply amazing. Suspiria just might be the best looking movie I have ever seen, but you can actually make a case for several Argento movies, but Suspiria just might be the best. The look of Suspiria is very much like a nightmare and that is something most Argento movies have going for it. It's also like this twisted fairy tale and all these elements are what elevate Suspiria to a classic of the genre. The best way to describe Suspiria is it's like a nightmare that may not make a whole lot of sense, but is quite chilling.<br /><br />There is so much that goes into directing besides simply storytelling. Granted that is the most important aspect, but there is more to it than that. Dario Argento may not be the best storyteller in the case that his flicks sometimes have a weak plot and maybe characters that lack a little depth, but what he might lack in that area he more than makes up for with suspense, tension and plenty of scares. And again I go back to Dario's visual style, which is what makes him stand out so much and again that is what makes Suspiria so brilliant. As I stated before the opening act is downright chilling and while the movie might slightly slow down it never loses the eerie feeling. The visual aspect and use of colors are the most amazing I have ever seen. Again Suspiria is simply a beautiful movie to look at.<br /><br />Another thing Suspiria has going for it is the score by Goblin; these guys are just amazing and have worked with Argento several times and Claudio Simonetti of Goblin has worked with Argento on almost all his movies and he's probably my favorite composer of all time. The score by Goblin is just mind-blowing and their score adds so much to the movie and makes it downright chilling! It's really hard to say, which score by Goblin is their best these guys have done such great work with Argento and with other filmmakers as well, but in the case of Suspiria, well this could easily be rated as their best score.<br /><br />As I stated earlier in my review if you've seen Suspiria and didn't like it give it another chance and if your opinion doesn't change than the movie just isn't for you. But Suspiria is a movie that might take a couple of viewings; many fans of this movie disliked it at first and like I said I was one of those people as well. Forget the plot and all that and watch Suspiria for its visuals and you might just start to like it.<br /><br />Suspiria in my opinion is a classic horror flick and deserves all the hype it gets. Many hail this as Dario Argento's best flick and while I understand why I'm not sure I would rate this as my favorite by him, but no doubt it's in my top 5 and in my top 20 favorite horror flicks of all time. For those new to Dario Argento I would recommend you check out his work in order; this way you can see how he evolved as a filmmaker. Suspiria is a movie you'll love or hate, but I urge people who disliked this to give it another chance and if you still dislike it that's fine, but Suspiria is very much a movie that takes more than one viewing.e, tension and plenty of scares. And again I go back to Dario's visual style, which is what makes him stand out so much and again that is what makes Suspiria so brilliant. As I stated before the opening act is downright chilling and while the movie might slightly slow down it never loses the eerie feeling. The visual aspect and use of colors are the most amazing I have ever seen. Again Suspiria is simply a beautiful movie to look at.    Another thing Suspiria has going for it is the score by Goblin; these guys are just amazing and have worked with Argento several times and Claudio Simonetti of Goblin has worked with Argento on almost all his movies and he's probably my favorite composer of all time. The score by Goblin is just mind-blowing and their score adds so much to the movie and makes it downright chilling! It's really hard to say, which score by Goblin is their best these guys have done such great work with Argento and with other filmmakers as well, but in the case of Suspiria, well this could easily be rated as their best score.    As I stated earlier in my review if you've seen Suspiria and didn't like it give it another chance and if your opinion doesn't change than the movie just isn't for you. But Suspiria is a movie that might take a couple of viewings; many fans of this movie disliked it at first and like I said I was one of those people as well. Forget the plot and all that and watch Suspiria for its visuals and you might just start to like it.     Suspiria in my opinion is a classic horror flick and deserves all the hype it gets. Many hail this as Dario Argento's best flick and while I understand why I'm not sure I would rate this as my favorite by him, but no doubt it's in my top 5 and in my top 20 favorite horror flicks of all time. For those new to Dario Argento I would recommend you check out his work in order; this way you can see how he evolved as a filmmaker. Suspiria is a movie you'll love or hate, but I urge people who disliked this to giveit another chance and if you still dislike it that's fine, but Suspiria is very much a movie that takes more than one viewing.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Alas.. The album I've been waiting for.  Cover to cover Shogun shows the developed Trivium of recent years blended perfectly with the raw agression of earlier efforts.  The last two albums I've enjoyed but always had some sort of issue holding me back from really placing this band amongst the greats. i.e. Ascendancy was good but needed more depth.. The Crusade was good but the vocals and song writing were lacking... There is nothing for me to nay-say on this one.  A 5 star album all the way through.  Trivium are walking the path to greatness, setting themselves aside from others in the genre.  It doesn't sound like Metallica or Maiden, it sounds like Trivium.  If this is a sign of things to come I think the metal community has much to look forward to.. I just hope the guys stay heavy and off mainstream radio.  Although I think they are fully capable, I don't think we need a \\"black album.\\" Rock/Roll.. I'm seeing them on Monday, I know these songs are going to F***ing tear live.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Standing out against a backdrop containing a depressing number of boring sitcoms, brain-dead reality shows, and interchangeable law-enforcment procedurals, Mad Men is the kind of show that's been hastening my abandonment of network TV over the past several years.  Chronicling a year (roughly) in the life of Madison Avenue ad agency Sterling Cooper, Mad Men enfolds an unapologetic look at early-1960's American society into an intelligent and occasionally comedic drama series.  While the massive buzz might suggest otherwise, Mad Men is not in fact the best thing to happen to TV since color--the pacing could use some work, and the dialogue isn't always as clever or profound as it's obviously meant to be--but it's still nice to see a show this unabashedly cool and thoroughly absorbing.  Largely forgoing contrived plot twists and tiresome histrionics, the show instead breezes by on its unforced charm and subtle character dynamics.  Much has been made of the Mad Men's exacting recreation of a bygone era, and that attention to detail spills into every aspect of the show, giving it a colorful, vivid look and feel unlike anything else on TV.  Even when the characters aren't doing anything consequential, as in a late-season episode showing the staff killing time during the presidential election with the bosses gone, it's a blast just to watch them hang out.<br /><br />Like many of the best shows of the past decade or so (think The Shield, The Wire, The Sopranos, etc.), Mad Men manages to juggle multiple plot and character arcs, generally bringing things along slowly until the pace accelerates in the wrenching final few episodes.  At the same time, its novel setting in the early 1960's and its high levels of personal, professional ,and sexual intrigue ensure that it manages to stand on its own as a compelling watch.  Especially fascinating is seeing the freewheeling portrayal of behaviors now considered archaic if not outright evil: rampant adultery and sexist objectification, smoking (even during pregnancy!), drunk driving, and, in one strangely alluring scene, the main character's mega-babe wife shooting the neighbor's birds in her backyard while puffing away on a cigarette.  Even though the show depicts a great deal of what would now be considered misbehavior, it never passes judgment on its characters or their era, nor does it engage in pointless nostalgia.  It just presents likeably flawed characters living by the conventions of a different time and leaves viewers to judge for themselves.<br /><br />While Mad Men does an admirable job of developing a sizeable ensemble cast(which has continued in its even better second season), there's no question that the central character in the drama is Don Draper, Sterling Cooper's vaguely mysterious creative director.  Played in career-making fashion by the suitably stoic and square-jawed Jon Hamm, Don is easily one of the most unpredictable and inscrutable leading men on TV, not quite a hero and not quite an anti-hero, but a compelling figure nonetheless.  My wife succintly described him as a \\"jerk,\\" and while that label isn't entirely inaccurate, the writers gradually fill in the details of Don's past and reveal what's going on beneath his seemingly soulless exterior.  Even as he drinks heavily, cheats on his wife, and belittles subordinates, it's somehow easy to forgive Don his flaws, especially as the season wears on and the writers take us further into his head.  Similarly, a collection of (somewhat) ancillary characters who may intially seem one-note--reserved secretary Peggy Olsen, hard-living boss Roger Sterling, Machiavellian striver Pete Campbell, seductive office manager Joan Holloway--have their own aspirations and internal conflicts come out over time.<br /><br />Mixing single-episode plots with longer storylines, along with the running thread of the Nixon-Kennedy presidential race (with Sterling Cooper working for Nixon), Mad Men has a lot going on from the very first episode.  Fora show as busy and ambitious as it is, though, Mad Men remains extremely restrained and consistent, with few deviations from its focus on character and setting.  I for one found the plots focusing on Don's home life and his romantic entanglements less interesting than the show's examination of the workings of a business circa 1960 and the psychological underpinnings of advertising, but pretty much everyone should be able to find something here to enjoy.  Throughout its first season Mad Men keeps the complexity level high and rarely panders to its audience, which are qualities that just about everyone should be able to get behind.bitious as it is, though, Mad Men remains extremely restrained and consistent, with few deviations from its focus on character and setting.

B00006AW2S|5.0|This work would earn a 5-star rating for just one song, one of the greatest rock and roll songs ever--&quot;(I can't get no) satisfaction.&quot; But there is a lot more.  There are solid covers of songs by artists such as Otis Redding (e.g., &quot;Mercy, Mercy&quot;), Sam Cooke (&quot;Good Times&quot;), and Marvin Gaye (&quot;Hitch Hike&quot;). There are also early classics by Jagger-Richards, such as &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; &quot;&quot;The Last Time,&quot; and &quot;Play with Fire.&quot; And cool little songs such as &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot; and &quot;The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man&quot;. And remember that any song attributed to &quot;Nanker Phelge&quot; (such as the aforementioned &quot;The Under Assistant. . .&quot;) is a Rolling Stones' composition.<br /><br />Some representative works (that is, songs that I want to write about). . . .<br /><br />&quot;Mercy Mercy&quot;: This opens the album/CD, an Otis Redding song.  Mick Jagger gives a nice, credible blues version of this piece. There is raw and primal guitar work to back his singing.<br /><br />&quot;The Last Time&quot;: This is one of the Stones' best early songs.  There is a nice guitar riff to open this work. The rhythm section (Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman) lay down a good base for this song.

Even though my preference was classical music, I understood that this was something special. The fuzz tone riff by Keith Richards at the outset suggests that this is serious business. One typical line that resonated, I'm sure, with many who listened to this:<br /><br />&quot;I can't get no satisfaction. . . .<br />Baby, baby maybe come back next week<br />Cuz' you see I'm on a losing streak.&quot;<br /><br />Drums, bass, and guitars work well together.

The time in which I saw the movie was a tumultuous one and Kate spoke to me as a character.  She finds love where she least expects while giving her cheating fiance his comeuppance.  Luc is as sweet as he is street-tough, with the heart of an artist. Their final union is gratifying each viewing.  I am happy to finally have my own copy to watch many more times.

0756404746|5.0|In the first book of The Kingkiller Chronicles we meet Kvothe, a powerful magician who ashamed of his past has retired to run an inn at the edge of his civilized world. With the help of an assistant who is more than he seems, he attends to the simple people of the village hoping to be left alone.     But an unknown evil from the outside world is advancing towards this remote place and, willingly or not, he must confront it. And while he does, we are introduced to his early life as a story he tells to a chronicler who has come to the village looking for him.    Kvothe's story of his early years, full of adventure and heartbreak, resonates with the reader. He may be a very talented musician and fearless hero but he is also a very lost child. Left alone in the world after an event that will shape his future forever, he must learn how to survive on his own. From feral child to impoverished student, he struggles to keep his dignity, hoping to learn the name of the wind that, he believes, will introduce him to a world of power he guesses exists beyond the known world.    The Name of the Wind is an engaging story with outcast characters you will fall in love with despite, or maybe because of, their flaws. Highly recommended.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|I'll be rather straight-forward, I like this much better than Planet Terror. I know I am in the minority, but I can only express my own feelings. On the visceral level, it was truly high impact. On the emotional level, the many characters are given smart, sassy and even thought provoking dialogue. Tarantino should be applauded for taking a chance on what he wanted to do. I will furthermore state; this is a better film than Kill Bill Vol.One.
0316066524|5.0|Sadly, IJ will forever now remain as DFW's crowning piece of work.  We'll always have to wonder how many more IJs and beyond he had in him.    That said, this book is incomprehensibly fantastic.  I'm not sure many, if any, could understand the full breadth of it.  But, there is something here for every reader.  Stephen Hawking, as well as your fourteen year old sister could read it and recognize part of their existence in it.  That's part of its majesty.    The real majesty is nothing more than Wallace, himself.  His mind was a tormented, brilliant, colossal thing...and much of it is laid out for us here.  A must read for everyone.  Even if you don't finish the footnotes.

0789318121|2.0|This book is a complete joke.  Anyone who has seen the movie will read this book for more insight about everything behind-the-scenes.  The stunts, the costumes, the sets, the special effects.  Unfortunately, this book has none of that.  The deepest it delves is into how Heath Ledger shook his head to make his eyeliner smear more.  75% of this book is the script.  I don't care about the script, I watched the movie, and know what happens in every scene.  I wanted to know how they made the Two-Face character from CGI, I wanted to know how they rigged the stunt scenes, I wanted to know how they built the cars and cycles.  Instead, in this book, everything is glossed over like the pages it's printed on.  They might as well have written on the final page: \\"See the Blu-ray for behind-the-scenes information about the movie!\\", because you already know everything that's written here.  It's common sense.

B0015FML06|5.0|I'm just reviewing the DVD here. I have watched this concert countless times on VHS. In fact, I wore it out, and had to buy another copy on ebay (it was out of print.) I have never gotten tired of it, but I really wanted a DVD release. I've purchased every other U2 concert video, and have seen them live twice. But I have never felt I have \\"outgrown\\" Under a Blood Red Sky; because it's all there. The embryo of everything they would do in the future is seen in this concert. The passion, the showmanship, the musicianship, and epic sound from simple instruments.     If you liked the VHS release, you will love this. More songs are included in this DVD, and the sound and picture are great (with a slight exception below.) If you have never seen this concert yet, do yourself a favor and get this. Even if you are not a U2 fan, but if you just enjoy good music and a good performance, give it  try. I knew hardly anything about U2 when I first watched this many years ago, and it drew me in immediately, and didn't let go. I just wanted to watch it again.     Note: Like others here, I was disappointed with the Electric Co. edit, but I'm sure it was unavoidable. This has been an ongoing issue, so it's no surprise that they had to cut the coda.    EXCEPTION TO SOUND QUALITY: The opening sequence, with the Clannad song, sounds terrible. Maybe it's better in 5.1 than stereo (which is how I watched it), but you can hardly hear the song at all. I had to \\"gain ride\\" the volume with my remote to hear it, then crank it down for the concert itself.     ABOUT THOSE WAVY RED LINE: Anyone \\"of a certain age\\" is no doubt familiar with seeing wavy red lines all the time on TV shows featuring bright lights or reflections. This is an artifact of the television technology of the time. This concert was recorded on video, using television cameras of the time. Bright lights \\"burn\\" into the picture tube, leaving and afterimage. It looks like a line, because as the light moves through the frame, it leaves a streak, like drawing a line with your finger in the sand. THE WAVY LINES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE. It's less noticeable on the VHS for 2 reasons: the VHS image isn't as sharp to begin with, and the picture is further softened by video grain. It obscures some of the lines, along with obscuring other details of image. The DVD gives a sharper picture, which means everything in the original recording is sharper, including the after image artifacts. The funny thing is, having been raised watching live performances using \\"old time\\" television equipment, I came to equate those lines with the excitement of a live performance! So, RELAX. IT'S NOT A FLAW IN THE \\"FILM,\\" IT'S SIMPLY HOW ALL SIMILAR VIDEO RECORDINGS OF THE ERA LOOK. IF YOU WATCH, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE LINES BEING \\"DRAWN' AT CERTAIN POINTS AS A LIGHT MOVES THROUGH THE FRAME. Do not let this distract you from enjoying a fantastic concert!    Edited to add: If you watch the DVD with director's commentary, he directly addresses the red streaks, and the choice he made to shoot into the lights with handheld cameras, which produced that artifact. The director used that technique in his UK show The Tube, and the American crew was not happy with his choice to use this technique. He feels that it adds to the excitement and immediacy of the event, as I mentioned above.

0452270073|4.0|In Regeneration, Pat Barker fictionalises an encounter between H. R. Rivers and Siegfrid Sasson in a military psychological hospital. In Craiglockhart, near Edinburgh, there are numerous war wounded, whose experiences in the Flanders trenches of the First World War have left them psychologically, as well as sometimes physically scarred. The symptoms are many and varied. In Sassoon's case it is possible that the motivation might even be political, rather than psychological.<br /><br />Rivers attempts to analyse his patients and his own responses to them. He is of the modern school, unlikely to resort to the blunt-edged methods of some of his contemporaries. Description of some of these established treatments read very much like torture. They were, after all, in the cases described, trying to make someone talk. How appropriate.<br /><br />But Rivers is unimpressed and he pursues his own line. Along the way, he also develops new, ground-breaking treatments of his own invention.<br /><br />Sassoon befriends a young man called Owen, whom he encourages to write. Another friend called Graves visits whenever he can. Together, Sassoon and Owen work on some of Owen's writing. The results, they both agree, are improvements.<br /><br />The power of Regeneration is the relation between its overall idea and its setting. It presents the creative process as a reflection on experience and sets this in an institution where formal reflection on experience is a treatment. Eventually, it is not just the individual patient who benefits from the cathartic process of reflection, but also the analyst and, ultimately, all of us when the relief takes the form of great poetry.

B0010X745K|3.0|After a raging storm that knocks out all power, David Drayton and his young son Billy head into town for supplies.  Along for the ride is neighbor Norton, whom David doesn't normally get along with.  Before leaving home, David and his family wonder about the strange mist hovering over the lake.  Once in town, he discovers the power is out there too, and the checkout lines in the grocery store are long.<br /><br />Then, they notice the mist rolling across the store's parking lot.  They hear screams, and a large earthquake-like thud shakes the store and silences the air raid siren.  A man runs into the store from the mist, informing the people that there's \\"things\\" out there.  Now trapped inside the store, the large crowd wonders what to do and who to believe.  Shopper Mrs. Carmody, a crazy lady from town, works the desperate crowd into a frenzy of religious fanaticism.  There ARE things in the mist, tentacles and large bugs and flying daemons, and as Mrs. Carmody preaches the end of the world and expiation via blood, David must find a way to save himself and his son, and the few who follow him.<br /><br />I can't help but compare the movie to the story, which I've read several times and consider it one of King's best stories (before he lost his talent and began writing drool).  In the book, King really captured the crowd mentality when people are shoved together in a tight place.  It didn't work as well in the movie translation.  In my summary of the plot, I tried to stay true to the movie, which in all fairness follows the book quite well until the ending.  I was disappointed in the movie for several reasons.  The director used all unknown actors, no big names to anchor the film.  The acting was rather wooden, and Mrs. Carmody should have been older and fatter (plus I miss the bright yellow pantsuit she wore in the book).  The FX was ok but not spectacular.  The scriptwriter changed the ending, and not for the better.  What this film really needed was a bigger budget to make it work; it's not grisly enough to be 'B' horror, and not performed well enough for mainstream films.  All in all, it turns out to be just a mediocre film that didn't live up to my expectations.  Rent, don't buy.

I loved the message of the book but the sexual inuendo and reference was completely out of place and distracted from the story. My husband bought the book for my almost 13 year old because it was on the shelf next to the Twilight series. I read it after her and was horrified by what she had read without my knowing so I have to go into damage repair mode. I am by no means a prude - I love Nora Roberts and others - but this CRAP is completely not needed for teens and pre-teens today; they get bombarded enough without having it in books marketed for their age range. I'm extremely disappointed in the Mother/Daughter team that put this together and will have CAST on my list of never buy and never recommend. Too bad!
B001AZI1PA|3.0|Dark Crystal  When I was younger, I had a chance to see this movie. Over the years, I forgot about it. I just happened to run across it at a department store a few weeks ago and my memory clicked back on. After reading through other reviews, I decided this puppet-filled fantasy flick would be worth the 9-dollar price tag. After this viewing of the film, I felt disappointed. At the same time, I enjoyed the concept of the film.    A thousand years ago, the Dark Crystal was broken. Upon the Crystal being broken, two new races appear. One race is the gentle, slow moving Mystics. The other race is the evil Skeksis. The Skeksis have control over the Dark Crystal and use it to reign supreme in this fantasy world. Ten of the Skeksis are still alive; ten of the Mystics are alive. Jen, a young Gelfling, had his family and most of his race killed by the Skeksis. The reason for this is a prophecy says that a Gelfling will force the Skeksis out of power. Jen has just learned that his destiny is to find the Crystal's missing shard and heal the Dark Crystal.    The movie follows Jen on his journey to find the shard and heal the Crystal. This is not a LOTR type journey though. This movie faces some major problems along the way. The actual movie just plays out very badly. There is one scene where the Skeksis are eating. They just seem to eat forever for no reason at all. This could have taken out, and maybe something interesting could have been added. There is also a repetitious route taken in this movie. Jen will arrive somewhere that seems safe, than he will be attacked by Garthim (the Skeksis's henchmen). Watching the movie feels like a chore at times due to these problems.    The soundtrack in this movie is fantastic. The music will always match the mood trying to be conveyed. However, it does not sound perfect on this DVD. Keep in mind that is movie was made in the 80s and the transfer cannot go through flawless. The voice acting in this movie is a serious problem. The narratorcomes off completely monotone and boring. Jen sounds okay, but many others in this film come off emotionless. This is all largely due to the entire movie being made of puppets. Puppets simply cannot express emotion as humans can.    This version of the film came with no extras. I think a commentary or making-of feature would be highly enjoyable. The only thing you get is previews. I am not sure, if that is because it is the digital copy, or if only the collector's edition has extras. If you have to buy one version, I suggest the Collector's Edition. The digital transfer is completely pointless unless you would like to waste your computer's space. You can put this on a video-capable I-Pod, PSP, or PS3 if that is your wish. The Digital portion of this film expires though. If you are expecting to buy this used, be warned that the Digital copy may have expired.    There are parts of Dark Crystal that I enjoyed. Despite their lack of sentiment, I loved the design of the puppets. Considering all the characters in the movie are Jim Henson designed puppets, I am glad that they are well done. The story is also interesting. It may come off as typical fantasy, but the story has a certain appeal to it. The world is designed great. It all comes off as fake, but again has a certain appeal to it.    One thing you need to avoid doing is renting this movie in any format and expecting to like this movie. If you are going to enjoy this movie, you are going to need to learn to love it. Watching it a couple times over a long period of time will allow Dark Crystal to grow on you. The problems in this will prevent this from being great though. If you are into fantasy, try this one.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|After the success of \\"The Terminator\\" in 1984, it strikes me as somewhat odd that there wasn't a sequel rushed directly into production as soon as the original was deemed a hit. Nowadays, it seems like once a movie surpasses what it cost to make the movie then a sequel is virtually inevitable. This also seemed to be the mindset around certain movies back in the 1980's, especially the slasher type of films; but for whatever reason seven long years passed between the release of \\"The Terminator\\" before director and writer James Cameron re-teamed with his stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton for \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\".    \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" picks up approximately ten or so years after the events of the first film. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been locked away in a mental institution after her crazed warnings of an impending holocaust at the hands of machines, and her 10-year old son John (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents. After the initial failure of the first Terminator to complete its mission of eliminating Sarah, the evil Skynet has sent back an even more advanced model, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), to hunt down and kill her son John before he can grow up to become the leader of the human resistance. However, John's future self is not without his own resources as he has sent back a weapon of his own to protect his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) identical to the one that attempted to kill his mother ten years before.    A general rule about movies is that nine times out of ten the sequel may be on par with the original film, but rarely will it ever surpass what had come before; however, I feel very confident in saying that \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" is easily one prime example of an exception to that rule. \\"The Terminator\\" was an excellent sci-fi movie that mixed futuristic elements with those of the modern day, but some may have wondered what more story could there possibly be since Sarahdefeated the first Terminator, which should have saved her son and the future as well. Based on what I saw in \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\", or \\"T2\\" for short, what happened in the original was merely the beginning of a much bigger problem for mankind.    Writer/director James Cameron has once more crafted an extremely taut, perfectly paced, sci-fi thriller that is leaps and bounds above what was done in the first movie. The story for \\"T2\\" is much bigger, the drama is more intense, the action is pulse-pounding, and the visual effects are still incredible even to this day. James Cameron must have known that he was merely laying the initial groundwork in \\"The Terminator\\" for a vast mythology surrounding mankind's future against the evil machines, because that last scene in the original movie hinted that something bigger may be on the horizon. Even though so many of us had seen the first movie and caught on to the hint that there may be more to tell, who knew it would be this massive blockbuster of a film that remains just as popular all these years later. Where the first film briefly touched upon Skynet and gave us brief glimpses at the war that awaits us in the future, \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" takes all of that and builds upon it greatly. \\"T2\\" explores how events in the original movie actually set into motion the events of the future, shows us a very emotionally raw heroine in Sarah Connor, a different side to the Terminator from the first film, and to top it off gave us even more glimpses into the future battles that will ravage mankind. The only thing I can say about the story for \\"T2\\" is that it is simply awesome, and is quite possibly one of the greatest follow-up story's I have ever seen come out of Hollywood.    The cast of \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" is comprised of a few familiar faces and some new ones as well. Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor with a much more emotionally charged performance than what was required of her in the original movie. Sarah is a completely different person than she was when we last saw her, now she is this highly trained warrior that is emotionally scarred and torn by what she feels to be her duty to train her son to become the leader of man, and yet to still protect him and care for him as her child. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, just as he promised in the first movie, as a reprogrammed Terminator, and proves yet again that this was the one role that he was born to play. Even though the character is just a machine, there are very neat moments within the movie where without saying much of anything, Arnold allows the Terminator to convey that there is some kind of connection that exists, a bond if you will, between the Terminator and John. James Cameron's script really aided Arnold in what he was able to do with the Terminator this time around by exploring the fact that the machines can learn from and mimic humans, which allowed Arnold to show some, albeit limited, emotions while still remaining in character.    Joining the returning cast members we have newcomer Edward Furlong (\\"American History X\\") as John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance. Considering the fact that \\"T2\\" was his first acting gig, Edward did an amazing job of bringing John to life in a very realistic way as a troubled kid whose destiny is too big for him to possibly fathom. The way Edward handled John's interactions with the Terminator was very interesting, because early on John sees the machine as a means to an end, nothing more than an overgrown action figure of sorts; however, over the course of the movie he begins to form a bond with the Terminator that becomes almost like a father-son relationship, that was at times quite poignant. The other new addition to the series was actor Robert Patrick (\\"We Are Marshall\\") as the new, deadlier, and much more sophisticated T-1000 Terminator model. Robert was given a very physically challenging role that required a lot of physical activity, but from an acting standpoint the role didn't really challenge him all that much. That being said, as unchallenging as it was onscreen in the acting realm, I'm sure the preparation for all of the visual effects associated with his character were most likely quite time consuming and at times daunting.    In the first movie the visual effects were very good, especially given the time at which the film was made, although over time I admit that some of the effects have lost their luster. While that statement is true for 1984's \\"The Terminator\\", it couldn't be farther from the truth when referring to the stellar special effects work done for 1991's \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\". While technology has definitely improved significantly since 1991, the effects within this movie still hold up quite well, and while maybe not as perfect as today's effects, they are still very impressive in their own right. For example the morphing technology, used to create the numerous effects sequences for the liquid Terminator, was so mind-blowing back in 1991, and yet even today it still looks astonishing.    As I stated earlier, while \\"The Terminator\\" was a great movie, what James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger were able to achieve with the sequel \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" is simply amazing. Everything about this movie is just bigger and better than what was done in the original film, and this is an example of the kind of sequel that all studios should strive for when making a franchise.    \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Frankly, the music of Sufjan Stevens is a bit too twee and precious for my everyday tastes, but I'll be the first to admit that he comes close to touching something that exists in all of us -- that innate and intangible sense of \\"place\\" and \\"home\\" the likes of which famed authors John Steinbeck and Thomas Wolfe respectively attempted to dispel and recapture. This is more than simple reportage and anecdote; it's nothing less than a youthful attempt to get one's arms around the unifying spirit of, what seems obvious to Stevens, this \\"nation under God\\" -- something for both believers and agnostics to appropriately ponder.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Such a great CD!!! There is not one song on here that I don't skip through. They all have a great beat to them and are energetic. I love the book that comes with this and shows you pictures and Madonna's thoughts.     GREAT ITEM!!

0385340567|1.0|This is not the Jack Reacher that put Lee on the map. Hey Lee - - what were you thinking?  An awful book for all the reasons (and more) that were stated by previous reviewers.
B0014I4KIK|2.0|I'm so disapointed in the fact that I paid for this CD and she received a portion of what i spent on it. I love all types of music but this was just plan bad. She has a LOVELY voice but what was on the producers mind when this album was put together?!?!? It's not her voice, it not her lyrics, it just seems like this was album was thrown together. I wouldn't be surprised if the entire thing was put together in 1 day. It's horrible.
0375826726|3.0|So far I like the book, but I have one question/concern.  Why all the gore. Why start with hands being cut off. And why the trial of the long knives-- I actually felt sick after that chapter. That's as far as I've gotten, but felt that someone should say something. You may want to pre-read this book before your younger child reads it, it's pretty intense. On the other hand in a culture where the sadism of the joker is celebrated in Batman maybe this is now considered normal. But to go on for pages in Paolini's intense, almost purple, writing style is just too much for me. I'm going to read the rest of the story because I genuinely enjoyed the first two-- and because I like dragons and elves, and enjoy Paolini's world. But I really wonder why all this gore???
080701429X|5.0|Let me share part of the first paragraph of Harold S Kushner's introduction:<br /><br />\\"Typically, if a book has one passage, one idea with the power to change a person's life, that alone justifies reading it, rereading it, and finding room for it on one's shelves. This book has several such passages.\\"<br /><br />There's nothing more to add to that, really. You can read the other reviews to get an indication of why I say that passage is accurate, but it most assuredly is.  Maybe I should've bought the hardback...
B00003CXWV|4.0|The movie is one of my favorites but in the bonus features I would have liked to hear more of George Jung's thoughts and stories.
B001DHXT1G|2.0|Plotless, pointless and pedantic, the new reboot of Marvel's jade-jawed giant is as mindless as their monster.    Featuring a far wimpier (and less agile) Hulk then the first installment, this worthless romp was clearly crafted to bridge the synaptic clefts of children.    Bottom Line: fast-paced fodder for adolescents and adults with bad to average tastes.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this item about a year ago and never really got around to watching it til this month, but as soon as I popped that first DVD in, I remembered why I got it. This film series has unprecedented footage, the most beautiful scenery, the most exotic creatures, the most advanced technology... There is just nothing out there that compares to the majesty of this series. I know that I will keep these for as long as I can and share it with friends and family because it takes your breath away to observe the planet you live on in such a spectacular way. No complaints about quality, price, anything. This product is one of a kind!
B001FEA9QU|4.0|Since the last few albums have created a cult of whiny Metallica fans that think it's so cool to wax poetic about the good ole days, maybe this album will finally put an end to the geeky black shirts dribble. This latest release seems to have that edge makes you want to get out the old air guitar and start head bobbing to that raucous energy again.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|I'm glad they went back to the heavy stuff and brought back the screams but probably doesn't have the death metal it had in ascendacy but screams and heavy stuff is good enough for me.I am not a trash metal fan i only like it with brutal sounds and angry screams or growls and that's what trivium does.But it is not like ascendacy cause in ascendacy it only had a couple of trash metal stuff,more screaming than singing and death metal influences.Think of this album as the crusade but with more trash metal influences and add screams and brutal stuff and there you go.But this is still a great heavy album and i'm sick of people who hate trivium they are nothing but METAL.GET THIS ABLUM ASCENDACY IS BETTER BUT THIS STILL RULES!
B000KJU1HI|4.0|Many productions you are expecting music and all you get is \people talking about each other and occasionally mentioning the artist. Ties is a great documentary as instead of people talking about each other you get a candid look at the artists, on and off the stage.<br /><br />I was surprise to see such a young Joan Baez and it was fun to listen to her and Bob singing Hank Williams' songs.<br /><br />Just as I was about to be disappointed because other than &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; I thought we would never get a full song until I realized that there were extras with full track extras:<br />&quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot; May 10, 1965<br /> &quot;It's All Over Now&quot;/ &quot;Baby Blue&quot; May 10, 1965<br /> &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot; May 9, 1965<br /> &quot;The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll&quot; May 10, 1965<br /> &quot;To Ramona&quot; May 4, 1964<br /><br />I enjoyed the banter between Terry Ellis (science student) and Bob.<br />Then if you look quickly you will see Marianne Faithfull Soundtrack (writer: &quot;Witches Song&quot;) in the movie &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996).<br /><br />Now we must say good-by to Bob Dylan's last acoustic tour.<br /><br />DON'T LOOK BACK<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000A0GP4K Bob Dylan - No Direction Home]]
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|It is a heavy album and only the song \\"all hope is gone\\" is the one i can call brutal and maybe one of the first ones too.I was a bit dissapointed cause the band said the album was gonna be really heavy and the truth is,it's not heavy as f**k like they said it would be,heavy but not like you expect.The melodic singing is not like the old slipknot is stone sour singing and the slow song sucks unlike the other albums but it's okay.If you call yourself a maggot(i'm not,just like them)then get this album.The last song is kinda technical death metal which is my favorite one but in my opinion iowa is still the heaviest album slipknot have done and not to mention corey doesn't give those big screams he used to i mean his voice sounds like in iowa but doesn't scream like in the old songs like,eyeless,sic,people=sh**,the heretic anthem,he just lost it but what's best for mainstream crap huh?Still good album and recommend it and they are completeley done with the nu metal crap for good.

0765348780|1.0|I bought the first 2 of this series based on the exciting reviews. I must begin with I just don't get it. My guess is that the people who enjoyed this would be thrilled by a solid black jigsaw puzzle. And I respect that, but not for me. I read the entire first book hoping it would come together but there are just too many characters and vague subplots for me to care about. It is simply to vague, exhausting, and the only real tension is in figuring out who the newest character is.
0439023483|5.0|This was an incredible novel, a story about life and what your willing to do to keep it. Throughout the story, which takes place in the ruins of a place once known as North America, Katniss Everdeen will have to face betrayal, love, murder, and near starvation while participating in the annual Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are the Capitol's way of punishing the 12 Districts for the revolt that occurred years ago. As revenge, they choose two children between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district, a boy and a girl. These children are forced to compete in an event where, quite literally, the last one alive wins. There are no rules to the hunger games, although cannibalism is frowned upon. When Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is chosen as a candidate, she risks her life to take her place.   I highly recommend this book. It's an incredibly woven tale that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.
1400064287|3.0|Service was good, delivered on time. BUT i thought i was saving by ordering on amazon when i realized that once the delivery charge was added, it actually doubled the price of the book...  To go from $8 to $16 price tag for shipping does not justify the process. Will be careful about that next time...
1595141715|5.0|I picked this book up because I was a bit intrigued by the synopsis on the inside cover. I was away for the weekend, and I figured that this would help get me through.  I devoured it in one sitting.  Once you start this book, it is nearly impossible to put it down. The plot is centered around a young girl's suicide tapes, in which she gives thirteen reasons why she took her life. The reasons center around thirteen different people with seemingly no connection whatsoever.   Clay, who receives the tapes, has no idea what he did that related to Hannah's suicide. Throughout the story, he finds out.  This book was amazing. After reading it I couldn't fall back asleep; My head was buzzing. It's a truly haunting and valuable tale that will actually make you think.
0688170528|4.0|I have read The Pact twice and both times felt that Emily was being  molested by her father.  This explains her suicide, her secret she would not share with Chris,  her obvious depression as a result and her difficulties with sex.  She was molested by the 'kid' at the fast food restaurant but as I   read and re-read this book I do feel there was molestation by her  father.  Hard to believe because he was a likable character.  Alas, he was not.  A good read and hard to put down.
B001DDBCUA|3.0|Loved the series, thought the movie was fairly predictable. (Caution - spoilers ahead!)  When the big wedding/big dress came, I thought \\"wow, that's generally the climatic ending\\" and so was not totally unsurprised that Big choked.  Anyhoo ... everybody has loads of money and can fly around the world at the drop of a hat (or the jilting of a bride.)  That's nice ... and totally unbelievable.  When Charlotte had her \\"accident\\" in Mexico, even my husband commented \\"laughing at that is just mean\\"; I wouldn't want my friends laughing at me for something so deeply humiliating.  Carrie was just as good as deflecting blame away from herself as ever; when Miranda finally tells her she told Big they were crazy to get married, Carrie acts like THAT was the reason he didn't show up for the wedding.  I REALLY didn't like her character much after that.  But in the end, everybody lives happily ever after and/or reverts back to type: Carrie & Big are together, Miranda & Steve reconcile; Charlotte finally has a biological child; and Samantha is happily on her own.  I'm not sorry I saw this movie, but I doubt I'd watch another sequel.
0452289963|5.0|I found this book heavy going at first.  While reading the first four chapters I felt like saying, \\"I get the point, get over your own ego man\\", but I think he realised I got it at this stage and he took off.  I really did laugh out loud reading this book.  He's spot on about the ego. It's so easy to see it in everybody else but he really shows it in yourself.  Think everybody should have to read this book before you're let loose on the earth.  Excellent.
B000002I6T|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Byrds and CSN(Y), but I always felt the Crosby was more of a weak link who happend to be in the right place at the right time TWICE. This solo effort is proof positive that before the ego got overblown and the drug intake out of hand, David Crosby was more than capable of writing and performing some really good music on his own. There is an etheral quality to this album that is hard to describe but is very pleasant and the all-star musicians who participated in this project made sure that the presentation was top-notch. The album is NOT \\"overproduced\\" at all and I am glad that I gave it a chance, I really like it!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is a stunning film with strong characterization, amazing action and enthralling epic atmosphere. Jeff Daniels does his best film work ever as the Colonel from Maine who does a desperate bayonet charge to stop the Confederate onslaught. That single event held the line. The other actors are stellar, including Tom Berenger, Sam Elliott, and Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee. I especially liked Richard Jordan (Confederate general Lewis A. Armistead) whose dearest friend was in the Union Army. The heartbreak that Jordan conveys in wanting to see his friend, separated by this war is so palpable that it's just heart renching.<br /><br />This film is a Must See for anyone interested in America and American History.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|'Return of the Living Dead Part II' tried to re-capture the lightning-in-a-bottle so brilliantly achieved by the original. It fails on all levels. This time around the comedy is more abundant, but nothing is funny here. The effects are bad, the acting is atrocious... and THE MUSICAL SCORE HAS GIVEN ME EAR CANCER. I found out shortly after viewing this turd that the music on the DVD is not the original score. Believe me, 'ROTLD2' might be a hair better if the original music was in place, but it's still a failed attempt at zombie comedy. I felt bad for James Karen and Thom Matthews as they stumbled around trying to be like their characters from the first movie. It's really quite embarrassing to behold. Do yourself a favor and buy the excellent 'Return of the Living Dead' and pretend its four sequels never happened.
B000VPUIA6|3.0|Bought this at the beginning of the month on one of the Gold Box sales....Had to take advantage of it as i wanted the Deluxe Set but didn't want to pay the big $$$$..  As it turns out that was a great move as i just don't think this thing is worth $120.00.. Don't get me wrong , i love the band , i love the movies , but the extras weren't all that exciting....
0143038419|3.0|A memoir about Gilbert's journey through Italy, India, and Indonesia following her painful divorce.  The book is divided into 3 equal sections.  The first, and my favorite, details her gustatory journey through Italy.  She then goes on to discover spirituality in India and, finally, love in Indonesia.  I did not find the book particularly inspiring or uplifting though I wouldn't go so far as to say I disliked it.  Again, I found the journey through Italy to be humorous and lighthearted.  As for the rest?  It didn't quite deliver.

0375826726|3.0|Brisingr was not near as good as the 1st 2 books in the series.  The story meandered around too much.  Too many uneeded side plots like dwarf politics.  The book could have been cut in size and still been able to finish the series with this book! I could go on on, but other peolpe have made the same points.
0007240198|5.0|Please, I beg the powers that be to print this book in the US market, it is awful that a book this important has to be imported over the Atlantic Ocean.  Although, it isn't surprising, Science is Under Attack in the United States!  In times as challenging as these, with a VP candidate who believes that the Earth is no older than the Genesis writ 6000 years, Goldacre provides a desperately needed voice of reason.  I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to others.  Ben shines a light on incompetence and criminal ignorance in a way that is both inspiring and entertaining.
B001BKG9SK|4.0|If you are an immensely huge rock and roll band (or the member of one), history has a way of catching up with you...or, if you're really lucky, coming to you. Pink Floyd is certainly one of the biggest stadium acts that popular music has ever known, and they have played more than their share of historic performances, but it seems that the truly historic moments have occurred after the band splintered. First, and most momentous of all, Roger Waters played in Berlin as the wall came down. Now it is David Gilmour's turn, who arrived in Gdansk, Poland on the anniversary date that Poland's Lech Walesa founded his country's Solidarity Movement. As a moment in history, it should well be remembered for generations to come. As a concert, it is hardly political at all, but it is still quite entertaining.<br /> David Gilmour may be performing without Pink Floyd, but the flourishes, spectacle and attention to detail are equally fastidious. Playing before what looks like ten kabillion people, and performing with a huge band and the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, this performance offers just about everything that the average Pink Floyd fan might wish for...except perhaps the tunes. Although Gilmour's keyboard player happens to be Richard Wright (R.I.P.), thus constituting 50% of the band's classic line-up, they touch lightly on Pink Floyd's classic material, focusing instead on material pulled from his latest studio disk, \\"On an Island.\\" The version of \\"Live in Gdansk\\" that I have contains four disks; two are CD's that contain the entire performance, another is a DVD that edits out some of the audio recordings. Strangely, most of the songs that are edited from the DVD are the very songs that Pink Floyd obsessives would crave, including \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Time,\\" \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" The fourth disk is another DVD containing a rather interesting documentary about the significance of playing in Gdansk, along with some performance footage.<br /> Quite clearly, this collection is aimed at fans who have followed Gilmour through his version of the post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd, and especially through his career as a solo artist. Nevertheless, the concert consists almost exclusively of exceptionally nuanced, mid-tempo, and distinctly spacey music, heavily reliant on sound and stage effects, with loads of bombast and visual appeal. Sound like any band you know? The orchestra does not do anything that is extraordinary, but the wall of strings does add plenty of atmospherics to a performance that is already top-heavy from its implied relevance. This collection comes in numerous formats, from an elaborate 5-disk set, to a simple 2-CD collection. The best version to own depends entirely on your budget, and your own degree of interest.

B00008977N|5.0|Peter Gabriel has out done himself with this one. This is a must see DVD. Great concert.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|The unique feature about Shinedown is that they are able to balance between heavy rock to the ballads on offer.      I quite like that the band appear to be taking chances instead of being content with doing the \\"same-old\\".  For example \\"Second Chance\\" is slower and more of a melodic offering. The single \\"Second Chances\\" use a heavier string presence and the guys have ensured that they don't waste time on any of the tracks.      It seems to mean that the singer's had a falling out with his parents and left them in an apparent state of anger. And because he can't talk to them, he is then using this song (his one and only voice) to tell them that he's actually not angry at them but he just needed to get away so he could have a life of his own.    His old life, with the parents, may have been secluded, since he was watching \\"the world outside\\" and left to be a part of it. Since he's telling the listener that he \\"made it through the day\\" he probably used to be very depressed with his situation, possibly even on drugs. But now he's okay (eyes open wide), and there's no need to be sorry for him, because he's living his second chance right now.    Another personal favourite on the album is bound to be with many and that is the song \\"The Crow and the Butterfly\\".     This is essentially a poem about loss and the vacant silence that one encounters when you lose someone close to you. It is most likely to be about the loss of a relationship although as a poem it could mean the loss of a non-intimate relationship, notice the use of \\"I painted your room\\" not \\"our room.\\"     What is obvious is that the author is marking the sense of loss (of the day and the person) by painting the room. With time and maturity he is losing his belief in superstition - even putting the book with the 4 leafed clovers on the top shelf.    The pictures coming off the wall indicate a sense of closure, although there's still a great sense of tenderness over them (and therefore the person lost) - in thatthe pictures are wrapped carefully in newspaper `blankets'.     The metaphor of the dandelion (seeds) being blown into the wind - and disappearing from sight against the summer sky indicates how easy the loss of the relationship happened, and that there is a permanent feeling about the loss (he won't get her back). Because he's taken her for granted (I never thought you'd slip away) and because he was too late in showing his appreciation.     The last three lines emphasise the rawness of the loss - the fact that (her) voice still echoes in his ear, and the absence has made him unable to sleep or breathe so that he feels as though he's dying.    \\"If You Only Knew\\" - the song with the extra emotional impact.  \\"What a Shame\\" seems to be the groups answer to \\"45\\".    \\"Call Me\\" is by far my ultimate favourite song on their latest offering for many reasons.  It starts out with a large piano ballad with minimal string involvement and the Brent showcases genuine emotion and conviction in his voices making it a good choice for a closing track.     Call me by Shine Down, my interpretation:   * This song is about loss of some sort, most likely the breaking up of a relationship.  * The singer seems to be taking the initiative in leaving. (\\"You know I live my like a gypsy\\" and so on)  * Another possibility is that someone has actually died. (\\"I lost my whole life and a dear friend\\")  The following is helpful in understanding my interpretation:     My only criticism and minor would be that next time there needs to be more insight into the characters of the songs that will give it a greater depth and Shinedown will then have perfected the craft. Howeever, this is a minor detail hence the 5 stars stand. They deserve it!!
B000002LEM|4.0|I was onboard with the whole Hagar/Van Halen-thing, from the very beginning. I liked the former incarnation with Roth, but Sammy brought a whole new energy and his vocals allowed them to write differently and really stretch out. Plus, at this point in their relationship with each other as a band, they were probably their happiest. Sammy and Ed were actually friends and even bought houses next to each other, writing and jamming with each other often. 5150 was a decent album, although I'm not totally crazy about the sound of the drums and even the guitar sometimes. With OU812, the band had really gelled and were firing on all cylinders. The sound of the instruments and vocals and the production is so much stronger than their prior album. The songs are much more complex and mature, structurally speaking; there's more of a groove to many of the songs. The backing vocals on this album are top notch! Obviously, there is quite a variety of sounds and styles explored on OU812, especially evidenced in songs like Finish What Ya Started and A Apolitical Blues. I've never really cared for the blues tune, but I think it's cool that they laid that one down. As for the album, as a whole, it's probably my favorite from the Hagar era. Balance is a great CD, with a consistent sound throughout, and Balance offers some good/interesting stuff, but this is the one I enjoy the most, from start to finish (-the blues song). I'm sure there were still many slagging the band and hoping they kiss and make up with Roth, but OU812 made it clear that the new Van Halen could most certainly stand on its own and rock any way they wanted.
B00192M3KI|2.0|Well, damn.  I can't say much more about this album; I was looking for a killer followup to Hold Your Colour, with all of that classic Pendulum spice and energy.  I was expecting new and inventive beats, no matter what direction they went in; I was expecting a beautifully polished shaped piece of work, weaving in subtle layers to produce a deliciously tasty whole. I'd heard that Pendulum had changed styles, gone in a different direction, and I came in thinking that whatever they did, they'd make it rock just as hard as Hold Your Colour.<br /><br />But sadly, I didn't get a lick of that from this album.  I listened to it through a couple times, and I got --- well, I'm not sure how to describe what kind of a letdown this album was.  The style isn't offensive, but the lack of finish and polish surely is.  Pendulum takes their inventive ideas from Hold Your Colour and comes up with a couple of new ones, but all the tracks go the same way on In Silico: you start off by thinking, \\"this is an interesting concept; I wonder how they'll develop it\\".  But they never do -- it's the same thing for three minutes or four minutes or seven minutes.<br /><br />The only track that comes near having the same level of taste and attention to detail is The Other Side, which is a neat fusion of oldschool Hold Your Colour-era Pendulum and almost something on the order of [[ASIN:B0001FT2US Ratatat]] with the delicious fusion of rhythm and arpeggiated leads.<br /><br />So, good try, Pendulum.  You can do what you're trying to do, but this isn't it.  My only questions after this are: what went wrong?  Where did Pendulum go?
0805079831|1.0|I suggest that everyone interested in this book listen to or read the analysis of this work at Reason magazine. It goes into more detail than I can here.     Let's get a few facts straight before I move on to my major criticism of this book: First, Friedman was opposed to the Iraq invasion. She completely neglects to mention this. Second, the students at Tiananmen Square were not protesting against the free market---they published a list of demands and turning back free market reforms was not on that list. If they had wanted what Klein claims they wanted, wouldn't they have said as much? Klein simply lies about the goals of the Tiananmen Square protests: She desecrates the memory of that glorious incident and those beautiful martyrs of freedom.     Sadly, there is nowhere nearly enough room to deal with every fallacy in this book. I strongly suggest that you track down each quote she uses and see for yourself whether her use of quotations (and facts) is at all accurate. You will see it is, for the most part, not. So I will focus on her main thesis, if it can be called that, since it isn`t much of a thesis and it really isn`t hers.     Naomi Klein's book is little more than a plagiarism of Leninist rhetoric. Lenin too railed on about the \\"imperial\\" nature of capitalism---even though the nation he founded would soon become the most \\"imperial\\" power in history. Her work is actually little more than a dumbed down version of Lenin's thesis regarding \\"excess production.\\" It is a shoddy work of scholarship unworthy of a bachelors thesis.  There are no facts supporting her ideas beyond a few misinterpreted remarks by Friedman.    There is no shock doctrine of free markets. Libertarians are, for the most part, a pacifistic bunch who only believe in using force when others use force first. Trying to draw a tie between the policies of the Bush administration and the views of economists like Friedman and Hayek is patently absurd---the Bush administration is not pro-markets: Wecan see that from the massive nationalization and socialization of the banking industry that is happening right now. The purpose of the \\"Forward Strategy of Freedom\\" (the quotes are ironic) was to establish unlimited republican democracy---not free markets. It leaves open the possibility of voting the free market down. Indeed, it allows women to vote in the very sharia law that oppresses them.    The real reason that catastrophes sometimes proceed the emergence of a free market is that free markets are able to adapt to changing conditions more quickly than socialized economies. Indeed, free and unregulated exchange is the natural condition of men when there is no interference from the state. Disasters disturb the operations of the state (and are frequently caused by the state) and so---when the big bully of government is gone---people resort to doing what is natural. Furthermore, many of the shocks Klein talks about occur because of the failures of socialism. Once socialism fails of its own accord (as Friedman, Mises, and Hayek all thought they would), people try \\"the other guy\\"---namely freedom.     If socialism were so awesome and correct, how could it be so easily disturbed or shocked by conspiratorial Cobdenites? The only answer---and the correct one---is that the failures intrinsic to socialism cause socialism to fail, not the conspiracies of free marketeers.     Any and all opposition to freedom should be suspect (and this work of shoddy scholarship is no exception). That is a sentiment that should ring true in the heart of every American---indeed, in every human heart.  The great bullies of the world have all been fascists, communists, and religious communalists: And it should never been forgotten that two of these groups were unrepentant socialists: the fascists (both German and Italian)  [Nazi means National Socialist Workers Party] and the communists were socialists.    One can only hope that Naomi Klein will next turn her thesis to an analysis WWII and claim that Churchill decided to attack the Nazis because he wanted to make way for  free markets.    [And if some idiot comes on here telling you how free the German economy was, he can shove it. Confiscating the holding of large parts of your population is not freedom. In Germany the government had final say on how everyone used his property---that is not private ownership.]
B0019T9FL6|4.0|At long last, Ms Hudson has finally released her CD.  I won't say she 'arrived' since she 'arrived' like gangbusters with Dreamgirls.  If I hadn't been so anxious for this CD, perhaps I wouldn't be as disappointed.  I feel and still do that Jennifer has the most amazing voice, stage presence and future ahead of her.  I have never fervently watched Amateur (oops,) American Idol, but I happened to tune in on a night when they had celebrity judges and I heard her sing, \\"I Made It Thru The Rain\\" and then I heard Barry Manilow tell her that she could sing the phone book and make it ring (no pun intended).  Finally this show found someone who could sing, listen to direction, take constructive criticism plus put it to good use.  But Jennifer was robbed, she should have won, and she's one of THE most successful persons to come out of that farce of a talent show.  And now it appears she got hoodwinked by the past glory of Sly Davis.  He used to have a flavor for cultivating talent by matching the right songs and producers with the artist but since senility set in all his taste is in his mouth.  Jennifer has an incredible voice, there's no denying that but this CD falls very short on showcasing it.  There are a few songs and even their lyrics that she does well on singing and phrasing.  But there are some that even with all her talent and skills she could not rise above.  On the title track she does a good job.  The song featuring Ludacrusty was not bad, they didn't need the off-color lyrics but still it showed her playful side.  Most of the other songs were listenable, especially, 'Invisible'.  I especially related to \\"You Pulled Me Through\\".  Eerily reminiscent of Phyllis Hyman's \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" both songs have religious overtones (@ least for me) and have and will serve as songs of strength.  The final track reminded me of a young piano-playing Diaretha Franklin.  However, including her showstopper from Dreamgirls, was a strategic error.  Most if not all have that soundtrack or @ least have downloaded THAT song. Why include it here, except for filler.  Now, what I can't fathom or forgive are those two dreadful duets with T-Painful and Mayonnasia.  What were they thinking and why didn't Jennifer speak up @ the mention of those two critters.  I admit, I'm not that familiar with this Painful's work, but anyone who relies on a vocoder seriously needs a tune up with a lobotomy.  How Jennifer kept pace and a straight face with that nonsense is beyond me.  Equally horrific is the pairing up with Mayonnasia.  Who in their right mind thought Mayonnasia (with all that white stuff collecting @ the cracks of her mouth when she whines) was a contender to keep up with Jennifer?  Mayonnasia sounds like an insect with a serious nasal problem.  I know the song is a homage to the days of Margie Joseph, Marlena Shaw and the like and probably with a different partner they could have pulled it off but it's excruciating.  I would have liked to have given her debut CD 5 stars but those eardrum numbing duets held me back.  Sheesh and I waited so very patiently and long for a truly dedicated Jennifer Hudson CD. This CD should be renamed Stoplight and Jennifer needs to shop around for a different spotlight to shine on her.

0688101364|5.0|Rose Levy Beranbaum is one of my favorite cookbook writers, because she is unwaveringly precise.  Her recipes are almost foolproof, provided that you follow her instructions and don't make too many ingredient substitutions.  She's a little [...] in her quest for perfection, but I'd trust her tested, detail-heavy recipes any day over recipes where I can't be sure that things will turn out right (or even be edible) the first time.<br /><br />Although the title reads \\"Christmas Cookies,\\" most of the recipes are for \\"anytime cookies.\\"  The book focuses on classics (lemon bars, gingerbread people, meringues, mexican wedding cookies, biscotti, rugelach) and has a chapter dedicated to cookies that survive shipment well.<br /><br />Out of the recipes I've tried, my favorite is the Peanut Butter and Jelly Jewels, which have a wonderful sandy texture when you bite into them.  The warm flavor of peanut butter is balanced with tart jam or creamy chocolate, depending on your preference.  (Personally, I choose the Reese's combination every time I make it.)  The lemon bars are also especially good.<br /><br />Most recipes will be easy enough for the casual baker, but there is one recipe, the Gingerbread Cathedral (p. 186-187 - check out the picture!) that I don't think I'll ever be ambitious enough to attempt.  The cathedral design features \\"stained glass\\" candy windows and flying buttresses!<br /><br />Also included is a homemade dog biscuits recipe so your favorite canine doesn't feel left out.

B001AUEMFS|5.0|I was not a fan of Coldplay in the past even though they had hit songs. But when this song came on the radio last week, I loved it.  There are not many songs you will like in one shot and usually people like songs after listening to it twice or three times but this song wasn't. Great song.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana is synonymous with the early-`90s rock scene, and even in 2008, their legacy lives on with Nevermind, the album that catapulted the band to international stardom and poster-boy status. For the next three years following its release, Nirvana enjoyed unending popularity and multi-platinum record sales up until Cobain's unfortunate suicide in 1994.<br /><br />But, going past the near-worship the album receives from so many corners of the music industry, is it really such a great album?<br /><br />Well, the answer is somewhere in the middle. The first five songs really shine, these including the famed hits \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\". Here Cobain's talents for writing melodies and hooks that, despite his constant hate towards fame, only stood to show that he was indeed capable of effortlessly writing something that spoke to millions. However, the albums momentum is quickly killed with the droning \\"Polly\\" and grating (albeit good workout song) \\"Territorial Pissings\\", which sound dated and almost juvenile.<br /><br />Things start to pick up again with \\"Drain You\\", a song that, without its Whole Lotta Love-esque breakdown, becomes forgettable in short order despite being so poppy. The trio of songs that close the album (\\"Stay Away\\", \\"On a Plain\\", and \\"Something In The Way\\") range from good to great in respective order, with the simplicity of the latter painting a great picture about the homeless lifestyle.<br /><br />So why do I say Nevermind was somewhere in the middle of being good and being great? Well, I honestly believe the music hasn't aged as well as say, Pearl Jam, or Soundgarden, who continued to evolve through the years while creating music that still sounds great when mixed in with newer tunes. Nevermind is a really good album, but coupled with the fact that it sounds dated and can wear on the listener about half-way through, it loses some of the power it had back in 1991.
B000Y9PILI|2.0|I just purchased the Graham Nash Songs For Beginners cd/dvd-a set.  I'm having an issue with the dvd-a.<br /><br />In my Pioneer DV-578A universal player, which has dvd-a capability, when I insert the disc the menu comes up fine. However, when I select play the machine freezes up, to the point that the only thing i can do is unplug the player to unfreeze it. This is repeatable.<br /><br />The dvd plays fine in my regular non dvd-a dvd player, also a Pioneer. The universal player has never before had a problem with dvd-a. I also just checked it with another dvd-a, which plays fine. Does any one have any idea what's going on? Has anyone else experienced this?<br /><br />Edit: I've finally figured out that the Pioneer 578-a has a bug where it has trouble with all hybrid dvd-a discs. It plays straight dvd-a's fine, but with hybrids (depending on the firmware) it either locks up or only plays the dvd video audio track. Not the disc's fault.<br /><br />Edit #2: I recently found an unofficial firmware update for my player on line which kind of solves this problem. I say kind of, because I still have to press an odd sequence of buttons on the remote for it to play. If anyone reading this has a 578, you may want to search for this firmware.<br />____________________________________________________________________<br />Here's my thoughts on the cd:<br /><br />I am really disappointed in the new mix. As the album is under 34 minutes, I think it's a travesty that Nash didn't put both mixes on the cd, or even the old mix on the cd & the new mix on the dvd. I believe my dislike is partly because of 30+ years of listening to the old mix, but also that this mix harms the music. The gated drums are a joke in this context; they'd be at home with Billy Idol, & the multiple previously inaudible mistakes are a huge distraction for me.<br /><br />Here's a few specific comments:<br /><br />1. Regarding several comments here & elsewhere that the drums sound re-recorded or sampled: I have some studio experience. What I heard on Better Days & several others was likely the original drums, but with a very loud & prominent gated reverb added that was not on the original mix. The drums were also mixed louder then in the original. I have no clue WHY Nash made that choice; imo it harms the songs.<br /><br />2. I get the impression that Nash decided he wanted every tiny part that was sitting anywhere on the multi track masters to be clearly audible, even at the expense of the song as a whole.<br /><br />3. I never noticed before that the acoustic guitar on Be Yourself is slightly out of tune. There are also some wrong bass notes on the piano that I never heard before on the 1st verse. I heard numerous muffed parts throughout the cd which I've never noticed before; I suspect they were intentionally buried in the original mix.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep my original cd. I haven't yet decided if I'm going to keep this. The mastering is tremendous, but so far I'm not fond of this mix. It sounds like a totally different album, & some of the parts don't fit; little mistakes that were previously buried are now loud & clear, especially on the drums.hers was likely the original drums, but with a very loud & prominent gated reverb added that was not on the original mix.

B001AKTZOG|4.0|With Concord Music Group having purchased the Fantasy catalog, the fortieth anniversary of Creedence Clearwater Revival's debut LP provides a suitable opportunity for a fresh round of reissues. All six of the original foursome's albums (from 1968's Creedence Clearwater Revival through 1970's Pendulum) have been struck from new digital masters and augmented by previously unreleased tracks. Those who purchased the 2001 box set can pick up most of the bonus tracks separately as digital downloads (the two longest bonuses are CD-only). Those who didn't buy the box, and think they'll buy all six reissues may want to consider the box set for its inclusion of pre-Creedence work from the Blue Velvets and Golliwogs, the seventh CCR album Mardi Gras, the 1970-71 live recordings and several box-only bonuses. But for those just wanting to pick up a few favorite albums, these reissues are the ticket. Each is presented in a digipack with original front and back cover album art and a 16-page booklet with photos, credits and new liner notes.<br /><br />Creedence's sixth studio album in 2-1/2 years, Pendulum, marked their finale as a four-piece; two months after its December 1970 release, rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty would quit the group for good. Unlike the summary of their musical inventions heard on 1969's Cosmo's Factory, their latest LP found John Fogerty pushing the group in new directions, including more blatant nodes to New Orleans funk, Stax soul, and experimental studio productions. The album's press - both at the time and with this reissue - suggested the new focus was partly motivated by the dismissive attitudes of the band's peers. With a string of top-5 singles and a lack of trendy sounds on their albums, Creedence wasn't always given their due as innovators. Fogerty may have felt stung, but instead of capitulating with nods to current trends, he sought to lead the band in new directions. Fogerty may well have felt restless after stringing together Bayou Country, Green River, Willy and the Poorboys, and Cosmo's Factory in just 18 months. Fogerty wrote all of the album's songs for the first time, employed sax solos and a vocal backing chorus and, most conspicuously, added generous helpings of Hammond B-3.<br /><br />Given all those changes, the album opens with a characteristic heavy rock jam that would have fit the group's debut. The organ lining the album's single, \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain,\\" portends the larger changes to be found within the album, and those innovations first kick in with the organ, saxophone and chorus backing of \\"Sailor's Lament.\\" Fogerty's keyboard provides a spooky introduction to \\"(Wish I Could) Hideaway,\\" offering melodramatics that harken back to the group's earlier cover of \\"I Put a Spell on You.\\" Fogerty's fascination with Stax turns blatant on the funky \\"Chameleon,\\" and the structure and riff of \\"Born to Move\\" provide a solid nod to Rufus Thomas' \\"Walking the Dog.\\"<br /><br />As a producer Fogerty gives his rhythm section its due on \\"It's Just a Thought,\\" moving the bass and drums forward and rewarding listeners with some of Stu Cook and Doug Clifford's terrifically melodic playing. The album closes with the Little Richard styled rocker, \\"Molina,\\" and the six-minute prog-rock experiment \\"Rude Awakening, No. 2.\\" The latter provides a \\"heavy\\" bookend to the album's opener, but aside from the acoustic guitar intro, it's rather tortuous. Closing track pretentions aside, this is a solid album whose new directions may not measure up to the group's peak, but might have proved fruitful had the group not dissolved with 1972's Mardi Gras. Bonus tracks on the 2008 CD reissue include the promotional single \\"45 Revolutions Per Minute (Part 1 and 2),\\" which finds the band experimenting in the studio with a \\"Revolution #9\\" like montage of production tricks, backwards tape, sound effects, musical bridges, comedy bits, and San Francisco DJ Tom Campbell. Wrapping up the disc is a live take of \\"Hey Tonight\\" recorded by the three-piece Creedence in Hamburg on their last tour of Europe.

0765342294|4.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is definitely not your typical science fiction novel.  At first glance, I was reluctant to read it, \\"Oh boy, another version of Star Trek or Star Wars with a cheesy plot.\\"  I was wrong with Ender's Game!  Although the book includes science fiction entities, it goes beyond them.  What lies beneath is a book with a story filled with foreshadowing and twists and turns.    The plot of Ender's Game is filled with many climaxes and incidents.  As we follow a young boy that is definitely not like the rest through Battle School, we experience the high points and low points of his life.  This young boy, Ender Wiggin becomes the outcast of his peers due to his intelligence.  \\"Ender noted quietly that this was the first time another Launchy from his own class had sat with him at a meal.\\" (P.56). Ender is constantly caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and his unintentional antics result in him becoming the loner of his launchy group.  As we watch Ender develop through his trials and tribulations of Battle School, it is quickly determined by the many that he will be the one capable of saving the human race from the aliens.  Will Ender be able to live up to his potential while trying to live a typical life at school?  You will have to see for yourself.    Ender's life at Battle School demonstrates his excellent abilities and potential.  He immediately becomes the favorite of the teachers.  This creates many enemies for Ender.  In what becomes a good v. evil battle, Ender is forced to make decisions he may later regret.  \\"You took him apart.  I thought you were dead meat, the way he grabbed you.  But you took him apart.  If he'd stood up longer, you would have killed him.\\" (P. 232)    The most intriguing aspect of Ender's Game is the foreshadowing.  Each cadet at Battle School is constantly monitored by the teachers.  Each decision and move they make can be scrutinized or praised by the teachers.  If they do not meet the standards of the teachers, they can be sent home immediately.  This is especially challenging for Ender.  Every game he plays, his loneliness, his decisions are all observed.  Even more so because the teachers believe Ender is the chosen one.  He must be prepared to beat the aliens and save the human race.  \\"But going for the open eye - like that - this is the one we want to put in command of our fleets? (P. 171)    Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a must read for anyone looking for some unexpected twists thrown into a science fiction theme.  You are drawn into the main character, Ender within the first few pages.  You personally experience Ender's ups and downs at Battle School.  As Ender becomes the chosen one to save the human race from the aliens, will he rise to the occasion or will he crumble under the pressure?  The lives of the human race are at stake and you can see the outcome by reading this book!

Each is presented in a digipack with original front and back cover album art and a 16-page booklet with photos, credits and new liner notes.<br /><br />By the time Creedence recorded their second album, Bayou Country, John Fogerty had fully merged his broad range of Americana music influences into a wholly new sound. The El Cerrito, California bred songwriter re-imagined himself as a bayou musician whose guitar rock crawled from the swamp laden with backwoods blues and country twang. Fogerty debuts his persona on the album's opener, with reverbed guitar bending over, around and through the group's brilliant rhythm section. It's a perfect bookend to the album's closer, \\"Keep on Chooglin',\\" whose title and rhythm define the underpinnings of the band's musical vocabulary. In between Fogerty crafted the lasting myth of \\"Proud Mary,\\" fusing the group's newly born shuffle, the soul of Stax and fictionalized images of Mississippi riverboats.<br /><br />The band plays spare, late-night blues on \\"Graveyard Train,\\" but the images of lonely rural highways, railroads and undertakers all return to the album's bayou hoodoo. The lone cover is a version of Little Richard's \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" that finds Fogerty tearing up his overdriven lead guitar. The 2008 CD's bonus tracks open with an alternate take of the shuffling \\"Bootleg\\" that's stretched to double the original three minutes with a scat vocal section added to the middle.

B000002JSP|4.0|Hey! I love \\"Hot Dog.\\" It is a fun song. Sometimes all a good song needs to be is fun. I'm sure that was what they were thinking. And Zep never padded the albums with filler. As far as the rest goes...the times were changing and so were Jimmy and company. I'll meet you half way and say a three star for a Zep album and a four star to anything else released by another artist that year. Final thought: Jimmy was out of it and every band needs to evolve and try something different. I will never forget the weird water color album sleeve. What was that all about?
B001AKTZPK|5.0|With Concord Music Group having purchased the Fantasy catalog, the fortieth anniversary of Creedence Clearwater Revival's debut LP provides a suitable opportunity for a fresh round of reissues. All six of the original foursome's albums (from 1968's Creedence Clearwater Revival through 1970's Pendulum) have been struck from new digital masters and augmented by previously unreleased tracks. Those who purchased the 2001 box set can pick up most of the bonus tracks separately as digital downloads (the two longest bonuses are CD-only). Those who didn't buy the box, and think they'll buy all six reissues may want to consider the box set for its inclusion of pre-Creedence work from the Blue Velvets and Golliwogs, the seventh CCR album Mardi Gras, the 1970-71 live recordings and several box-only bonuses. But for those just wanting to pick up a few favorite albums, these reissues are the ticket. Each is presented in a digipack with original front and back cover album art and a 16-page booklet with photos, credits and new liner notes.<br /><br />Creedence's fourth album, their third full album for 1969, Willy & The Poor Boys, was even more of a classic than the preceding Green River. The band sounds even more at home with their sound and Fogerty's creativity was stoked by the blistering pace at which he was creating new material. One could be forgiving of a few album tracks that didn't measure up, but there weren't any. Fogerty's pen was overflowing with quality tunes and the band's covers of \\"Cotton Fields\\" and \\"The Midnight Special\\" are so thoroughly inscribed with the Creedence sound as to be their own. Even the instrumental confection \\"Poorboy Shuffle,\\" with its wheezing harmonica and washboard skiffle, fits tightly into the album's sequence, providing a light introduction and crossfade to the Ike Turner styled \\"Feelin' Blue.\\"<br /><br />The darkness of Green River is mostly dispelled here, as \\"Down on the Corner\\" opens the album with a joyous shuffle that coasts on Creedence's potent rhythm section, and the paranoia of \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" is played for rural laughs. Fogerty's not without his calluses though, and \\"Fortunate Son\\" opens with a low, throbbing bass and memorable guitar riff to accompany the blistering attack on masters of war and privileged souls who get others to fight their wars. The 2008 CD's bonus tracks include live versions of \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" recorded by the three-piece Creedence on their 1971 European tour. The former is sung at a breakneck tempo that doesn't seethe as fully as the studio original, the latter, recorded in Berlin, features the same hot guitar mix as other tracks from this show. Closing the CD is a version of \\"Down on the Corner\\" recorded with Booker T. and the MGs. The mono audio of this last bonus is less than sparkling, but where else are you going to hear John Fogerty and Steve Cropper swapping guitar licks?

The author doesn't explain what he did to resolve issues in his own life and does not explain how you can do it in yours.

The result sums up the band's evolution with socially-charged guitar jams (\\"Ramble Tamble\\"), concise, iconic hit singles (\\"Travelin' Band,\\" \\"Up Around the Bend\\" and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\"), memorable B-sides (\\"Who'll Stop the Rain,\\" \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" and \\"Long As I Can See the Light\\"), heartfelt throwbacks (\\"Before You Accuse Me,\\" \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"My Baby Left Me\\"), and a tour de force eleven minute reworking of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine.\\" Rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty would stick around for the next LP (Pendulum), but this one's actually the more fitting summation of the original foursome's 2-1/2 year run.  John Fogerty might well have sensed this was the high point as he sings \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" weary but satisfied, and \\"Long As I Can See the Light\\" as an elegy.<br /><br />Given that all three B-sides should have marked their own time on the charts, one can easily imagine this album spinning off six hits, with the lengthy album tracks tucked away on the late night radio waves of underground FM. Legacy's 2008 CD reissue adds three bonus tracks, including a post-LP studio take of \\"Travelin' Band\\" recorded without horns, a previously unreleased live version of \\"Up Around the Bend\\" from the group's final European tour and a 1970 studio jam of \\"Born on the Bayou\\" featuring Booker T. on organ.

Each is presented in a digipack with original front and back cover album art and a 16-page booklet with photos, credits and new liner notes.<br /><br />Creedence's third album (their second for 1969), Green River, is their first completely original effort as a band. Gone are the lengthy San Francisco jams, replaced by concisely written and arranged songs that concentrate Fogerty's evocations of an idealized South. The album opens with the title track's sumptuous memory of a mythical childhood, a song so deeply soaked in Southern swamps that it's hard to imagine it being written in the urban hills of California's Bay Area. The Fogerty brothers intertwine their twangy electric guitars with familial telepathy. The sound first explored on Bayou Country is now heard on every cut, mellowing the blue \\"Tombstone Shadow\\" and providing an introspective stage for Fogerty's ballads. Even the frantic \\"Commotion\\" is given a Cajun base for its lyrics of a country boy demolished by the city's hyperactivity. Fogerty's social conscience stretches biblical allusions to then present day situations on \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone,\\" and with \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" the visions turn catastrophic. There's a great deal more darkness here than on any other Creedence LP.<br /><br />Fogerty's guitar could be sinewy or ring with the influences of Chet Atkins, as does his solo on \\"Cross-Tie Walker.\\" Country music also makes an impact on the sorrowful, highly personal lyric of \\"Lodi.\\" The album closes with its sole cover, a slow rockabilly take on Ray Charles' blue-soul \\"The Night Time is the Right Time.\\" The 2008 CD's bonus tracks include a pair of pre-LP backing tracks that were never completed, the country-shuffle \\"Broken Spoke Shuffle\\" and the twangy \\"Glory Be.\\" Also here is a trio of live tracks from the group's 1971 European tour. \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" is rushed (as are so many songs played live), a medley of \\"Green River\\" and \\"Suzie Q\\" is condensed to four-and-a-half-minutes, pointing out the two songs' similarities more than giving the latter its full due, and \\"Lodi\\" is a fittingly weary lyric for a band reduced to three of its original four members.

006135323X|3.0|Blame Malcolm Gladwell - but after [[ASIN:0141014598 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] social psychologists of the type he featured in that book have been coming out of the woodwork to publish in the pop science market in alarming numbers figuring, reasonably enough, that there's a bit of money to be made on the side. I'm guessing royalties from articles in the International Journal of Psychology would pale in comparison.<br /><br />One of the latest is Dan Ariely, whose unique selling point is a horrific accident he sustained as a student Israel which left him with burns to 70% of his body. His book does what it says on the tin, by way of explaining a number of social experiments that he and his colleagues have run in the last few years, loosely themed around the observation that we don't always act as sensibly as logic would dictate.<br /><br />Which is fine - as you would expect, some of the examples are eyebrow raising - but it really shouldn't be news and it certainly doesn't require Dan Ariely to tell us that our liberal western societies aren't as rational as we like to think (incontrovertible proof of that, not offered in Ariel's book, being the politicians we elect and the amount of attention and money we collectively devote to cosmetics, fashion, celebrity and professional sport), especially as deeper epistemological examination reveals the idea of \\"rationality\\" is incoherent anyway.<br /><br />But just as some anecdotes are enlightening, the implications of others are not nearly as plain or convincing as Ariel thinks they are, and some of his experiments struck me as being particularly glib, superficial and susceptible to plenty of alternative interpretations.<br /><br />And what Ariel's book lacks is any further theoretical drive: OK, so we are predisposed to behave in silly or odious ways - but what's your point? In what underlying way are our irrational proclivities linked? What conclusions can we draw; what can we learn; what strategies can we adopt to counteract the harmful effects of our fecklessness?<br /><br />Ariely implies, but doesn't say, that some sort of regulation is required to save us. But given that it is also our irrational proclivities by which we arrive at these politicians (and the political institutions through which they organise themselves) I'm not sure he leaves us any better off than when we started.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonharmful effects of our fecklessness?

Not many artists survived that decade, but Lauper's one-of-a-kind attitude, her colorful fashion sense, and powerful voice proved she was more than the flavor of the moment. Songs like She Bop, All Through the Night, Money Changes Everything, Time After Time, and Girls Just Wanna Have Fun just chase all my blues away, I highly recommend this gem, enjoy!

0152048049|5.0|The two main characters in the book have one thing in common, and that is they both don't like grown-ups (this despite one of the characters being a grown-up). In the book, the narrator's plane crashes in the middle of the desert, and he meets a little boy from another planet. In this particular universe, all the planets (including the little prince's) are inhabited by one person, except Earth (in which there are many people). The little prince's planet is so small, that the prince can go in a different time-zone just by moving his chair a little.     The little prince's planet has a rose which the prince loves a lot and takes care of by watering it. Now, the prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep, which he does, and a sheep comes to life in the prince's planet as if in a fantasy. The prince then wants to protect the rose from the sheep who would like to eat it, and the narrator draws a muzzle around the sheep's mouth, and that too becomes a reality in the prince's planet.      The best part of the book is when the little prince visits other planets like his, and meets their lone inhabitants, such as the king, the tippler, the businessman, the lamplighter and the geographer. The book starts out being a comedy but it becomes more emotional as it progresses until we reach the touching ending.

0375826726|4.0|The first novel of the Inheritance series Eragon, was released in 2003.  It quickly climbed to the best seller list as an easy to read yet interesting fantasy novel.  Unfortunately for the Inheritance trilogy the second novel Eldest was not as spectacular as it read as a remake of Star Wars.  Surprisingly Brisingr is an excellent book that is not only original, but better crafted then the other two.      Paolini's writing is stronger, his character's are more interesting, and the book is far more original then its predecessors.  Brisingr's 750 pages fly by as creative and entertaining; as well as the best thing to ever happen the Inheritance cycle.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is one of the most well done documentaries/dramas I have ever seen.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00005AQF7|5.0|God damn it, it's just beyond my belief as to how someone who can drop a straight classic from top to bottom like this here, can then later became so terrible. Okay, so comparing everything else his done to this might be a bit harsh but he changed his style completely after Deathrow Records. Its one hell of a shame considering how talented he can be, proven by albums like this.  There is seriously, absolutely no disappointments on this album to speak of. Every track, even the ones that don't seem to have much Snoop at all are \\"at least\\" excellent by my book. The production, could actually be even better than the Chronic, nuff said there. Snoop brings to the table, his incredibly unique rapping style, with his amazingly laid-back flow/delivery which definitely is excellent with his ability to tell either \\"partying\\", \\"Chilled out\\" or hard-hitting, serious tales. Undoubtedly tracks like \\"Gin and Juice\\", \\"Murder Was The Case\\", \\"What's My Name\\" \\"Ain't No Fun\\" and \\"Doggy Dogg World are among the top hip hop songs of all time, all being highly classic. Though my personal favourite I'd say would have to be \\"Tha Shiznit\\". I'll say that I generally hate skits, but the ones on here aren't half bad, I don't desperately have to skip through them like I usually have to with skits, plus the guest appearances like DPG did great as well, though no way can come close to outshining Snoop.   Truly an outstanding 5 star classic. Honestly this is enough for anyone to respect Snoop fully despite the garbage he's released later in his career.  An absolute must have or any sort of hip hop fan.

B0000039PW|5.0|Before I start a special comment. Stop this stupid beef crap. It would be a heck of a lot easier to simply accept that both Biggie and 2Pac are rap legends and enjoy their music equally, that sounds a heck of a lot better than carrying out a stupid beef that a lot of you probably don't truly know s**t about anyway.  It was albums like this, and Nas's Illmatic that really got the east coast going again. I would say this is easily a top 10 hip hop album of all time, every track Biggie shows off some unbelievable lyricism. He can be straight serious on \\"Things Done Changed\\" to sort of wittily serious on \\"Warning\\" to amazingly witty on \\"One More Chance\\" to even introspective on \\"Juicy\\" As a Rapper Biggie is certainly one of a kind, the way he puts words together and ability to create vivid pictures in your mind is truly mind blowing along with his legendary flow which is possibly the best ever. Production wise it was a huge success. It seems quite heavily \\"G-Funk\\" influenced, I guess mainly because a lot of the tracks are \\"laid-back\\" in theme, mostly, some are east coast sounding, regardless all that was a recipe for a classic. I find nearly every track to be superb especially the amazing Juicy, grimy story telling Gimme the Loot, the phenomenally lyrical Unbelievable, and plenty more.  I'll say that I would definitely get this over Life After Death, but whatever, once you get this you'll love it, trust me.

B000TGJ80S|5.0|Dracula is a great movie.  Gary Oldman is both creepy and seductive.  A host of other actors are in this movie--Keanu Reeves, Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder and Billy Campbell.  This movie sticks closely to the book, which is another reason why I liked it so.
0143038583|5.0|I went into this book with the expectation it would shove a bunch of ideals down my throat, and try to turn me into a vegan. This couldn't be further from the truth. From the very start of The Omnivore's Dilemma, Michael Pollan simply presents the facts (and his own experiences) and leaves the rest up to you. But even more, he does this with clear, compelling, intelligent writing that truly opens your eyes and makes even the most mundane science about corn more interesting than you could ever imagine. His conclusions are interspersed with fascinating stories about his experiences at farms throughout the country. And his facts are clearly presented and supported by reliable sources and impressive research. No matter how you look at food (or even if you don't, as I hadn't), this book will keep you intrigued and get you thinking about your eating habits. If you leave the book wanting more concrete advice for what to eat (or what not to), check out Pollan's next book, In Defense of Food, (another great read).
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I received \\"Remember That Night\\" yesterday and sat and watched the entire concert tonight...a great addition to my Pink Floyd collection.    The clarity in the music and HD filming is extraordinary.  The musicians that put the whole thing together make it an all time great.  It will become the #1 concert on HD DVD of all time without a doubt.    This final recorded performance that Richard Wright performed in makes it an honor to own.      God Bless you Mr. Wright and your family.  Your music and peaceful demeanor will be remembered by all Pink Floyd fans forever.
0385340990|5.0|This is a really marvelous book.  But before you read it, look at a map, and see where the Channel Islands are in relation to France (occupied by the Germans 1941 to 1945) and England.  And then get into this book - just letters, diaries, journal entries, but still enthralling.  A reviewer thought the second half weeker - absolutely not.  With the absolutely most delightful proposal of marriage at the end.  No, I don't read \\"women's books\\" or romances (not if I can help it), history & science & science fiction and fantasy is more my style, but this one was interesting from the start and more and more enthralling as it continued.
B001DELWZY|5.0|This new DVD from Arthaus faces formidible competition from Gheorghiu's first Violetta on Decca; this was her \\"double\\" debut, both on DVD and CD. It was her first undertaking of the role and clearly she meant to make it her own. The conductor, Solti, allows for the second verses to arias that are either frequently cut (O mio rimorso and Addio del passato) and includes the cabaletta to Di provenza--not one of Verdi's most inspired moments.    This new DVD uses sets that were new in 1990 although I don't think anyone could lodge a complaint in this area: they are opulent, plush and quite gorgeous. The conservative opera goer will have no complaint here. If memory serves me correctly this is the same production that featured Tiziana Fabriccini, an interpretation that was very controversial, Roberto Alagna and Paolo Coni and conducted by Muti. It should be re-released by whoever has the licensing rights.     Gheorghiu matches all the excellences of her earlier performance. She always looks stunning, sings beautifully and is an accomplished actress. I can't think of any other singer who has this role in her repertoire could match this diva. Yes, it's true that she doesn't take the optional high D at the end of the first act aria, but that's what it is: an option. Her performance is nuanced and touching. I have heard some of Fleming's performance but I find her superficial and dramatically utterly uninvolved. (A downside to the LOs Angeles DVD is Bruson who in his prime was a baritone to be reckoned with; here, at 70 (!) his tone is partched and is afflicted with a wobble which is very distressing.)    Vargas is a great improvement over Lopardo who is somewhat wooden and appears uncomfortable. The former would never be accused of being a great actor but his instincts are always right and while not being \\"handsome\\" he has a cherubic sweetness that is very engaging. He has clearly thought out the requirements of the music and brings a great deal of imagination. A pity thatthe second verse of O mio rimorso was cut as it spoils the musical balance that Verdi was aiming for. (Gheorghiu was also denied her second verse in the Addio del passato.)    Frontali is a vast improvement over Nucci who by rights should be able to shine in this role; the latter became a \\"Verdi baritone\\" by default. His milieu is clearly in the Donizetti/Bellini/Rossini operas. the voice is slender, but well focused, but I prefer Fontali's bigger more rugged sound. Of course he has no competition--at least none that I know of on the horizon.     Initially I had my doubts about Maazel. In the 70's (I am hazarding a guess)he recorded Traviata with Lorengar, Aragall and DFD. It was a near complete text if I recall, but Decca management doubtless came down with the mandate to get it on two LP discs. As a result the tempi were brutal in many cases and even though the set did garner some good reviews I have no doubt that it was due to Lorengar. Here Maazel seems much more relaxed and at one with the score. In short one of the best performances of Traviata that I have heard.     For those who want or require a regie Traviata stay away. There is no Konzept here. I would dearly love to see the Venice performance (again Maazel I believe) and even though what I have seen of Villazon/Netrebko is more than offputting (more due to Rizzi who seems to be this generation's Molinari-Pradelli). The cover on the Bel Aire DVD is a Maryln Monroe 'manque\\"--not the association I make with Traviata. OTOH if a conventionally staged, directed production of this opera is what you want I can only recommend  this new set.
B0018KW3XS|5.0|There are very few artistic accomplishments in the 20th Century to compare to the creation of the Cuban National Ballet from its beginnings to one of greatest ballet companies in the world. In Cuba, ballet is almost as popular as the national sport(baseball, followed by boxing and soccer), a situation not easily found anywhere else. All this is due to the tireless efforts of Alicia Alonso and her friends.  This performance of Don Quixote is one of the best available on DVD. It is also the first DVD we have of the Cuban National Ballet in the 21st Century. We have many examples of Cuban ballet stars dancing with other companies, like the ABT and the Royal Ballet, but not the entire company. The ballet world can only wonder where the Cuban magic comes from. Perhaps it is something in the water!  This performance, done in Paris in 2007, has fantastic choreography, artistry and technique. The costumes and sets are also beautiful. The camerawork, sound, and image are all up to the highest standards. The only thing it lacks, is the presence of the Orchestra of the Great Theatre of Havana. They recorded the music before they left for Paris. They used this pre-recorded music for the performance. Obviously, this was done to save money, since dragging the entire orchestra with them would have probably cost more than the expense for the rest of the entire ballet! The Cuban National Ballet is not exactly flush with cash. We should be glad we can see them at all.  The version of DonQ as performed here was especially created by Alicia Alonso and is a very convincing version, indeed. Choreographically modern and stimulating, it is perhaps also more faithful to the story as conceived by Cervantes. A great bonus feature is included which includes extensive interviews(in Spanish with English or French subtitles) with Alicia Alonso and the principal dancers. A wide variety of interesting topics are discussed, such as the formation of the Cuban ballet, and the basic philosophy that ispart of their art and technique. Scenes of rehearsals of this and other performances are also shown. Lovers of classical ballet should try to add this to their collection. For further exploration into Cuban ballet, you might consider reading the recent biography of Carlos Acosta, \\"No Way Home...\\", as well as the biographies of Alicia Alonso.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|Considering she widdled down this cd from 40 tracks to 13, it makes me wonder what those other songs sound like.  And why put on \\"And I'm Telling You\\" which was already released???  What up with that?  She could of at least put on the club dance remix instead of the Dreamgirls version!   There are like 5 tracks i like off the entire cd.  I absolutely love \\"Spotlight\\".  It's a classic r and b song that will sound good forever.  \\"If It Isn't Love\\" is a good song.  It sounds borderline alternative with that new crossover sound but remains r and b in flavour.  \\"My Heart\\" is a good mid tempo sounding groove.  I do like the gospel song \\"Jesus has A Place For Me Over There\\", but I'm not crazy over any of the other ballads.  In my oppinion, all of the other slow songs are what ruin the album for me.  I don't like how jennifer Hudson disguises the song \\"We Gon Fight\\" as an inspirational, cutesy empowerment song when actually if you listen to the lyrics, it's a pro-war song and advocates violence.  I'm sorry I'm not a \\"war\\" person so I don't like the message of the song.  I like Culture Club's \\"The War Song\\" where it goes \\"war war is stupid, and people are stupid....\\"  Now that's a good message but i guess were not living in that kind of world anymore.  The song \\"I Can't Stop The rain\\" is a bizarre song about some horrible car crash, talking about how a car flips over 3 times and I wish you would have died instead of her?  What??  It's moments like this on the cd that put off the listener.  There is no flow to the whole thing.  It's another one of those mixed bag offerings where the artist is covering many creative grounds and trying to prove themselves.  I like Jennifer Hudson in spite of it all.  I think she has a genuine personality, and I like the fact she tries to appeal to a wide audience, especially her gay fans.  She has alot more in her and this is a good first effort.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|When i ordered \\"live at rockpalast\\",I thought it was a cd.Iwas looking for the song \\"asking Around For You\\".I knew it was a live album,and this was at the top of the list.Anyway i was surprised but happy when i got the dvd.If you like to listen to joe play a guitar,you're gonna love watching him.    There is joe,his base player,and his drummer,and through the whole album,I kept looking for the rest of the band.After watching it 3 or 4 times,i found some of the solos and endings to gone on a bit.but are still great to watch.    we've certainly enjoyed it,and if there is another one out there,or one coming,I'll be looking for it.         john

B00007AJGH|5.0|This is a very inventive, technically brilliant cartoon. It has a lot of incredibly funny scenes and a great many superb comic in jokes.<br /><br />For the time this was made, the special effects are stunning. This is a great piece of entertainment.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
B001DWNUCO|2.0|This movie is an attempt to make a film with respected actors and high production values that also contains scenes of hard core sex where NOTHING is left to the imagination.Just a warning to those who might accidentally buy it who would be offended.The film itself is rather boring.What popularity it DOES enjoy is pretty much due to the novelty of a \\"high quality\\"porn flick,and the fact that as an unrated film you can get it from outlets that would not carry X or NC-17 films.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|This is Tarantino's weakest film.<br /><br />A lot of this is taken up with pointless, meandering dialogue - way below his usual standard.<br /><br />Some of the action is incredibly well filmed, but overall this disappoints.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
B0019EXZYE|4.0|A pretty good movie with some decent acting.  Saffron plays a straight laced British lady with a double (or is it triple) side. It's amazing that the story is even true.  Regardless, definitely worth a see.
B0015FML06|3.0|I am disappointed that after all this remastering they couldn't at least give us the entire live show for \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\".  Are we to believe that U2 only performed 8 songs at Red Rocks?  Come on, give us the audio of the full show.    Now, remaster \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" for a two-disc set, please!
B001DDBCUU|4.0|I honestly believe that if you loved the series you will love or at least really like this movie..if you were on the fence about the series or came to it late and sorta didnt get that into it, you probably will find this film a bit long and laborious and will want to throttle the title characters, especially our crazy fu**ed up Carrie.  I for one love the series and thus loved this movie, yes it has it's flaws, it's sorta meandering and i wanted at times to jump into the screen to smack some of the characters, but overall, it was very true to the series.  For me, it was just great to see the characters back, and watch them once again navigate the NYC scene.  The fashion is back and SJP is still struting in here Manolo's and wearing the most bizarre things.  I wont go on and on about the story, because if you love the series you're going to see this anyway, and frankly if you're not into the series you're not going to get into this movie, it's as simple as that.  I for one, can't wait for the next movie..but then again, I love these women...flaws and all.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I just bought this cd yesterday afternoon after hearing \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" on Metallica's myspace page. I found that in hearing that, I heard a glimpse of Metallica's original style within the song. That gave me hope that the rest of the album would be better than the last album. I'm a big Metallica fan just like the rest of you and love almost every single song that they had ever came out with before hand, until St. Anger. I just couldn't feel that album at all. They completely just whisked away their original sound, and the album just came off as amateurish.    I read reviews for Death Magnetic and listened to samples on amazon, and found that the tracks were ok at first. To be honest I bought the album on impulse for the day that never comes, but after sitting in front of security cameras on an 8 hour day and listening to this album over and over at least ten times. I can say that this is a big improvement from St. Anger and that every single song is good.     You gotta give this album more than a couple times to really soak it up. Once you get passed the initial awkwardness of the sound, you start to really enjoy the tracks. The song \\"Cyanide\\" you can hear pieces of \\"Seek and Destroy\\". Other tracks you can hear samples of \\"One\\", \\"Four Horsemen\\" etc. The only little problem I have with the album is the over baring bangs that occasionally sound the same on a lot of the tracks by Lars, and in away goes over the sounds of the other instruments, just like in St. Anger. The other is that the lyrics aren't all that great. Hetfield sings it right. There good, but not that great. I'm starting to not mind it so much though. I'm really happy that they have Kirk Hammet back with the solos, everyone back on key, together again is what made Metallica, the band as a whole, and this is why I feel my money was well worth spent on this awesome album! Put this in your car stereo, pop it on random, turn up the volume, and let it rip!

B00005RDRO|5.0|If you're a fan of detective spoofs and whodunit mysteries, Murder By Death is a must-see as the film that inspired the private-eye parodies that followed it.  Filled with slapstick, double entendre, dry witticisms, and sight gags, this movie has something for everyone, especially those who can appreciate all of the above.  It features an all-star cast, including Peter Sellers (The Pink Panther), Maggie Smith (Harry Potter), and a hilarious Peter Falk (Columbo).
031606792X|4.0|Why don't we all extend our capacity for literary complexity a little bit and consider the possibility that a books \\"message\\" (or lack there of, or the wrong one, which seems to be what all the fuss is about) is not completely dependent on what happens to the characters.      Meyer's message is not in the outcome, where Bella ends up with everything she wants.  Rather, it is in the process, and more importantly, the sacrifices she is PREPARED to make in order to either procure happiness or protect the interests of those she deems more important than herself.  For example, Bella ends up with Jacob and Nessie at the conclusion of the novel; however, it is more important that she was willing to sacrifice her relationship with them (and in doing so, sacrificing her own life) in order to ensure that they survive the confrontation with the Volturi and that they end up together.  Or, as another example, she is prepared to be marked as the main target in battle if it means giving her side a better chance of survival and protecting those she loves.  Et-cetera, et-cetera.      In fact, I doubt anyone can argue that, while Bella's motivation to become immortal hinges on fulfilling her own happiness (though Meyer goes through great lengths to show that Edward and Bella's love is so supernaturally strong that it is hardly a choice at all), the tension in her decision to do so results from her pervasive instinct to protect those she cares about, namely Charlie.  Really, Bella's motivation for most all her actions stems from this same instinct to care for everyone else.  How often do we hear her say things to the effect of, \\"I should do x, but I might hurt y?\\"  Anyone who misses Meyer's overt characterization of Bella as selfless and humble to nearly a fault shouldn't be writing reviews anyway.      Yes, Bella gets pregnant, but she doesn't have sex until after she is married and doesn't plan on getting pregnant.  Moreover, her pregnancy is nothing if not a medium to show the strength motherhood bestows on a person.  Yes, Bella ends up with Edward, but she is prepared to accept a fate in which they both die in order to save her best friend and daughter.  Yes, she ends up with a sustainable relationship with her father in the end, but she was prepared to sacrifice it completely for the sake of his physical safety and a chance at eternity with the person she loves.  And yes, for God's sake, she has nice stuff and will never have to worry about money; someone should really burn Stephanie Meyer at the steak for having some fun by giving a future-seeing, mind-reading, endless-amount-of-time vampire family a little luck in the stock market.    No one wants their daughter to have kids at 18.  But, if my daughter chooses to get married, THEN have sex, and gets pregnant on accident because she thought it biologically impossible, I'll probably be ok with it as long as she is willing to risk everything she has to make sure my granddaughter will live on forever with her destined husband (as long as they send me Christmas cards).  Can any of you really criticize Bella's overly practical, logical thinking and deeply compassionate consideration for the safety and comfort of everyone who'll be affected by the consequences of her actions?  Ya - horrible message, Meyer.      Lighten up, look past the obvious, and go for the real message.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|Sorry, I did not see this movie.  It was a gift.The service was very good.Fast delivery and product was new as promised.
B001E95ZNI|5.0|Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen star as two talented town tamers in APPALOOSA.  The movie hit the big screen this weekend and I took one of my sons to the first showing early this afternoon.  We both had a good time, and my trust and confidence in the stars was well deserved.<br /><br />The movie is based on the novel written by bestselling author, Robert B. Parker.  Parker has been writing the adventures of Spenser, a private eye born in Laramie, Wyoming, for years, and Spenser is as rough and tumble as any gunfighter in the Old West.  Lately, the author has successfully dipped his quill into the Western arena.<br /><br />I read the book when it came out a few years ago and had a good time with it.  I enjoyed the camaraderie of the two heroes in the novel, and was pleased to see it reflected in the movie.  Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole, one of the most feared and respected lawmen in the Old West.  Viggo Mortensen stars as Everett Hitch, Cole's dedicated and deadly right hand man.<br /><br />The book creates a tight plot line with a lot of twists and turns.  When I read it, I saw how easily it could become a screenplay.  Parker writes lean, muscular prose.  Obviously Ed Harris saw the same thing because he negotiated the rights to star and direct in the film.<br /><br />APPALOOSA starts off with a bang.  Three of them, in fact.  Bragg, a powerful man in the small but growing town of Appaloosa, faces the town marshal and defends two of his men that raped and killed a man and his wife.  When the marshal doesn't take no for an answer, Bragg kills the marshal and his two deputies.<br /><br />Virgil and Everett arrive and Harris takes advantage of those couple moments to establish sweeping shots of the desolate countryside.  Harris stays primarily with the characters and the action, but there are a lot of opportunities to shoot the sweeping landscape.  The action takes place in Appaloosa, outside of town, in the hills and mountains, and in another small town with Mexican architecture.<br /><br />I loved the detailed Old West setting.  The bar and buildings look and feels well-researched.  The house Virgil is buying on the outside of town is incredibly small by today's standards, but Allie (Renee Zellweger) acts excited about having it built.<br /><br />Of all the characters in the movie, Zellweger - in my opinion - has the hardest time pulling off her role.  The character is complicated because she bounces between a sympathetic and naïve woman to a cold and calculating one.  This type of female character often shows up in Parker's work, so long-time fans won't be surprised to watch her in action.  However, Zellweger's performance actually softens the character from the book.<br /><br />Parker likes showing the dichotomy between the strong, silent male and one that can be twisted around a conniving woman's little finger.  Many of his characters have suffered through that in his novels.  That paradigm is understated and succinct in the movie, but it still works well.<br /><br />The author has also penned a sequel that came out this year, RESOLUTION.  He has one more planned that will tie up Virgil and Everett's saga.<br /><br />The film's action is compelling.  The movie and the actors keep a lot of balls in play.  The sound effects on the gunshots are especially well done.  Many viewers might not be able to tell it, but the gunshots sound like heavy thumps, from coarse black powder rather than the cleaner-burning cordite all of today's rounds are made with.<br /><br />There is a moment of brief nudity and the language is rough in a couple places, but not in any way that will be overly offensive.  I think APPALOOSA is a modern tribute to yesterday's Western movies in a lot of ways.  The heroes are brave and noble, but they're also flawed.  Harris and Mortensen play those iconic lawmen to the hilt with a hint of swagger and elegance by the bushelful.  If you're a Western fan, this is a movie you'll enjoy.  And if you haven't seen a Western in a while, this is one you don't want to miss.

B001DHXT1G|5.0|In this movie, Louis Leterrier successfuly incorporated elements from both the comics and the TV series. Ang Lee's movie, although pretty interesting, lacked the action present in this movie.  Ed Norton makes a very good Bruce Banner, and the fight scenes are a lot of fun. Pls, for the fans, the movie is full of cameos and easter eggs...  I was there during the premiere in France, and the director promised some nice bonuses in the Blu-Ray and DVD collector set.  I'd put this superheroe movie between the Dark Knight (first, Batman seems to be unbeatable these days...) and Iron Man.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Well, this album definetely left an imprint on me the after listening to it the first time. I am only fourteen, so, like another reviewer said, I am a new age Beatles fan. But there's nothing wrong with that, right? Right. These four men ultimetely changed music forever. Paul, George, John, and Ringo have changed the face of the planet as we know it.      My personal favorite tracks are 1-19, but the other eight are also just as great! I personally like \\"Ticket To Ride\\" the best, at the moment. Whenever I hear that opening guitar, it always puts a smile on my face! Heck, whenever I hear a Beatles song, I always have to sing along. They were SO GREAT!!! Buy this album.

0670019925|5.0|David Lodge's \\"Deaf Sentence\\" is a seriocomic novel about a man whose quality of life is steadily declining.  Desmond Bates, a former professor of linguistics, takes early retirement, mostly because of a hearing loss that began twenty years earlier.  He suffers from \\"high-frequency deafness...caused by accelerated loss of the hair cells in the inner ear....\\" Since there is no treatment for this condition, Desmond resorts to hearing aids, which prove to be inconvenient and, in some circumstances, useless. As he dourly observes, \\"deafness is a kind of pre-death, a drawn-out introduction to the long silence into which we will all eventually lapse.\\"<br /><br />Now in his sixties, Desmond's existence settles into a boring routine. His wife, Winifred (whom he calls Fred), on the other hand, is rejuvenated, partly as a result of the flourishing new interior design business that takes up most of her time. Adding to his gloomy disposition is Desmond's concern for his eighty-nine year old father, Harry, who lives alone in London. Not only is Desmond's father also going deaf, but there are alarming signs that he is no longer able to care for himself adequately. Unfortunately, Harry refuses when Desmond offers to hire someone to look in on him and lend a hand with household chores.<br /><br />\\"Deaf Sentence\\" is a deeply affecting novel that springs from the author's personal experience with high-frequency deafness. The book succeeds on many levels and is enhanced by Lodge's clever use of language, entertaining literary and cultural references, and vivid descriptive passages. One day, when Desmond is strolling across the campus where he used to teach, he encounters a horde of students pouring out of their classes. \\"I floated on their tide like a piece of academic wreckage,\\" he muses with a hint of self-mockery. The author elevates the mundane by poignantly exploring the ebb and flow of marital relationships, the physical and mental decline that accompanies aging, and the toll that illness and disability take on both the victim and his family. Lodge conveys his knowledge of all these themes subtly, sensitively, and with a healthy dose of bracing humor.<br /><br />Desmond is an engaging first-person narrator, who sometimes lapses into the third person, presumably to give himself a breather. Fred is a devoted and sympathetic spouse, but as the years go by, she is becoming more and more exasperated by her husband's habits, especially his increasing reliance on alcohol as an anesthetic. Desmond is beginning to feel like \\"a redundant appendage to the family, an unfortunate liability\\" who no longer commands the respect that he once took for granted. To complicate matters further, an attractive but unstable young student named Alex Loom threatens to upend Desmond's already shaky existence when she asks him to supervise her dissertation on \\"the stylistic analysis of suicide notes.\\" Should he risk getting involved with this possibly predatory female?<br /><br />The novel draws us in more and more as the suspense builds.  We wonder how Desmond and Fred will adjust to the shift in their respective roles; what Desmond will do when his father can no longer live alone; and whether or not Desmond will give in to the lovely Alex in order to salve his battered ego. Lodge's vivid characters soon become familiar acquaintances whom we get to know so well that it is difficult to part with them. In this touching, funny, and wise book, David Lodge deftly  and unsentimentally illuminates the challenges and frustrations that, sooner or later, everyone must face.disability take on both the victim and his family.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|The newest album fron Linkin Park titled \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" sure is a lot different than \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", but I still liked it. It is probably the weakest of their albums, but it does have some very good songs on here.    1. Wake - Just an intro, doesn't need a rating.    2. Given Up -  5/5. The one song on the album that sounds the most like their older music. Really good.    3. Leave Out All The Rest - 5/5. In my opinion, the second best song on the album.    4. Bleed It Out - 3/5. I never could get into this song that much. In my opinion, Mike Shinoda's parts in the song are the only good parts. Chester's parts are just ok.    5. Shadow of the Day 5/5. In my opinion, the best song on the album. I could listen to it over and over.    6. What I've Done - 4/5. Great song, but is a little old now.    7. Hands Held High - 1/5. The worst song from Linkin Park in my opinion. I always skip this one.    8. No More Sorrow - 5/5. Another great song on this album.    9. Valentines Day - 3/10. The only good part of this song is the second half. Not a huge fan of the first half.    10. In Between - 2.5/5. It's ok, but not great.    11. In Pieces 3.5/5 - Alright song.    12. The Little Things That Give You Away - 2/5. I wasn't crazy about this song either.    So overall, I give this album 4 stars.

B000002C2E|5.0|With a career now pushing towards the 50 year mark and a host of bonafide classic albums, how do you rate a CD by Bob Dylan?  Do you rank it against its period or against the whole body of his work?  It's difficult to just rate it as a single CD without taking in the context or his whole career or his \\"mystique\\".<br /><br />Comparing TIME OUT OF MIND to his early works to me is an apples to oranges equation.  He was a different person in 1965 from what he was in 1997.  The 97 version was coming off a period of low activity as well as a near fatal illness, where the early Dylan was basically taking on the world.  The defiance that marked his early work had changed here into defiance against age and death.  As such, this CD captures that feeling very successfully.  He followed this with two other fine releases, LOVE AND THEFT and MODERN TIMES, but this is the superior of that trio to my ears.<br /><br />Teaming again with producer Daniel Lanois who oversaw his comeback album OH MERCY, Dylan brings a strong set of dark songs that he matches to some very evocative backing music.  I would say that this is his strongest set since BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, which he released over 20 years before. The opener LOVE SICK sets the tone for the rest of the CD.  Over a choppy, slow crawl, Dylan ruminates on love in the twilight of life.  The Cd is full of great songs that follow pretty much in this vein.  My favorites are TRYIN' TO GET TO HEAVEN, NOT DARK YET, STANDING IN THE DOORWAY and the rockabilly flavored DIRT ROAD BLUES.  It ends with a 17-minute free associative dirge HIGHLANDS that acts as a perfect coda.<br /><br />Detractors might say that the album is one note, filled with depressing dirges, or might mention Dylan's admitingly blown out voice.  I feel the album plays as a consistent whole, with the grim tone perfectly underlining the artist's message.  Dylan's rough vocals also drive the point home.  Of course, I am a fan of Tom Wait's vocals, so take that for what it's worth.<br /><br />To me, TIME OUT OF MIND is a classic album, one of the jewels in Dylan's vast and esteemed catalog, and my admiration of it has grown in the over 10 years that I have owned and listened to it.  Just don't ask me to choose if it's a better album than HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED or BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.F MIND is a classic album, one of the jewels in Dylan's vast and esteemed catalog, and my admiration of it has grown in the over 10 years that I have owned and listened to it.

0312427646|5.0|A slim volume, this book has lingered in my memory since I first devoured it in London this spring. The subversive power of the written word has rarely been as fancifully and effectively communicated as in this tale of Queen Elizabeth stumbling across a portable library in the grounds of Buckingham Palace while in pursuit of an errant corgi. The monarch is transformed into an avid reader, flummoxing her subjects, her government ministers, her family and her courtiers. Bennett captures the \\"voice\\" of the queen herself, even as he deftly outlines the odd position of the constitutional monarchy in today's Britain. Just imagine what could happen if a symbolic head of state, condemned to an eternity of ribbon-cuttings and delivering ceremonial speeches scripted by others discovers literature and a life of ideas? Bennett does -- with aplomb. And his closing paragraphs will leave you gasping and laughing at once -- an admirable twist to this tale.<br />Recommended for all readers -- common and uncommon -- who believe in the importance of books. Click that \\"buy\\" button or head for the bookstore, pronto!

B000WCDI5K|3.0|October 5, 2008<br />First, let me be upfront, I am not the best music critic to evaluate the Killers for generational reasons but I am going to offer you, nevertheless<br />a bona fide and credible reason for purchasing their music. Although I go back to the days of listening to Bob Dylan covered by Leon Russell singing She Belongs To Me on vinyl, as a music critic I can recognize unusual talent and vocal and performance superiority when I see it no matter what genre or generation we are talking about. I saw Brandon Flowers on SNL tonight and I honestly enjoyed it immensely. He had the presence and the confidence that we held so dear in the front men of some pretty over the top classic bands. The music was of course the evolving punk synth category that apparently 30 somethings want back. Brandon's vocals were measured and top notch tonight even though my idea of punk was Elvis Costello transcending into Green Day as opposition. The tracks on this CD that I favor are Bourbon On The Shelf and Mr. Brightside. The evolution of this band sounds like a conundrum to me, threaded to Las Vegas and apparently attempting to further the punk contribution to fans. The focal point of my argument forwarded to younger listeners is purchasing their music is a win/win only. Brandon Flowers, who come to think of it, I have seen twice on SNL gave a very lasting and exceptional performance tonight on vocals and keyboards. I think for that reason and the other tracks I have heard, this is a very interesting and competent band<br /><br />Jay Adler, Music Critic

All I can say is you have to read it to understand how truly awesome it is. It was so good I couldnt put it down I read it in one day. My advice is to read it you wont be disappointed.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|If you're looking for a brighter, more detailed picture buy the Superbit DVD. I compared it to the Bluray which I rented.  The Blu-ray is MUCH darker and much more creepier which is what you want in a horror movie!!! With the extra darkness comes loss of detail however.  The contrast is much better though. I believe Coppola did not approve of the Superbit but did approve the Blu-ray.  I prefer the Blu-ray version.
068485743X|5.0|Mr Lukeman's advice is incredible in this age where all rules, mores and sexes are blended. After this book in which he defends classic methods, I felt good again about returning to Melville and Dostoevsky, not to mention one of my all time favorites, Conrad, for reading and observation of their techniques. Thank you Mr Lukeman for writing this book. I read it twice, then made notes. For aspiring writers, if you want to sell a book, first get this one; if you want to write for the internet, you would'nt be interested.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|To begin with, let me say that I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory's. I read my paperback copy so many times that pages almost fell out. But after watching this movie I almost started hating the novel. Yes I understand that Hollywood has many difficulties in translating book to film, but this was basically a failure. So many literary AND historical inaccuracies it was laughable.       The mother was shown as too sympathetic and the father extremely weak, Mary and Anne became enemies much too quickly, Mary was married too late, and Stafford?! They should never have brought him into the movie so early; it ruins his future relationships and role with Mary. A major dislike for me was Mary's great reluctance to leave the country for court-mainly this was bad because in the book she BEGAN at court-as well, her loving the King came up really suddenly, she sleeps with him twice and BOOM! \\"Anne, I love him,\\" a little fast even for this movie. And WHERE did William Carey go to?! Just \\"disappeared\\" and Mary starts leaning toward Stafford. Implausible, yet no one seemed to notice. But I felt pity for the character of Anne during her virtual rape by the King-that was NEVER even insinuated in by any historians. And George Boleyn, for a character with such a pivotal role in the story, he had very little screen time, though Jim Sturgess did a fine job.      Also, the basic premise of the story-two sisters' rivalry for a King's love and standing in court-is twisted by having Anne try to catch the King first, and getting him injured. Anne was shown as having an extraordinary amount of power over even her family, especially too much sway over her uncle. The debate over sending Queen Katherine away was cut too short, as was the furor over divorce. Showing Mary in the countryside and Anne in France would have also been nice touches.      I truly admired Katherine of Aragon's character-very regal and formidable and her quoted lines from the novel- and how the failed Henry Percy marriage was shown. Also, Mary's lying in and both sisters' birthing scenes were very adequately stifling and scary. This could definitely be shown as an \\"anti-teen pregnancy movie.\\" Anne's coronation was suitably gaudy and brought to film well as did the people's ill reception of her as queen. Another well-done accuracy was Jane Boleyn's betrayal; almost all sources agree she began the family's downfall. But when the King decided to forgo Mary completely just to have the HOPE of getting with Anne I became utterly disgusted with the movie and could barely finish it. This is saying a lot for me since Scarlett Johannsen and Natalie Portman are two of my favorite actresses.      So maybe the author approved of the novel being dissected and stripped apart by this movie's portrayal, I as a fan, truly dislike this movie adaptation. I was all set to enjoy and revel in seeing some of my favorite characters and storylines brought to life, but this time Hollywood failed me.

B0015519VS|5.0|Usher did an impressive job following up his 9x platinum, \\"Confessions\\" album. I'm sure it was definitely difficult attempting this. While some people may agree or disagree this is a very impressive follow-up. My only gripes about the album is the single choices. It seems they weren't probably planned since the album was rushed to coincide with \\"Love In This Club\\" taking off so fast. Single, \\"Moving Mountains\\" is very good but is way too dramatic and overlong. \\"Before I Met You\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album. I can't stop playing it.

0553381407|3.0|Reading this book will confirm what you already suspect about your parent's behavior if you have toxic parents. It will also confirm that many of your emotional habits, such as letting people walk all over you, or not standing up to others because you don't want to make them angry, are because of the way you grew up. This book may help you to redefine your relationship with your toxic parent if you are in a position of still desiring a relationship with that parent. The short coming of this book is that it lumps so many kinds of abuse into one book that you don't get a good feel for how to deal with the specific type(s) of abuse that you experienced. It also doesn't really give the reader any tools to move forward in their own life. Yes, it validates that you were abused, but it doesn't talk about how to move yourself forward in any aspect other than your relationship with your toxic parent. The one thing that I took from this book, and am very greatful for, is the realization that my aging and in poor health, but still miserable, angry, mean, and toxic parent  lived her life and made choices to get to where she is today, it isn't my fault she is miserable and mean (even though she would tell me otherwise). I am entitled to live my life, I don't have to feel sorry for her and try to make her feel better at my family's expense anymore. Basically, after reading this book and dealing with a nasty precipitating event, I have realized that I am not responsible for her problems, she is. So if you are in need of validation that your parent is toxic, read this book. However, if you are looking for a way to pull your life together because of childhood abuse, this isn't the book you are looking for.

B00028HBKM|4.0|The Passion of the Christ has got to be one of the most contraversial films I have ever seen since the beginning of my very existance on this planet!      WARNING SPOLIERS AHEAD!    It all starts out with Jesus (Jim Caviezel whom I give major credit to for playing the doomed Jesus Christ)in some garden with his followers, and while Jesus is talking with the Devil, Judas goes to the Jewish officials and turns Jesus over to them.  Jesus is arrested, not long after that, his mother Mary, tells his wife Mary Magdalene that her instint senses something wrong.      Later they find out that Jesus has been arrested, and the Jews are now surrounding Jesus, they yell at him for claiming that he was the son of God or the Messiah.  Then Judas starts feeling very guilty and even has the devil stocking him, the next day Judas hangs himself in shame.  Also that day the Jews turn Jesus over to the Romans, and they for some stupid reason choose to relase a sadistic, ugly, cycloptic murder over the gentil handsome Jesus.      Later on, Jesus is getting the crap beat out of him, then he's whipped so many times, then he has to carry his own cross on his back.  And the Roman solders are pretty drunk from what I could see.  Oh and it gets much more worst from here on, while Jesus is carrying his cross on his back, the Romans are whipping him even more, and he trips.  Then they order a common man to help him carry the cross.  At first he refuses, but then ends up feeling sorry for him in the end, just like a lot of other people.      Then Jesus is nailed to the cross and just sits up there asking God to forgive the Jews and the Romans for killing him, and just when he thinks that God has abadoned him, he dies.      SPOLIERS END HERE    I would like to say that watching this movie has made me feel very confused inside.  But there are some obvious things to point out though.      1.  When it came to Jesus getting tortured, of course I felt sorry for him, regardless of weither or not he wasjust a common man or the Son of God.  And you can see how hard it was for Mary his mother to see her son suffer, and how hard it was for her to lose him.  That could be said of anyone who has ever lost a child.  But let's put it to you this way, if you don't want to see Jesus Christ get tortured, then don't watch this film. When watching a typical film, I could probably only stand to see someone get torchered for a half an hour, but not two hours, espically if it's Jesus.  That poor guy didn't even shout a single insult at anyone, even when everyone chose the murder to be let go over him.    2.  It didn't just show Jesus getting tortured, it also showed flashbacks of him helping people and asking them to forgive and love their enemies.  I'm glad that Mel Gibson did put those flashbacks in there.      3. Now for the most contraverasial point I would like to bring up.  First off I don't think that anyone should just go pointing fingers at the Jews, it not only sounds anti-Semetic, but you also left out an important detail, that the Romans were the ones who ordered the execution of Jesus Christ.  Think about the time that this happeend, back then if anyone claimed to be the Son of God then yes he's very likely to die, it was as risky as Joan of Arc claiming that she could talk to God.  Plus don't forget that the Romans were in charge of Israel at the time this happened, and don't also forget that the Romans believed in many Gods, so they probably would have put Jesus to death anyways.      4. And not all the Jews were against Jesus either, most of his followers were Jewish, and I can only recall one of them that betrayed Jesus, that was Judas.  Paul may have looked like he betrayed Jesus, but in the end Jesus forgave him, because he knew that if Paul would have backed him up, then he too would have died.  And I don't think that Jesus wanted to put his followers in jepordy, otherwize, who would be left to preach Jesus's teachings?  Also Mary Jesus's mother was a Jew, and his so-called wife Mary Magdalene was a Jew, so were they against him?  I also saw that some of the Jews actually felt sorry for him when he was walking with his cross on his back.    5. One last important detail, Jesus was a Jew, so anyone who hates Jews probably hates Jesus too.      That's all I have to say, and with all that said and done, I have nothing else to say, except, if you want to watch a very powerful film like The Passion of the Christ then do so.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower tells the story of Charlie, an awkward and introspective high school freshman.  The book is comprised of a series of letters that Charlie writes to an unknown recipient, relating the news of his life, the friendships with a group of seniors, his complex relationship with his family and his bond with a teacher who believes Charlie is special.    This is a wonderful coming-of-age tale.  It's such a cliche to compare every tale of a misfit boy to The Catcher in the Rye, but Charlie's alienation and struggle to find himself are every bit as compelling as in the classic stories of troubled youth, like Catcher.  Chbosky's writing style is honest and straightforward.  Charlie's desires and inadequacies are palpable.  I highly recommend this intelligent and moving novel.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer Hudson is a power house singer but unfortunately her strength in belting out lyrics, note after note from her gut is so under-stated on this CD.  Don't get me wrong, it is Rhythm & Blues and mature in content, but it Jennifer Hudson is holding back, or was held back on many of the ballads.   Another observation, proven talents like Jennifer Hudson should not include rappers on their debut CD's.  I think Ludacrous has lots of baggage and negative image in the media, the same media that has pretty much crowned Jennifer Hudson a rising R&B starlet although I personally think she singlehandedly accomplished that feat.  Either way, the tracks are above average, no complain there, she is just not delivering with gut, breathy passion that I've seen her do in live performances.  The CD is not a disappointment for me because the tracks are for the most part original and meaningful.   I just hope Clive Davis and her entire management team find the right market niche for Jennifer Hudson her second time around,      THIS CD SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED HER 3 SINGLES (below)  THAT ARE MOST DEFINITELY CROWD PLEASERS AND SPIRIT MOVING!  But, I guess the record company did not want Jennifer Hudson to get too paid.  But, if you are interested and curious go to her fan website and download them!!!!!    LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME  STAND UP  TO LOVE SOMEBODY

8186336141|5.0|This book is truly a timeless classic.  I have been practicing yoga for almost six years, 1 to 4 times a day.  I have many good books and DVDs on yoga.  However, this book is THE most comprehensive.<br /><br />I had joined a yoga studio for several months when I first began in January of 2003.  The teacher taught the yoga using blocks, chair, belt and the wall.  It was a good start and I attended for 4 months, two to three times a week.  Whatever I learned I practiced at home, sometimes twice or more a day.  Even after I discontinued class, I kept up my practice several times a day.  I derived tremendous benefits from the practice.  I was healed of several serious ailments, known and unknown.<br /><br />I had been using the standard yoga books, such as \\"Light on Yoga\\" by BKS Iyengar, \\"30 Essential Yoga Poses\\" by Lasater, and many many others.  Not to mention many DVDs by various people of repute.  I found that despite my dedicated and persistent efforts I was not making headway in my ability to acquire the more advanced asanas.  It seemed that there were groups of muscles in my body that would not open no matter how earnestly I applied myself.<br /><br />Then I came across this book.  Specifically the first three chapters.  The asanas in the frist three chapters constitute the Pawanmuktasana series.  I have practiced them for a week, twice a day.  My body and mind seemed to have ascended into another realm.  These seemingly simple asanas have a PROFOUND effect on one's being.  I am at a complete loss to describe their wonderful and deep benefits.  Practice of this series has done more for me in the last week than all the numerous benefits I derived through my practice over the last nearly 6 years.<br /><br />I am at a total loss to explain why the Pawanmuktasana series has not been written of in other books of yoga!  It is a VERY POWERFUL series to bring about a total change in the physiology and mental patterns of a person.  If I had known about this series soonerI would have become a very advanced practitioner by now.<br /><br />However, nothing is lost due to the delay!  I only hope that people who find themselves stuck in their practice and unable to make gains, would read this review and start to practice the Pawanmuktasana series!  I cannot sufficiently applaud its power and benefits.<br /><br />Also to be noted is the fact that this classic text is put out by the Bihar School of Yoga founded by a great Sage -- Swami Satyananda Saraswati.  This school is perhaps the only school in the world that grants degrees in yoga -- bachelors, masters and PhDs.  They are in the forefront of the research being conducted in the healing of diseases through the various yogic practices.  The body of knowledge that has accumulated since its founding in 1964 has found its way into the contents of this book as well.  It is not a book just put together in an amateurish manner.  It is LOADED and AUTHENTIC!<br /><br />If one practices the seemingly simple Pawanmuktasana series alone for a fortnight, he or she will become a brand new person!  One will be astonished by the transformative powers of this seemingly simple series of asanas.  Since it is the tendancy of the mind to associate power with complexity, it is only natural to think of this seemingly simple series to be ineffective.  You will be TRULY surprised!<br /><br />The discovery of the Pawanmuktasana series is the greatest discovery of my entire yoga practice over the last six years!  Such is its power!<br /><br />They have the capacity to open up the body and allow the flow of energy through it like few other asana practices.  Once these have been practiced for a long time, I believe the other asanas should come naturally.  I cannot say for certain, since I have only practiced the Pawanmuktasana series for a week.  However, by extrapolating along the gains I have made in this short duration the foregoing claim is likely to be true.<br /><br />I think most people who practice yoga,do want to make progress at every stage.  No one will be content to just stay at the same level year after year.  If that is the case with you, then I strongly advise you to purchase this book and practice the three chapters on Pawanmuktasana in earnest.<br /><br />I would also like to recommend a DVD, if I may, for the practice of Pawanmuktasana series.  This DVD is \\"Yog Science Part 1 & 2 Pranayam & Yog Asan\\" by Swami Ramdev ji.  It is available through Amazon and other dealers through Amazon's site.  After practicing this series through the book or the DVD, I assure you your practice will improve by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />My search for \\"THE\\" book and DVD on yoga has finally come to an end :-)

013168728X|5.0|This book is a wonderful read about image processing.  Having read most of the 1st edition (yes I'm reading all of the 3rd), I can say that this 3rd edition is larger (yet not insurmountable) with more examples, explanations, mathematical development and new material.  I'm currently in the chapter about frequency domain processing and must say that the previous chapter about spatial domain processing is more robust, even now including a good introduction to fuzzy logic.  Anyhow, with a good background in applied math and Matlab programming, this material is easy reading for me, but should also be accessible enough for anyone with a general technical background.
B000NDEZPA|4.0|I am 45 years old and maybe too old fashioned.  My best kind of modern musics ( as opposed to classical musics) are those of the 50's, 60's, and early 70's.  I have most musics of the 80's superficial, and those afterwards just not memorable, including U2.  But I must say I like all of the songs of this disks.  Both the lyrics and the melodies are nice.  The titled song, The Story, though is the least well performed.  Brandi's diction is terrible.  The songs overall are not well crafted as those good oldies.  Yet, I have found listened to these many times.  This is my first introduction to Brandi Carlile, and I intend to buy another disc to find our more about her and her band.
031606792X|1.0|Fantasy? Yes, fantasy but dangerous for young girls. It's all about the boys girls. Find your \\"soul mate\\" or else you will whither on the vine. You'll pine, pout until you and your \\"soul mate\\" are bonded. Pretentious claptrap. Sad, that in this day and age, someone again directs young women to find their fulfillment in life through their boyfriend--vampire or human. I thought we'd moved past this but, apparently, not.

1878424505|1.0|Ruiz has come up with four principles from ancient Toltec wisdom. If one adopts these four agreements, Ruiz argues, they will help bring a sense of peace and happiness to one's life. Generally the agreements sound reasonable enough: don't take things personally, say only good things about others, etc. So far, so good. But there's some serious theoretical problems that underlie Ruiz's plan. Ruiz seems to suggest that the self can determine the majority of one's experience outside of social context. He claims that society is composed of collective dreams. Even recognizing that Ruiz is infusing dreams with more importance than western culture generally does, it still strikes me that the message here is that if one has fortified one's spirit with these four principles, nothing anyone else says or does can strongly affect you. Maybe I'm too close-minded, but I just can't buy it. We all live in social and cultural worlds, and those worlds do shape our experience, whether we like it or not.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Bruce Wayne / Batman (Christian Bale), the guardian of Gotham City, has begun to wonder if he can ever hang up his cowl or if he is fated to battle the criminal element in darkness forever.  His hope of a normal life hinges on the \\"white knight of Gotham City,\\" DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who can act in the light and within the system; if he can take Batman's place, it will be a powerful indicator that Gotham has become a healthy city.  This transition appears to be on track until the Joker (Heath Ledger) begins his rise in the criminal underworld.  He is anarchy and unrestrained self-interest incarnate, pure and simple.  The Joker and Batman are opposites, and the soul of Harvey Dent becomes their battlefield, thereby setting the stage for a tragedy.    Director / co-writer Christopher Nolan has surpassed his excellent first film of this series.  Everyone brings their A-game.  I  confess that I found the script to be unfocused and chaotic at times, but I was completely won over by the time the credits rolled for two primary reasons.  First, the film's last act, and particularly its final moments, brings all the thematic threads together in an unexpected fashion.  Secondly, the episodic nature of the screenplay made me feel that Batman and the Joker had a history of conflict by the end of the film, rather than one big encounter.  It seemed like a more faithful adaption of their relationship from the comics.    If another Batman film is never made, I will feel completely satisfied.  However, given the huge success of this one, there will obviously be a third.  I just hope they don't blow a good run a la \\"Spider Man 3.\\"
B0018S6YO4|3.0|Pop superstar Rihanna's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, was without a doubt her biggest CD yet. And the re-release of it, with three extra tracks, has been even more successful. Of course, there is no mystery as to why. The answer can be summed up in one word: \\"Disturbia\\". This jumpy tune, and its catchy synth beat, are taking the nation by storm at the moment--but the rest of the album (including the songs from last year) cannot be overlooked in \\"Disturbia\\"'s wake.    Overall this is a very solid pop/R&B album, with a mix of energetic dance tracks and wispy slow jams, and of course \\"Umbrella\\" which falls somewhere in between. \\"Question Existing\\" was one of her more emotional and interesting cuts, but it hasn't been released as a single yet, so not as many people can appreciate it. \\"Rehab\\" and the title track are the best ballads on the CD, along with \\"Take A Bow\\", which shot up to #1 on the charts early this past summer.    Rihanna herself has a very high voice which is capable of a decent belt, even if it may be a bit whiny. What is important is that it is identifiable and stands out. She collaborates here with Jay-Z, Ne-Yo, and Maroon 5 and has two tracks produced by the legendary Timbaland. These songs are standouts, and considering that she's only 20, it's an impressive lineup to be working with.    The album is far from perfect, mind you. There are a couple tracks (\\"Say It\\" and \\"Push Up On Me\\") that get pretty annoying and repetitive quickly and unfortunately they do bring the rest down a bit. There is also an excess of ballads all together, which becomes sluggish and boring even though the songs are good on their own.    Now that Rihanna is truly a superstar thanks to getting a new image and releasing this, her biggest album yet, here's hoping that she'll continue with the success, and hopefully learn to shed some of the more irritating aspects along the way.
B001E95ZNI|4.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" combines the best of traditional and modern Westerns. Ed Harris, who directs as well as stars in the film, has created a great combination of the two perpectives in this adaptation of the Robert B. Parker (Spenser For Hire) novel.<br /><br />Harris plays Virgil Cole, who with his partner Everett Hitch (played by Viggo Mortensen), roams the West as hired guns who come in and tame towns where lawlessness reigns. Such is the case in Appaloosa, which is run by rancher Randall Bragg, who killed the town marshal (an old friend of Cole's) and his two deputies. Cole and Hitch begin the cleanup process straightaway, but everything becomes complicated with the appearance in town of Allison French (played by Renee Zellweger), a young widow who captures the heart of crusty Cole and soon, the hardened lawman moves in her. But later, she comes on Hitch, setting the stage for issues of life, future, and loyalty to be explored while the lawmen deal with the woman and the wily Bragg, who has a few tricks up his sleeve.<br /><br />The look, feel, and the tone feels very traditional, but the screenplay and action are more modern in their staging, which means the language is saltier, and the action faster, just as it would be in real life. Harris and Mortensen seem like they have been acting in Westerns their entire career. Zellweger hits the right notes as a woman  who does what she has to do to survive.<br /><br />This is a great film, and one that most Western fans should readily enjoy.
B001E95ZNI|4.0|Just had to title this with one of my favorite NYTimes crossword answers.  Depending on the degree of puzzle difficulty, the clue is usually something like \\"'High Noon', e.g.\\"  Appaloosa is no classic High Noon, but it is an homage and a slight satiric wink to the classic Western genre.  Ed Harris and Viggo Mortenson are the good guys and Jeremy Irons, a long way from Brideshead, is the very, very bad guy.  There is the no-nonsense but kindly prostitute, and then there is Renee Zellweger, a puzzle and a pleasure to good and bad alike, and -- to me -- even confounding after the movie is ended.  The dialogue is largely laconic, the violence rapid, at both expected and unexpected moments.  Mostly, though, Appaloosa is a well-acted, well-scripted and entertaining yarn.  If you stick around through the credits, you even get to hear Ed Harris sing country.

B001CDLAT4|5.0|BARAKA is a beautiful travelogue directed by Ron Fricke, the cinematographer of KOYAANISQATSI.  It is similar, but superior, to KOYAANISQATSI and its sequels, largely because it doesn't have quite as much of a political axe to grind, and because it is not designed to highlight the music of Philip Glass.    Instead, BARAKA is a profound, moving experience.  I guarantee you will find in it at least a half-dozen moments of pure wonder, and probably many more.  You will also see images of things you've never seen before, or even imagined.  BARAKA explores natural wonders, religious practices, and humans in harmony and in conflict with nature and themselves.  In many ways it remains me of the PLANET EARTH series, but focused on humanity, and with no narration.    BARAKA contains scenes of great beauty, great ugliness, and great humor.    It is also a spiritual meditation, and I make it a point to watch this movie every Easter season, even though it is not particularly Christian in its outlook.    Buy it.  Watch it on the best movie system you or your friends own.  You will certainly enjoy this film.  What I can't say is whether this new DVD release is superior to the old one, which is no longer in print.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|Another one of my friends got this for me as a gift. Again, I was giddy with delight (they all know me so well)! While I thought it odd that Disney would reproduce something that was fairly dark, it was so great to see this movie again, as I hadn't seen it in years. The remaster was wonderful as the colors were more vibrant. I especially loved all the bonus features like Frankenweenie, Vincent and The storyboard to film comparison. I thought the cost was high at first, but when I saw the 3D bust as the cover and all the extras, I realize the cost was quite fair. This is a great buy for followers of this cult classic or anything Tim Burton.

B000EGCITG|5.0|I got this CD through the Pepsi Stuff promotion, mainly because I love the song \\"Who Knew\\".  I'm middle aged and assumed I'd like just that one track. I never expected to discover so many great songs with such intelligent and often funny lyrics.  I'm now realizing many of the songs I've heard and liked on the radio were Pink.      While I still can't get enough of \\"Who Knew\\" - and I agree with another reviewer that the song must be one of the best songs ever - I'm equally smitten with the energy, catchy tunes and attitude of \\"Leave Me Alone/I'm Lonely\\" and \\"U and UR Hand\\".  I've had a hard time getting myself to stop playing them long enough to give the other tracks a fair listen, so I'm still discovering gems among them.      If bad language bothers you or if you have kids you don't want to hear it (and you don't want to have to wait till they're not around to listen to this CD), I'd recommend the clean version.  I personally enjoy the additional attitude and emphasis that it brings to these songs and don't find it objectionable.  My only regret is that I waited so long to get this CD and didn't buy it last winter when I first heard \\"Who Knew\\".  I also wish I'd discovered Pink sooner - impressed she writes her song and love the voice - who knew?

B000002JS6|5.0|This is probably the single most important album I've ever heard. Without this, I wouldn't be anywhere with music. I'd be listening to all this new crap that sucks. From the opening gong of Hells Bells to the final note of Brian Johnson's favorite Rock N Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, you will not be disappointed. When I saw them in 2001 on the Stiff Upper Lip tour, they played half the album, or close to it. I saw Hell's Bells, they opened with Shook Me All Night Long, Halfway through I heard Rock and Roll..., Back in Black, and the second song was Shoot to Thrill. If you don't own any version, someone should smack you. Where have you been? This band holds the 2nd highest number of catalogue sales in the U.S. second only to the Beatles, but that's no surprise. Most of the album still gets radio play. Buy it now (probably the 2003 remaster) now. Then go back and listen to Bon Scott piss people off.

031606792X|3.0|This was a good teen vampire love story (all 4 books). It kinda dragged out cause all of the really mussy stuff that would appeal more to the \\"girlie\\" side of the book and guys reading this (being one myself) will struggle a little cause it last for about a few pages to sometimes the whole chapter but that is what sometimes made the story so fellas you have to read through it. This 4 book story which I'm glad someone did was give the whole transformation from human to vamp a good swift kick cause I really got tired of some of the other vampire novels that got into a whole drawn out story only to be wrapped up in three to four chapters and leaving you guessing. Not going to write out the plot or give away anything to the 4 books which starts out with Twilight, New moon, Eclipse and the last book Breaking Dawn in that order. You can get that from others here but back to what I was getting at that made me want to say to any guy out there that give this to any girl, woman or your wife and you will be happy that you did. And it wouldn't hurt to read cause the story actually sucks you in cause you want to see what happens next and that is rare for me to say about anyone who writes vampire books. Not to many have been catching my eye and this story did. Got the first book at the airport and was done with it in about five days and then just ordered the rest cause I wanted to know what happens to Bella (main character) and not forgetting what I wrote earlier that going from human to vamp in this story was done great and adding to some of the already lore of vampires or debunking some is done just as good. I have read a few Anne Rice novels but this series has me looking more closely at this author for future books and vamp fixes. Remember guys get this whole series for your wife, daughter, etc...she will love you for it. And if you are a guy and looking for something good to read and you will actually have something to talk about with your significant other then read the first book and then give it to her instant free pass to the golf course or football game plus it is a great story.

0307388921|3.0|Like others, I saw the film Fight Club but had not read any of Palahniuk's books before.  This book had been sitting on my TBR shelf for a while, and with the upcoming release of the movie I figured it was time to give it a try.<br /><br />The word \\"sick\\" seems to occur frequently in reviews of Palahniuk's work.  After reading this book I understand why.  Many of the images in the book are quite disgusting, but \\"sick\\" is also a good word to describe the world as Palahniuk portrays it.  Despite the high gross-out factor, this book is at times laugh out loud funny - indeed I could not decide if some of the scenes were for shock value or attempts at dark humor.<br /><br />The protagonist Victor behaves in an appalling manner, but because the book is written in first person we can almost understand why and feel sympathetic towards him.  However, whenever Victor starts to become likable, Palahniuk quickly does something to make us gag or laugh again.  What a strange book.

The first two (disc one) takes you up to his riding off to the first Congress.  The second goes through Washington's being elected President, and the last features his own presidency, tragedies, the rise of his son John Quincy to be president himself, and his death, the last of two (Thomas Jefferson the other) to survive, both dying on the 4th of July 50 years after independence.<br /><br />I was moved by this movie, and think ever more highly of Paul Giamatti for his acting.  I received insights I did not have before, and while some may complain about the details, for myself, this was an extraordinary three hours or so watched over the course of three evenings.<br /><br />In books, consider:<br />[[ASIN:0743226720 1776]]<br />[[ASIN:0684848716 What Kind of Nation: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United States]]<br />[[ASIN:1400065445 The Thirteen American Arguments: Enduring Debates That Define and Inspire Our Country]]
B001AU8ZLK|1.0|The pre-release buzz around 'Viva La Vida' was similar to that of U2's, 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'.   While HTDAAB delivered, Viva La Vida falls way short.  The tracks are lifeless and over-produced with little dynamics or excitement.   Part of it is the mix - Chris and piano are up front along with strings and other keyboard parts while the rest of the band are moved way to back. Jon Buckland's contributions are most notably muted or absent.  The result sounds like a Chris Martin solo project. Regardless, the first minute and a half of '42' are pure bliss.
B000AYELVA|5.0|I have enjoyed ALL of the X-Men movies so this one is no exception. I'd recommend them all if you can find someone willing to give them up!
B001C08RHA|5.0|Yes, I am one of those irritating people who have never read the comic (sorry, but I am simply not a comic reader--more so because I never had the opportunity to become addicted) and had barely heard of Iron Man until I saw the trailor for this very movie back in the day.<br /><br />So... my review will be based simply on my impressions of the movie with no reference to Marvel or comic anything else.  Because I don't know any of that.<br /><br />To begin, this is a fantastic movie.  I don't know enough about movie making to disect the details, but I like to think I can avoid the truly terrible and I do know what I like.  So in my humble opinion this is a truly wonderful movie, having everything I think a truly wonderful movie needs:  good plot, decent effects, great acting, and lots of heart.  Yes, I was honestly touched by this movie.<br /><br />And that is because what truly got me was the theme.  I'm not a fan of war (I don't think anyone truly is) and there was something about the whole fight-for-peace thing that got to me--and this is doubled by the change of heart for lead character Tony Stark.  Sue me, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.<br /><br />So this theme leads into a delightfully action-y storyline that is simple enough to carry itself through without being brain-killing.  The cast is SUPERB. I can't think of anyone else I could get to play a part in this assortment of characters.  And these characters?  A great blend of humanity mixed with a definite \\"fun\\" feel.  Wonderful combination.<br /><br />And I can't get over how the screen sizzles when Downey and Paltrow have a scene together. And they never even kiss. That is a testament against all those that think rampant sex is the only way to show passion on the silver screen.<br /><br />Apparently this movie was enough to please someone who does not read comics.  It has the action, romance, and heart to make a quality movie.
032147404X|5.0|Unlike a previous review, I liked the humor.  Reading a dull, 'school book' is not my thing.  You can learn a lot from this book and not fall asleep doing it.  I have read several of Scott's books and like them all BECAUSE they are funny at the same time they are teaching you the facts that you need to take good shots...or work an Adobe program.  I'm just a serious amateur, but I've shot some events that are important to friends and the information in this book was valuable.
B0000029DD|2.0|All I've heard for almost 15 years now is 'Like, oh my God, Jeff Buckley's music is so, like, beautiful...' Well I decided to drink the Kool-aid and buy the CD- I figured, 'Hey, I like tragic rock stars, I like beautiful music when it's done right. I'll give it a shot.' I'm sorry I can't give a review to all the songs because I was always either asleep or had left the room by song six. He's the classic singer without a song- his lyrics are full of the type of mawkish, frat-boy pathos that sorority girls swoon over and anyone with a brain rolls their eyes or cringes at. He's nothing compared to the Cowboy Junkies or Nick Drake or Elliot Smith or Simon or Garfunkel. I only gave it two stars because it is indeed a good cd if you can't fall asleep. Another case of early death making someone into an undeserved legend. Maybe he might have matured into the genuine article but I guess we'll never know.

1400079179|2.0|I know that the world is still somewhat obsessed with this book, and I I guess I can understand why. It's a lot of fun, I will admit, and Dan Brown certainly did his homework, authentic or not, on some awesome bits of history and religion. This provides a super-fun mystery--hey, who doesn't appreciate a super-fun mystery with lots of fast-paced action?<br /><br />However, so totally overrated! I think so much of the hype came from the supposedly controversial nature. You know what? Make up your own minds and stop letting fiction decide your beliefs for you!<br /><br />It is definitely a fun read, but the characters are ridiculous, cliche, and flat, as well as the relationships.
0575081406|3.0|The beginning of this book is wonderful.  I was drawn immediately to the main characters, the writing is very good, and the story engaging.  The book starts in the present and then focuses on Kvothe's early years with his family.  The evil force (this is fantasy after all, there has to be a dark side) are the Chandrian, a group of demonic beings with a hidden agenda.  The Chandrian are described so well you can feel their malevolence.         Once Kvothe gets to the university, the book drags.  There is only so much I can read about the mysterious love of Kvothe's life.  Kvothe is fascinated by her, but the author's portrayal of Denna reads more like an adolescent's fantasy woman than an actual person.  She is wooden, unsympatheric and uninteresting.  Fortunately, towards the end, the story picks up again and I will certainly read the next one.  Maybe Mr. Rothfuss will kill Denna off and focus on the adventures and the evil Chandrian that he described so well.       One other note.  This book is not as complex and well written as the Song of Ice and Fire series, but it is not as bleak either.  Rothfuss is like a $20 bottle of wine, where Martin is a single malt scotch.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and the CD even more. It is great to listen to on long trips because it has a collection of both fun songs and serious songs.  Songs that deal with different facets of life. The songs remind you of how sweet it was to be young and carefree, how life has a tendency of getting serious on you and time passes quickly. Most important of all it reminds you to stop and savor life. Wow! All that from one simply beautiful CD. I would highly recommened it.

B001CC7PKS|5.0|I subscribed to the early comic book. I liked Daredevil because he was different with his disabilities (blind and mortal) and strengths ('radar-sense' and martial arts style of moving and fighting). I thought the film was a great version of my favorite underdog hero. There's a dark feeling in the look and story of this 'early wire-swinging' hero. A earthy cross between Batman and Spiderman with a realistic approach that is almost noirish. The picture and sound are BluRay bests! Basically, Daredevil is a blind stick fighter, who is so hyper-sensitive, that he has to medicate himself and get into a isolation tank, to get any sleep. And he's got a girl. Give DAREDEVIL a chance.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|It seems like the last few times that Metallica has released an album everyone says it's gonna sound like old Metallica, with Death Magnetic I would say it's true for the most part.

B001DDBCUU|1.0|Ok, I watched all of the Sex and the City seasons. The first season is still the best, then progressively gets worse. While this movie might be \\"long-awaited\\" it is also too late for any good to come of it. The film itself was virtually a paid advertisement and is also was a complete mess, ruined by the simple fact that the story was over before it began.<br /><br />The film begins with a reiteration of the TV shows \\"funny\\" highlights to get people emotionally engaged into the world of Carrie and her friends again. Once the story gets going we soon realize that Carrie and Big have not tied the knot. So now we know the major plot of the movie. Because of this we know one of them will have some sort of commitment issue and post pone the wedding. Big surprise.<br /><br />Along with this, all of the girls have their own trite issues all at the same time over stupid stuff. I have resolved, at this point, that these girls are certifiably insane. None of them deserve the relationships they have, nor do they know how relationships work. They react way off the handle over a single and incidental flaw or behavior from their guys, and they shun them for months on end! These girls are some of the most irrational beings portrayed on television.<br /><br />This movie is only a testament to their insanity. To further this problem, the studio decided to release an Extended Version which closes nearly on the 3-hour mark! Watching this movie, I was thinking to myself, \\"When will this movie end?!?\\" It just goes on and on with no funny moments whatsoever. I feel like all of the humor is dated because the show has been off the air for like 5 years now. Although the girls have good chemistry, its really not enough to make this a likable movie. Its a waste of time on their part, the film crews part, and an insult to the audience to feel that we need this movie in our lives. The fact that a 150-minute version exists is testimony to how much bad footage exists and that they had no idea of where the movie was headed from the beginning. So I say, even if you are a fan of the show, do not ruin the memory by watching this movie. It will really make you resent the show and its characters. The TV show ended well and appropriately, and now they are beating a dead horse. Do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. If you enjoy watching insane women over react to small things, watch The L-Word, at least there you will get lots and lots of nudity among the craziness.ded from the beginning.

B001CIPU3G|1.0|Just picked this up yesterday, and must say I am really dissapointed. Trivium took a major step with their last release (The Crusade), as the terrific clean vocals elevated the group to elite status and I found the band to rival only titans such as Iced Earth, Metallica, and Opeth in terms of the best the genre has to offer. As such, I was waiting with bated breath the release of Shogun. Unfortunately, the group seems to have been pressured by their \\"hardcore\\" following to return to the 'screaming' style of vocals. The songs suffer, and it's a shame because this is a group of musicians that are on top of their game. EVERY Song on this release is marred at one point or another by the cookie monster vocals.<br /><br />Why would a band sacrifice musical and vocal quality in this way in order to \\"save face\\" with their fanbase? The only reason I can come up with is Crusade didnt' go Platinum or Gold, (thus putting them in position to be the 'new' Metallica, a label I am sure this band was striving for) so the decision was made to simply go back to the \\"hardcore\\" singing style as they perceive they have nothing to lose...<br /><br />In summation, if you are a traditional metal head who enjoys melody along with pummelling riffs, stay away from this but hold onto your copy of Crusade.  However, if you enjoy metalcore and screaming vocals, you will find this to your liking.  I can't expect Trivium to make it to the next level of metal greatness unless they go back to the more traiditional metal style of Crusade.
0330449605|4.0|I was a bit hesitant in picking up \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" by Kate Morton.  After my disappointment with \\"The House at Riverton,\\" I wasn't sure if I was willing to invest more time.  Pleased to say that the story hooked me from the get-go, and though the book is longer than I thought necessary, it was altogether an entertaining read.<br /><br />At the heart of this big, fat tale (645 pages) is a mystery.  In 1913, a dock master, Hugh, discovers a four-year-old girl who's been left alone on a wharf in Queensland, Australia after all passengers had disembarked from a boat that sailed from England.  Taking pity on her, Hugh takes her home to his wife, Lil.  In spite of Hugh's and Lil's efforts to find the girl's family, time passes and no one claims the tyke.  Having hit her head while onboard the boat, the little girl couldn't even remember her own name and all she could recall was a woman she calls the Authoress who was supposed to sail with her.  Hugh and Lil decide to keep her as their own and name her Nell.<br /><br />In the present day, Nell's granddaughter, Cassandra, is grieving Nell's passing.  As she goes through Nell's notebooks, she realizes that her grandmother had never stopped searching for her true parents.  Cassie takes over the search, which leads her to England and to a small Cornish village, and finally, to a decrepit cottage and its walled garden...a garden that swallowed the secrets of the 1900s and buried within its grounds the fascinating and tragic story of the Mountrachets and the woman a child had called the Authoress.<br /><br />A challenge to the reader will be the constant switching of perspective from past to present and in between, primarily the years of 1913, 1975 and 2005.  It's a bit off-putting in the first few chapters but after awhile, it's no longer an encumbrance.  Though the main story is Nell's parentage, the novel is dense with stories of the characters whose lives intersect and create the environment upon which Nell's birth and subsequent abandonment hinges.  There are also many incidental details that don't necessarily impact the story but are included nevertheless to bring alive the era being depicted and add realism to the backstories.  Included, too, are fairy tales by the Authoress that serve as allegories of the truths secreted by the doomed Mountrachet family, a family that \\"wanted things they shouldn't or couldn't have\\" and destroyed lives with their avarice, entitlements and perversions.<br /><br />It can be a grueling read at close to 700 pages but the mystery itself kept me reading and speculating.  Clues are parceled out in small doses and it takes a very long time, almost the end, before one can put together a clear picture of Nell's history.  That's a good decision on the author's part as otherwise, a reader's interest would likely wane quickly.  As Cassie puts it, \\"the closer we get, the more tangled the web becomes.\\"<br /><br />The characters are, for the most part, very interesting, though a bit on the melodramatic side, but it's the kind of melodrama that befits the Victorian era and the early 1900s.  Of particular note is the emerging technology of x-ray in the mid-1890s, the careless use of which put into motion a series of tragic events that would reverberate for over 100 years.<br /><br />It's an enthralling read and, with patience from a reader, delivers very satisfactory answers.  Stories about foundlings, secrets and Victorian women have been done hundreds of times in various iterations and can get tiresome fast if the core story is weak.  Glad to say that no such error is committed in \\"The Forgotten Garden.\\"  The first few chapters pulled me in very quickly and I found myself compulsively on the same quest for the truth.

0739367676|4.0|I have to admit, I do not like to read...however, I bought the audio CD's in order to enjoy the Twilight series.  I am kind of glad I did, because with the amount of detail that Stephanie Meyer writes with, it is a bit exhausting.  The books were slow at the beginning, but always made it worth it in the end.  At one point, I was so eager to finish, that I stayed up listening until 5am.      Spoilers below:    I know a few people did not appreciate the happy ending in this last book.  I am a bit torn on this issue.  Although, I am happy it all worked out, it is not realistic.  I mean, the entire series was based on the results of their choices.  Every character made a choice that later \\"bit\\" them in the end.  But it always worked out.  Every time, it worked out.      If I were to do an alternate ending, I think that Bella should have had to choose between Edward and her daughter, and one of them should have died.  As it stands, there is no real consequence for any of the actions and choices that they had made.    Bella is a weird character as well, always pessimistic and optimistic at the same time.  I think she says the word \\"fine\\" about 5 million times in these books.  She worries about what will happen and predicts the worst outcome, but then thinks that having a mutant child will all work out.  Weird, huh?    At one point, I was very uncomfortable with Edward's over-protectiveness.  It was almost too obsessive, his love for her.  The story was in the end a good one.  I would recommend it to everyone to just experience it.  But, it looks like the crowd is split.  Half of you will love it, and the other half won't.  Make up your own mind, or do what I will do, and make up your own alternate ending.
0618918248|5.0|One will readily expect the perceptions and reviews of Richard Dawkins' THE GOD DELUSION to fall along what might euphemistically be called \\"party lines.\\" Blue Staters, rationalists, and the college educated (especially in mathematics, engineering, the sciences, and technology) will find it thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating even if they disagree with the author's views. Red Staters, religious fundamentalists, and readers (if any) with less than a college education will be repulsed, likely to pit it against the Bible and regard Mr. Dawkins' as already marked for hellfire and eternal damnation. In the broad sweep that is religion, few minds will be changed, but was that really the author's objective? I think not.     Mr. Dawkins offers clues to his game plan fairly early on, arguing that atheists have no reason to be apologetic. He argues vigorously against the, \\"I'm an atheist, but...\\" position offered by many, treating it as an unnecessary concession to the forces of blind, irrational faith who would never reciprocate. Mr. Dawkins sets out as well to convince agnostics (among whom I've long considered myself) that their position is an unfounded hedge, hoping to convince them that outright atheism is the only logical conclusion to be drawn from so many arguments. His arguments are direct and persuasive, and I for one will confess to being swayed far closer to his position than previously.      THE GOD DELUSION is thorough in its approach and exceedingly well structured. Presenting his case like a lawyer in an extended closing argument, Dawkins moves from chapter to chapter setting up his opponents' many historical arguments for the existence of God and religion and then demolishing each of them by force of reason and scientific argument. He does this in a direct and highly readable, almost colloquial style, while injecting a sense of wry humor throughout that serves admirably to lighten the discussion. Dawkins demonstrates a remarkable scientific, philosophical, and even pop cultural range, with multiple references to the incomparable, much missed Douglas Adams. To my great surprise, he draws as well on theories from Lee Smolin (multiple universes emerging from black holes in a Darwinian, evolutionary style) and Julian Jaynes (theories of the origins of human consciousness in the bicameral mind), both of whose books I read some years ago and had thought long since forgotten by most. Equally enlightening for me were Dawkins extensive quotes from America's Founding Fathers, making it eminently clear (despite so many right wing conservative statements to the contrary) that the United States was not formed as a Christian state, nor that of any other religion. To the contrary, the Founding Fathers appear, by their own words, largely to have been atheists, or at least atheistic leaning agnostics.     Review readers should note that Dawkins does not simply confine himself to the question of existence of a higher being. He addresses issues of altruistic behavior and morality from an evolutionary perspective, debates the relative merits of religion over the course of human history, and presents (in Chapter 9) a devastating argument against the worldwide forced inculcation of children into religious belief by their parents. Quoting Victor Hugo at the opening of that chapter, \\"There is in every village a torch - the teacher; and an extinguisher - the clergyman.\\" From my own life experience, seldom have truer words been spoken.     With well over a thousand reviews posted on Amazon alone, I see no reason to summarize the book's content or arguments. In fact, the only way to do real justice to the author's positions is to read it in its entirety - no summary can adequately convey Dawkins' step-by-step demolition of those who argue on behalf of God, faith, or religion. For those who have doubts in these areas and those who are left queasy over the clear and present danger religious fundamentalism poses to democratic American institutions and its role in international terrorism and the threat of broad scale war, THE GOD DELUSION is an excellent palliative. Large swaths of post-millennial America are moving increasingly toward theocracy, a trend viewed with alarm by most of the rest of the educated, Western world. One need only look at the disturbing comments from Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin (expecting to see the Messiah return in her lifetime and incorporating the end of days into her admittedly limited foreign policy views) to see just how close to reality this is becoming.     For those who consider themselves even minimally open-minded on the subject of religion and the existence of an all-powerful being (\\"whatever you conceive him to be, hairy thunderer or cosmic muffin\\" in the immortal words of the National Lampoon), THE GOD DELUSION is a book well worth reading and contemplating.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|Personally, I gotta give it to these guys: this album really kicks balls and was well worth the wait. Literally from start to finish a killer modern metal album. I purchased release day and it's been spinning ever since. These guys are truly underrated and this stuff is deeper and more technical than they're given credit for. It's definitely an upgrade compared to \\"FROM EMBER TO INFERNO\\" (meh) , \\"ASCENDANCY\\" (which I really dug) and \\"THE CRUSADE\\" (which was ok), much darker and more epic.     If you're a fan of they're older material you'll absolutely love this one. As Heafy himself said, \\"SHOGUN is the past, present, and future of TRIVIUM\\". Pick it up!!!

B00066N8JS|5.0|I own an older album with many of these tracks. The SACD (Super Audio CD) version is far clearer with greater detail than the original recordings. If your curious about this controversial band, this is the version to buy.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL REVIEW INFORMATION:<br />I was reminded by someone who commented on my review that I should have probably pointed out that SACDs must be played in a SACD-player for you to appreciate the additional resolution that SACDs offer. Many (most, in fact) SACD albums are actually \\"Hybrid CDs\\" that have two albums recorded on one disc, a standard 16-bit CD album, and the 24-bit SACD album, alloying you to play your album in anyone's CD-player but being most enjoyed if played in a SACD-player.<br /><br />I made the assumption that people who would read my review would know the difference between SACD and CD players (I'm a BAD Engineering student! Shame on me!).<br /><br />IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT that this NIN album (in standard CD playback and playback through my 44.1KHz 16-bit music server) is a better recording than the original album that contained many of the tracks on this CD. It must have been remastered somewhat from the single's original releases.

B00001IVR0|5.0|This disc contains 2 concertos in the same key (B flat major) by Mozart and Brahms, performed by Wilhelm Backhaus on piano, with Karl Böhm conducting Wiener Philharmonker. The performance of Mozart's B flat concerto might not be everybody's favorite; it is an earnest and sincere performance nonetheless. The real treasure of this disc, in my opinion, is the Brahms B flat concerto.    Allow me to make a bold and personal statement: I have never heard any Brahms concerto performance (live or on record) which comes close to this recording in its grace and charm, and above all its understated yet overwhelming emotional power. Both the piano and orchestra playing are absolutely marvelous. However, what makes this recording so special was that some \\"miracle\\" seemed to have happened during the recording session: The piano and orchestra sounds are completely meshed with each other, and the music making seemed to come from a \\"whole\\". The excellent sound engineering and masterful transfer all add to the whole experience. This is a performance I worn out 2 audio cassettes (in grade school) before getting a CD. -- There is no way I can describe the \\"experience\\" in words. You have to experience it yourself!    ----------  Backhaus performed in seventy seasons, and established himself as one of the greatest German pianists. However, English speaking countries (notably U.S. and U.K.) have curiously not warmed up to him. He met with Brahms and heard him conduct both his piano concertos with d'Albert (Backhaus's teacher) as soloist. This performance is not Gardiner's \\"revolutionary Brahms\\". It is, on the other hand, Teutonic tradition at its finest. Bachkaus would die 2 years after this recording was made. This recording, together with some of his Beethoven recordings, is a testament of his pianism.    By the way, this has a sister version [[ASIN:B0000042E0 Brahms: Piano Concerto No.2/Mozart: Piano Concerto No.27]], but they are both discontinued. Grab either one of them while theyare still available.    My highest recommendation.

B00004BZ16|5.0|I bought the original 3 LP version of Sandinista in late 1980 / early 1981, not long after it came out. I'd never heard anything by the Clash and had only the vaguest idea of what punk was all about, but I'd been reading about how great this group was supposed to be, so I thought I'd check this album out.  After all, it barely cost more than a single LP, so I figured that, if nothing else, their hearts must be in the right place.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I didn't know what to make of this when I first listened to it. As I recall, my first reaction was, \\"This is punk???\\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. My expectations were turned upside down and inside out. I didn't know what to make of it, but I kept going back to it over and over and over. I can't say that I even liked it at first. It was more that I was fascinated by it, that I felt compelled to understand it. It was a mystery , a puzzle that I grew to love and appreciate over time as I unraveled it ... or was it unraveling me?<br /><br />Looking back, more than 25 years later, I can see just how critical this album was in breaking down so much of my prior conditioning as a listener and preparing me for the great variety of new sounds I'd soon encounter and enjoy. And I still pull this out every so often (I have the 2 CD version now, vinyl is long gone, buh bye) and I become immersed in it all over again.  I know it's long and it rambles and goes astray here and there, but I love it just as it is.<br /><br />Having said that, I've had the feeling for a while now that, with some judicious edits, there was a killer double LP in here somewhere, at least as good and maybe even better than London Calling (which I also love, but it really begins to lose steam somewhere in that 3rd side of the original 2 LP set). So I sat down and hammered out what the 2 LP version of Sandinista would have looked like if I'd been in the producer's chair.  I kept most of the original sequencing intact, with just four exceptions (Somebody Got Murdered, The Call Up, Washington Bullets, and Version City were all moved into earlier positions in the track sequence).  Here's what I came up with:<br /><br />Side 1<br />01  The Magnificent Seven<br />02  Junco Partner<br />03  The Leader<br />04  Something About England<br />05  Rebel Waltz<br />06  Somebody Got Murdered<br /><br />Side 2<br />07  Look Here<br />08  The Crooked Beat<br />09  The Call Up<br />10  Washington Bullets<br />11  One More Time<br />12  One More Dub<br /><br />Side 3<br />13  Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice)<br />14  Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)<br />15  Corner Soul<br />16  Let's Go Crazy<br />17  If Music Could Talk<br />18  Version City<br /><br />Side 4<br />19  Police on My Back<br />20  Midnight Log<br />21  The Equaliser<br />22  Charlie Don't Surf<br />23  Junkie Slip<br />24  Kingston Advice<br />25  The Street Parade<br /><br />Deleted Tracks:<br />Hitsville U.K. - never cared for it; the only track I can absolutely do without ever hearing again<br />Ivan Meets G.I. Joe - amusing but sounds horribly dated now<br />The Sound of Sinners - not bad as gospel goes, but I'm really not into that genre<br />Broadway - I'm okay with this one but for me it's not essential<br />Lose This Skin - I actually like this one a lot but again it felt optional to me<br />Mensforth Hill - crazy backward track that I usually skip<br />Living in Fame - dub, I like it, but also not essential<br />Silicone on Sapphire - ditto<br />Version Pardner - ditto<br />Career Opportunities - kiddie rendition, somewhat amusing but hardly essential<br />Shepherds Delight - not awful but it's never really made much of an impression on me either<br /><br />One of the things I like the best about the track list I put together is that it all ends with Street Parade, which has always sounded like the natural end of the album to me anyway.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, I lost the kiddie version of \\"Guns of Brixton\\" which I actually like because it's short.  I suppose I might throw that into my 2 LP sequence if I could figure out a good place for it.<br /><br />One of these days, maybe I'll burn my own custom killer edited version of Sandinista.  Or maybe I won't. It's a great piece of work, even with its flaws and lapses, and it still continues to blow my mind, just as it always has.<br /><br />One last comment: the drumming on this thing! Good gawd! After all my years of listening, I've only recently begun to hear, really hear, Topper Headon's rhythm work. That guy could play ANYTHING and play it well. I think Topper has been sadly overlooked, not just as an essential contributor to the Clash, but as one of the finest rock/whatever drummers of his time.on of Sandinista.  Or maybe I won't.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|For a few years, I've been eagerly awaiting a comeback album from Metallica, known for the legendary \\"Master of Puppets\\" album. From 1999 to 2007, I haven't heard much real Metallica music. Sure, there was \\"S&M,\\" that \\"Mission: Impossible 2\\" song and \\"St. Anger,\\" but I was disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Death Magnetic\\" is definitely the album that revives Metallica with 10-minute metal marathons and blisteringly fast guitars and drums.<br /><br />Metallica kicks off the album with some slow, loud guitars, before drummer Lars Ulrich speeds the tempo to their trademark fast drum beat in the awesome smash-up song \\"That Was Just Your Life.\\" James Hetfield blurts out his lyrics like a madman, singing, \\"I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place/I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace/I blind my eyes, I hardly feel it passing me by/I open just in time to say goodbye.\\" Hetfield and Kirk Hammett also lay down the law with a killer solo.<br /><br />Metallica keeps this rhythm up throughout the entire album. Hetfield and Hammett kick up the volume with loud power chords in the song \\"Broken, Beat and Scarred.\\" Hetfield shows off reckless masculine pride, growling ferociously \\"Breaking your teeth on the hard life a'comin'/Show your scars!\\" With America in a perilous economic downfall, this song might be the one to life men's spirits.<br /><br />But Metallica also plays the monster in the ultimate metal anthem, \\"All Nightmare Long.\\" Even though the lyrics are a little lackluster, the chorus is an awesome show of bravado. With volume-pumping chords blasting in staccato bursts, Hetfield sings \\"'Cause we hunt you down without mercy/Hunt you down all nightmare long.\\" And right after Hetfield sings \\"'Cause your luck runs out,\\" Metallica engages into a fleeting frenzy of speedy drums and crazy virtuoso guitar solos.<br /><br />There are some times when Hetfield sings slow ballads in \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" and \\"The Unforgiven III.\\" Hetfield retains decent vocals in these songs, singing \\"Waiting for the one/The day that never comes<br />When you stand up and feel the warmth/but the sunshine never comes.\\" It's a heartfelt song for hope which has faded away.<br /><br />For the most part, however, I was waiting patiently for the killer guitar solos. After all, Metallica is one of the greatest speed metal marathon bands. And \\"Death Magnetic\\" is one of the best showings of speed metal from Metallica, especially after \\"St. Anger.\\" I'll be eagerly awaiting their next album for more speed metal.y that never comes  When you stand up and feel the warmth/but the sunshine never comes.\\" It's a heartfelt song for hope which has faded away.

0345455681|4.0|This is one of those stories that treats you to generations of key families and historical stories you don't always learn in school. I especially like how they tie a seemingly unimportant event early in the book to other events later on in the story timeline. The genealogy chart really helps also. I kept referring to it throughout. This is a good book to read during a holiday vacation as well.

0316042994|5.0|There are several really good reviews of this book including those by Gary F. Taylor and Mary Whipple, so I'll just comment on the book as a Catholic conversion story.  It has been said that \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" reflects in some sense Waugh's own conversion to Catholicism.  If that is why you are interested in this book, know that it is a subtle story.  On the surface Waugh paints a picture of Catholicism through the Marchmain family that is not very attractive.  The Marchmain family is rather split between those who remain devout Catholics and those who are rebelling against it, and for the most part those who are rebelling are painted in the more positive light.  That is rather oversimplifying it a bit because the characters are not one dimensional stereotypes.  Still, it gives you a general sense of the family dynamics and the surface portrait of Catholicism, and this remains the general tone throughout the book.  Don't expect some dramatic conversion to suddenly paint Catholicism as all perfect and rosy and right.  It's not to be found.  Yet Waugh still manages to somehow give one a sense of the power and importance of faith and grace in each of his character's lives.  It is not the same for every character, and it is not a neat tidy package for any of them, yet it seems always to be there.  For me, this quote from the book sums it up best:     \\"'I caught him with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread.'\\"      This is a memorable book and well worth reading.
B00008NRI8|4.0|I think this is a decent romantic comedy with a definite save the planet mentality. You're not bombarded by the romantic part, so can enjoy the witty jokes and actors with good comedic timing. Hugh Grant does a surprisingly good job at being yet another reluctant grown-up who falls in love just as reluctantly. I recommend this movie for chick-flick night every time.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I love this CD...I loved it so much that I downloaded it while I waited for my Amazon pre-order to arrive.  Contrary to other views posted here, this was no disappointment.  Ms. Hudson's style and class are signature sounds on this CD.  My favorite song is &#34;Giving Myself...&#34; What a perfect title for her first complete CD.  Isn't that what we all should do when we are embarking upon one of greatest endeavors - give ourselves fully and openly.  I &#34;spring my head&#34; to the energy of &#34;Pocketbook&#34; and swing to the melody of &#34;If This Isn't Love...&#34;  great music!

B00023B1LC|4.0|That wasn't a brand new idea - of making a movie about super-spy lost his memories. Well, may be that happens to often? Poor guys.  It's pale. Or may be even flat. No feelings. No thoughts. Even no humour. Some chase, \\"Mini\\" rocks, yaaawn. Boring and predictable. So Matt Damon couldn't save the movie - he had nothing to do, to play, but a couple of tricks. So the coolest thing in the whole story is that advanced \\"laser pointer\\". (In Russian translation they called it \\"microfilm\\". Ugh.)  And, by the way, those attempts to put Slavic languages in the movies are boring too. You know, a super-mega-hyper-absolute-spy risks a lot, if he tries to use a passport with a senseless bunch of cyrillic letters instead of name. What a shame.
1427204837|5.0|My daughter bought this book and said I HAD to read it!  I was a bit skeptical, as I thought it was a period piece.  Was I surprised!  Ms Hale combines a love for Jane Austen in a modern day setting.  I won't go into the actual plot, as I don't want to give too much away!  Just be assured that it is a clever, fast read, with a great cast of characters.  I am recommending this book to all my gal friends.<br /><br />As far as any other book that Ms. Hale has written, after researching this, I found that her other books to date were young adult or grammar school level.  I sure hope she writes some other adult reading level books.  Tally ho!

B0013ND30M|5.0|It has been over two decades since I last saw Disney's animated film SLEEPING BEAUTY. I was just a small child in elementary school when I first saw the film. Once again, Disney digs deep into their vault and re-releases the classic animated film as part of their platinum edition series. The two dvd set includes the remastered version of the film and a slew of bonus features that the family is sure to enjoy.<br /><br />The story of Aurora, princess to King Stefan, she is a welcomed into the kingdom with a lavished celebration. The infant is greeted by King Hubert and his son Prince Philip, whom Aurora is betrothed to marry later in life. Then Aurora is paid a visit by the three good fairies Fauna, Merryweather, and Flora. Flora and Fauna are able to bless the child with the gift of beauty and song but before Merryweather could bless the child, the evil witch Maleficent drops in unexpectedly. Displeased that her presence was not wanted at the celebration, Maleficent curses the child that she will die at the age of 16 with a single prick to her finger by a spindle. Thankfully Merryweather weakens the curse to simply a deep sleep. Reluctantly, King Steffan allows the three good fairies to take Aurora out of the kingdom until she is the age of 16, to protect Auroa from Maleficent's curse.<br /><br />As mere mortals, the three fairies raises Aurora as Briar Rose in the forest without raising a suspicion. In the meantime, Maleficent has her army (who are totally incompetent for comedic value) out searching for Aurora for 16 years. When she realizes her army's mistake of looking for a baby for 16 years, Maleficent sends out her pet raven Diablo to search for Aurora. With the assistance of the fairies, Prince Philip goes to rescue the princess who had fallen under the evil witch's spell.<br /><br />Everything you expect in a Disney animated film is there, song, comedy, drama, and a anti-climatic ending is here in the lavished remastered film. This was the first time I have seen SLEEPING BEAUTY since I was a child. I almost forgotten how good this film is. The colors in this new version is vibrant. The music is beautiful. The music in today's Disney animated films lacks the beauty and elegence of the classic Disney films like the orchestral score for SLEEPING BEAUTY.

B001E75QGG|2.0|This movie was poor for several reasons: getting geriatric harrison ford to star in this flick, bad continuity and just plain boring/totally unrealistic scenes.     Examples: as indy is in the train and the young guy rides next to it on his motorcycle, and presto, all of a sudden they are sitting in a restaurant?! i mean, even a beginner director would not make a cut like that.     in the chase scene through the university the bad guys windshield is destroyed by a statue's head, 2 seconds later the car is undamaged.     The car chase scene in the jungle. First of all, this scene was way to long, and no, jungles do not have nice smooth roadways through them (in the scene two cars are even parallel to each other. wow, a 2 lane jungle highway)     this was a sloppy, careless production mr. spielberg. as if just produced to make you a couple extra million for your kids or something. if this is all you are willing to produce from now on, save us the disappointments and go retire.
061861169X|4.0|Before you buy this book, consider whether your child has doubts about Santa Claus and how much you are going to let them in on the secret. This book may plant a seed of doubt that you may regret.<br /><br />This is the story of a boy who is swept away to the North Pole, gets to meet Santa and his elves, and receives a very special gift which he treasures his whole life. The gift is a sleighbell that rings for anyone who believes in Santa. His parents could never hear the ring. His sister one year didn't hear it ring anymore. And some of his friends never heard it ring either. But he, being taken face to face with Santa, always believes and therefore always hears it ring.<br /><br />But the flip side of the coin is that everyone else eventually stops believing. If your child is immersed in the tradition, then it may be too early to read the book to him. If your child is already clear on the subject, it might be too late. If your child is on the final step of finding out the truth, it might be a fantastic story to share with them to show how Santa exists for those who believe in him and there is no shame either in believing or disbelieving.<br /><br />The art is fantastic and the story is very well constructed. It's only problem is finding the right moment to lay this on your kid.

0060254920|4.0|Briefly, the story revolves around Max, a young boy who behaves naughtily and is sent to bed without supper. In his room, he is transported to another world \\"where the wild things are\\" where he is made king of the wild things. After having his fill of leading the wild things, he returns to his room to find his supper left on his dresser.    This story strikes an interesting balance between the real world of Max and his family and Max's dream world \\"where the wild things are\\". Whereas in the former world his actions are seen as naughty and are decried, the dream world provides Max not only with the ability to act in the way he wants but also to have those actions sanctioned and praised by those around him.    Beyond that, even, is the amount of control Max can exert in each world. The real world limits him and he is almost totally at the mercy of his parents who send him to his room. In the wild world, even before he becomes king of the wild things, he is able to control the other wild things and his power is unlimited. An interesting question to ask is whether Max would be as naughty as he is if he believed himself to have more power in the real world.    The conclusion of the story seems to come mostly as the author stumbles over himself to wrap up the story. It is unclear why the angry parents would reward Max's behavior or why they would negate the punishment meted out at the beginning of the story. I found the warm supper waiting for Max upon his return from the wild world to be somewhat out of place. I understand, perhaps, that even bad kids are loved and that may be the moral being taught here, but it is strange that Max just receives the food out of the blue with no remorse on his part.    The book is a fun story and holds the attention of my 3 year old. He loves when I improvise the roaring and gnashing. Throwing in a little Troggs \\"Wild Thing\\" during the rumpus makes story time a little bit more fun too. I don't think the strange lesson at the end ruins thestory, and I'm not sure that the target audience of this book would be able to figure it out in the first place. 4 stars for a fun book that holds kids' attentions.

It has a typical \\"personality\\" type assessment test, but instead of really giving you a great interesting test it was composed of a very simple, short test that took about 10 minutes. From that, Rath's website examines where your strengths are. My test was probably only 50% accurate. Don't buy the used copies, more than likely someone ha already used the code in the back of the book and then the book is virtually useless....geee, wonderful sales gimick! This type og general test taking to \\"Discover Your Strengths\\" is giving the world false impressions. Combined with a formula of Talent X Investment = Strength, Rath hopes that he can convince people to not waste their time if they have no natural talent for something. These types of books only want ot sell to the public and do not really offer much of any analysis.

0375701427|5.0|From reading through various reviews on here, I imagine my opinion on this book is shared by the majority but there are still many who disliked it very various reasons. I was born after all the events of the 40's, 50's, 60's, and seventies took place. This book was a giant eye-opener for me and taught me more than any textbook or college course. This was one of those books that so touched me personally, and helped me conceive of how my grandparent's moralistic generation warped into the mess of today, that I feel I will never recover from reading this book. For better or worse it has changed me. It may be the heaviest book I've ever read.
0894803123|5.0|I ordered this book along with my new Kitchen Aid ice cream maker.  The book is delightful, written with lots of humor and interesting stories of how Ben & Jerry started their business.  Oh, and the recipes are great too!  Really, there are some wonderful recipes in this little book.  I was concerned about using raw eggs.  I live in a very small Canadian town and was unable to get pasteurized eggs.  I went online to see what temperatures kill Salmonella and found that \\"storing below freezing will destroy most of the bacteria\\".  Most???  Sorry, not for my family.  I adapted the recipes to make a cooked custard first.  Most of these recipes have milk, sugar and eggs as a base.  Just whisk the sugar into the milk and whisk in the beaten eggs.  Cook over low to medium heat, stirring with a spatula constantly.  I used a candy thermometer and you should stop at 175 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.  The minute you see a boiling bubble, take it off the heat and whisk vigorously.  Cool the mixture in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, and whisk it about every 30 minutes until it is completely chilled. Then you add your cream and whatever else you are putting in and pour the whole thing into the ice cream maker. Voila!!  Perfect ice cream every time!! This book will also give you the motivation to invent your own flavors, as you will see that the base is, well, basic.  You will be limited only by your imagination!  Enjoy!

Be sure to let this CD play for a while before you give up.  Great CD to play in the car while you drive in rush hour traffic.

B000UFAURI|4.0|Foo Fighters made their big break in the 90's and disappeared for a while.  The band resurfaced with some albums but now it seems to have matured a bit.  Their songs have been polished and their tunes seem different and better.  Some great songs are \\"Let It Die\\", \\"Long Run to Ruin\\", and \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\" which have been played on the radio.  All other songs will take some time to appreciate and later will be favorites.
0375826726|2.0|This book is bogged down with lengthy passages and confusing descriptions. I am a good reader, and I often times could not understand what the place he was describing was meant to look like. Why?? Because of the way he writes.     \\"A web of white veins adorned the backside of the crags and pillars, where hoarfrost had collected in the cracks that furrowed the rock. Nothing else disturbed the gloom of Helgrind's inky, windswept ramparts. No trees grew there among the slanting stones, nor shrubs, nor grass, nor moss, nor lichen, nor did eagles dare nest upon the tower's broken ledges. True to its name, Helgrind was a place of death, and stood cloaked in the razor-sharp, sawtoothed folds of its scarps and clefts like a bony specter risen to haunt the earth.\\"    Now, don't get me wrong, if you read very carefully, you can get the image. But as eloquent as the home-schooled  Paolini believes he is, this is the most damn confusing read I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The character of Eragon, somehow, is extremely gifted and talented at fighting. But no one knows why. The only reason seems to be that he was CHOSEN to be a dragonrider. But no one knows why. He is not gifted. Paolini writes him as being rash and foolish and impulsive, but somehow he manages to be a wise and powerful warrior. This story has hardly any believable elements in it.     I liked Eragon. It had flaws, and at times I wanted to take a red pen to it, but I still enjoyed it. This book was slow and long. The descriptions were long, but they didn't help much. In any case, strike two for Paolini.     Eldest was just like this book in the way it was hard to read. That was strike one. Brisingr was strike two. Almost out Paolini.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|If you ever wondered what it might be like to be at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, this film is your best bet.<br /><br /> It is a long, careful, meticulous look, at a monumental event.  It is also extremely well balanced.  This is no Gung Ho propaganda film.  It shows equally how  skillfully the Japanese caught the U.S. off guard, how ill prepared the U.S. was for the attack, and how bravely the American servicemen tried to make the best of a horrible reality.  It keenly illustrates the ironic tragedy, where Japan is victorious in battle, but ultimately loses the war. The battle scenes, despite their intensity and  fury, give only a hint of the carnage both sides were to suffer in the course of the conflict.<br /><br /> As more time passes, and the veterans (both Japanese and American) are lost to us, I doubt that there will be another movie made about this attack.  If there is, it will have to go a long way to best Tora, Tora, Tora.
0805066691|5.0|I have known about Dee Brown's classic history of the Western Indian Wars, for some thirty-five years. I can remember it being discussed, when I was in Middle School, between the years 1971 and 1974. Adults would mention it. You heard them talk about it on the radio, and on TV. This was about the time that Marlon Brando refused his Oscar for The Godfather, in protest of the treatment of Native Americans by the government.<br /><br />It was very much talked about at the time.<br /><br />Finally, years later, I picked up the book and began reading it. Not only was it in my list of books on American History that I want to read, but recently, it fits into my passion for understanding the history of my own family. My great-great grandmother, Mattie Clemons, was a Creek or Choctaw Indian from Alabama. She was very likely the illegitimate child of a white man named Clemons and an unidentified Native American woman. As a very young girl, perhaps three or for years old, I believe that she was forced west in the Trail of Tears. She spent her life hiding her Indian identity, seeking to blend in with the whites. This rejection of her Creek/Choctaw heritage was passed on to the next one or two generations, and only recently have we begun searching for answers.<br /><br />For people like me, books like Bury My Heart provide some answers. Our ancestors, that lived only 150 years ago, have vanished into historical thin air. Records are few. Their names are not known. But thankfully, Dee Brown gives us more than perhaps we realize at first glance. I may not know the names, or the places, of my Native American ancestors. But I know more about their lifesyle, and what happened to them, than I do of even my Polish great-grandparents on the other side!<br /><br />The book is shocking, saddening, sickening, enlightening, and riveting. It is peppered with occasional comic moments, mostly at the expense of the white idiots that dominated the formulation of Indian policy. Our heroes on one side of the American History tome: Jackson, Grant, Sheridan, Sherman, and Schurz, are transformed into near Nazi-like villains on the other.<br /><br />This mixed bag of human nobility and shame makes the story of Wounded Knee authentically American.<br /><br />I will never forget some of the book's moments: Of a visit to Chicago by one chief, who noted that the whites tended to go back and forth, hurriedly, like ants, with no particular purpose except to keep on the move; of Chief Joseph's comments about schools and church (he didn't want churches because all they did was taught you how to argue about God); of one chief handing to an Indian Bureau agent a handful of dirt, saying \\"Here, take this - it is all that's left of our land\\"; of the Indian Messiah that ushered in the Ghost Dance movement, and generated hope that the Indians would make a comeback; of the final massacre at Wounded Knee, where women and children were slaughtered along with the adult males.<br /><br />The Indian Wars were a shameful chapter in American History. I would argue, with my grandfather, that our horrible treatment of the Indians surpassed even that of the African American slaves. Most likely both are on a par.<br /><br />American policy was to make the Indians into white people. But those that did, by converting to Christianity and building houses and farms, still were forced onto reservations.<br /><br />I would recommend this troubling book to any that have not yet read it. We still can, and should, learn much from our Native American brothers and sisters. And if we can have a hand in reviving all that was noble and decent in their culture, it would be a good thing.e: Jackson, Grant, Sheridan, Sherman, and Schurz, are transformed into near Nazi-like villains on the other.

B000FPFCJ4|5.0|So how am I expected to speak objectively about this album? I don't get it. I've loved it for seven years now. It's true that there's absolutely no reason for this to be a two-hour double album - \\"Love's In Need of Love Today\\", \\"Ordinary Pain\\", \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", \\"Joy Inside My Tears\\", \\"Black Man\\", \\"As\\" and \\"Another Star\\" are only made as long as they are because of their codas. But I wouldn't trade any of those codas for anything.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe two minutes of students and teachers shouting at each other at the end of \\"Black Man\\" is a bit over-the-top, but even then I gotta give Stevie my props for pulling something that daring and that avant-garde. Besides, the first six minutes are sociopolitical funk at its best. And while on an objective basis the funky ending to \\"Ordinary Pain\\" is annoying, it makes perfect sense in context of the song! It makes it feel like a conversation between two people. The part sung by Stevie is from the perspective of someone who's sad about the breakup, while the part sung by that woman is someone angry at the guy and happy about the breakup. And while the melancholy piano ballad section is by far the best of the two, it just wouldn't feel complete without the ending. \\"Love's in Need of Love Today\\" and \\"Joy Inside My Tears\\" are worth their lengths because you get to hear Stevie belt, \\"Another Star\\" is perfectly fine being eight and a half minutes long because of all the fantastic solos, and \\"As\\" justifies its length with the solos (ooh! Organ!), the total change of pace (morphing into gritty funk temporarily), and because of the Stevie belting coda. And you think I'm gonna ask him to take off the end of \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", arguably the ultimate expression of joy on any record ever made? As I'm sure you well know, it's Stevie playing his harmonica as a backdrop for his baby daughter crying and \\"talking\\" and being curious and cute and all. It's amazing.<br /><br />Of course, any of these songs could've functioned as three-minute pop songs - in fact, \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" was a pretty big hit - but then they just wouldn't feel complete. In fact, it makes me wish that several other songs received similar treatments! For instance, what if he had expanded on the dueling horns of \\"I Wish\\"? Or that build-up at the end of \\"Pastime Paradise\\" when the chorus singing in Hindu gets louder and more intense? Or that organ solo at the end of \\"Summer Soft\\"? Or simply repeated the chorus of \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\" for several minutes? It works fantastically on the other songs, especially \\"As\\", which is my favorite song on the record because of the coda, when the chorus gets repeated and repeated and repeated while the organ and the acoustic guitar square it off and the drummer kicks total butt. Oh, and Herbie Hancock plays keyboards on it. I shouldn't have to tell you how awesome that is.<br /><br />And that's just half the album. The short songs all add a lot. \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\" is a fantastic, deceptively complex love song with an amazing chorus... and it's performed entirely by Stevie. \\"Sir Duke\\" is a fantastic big-band/funk hybrid with some of the best horns in Stevie's history, \\"I Wish\\" is just as good as its obvious model, \\"Superstition\\", and maybe a little better; \\"Pastime Paradise\\" is a haunting Eastern-influenced meditation on injustice with some of the best lyrics on that record,  \\"Summer Soft\\" is better than all of the cheesy soft rock it set out to imitate and it's again got a great, if short coda, \\"Ngiculela/Es Una Historia/I Am Singing\\" is a good Brazilian track, far better than most give it credit for; \\"Saturn\\" is a naïve but beautiful song about world peace, and honestly I love the message, \\"Ebony Eyes\\" is an awesomely fun love song, \\"All Day Sucker\\"  is one of his best funk songs, and \\"Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call)\\" shows that nobody could beat this guy on harmonica.<br /><br />Sure, there's a bit of filler, but you know why I'm perfectly fine with that? For one, I get the sense this is a concept album about life and love, and neither of those things are perfect. So why should an album about such topics be? For another, the filler isn't filler in the traditional, tossed-off-to-round-out-the-album sense - they're all carefully written, produced, and arranged filler. \\"Have a Talk with God\\" and \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" don't blow my mind or anything, but it's clear a lot of effort was put into them (though the first has one cool synthesizer part). Especially \\"Have a Talk with God\\", which uses overdubbed vocals and synthesizers. You know why I think they were worked hard on? Because Stevie's the only musician who appears on either track! For a third, they add to the scope of the album (especially the baroque \\"Village Ghetto Land\\"), and for a fourth, the whole thing would just seem incomplete without, say, the gentle \\"If It's Magic\\" or the smooth instrumental \\"Contusion\\". I don't know why, but they just would.<br /><br />You need to hear this album straight through, start to finish, just for all the effort put into the arranging, producing, writing, and performing of the album.

But if you played it, and then played the original, you'd probably find yourself liking the original more.<br /><br />Sadly, this marked the end of Stevie's most prolific era - while all the work he put into this project certainly paid off, I'm also willing to bet it wore him out, which is why his proceeding releases came so slowly.

1400064287|5.0|Excellant book to read.  Well written.  Great lessons for learing to present that unique idea you want to stick customers' minds.
B00007E8SW|5.0|This is not a good album. It is not a great album. It is not a fantastic, magnificent, or wonderful album. I don't think those words are enough for it. I listen to this album quite often, but I don't have to. It's playing in my head all the time. I don't even know if \\"album\\" is the proper terminology here - despite my staunch agnostic beliefs, I consider it more of a spiritual experience. A Love Supreme is Coltrane's masterwork, a stunning three-part suite devoted to God. Over the course of his illustrious, all-too-brief career, Coltrane made many superlative albums, be it the \\"sheets of sound\\" blues on Giant Steps, the traditionalist triumph My Favorite Things, the introspective Coltrane's Sound, or the mind-blowing free jazz experiments found on The Major Works of John Coltrane. But this album outstrips all of them. Simply put, it's an uncomparable work of art.<br /><br />This marks the end of an era for Coltrane. From the time he captured the imaginations of jazz fans worldwide via his stunning work with Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, as well as the many classic albums of his early career (see Blue Train, Lush Life and Soultrane), he was arguably the most respected saxophone of his generation. This would be his last album to receive universal acclaim, the last to be widely recognized as a classic even today. Shortly after this album came out, Coltrane would take his music into a new, controversial direction: free jazz. Albums like Meditations and the powerful pieces collected on The Major Works of John Coltrane were less than conventional, making art and beauty out of chaos to convey the unrest of the late '60s. However, not everybody understood these albums for what they were, and they remain begging for reexamination.<br /><br />However, most agree that A Love Supreme as the peak. Whether he would go off the deep end immediately afterwords or continue making fantastic music is a matter of personal preference and is irrelevant to this review.<br /><br />The album begins with a cascade of notes coming from Coltrane's sax, followed by a simple four-note bass theme that is repeated throughout the album. Coltrane solos over this theme, and his playing reflects the full specturm of human emotions, from joy to rage and everywhere in between. He often dances around the theme himself, adding embellishments wherever he deems appropriate. When the solo ends, he switches to chanting the title. This is followed by a brief bass solo.<br /><br />This solo leads into the second part, \\"Resolution,\\" the most fiery track on the album. A vaguely Eastern melody is established, then destroyed as Coltrane shoots fireworks out of his saxophone, dredging his demons through music. But perhaps the best part of the entire record is McCoy Tyner's piano solo, where he upstages Coltrane - a hard task, considering the quality of Trane's solo. But hey, it's McCoy Tyner, you know?<br /><br />After \\"Resolution\\" comes a lengthy but captivating drum solo, which ushers in \\"Pursuance.\\" Once again, Coltrane is incorporating elements of world music into his melodies. This time the sound is European. The song closes with a long, but once again fascinating and lyrical, bass solo with shades of Charles Mingus in it. On vinyl pressings of this album, \\"Pursuance\\" flows directly into \\"Psalm\\" as if the two were one song. \\"Psalm\\" ends the album on an appropriately dramatic note - as it comes to a close, drummer Elvin Jones incorporates tympani and cymbal rolls. It is also the album's most experimental piece. Coltrane's melody here is the meter of a poem he wrote, dedicated to God, and included in the album's liner notes. Since the poem is set to an atypical meter, one could almost see this as a direct predecessor to free jazz. It creates the illusion of Coltrane reading the poem passionately through his saxophone, and it is a beautiful way to end a beautiful album.<br /><br />I've written about seven hundred words about this album already, and I could probably write seven hundred more before I even scratched the surface of this true work of art. Words really aren't enough. The music speaks for itself. It's one of those rare things that can honestly inspire a sense of reverence in me. Nothing is sacred to me. Nothing, except for A Love Supreme.rface of this true work of art. Words really aren't enough. The music speaks for itself.

B00008DDSC|4.0|I'M YOUR SECRETARY! I'M YOUR SECRETARY! Punishingly funny. Sick, disturbing, entertainingly silly comedy. From subtle, to heavy-handed, to unpredictable.<br /><br />You're not sure if you want to like, hate, or pity the main characters; Mr Grey (James Spader - Stargate, The Practice, Boston Legal) or Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal - Donnie Darko, The Dark Knight). But there are some outrageous scenes that make up for the somewhat (ahem) sick sexual practices that the boss and secretary go through.<br /><br />Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan, Solaris, Rescue Dawn), as Lee's spaced-out boyfriend Peter, lends welcomed comic relief to some pretty dark and painful scenes (pun intended).<br /><br />This movie is definitely not for the straight-laced; even though you've got to keep reminding yourself \\"It's only a movie.\\"  Not be be taken seriously. The tomato throwing scene was priceless.
B0002ZEZJ0|5.0|God, I hope I never posted my older review of this album on here amazon.com or anything. It sucks! See, here's how it goes. I write a few sentences on-topic, then I'm off yelling at the general critical establishment for overrating it, then I abruptly switch to talking about Columbian drug lords. Next thing you know, I'm on a completely new tangent about how bad Foreigner is. I'm only spending half the time talking about the music, too.<br />Such a travesty will not occur during this review, though. I do think that, while it's definitely the Clash's second-best album, and while it's packed with important hits, and that there's only one bad song on it (\\"The Card Cheat\\", which is totally overblown), that it's a bit overrated. I mean, I've seen so much praise for it, and I don't quite agree with it.<br />But it's good! Really, really good! The reggae stuff is especially fantastic: \\"Wrong 'em Boyo\\" is a bouncy good time; \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" is a druggy, ominous protest; \\"Revolution Rock\\" has an exceptional horn part; and \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" is probably the most fun you'll have on this album. Reggae even creeps into the title track's time-bomb syncopation. But there's more than just reggae. This is one diverse album, you see! There' s jazz (\\"Jimmy Jazz\\"). There's rock (title track ; \\"Clampdown\\", my favorite besides \\"Guns of Brixton\\"; \\"Spanish Bombs\\", \\"Death or Glory\\"; \\"Four Horsemen\\"; \\"I'm Not Down\\"). There's disco (\\"Lost in the Supermarket\\", yet another in a long line of fantastic songs). There's pure pop (\\"Train in Vain (Stand By Me)\\", a deserved breakthrough single). There's rockabilly (\\"Brand New Cadillac\\") And then there's some of the stuff you really can't pin down: \\"Hateful\\", \\"The Right Profile\\", \\"Lover's Rock\\", \\"Koka Kola\\".<br />It would be insane to discuss all these songs in detail, since there's nineteen of them (Ironically, I think I went into some detail about every song on my review of the triple-album Sandinista!), but let me go over some favorites: the famous apocalyptic title track; \\"Jimmy Jazz\\", because it's so weird and unpredictable; \\"Spanish Bombs\\", with a great melody and some lame Spanglish; \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\", containing some of the most poignant lyrics ever; \\"Clampdown\\", containing some of the most vicious anti-fascist lyrics ever; \\"Death or Glory\\", which actually lashes out at the very same punk movement the Clash themselves had helped establish; \\"Train in Vain\\", proving that the Clash could write a good pop song, and everything that's even remotely connected to reggae. And \\"Four Horsemen\\" too, I guess, although it does sound a bit too arena-rockish to me. It's good arena-rock, though, and that's a very rare thing.<br />So does this live up to the hype? I don't think so, but that's not the fault of the album. It's the fault of the hype. I also think it's cool how this pressing is a two-disc version rather than a one-disc version.

B00003CXDB|5.0|I'm not going to repeat all the accolades already given this movie. But one glaring miscast as having also been mentioned before - Daryl Hannah as Darien Taylor, was absolutely horrible in this film. I agree that Sean Young (Kate Gekko) should have switched parts with Hannah.<br /><br />Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko and Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox were excellent. The very touching scene between Bud and his dad Carl (Martin Sheen) in the hospital was one of the more memorable in this great movie.

Delta Sgt. 1st Class 'Hoot Gibson' (Eric Bana - Munich, Hulk, Lucky You, Troy) and Ranger 'SSgt. Matt Eversmann' (Josh Hartnett - Lucky Number Slevin, Sin City, The Black Dahlia) do \\"bang-up\\" jobs in this story of the bloody battle in \\"The Mog.\\"<br /><br />Great contributions from William Fitchner (HEAT, Invasion, Prison Break, The Dark Knight) as Delta Sgt 1st Class Jeff Sanderson, Jason Isaacs (Resident Evil, Harry Potter, The State Within) as the by-the-book Ranger Capt.

Whereas, American actors hardly ever come through with convincing foreign accents. Case(s) in point: Ewan McGregor as Specialist Grimes, Jason Isaacs as Capt. Steele, Ewen Bremner as Spec. Sgt. Nelson, Orlando Bloom as Pvt. Todd Blackburn and Bana as Hoot. All handling their American accents with excellence during the entire movie. You just couldn't tell they are \\"foreigners.\\"<br /><br />The detail of the weaponry used was good; especially the Black Hawks with mini-guns and the \\"Little Birds\\" with mini-guns and 7-shot rocket pods. With the excepting of one screen shot from above the \\"Little Bird\\" gunships, showing a Huey instead. A few other script continuity miscues, but mostly unnoticed by the technically deficient (for want of a more descriptive term). As previously mentioned, literally non-stop action of all the units involved in this undertaking.<br /><br />You'll notice future television stars such as Carmine Giovanazzo (CSI: NY) as Ranger Sgt.

What makes this movie the 2nd best movie I've ever seen is the fact that it was very very very well done in a very very very smart story that thins adrenaline in everyone that believes what we live now is a hoax made by governments to deceive people and have the ruled the way the government wants.<br /><br />A MUST BUY (not only watch). You'll be watching it over and over and over again!<br /><br />Hope people would learn from such movie how to get their freedom, not necessarily by violent but by being free from fears and able to take decisions by themselves and reason, not by fear and illusions.

B0015FML06|5.0|In 1983, I had just turned 16 years old, and this concert was my introduction to U2. It was one of those unforgettable musical moments that still holds a special place for me. What a great, simple, pure, and innocent time this was! There were no small cars hanging from the rafters, huge video screens, or giant lemons. It was just a great, uplifting rock n' roll concert.  The DVD is great. It captures everything nicely. Yes, even the red lines from the camera tube burn in. But, that was just how it was filmed. The packaging is very well done. I wish there would have been some current commentary/memories about the show from the band themselves. It is always great when artists look back, and we see their reaction when they look at some old footage. Wonder what Bono would say about his hair?  Finally, I still own the original cassette tape \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" from 1983 that has the unedited version of \\"Electric Co\\" with the \\"Send In The Clowns\\" reference. A couple of years later, I bought the CD, with the hacked up edit included. I agree with the other reviewer, on the CD, the edit in \\"Electric Co\\" sounds like a mistake. It makes me cringe when I hear it. I am usually against editing anything the artists put forth. After all these years, no agreement could have been reached to put the edit back in?  Couldn't Bono have used his political power of persuasion to get it done? It is ironic, because I believe that the part that is edited out is actually the scene used for the cover of \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\". The DVD version of \\"Electric Co\\", on the other hand, is perfectly done. The edit overlaps the solo to the next verse beautifully. I watched it again, and I still can't tell where the actual edit is, it is that flawless. Despite all that, this is the DVD that I have been waiting a long time for, and am very happy with the whole package. Even after 25 years, this performance is still a treasure, Thanks U2!
B0013ND36G|4.0|With two highly successful entries, the Terminator franchise seemed to suddenly hit a standstill when trying to get a second sequel off the ground to follow-up the events of \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\". Throughout the nineties, writer/director James Cameron (\\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\") touted numerous times that a third film would be on the way; however, never once were one of these proclamations followed by any substantial proof of a sequel actually being in the works. Finally, after many years of back and forth, the next installment in the series began production in 2002, but this time James Cameron was not involved, nor was actress Linda Hamilton who had portrayed Sarah Connor in the first two movies. Taking over for Cameron was director Jonathan Mostow (\\"U-571\\"), and with all the shifts within cast and crew some worried that perhaps Arnold would stick to his original statement that he would not return for \\"T3\\" if James Cameron didn't. For some reason, Arnold didn't stick to his guns, which was probably a fortunate decision for the sake of this film, and the actor was ready to take on his fellow machines once more, alongside Nick Stahl as John Connor (replacing Edward Furlong), in \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\".    \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" takes place approximately 10 years after the previous movie, and John Connor (Nick Stahl) is living out his life in fear that one day the dreaded events of the prophesied \\"Judgment Day\\" would still occur. Soon John begins to wonder if all his worries have been in vain, when a new threat from the future, a super-advanced Terminator identified simply as T-X (aka Terminatrix), arrives in the present day to eliminate all of the high ranking members of the human resistance before they are allowed to join forces against Skynet. Around this time, John encounters a former childhood friend named Kate Brewster (Claire Danes); however, this reunion could be cut short if the T-X has her way. To attempt to prevent the T-X's success, the resistance has once more sent back a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) of their own assigned to protect all those on the T-X hit list before it's too late.    With so many difficulties plaguing this sequel prior to it beginning production in 2002, I'm sure many wondered if there was even a need to continue the series; especially with writer/director James Cameron opting out of the project. If the series' mastermind isn't willing to return for a third go-round, what possible good could come with pursuing the movie anyways? Apparently, this kind of logical thinking didn't enter into the minds of the people at Warner Brothers, and based on the final product of \\"T3\\" I would have to say that avoiding that kind of thinking paid off rather well for the most part.    Regarding James Cameron's replacement, Jonathan Mostow, he was given the unenviable job of following up two highly successful and extremely well-respected movies in the realm of sci-fi. Not to mention following behind arguably one of the best director's in modern cinema. I have to say that barring a few gripes, Mostow's \\"T3\\" holds up well, but does fall just a tad shy of its predecessors. Jonathan's previous film, the World War II submarine action/drama \\"U-571\\", most likely prepared him to handle large scale action sequences, and gripping drama that deals with the fate of many people's lives hanging in the balance. So, as far as replacements go, I think that Warner Brothers left the series in extremely capable hands.    Due to James Cameron not returning for this entry, two new writers were brought onboard to pen the script for Arnold's third outing as the leather-clad killing machine. Writers John Brancato (\\"The Net\\") and Michael Ferris (\\"Catwoman\\") co-wrote the screenplay borrowing heavily from other Terminator related sources, such as; the concepts of a female Terminator and Judgment Day being postponed from the novel T2: Infiltrator, and taking some cues from a previous script written by Tedi Serafian that included Sarah dying of cancer a few years after \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\". Even with the less-than original ideas, John and Michael still delivered a tight script that boasted plenty of fast-paced action, and finally pushed the series closer to the futuristic events that we have only seen glimpses of in the previous movies. One somewhat disappointing aspect to the story of \\"T3\\" is that the movie feels like there is less going on here than in the previous two films. The first movie was essentially this two hour cat-and-mouse game between the Terminator and Sarah and Reese; the second one had a similar feel, but also had so much other stuff going on that the film was just incredibly rich with storytelling. However, in this third movie the story, although solid, didn't seem to have as much drama and actual plot going on as the first two movies had, which may explain why the action sequences were bigger, and possibly more frequent in this movie than the previous ones.    One area of these films that has improved significantly from movie to movie is the visual effects. In the first movie, \\"The Terminator\\", the effects were good for their time, although incredibly dated by today's standards; in \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" the special effects were given a major boost by the advent of CGI. So, twelve years after the release of \\"T2\\", one can easily say the capabilities of today's visual effects wizards are nothing short of astonishing. Therefore, it really comes as no surprise that for \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" the numerous effects sequences were obviously the best in the series' history, but also were some of the best of the year 2003.    Lastly, the cast of \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" was mostly impressive, maintaining the high standards the series had held since it began back in 1984. Arnold Schwarzenegger (\\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\") was a surprise to me, because so much time had passed since his time as the Terminator that I wondered if he could physically get back in shape for the role at his age, and with his interest in politics beginning to eat up more of his time. Surprisingly, Arnold pulled it all off, and aside from a few possible extra wrinkles he appeared to look virtually the same as he had back in 1991, which served the continuity of the series very well I might add. From an acting standpoint, after two previous movies, I believe Arnold knows this character inside and out, so for him there wasn't anything new to work with, most likely he just wanted to do it for the fans of the series. Plus, what would a Terminator movie be without Arnold somewhere in sight? Regarding the remainder of the cast, Claire Danes was a good choice for Kate Brewster, John's childhood friend, she brought a kind of toughness and a slight leadership quality that somewhat made up for the absence of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. Newcomer Kristanna Loken (\\"Bloodrayne\\") was a nice addition as the lethal femme fatale model of Terminator known as T-X or Terminatrix as she was sometimes referred; and she is easily the most dangerous, and attractive, of all the Terminator villains we've seen so far.    Out of the entire cast I only had one problem with one of the main members, and by this time you have probably figured out who I'm talking about, by looking at whom I haven't discussed yet. You guessed it, actor Nick Stahl (\\"Sin City\\") as John Connor was a major problem for me in this movie. As an actor I think Nick has done a good job in the various roles I have seen him in over the years; however, I for one don't believe he was a great choice to play John this close to the period in his life where he may possibly be called upon to lead humanity in its darkest hours. I thought that Nick made John seem far too whiny with his whole poor pitiful me routine that he kept using over and over throughout the movie. I kind of felt like for the future leader of mankind, I surewouldn't follow this loser into battle; honestly, he kind of seemed like Anakin Skywalker in \\"Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones\\", where he was constantly whining about Obi-Wan and the council holding him back from greatness. The difference being, here John wasn't seeking greatness, he just wanted to runaway and hide somewhere like a coward; although I must admit that around the midpoint of the movie, John does take a more proactive stance and begins to show signs that perhaps the leader that has been prophesied about may yet exist.    After watching all three Terminator films back-to-back over an incredibly fun Saturday, I have to say that while \\"T3\\" is still a highly entertaining entry into the series; it is the weakest one out of the three. The story is fast-paced, but feels at times to be a little weaker due to not nearly as much going on as there was in \\"T2\\"; the action sequences were fun and on occasion were flat-out impressive to watch, and of course the visual effects were the best in the series. However, the slightly weaker story, coupled with a questionable performance from Nick Stahl as a semi-weak acting John Connor, and a few possible continuity errors between this movie and the previous ones made \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" not quite as good as either of the previous films in the series.    \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|The only way this DVD could be better is if it had more discs so make sure you buy the 2 DVD version.<br />If you are a fan of any of the performers here you cannot go wrong.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The marvelous film The Illusionist was released in 2006 to reasonable success at the box office. But its art house feel and understated (and excellent)acting apparently appealed to only so many people. It did not make great play with the media and was not splashed across the covers of magazines, with the possible exception of celebrity gossip circles for the youthful Jessica Biel. Even an ardent viewer of films such as myself missed this one at the theater.<br /><br />So, seeing this film two years later on DVD, with little or no fanfare, only added to my pleasure at finding this gem. Director and screen writer Neil Burger effortlessly presents a cat and mouse detective mystery against the backdrop of turn of the century Vienna.  Edward Norton, who plays Eisenheim the Illusionist, and Paul Giamatti, who plays Inspector Uhl, both aptly demonstrate their exceptional acting skill and range.<br /><br />A must see.
B00000I07P|2.0|Slippery When Wet some think its the greatest album of all time but personally i think its just one of those albums you can just pass on as nothing. Whats so special about, \\"Let It Rock\\", oooh so they used synth and guitar and just played one note and than bon jovi's singing comes in who cares. The reason i give it two stars is because its okay i guess i mean livin on a prayer and wanted dead or alive is okay but besides that its too glammy. not great not good

B000000OPZ|1.0|How bad is this. During the late 80s the whole big hair thing and ballad thing was the new and everyone loved it. Whitesnake compared too great bands of that era(metallica or guns n roses), is nothing compared too them. Sure they wrote Here I Go Again but all that is is just another power ballad that was so over used that era. Every single song Whitesnake pretty much has ever writtien is a freaking ballad i mean sure one or two songs but the whole album? come on. Way too much synth and ballads too be called a metal album. It just doesent work Here i Go Again isnt even that good and Is THis Love is the worse song of all time. Dont buy horrible band horrible album would give zero starts. By far not the greatest album of all time in fact its one of the worse
0786186291|5.0|My parents had been trying to get me to read this series for a number of years.  I tried once or twice, but whether it was the wrong time or I was in the wrong mood, I just couldn't get into the characters.  I then was in a position of driving, alone, from New York to Texas, and stopped in a bookstore for something to listen to on the way.      First, the Master and Commander that I listened to was not Simon Vance.  Happily it was well enough done to make me continue the series.  At this writing, I have 3 and 1/2 books left.  Simon Vance is so good though, that I am purchasing his version, of this, the first book.  I also had ordered, without checking, the last book.  When I received it from the used seller, and discovered that it was read by someone else, I dropped that in the charity bag, and ordered another with Mr. Vance.  He does not intrude on the story, but he is definitely a part of the family.  I couldn't imagine finishing up with anyone else.    I have not done any more long car trips, but have listened piece meal during day to day driving.  The story holds up, and I have spent quite a bit of time sitting in the driveway \\"just finishing up a bit\\"  I always keep the next book ready in the car.    There are many reviews of the books, probably much better than I could set out.  I was not an audio book listener until we listened to the Harry Potter books, read by Jim Dale, on a number of long car drives.  (The last one on the drive that got me to New York from Texas).  I had tried several other books, including favorites of mine, and really have decided that the reader makes all of the difference.  I have listened to books that I love, and not been able to finish them, because the reader just didn't get the material.  Simon Vance gets this material.    I have added the paper books to my library and will read them the old fashioned way some day.  These CDs will stay in my permanent library as well.  They certainly match the gold standard of \\"re-readability\\".
B000EQ47GS|3.0|Boston another one of those \\"stadium rock\\" bands from the 70s that now a days are long broken up and or not touring and currently realising skimpy hits complimation cds for low prices(8.97, 6.97 or lower) anyways  Boston's debut album is probaly there best album and the only one you need of them. Huge success when it came out and is one of those great debut albums that are hard too find but people look whats better, Are You Experienced by The Jimi Hendrix Experience a classic great rock album or Bostons first album. Puh leeze people come on and please comment on this review if you disagree otherwise. These guys had a few hits that are still popular today, \\"More Than A Feeling\\", etc. Over all a good album buy today
0312427999|5.0|The best thing about this book is that neither the book nor its author will ever be dismissed as another case of conspiracy-mania - it is so well built, researched and argumented. In my mind, it obviously follows in the steps of \\"The Prince\\" by Machiavelli, since it says not what men should do but what they are actually doing (I am paraphrasing somebody else's praise of Machiavelli's work). For this reason, I believe that this book is a must read for anyone interested in serious understanding of modern politics.  I was tempted though to rate the book not with five but with four stars. I admired the exposure - sometimes even painful to read - of the latest techniques developed by the richest interests in modern powerplays. But I did not find any clear recognition of the fact that society at both national and international levels has to have a rightful place for these interests, since they are an integral part of it. Nor did I see any ideas about a reasonable way forward and a means for other parts of society to engage these rich and powerful interests - in a truly democratic way; that is, ways and means which will allow us to prevent all the worst effects of, and to keep in check greed-driven disaster-capitalistic policies, while at the same time respecting all the democratically legitimate rights of the super-rich who are and, I am convinced, will always be an indispensable and useful part of any modern society - if it is to be free.  How does modern free and democratic society develop media, think tanks, etc, that would be on a par with those put in place by the super-rich?  How does it organise a political action that would be as well staffed and run - and as efficient?  These - and many others - are the very tough questions to be answered. Without answers to them, books like this one hurt us - as they should - but don't provide much help.
B00197U0DU|5.0|From Genesis To Revelation is just one of those albums... That will never be realesed again nothing like this is on the cd shelves right now but personally compared too some of the 80s \\"pop music video 80s\\" Genesis that everyone is aware of and knows of and or the Phil Collins era Genesis i personally like this stuff the most and i will explain why. Back when this came out Phil Collins nor Tony Hackett were in the band and the band consisted of a few other members and Peter Gabirel. \\"From Genesis To Revelation\\" Is a very poetic album and accoustic but the songs are really good and is almost pscyhedelic in a way and its main focus is \\"The Beginning\\", which they often sing about on this. Really good album great songs i currently own a tape of this called, \\"In The Beggining\\", with the same songs except less. Some key tracks on here are, \\"Where The Sour Turns To Sweet\\", \\"In The Beginning\\", and \\"The Serpent\\", great album essential for anyone obsessed with stuff like Pink Floyd and Yes, buy today
B001H65HGS|5.0|This show is great, especially if you're a fan of tv shows like The Sopranos.  Having said that, be aware of what you're getting into--there is swearing, but, much like The Sopranos, the characters are so fascinating that you don't care about the vulgarity.  If anything, it makes it seem more realistic.  This show has given me a completely different perspective on things I had never thought a lot about.  I especially love that a woman--the character Gemma--is playing a leading role when crime dramas typically only showing men as part of the action.  The part is played wonderfully, and to be honest I don't have any idea what the one-star reviewer is talking about.  Give it a chance and watch the first episode because it will probably hook you in.  If you can't stand swearing, vulgarity, and violence, go watch everybody loves raymond.

B001C3KCSY|4.0|One thing is for sure, KOL are a tight band, with the kind of mental telepathy sibling acts have. Whatever nitch they fall into (\\"southern boogie rock\\"?), and whatever their influences, there was a fresh is-what-it-is quality to their sound. Now that they're being groomed for success(quite literally, if you've seen their new 'doos), some of what nature and nurture gave them is being airbrushed away. (Strangely, the more I understand singer Caleb Followill's words, the less I like the music.) With Only By the Night it's almost as if the country boys have come to the city for the first time, seen the competition and think they need to change in order to measure up. It's a matter of innocence lost, and hopefully they'll stay true to themselves no matter how they \\"progress\\" as musicians. I like the new album, but fear for their future. In any case, they gave me three memorable albums in a row and that's a rarity.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I've been around a long time and heard almost all of them. This is the best for a number of reasons:    1) Steven Wilson  2) Porcupine Tree, damn they are great and Gavin is a killer, listen to this version of Hate Song.  3) DTS version, if you have it or know someone who does, listen there  4) best song writing going out there now, the world is full of crap now, but this you must hear.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|The music, the visuals . . . this movie is simply a masterpiece.  But more than that, it may be the only movie that truly captured the innocence of those times.  I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area during the  late sixties and witnessed the Summer of Love as well as the war protests at Berkeley, tear gas, ranks of police and all!  The songs of the Beatles were the soundtrack of my teens, and I remember witnessing the civil rights riots, participating in peace marches, debating fiercely with classmates, but even more so with my parents who could not understand why their perfect daughter had become such a rebel and talked treason!  My generation wanted to make a positive difference in the world so badly, and with total innocence, we set out to do what we could.  Like Lucy, we pitched in where we could.  We did not understand why adults were so angry or why the police and National Guard were called out to stop us.  We simply wanted justice and peace in the world.  What an amazing place and time that was to be young and alive!  This movie really took me back to those days and how much we wanted to change the world and make it a better place, and how willing we were to take action and speak out.

031606792X|3.0|I love the Twilight Saga. I adore this book series. When I first read twilight, I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one day. Then I read it 5 more times in one week. New Moon was wonderful too. When Edward left Bella, I cried. It was such a sad thing. Maybe a little over the top, but it was still good. Eclipse was also a good book. It introduced alot of issues, like the jacob bella issue, and the whole when Bella would become a vampire. All in all, I LOVED these three books. When I read Breaking Dawn, I didn't know what to think. Now I realize that Breaking Dawn was more of a disapointment for me. I liked the story line, But I agree with alot of things that I have read in other reviews.     Yes, I know that the book series is fantasy, that anything can happen because they are not real. But the whole point is, is that they have things that ARE real in them. I agree that I do not know what teen would be excited that they were pregnant. Bella has a totally illogical response to being pregnant. She is excited. She didn't want to marry Edward, let alone have a baby. So when her heart is full of joy at the thought, it confuses me.     Another thing that I didn't really like was how Bella got everything that she wanted. Don't get me wrong, I'm am very happy that she got the things she wanted. But the ending was like any other fairy tale. It was boring and bland. This story did not evoke the same feelings for me as the other books did.     Another thing that I agree with, is that the author totally cut off the relationship with Bella. I can honestly say that in this book, I didn't really understand Bella that much. I lost sight of who she was. It made me sad that I couldn't really relate to her that much. The author told you what the feelings she had, but you couldn't fell those feelings. I might as well have read a science report describing a rock.     All in all, this book was not what I had hoped it would be. I am happy that Bella got things that she wanted. I still like the twilight series, I have just lost some respect for the series. Twilight will remain my favorite book, because it isn't as fake as the others. Happy reading :)
0440237688|4.0|This book was great for a few reasons...<br /><br />Theme - a utopian society will always be relevant and always be thought provoking. Especially when its well written like The Giver is. I find the theme to be incredibly interesting, especially since I have only ever read one other similar novel which was 1984.<br /><br />Size and syle - It was short, very easy to read and follow. The thing I liked about it is that even though its technically a young adult novel, it can be read by all ages.<br /><br />The characters were interesting. The plot was fast paced and engaging.<br /><br />Overall, its a must read for all ages.

0553385461|5.0|As the almost forgotten Mr. Rumsfeld observed, there are known unknowns and then there are unknown unknowns. Some of us are curious enough to at least wonder about the former.  Most of the rest of us lack the time or the dedication or, let's admit it, the intellectual capacity to take the hard journey to the frontiers between what we know or we believe we know today and what's on the other side - and the frontiers are moving farther and farther away from us. It takes a down-to-Earth genius like Stephen Hawking to give us a guided tour to the current limits of human knowledge and back and we can even get a hint of what may be lying across the border. It's a high altitude flight and very little experience is necessary for us to follow our guide but, when it's over, most of us are likely to agree that we gained a better understanding of the world in which we live than we had before we started reading. Unless we are string theorists ourselves, of course :)<br /><br />I found the book to be relatively easy to read, interesting and informative. Even the little digressions into Newton's 'real' character (not a very nice person) were welcome. It is, indeed, a history, in the sense that it maps the human understanding of reality as it grew and evolved in time.<br /><br />In the end... I still have no idea what TIME really is (does anyone?) but I enjoyed reading the book because, many time, I had the feeling that 'aha, I DO understand this now'.
B001CISHU4|4.0|Once again another great release from a great band. They don't stray far from their trademark sound here which is a good and bad thing. I mean its good but its basically the same thing as before. There are guest musicians that make an appearance on the album which changes things up a bit. But the album for me was just sort of a let down after With Oden on Our Side.

B00006J9OT|4.0|Sometimes live performances don't live up to to their studio counterparts, but in this case Krall adds dimension and depth to her already formidable studio recordings. Dexterously inventive, she puts improvisation back into jazz-isn't that is what jazz is all about? You'll recognize all the old standards, and some super arrangements. She knows how to swing and her up-tempo version of 'Devil May Care', to my ears, is slick and simply dazzling.<br /><br />(Warning: Jazz critics may turn their noses up at all this as they seem to do when a jazz artist achieves a modicum of popularity or crossover appeal(then they wonder why jazz is an endangered species) but just ignore them-Diana Krall is one of the best to come along in a long long time)

It also coincided with Greek Mythology a social studies subject in 6th grade. It was fabulous, and we have since read books 2 and 3.  He was THRILLED that a new installment was avaailable and even read it himself!  Can't wait for book 5, Riordan is a genius!

0385340567|1.0|I love Jack Reacher books, but this is definitely the worst Jack Reacher saga and possibly the worst book ever. Its cardboard characters CRAWLED to the finishing line. It's the first time that I've ever set the audible speed on my iPod to \\"Fast\\" (only because I'm one of those people who can't NOT finish a book, no matter how bad). And absolutely the most convoluted plot ever.<br /><br />Once authors develop a following, why do some of them feel the need to start using their books as soap boxes? Stop pounding us with a sledge hammer on your political views, Lee Child. Get off your soap box and go back to what you're great at doing: telling edge-of-your-seat stories through Jack \\"Dirty Harry\\" Reacher. PLEASE, turn off your inner Michael Moore. It just doesn't jive with Jack Reacher. [[ASIN:0385340567 Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher Novels)

B0017ZB8M6|1.0|Katy Perry is another wayward female jumping on the Sex and the City \\"I talk about how much sex I have and therefore I am empowered as a Woman despite the repeated making of ill-advised sexual decisions\\" bandwagon. The songs are boring, glossy, and far too over-produced to suit Katy's fake indie image. Shopping at Fred Flare does not an indie goddess make.
0385340990|5.0|I was only two when this book takes place.  However I grew up on old b&w English movies from the period, both before and after the war.<br /><br />I was barely pages into \\"Potato Peel\\", as I refer to it, when I was hooked.  In a period of two days I consumed the book, something I haven't done in ages - and we're talking about 30 years.<br /><br />It was difficult at first keeping everyone straight, but that is the case with a lot of novels with many characters.<br /><br />Shaffer's descriptions of the locales were so vivid that they played like a Travel Channel episode in my mind.<br /><br />As I titled this review, only PBS can do justice with this in a series, not a two hour movie.  Too much would be lost if it were shortend.

B000TGCR3I|4.0|I gotta say, for a single disc release, it's got loads of useful and interesting information for those interested in animation.<br /><br />The 300-day Diary with director Michael Arias was the most interesting of the features, in my opinion. His road to completing this film was such a bumpy one, that one can only appreciate it even more. His struggle with some of the animation sequences, and solutions... my only wish was to have dedicated a short period of time on how they went about the work with the voice actors, which I thought was great.<br /><br />There's also a small sneak peek at how Plaid worked on the music for the film.<br /><br />Also appreciated, the various tracks of subtitles and audio tracks!

B0018CMJSU|5.0|First off, I too have seen this set offered for far less. However, at any price, it's worth it. Even if you have the 2001 set, this new version has a much crisper picture and sound, making it a much better experience to watch and fully enjoy. The new extras are wonderful such as the great documentary on the problems making the film and how the film has impacted popular culture. The leftover extras from the first set are still great like the hour-long documentary on the making of the saga and the slew of deleted scenes that do add new layers (and for thos complaining about this not being the \\"Saga\\" set, some of those scenes are included in this category). So for any fan of either these films or just great movies in general, this set is a must-have in order to enjoy these classics to their fullest.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|I am always fascinated buying used CDs from Amazon.  The process is seemless and you really don't know that you are dealing with hundreds of other small vendors.  The product quality was excellent as described and I played the CD for days on end when it arrived.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|This is a brilliant story. It follows a police officer and shows another side of september 11. It is fiction, but at the same time is close to the truth. (I might be wrong about that actually, it might be a true story) Forgive me for not having the full facts on it before typing this review. It is well worth seeing all the same.
B00005V9IK|1.0|I don't know how to explain to somebody that likes this why this movie sucks. Here's a few random things that come to mind in no particular order: 1) Will Smith is an uninteresting actor except for when he was in MEN IN BLACK and some other movie I can't remember the title of. 2) Bill Pullman is the president. 3) The president is one of the heros of the movie. LAME. Presidents are cowards and frauds that would hide in a bunker somewhere. 4) The plot is dumb and sucks; particularly the silly backstory between the president and Jeff Goldblum. 5) The name of the movie is lame. INDEPENDENCE DAY. Right. First we kicked British --- and now the aliens. America Rules!!! USA! USA! USA! America is saves the planet. The way the aliens are defeated- Lol! OK, \\"it's just a movie\\". It was a virus that destroyed them like in some other story about an alien invasion, but this time one for the alien's computers. \\"Star Wars\\" for the next generation I spot a reviewer claim?! SAY WHAT?? Sorry, that reviewer doesn't got a clue. And comparing it to STARSHIP TROOPERS? No, that is completely wrong. Saying this movie is better than STARSHIP TROOPERS is a complete misunderstanding of what STARSHIP TROOPERS was about. They didn't get it. STARSHIP TROOPERS is both a brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick in certain aspects masquerading as a B movie as well as perfect parody of WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive \\"bugs\\" to make the point. Stuff that works: I like seeing the White House explode and other stuff. The alien ships look pretty cool.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Prior to Lonesome Dove, Gone With The Wind was my favorite movie.  But my favorite now is Lonesome Dove.  It is well written, produced, directed, edited, and the music is so fantastic!  L.D. probably has more memorable one-liners than any movie ever made.  And I am glad it was made as a mini-series rather than a movie, because we get six hours of enjoyment, which is three or four times more than if it were released in theaters.  I cannot heap too much praise on this classic . . .
B000OVLBHG|5.0|STARSHIP TROOPERS is both brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick. The concept behind it and what you get on the screen is a perfect parody of infamous WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized, jingoistic humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive \\"bugs\\" to make the point. In the top 20 best sci-fi films ever and a lot of fun.
B000KJU182|5.0|This is Terence Stamp's best performance, and one of his earliest.  This is one of those rare movies that stands the test of time.  It is well written, directed, acted, etc.      Billy Budd, along with Mutiny On The Bounty, are the two most authentic movies ever produced that takes place primarily on a ship.  If you have not seen this movie, you will be amazed at the quality of this production.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|This boxset was absolutely amazing.  I was thrilled with the item the second I opened it.  I couldn't believe the amount of thought that was put into creating this DVD collection together.  This is truly a collection that a diehard Beatles fan should not be without.
0439023483|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim and was not disappointed. The evening I began reading, I could not put it down.

B000784WMW|3.0|Right off, I have to admit that this version is very faithful to the orinal novel. I cannot find any fault with it in that way. If you want something that feels like the novel done word-for-word, this is the one. In that aspect, I really enjoyed it. There were, however, some stylistic flaws that got in my way.    First thing is the cinematography. It was terrible. I understand that this was made for TV in 1983, but that understanding only makes it seem a little bit better. It is kind of like watching a home video. I suppose that I have gotten used to even TV movies trying to reach the level of cinematic excellence in filming that films have now. It threw me off a little bit because the filming looked a lot like that done for soap operas. I am not a fan of soap operas, and at times it was hard to get away from that feeling.    The sound quality of the production was ok, but it kind of felt like a filmed version of a stage play. If they moved too far away from the camera, they sounded far away and kind of like they were fighting to be heard.    While I liked overall Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rochester, he seemed, at times, too happy to be Rochester. I have never seen a Rochester smile so much. Yes, he is supposed to be charming, but there is a stretch in the middle when he completely loses the brooding quality that I have come to associate with that character. And, by the way, he is far too pretty to be Rochester. I almost laughed when Jane said that he was not handsome. Come on, he was James Bond. He's gorgeous.    One last comment about the DVD. Why couldn't they have taken out the credits for each episode. I watched the whole thing straight through, and I was a little annoyed at having to fast forward through 11 sets of beginning titles and 10 sets of end credits. It interrupted the story.    Overall, this was a very faithful adaptation, but the poor production quality, though understandable because of when it was made, limited my enjoyment of it.
B001CLG6RC|3.0|I'm writing as a longtime Enigma fan, from day one of this project, I've loved Cretu's music.  My favorite album was Le Roi Est Morte, Vive Le Roi.  If you're expecting a comeback to the level of genius that that album was, quit now while you're ahead.  In A Posteriori, we saw a return of the style that Cretu was best at (not that Voyageur was a bad album, it was different and good but not what fans are used to).  In Seven Lives, Many Faces, Cretu goes back to some unfamiliar territory.  That is, pop music, influenced by other people rather than simply defining it himself.  The album lacks the ongoing musical thematic elements Enigma's known for.  Cretu didn't make songs, he made albums, but not true this time around.<br /><br />That's a good synopsis of the first half.  Pop music that's already been done.  Very dated.  That said, as you venture to the second half of the album, it gets stronger and stronger, especially in the instrumentals, and are definitely good ones to make love to (the real measure of an Enigma song).  Possibly some of his better work.  The later songs with singing are reminiscent of the Cross of Changes album.  Pop ethnic ambient, one song is a Spanish Return to Innocence, another sounds like a French Dream of the Dolphin.  When Cretu sings though, he just brings an eighties pop samurai sound to it.  I liked his voice on Voyageur, not so much here.  He lets down his hair in this one.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is the best series I have seen in my life. I am crazy about this show.
0439023483|5.0|I wasn't so sure I would like this.  Not really into Sci-FI.  Once you get past the first couple of chapters, you are hooked.  Very clever and creatively written.  Good story for a young adult - not too young tough, as some of the storylines are tough to take in.  Definitely recommend!
0143113100|5.0|This book looks like a solid sort of semi academic-y pot-boiler but in fact it is a hugely engaging, eye-popping even,take on how wrong the long held belief of 'localizationism' was (the view that the brain is made up mostly of hard-wired areas fit for only one purpose) for example, claims like, the auditory cortex is only for hearing, the visual cortex is only for seeing and such like.  it turns out that the brain is highly plastic (able to rewire itself over time) given the appropriate stimulus, and when disasters occur in the body or the brain, other parts can be recruited in to do the processing work.     It's a basic truism that we learn far more from failure than success.   Health disasters that befall people can turn out to be very instructive and beneficial for future sufferers.  Even those with very rare conditons can benefit when a seemingly intractable case is handled by an inspired doctor/scientist improvising with unorthodox methods. There is much hope to draw from all this, especially when success is achieved with conditions that the mainstream considers to be irreversible.     Brain plasticity is the coherent theme of the whole book and it is always the focus of every chapter in ever more novel and surprising ways.    I cannot begin to do justice to how Doidge explains this, because he is quite simply brilliant at writing.    Each chapter concentrates on a particular narrative or story of how plastic the brain is, the chapters are like high quality Vanity Fair articles and would even stand on their own, expect that there is a sense of progression in the book and later chapters recapitulate findings from earlier ones.    I have a sense that Doidge (who is a psychiatrist I believe) would have spent an enormous amount of time refining this book as it is beautifully crafted, hearteningly articulate and deserves to win a prestigious prize.    my favourites saying from the book is about how plasticity comes about:  \\"neurons that fire together wire together\\"Read it, you're in for a massive treat.

B0019T9FL6|4.0|This is an amazing work of emotion.  I reached the 4th track \\"Giving Myself\\" and it was if I was expressing feelings inside that needed to be set free and let out. Jennifer makes this album work because she feels her music and she sings with pssion. Maybe the producers needed to market this work of art their way but she stills delivers and the cd trys to reach all taste of soul. Some might say that repeating songs is a bit too much but for a song that helped her reach the soul of so many, we can't hate just congratulate her for sharing her gifted talent with us.

Other producers should take what Gail Hurd & James Cameron did on this DVD as a template on how to do it right.

It was not received well at the theaters because it was for such a nitch market but the film itself was excellent, with a wonderfully paced story, great and furious action, and evenly paced character development. This film had all the elements. Keeping well in step with the series, Serenity just showed us why Firefly needed to be picked up by another network. Unfortunately it wasn't but this film was a great send off - Thanks Joss

B0019T9FL6|5.0|I'm really enjoying Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson's debut CD. Jennifer has one the the biggest and most soulful voices around. From the midtempo, let me spread my wings and fly Ne-Yo penned first single, \\"Spotlight,\\" to the rock tinged R&B of \\"If This Isn't Love,\\" to the Hip-Hop, beat boxing, Doo Wop of \\"Pocketbook,\\" featuring a colorful verse from one of the best emcees alive, Ludacris, to the aching Robin Thicke penned and produced R&B ballad, \\"Giving Myself,\\" Miss Hudson and her team of writers and producers deliver with a diverse set of songs. One of the CDs highlights is a duet with J-Hud's former American Idol Season 3 competitor, Fantasia. Both of these ladies have two of the strongest sets of pipes in the music game, and they don't disappoint with the soul ballad, \\"I'm His Only Woman.\\" The song, written by Missy Elliott and new R&B upstart Jazmine Sullivan, begins with Fantasia phoning Jennifer to introduce herself as \\"Tony's girlfriend.\\" Problem is, Jennifer is \\"Tony's woman.\\" Needless to say, this starts one of the most soulful catfights on wax in recent memory. The music is a throwback to some old '70s Stax records productions and the lyrics are biting, like a young Patti and Aretha goin' at it. Another highlight is the big R&B ballad, \\"We Gon' Fight,\\" written by Tank, where J-Hud stands proudly with her Man to fend off all whom they see as potential threats to their relationship. The CD even ends with a Gospel number, \\"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There,\\" where J-Hud shows off the gritty church voice of her's.     This CD was well worth the wait. I enjoyed all but one song, the T-Pain produced and featured \\"What's Wrong (Go Away).\\" The problem has nothing to do with Jennifer, who is just as captivating as ever, but all to do with T-Pain. This is a song that required a strong Male R&B voice, like Mario, John Legend, R. Kelly, Usher or Ruben Studdard. What is has is T-Pain \\"singing\\" in Auto-Tune. This effect ruins a perfectly good song. T-Pain should takeinto consideration that Auto-Tune doesn't work on everything.     I hope this CD is just as golden for her as the Oscar's were last year.

B0004Z33EG|5.0|Rambo is a classic action flick, flawlessly simple yet swarming with underlying themes that push it to the edge. The story of a wandering Vietnam vet who walks into a small, quiet town in Washington in search of his last remaining friend never reaches a happy ending. Upon discovering that his last buddy has died of cancer, John Rambo heads into town trying to find a place to eat and collect his thoughts but instead he gets picked up by the sheriff and thrown into jail for vagrancy. When Rambo starts seeing flashbacks from his days as a prisoner of war  that mimic  the abuse caused by deputy Teasle and his buddies all hell breaks loose as he fights his way out of the prison, grabbing his 14 split sawteeth blade, the only trusty friend in his world and dashes out in the wilderness.     From his dog tags the sheriff knows that Rambo is a war hero and a green beret, but still is unable to leave him alone. He drives after him and begins a hunt, one that will change his life in allsorts of ways. Attacked for no reason, Rambo tries to talk his way out but when they draw first blood he fights back the only way he knows how, and that only means one thing - lots of surprise attacks and lots of bodies that starts to vanish, as if sucked into the mountainous terrain by a mysterious force. The more Teasle pushes to find Rambo the worse their personal war gets and in the end the town in hanging by its last legs as John unleashes all the demons in his head unto the smug sheriff and his unfriendly town.    This is such a great movie, I finally got to see it again after many years and it's still amazing. I was in the mood to make it a Rambo day yesterday and see the other three parts but life got in the way. But man, this is so enjoyable and satisfying, it reminds me of the sweet days I spend with my dad watching these movies as a kid and while he lives far away they make me feel close to him. The misty, smoky mountains turned into a trap that Rambo maneuvered skillfully with bare hands except for his trusty knife. I still have a memory of my father making a replica of the Rambo knife, without the compass, so seeing it in the movie made me chuckle, the shape burned into my memory. For those who have never seen it give it a try, it's good even all those years later and has truly stood the test of time.    - Kasia S.
B000W91RUG|2.0|This is not a review of the show, which I love. But it's very disappointing to watch the show in HDTV, and then find out that the DVD is only being offered in standard definition.

Please, Warner, bring out your high-def television shows on high-def DVD.

B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead-Inferno ****1/2<br /><br />Brutal isn't the right word, just the first to come to mind. Inferno was Motorhead's 2004 album and one of their heaviest and all time best. Easily the strongest since 1995.<br /><br />Mikkey Dee proves once again that he is currently the best drummer in all of rock n' roll. His power, speed, sometimes refrain, fills, and all around accuracy make him the man for the sticks! Philip Campbell is no slouch on Inferno either. Some of the best guitar playing of his career can be found here. His dueling lead work with the great Steve Vai on 'Terminal Show' and 'Down On Me' is stunning. But what is most amazing is his acoustic playing on 'Whorehouse Blues.' Then there is Mr. Kilmister. Some of his most vivid and image ridden lyrics ever. Not to mention his vocals are the best they have been since [[ASIN:B00005NQIH Another Perfect Day]]. Then his flawless bass playing which needs no introduction.<br /><br />'Terminal Show' is one of the most intricate tracks the band has ever released as well as one of their best. 'Killers' is among their most intense. The angry protest of 'In The Name Of Tragedy' is classic Motorhead in the vein of the Iron Fist album of the early 1980's. 'In The Year Of The Wolf' might be the groups greatest song. 'Smiling Like A Killer' is Motorhead at their most evil, and intelligent at the same time.<br /><br />'Whorehouse' shines above all though. It is the song we all knew Lemmy had in him since the beginning and when he finally wrote it he nailed it. Perfect line up for it as well. Top five Motorhead songs easily.<br /><br />Inferno is really nothing new for Motorhead (with the exception of 'Whorehouse Blues') it is the same old formula just faster and louder. But they nail it (again). If your a fan and looking for yet another solid and great Motorhead album this will make a fine addition. No it isn't an instant classic, and yes they have made better albums; but Inferno won't do any harm to your record collection...except maybe melt all your other albums.ms.

B0017VG69U|5.0|I watched scratchy Star Trek reruns on UHF when I  was younger.  The difference is...well, light-years!  These discs seem to beyond even the usual cleanup  effects.  There is detail, but the color is spot-on  true to the cheesy props, and some of the added  footage, like in \\"Amok Time\\", is super.  You can  see the pulp sci-fi art-work, the wardrobe details  in \\"A piece of the Action\\", the funky face pigments  on the 'aliens'.  Sound is super.  My daughter is  enjoying the cool packaging,too.    It costs, but it's great.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|A friend and I viewed the MamaMia movie and sat enthralled by Abba's music and the fast pace of the cast. It was great to have a good musical grace the wide screen once again.  Merryl Streep was wonderful as always and I do think someone could have sung better than Pierce Brosnan but he held his part well.  The young girl who was to be married was so cute and sang beautifully. The rest of the cast carried the theme exceptionally. I play the cd over and over just to hear that music by Abba.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|At first it looks and sounds light and even amateurish, and then you understand it is fully positioned on another level. It is a mixture of several genres within the frame of a science-fiction film entirely contained in , and around, a special spaceship called Serenity, a spaceship that is a firefly, a bug, a burning insect. The first genre is the functional and psychological happenings within a team of nine people who are together for both the best and the worst, in order to transform the worst into the best, or at least the better by being together. The team is limited to nine people, a perfect diabolic and satanic number, and no manipulation like Serenity is the tenth character will take that dimension away. Nine is perfect because you always have at least one who is totally set apart from the regrouping of people into couples or pairs. And in the end you wonder who is the one who is really apart, who is totally odd, alone because of the various and subtle compositions with only one couple that is really defined as such and all the others being transient, multiple, varied, changing, shifting at various levels of possible realization. In a way it is Star Trek revisited but without all the hullaballoo that goes along with the soldiers, the mechanics, the petty personnel of a flagship. The second genre is of course, recurrent and varied too, the western but in many realizations too. Of course we have the very traditional space western or space cowboy film, like in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, seen from the point of view of the driver marooned on the side of the road after having been forced to lend his car. But there is more. We can think of other models: Dead or Alive, Bonanza (even), Mad Max, a vague allusion to Star wars with the Alliance, a lot of Jules Verne, William Gibson and a few others, even at times, though they might not  know it, Ron Hubbard, and the bordello in the desert is so close to some Indian bordello in some Bollywood classic. We do not have John Wayne and the Indians, but we can afford not to have that genocidal side of the western. The next genre is more trendy and modern with some kind of loose and yet very emotional sensual, erotic even, life or imagination. Many allusions, visual or linguistic, and even here and there an allusion to gay people, slack, as they come up like in one episode, though this side of personal life is warded off nicely, and the allusion to crazy, insane and yet envisaged incest was purely rejected from the series and is a supplementary scene, meaning, a censored one, even if self-censored. We could go on for ever with that game. But what is important is that the film or the series is highly original in the end. It is deeply human and humane, deeply attached to justice and fairness, even with someone who trips into treachery for a slight moment, or one episode. At the same time it is ruthless and even maybe cruel by indifference like when bringing the millionaire to the easy lady he had made pregnant and whose child he had tried to steal knowing that he was going to be shot blank on the spot  by the mother, or also when they get rid of the bounty-hunter by just pushing him into space where he is going to die slowly, except of course if he shortens his life himself and commits suicide. The series is also highly imaginative and each episode really has a knack and appeal of its or their own. We enter the episode and we will be released only when the  case is concluded. Each episode is perfectly self-contained, even when what is announced in one episode does not take place in the next one because the announcement is the punch line of the concerned episode and it would unbalance the next episodes if it were made true. So they whirl around with a pirouette, when they bother, or they just forget, or they think of it and discard it to the supplementary scenes. Self-containment is the best quality of each of these episodes. In other words quite a successful series that, it is true, found its magic achievement in that final symbolic metaphoric blending of Serenity and River, of the escaping spaceship and the mentally disarrayed girl. Then the team is one and the odd shot of that team becomes the heart and soul of it in this final blending. The route has been run from the beginning to the end and the final harbor has been reached beyond all the deserts and dangers possible. They can  live happily ever after. There is a certain fairy tale dimension in this series, and it is one of its stronger assets.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinese, found its magic achievement in that final symbolic metaphoric blending of Serenity and River, of the escaping spaceship and the mentally disarrayed girl.

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Consider this a must buy for Tull fans.  'Bursting Out' is a brilliant collection of the best of the European 1978 tour featuring the lineup that would leave a lasting impression, John Glascock, Barriemore Barlow, Martin Barre, John Evan, David Palmer, and of course our good friend Ian Anderson.  From the enthusiastic introduction by Claude Nobs, to the Aqualung reprise at the end of 'The Dambusters March' the listener is treated to the very best of live Tull, there really isn't a weak moment on this album, it's all good.  I've been adding albums to my Tull collection, and really added this one without alot of thought, but after buying it I'm excited to have it, and can strongly recommend it to all Tull fans.  5 stars.
B001CISHU4|4.0|I've been getting into this band more and more in the last few years...\\"With Oden..\\" really caught my attention and this album expands on their broader brutal sound. Don't make the mistake of thinking anything is compromised, though, the band attacks and destroys like an unstoppable Viking horde on the warpath. This could  be the soundtrack to a Viking war movie. If you are looking to get into this band, this could be a nice introduction for you as I plan to review their back catalog more than ever after hearing this. Top notch vocals and instrumentation. Brooding technical assault and absolutely the BEST ALBUM COVER ARTWORK of 2008 so far...
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie was in GREAT CONDITION and the shipping was very fast!!! Wonderful service and a wonderful movie to add to my collection (since I have the first one...lol).
159562015X|5.0|We loved the concept behind this book (and its Christian companion, \\"Living Your Strengths\\"). Our church staff took the (included with book) online StengthsFinder assessment and all found it very accurate and helpful in providing insights on what drives our fellow co-workers. It brings to light strengths you may not have identified previously and validates them - empowering you to explore and utilize them in new ways. We just ordered enough for our ministry leaders and church council and will be recommending it to our congregation as a very helpful tool not only for self-discovery, but also insight on others who have taken the StrengthsFinder assessment.
1847370292|1.0|... is NOT positive thinking, the 'law of attraction,' or any other such nonsense.<br /><br />When the U.S. economy collapsed in the fall of 2008, one cannot help but notice that \\"positive thinking\\" was never, ever, ever proposed as a solution to the economic problems by anyone in any serious position of authority.<br /><br />Not a single person on either side of the aisle in congress; nor by anyone on Wall Street.<br /><br />Why? Because 'positive thinking' is simplistic and doesn't work.<br /><br />Skip this book.
0316113506|3.0|The content is interest and important, but he simply repeats himself too much. This is a 250 page book with 75 pages of substance.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Well done remastering.  Colors are nice and vivid.  Everything we remember from the theatres back when it was orginally released.  Worth buying!
B001E75QGG|5.0|This is how it's supposed to be when you go to the theatre!  Best movie of the decade, best UFO movie of all time,   and the ULTIMATE Indy movie.  This is what Indiana Jones is all about.  I've heard people say it's corny. (as they put on their purple gym pants with those 80's triangles on them).  No really, it rocks. If you think it's corny, you take things a wee bit 2 seriously.   In my opinion.
B001E75QGG|1.0|No wonder Brandon Frasier passed on this one.    Raiders is one of my favorite movies. The second one is okay, the third I enjoyed quite a bit.    But I don't remember any silly little CGI creatures in the originals. There was Indy's old flame, Marion - in Skull her character is abandoned - all you get is Karen Alen with a dumb smile on her face. When a jeep lands on a tree and springs off it into a river - she has a ridiculous smile the whole time. The original Indy flicks were fun but almost scary at times. This one is just plain silly. CGI ants, monkeys (the monkey scene is probably one of the lowest points in the flick), prairie dogs, etc. And yes, they're silly, too!    The dialog is so stiff at times, scenarios are so forced, all I could do was wait for the movie to end. And it took a long time for that wonderful moment to come.    There's not really much of a plot. There is a skull, they must get it and place it somewhere. That's it. And oh my, the last 20 minutes must have $30 million in CGI but not much really happens.     If you loved the over the top CGI from the first 3 Indy movies and the complete lack of an interesting story, then you'll LOVE this one.    I would rank this down as one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Probably about halfway in I lost interest and spent more time examining my fingernails, noticing all the little details at my theater I'd never paid attention to. I didn't have a phone or Gameboy so there wasn't a lot to do.    I've spent more time discussing Crystal Skull than I had to. May the minutes wasted on Crystal Skull be a warning to those fortunate enough not to have scene the Mummy 4.    I'd really like it if George Lucas stopped producing films.

0143038419|5.0|The book is excellent, and a good read that's hard to put down. Elizabeth Gilbert did and excellent job in sharing her journey to get closer with God, in this book. This book has change my views on the day to day stressors and how I handled them. My development with God has truly been changed in reading this book, I have found God to be so wonderful and exciting and my life has truly changed for the better.
0743289692|3.0|This was a very interesting read and I was intrigued by the author's life from childhood until her escape to the Nethelands and subsequent involvement in politics there. However, I question Ali's complete disavowel of Islam and wonder if she, instead, should be condemning the oppressive cultural behaviors of Muslim extremists instead of the religion as a whole. For this reason, I would have liked a more in depth analysis of the positions that, ultimately, led to her leaving the Parliment and the Netherlands.
B0002Z1EG2|2.0|This is the first Shania Twain CD that I have purchased, but I was very disappointed with the musical content.  Probably will not buy any other Shania Twain CD's.
0321344758|5.0|Great book that appears simple but really is a great foundation of web principles that you can always go back and refer to. It's a pretty quick read and is actually fun to go through if you're in this line of work.
0375826726|1.0|Christopher Paolini has gone the way of other writers like Jane Auel and Clan of the Cave Bear.  He took an initially good story and strayed so far off course that none but the most dedicated Eragon fans could endure the drivel.  When I saw the back jacket and realized that this story was going to drag on I didn't even bother finishing the book.
B0016CS0IK|5.0|Just incredible!! This album stages a growth of character for M83. The songs are well written, the vocals are brilliant, the general feel of the album is of major introspect. I really love the way this album makes me feel.If you love ethereal moods and really well thought out songwriting, this album is for you!
B000UJ48UO|3.0|Full metal Jacket is really two movies in one. The first movie is a very realistic journey through the boot camp process for the marines. The reason why its so realistic is that Kubrick found a DI who could act and let the process run as if it were real. The only flaw in it is the murder-suicide at the end. Its just not realistic. It would have been more belevable as an ordinary suicide. The other thing that didn't quite catch is that DIs and the process don't just punish the weak. They go after the strong ones too.    The second half of the movie is worthless. The main character is suddenly made a journalist in Vietnam for a handful of pointless scences hanging around base and then just as suddenly is pushed into fighting in an infantry squad in Hue. All the realism of the early part of the film is lost. Suddenly we have Rambo running around with the big gun that never needs ammunition. We have marines advancing into a city of Hue that looks like Stalingrad. While Hue might have looked like this after the marines cleared the city, its kind of a major mistake to make it look like this BEFORE they cleared it. Everything about the \\"combat\\" scenes is wrong.     And what does everything build to. Pity for a female Vietnamese sniper. The leads spend more time whining, crying and acting like idiots over the sniper than they did over their own dead.     The only positive thing I can say about the second half the film is that its missing all the unrealistic \\"soldiers talk about the war\\" scenes that fill most every other movie about vietnam.     Watch the film for the first half and shut it off when they get to Vietnam.     As far as blu-ray goes, this film doesn't deserve it and doesn't benefit from it. It might as well have been on DVD.
0596522347|5.0|I teach people how to win in high stakes presentation situations. I have always advocated the power of verbal visuals (metaphors and analogies) to drive home a point particularly \\"when your audience just doesn't get it.\\"  I love Slide:ology because it is a brilliant book for anyone who needs to make a point with actual visuals.  Rich in examples and case studies, its messaging and lay-out model what it is selling with grace, elegance and sophistication. A must-have for all communicators.
B00190OHD6|5.0|After being in her shoes I think this movie is beautiful.  Hilary did a great job of portraying the emotions that one goes through and did so beautifully. Life goes on around you, but you have to make the choice to step out onto the sidewalk.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. I have seen Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Dusk til Dawn, Jackie Brown and a few others. Loved them all. But, this film was FREAKING SLOW!! OMG, I was falling asleep in the first 30 minutes. And by the final car chase scene (WHICH WAS AWESOME). I was desperately wanting the get the hell out of the theater. WAY too much talking and not nearly enough action.
B0015FML06|5.0|We've waited years for it and here it is.  Finally.  I have every U2 concert DVD you can have (even the Super Bowl performance and SNL) yet this is the one DVD that was a no-brainer.    For those of you around back then, it's nostalgic.  This concert is what turned me on to U2.  For some reason, MTV was showing it in 83 and when I saw it I said \\"Who ARE these guys?\\"  From that point on, I was hooked.  All because of this.    For others of you not old enough, this is a chance to see U2 at their absolute peak when they were the Band That Mattered, before they started playing around with irony beginning with Achtung Baby.  Not that they don't matter now, but as other reviewers have pointed out, this is THE definitive version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" just as Live Aid was the definitive version of \\"Bad.\\"    The songs are almost universally great and well-played (save for a sloppy trainwreck of \\"Two Hearts\\") and you get to see the original order of the set; if you owned this back in the day, it made it seem like \\"Surrender\\" was the opening song.    The visuals are stunning because of the weather.  The crowd is nuts.  And this was the concert that launched U2 into the big time.    AS FOR PICTURE QUALITY: as the director clearly states in the commentary, this was shot on VIDEO.  It's been treated to look like film for this reissue, but it was video.  And when you point a video camera at a light, it \\"burns\\" the tube, creating streaks across the screen which are all over this.  That was the POINT.  The director threw out all the \\"rules\\" for filming and did not care about the streaking/flaring.  This is NOT a flaw in the remaster it ALWAYS looked like this.  If you want a perfect picture go buy Live in Boston or Rattle & Hum.      Who cares about the red streaks when you have a concert this powerful?  Finally it is here and it was worth the wait.  Enjoy!    The attached CD is a fine version of the EP but really I'd rather watch this than listen to it.  Plus, not all the songs on the EP were pulled from the Red Rocks show (only \\"Party Girl\\" and \\"Gloria\\").  Still worth having.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|What the movie is about, from what I gathered, is a team (World Police) that wants to kill off the terrorists. They want to recruit someone, and well, basically if you think of the typical format, you have the movie. guy comes in, doesn't want to join, later decides to, runs off, other guys in trouble, he comes back, has to save the day, and does.  I am Conversation, and this is mostly bashing left wing liberals, but that didn't make a difference. This movie was horrible. If I was home, I would have turned this off within the first 15 minutes of it, but I was at my sisters house and I didn't have my car with me (under repairs), so there I sat, a whole 98 minutes of garbage.  Watch American Carol with Kevin Farley. It's a ton better! That was a funny film. But this, way too vulgar, too stupid, no real creative, a very mature nude/love making scene. Too potty mouth!  avoid!
B001E95ZNI|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />In \\"Appaloosa,\\" which is set in the New Mexican territory of 1882, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are a pair of frontier lawmen hired by the citizens of Appaloosa to wrest control of the town from a gang of ruffians (led by Jeremy Irons) after they shoot down the marshal and his deputies in cold blood.  Renee Zellweger also shows up as a promiscuous widow who captures the eye and eventually the heart of the newly appointed sheriff (Harris).<br /><br />Co-written by Harris and Robert Knott (from a novel by Robert B. Parker) and directed (rather ploddingly) by Harris, \\"Appaloosa\\" pays homage to the time-honored traditions of the Western genre, as the forces of Good, represented by Harris and Mortensen, square off against the forces of Evil, embodied by Irons and his cohorts.<br /><br />There's not much that is truly new here, except perhaps for a refreshingly novel moral slackness in the lead female character.  Yet, while the characterizations are rich, the relationships complex and the performances authentic, the movie itself suffers from a bad case of inertia, loping along at an enervating pace when it should be racing ahead at a full-on gallop.<br /><br />There's substance of a sort to \\"Appaloosa;\\" it's just a question of whether you'll be able to stay awake long enough to fully absorb and appreciate it.
B00004SVID|5.0|This is as far as I know the last live recording that the original members of Pink Floyd did. It is an awesome concert of their smash album \\"The Wall\\". Excellent recording Love it!!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|If you're a child/teen of the 80's you'll want to get this!  Every time a song came on I couldn't believe it was another great song of theirs that I had forgotten about.  What an awesome CD!  I highly recommend it!
B001CIPU3G|4.0|This was always going to be a tough task for Trivium. How to match the earlier success, but still not sound like a complete sellout. I think this album succeeds admirably well. First let me say that this is NOT an overtly commercial record. Sure there are melodies both sung and played, but this doesn't mean it is cheesy or weak. Trivium have been combining rough and clean vocals for a while, and this album shows that potential being achieved. Same with heavy riffing interposed with beautiful melodies. The clean voices and choruses sound much less like Hetfield. The growling is deeper and more \\"death\\" style. I have always enjoyed their guitars, and again, you won't be disappointed. Tons of riffs and solos. Also, there is a bit more depth to the songs, both in scope and in musicality. Get this album if you like newer metal with a major classic metal influence, lots of solos, and thundering riffs and powerful drumming / bass. It will not disappoint. There is nothing really bad about it. Good for them!!
B00007GZR5|5.0|I owned this movie before.  then someone stole it!  since its my favorite movie of all time, i had to get it again.  yes, it is a romance, some say chick flick, but its a good one!
0440243661|4.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />Not as good as \\"One Shot\\" by a long shot and some previous Jack Reacher novels as well, \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" is nevertheless a worthy thriller by Lee Child.  I wouldn't classify it as one of his best efforts because I prefer Jack Reacher the Loner to Jack Reacher the Groupie.  What makes Reacher click with the reader is his effectiveness as a loner.  As a member of a team in \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" he loses this effectiveness and much of his luster as a unique character.<br /><br />In this novel, Reacher rounds up his old buddies from his military days, which slows down the action to all but a dead stall, and sets out to investigate the disappearance of another of their military comrades.  In the process, they discover an international conspiracy.  Prior to that, Reacher and his pals roam around Vegas in this outing and have to whack out a baddie who is bird-dogging them and bury him in true Vegas fashion  under cement, what else, Mafia-style.  After all, what would you expect in a city created by Bugsy Siegel?<br /><br />When all is said and done, this is still a fine thriller and well worth the read.  If you haven't read a Reacher novel before, however, I would suggest you start with another book in the series, such as, \\"One Shot,\\" which centers around Reacher the Loner.<br />--Bryan Cassiday
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Ok folks this type of story is suppose to be a tad creepy. It's the Brothers Grimm for petes sake. And no it's not the most fantastic acting or story telling but it certainly does it's job well enough. And in the end....well doesn't everyone always live happily ever after...or do they? My husband and I enjoyed it. And not a fairy tale sugar plum story I think the effects and story twists are just about right for what it was...a story....about the Brothers Grimm....all made up of course....with a touch of yester year days of ole. Loosen up and enjoy with bowl of popcorn ...... have a creepy time of it this Halloween.
B000001E7T|5.0|Recorded during September and October of 1994 at Townhouse Three in Battersea, Polly Jean Harvey's second masterpiece \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is an everlasting piece of art. The record has garnered Polly a large cult following, a spot on end of the year lists, global recognition and it went platinum in 1995. It's no surprise--the material found on \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is brimming with potency and strength. Guitars, organ, vibes and E-Bow fuel the fire in \\"To Bring You My Love\\", the opener of all openers. It continues with the brilliant beat set by Jean-Marc Butty in the stomping \\"Meet Ze Monsta\\". Polly's demanding performance makes you understand that she means business--big time. \\"To Bring You My Love\\" marks the most confident vocal delivery of PJ's career.<br /><br />The minimalism of her work is near perfect: \\"Working For The Man\\" bears but a small melody on a watery guitar and she barely sings the words; \\"I Think I'm A Mother\\" is a bluesy number that works as a homage to one of Polly's greatest heroes, Don Van Vliet (another direct homage on the album is \\"Teclo\\" which has a chorus melody taken straight from \\"Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles\\"). And although \\"Working For The Man\\" and \\"I Think I'm A Mother\\" leave something to be desired, the coherence of the record is one of its strongest points. The rest of the material on \\"To Bring You My Love\\" doesn't fail to astonish. Each song on the record--the excellent singles \\"C'Mon Billy\\" and \\"Down By The Water\\", the hard-rocker \\"Long Snake Moan\\", the guitar and strings driven \\"Send His Love To Me\\" and the elegant closer \\"The Dancer\\"--is filled with longing, lust and loneliness as the lyrics suggest. Polly plays many an instrument (chimes, organ, piano, bell, vibes, guitar) and she's a marvelous musician.<br /><br />\\"Down By The Water\\", a pure '90s classic, sounds like a frizzy drink with its excellent guitar melody led by Joe Gore and a murderous whispering coda at the end. The material on \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is simple, but original and unique, the singing is powerful, the lyrics close to being best of her career. String arrangement by Pete Thomas adds a delicate touch to the album, as does percussion by John Parish, the second genius behind this work. The songwriting touches upon religious themes and remains inspiring. Polly tried on the mask of desperation for the second time and played it so well that she can deservedly be called an actress, among other things. The most surprising thing about \\"To Bring You My Love\\" is how nothing on it sounds dated, mostly due to the album not being contextualized in terms of time and space, music-wise.<br /><br />It took her some time to recover from the overwhelming acclaim she received; it wasn't until 1998 that she released another album. Other than that, she stated in an interview that she was having the time of her life. \\"To Bring You My Love\\" seems cold and unwelcoming at first, but it demands active participation, as most of Polly's work. It is highly rewarding after more listens, and it showcases Polly as an album artist in the most strictest sense. She never repeated this move and it's no wonder--an artistic statement like this one happens only once in a lifetime.l and unique, the singing is powerful, the lyrics close to being best of her career.

B001EN71DG|5.0|Yeah yeah, so Skywalker Ranch is quadruple-dipping us. I don't care.<br /><br />Three movies. Six discs. When boxsets reach the two-discs-per-movie state, that's critical mass. That's when you should buy (see also: Batman Legacy vs. Anthology, Alien Legacy vs. Quadrilogy, god only knows how many Star Trek boxes have been released...). This is the Star<br />Wars Trilogy boxset to buy (no comments on the hexalogy box that we all know is coming...)<br /><br />It also looks great next to the new prequel trilogy box.<br /><br />As for the movies themselves, I was never terribly impressed with A New Hope, and I don't understand why fans worship the Empire Strikes Back (it's a good movie, but not THAT good), but Return of the Jedi is pretty solid, and come on... what DVD library is complete without Star Wars?<br /><br />One word: buy.
B00006AVRK|4.0|Those who have come to Hugh Laurie only through his curmudgeonly incarnation as House need to see his goofier side as Bertie Wooster, the upper class British bumbler who gets into dire strait after dire strait if not for the machinations of his valet, Jeeves. Stephen Fry is hilarious as the understated and intelligent Jeeves and Laurie is brilliant as the self-assured but obtuse and feckless bumbler. Those who love British humor and British TV and film, particularly period film, will find these very entertaining, I think.
B001E75QH0|3.0|Cheesy fun. That's all it is. If you're expecting realism or drama or the Godfather, you're barking up the wrong tree. If you're looking for 8 hours of cheesy fun, best accompanied by a bottle of vodka, then look no further.<br /><br />And if you're wondering about the fourth movie, don't worry. The ending very clearly emphasizes that Shia is NOT replacing Harrison, and there will only be one Indy :)<br /><br />The only big reason that I can see against buying this boxset is as follows: will this be the last one? I doubt it. Personally, I'm waiting for the fifteen-disc, six-movie box to be released... and you know it'll happen :)
B001E95ZNI|3.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" is an awkward, lumbering western, telling a half-hearted story about painfully underdeveloped characters. Having not read Robert B. Parker's original novel, I can't say how faithful this adaptation is. For Parker's sake, let's hope the film is a drastic departure. The dialogue is clunky, it's often unbearably slow, and for a plot that was meant to be a character study, it's remarkably vague. Ed Harris functions as the star, the co-writer, and the director, which isn't to imply that one role has any influence over the others; he is now and always has been a wonderful actor, but his storytelling skills leave a lot to be desired. Maybe he wasn't meant to be a director. Or maybe he wasn't meant to direct this particular film. Whatever the case, \\"Appaloosa\\" plunges into a story so stagnant and lifeless that it barely rises to the level of mediocrity. I expected so much more, not only because it's a genre film, but also because it employed a number of notable talents, not the least of which are Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons, and Renée Zellweger.    Taking place in 1882 in the town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, the film begins when a rancher named Randall Bragg (Irons) guns down the local sheriff and his deputy. Apparently, they had come to arrest a few of Bragg's men for murdering a mine inspector and the mine inspector's wife. Bragg believes he's above the law, claiming to have ties with the President of the United States. Desperate to bring law and order back to Appaloosa, the town leaders, led by Phil Olson (Timothy Spall), recruit two straight shooters named Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen). It's hard to know how to feel about these characters; they're engaging as mysterious figures, yet there's a mellowness that makes them seem far less interesting. Cole usually drones in western clichés while Hitch usually chimes in as his Yes Man. He also helps Cole by occasionally feeding him sophisticated words. You can't really call them friends, although they often share their feelings with one another. It would be more accurate to say that they've grown accustomed to each other's faces, which is to be expected after being partners for who knows how long.    Without warning, a woman named Allison French (Zellweger) enters the picture. Initially, no one has any idea who she is or why she came to Appaloosa. All anyone knows is that she likes Cole. A lot. But why, especially since she only just met him? It takes far too long for the film to reveal her true nature: She just wants the security of a man, specifically a man who's in charge. If it appears that Cole is no longer a powerful man of the law, she will willingly advance on someone else (Hitch learns this the hard way). What I don't understand is why she would travel to such a small Southwestern desert town to find Mr. Right. Why not go to a city with investors, bankers, and politicians, like Chicago or New York? I find it unlikely that someone so desperate for affection would settle for Appaloosa. I also find it unlikely that Cole would even consider falling in love. He's really nothing more than a hired killer for a lawless town, not at all the type to settle down into domestic life. When Allison announces that she and Cole will be moving into a little house that's under construction, I was completely taken aback; Cole would never let his happen so quickly.    The real problem here is that there's absolutely no chemistry between Harris and Zellweger. They played their parts as best they could, but something just wasn't clicking--there was no sense of romance or even raw sexual tension. The only plausible relationship in \\"Appaloosa\\" is the one between Harris and Mortensen, and even then, something isn't quite right. Their characters are men of so few words that they're hopelessly dull. When they do speak, the amateurish dialogue undermines them, making them far less appealing than they should be. Cole and Hitch had the potential to be very interesting characters, especially if the filmmakers had bothered to expand on their personal histories. We simply don't know who these men are, and that's bad because it makes what little we do know seem unimportant.    As for Jeremy Irons, there's no denying he's a master at playing villains. Indeed, Bragg is cold, arrogant, and remorseless, able to charm his way out of just about anything. His arrest and subsequent murder trail pave the way for an unavoidable shootout scene, which is resolved so quickly it's just shy of anticlimactic. What's worse is that everything building up to the shootout is agonizingly slow-paced; we see scene after scene of someone walking away before turning around, glancing solemnly at someone else, turning back, and continuing to walk away. I won't reveal which characters are involved in such scenes, although it's hardly relevant given how predictable the ending is. How much unease and regret does a western need, especially when it all comes so late in the story? And why are these emotions wasted on characters we know virtually nothing about? I'm sure some will argue that \\"Appaloosa\\" was meant to be obscure, considering the mysterious nature of the main characters. But the way I see it, there's a big difference between obscurity and something that just wasn't fully developed. This movie is clumsy, inexplicable, and boring, something I never would have expected from the likes of Ed Harris.
0375826726|2.0|I loved the first two books...the third book was a disapointment. Endless dialogue with very little plot impact and the book drags for most of its length. Eragon seems to be growing so little into a noble character and seems to still be whiny at times, worrying about being a vegeterian, whether he should kill or not (please!}.  Paolini spends TOO much time with dwarven politics, a multitude of oaths that Eragon commits himself to, too much time on the creation of the sword....with SO much detail you felt like you were in a metalurgy class....boring.  Too little fighting, and ignoring the elves battles...which should have been rich with action. Also, too little time spent learing magic, and Eragon seems to ignore charging the gems on his belt with energy....why?     Don't buy this book....wait to check it out at the library.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|First of all, David Attenborough is a terrific narrator. Had he not narrated this, I doubt I would have purchased it. He compliments documentary films THAT well, and enhances the overall enjoyment and fulfillment of viewing such works.    Now about the DVD. Wow. I give this documentary and the DVD's 5 stars easy, but there were some extremely MINOR things that I thought could have been better.    The film has coverage from quite a large amount of the Earth. From the Amazon, to the Rocky Mountains, to the artic tundra and everywhere possible in between. This film brought me videos of truly bizarre animals I'd never imagined existed. It showed a more up-close and intimate view in the life of many animals that I was already aware of. There was a point in the video that brought me down a bit, and that was the footage and story of the snow leopards of of northern Siberia whose numbers are dwindling horribly low. You get a personal look at so many different terrains, species, and ecosystems.    Footage was taken from some amazing areas of the planet that made you wonder at times how anyone even got to these places safely. The camera crew clearly goes above and beyond in order to bring us spectacles that most of us will never see in person. At the end of each episode, there is a behind the scenes look at what it took to film in certain places. You really get a better appreciation for the amount of time, work, and personal risk that each member of the film crew had put on the line. It was this portion of the DVD's alone that made me feel better about how much I had paid for them.    Picture and Sound Quality = 10/10  Even without blueray, the picture here is so amazing that it was almost as if you were there personally. Sounds were sharp and crystal clear and the images precise and spectacular. I was very impressed.    Coverage = 9/10  There were times when I wanted to see more footage of rare places that I thought they could have probably added in. Then at other times I felt they spent a little too much time on certain places or animals. Also, footage from the behind the scenes shots really only focused on one shooting session from each episode. Overall I was still impressed with the coverage of the film.    Narration = 10/10  David Attenborough, like I said before, is just terrific to listen to. The script and insight given by him to the viewer was perfect. He never overwhelms you with too much information about a particular species or scene, offering just enough dialogue to peak your curiosity and inform you, and also offering just enough quiet time for you to take it all in. Attenborough is the best.    My complaints:  Really I had only a few, and will just discuss two rather than go on and on nit-picking the every point of the film. First, there were scenes which the action happened so fast that they had to slow it down many many times in order for you to be able to clearly see what happened. This was really awesome to view. However, there were times they did this and then never actually show you the full real life speed in which it happened. A very minor complaint that really doesn't take away from the quality of the film.  My only other complaint is that if you're a hardcore outdoors/nature enthusiast, it might leave you happy, but not feeling satisfied. At the end of each episode, I was disappointed that it was over. I personally wanted more.    Conclusion:  Planet Earth is a fantastic collective look at our planet. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth it if you want to see some very impressive stuff. BBC has once again provided its audience with a superior product that easily beats out other nature documentaries. Also if you haven't checked it out yet, be sure to pick up The Blue Planet, also by BBC and narrated by David Attenborough.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A wonderfully mixed crew of nine, and raw space adventure  I am so sorry ended too soon.  Terrific set.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Alright, I am not here to take you through a step by step synopsis of the movie. I have been reading Marvel comics for as long as I remember and have basically experienced the rise and fall of their illustrious movie career. I lost faith after Spidey 3 and Ghost Rider and when I heard Iron Man was coming out I nearly hung myself. I watched it last night and I nearly cried for Marvel has redeemed itself finally. The movie was awesome, the dialog was snappy and the fact that they did not concentrate on the armor was excellent also. And when they mentioned S.H.I.E.L.D at the end, I jumped for joy because Marvel finally incorporated another part of their universe into one of their movies. Now my faith in Marvel has been restored and you know what, I started collecting and reading comic books again. I feel the fan boy coming back and I love it. I hope they don't massacre the sequel and I pray they don't massacre the Avengers, Thor and the Punisher War Zone. FANBOYS UNITE!!!!
0930289234|5.0|Not much I can say about this that hasn't been said more eloquently by others.  Watchmen changed the comic book industry.<br /><br />If you read it when it came out and have the pristine copies bagged, boarded and boxed, then go get a copy of the graphic novel so you can reread.  If you've never read, then shame on you, go read it now.<br /><br />Don't forget the movie is scheduled (if the legal issues get worked out) to come out next year.  Beat the rush an order your copy now.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|Jennifer Hudson is a terrific talent with probably the best voice in R&B today.  Its disappointing then that she doesn't get to show her true power because the tracks selected for her debut album don't allow her to truly shine.  Yes, there are some gems.  \\"Spotlight\\" is a hit, \\"Pocketbook\\" is fun, and \\"We Gon' Fight\\" soars (\\"I'm telling you..\\" doesn't count).<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are just sort of inert (i.e. \\"Can't Stop the Rain\\") or horrific (\\"What's Wrong\\" w/T-Pain, yikes!).  I liked the duet with Fantasia (\\"I'm His only Woman\\") better when Brandy and Monica sang it.<br /><br />Hopefully Jennifer will have more control over the songs the next time around and put together an album worthy of her pipes.
B0013ND30M|5.0|The story of Sleeping Beauty is a timeless classic.  And the Disney version is my favorite overall.  The demure Aurora is sweet, kind, and innocent and has a simple and understated beauty to her.  Her song \\"Once Upon A Dream\\" is one of the most beautiful songs in the Disney songbook.  The colors used in the film are stunning.  And, last but never least, the villain Maleficent is one of the most evil Disney villains ever created with the blackest of hearts.  I root for her every time I watch the movie.  Who doesn't love someone who gets all mad and exacts revenge just because she's not invited to a party?!  Talk about holding a grudge...  She truly is the Mistress of All Evil.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|just got home from his show at the 930 club....when an artist's new songs are as good as his classics live you know you are onto something...best album of 2008 so far...
031606792X|4.0|I have to admit that the final book was a bit of a departure from the rest of the series - more fantastic and less romantic - but I liked it.     I agree with the other reviewer... all the single star reviews ARE definitely killing my buzz. The book doesn't contain a powerful message for today's youth, it's just good (fun) fiction.
0439023483|5.0|I was hooked when I read the book jacket's description -- what a great concept!  Then, as I started reading, I couldn't put it down --- the characters are very well written, and the pacing keeps you going and going to find out what happens.  I appreciated that Collins did not make things too easy for the characters, and that it wasn't necessarily a happy read, which made it feel very real.  I also liked that she threw in futuristic elements, such as the man-made mutated birds, etc.  All in all, a definite thumbs up for this book -- and something I will be recommending to a lot of people.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|This is a not to be missed movie, a classic in its own time.  crisp flawless action sequences and sound make for the most enjoyment in this genre movie.  Love it, Love it Loooooooove it.

0307269752|4.0|There are two key protagonists here:  a Swedish journalist in his forties named Mikael Blomkvist, who exposes financial corruption via his gadfly news magazine, Millennium, and is successfully sued for libel.  And then there's the star:  Lisbeth Salander, one of the most original characters in years.  This emotionally-stunted, violence-inflicted computer hacker sports various tattoos and body piercings, probably suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, and has been under state guardianship in Sweden since she was not more than a child.<br /><br />When Blomkvist is enticed to live in the middle of nowhere to investigate the presumed murder of the grand-niece of the semi-retired industrialist, Henrick Vanger, a series of events begin to spiral that brings these two unlikely characters together.  The result is a series of twists and turns as they team up to get to the bottom of this forty-year-old mystery and, at the same time, enable Blomkvist to clear his name and move his leftist watchdog magazine out of the red.<br /><br />The novel really sparkles when it focuses on Lisbeth, who is unique and captivating. The revenge scene had me cheering;  I can imagine how it would play on the big screen.  The book loses its edge as the mystery begins to be solved.  No spoilers, but the evil doer, who was at least moderately fleshed out, acts and sounds like a cartoon character during the long-awaited revelation.  The novel then began to sound like an old-fashioned Perry Mason episode.<br /><br />I have read that Stieg Larsson was the editor-in-chief of Expo, an anti-racist magazine.  It makes sense, then, that the book becomes a conduit for causes that Larsson feels passionately about:  violence and subjugation of women, right-wing extremism, and the incompetency of the media.  I found the book to be a true page-turner -- I read all 467 pages at one sitting during a transcontinental flight -- with enough substance to keep me intrigued throughout.
B00005JPO1|2.0|Wow, you know when Speilberg misses he really misses.  Im in my thirties so I grew up on Indiana Jones and I was really jazzed that they were making a new one...uh until I saw the finished product that is.  Harrison Ford, geritol love him, does his very best, and frankly he is by far and away the best thing about this movie.  Let me state right off, I am no fan of Shia LaBouef, I just dont get his popularity at all, and he is totally miscast in this film, and lord, Cate Blachette is just as bad, that accent is hilarious.  Really, I cant state strongly enough how disappointed I was in this film, if it had not been for my love of Harrison Ford, I would have given it one star.  Hopefully, this is the last Indy, it's just a shame it had to end on such a lackluster film..Professor Jones deserved better, hellz I deserved better..really I want my money back..hummm..wonder who I contact.
0913866156|4.0|I don't know if the deck of such a big size was designed for big-handed people or it was intended for meditations instead of readings, but as a little-handed woman I feel a bit hard to shuffle the cards. I got used to decks that are not so big (mostly the Lo Scarabeo published ones), so it'll take time for me to get used to this one.<br /><br />As for the printing which has been complained a lot, I must say that it really is no longer a problem. The colors are okay, the lines are thin and fine. Don't be afraid to buy this deck, but consider its size anyway.
1593082479|4.0|This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island. Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well.
B001CT877Q|3.0|Others can argue over the quality of the movie. I just wanted to replace the non-anamorphic DVD with a better fit for my projector/PS3 setup. The blue-ray copy doesn't disappoint. The details are great (maybe a bit too good when it comes to the FX shots). Dark levels are good and the details definitely carry through. The movie auto starts to the menu on my PS-3. No previews or advertising is a bonus in my book. Just a press of Enter on the remote starts the movie with no fuss.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This set is the best box set I have so far. With all the different versions, I have no idea where to start. Well I got mine in August. I still have yet to watch everything on the DVDs but I'm getting there. I'm not very good with reviews but I have to say the versions are not that different from each other but still worth watching.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Being a huge Corey Taylor fan, my opinion is semi bias. One thing that I can promise you is, this album (All Hope is Gone) is nothing like their self titled album, Iowa, or Vol 3 The Subliminal Verses. Creating their fourth album with different perspective, different recording style, and brand new lyrics... has turned into a matured Slipknot masterpiece.<br /><br />These nine guys have different personalities, different recording tactics and styles. Each single member of Slipknot brings different artistic ideas to the table and to this record. One thing for sure, these guys know how to rock and can pull off any type of project that is given to them!<br /><br />All Hope is Gone is by far their best album yet! Slipknot shows you that they are a band who will never break up and better yet.... give us Maggots security that there is indeed more to Slipknot that we have not yet seen!<br /><br />All Hope is Gone not only gives us hope for future projects by Slipknot, but All Hope is Gone is a remarkable and refreshing album!
0321525655|5.0|Garr Reynolds has succinctly grasped a pernicious nettle and dislodged a few hoary myths about effective communication in his new book presentationzen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery. Realising '... that something needed to be done to end the scourge of bad PowerPoint slides and the lifeless narration that accompanies them.' (p. 6), he sets out to illustrate a simpler and more effective approach to communication through presentations.    Keep in mind that the whole thing is about communication: what you need to do and, perhaps more importantly, not do, to make communication effective.     The ten chapters are logically grouped into five areas - introduction, preparation, design, delivery and the next step.    Depending on your philosophical leanings, don't get too caught up or distracted by the 'Zen' context in which he sets out his ideas - look instead at the key ideas themselves.    In the context of planning a presentation I liked his idea of what he called \\"going analog\\" (p. 45). Get away from your computer to think about the bigger context in which your presentation is to be made, to identify your key messages and generally tease out your ideas.    One of his key points with which I heartily agree is the need to avoid inadvertently becoming a slave to the software you are using (especially PowerPoint) with its own inherent structural and process constraints.    In discussing at length presentation design (comprising some 20% of the book), Reynolds provides an extensive set of before/after examples to illustrate the key points about the use of text, images, graphics, the interaction between text and images, use of white space, balance, grids and the rule of thirds. The latter will be familiar to readers who are photographers.    A particularly helpful feature comprising Chapter 7: Sample Slides, are examples used by real world presenters , including links to relevant websites. A couple at which I have had a quick look were very worthwhile.The only downside I struck occurred in the delivery phase of the book where I thought the extensive Zen references and context tended to dominate the key messages he was trying to get across.    I strongly recommend this book to anyone who has to present something to an audience.    I can't do better than reiterate Reynolds' own advice - enjoy the journey!

B0002V7O3I|4.0|We saw this in the 80's when it 1st came out.  Now, it's just as entertaining.  A different slant on alien contact, after all if they do exist, they must have teenagers, too.  And it appears an older gent also had been contacted sometime in the past.  Very good when they begin to get the picture this is an invitation and actually build their travel craft.  Highly recommend this.  Fun for all ages...maybe a bit scary for the very young ones when the heroes 1st make alien contact.  Don't miss this alien encounter of a teenage kind.
0753513005|4.0|A very good book for those looking for down-to-earth description of the life of one of the most successful businessmen in the world today, a self-made man with a clear goal in life and creativity to support his aspirations. Entertaining and honest. Very worthwhile reading if you have interest in these things and some spare time at hand. Recommended.
0553579908|5.0|I gave `A Game of Thrones' five stars and `A Clash of Kings' exceeds the first one in every way so what do I give this book?<br /><br />I absolutely positively love this series. By far its greatest strength is in characterization. After well over 1500 total pages I've grown quite attached to Arya, Bran, Ricken and the rest of the Stark family. I truly want to see Joffrey and Cercei get their heads on a spike and I can't wait to see what Tyrion does next. The midget Tyrion is one of the most inventive and intriguing figures I have ever read. This is a fantastic character and I have to confess that when I see a Tyrion chapter coming up I'll skip forward to take a peek. Actually I found myself peeking forward quite a bit because the book is just so good. At over 960 pages this is probably the longest book I have ever read and amazingly I never wanted it to end and this is coming from a person with a very short attention span.<br /><br />Martin writes his `Song of Fire and Ice' series like a fantasy soap opera. The chapters jump back and forth between about a dozen or so different storylines so the reader never spends a whole lot of time with any individual character. Robb Stark, from the first book, doesn't appear at all but has become sort of an enigmatic figure winning battle after battle in distant lands. The climax of the book is the huge assault on King's Landing by King Stannis's fleet and it is spectacular. At the conclusion of each book the author treats the reader to several major cliffhangers to keep us eager for the next installment. Lucky for me I'm years behind in the series so I can just grab the next book as I finish the previous.<br /><br />This is the one to get. This is the best fiction book I have ever read. I loved it so much that I couldn't wait for the next one to arrive so I searched the libraries in my area for `A Storm of Swords' to tide me over until I get my own copy. I'm such a fan that I'm saddened at the thought that some day I'll be finished with the series. Unlike other fantasy writers that seem to be able to crank out a book every six months it takes Martin about 3 years to complete a book and it shows in the quality. These are not books to be plowed through and then tossed into a box. These are literary works. My highest recommendation.hed with the series.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Now this film is a bit on the odd ball side, it is funny, and I like it, I don't think it was Oscar worthy, but then I didn't think the Movie \\"Babe\\" ( the pig one ) was best Movie and it won, \\"Apollo 13\\" was much better for that yrs Oscar, but Hollywod didn't want Tom Hanks to have 3 in a row..politics...lol Anyway as I was saying it's a cute film but NOT for kids.....The \\"F\\" word is used a lot.

B00000IL29|4.0|This was the first Herbie Hancock recording I purchased after [[ASIN:B000E6EJ7U The Essential Herbie Hancock]]. I love everything Blue Note and Rudy Van Gelder, and since I was working on learning the title track, I decided to see what other sorts of tunes Herbie was composing at the time. I think this is probably one of Hancock's most approachable recordings, and while not all five tracks are sparkling lyrical wonders, there's nothing here that might be considered a \\"throw away track\\". The title track and Dolphin Dance will stay with you all day after just one listening. This is classic jazz and a great starting point for jazz and Hancock fans.

B00004SZWD|5.0|While it is certainly stating the obvious that this album is clearly a masterpiece of accomplishment, there is one song that I feel may  be too often overlooked. The song \\"If it's Magic\\" is to my ears, one of the most beautifully sung and heartfelt performances of the 20 century. I have recently reintroduced myself to \\"songs\\", and while like many double Lps there is fat on the plate, the strong tunes well out way the weaker ones. This disc will be listened to a hundred years from now as a reference to that century, and hopefully many to come!
B0000542DH|5.0|...this is turning into one of my favorite movies...  At first, i didn't enjoy it, but then i GOT it...and am falling in love with its style and characters, even though there really is NO good guy in the entire movie. But, in my opinion, this is Woody's BEST PERFORMANCE...  He, and Juliette Lewis were made for these roles...  The only \\"downer\\" is for true Tarantino fans...the \\"story\\" is from the original script Natural Born Killers by Quentin Tarantino...and to ture fans of his work, you can almost tell what lines and scenes Stoone tried to keep from the script, but put his own style into...  Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very important film that was easily overlooked that shows the world what TV and the Media really does for some peoples psyche...but I still want to see what Tarantino had visioned...

0199535566|5.0|Any reader of the novel Pride and Prejudice, be it novice or veteran, has certain expectations and apprehensions based on its incredible popularity and renown. The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, `It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?<br /><br />The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. `Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.<br /><br />Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.<br /><br />The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; \\"Lydia's use of `Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's `Abominable', Mr. Collins' `Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters.\\" This is definitely true ofAusten's unique characterizations, but this introductions `content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.<br /><br />Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy.Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions `content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.<br /><br />Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight.

0307454886|4.0|This brief novel is a fine continuation of the David Kepesh saga.  An aging man now, Professor Kepesh begins an ill-advised love affair with an inappropriately young, Latin American student.  Kepesh puts it, having an affair with someone younger doesn't make you feel young, it makes you feel older - but at least you're not sitting on the sidelines.  A meditation on desire and loss.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Here you have it, what you so called \\"fans\\" have been whining about all these years.  You have an unmolested version of one of the greatest movie trilogies ever released, and the redux version with all accompanying effects.  These are all in one package for $50... $37 if you get it from Amazon.  Heck, not 10 minutes ago, I almost ordered Episode IV and V in this format for $40.  Now, I'll get the whole set for less!    Here's the skinny.  If you aren't getting the product you want then no one is forcing you to buy it.  You're also doing a disservice to the Amazon review process by basing your review on some fantasy product that, as of now, doesn't exist.  The fact of the matter is this.      I am a huge fan of this trilogy, and this is the set I have been waiting for.  I did what all of you should have done.  I waited until it was available.

Understanding the underlying principles of who wields and forces agendas and power across the continents seems to be something that everyone ought to be interested in. Klein does a great job of tying some pretty wildly disparate ideas together and makes it not only relevant but essential to comprehending the world that we have wrought before us.

0199535523|5.0|For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a `new style of novel' designed to `suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.<br /><br />EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.<br /><br />One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.<br /><br />\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviii<br /><br />If I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch'sessay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.<br /><br />Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.<br /><br />This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenprosele language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine.

B00005JSGK|4.0|A classic John Wayne film.  This film takes place in Africa where Wayne and company have a business capturing mostly large animals for zoos.  The action sequences are well done and it's great to see the abundance of African wildlife. My 7 year old loves this show and loves the \\"pockets\\" character (played by Red Buttons) in particular.
B00005JPS8|3.0|Judging by all the accolades given to this movie you'd think it was the greatest thing ever invented by Man.  Calm down, people!  It's just a movie!  Yet another in the long, too long, line of superhero franchises.  It has its moments and Downey can be funny.  But if you want the true Man-in-high-tech-armor-fights-bad guys film than you need to see Robocop.      In truth, there are so many similarities, plot-wise, that you could easily argue it's a rehashing of the 80's classic: man is critically wounded, has a second life inside an impervious suit, finds out he was betrayed, has showdown with a similarly super-powered but much bigger foe, etc.  Sure, the special effects are kinda' cool, but Robocop's is even more impressive, especially when you consider they did it the old-fashioned way -- using real models, no CGI. And for true biting satire and gallows humor you can't beat it.  Ah, they don't make `em like they used to anymore.    PS -- It feels like the movie has a pro-military stance in that Stark's weapons are never shown to kill civilians (\\"collateral damage\\") when used by the US military, which is what I was expecting.  Instead you only see terrorists using his state-of-the-art weapons (which would be a lot less likely; terrorists tend to be pretty low-tech).  That kind of \\"black and white\\" portrayal was odd.
B00000JLWW|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since this movie came out. Moving right along, what makes this movie so interesting is that while there are fictional elements, they are mixed with historical elements as well. (So, to some extent, we are permitted to accept the fictional elements such as the Calvin, Rose, jack soap opera as real.) It is interesting how we are told the story from the 100 year old survivor Rose. So, obviously, we know that Rose will somehow survive. But that doesn't mean that Rose won't lose someone she loves. The scenery and outfits are beautiful. And although the movie is over 3 hours long, somehow, it never seems to drag. The story seems to move at a realistic pace (rather than everything being crammed to fit into a 2 hour slot). While Rose and Jack are the stars, other characters make good use of their screen time. (The unsinkable Molly Brown who comes into money, but never sacrificed herself or her moral values, and kept her redneckish charm, and also the virtuous and honorable Thomas Andrews to name 2.)<br /><br />While Calvin is not seen in a favorable light often, his character is at least a tad grayer that we would probably like to admit.(I actually found Rose's mother to be more repulsive.) Basically, Rose's mother (now broke) wants Calvin to marry Rose to reestablish themselves financially. Calvin, despite his faults is willing to do so. In all honesty, Calvin starts off no worse than anyone else in his position would probably be. Rose then begins her relationship involved with Jack, and Calvin gets abusive to the point where he nearly kills her. I'm not trying to defend his abuse of Rose, or for that matter firing several gunshots in a rage. But if we wish to throw a small tad of understanding on the table (at least before he gets abusive), Rose's mother was asking Calvin to reestablish themselves financially. And then Rose runs around with Jack. A whiter Calvin may have decided that he shouldn't waste anymore time here.<br /><br />Moving on, there is some generous time of just getting to know everyone, but this also provides a creepy suspense. (Obviously, we already know the ship is going to sink.) At about the 1/2 way point, a conversation between Rose and Thomas Andrews reminds us that there are only enough life boats for 1/2 the passengers. We can also see that Thomas Andrews wanted enough for everyone, but 'certain powers' didn't take his concerns seriously.<br /><br />There are some romantic moments between Jack and Rose, and then the Titanic crashes. (While some people would pick and find someone to blame, the movie seems to not point the blame at any one party. Not even 100 % towards Mr. Ismay who came out splattered with mud the most.) In the event we forgot the conversation between Rose and Mr. Andrews, Thomas faces Rose again and reminds us.<br /><br />One phenomenal thing about this movie is that it shows us the true horror of people dying. (Unlike many movies that glorify people getting killed.) Interestingly, the ship sinks for an actual hour or so. This is great in that we get to see the panic, tragedy, and horror of the crew knowing that less than 1/2 are going to survive. Rose finds herself not only in this situation, but in the climax in her situation between her mother and Calvin. (There is a predictable, but still shaking moment when Rose says: \\"Goodbye mother,\\" which infers that they will probably never see each other again.)<br /><br />Moving on, we are permitted sympathy for even characters we never met as they face their probable death . Their different ways of facing it are interesting. (Story telling, playing music, simply waiting, or in one case, having a brandy.)<br /><br />Most of you probably already know the personal tragedy Rose faces. But moving back to the present, it is interesting how the Bill Paxton character suddenly realizes that there is more to life than ourselves. Overall, it's a phenomenal romance (in a historical setting) that reminds us not only ofthe horror of people dying, but that there is more to life than our own existence.is more to life than our own existence.

9626344679|5.0|I adore audio books and always have one playing away in my car during my commute to work; -- so when I went hunting to purchase a new unabridged audio edition on CD of Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, I was quite surprised to learn that my choices were very few at exactly two; a Blackstone AudioBooks, Inc (2008) read by Johanna Ward and a Naxos AudioBooks (2007) read by Juliet Stevenson. My first choice was of course the Juliet Stevenson version, for what Janeite could ever forget her outrageous performance as Mrs. Elton in the 1996 movie adaptation of Emma?  My abject apologies to Johanna Ward, who I am sure must be a very fine reader since she has several audio books to her credit, but the thought of listening to Mansfield Park read by Mrs. Elton just intrigued me and gave me the giggles. If anyone could liven up Mansfield Park, reputed to be Jane Austen's most complex and dark novel, she could!<br /><br />Being a reader for an audio book is not an easy task since so many different `performances' are required to distinguish each of the characters for the listener. I have found through a course of trial and error that I enjoy audio books read by classically trained actors. Juliet Stevenson fills this qualification perfectly for me using every inch of her Royal Shakespearean Company training. Her understanding of Jane Austen's use of language and her true British accent added greatly to my enjoyment of this fine production.<br /><br />Naxos AudioBooks has made quite a solid commitment to present quality productions of all of Jane Austen's six major novels in unabridged and abridged formats. You can read about all of their recordings on their excellent web site and listen to a PodCast of an interview of Juliet Stevenson as she discusses her involvement in the audio recordings and her affinity to Jane Austen. Of note is the free download for this month of Milton's L'Allegro read by Samantha Bond (Maria Bertram in Mansfield Park 1983 and Mrs. Weston in Emma 1996)<br /><br />It has been said that Jane Austen often read her writings to her family as entertainments. Her beautiful use of language which just flows effortlessly is completely suited for the spoken word. When you add to perfection an accomplished actress with a keen sensitivity to Jane Austen's particular style, the results truly are remarkable./><br />It has been said that Jane Austen often read her writings to her family as entertainments.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|I am hypnotized by this Duffy. Not in a hypnotize by biggie kind of way, but in a 60's downtown gretna way. This CD is pure as snow before people drive on it and make it dirty or relieve themselves on it. I was introduced to Duffy, like most others, when I heard the song Mercy. I go to the gym four days a week (six when I have a date) and Mercy is a great song to go 14 miles on the treadmill to. I just put it on repeat and go. My favorite track though is not Mercy, which probably surprises you after what I just said about it. I like Rockferry. That track takes me back to Gretna in the 60s when double decker buses drove people around and dropped them off at the bowling for a night of shenanigans and tomfoolery.     I'm a really good bowler. Our team took 4 games out of a possible 4 last night. That's 100%!!!! We did the same thing last week. Can I pick up a 7-10 split? Are kids with syrup on their faces annoying? We had a bowling duel for the ages that Duffy might as well be the soundtrack four. Burns, Kroll, J-abs and I were bowling in the Eastern Nebraska Kind of Professional Bowling league for Gretna. We called ourselves Asschowder (big surprise). We bowled Ashland and let me tell you that Burns just didn't like Ashland. He called it trashland (that's ice cold). We all bowled over 250 and beat them by 435 pins. We let them bowl three balls at a time in the last game just to try and keep it close. Don't let your kids see that ever again! Let's just say average bowled for Trashland.    Get Rockferry now!!!

0061142026|5.0|If you like fantasy stories filled with magic, adventure and romance, but are getting sick and tired of boring, long-winded fantasy epics, then look no further than \\"Stardust.\\" There are no long histories, family trees or endless descriptions of culture, landscapes and back-story. This is just a sweet, simple fairytale told by a great storyteller. Though be warned - the original fairytales were not written for children, and \\"Stardust\\" follows in their literary footsteps, by including several violent, sensual and bittersweet scenes. It might be tempting to read this book aloud to children (particularly if you've seen the recent movie adaptation), but this is something I would strongly advise against!<br /><br />Set in the Victorian Era out in the English countryside, the town of Wall is named so because of the simple-looking wall that divides our world from the realm of Faerie. The two worlds are kept strictly separate (or so the town officials would like to believe) except for a few days every nine years when a faerie marketplace crosses the wall, and Wall itself is turned into a bustling metropolis as travelers from around the world arrive to consort with the fey-folk. Gaiman pours delicious detail into this mingling of two worlds, describing the fairy markets with such obvious relish that you'll be surprised how long the book takes to get to the \\"meat\\" of the story in the quest narrative (not that this is a bad thing).<br /><br />It is at one such meeting of worlds that young Tristian Thorn is conceived. Eighteen years later (and unaware of his faerie-heritage) Tristian has been raised by his father Dunstan Thorn and fallen in love with Victoria Forester, a girl hopelessly out of his league. However, he manages to wrangle an agreement with her: for her hand in marriage, he will fetch her the falling star that they've both just seen fall from the sky.<br /><br />Little does he know, that the falling star has been witnessed by several others in Faerie: a witch that desires the star to rejuvenate her and her sisters to their youth, and the princely sons of the realm of Stormhold, who are after a gemstone to solidify their claim to the throne, which is currently worn around the star's neck. These various story threads gradually converge as the story goes on, though the tale mainly focuses on the tempestuous relationship that forms between Tristian and Yvaine the star (who naturally takes the form of a beautiful young woman).<br /><br />There are little subplots and threads of other stories strewn throughout the book, quite reminiscent of Michael Ende's use of the phrase: \\"that is another story and shall be told another time,\\" in [[ASIN:0525457585 The Neverending Story]], or of the collected fairytales of the Brothers Grimm, whose stories have a variety of characters who pop in and out of their tales, seemingly at random. But Gaiman's range of characters and little \\"plot tangents\\" serve to give one the sense that there is more going on in the world than the trials and tribulations of our two main characters.<br /><br />If anything, the ending is a little anti-climactic (especially when compared to the aforementioned movie version) and the final line of the book doesn't pack *quite* the bittersweet punch that I think Gaiman intended, but ultimately this is a lovely little story that wouldn't feel out of place next to Christina Rossetti's [[ASIN:0486280551 Goblin Market and Other Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)]] or the works of Lord Dunsany. If you've read anything by Lord Dunsany (a forerunner to Tolkien himself) then there's no reason not to enjoy \\"Stardust\\" - in fact Neil Gaiman himself pays homage to this early fantasy-author by quoting his famous \\"beyond the fields we know\\" phrase from [[ASIN:034543191X The King of Elfland's Daughter (Del Rey Impact)]] (and mentions the author in his dedication).<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" has recently been adapted into a movie, which in many ways improves on several aspects of its source material,particularly in a more climactic finish and the fleshing out of minor characters (although others suffer, such as Victoria, who really isn't such a bad sort in the book, but is portrayed as a spoilt little snot in the film). But [[ASIN:B000WZAE1I Stardust (Widescreen Edition)]] was filmed with a more tongue-in-cheek air, in the tradition of [[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)]], and looses some of the mystery and delicacy that Gaiman infuses his story with: let's call it the \\"fey quality.\\" And though the ending of the film was more satisfying, it's not quite as poignant or thought-provoking.

0375826726|5.0|I was introduced to Eragon by my little brother while I was my parents on vacation. I began reading it from lack of anything else to do and was hooked. When Eldest came out I devoured it in short order as well. I was disappointed when I got to the end of Eldest and found out I would have to wait. I still how ever found this book enthralling and didn't want to put it down the whole time I was reading it. I had to know what happened next. Many of these reviews slam this book pretty hard but you have to realize that these books fall under Juvenile fiction and therefore are not supposed to be overly complicated by heavy plots. While the book was filled with a lot of dialog that sometimes I did want to skip over I realized that it tied things together which were left rather open in the first two books and furthered the depths of each character. I also noticed the parallels between these books and those of Tolkien and McCaffery, but take in to consideration that these were his influences. Not to mention that there aren't to many original ideas out there any more as everything has been don at least once. Your best bet is to just lose your self in the pages and flow of ideas and images and just enjoy it for what it is a very good book.

B001BR5F4C|5.0|This is by far the best picture and audio quality of any blu-ray movie so far!
B000GRUMPU|5.0|In this movie, you follow the actors through escaping an overturned ship. There are several scenes that tug on your heart strings, and others that make you jump up and down in your seat in suspense. I am a fan of Kurt Russel, and when I saw that he was in this movie, I made sure to watch it.  It's a remake of the original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" and it definitely is not as good as the original. It deviated from the original plot slightly, but still followed the main ideas.  However, I still enjoyed the movie due to the updated actors and the special effects used within it.
B001FEA9QU|4.0|I've come to fully appreciate Metallica in very recent months.   Funny, actually from the game Guitar hero-I became completely addicted to \\"One\\".   Since that time, I've been studying their music to completely understand their genius in how they started a genre.         Before I purchased this album, I listened to tons of their music, and clearly love \\"One\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" the best.   So when I actually heard the tracks from Death Magnetic, I was so happy to hear some really amazing songs. Best of all, I think the songs on this album not only bring forth their old-school signature sound, but infuse some modern elements of metal.   Even though I'm also a Nu Metal fan-I LOVE Thrash, Death Metal and especially guitar solos and that is in fact what I love most about Metallica-solos and completely addicting hooks.  Kirk Hammett is a guitar god.     I waited till just the last few days to buy this album, mostly because I wanted to hear all of the buzz.   I wanted to be just as impressed with this album as with \\"And Justice\\"  and sure enough, it does not disappoint.   I'm already in awe of the opening hook from \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" and \\"Cyanide\\" has a really an interesting rhythm chord progression that keeps it in your head.  Oh and I really love the time signature changes in \\"Cyanide\\", more metal musicians are starting to take advantage of this simple but effective technique.    So why not a 5???-I don't mean to bash Rick Rubin, but his productions tend to be just a bit overproduced.   I was so disappointed in the latest Linkin Park.   Mr Rubin may think that he is enhancing the sound with studio technology, but I think he takes the rawness and edge away from the sound.  The distortion is just not heard, the vocals are a bit too loud compared to the guitar tracks and the transitions are just a bit too clean.
0446402389|5.0|I've been reading a lot of thriller/mystery novels lately, and this one by Smith is the best of them all.  It is a political thriller, crime mystery, character-development love story all wrapped up in to one.  And, more importantly, none of the three \\"types\\" of genre represented in Smith's book suffer for being put together.     As a political thriller, the book shines with its great portrayal of characters both heroic and flawed, brave and terrified.  It captures well the double speak and justifiable \\"paranoia\\" that individuals under repressive regimes like that of Stalin had to contend with.  For fans of books like Sofia Petrovna or more recent movies like The Lives of Others, set in East Germany, this book will certainly strike a chord.      As a crime mystery, the book is equally interesting, though this part of the plot at times fades into the background.  Indeed, the idea of Leo, the main character, being on the hunt for the serial killer is largely dropped for quite some time at the beginning.  One almost forgets about it, though the development of the other lines in the story are so interesting that it is not really something that would bother one (unless you really only like the serial killer mystery genre).  Granted, not as much time is spent on developing the crimes, crime scenes, or the killer's personality as is perhaps the case in some other books that are more limited in their scope.  Still, enough is included on the crime front to make it a compelling case.    The love-story element is also rather engaging, certainly not crossing over into anything like a mushy, romance-novel style affair.  The love story works especially because it helps further the political thriller element, as the relationship between Leo and his wife really has to overcome many obstacles created by the repressive society they live in.              First and foremost, this book is a political thriller.  And that is where a lot of Smith's efforts at high-quality writing shine through.  Beyond the other two genres mentioned above, the book might also be of interest to those who like historical fiction.
3836503050|5.0|Without any knowledge; yet a curious fascination for a bygone era, I perused many of the illustrators famous for their cheesecake-girl-next-door pin ups of the fifties on the web. Gil Elvgren came up tops! As Rockwell held a mirror up to the American public, Elvgren manage to evoke Rockwellesque subtleties into his work too. Your eyes are attracted to the girls, however, other elements like a dog, a turtle, a prop like a diary, add to the charm of the work and to the total innocence of the girls. Living in the current \\"Raunch Culture\\" where female nudity is pervasive, this book transports you back to another time where the girls exude a level of desirability that Elvgren perfectly captured in his work. The luscious and lovingly delivered colour plates (some 500 of them) demonstrate Elvgren's evolution into the auteur of pin up illustrators, as he progressively developed real depth into to his work. This book is a perfect introduction to an incredible genius and an incredible artform
0061564893|5.0|A must read and a corrective of the present history of the discovery of America by Columbus.   The cruelness of the emperor and his vision of a great \\"market\\" and \\"friends\\" across the seas are truly fascinating and understandable, yet frightening.   The \\"proofs\\" and evidence presented make this the most wonderfully believable part of history not yet exposed.
0425105709|5.0|[[ASIN:0425105709 One, Two, Buckle My Shoe (Hercule Poirot)]]<br /><br />This book is a thoroughly enjoyable read with elements that still resonate today.  Hercule Poirot is in rare form as he makes a dreaded trip to the dentist and finds himself involved in more than he bargained for.  In typical Poirot fashion he is soon hot on the trail of insurrectionists, murder most foul with a plot to overthrow the British government thrown in for good measure. Poirot's ability to appreciate how his peculiar foibles make him the object of scorn by some members of a household in the countryside he visits during his investigation  make this Christi novel different from others where Poirot seems to take himself much too seriously.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie was amazing!!! it was so truely sad what will smith's character had to go through to survive, all the pain he must have felt along the way, but he came out on top at the end ad it was great!!!!
B0019IB26I|5.0|This two-disk set is a must have for fans of John Mayer. Whether you love his, acoustical arrangements, pop songs or the sound of the John Mayer Trio, you will find, \\"Where the Light Is\\" a perfect addition to your John Mayer collection. For those new to the sound and style of John Mayer, this set is a perfect introduction to his music.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, I believe Mr. Mayer to be one of the most talented musicians on the stage. His mastery of the guitar allows him to fuse traditional blues, jazz and pop sounds into compilations with broad appeal. Fans who enjoy the styles of James Taylor, Dave Matthews and Jimi Hendrix will find John Mayer worthy of their time.
B001AJVR5M|4.0|I have to say that I am quite impressed with these young musicians.  I purchased this CD for my daughter not really thinking I would enjoy most of the music on it.  The CD is all pop/rock and the worst word used on it  is \\"sucks\\" on one song!  I really hope the Jonas Brothers keep their \\"good\\" kid image so young girls and boys have a pop/rock group to look up to.  I would highly recommend this CD.  My husband even liked a couple of songs and he only listens to rock music.  He is a very harsh critic so this really says something positive about the Jonas Brothers talent...very good!
B001BR3ORC|4.0|fantastic.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|For all the fans that are complaining about their progression on this album, you must be insane. I was just telling a friend before \\"Attack and Release\\" came out that I loved the Black keys music but their music was too redundant. It's not even a dramatic evolution in their sound, it's more of maturation. I always though that the Black keys were super talented and made great songs, but unfortunately they had like 4 albums of songs that sounded pretty-much the same. I love them to death, but they started to get boring. And by the grace of God they got a talented producer that was able to put their talent to proper use and pull a sound out of them that could elevate them as artist. This album is a blessing; it has much more depth and body to it. It shakes off the stale hipster aura and stands on its own legs as underdog masterpiece. Sometimes I think alternative music fans should really learn how to grow with the bands instead of being stuck in a remedial state of mind.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This album is amazing- Bon Iver's music is a fantastic combination of acoustic blends and layers upon layers of warm harmonies.  He sings with such passion that you want to listen to the entire album over and over again. I highly recommend this album.
B000JMKOI2|2.0|\\"Factotum\\" is a story that goes nowhere but around and around.<br />It's the same thing: Henry gets a job, gets a chick, tons of drinking and getting drunk,loses or quits the job, is poor, gets another job, a new chick, more drinking, loses or quits the job....etc....<br />\\"Ham on Rye\\" and \\"Post Office\\" were much better.
B000F5FNSE|5.0|The book came in fantastic condition and my Grandson was delighted with his Birthday gift....thanks...
B001C3KCSY|5.0|A lot of alternative music fans bitch and complain about their favorite bands \\"changing\\" and their \\"old stuff being better.\\" These statements have become cultural cliches and hard to take seriously especially when the person criticizing is wrong. As another reviewer said, just because the album isn't exactly what you want to hear doesn't make it a bad album. The Kings deliver quality music here, with tracks like \\"17\\" \\"Be Somebody\\" and \\"Sex on Fire\\" being some of the best of their career. I do believe this album is for a maturer audience. Polished doesn't always equal = bad. Maturation is very healthy for music artist. I'm guessing a lot of these so called fans must be really boring people because alternative music fans seem to be obsessed with hearing the same types of songs over and over and over again without any kind of evolution or progression. Diversity in one's music career genuinely shows their strength as an artist. Most of these redundant copy-car hipster bands will die out, be forgotten and leave no legacy, but the Kings obviously wants to be more than that. I bet many of these whining fans haven't gone to the basics and listened to the pioneers... the Creedence Clearwater Revival and Buffalo Springfield era... music is so much more than a gimmick and a fad. I just wish people could appreciate its art more often.
B000005J56|5.0|Despite listening to this album perhaps a million times, it never fails to put a tear in my eye while making me feel immensely happy at the same time.  Heck, it sounds better with every listen.  What else can you ask for in a record?    In the liner notes, Ry Cooder writes that listening to music should be approached like taking part in a treasure hunt.  This record is a gold mine.
1594481717|5.0|This book is an excellent argument for the need for creativiity, decision making and other right brain functions in our current economic system. It points out that left brain functions can be sent overseas or computerized but the right brain functions add the most value. An easy read. We used it for the foundation of an arts leadership class.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Although the trailer doesn't make it seem that exciting this is a really funny and creative movie. Highly reccommended!
B000RJO578|3.0|Simon Pegg oozes hilarity. He is a natural comedian, and he doesn't even need to try. I've always found that British comedies are much funnier and wittier than American ones. I think it has something to do with their overly dry humour and their love for the F-bomb. It just sounds better coming from a Brit.     Anywho, Hot Fuzz starts off somewhat normal but then halfway through the film, it gets a tad weird. What you think the plot is about is not what it really is, and it just comes at you all of a sudden from a million different directions. It's just weird. Oh, and the excess of blood and gore is also a cool and unexpected treat.    But it is also funny, for the most part. The gags are funny, the characters are even funnier and the film is stylised in the same vein of Shaun of the Dead, which is by far funnier than this. They even reused a few of the same actors. You gotta love the little cameo with Bill Nighy, that guy is just fabulous.  Nick Frost is also a great funny sidekick. I was also pleased to see Timothy Dalton in this. He has a nice little role here as well.     The film certainly keeps you entertained and interested. Its a sort of who-dunnit with a funny twist. If you love British humour, you will probably like this movie.
B000B8QF00|4.0|This is a good collection of all of her music to date. No hits seem to be missing on this one.
B00011D1RC|5.0|Lewis Stone with his twisted and burned up face, that looks bright red when he shows his right profile, steals the show if you're looking for the freakish side to pre-Code films.  They would not have allowed him to wear that makeup had the film been made a year later.  It's still pretty startling and symbolizes, I suppose, Janus, the face that looks backward and forward at the same time: a suitable pendant for the mise en scene of the GRAND HOTEL, where nothing changes, everything is always the same, and yet everything happens if you look at it from a different angle.<br /><br />It's sort of a mishmash of acting styles, but in general terms we are seeing the final bid of silent acting as a viable art form.  Garbo in particular seems to think she is still in silents, as does Wallace Beery, and their wonderful faces are always exquisitely placed within the frame.  The brothers Barrymore are in there trying to make sense of modern-day \\"talkie acting\\"--unfortunately this gives Lionel the permission he's seeking to go all over the place with those ridiculous moans, snorts and giggles.  Really it's enough to make you wonder why all the characters (but Beery) think of him as such a cute \\"odd duck.\\"  He's about as cute as a toad.  John Barrymore, on the other hand, breaks on through into the slick modernity of screen acting, calming down his larger than life gestures and sublimating them to a bigger scheme of the what the story demands.  (Which is peculiar in many ways and is about as far from the present-day demands of the three act structure as you couldm imagine.)  His part is the most difficult as well as the most integrated, but he has to show us that he has fallen in love with Garbo's ballerina at the same time that he is developing some sort of erotic/romantic/paternal feelings for the young stenographer Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford).  All the stories revolve around him, and this is possible because of the bizarre \\"classlessness\\" of his Baron.  Is the Baron a real gentleman, or are his aristocratic affectations part of the con artist's resume?  This question is, exquisitely, never answered and the ambiguity is at the heart of the Weimar romance.<br /><br />Of course things were changing in Berlin in the very year GRAND HOTEL was being produced.  Here and there you could swear you are seeing the up and coming signs of Hitler's reign coming on: in the scene, for example, where the grown bellmen line up for their shift and turn their hands palm upwards and down for cleanliness inspection.<br /><br />And yes, Joan Crawford is pretty great here--though again Lionel Barrymore's relentless hamming prevents me from actually believing Flaemmchen honestly cares for him--though even if she's just after his money, the storyline still works.are his aristocratic affectations part of the con artist's resume?

031606792X|5.0|I've got to say that, having NEVER rated a book here before, I just couldn't resist once I read those less than 'glowing' reviews of this book, and, basically of this Twilight Saga.  Come on people!  THESE ARE THE BEST!  It's fiction!  Didn't you just want to read it to enjoy being absorbed in a fantastic STORY of make believe?  I think too many are over analyzing this series.  I'm a voracious reader, and, at my teenaged daughter's promptings, decided to read this series of books.  I've thanked her daily this past week as I devoured all four of them within 7 days!  If you're a 'hopeless romantic' - which I'm NOT embarassed to say that I am - and someone who loves to read as a fun, entertaining escape from reality, then I couldn't recommend these books any more than I have.  And believe me, I've been recommending them to everyone I've been speaking to this last week.  I couldn't get enough of them, and know that the characters that Stephenie has created here will remain in my heart for YEARS to come.  I don't care what anyone may think about me with my 'old-fashioned' morals and ideas, but I loved that she waited until AFTER she was married to engage in sex, that she loved being a mother, and that she adored Edward and her 'family'.  I agree that she's now got forever to go to college and enjoy anything else her immortality can offer her.  So, bottom line for me...it was a TERRIFIC BOOK, and, to quote the name of the last chapter, \\"The Happily Ever After\\" that I, personally, was wishing for on this AMAZING saga.  WAY TO GO Stephenie!!  Can't wait to see the movie!!
B00151HZME|5.0|The presence of a Boy George wanna-be and a Molly Ringwald clone on the cover ought to be a major tip-off that \\"Saturdays=Youth\\" is M83's loving (and only semi-ironic) tribute to the 1980s and to the movies of that decade's leading youth-cinema auteur, John Hughes.     But this is no mere exercise in lame nostalgia. M83 (actually Anthony Gonzalez) treats his subjects - youthful heartbreak and teenage drama - with more affection and reverence than winking condescension. And as a bonus, the songs and production are thrillingly good - from the waves of glossy synths and whispery vocals to the electronic punch of the drum machines.     It's weird to think that Gonzalez is himself only in his mid-20s, which means he was a mere infant during the actual decade he so clearly and nostalgically loves. But who really cares when the results are this consistently great? Fans of New Order, OMD, the Cocteau Twins and the soundtracks to \\"The Breakfast Club\\" or \\"Pretty in Pink\\" will find \\"Saturdays=Youth\\" to be just their cup of tea.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|It's a tough thing growing old!......and this film hasn't grown old gracefully. Tim Burton tried so hard to make the film the fans wanted to see, but the 1966 TV show is still present to a degree in this \\"not so dark\\" romp through Gotham City! I do enjoy this film despite it's flaws, but you have to remember at the time this was fairly new territory. I went to see this opening night and it was a grand experience for the most part although I was not completely happy with the film!<br /><br />Keaton who fans and critics scoffed at for being picked to play the caped crusader is actually pretty good and way better than Kilmer or the abysmal Clooney! Jack Nicholson's Joker is a slightly more deranged Caesar Romero, his perfomance is sometimes genius, but ultimately it's not that memorable because of the uneven tone of the film. A tone that switches from dark to camp to Hollywood and back again. If there is one consistent critique that remained the same in the last 20 years, it's that the Prince music is horrible and inappropriate in this film! Making the art gallery scene one of my least favorite parts of the movie!<br /><br />OK enough already, the film is still pretty entertaining earning a 3 1/2 star rating from me and this two disc edition is awesome! Great DVD transfer and lots of Batman goodies to look at!
0670018651|2.0|One liners about how bad certain perfumes smell isn't really what I would expect from a book that takes itself so seriously as to be titled \\"Perfumes: The Guide\\".  I was hopeing for something informative.  Instead I got two divas with their claws out.    Yes, they're clever.  They're also so superior it's nauseating.      The information in the begining of the book was helpful, I enjoyed that.  But the reviews were a waste of time.  My issue is not with how many stars they give a certain perfume or whether or not I agree with how much they liked it (or hated it so much they insulted and mocked it), I just would have enjoyed a little more subtance and a little less venom.    And for the people who were insuled by the bad reviews of their perfumes, I can see why you would be.  This book is very insulting to what it does not worship.  I can understand why someone who enjoys, and smells like a perfume that gets ridiculed in this book could take that a little personally.
B000002OX7|5.0|Well folks, at a stop over in Hodgenville, Kentucky (courting the Lincoln Cabin Indepedents), they played my campaign song, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" by The Who. Oh, I am sure you've heard it. And, any day now, I expect The Who's lawyer to contact me and serve a cease and desist order not to use the song in my campaign. This is modern day politics folks. I am but a victim of the overbearing burearacy that has taken over creative compositions in the public arena. Do not fret. All that will change when I am in office. And, it doesn't matter who's in the Congress and Senate. No. I have spirit guides and, if they fail, there is always the handy dandy veto. Face it. You are impressed at this point.<br /><br />But, no matter. I am here to review a classic in the rock arena. I have always been reluctant to review the really big, classic profferings for some reason. Perhaps it's because so many have zeroed in and written reviews. What could a poor Seer add to all that has been said before about this? Well, I'll tell you..... PLENTY!<br /><br />This is The Who, at perhaps, their most rocking and most soothing best. It stands the test of time, and that is due, largely in part, to Peter Townsend's musical creativity as well as the subject matter. This is not shallow rock, not by a long stretch. There are windows to see into each song, and they give you some other aspect with which to view the contents. It is a maze, of sorts, but by invoking the spirit of Meher Baba in \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" we are faced with a very interesting spiritual exercise, to say the least.<br /><br />\\"Baba O'Reilly\\", beginning with that constant organ loop at the inception. Creative. Who else do you know that would begin a song this way? But it entails a journey with a righteous fiddle ending. It is teenage wasteland, after all. But, do they mean drugs (!) or is it, rather, the waste of youth propelled towards the common, the status quo? These are questions that need to be asked. But, there also is conveyed the freedom of the mind with:<br /><br />\\"I don't have to fight, to prove I'm right...<br />I don't need to be forgiven\\".<br /><br />This, after all, is the creed of a free mind. Spiritual in essence, other's concerns about you affect you not. Believe it or not. The spirituality continues with the hard rocking \\"Bargain\\". Most people will say it's about a love of his life. But, look deeper. Not only does he not qualify who or what he's taking about, but, looking on, one has to wonder.<br /><br />\\"I sit lookin 'round, I look at my face in the mirror,<br />I know I'm worth nothing, without you.<br />And like one and one don't make two, one and one make one,  And I'm looking for that free ride to me, I'm lookin for you\\".<br /><br />A woman, or an ode to God? One must ponder.<br /><br />I must insert here, that all the melodies are righteously right on. This is the band at their most vital. Their best. Everything falls into place like an intricate jigsaw puzzle. You get the easy comfort and bluesy acoustic guitar in \\"Love Ain't for Keepin\\", (which is about a woman) and really clever lyrics contained in that insistent rocker \\"My Wife\\". It really sounds like this women becomes possessed with ultimate revenge based on her imaginative thoughts. The lengths this man will go through to escape is strictly astounding.<br /><br />We then get to the grandiose, but sad ode of \\"The Song is Over\\". Regrets and sadness, the Who have a way of conveying it gloriously somehow. A sad, but noble, end of a relationship. \\"Gettin' In Tune\\" begins easy with a soft piano intro, but then comes the band, with Keith Moon leading the charge. This, and the manic \\"Goin' Mobile\\" (which reflects the freedom of youth as an escape) are a good prolougue to what comes next.<br /><br />One of the most interesting tunes on this album (I feel) is \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". Townsend sends you to the essence of the real soul, the one that lies underneath, hidden from society. It is the complexity of the individual thatis so notable here.<br /><br />\\"No one knows what it's like, to be hated<br />to be fated, to telling only lies.<br />But my dreams they aren't as empty<br />as my conscience seems to be,<br />I have hours, only lonely<br />My love is vengeance that's never free\\"<br /><br />What is observable and what's inside an individual is a very complex state. Townsend reflects this in a most succinct way.<br /><br />\\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is the anthem that I enjoy so much. And, face it, no matter how much we sing this, there is always someone else coming down the runway to fool us again. Is there no escape? You can escape, the best you can. But, this song, although a revelation of freedom, ends with the fact that everything's the same, no matter how we want it not to be so. \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss\\". True. And the pitfalls and pratfalls of bosshood seem to be an ever constant thing. Unfortunately.<br /><br />For the completist, the rest of the selections pertain to other things Townsend was working on throughout this era. More introspection is given with \\"Pure and Easy\\". The perfect nirvanic ring \\"There once was a note- listen\\". And a continuance with \\"The Naked Eye\\". Everything may be fine in what you see physically, but don't forget about your other eye. All these extra tunes add a wonderful cadence to an iconic album.<br /><br />This one is a classic rock album folks, make no mistake about it. It is amazing to see the growth of the Who as to when they started out (revolutionary- destroying guitars and kicking drum kits off the stage), to a sense of purpose and learning and yearning. They became craftsmen in the process and wonderfully creative and imaginitive. This album is definitely one of the top, definitive, rock albums of all time. Your collection will suffer greatly if you don't have it.<br /><br />Well, I better go now. I just received a subpoena from The Who. Guess I'll have to use another song. Do you think they would let me use \\"My Generation\\"?<br /><br />Times are rough in the heartland..... Metamorphoto telling only lies.

B000B5XOYI|5.0|Before I reviewed any of these earlier Batman films, I wanted to watch them again. It's hard to not compare them to the newer \\"Nolan\\" films, but in their time most of them were very good and entertaining! This box set features all four of the Batman films from 1989 through the 90's on individual two disc editions. The packaging is solid and I like the films being in individual cases. The DVD transfers and extras are excellent and if your a fan of the series, it's well worth picking up. I will review each film as I watch them and add ratings to this review, but will do full reviews on the individual releases.<br /><br />I have not seen The Dark Knight yet,(I know I know!) and I wanted to watch these films again before seeing the \\"new and improved\\" version of Batman (The Dark Knight). I think when watching these movies we have to remember that Batman in the late 30's was just a 10 cent comic book for kids, it was many years later was the elaborate back story and psychological aspects were added to the character. I think Burton was trying to capture the feeling of the first comic....he did, but unfortunately some of the TV show found it's way in! Don't get me wrong, I love the TV show for what it is, campy, over the top and fun! It just doesn't work well with the original vision of The Dark Knight.<br /><br />So please take off your jaded judgmental hats and enjoy these films for what they are and remember without the original Superman and Batman movies, films like Blade, Spider-man, Iron Man, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight may have never got off the ground!<br /><br />1) Batman - 3 1/2 stars<br />2) Batman Returns - 3 3/4 stars<br />3) Batman Forever - 2 1/2 stars<br />4) Batman and Robin - 1 1/2 stars
B000VZBCWE|5.0|As someone who never paid the slightest attention to Queen or Freddie Mercury, I was absolutely blown away when I saw portions of this concert on my local PBS station.  So, I bought this disc from Amazon and I am very pleased to have it in my collection.  It includes not only the wonderful concert in Montreal but also a second DVD with a fund raiser in London that is truly awe inspiring.  I cannot recommend this too highly: if you are a fan you will love it.  If you have never seen or heard of this group, you will become a fan!
B000I2J6K0|3.0|I'm only about 6 weeks pregnant but I decided to go ahead and try to find a comparable workout video to what I've already been doing. With my last pregnancy I used Denise Austin and I was really unimpressed; however, this one was pretty decent. She does go from one move to the next somewhat fast and it doesn't give you much time to get your props ready. Once you've gone through the DVD once though you'll be prepared for the next time. The production value isn't very good either. It was definitely just shot in her home, but you still get a really good workout. I would probably give it one more star if it had other women in different stages of their pregnancy. This only has Denise herself doing the entire workout. I would recommend it though in addition to some brisk walking a few times a week.
B0017XOF5A|5.0|This is a fantastic addition to the Stargate family, it definitely helps close the Ba'al chapter, and hopefully keep the SG-1 franchise alive and breathing. If your a fan of the either SG series then this is a required addition to your Blue Ray collection!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|It's hard describing the \\"Torchwood\\" series.  \\"Sort of like 'X-Files' when it first came out\\" just seems so inadequate.  Yes, it's SciFi, but I compare it more to \\"The Sopranos\\" because the acting, writing, storylines and characters are so very absorbing.  Like Tyler Perry's movies, the stories are amazingly creative and sometimes you laugh; sometimes you cry.  So much happens in each episode that you MUST pause the DVD when taking a refrigerator break.  My one caution is that you should watch two episodes before giving up on \\"Torchwood.\\"  Then you'll be hooked!

B000NY133G|4.0|People can throw stones at the mysticism all they want but the truth is The Secret can help you have a more positive and productive outlook on life.<br /><br />Even if you don't buy into the divine and supernatural aspect of the teachings included in The Secret you can improve aspects of your life by looking at the glass as half full rather than half empty.<br /><br />Even if that's all you take away from The Secret then it's still a winner.
B001FEA9QU|4.0|This is the best Metallica album since the Black album.  Metallica under Rick Rubin have returned to their roots. The album is much better than St. Anger and Ulrich's downtuned drums are gone, thank G-d.  Especially good are the songs, \\"That was just your life\\" and \\"All Nightmare Long\\"    which contain all out thrash which you can bang your head to.  \\"The Day that Never Ends\\" is also good and reminiscent of \\"One\\".  Cyanide and Unforgiven III are the next best. The other songs are forgettable.
B00005JPO1|1.0|After Lucas gave us the abomination that was the Star Wars prequels, my expectations were pretty low for a new Indiana Jones adventure.    Crystal Skull didn't even meet my lowest expectations. Compared to the rest of the series, this is the odd man out. Just didn't feel right from the very beginning (CGI prairie dogs anyone) I wished Marion had more to do than to look love sick the whole time. And the ending...well lets just say I thought I saw the new X-files movie.    It's sad when a great franchise such as this which inspired obvious knockoffs (The Mummy, National Treasure) in turn copies the movies it inspired in the first place!
0452289963|5.0|This is the most spiritually enlightening book I have ever read. I now \\"get\\" what it means to be enlightened and live in the moment in either acceptance, enjoyment or enthusiasm. I liked it so much I bought it for some family members and friends.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|I have read just about everything the character or Dracula has ever appeared in from the Bram Stoker's novel to the Marvel Comics adaptation and beyond.  Likewise I have seen many Dracula movies from Nosfaratu to Bella Lagosi to the Hammer House films.  My favorite adaptation of all the movies is this one.<br /><br />While it could never live up to the classic Lagosi movie it is it's contemporary equal.  Everyone has their take on the legendary blood sucker but this one is at the top.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Dracula (Gary Oldman) comes up behind Harker while he is shaving causing Harker to cut himself.  Dracula then turns his back to him and while facing the camera, licks the blade and quivers his lip.  Truly one of the creepiest moments in filmdom!
B000ZN802W|4.0|Just finished watching this film for the 2nd time.  Cried like a baby both times.  Between the direction, and Hirsch's, Keener's, Vaughn's (whom I usually can't stand) and (in my opinion) most notably Holbrook's performances, this has become one of my favorite films of the year.  I know Holbrook's part was small, but he was amazing, and I really feel that he should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Anyway, the scene with him and Hirsch in Ron's jeep is heartbreaking.  When he asks Alex to let him adopt him, then realizing that he will never see Alex again, very sad.  Kudos to Penn for his direction and screenplay.
B000009ED0|5.0|this cd shows how good kid rock is. he is a white rapper who doesnt think he's black. he's the real deal. he walks around with his long oily hair looking like himself and is an excellent old school rapper.  \\"punk rock mixed with hip hop\\"
B00003CXD5|5.0|Serpentine story of how three gold-diggers are perverted by their success. Well-acted and strikingly directed. Has interesting parallels to Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch\\" in its contrasting portrayal of Mexicans.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an intermediate to advanced workout. My advise is if you are just starting to get in shape, get another dvd , then work your way up to this one. This workout consist of three 20 minutes workouts, divided into Level 1,2,3.each level gets progressively challanging. It took me 3 weeks of working out three times a week to finally do the level 1,2, 3, trio at once. A fantastic workout!!!!!!!
1400079179|2.0|I heard all the hype, I saw all the criticism novels and I have to confess that I was intrigued. Then I was given this book as a gift and sat down to read it in one sitting and thought it was one of the best books ever. The suspense, the puzzles and the pace of it all. Two weeks later, I sat down and re-read it all and wondered what I saw in it at all. Interestingly, Tom Hanks said more or less the same thing in an interview.<br /><br />I needn't outline the story, even on my first reading I found it a little far-fetched the theories surrounding Mary Magdelene. It may have been plausible, but I wasn't completely convinced. Then I found out that the whole thing about the Priory of Sion was a fabrication and that decided me. NONE of what is in this book is true, it's just a not-very-enjoyable pot-boiler that's going to be forgotten before too long and it already has, quite a number of books about the Da Vinci Code are now sitting on bargain tables.<br /><br />This book may have been slightly better if Dan Brown was anything but a hack writer, but that's what he is. The Da Vinci Code is more than a blockbuster novel, it's a MOVIE disguised as a book! Brown should be a screenwriter and leave books to the more worthy, especially ones about dodgy conspiracy theories.<br /><br />Read the book if you must but the movie is much better, Ron Howard's adaptation is much, much better anything that Brown could cook up.
037582913X|5.0|So it turns out that the \\"monster\\" is actually the protagonist which, while having shades of postmodern antihero angst that wil reverberate strongly with fans of, say, Kafka or Burroughs, really threw me for a loop as a kid.     My two year old, on the other hand, has no problem with this conceit, and wants me to read it to him regularly.     He'll understand how cruel this all is when he get a bit older.     Oh yes.     In the meantime, I'll read it for him over and over and over and over, and never get tired of it.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Great musicianship, this is the Metallica that I have come to miss since the Black Album.
B00005JPS8|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. doesn't strike the average viewer as superhero material, which is probably why IRON MAN works so magnificently. Based on the Marvel Comics series about industrialist Tony Stark who builds a metallic suit chock full of high-tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.<br /><br />Downey is near perfect playing the multibillionaire Stark. One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond. The next minute he rivals Al Pacino's Tony Montana of [[ASIN:B0000AMRJC Scarface]] for crassness. He is a workaholic, a hedonist, and an eccentric loner, whose only close relationship is with his secretary, Pepper Potts, played here by Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer. To date, this reviewer has seen that quality of elegance onscreen only in actress Natalie Portman and in Ms. Paltrow's own mother, Blythe Danner. Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.<br /><br />In this version, Stark is wounded by terrorists. Escaping, he takes on the Iron Man persona and returns to wreak vengeance. Unfortunately, the terrorists are being aided by a business rival of Stark Industries, who builds a similar suit and engages Iron Man in a battle for New York City.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie. Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I Love it. Started watching Season 2 by accident then I realized had to watch 1 first. Amazing show.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Year Zero was actually the 1st Nine Inch Nails cd I had ever listened too!  I was highly impressed with the music!  I did know that NIN's previous and older work was much heavier and intense than the newer material!  So,  I went backwards an album and bought [With_Teeth] and played it from cover to cover and was amazed!    There are some heavy tunes!!!!  But,  If you are a fan of Industrial rock like I am, You will like this album!    Songs that I liked primarily:  \\"Hand that feeds\\"  \\"With Teeth\\"  \\"Only\\"  \\"Getting Smaller\\"  \\"Sunspots\\"  \\"Right Where it belongs\\"
B0012Q732O|2.0|Truly a mishmash of misinformation and adventure, but I knew that before ordering. It's a gift for a  little boy. But the business end of the transaction was excellent.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I like their old stuff much better!  Such as Parachutes, A Rush Of Blood To The Head, and X&Y!  The new stuff does not compare to what they had!  I personally think they should go back to their older style!  I enjoy the listening to the older stuff!  They had a special style that No other Band or artist had!  Now,  Coldplay has basically become what all the other bands/artists sound like!      In this album Coldplay has decided to try out newer styles of music and and it does not work out correctly!    Do not buy this album!  Continue to buy the old stuff, thats if Coldplay goes back to the old style!
B000W91RUG|5.0|My son and I love this show. I can see myself all too often in the characters. I think he may as well.    Enjoy! You don't need to pass an IQ test to get a big bang out of this show.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|This is a great album for getting a taste of the Boss from all eras of his career except the most recent of course seeing as this cd was done in the early 90's.<br />It missed a few old favorites, like Growing Up, Seaside Bar Song but it was a good mix, wish it had Something in the Night, and Tougher Than The Rest. The third cd has some not so often heard music on it.<br />It is a great addition to your Bruce Springsteen Library
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE may be somewhat historically incorrect, but it is still a fascinating, extremely entertaining epic motion picture.<br /><br />Why many of the nation's critics, aside from Cate Blanchett's superb performance, didn't like it, I have no idea.  Either they have no idea what they're talking about, or I have absolutely no taste whatsoever.  Indeed, there's no other possible explanation.<br /><br />Blanchett, who may very well be the finest actress working in films today, and Geoffrey Rush reprise the roles they first played in ELIZABETH (1998).  This time out they're joined by Clive Owen, cast as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Stuart.<br /><br />As in the earlier film, also directed by Shekhar Kapur, this picture is filled with of court intrigues, plus a plot by the Spanish Government and Mary Stuart to assassinate the Queen, all of which culminates with a huge sea battle and the defeat of the Spanish Armada.<br /><br />On a more personal level, the movie deals with Elizabeth's romantic feelings toward Raleigh and her anger when she learns that he loves another.<br /><br />Rhys Ifans, Jordi Molla and Abbie Cornish co-star in this excellent historical thriller.<br /><br />© Michael B.

0446693804|5.0|This is one of the only times I would say a movie is better than the book.  But if you haven't seen the movie yet this is a great book.  I like to read the book after seeing the moving to read what the characters were thinking etc.<br />I enjoyed the differences of the book from the movie but I liked the ending in the movie better.<br />It's a great rainy day afternoon read.
0452284937|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. When I started it I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but I was immediately swept into the story and the relationship between Griet and Vermeer.<br /><br />I think I'll rent out the movie now :)
B000050XEI|4.0|The title that I did for the review at first glance seems like an incredibly positive remark about the music you're going to hear should you listen to this. Ethereal vocals, gentle pianos and synthesizers all come together to create an audio soundtrack for anything peaceful you can think of. On the other hand, for the detractors, it becomes a telling phrase, especially the \\"another\\" part since Enya's music fundamentally hasn't changed since her first big success, 1988's \\"Watermark\\" album. However, nobody seems to do this style of music the best like Enya and thanks to its timely and amazing single, the album became quite a hit.    A Day Without Rain: Like previous albums (though strangely, not \\"Amarantine\\") the album opens with a title track instrumental which features a beautiful piano melody and later accompanied what sounds like a low choir humming. It's gorgeous and good way to open. 8.5/10    Wild Child: She's always had that one track that seems quite energetic and almost bouncy and it's pretty much a guarantee you'll be singing this one quickly. Chorus at the end goes on slightly too long but it's so catchy that you forgive it. 9/10    Only Time: Released around the time of 9/11, the hopeful message and the soothing nature of the song became an instant listen for those hoping to cope with loss and even on its own, it's still a fantastic song. Enya sounding particularly gorgeous here and I absolutely love the bridge, this is sort of one of those cases where the single did happen to be the best song. 10/10    Tempus Vernum: The requisitive Latin track which is more darker and ominous than anything on the record and though I still consider \\"Pax Deorum\\" my favorite, this one's still pretty good though you might not keep revisiting the track...unless you're in a particularly sinister mood. 7/10    Deora Ar Mo Chroi: Sounds more like a sad church hymn someone would sing at a funeral, this is another beautiful track mainly due to the vocals and the melody it sings,bringing a huge degree of sadness with them. 8/10    Flora's Secret: Another bouncy track with bass providing a bit more low end and violins doing a simple-but-effective melody, this is another likable track and another one of the album's highlights. 8/10    Fallen Embers: Back to the sadness and tranquil stuff, not that it's a bad thing realy though it might be hard to discern one track from another. There's nothing really wrong with the track and Enya does higher vocals than she usually does but having another synth/piano/vocal track might make you remember other similar songs. 7.5/10    Silver Inches: Don't get any funny ideas about the title if you're thinking naughty. It's a brief instrumental clocking in at 1:38 and the main melody is more on the stattaco strings and what sounds like a sitar or at least a bright guitar sound (or whatever she happens to use, she does too much stuff). It's good but a bit too brief to leave any impact. 6/10    Pilgrim: This was always a problem I had since she'll frequently follow a slower track with another one which makes it a bit run-on. The background vocals give it a bit more difference and changes but it's still a slow and more moody music. It's fine but she's done better. 7/10    One by One: Dare you not to get that \\"hey-hey-hey\\" hook in your head. Though Enya's vocal delivery might suggest a slow track, her melodies and phrasing make it more strangely upbeat and it becomes instantly likable. Though it doesn't have the \\"Wild Child\\" energy, it's still good. 8.5/10    The First of Autumn: More brass-y with a lot more low end instruments and Enya doing background vocals (as always), it's an alright instrumental and is more a good look into Enya's arrangement skills and using different instruments than being relaxing like the title track. 7/10    Lazy Days: At least she closes it off with an upbeat track which will most likely get you singing along to it's \\"daa-daa\\" hook. Doesn't upstage \\"Wild Child\\" or even an old goodie like\\"Book of Days\\" but it's still well worth revisiting. 8/10    Enya has an album artist always had a slight degree of inconsistency since songs on their own were great and beautiful and can evoke so much imagery but songs flowing one to next felt different as song similarities were a bit too pronounced or she'd be like the \\"Memory of Trees\\" album and have 3 slow ones in a row. This may have been the most popular but I wouldn't call it her best per se, just another great collection of music.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I have seen the movie 6 times.  I think that says a lot for the music.  I especially love the CD because the cast members sing their own songs.  I bought 2 CDs and gave one to a friend who has seen the movie numerous times.  When I was in Border's book store here in Hawaii, I was told by the manager that as soon as people had seen the movie, they came into the store to buy the CD.  The music is wonderful and the CD plays in my work/craft room every day.  Thank you so much.
0345457692|5.0|A debut novel, Altered Carbon is an impressive piece of work. Richard K. Morgan has crafted a fully realized universe and within that rich backdrop, he plunked former Envoy Takeshi Kovacs in the middle of it. With a plot that's akin to a Chinatown-esque conspiracy and set in a Blade Runner-esque universe but still retain its originality and inventiveness, it's both heady and convoluted yet satisfying. Morgan immerses the reader with details, so you can fully grasp the unusual concepts he presents like resleeving, Methuselahs and theme hotels with personality. Such concepts offer philosophical musings despite the comic book/graphic novel-like action tableau, pacing, violence and descriptions (oh how he describe the sex scenes) which makes the book satisfying and profound. In the hands of a lesser talent, this would be a disposable book likely to be forgotten and perhaps regretted buying. But with Morgan's sure-handedness or confidence, this is a work worthy of to be compared to Philip K. Dick's works.     Still, Altered Carbon is not for everybody. Don't buy it if you're expecting a quick read during your commute. Altered Carbon demands your attention with all its intricate details and meticulous world-building. If you do go for those, you will be rewarded and will be looking forward to reading Takeshi Kovacs next adventures.
0743496736|5.0|This was the first book i've read by jodi Picoult and i loved it! The setting is in New Hampshire, where i have traveled to. I was familiar with the atmosphere so i could easily place the imagery in my head.    At first i was a little worried that i wouldn't be able to understand all of the law terms, but i was carefully explained. I, too, liked the idea of using flashbacks, it helped me understand the character but showing how they might have reacted in certain situations. Also, if you were insightful,  you can pick out little details and analyze them to help fit into the \\"present\\".    Each character was well thought-out, and very intracate with a detailed backround, so it wasn't necessarily easy to figure out their role in the murder.    I like how Josie was kind of a recluse all through the trail, and she has to sort through her own issues. You probably won't understand them until you reach the end, but it definitely shows how people reacted the way they did or how they recovered to certain injuries...    Peter, on the other hand, frustrated me throughout the whole book. I just want to know WHY?, he never directly states it, though. His past experiences make him who he is and why he caused this epidemic and broke many people in more ways than just one.    Before i finished the book, i found out that Jodi P. likes to add an unexpected endings, so when i was near the end i started plotting crazy ideas and scenerios that would eventually pan out. I think i had two major ideas in my mind and one of them i instantly was able to cross out. The other, well, i can say it somewhat came to fruition, but, you'll have to read this book to figure it out!    Happy Reading :-D    -K.B.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This movie is simply amazing.  Based off of the not so well known cult hit \\"Firefly\\", this movie continues the story that that prematurely canceled series was never able to.  To those of us who loved the series this movie is a treasure.  Joss is a masterful storyteller who has created such depth and realism for all of the beloved characters that it really pulls you in, and the special features and commentaries give it excellent replay value.  I would suggest this movie to anyone looking for a solid, fun movie.
B000001EHS|5.0|This is another Greatest Hits package I have picked up to fill in for missing/lost CDs.    It has all the hits that I remember from the Pyromania and Hysteria  when Def Leppard was their most popular.  I know they had a couple of records before then, but I never really listened to the band until I saw Photograph on MTV.    Bringin On The Heartbreak is a real good song from an album before they became famous with Photograph.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|[[ASIN:B0009S2T0M Oldboy]] is a movie that defies classification.  This movie could easily be sliced and diced into three or four genres and be in the upper echelon of any of them.  In fact, even writing a review of this movie is a challenge.  Basic plot synopses will not give you a sense of how original and well made this movie is.  This is the rare gem; you can either watch it simply for enjoyment, or peel back the layers like an onion and study each one.<br /><br />There are a few warnings however.  This film is not for the squeamish.  After lulling you in with some slow segments, the movie can turn very violent and gruesome in an instant.  The film also touches upon some controversial topics, so it is not for the judgmental or the easily offended.  An important aspect to remember when watching this movie is that many of the social norms of Korean culture, and Asian culture in general, are so different from our own that it may be hard for some people to understand why characters make the choices they do.  If you are open-minded and study the film carefully, there is a lot of depth and meaning in that too.<br /><br />The movie really occurs in several unique sections that are tied together at the end.  The basic formula has been described as a \\"revenge thriller\\" but the story changes in such a way to make that category inadequate.<br /><br />Dae-Su (Min-Sik Choi) is an unfortunate man who gets drunk and kidnapped.  He is held captive in a cheap motel room for a very long time, with no real understanding of who is holding him or why.  All attempts to escape or find out why he is there result in nothing.<br /><br />The story then takes a turn as Dae su is released under mysterious circumstances.  He vows revenge against his captors.<br /><br />Dae Su seems to have a loose grip on reality after years of captivity and we see him slip further into madness as he seeks his tormentors.  As we follow his search for his captors and his difficult integration back into society, small clues start to emerge about Dae Su's past and who might have been behind his imprisonment.  There is more than just one twist to the story, and each plot element adds a new layer.<br /><br />He befriends a woman in a sushi bar and they develop a quick relationship.  As all the plot elements collide, we see that nobody in the story is exactly who we think they are.<br /><br />The end results in a very thought-provoking dilemma which questions the fundamental nature of many of life's basic human relationships.  Love, hate, revenge; they are all put under the microscope in this movie.<br /><br />The film is shot beautifully and has many beautiful scenes.  Colors and shadows are used to create and foreshadow emotion.<br /><br />The DVD extras include standard fare, such as interviews, deleted scenes, trailers and a commentary track.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This movie is a must-see if you enjoy psychological horror, as long as you can set aside your squeamishness.  If you like psychological drama, horror, or thrillers this may be the best movie you've seen recently in any of those categories.  Watch it with an open mind and avoid plot spoilers.  Once you've seen it, you'll probably want to see it again.<br /><br />Enjoy.ut Dae Su's past and who might have been behind his imprisonment.

0757302661|3.0|I found this book pretty late into my pregnancy (around 7 months). Don't get me wrong, the book has alot of great information and even some exercises you can try yourself. But my opinion is that to really benefit from hypnobirthing, you would need to take the actual classes to have an instructor teaching you and walking you through it. Many of the exercises described in the book were vague and I wouldn't have been sure if I was doing them correctly.    I loved the general information the book has to offer about how our body reacts to fear, how to do pereneal massage, how to know when you may be close to beginning labor, etc...etc... All of that was great information and I'm glad I got the book. But unfortunately, I do not think I will use hypnobirthing during my labor this time around. I may consider taking the classes for my next child.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is a great CD by a rockin' band. Viva La Vida is the song of the decade. You can't go wrong buying this CD. And not just for the youth: I'm just past 50 years young and play this all the time. Great addition to any collection.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Estuve escuchando cerca de 3 hrs mi colecci&oacute;n de Megadeth, cuando de repente recorde que Metallica saco nuevo disco y se me ocurrio escuchar la lista de canciones en Amazon.com, cuando comenzo la primera canci&oacute;n y escuche la voz de James Hetfield practicamente no pude diferenciarlo de Dave Mustaine y lo mismo con el ritmo de las canciones!... y de ahi segui con el resto del disco y la verdad que seguia con el mismo dilema. Pero bueno, hay que darle una oportunidad a estos chicos que desde Load-Reload-Anger no han dado una y hay algunos que piensan que estan asi desde el Black Disk. Eso si, primero lo escuchare por otro medio porque no pienso comprarlo ya me decepcionaron 3 veces seguidas.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I could not wait to get this DVD and when I finally did get it, I was really amazed that Jerry could sing so well.  Some may think he didn't do such a good job but I am a fan of everything he does.  It was a great love story with so much hurt and loneliness.  I felt such pain for the Phantom.  Jerry did such a wonderful job behind the mask he had to wear because his part required his character to show emotion thru his eyes and his voice thru his songs . It was wonderful.  I suggest this DVD to all and especially to those hard-core Jerry Butler fans.  They have probably already seen it since we keep close vision to all his work.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Having the benefit of 4 songs being released as singles before I purchased the album, I knew this was a good purchase.  As with Late Registration, a couple of songs on the album that have failed to grow on me but enough out of the others to recommend
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Such wonderful restraint throughout the movie.  Rarely does a story unfurl the way this one does developing the characters making us love and hate and love them again.  I can't remember the last time I saw such a beautiful film!
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|I'm not quite sure why I keep buying Coldplay albums.  I really want to like them, I guess. Each Album releases a number of singles and they are always great but sadly I find the album does not add up to the promise created by the quality of the singles released from it. This really is one for the diehard fans - I think I will wait for the greatest hits
B000UAE7RW|5.0|Chinatown is a potent reminder that films are more than just the hormone fueled adventures of Dick and Jane. The film takes on a large social issue and shows one mans struggle against the machine in Los Angeles of the 50's. Powerful performances by Nicholson (not a fave) and Dunaway frame a beautifully directed drama demonstrataing the power of film. If you have never seen this film, I highly recommend that you do so. If you haven't seen this for years, reaquaint yourself with a masterpiece.
B0015519VS|4.0|Yet again Usher produces a fine mix of dance and slower songs.  If you like Usher, you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't bought an Usher album before, I don't think I would start with this one but once hooked - buy it
B0002XEDQM|3.0|We all love the music and the man. I feel there was a bit to much \\"pop\\" influence though. To modern a twist on such greats. As far as the sound? This is a diffrent story indeed. If you have an afinity for the \\"high-end\\", \\"You will aprreciate it here. With ultra highend audio, any glich in the studio will be noticed, especially with vinal. This disc has many BUT, not one will deture from the performence itself. They are akin to the scraches in fine lether. I highly recomend this piece for many reasons. If nothing els, \\"GOD BLESS SACD AND RAY CHARLES!!!!\\" Please keep buying them and keep this flame alive!!!!!! \\"Just listen\\"
B001EKSW82|5.0|Amon Amarth fans will absolutely want this one - it launches right into the title track with full power and doesn't let up. AA has cranked up the power and speed, given us more of the chords and ripping rhythm lines we love, but also managed to inject new musical elements (including solos!) while preserving their trademark roaring stories of battle and ultra-heavy guitar sound.    The only miss for me is \\"Where is your God\\" but the rest is excellent - well worth the wait.
B00026ZG10|5.0|This movie has everything: Undercover agents, military violence, insane anti-American antagonist, great comic situations, Jamie Lee Curtis doing a sexy dance, family rescue...  best of all, Arnold.  Who else can deliver true grit fighting and side-splitting humor the way Arnold can?  This movie has them both in adequate amounts to keep you riveted.  Who dances the Tango better, Jamie Lee or Tia Carrera?  This movie is just great fun!!
B000062XFG|5.0|My Title says it all, this collection comes in a well designed box which my only complaint about it is that it may be a little difficult to get the disc box out of the external box.  The quality of the DVD is fantastic, all the episodes look better than the first time I watched them on their original air dates with crisp sounds. If you have never seen Star Trek: TNG this is going to be a real treat for you.  All of the episodes are memorable in their own way. A good investment!
B00006IRJU|4.0|I am a fan on pop music from 80´s and currently I enjoy to buy CD´s and download representative songs that contains my memories for that lovely decade. Once in a while I heard the song \\"Crazy\\" but without possibility to identify the band that played it. By good luck I saw on TV the video for another song \\"Electric Blue\\" and I went directly to purchase it on Amazon then my surprise that \\"Crazy\\" is included on the same album. It seems that Icehouse is a well known band at Australia but nowhere else. \\"Crazy\\", \\"Electric Blue\\" and \\"Man of Colours\\" are songs that you can have in your playlists. The album is well balanced and the remixes are an appreciated bonus. The only disappointments is that rest of songs follows the same pattern but without the intensity for the ones mentioned.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|When the film started with a CGI gopher I thought it was an advertisement for Ice Age 3. But no, it was Indian Jones with Ice Age Cartoon gophers. And then it went on, obviously painfully half the movie is CGI but without much effort. Cate Blanchett is a wasted talent in this movie and seems to know it, her accent slipping ever so often. Harrison Ford is his same old self, literally, he is OLD and rather out of place. Lucas hasn't lost his touch - that is from Epsiode I and on, this seems to be one more \\"sell more toys\\" movie without any other regard, except of course use CGI at every chance. Spielberg? Was he even there or did he do it all over the phone, or did he do what limited job he had before Lucas came in to do CGI? LaPoof is actually half decent but I am lost why he is there at all. Then the plot is like it is running between highlights of former glories instead of any kind of story. Right up to half the movie I was thinking \\"Well it is on par with Temple of Doom\\" which IMHO isn't half good, but don't worry half way through this movie surprises you by becoming a lot worse. The net outcome is exactly the sum of its parts = 1 Star.
B00000IFWE|5.0|When I first heard a few cuts from this album I know I had to have it, and I was not disappointed!  I have listened to it again and again.  The songs \\"Echo\\", \\"Room at the Top\\" and \\"Swingin\\" I have actually listened to all day.  I am a relative \\"newcomer\\" to the Tom Petty bandwagon and I have found his music to be absolutely incredible.      Thank you Amazon for sending it to me so promptly.  You sure beat out the record stores!

I have read more than 20 fiction books this year and it amazes me this did not make and stay on the top 10 bestsellers list.  City of Thieves is also excellent but not quite as good.  Can't wait for the authors next book.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|The year was 1987 and I bought the album master of puppets, I was 13 years old. All the kids on the block including myself were enthralled with this monumental, soundscape.  It was the sound of revolution. And Metallica were the coolest with their anti-hero /anti establishment, take no prisoners type of abandon. From that moment on we all backtracked and bought Kill em All and ride the lightning and never looked back, they were clearly the antithesis of what we aspired to be like; A very influencing slice of pop culture at the very least.<br /><br />And Justice for all came out in 1989 and I saw them play at the Irvin Meadows Theater in CA. At that point from a 15 year olds perspective, Metallica were at their peak and solidified their legendary status for all time.<br /><br />Around the time the Black album came out I had moved on and my musical tastes began to broaden and morph into something else, it was a very exciting time for underground and indie music in general as well as learning about great music of the past. The Black album didn't do it for me to be honest and ushered in the unanimous debate of the two Metallica's - pre black album and post black album.<br /><br />Now the New Album - Death Magnetic:<br />When listening to this latest release, there is a feeling that Metallica the band has realized there legendary body of work and can reflect on what made them so special and powerful in the past. I can see them saying  - lets just let it all hang out and not try to be something we aren't or try to force things. Let's just have fun and see where it takes us. This time around the overall feelings of the tracks are more relaxed and flow better then they have in a long time. The galloping riffs that we've all missed are back including some slight hints of Kill Em All. The technical breakdowns and math rock like dirges add a nice touch and are more interesting than previous bland albums devoid of solos. Rick Ruben was clearly a winning choice for a producer. His style is almost of a fans perspective where he basically tells you what flies and what doesn't. This is what Metallica needed the most; someone who could be brutally honest. The sound clipping issue and production values is a hot debate that has muffled many listeners. I am not one of these. If you want to hear bad sounding albums listen to the stooge's RAW power which to me has great classic songs but the production is so horrendous it's hard to listen to. A tiny bit of EQ'ing and the clipping on Death Magnetic cleaned up and I can barely notice it. All and all I would say that no, the album isn't classic like Master of Puppets but how could it be? The band members aren't 21 and hungry anymore, and that time has past. What I will say is that they are much closer to their legacy now than they have been since And Justice for All which for my tastes is a good thing. This disc has proved to be a very fun listen that can be recommend for old school fans, who have been clamoring for just a taste of the good ol days.ans perspective where he basically tells you what flies and what doesn't.

B0014VPFTA|1.0|but this CD was horrible.  I only listened to it once all the way through, so maybe it's one of those CDs that you have to get used to.  Either way, I couldn't even imagine spending the time to listen to it again.      With how popular he is, maybe my expectations were too high.  The lyrics are pretty ordinary, and his singing is annoying since it's the same on most every song.  I was also disappointed with the guitar work, as I really appreciate a talented guitarist and was looking forward to discovering another great musician to listen to.  Mayer is definitely overrated in this category.      As I said, I usually don't write negative reviews, but I wanted to warn others who are thinking about Mayer as being anything notable.  Maybe it's this album only, as some other reviewers have suggested.
B000W4HIXQ|5.0|This is a guy movie for guys who like movies. If you ever liked Bruce Willis flicks, or the old Die Hard franchise, then you should like this one as well. It was fun. The character is completely indestructible. He can jump out of a moving car, get a scratch, and keep on going. He can slide down a destroyed bridge's off-ramp, and somehow avoid piercing himself on the twisted rebar below. Suspend your disbelief. You will dig it!
B0008ENICU|5.0|In this case, old is definitely better! I had seen this movie several times on TV, but had missed scenes that had been cut for commercials (i.e., fashion show in color, while the rest of the movie was in b&w). Although the new version of this movie is up-to-date in its views of women, the original was definitely more \\"catty.\\" Also, the new version missed out on the triumphant face-to-face scene between the wife and the other woman at the end of the original. Finally, the scene in the new version, with Meg Ryan's character eating the stick of butter, contained a line that simply ruined the movie. I say that because the message of a woman being able to survive without a man was lost with that one line and no mother (Meg) would want her daughter to think that's what it takes to \\"keep\\" a man...

0930289234|5.0|Let's open by saying that if you're into comics at all, this is the first classic of the graphic novel genre, and you really need to read this book for the insights it gives into what might drive people to put on tights and fight crime, and where that choice might lead them.  At the same time, this book is not for children - besides the (relatively) graphic violence and complex moral issues, there are sexual situations (no nudity, of course) that fall well beyond anything normally seen in comics.  If you're a sci-fi/fantasy fan who's not really about comics, but willing to give it a chance, this review's for you.<br /><br />Set in an alternate America of the 1980's, Moore paints a bleak picture of a world on the brink of nuclear holocaust, where the growing power of evil infects even the costumed vigilantes who have dedicated their lives to fighting it.  The story takes a long hard look at what makes these \\"heroes\\" tick, and shows that the kind of people who take this path are certain to have their own demons - demons that cause them to at least occasionally, act demonically.  The story opens with the brutal murder of a hero who calls himself \\"the Comedian\\".  Brief, fragmented glimpses into his past show him taking down criminals, winning for Uncle Sam in Viet Nam, but also heartlessly shooting the Asian girl who claims she's pregnant with his child.  The Comedian's murder is investigated by a hero called Rorschach, who has himself crossed the line by brutally disposing of the murderer of a six-year-old girl.  Rorschach believes he has uncovered a plot to kill and discredit costumed heroes, but its true purpose remains a mystery.  Ultimately, Moore asks us to decide who the real heroes and villains are, and suggests that perhaps even the best of us may feel the need to kill sometimes, for the greater good.  But do the ends ever really justify the means?<br /><br />Even aside from the content, this book is notable for some unusual techniques seldom seen in comics.  Each of the twelve chapters ends with a page or three of text, supposedly excerpts from various documents that shed further light on the characters and situations described in the body of the story.  Another unusual (although not as effective) technique is the interpolation of a \\"meta-comic\\" - an old-style pirate comic that one young character reads at the newsstand.  Moore uses this comic as well as flashbacks in another interesting technique - that of showing us one scene while describing another, bleeding back and forth to help inform us of the characters' emotional states.<br /><br />To be sure, the plot has some serious holes, and the ending isn't as satisfying as it might be (although it's certainly unexpected) but the intense dramatic situations and powerfully drawn (yet quite humanly flawed) characters more than make up for it.  No, this isn't Dostoyevsky, but this is not your father's comic book, either.ach of the twelve chapters ends with a page or three of text, supposedly excerpts from various documents that shed further light on the characters and situations described in the body of the story.

He cites examples of the differing styles of some of these writers helping the reader appreciate the subtleties that may have escaped notice in the past.      The book will challenge the writer who approaches novel writing from a process viewpoint and instead shows how storytelling, the Stephen King way, is accomplished and why the level of suspense remains high in his books.      On Writing opens the mind to the possible and shows how it can be done.

0786838655|5.0|I am a senior citizen--a librarian--a woman-- who could not possibly be interested in the story of a 12-year-old boy whose ADHD behavior causes him to be moved from private school to private school or that he has momentary lapses when strange behavior takes over or that he finally learns that he is  a half-blood (no, not a HP half-blood), but the son of a god. No, I could not possibly be interested in such a far-fetched story, but then again I AM interested in this story because--WOW--what a story!!<br /><br />Percy Jackson (Perseus at that!) learns in this first installment of The Olympians that he is indeed the son of a god and not some little podunk god, but one of the big three--Poseidon, god of all the seas. As a half-blood, he is given a quest: to find Zeus's thunderbolt. Someone has stolen it, giving rise to the book's title: the Lightning Thief.<br /><br />If all this seems really strange, then you are normal. After all, we thought Greek mythology was dead. How little we knew, when in reality, it is alive and well and operating in the New West---America. The reader gets so caught up in this new telling of the old myths, ahem, stories of the living gods, that it becomes fresh and vibrant again. In fact, Mt. Olympus is now located on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building and accessible only through a special elevator ticket. You must have an appointment to get there.<br /><br />Percy Jackson's pursuit of the lightning thief is just plain out fun reading. When I had to stop for any period of time, I couldn't wait to get back to the story. If the reader thinks it unrealistic that a 12-year-old is the hero, then put two and two together. Being a hero does not always take brawn--often thinking, intellect, strategy are required to solve a problem. It doesn't hurt that the hero's father is a god who nudges a bit.<br /><br />The most exciting stop in the quest is coming before this horribly evil presence. I guessed its identity long before it was revealed (as any student of mythology will), so I am giving away no secrets here.<br /><br />The most fun episodes occur when Ares, god of war, appears as a big ol' motorcycle punk in a black leather jacket. He must wear sunglasses to shield onlookers from his fiery eyes (literally fiery) and his macho, belligerent behavior. Hey! This is the god of war--how did you think he would act? A new piece of information comes out concerning Ares--Yo, are you paying attention?!!--Anyone in his presence suddenly becomes aggressive and must keep a constant check on his temper to prevent untoward behavior! Reader! Stop looking around--I'm right here on this page trying to tell you about Ares!<br /><br />Does Percy find the thunderbolt? Do you really think I am going to tell you? Whew, that Ares is something else. Glad he is gone for now!<br /><br />Anyway, quests usually end well, but not without cost, as is true here. Certain things must be addressed. Certain decisions must be made. Ah, this is all so vague. Whatever happens in Book 1, Percy Jackson is ready for whatever awaits in Book 2: \\"The Sea of Monsters.\\", so I am giving away no secrets here.

0679735909|4.0|This is a novel with intriguing uniquities which make it resoundingly great, but also perhaps deliver too much deliberate detail so as to remove some of the ingenious luster to this novel.<br /><br />A new novel, this book has many characteristics of the turn-of-the century British greats: Forster, Waugh, James . . . The prose is rich and the topic involves hidden issues of ethics and morals - but unlike those authors there is a hidden mystery within the final pages which unravels and binds the previously explored issues.  We learn more about the protagonist, but learn to question more about why and how the surprise ever erupted.<br /><br />A love story utilizing many of the tricks of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", this book teases the reader to read more.  The book carefully releases hints of the mystery - but the depth of the mystery is that the detective is actually the personification of the mystery.  I care not to spoil this book - but upon reading this book that last sentence will make sense to you.<br /><br />The writing's depth can never be overstated.  The poetry within the cover pages is by Byatt - and some chapters are pages upon pages of the fictional heroine Christabel LaMotte.  The letters between LaMotte and the other poet - whose poetry again is by Byatt - are all written in 19th century formality, and all by Byatt.  The modern day descriptions of the sleuths is by Byatt.  This is truly a cluster of different writing styles expertly processed by one author. Like the Kennedy assassination, it is hard to believe one person could do this by him or her self.<br /><br />At times, the detailed poetry may bore the common reader.  Most of us do not choose or like to read pages upon pages of poems.  I am no exception.  But, appreciation for this skill is not lost with my personal preferences. And, to this author, I applaud taking on the large task of being poet and novelist within one book.<br /><br />Only a few books mesh poetry and prose as well as this novel.  Few can make an excellent work of poem and novel.  Nabokov's \\"[[ASIN:0679410775 Pale Fire (Everyman's Library (Cloth))]]\\" is one that comes to mind.

Every where you compare to the live action, live action is far better.  Ending wasn't as good it didn't focus the main villain.  Anyway is only rental for sure.
B0002ONALU|5.0|Following their remarkable debut EP \\"Come On Pilgrim,\\" Pixies teamed with the great Steve  Albini for their debut LP, \\"Surfer Rosa,\\" which itself became a touchstone of independent, \\"alternative\\" music, cited by Kurt Cobain as one of his favorite albums and a significant influence on Nirvana's music.<br />From the bombastic (and perfectly tuned, mic'ed, and recorded) drum intro of \\"Bone Machine,\\" to the strange beauty of Gigantic, and the punk intensity of \\"Something Against You,\\" to the snaking bass line and lyrical genius of \\"Cactus,\\" this album is as huge in its span as it is in its sound.<br />Never again would the Pixies so much as attempt to match the grit and grime of this album, and that's probably for the best. But for all the nice production values of Bossanova and Trompe Le Monde, they never sounded better, and they surely never had a better album cover.
B00003CXV4|5.0|Movie is very entertaining and touching. Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are very good in their roles.
B0000570DO|5.0|Often overlooked, this essential collection of early, live Beatles studio recordings is a treasure trove. The definitive version of \\"She's a Woman\\" is worth the price by itself, add to that dozens of original songs recorded in one take without overdubs, and dozens more covers that don't appear anywhere else, and this is definitely a good album to turn to when you need that innocent, British invasion magic as only the Beatles could bring it. Buy this on vinyl and do yourself a favor, this music was meant to be enjoyed on analog equipment.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Quo Vadis is the love story of the arrogant Roman general Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor) who falls in love with a Christian girl, Lygia (Deborah Kerr) against the backdrop of Nero's tyrannical reign in Rome. The movie, based on Henryk Sienkwicz (sp?)'s novel of the same name, does detract a bit from the book. There are fewer characters, a less convoluted plot, and less depth to some of the characters, but that's more or less expected - as it is, this is a long film.     I am a die-hard Robert Taylor fanatic, so obviously seeing him in this is a bonus. His obviously American accent's a little jarring when compared with the rest of the cast, but he looks wonderful and his depiction of Marcus - initially proud, arrogant, and almost brutal in his sense of patrician superiority, later transitioning into the loving, sensitive but yet not milquetoasty husband of Lygia - is understated but good.     Deborah Kerr is a little irritatingly sweet and ever-patient; but the most brilliant performance is that of Peter Ustinov as the insane Nero - he actually made by flesh creep!    Slightly dated special effects (the chariot run to Rome; Ursus's bullfight; Rome burning), but not bad enough to severely affect viewing. Highly recommended.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|Speed racer was one of my favorite cartoons growing up. Having heard the generally negative to very negative reviews for the movie I passed on it in the theater. Those reviews suprised me because of the stellar director and cast.<br /><br />Having just seen the movie on DVD I can honestly say I enjoyed it and appreciated the casting and nods to the original series. Emile did a fine job in the lead, Spridle was well done, John Goodman, Christinna, etc. The original series was always melodramtic and over the top with Speed saves the day or even the world but the film-makers took that and used it about as well as could be done.<br /><br />The dialogue does make you cringe at times but overall it is a very enjoyable ride and fans of the original series will not be disappointed at all. We even get the Chim-Chim Spridle double-team in trench coat. As for the DVD itself; few extras, just a couple of entertaining shorts, and no commentary. Bottom-line as a fan of the series I am very glad I saw it. Much better than critics would leave you to believe. If you never saw the original series, still enjoyable. Great cast, some neat visuals, and likeable characters.
B00005JPO1|5.0|First of all I did enjoy the first three Indiana Jones flicks. Raiders had great action scenes and special effects that are still hard to top today. Temple of Doom heavied up on the action and some scenes scared the crap out of me when I was a kid, especially the guy getting lowered into the lava. Last Crusade was probably the best of the bunch PERIOD. Now we have Crystal Skull. First of all, I'm glad that Harrison Ford came back and so did Steven Spielberg as director. Oh, can't forget Karen Allen as Indy's love, Marion. Shia LaBeouf just did not carry the film at all with his performance. I went to see the movie just to see Indy in more action and the science fiction story with the aliens did play a descent part in the movie. My stepfather plans to buy the film on Blu-Ray, but I want the DVD release. Is the movie worth watching? Yes, if you are a fan of the three previous films, which I loved. I did enjoy this movie, but it was nowhere close as good as the original three. I still give the movie 5 stars because I left the movie theater impressed as I'm sure anyone else did when they saw this film and the original three. I say it's worth it and if they do another Indiana Jones film, bring back Harrison Ford if they can. As for the movie, SEE IT!
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Okay, so I had no intention of ever seeing this one because of the gruesome theme.  I've never even been interesting in seeing it in the theatre but thought I'd give this movie a chance.  Hey for a dollar rental from the library, how could I lose right?       I had been VERY apprehensive about watching the DVD and actually thought I'd just returned it without ever viewing it.  Well I was quite surprised that I found the movie wickedly (although a bit gory)interesting!      Although Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are not singers I thought their singing was fine for the characters they portrayed.  I wouldn't choose them for the \\"Phantom\\" or \\"Christine\\" but they did just fine in this movie.
B0000DKMK0|5.0|KB1 and 2 are PERFECT. But this review is for Kill Bill 1.<br /><br />Plot: The Bride is a woman who is getting married. On her wedding day, she gets a bullet put in her head by a partner in her assassin squad named Bill. She goes into a 4 year coma and when she wakes up, she is not ready to make nice. She has a hit list, which consists of the DVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination squad). She goes to Japan, gets Hattori Hanzo sword, and is ready to begin the slicing and dicing.<br /><br />This is an AWESOME movie. Great Cast (Sonny Chiba? AWESOME!!!!), and great music. Uma Thurman is brilliant in her role as The Bride. She can play The Bride like nobody else can. I was also surprised to see Chiaki Kuriyama as GoGo, the schoolgirl-dressed Crazy 88 who is also strong in her performance.<br /><br />And not to mention the blood and gore. Over the top, yet in a good way. Whenever a limb gets amputated, blood sprays out in an over the top fashion. Love it! And this is a great film overall, so see it!<br /><br />And aside from that, this is the UNCUT edition, including the full-on color version of the Crazy 88 scene and more blood and gore, so be sure to seek this out!!
B000R8YC18|5.0|Being a cab driver for almost 18 years, Taxi Driver is a personal favorite of mine. Driving a cab is like a drug: you get to meet new people everyday; you don't have to wait a week or two to get paid---everything's cash money; you get to know the whole city; you learn where the hot spots are--the restaurants, the bars, the clubs, etc. You set your own hours and you choose where you want to work and whom you want to serve. You have no one breathing down your neck--you are your own boss. There's a saying among cabbies: only two kinds of people get more p**** than cabbies: movie stars and rock stars.<br /><br />Being a cab driver is like being a sponge. You become a therapist, a conscience, a drinking buddy, a strip club buddy, a shoulder to cry on, or a one-night stand. People show themselves to you, but you're a cabbie and you've seen it all anyway. For an extra-nice tip, a cab can be a rolling motel, a getaway car, or a safe haven to indulge strange pleasures. A cabbie is faceless from the back seat: he or she won't judge you.<br /><br />After a while, every cabbie develops a callus: every passenger becomes a blur. Robert De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, sees society as converging dots flowing together like the scum on his windshield. Prostitutes, pimps, addicts, and winos gum the sidewalks. Urine stings every breath. Neon melts over his cab. This is the world that Travis lives in, and he hates it more and more everyday.<br /><br />The world has become a toilet to Travis Bickle. Out of this filth appears a flower of virtue that nothing can touch--a young gorgeous campaign-volunteer named Betsy played by Cybill Shepherd. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Driving a cab at night, all Travis sees are whores; however, Betsy's incorruptible, and she alone can redeem mankind. She allows him to take her on a date. Though awkward, he says all the right things. He takes her to the theater to see a movie--a porno flick. Horrified and offended, she hails a cab and leaves him on the sidewalk. Travis is stunned. At that moment, a whore saunters by. They pause to gaze at each other--she is his mirror; they are one and the same.<br /><br />Betsy destroys Travis; she's just like all the others. Now, there's nothing in the world worth saving--now, he knows what he must do. He hones his body and his mind: no more smoking; no more drinking; no more bad food--he must be fit. He'll annihilate Betsy and the whole world. By chance, he stumbles into the middle of a pimp/whore squabble; the whore is a thirteen-year-old girl. Something rises up in Travis's heart, something he never felt before. He discovers something worth saving-- a lost thirteen-year-old whore named Iris (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />Taxi Driver was the second collaboration between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. Bernard Herman's magical score wafts over every scene. Taxi Driver was an omen, forecasting the senseless tragedies of both Columbine and Virginia Tech. No movie collection is adequate without this great film. See it. Buy it. Enjoy it.<br /><br />author of [[ASIN:0759609942 Gotta Be Down!]]sidewalk. Travis is stunned.

1596434252|4.0|This is a really cool Alphabet pop-up book!  The cover is one of those optical plates (sort of holographic), where what you see changes depending on what your angle of approach is.<br /><br />Kids of all ages love this type of stuff, but to test it out I not only gave \\"ABC3D\\"  to my own two children -- currently 6 and 8 years old -- but I loaned it to my son's kindergarten teacher from last year.  The response was overwhelmingly positive.  (The teacher wanted to know where she could get her own copy, and my kids kept clamoring to get the book back, so they could play with it some more.)<br /><br />One of the reasons for the book's popularity is that the pop-ups are clever. While generally speaking each letter sits between it's own two pages, there are some clever variations that keep kids guessing. \\"C\\" becomes \\"D\\" , for example, when the C flops over and a previously hidden vertical bar becomes the upright part of the \\"D\\". Similarly, pulling the page taunt, turns E into an F. And O and P have a special transparency page with two slanty-bars that remake them into Q and R. But if you have time, look at the video and see for yourself.<br /><br />As with all pop-up books, I would suggest that \\"ABC3D\\" be used with parental help.  Toddlers and Preschoolers and even Kindergartners can be really rough on paper.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Duffy does have a great voice, and the production is like the best of Dusty Springfield's albums.  But I wish she'd had a little more help with the songwriting.  Some of the ideas are great, but just don't satisfy lyrically.  And she does make up for a lot with her gutsy approach, and supercool vibe.
0385340540|1.0|The product was never received.  After writing to the seller and receiving a response, it was my understanding that there were circumstances that prevented this transaction from being completed.  This being said is why I rated the product at the lowest level.
B000IOM1YQ|5.0|Stereotomy is a great album. Title track is one of the Project's best moments period and the rest flows nicely along. Whole album has a much different feel than any of the other albums, which makes it stand out nicely after all these years. Bonus track \\"Rumour Goin' Round\\" is a nice rocking instrumental. Remaster sounds crisp and powerful. Highly recommended for fans that don't want all APP songs to sound like \\"The Same Old Sun\\" or other Woolfson-sung soft rock ballads.
B00005JN0T|3.0|He plays the only guy in the movie with any common sense, and is thus very unrealistic. Also, his urban black hip dude schtick grows very wearisome. The special effects are just ok. The plot involves some nonsense about robots taking over the world. It's only set 25 years in the future. A bit of a stretch if this is what the world is really coming to.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is THE BEST WORKOUT I have ever done. It's already a month or more since my first experience with Jillian Michael's 30-Day Shred DVD and I have not yet dared go to Level III. Why? Because Levels I and II are such intense and body-changing workouts... I just haven't even begun to grow bored, and have a whole new level on the DVD to explore yet! I usually get tired of a workout routine quickly but not this time; 1) because they are so challenging, 2) my body has changed in fundamental ways, growing stronger, delivering tons of new energy and focus, and new muscle I never acquired from other workouts, 3) Jillian's training style has helped me in every aspect of my life/career/relationships/self. I quickly got addicted to her training style, love that she pushes you through where you tend to let yourself down and fade out, and got her two major books and even started her customized vitamin regime. Feel like I have rolled back the clock about two decades and am a 13-year-old tomboy kicking around and standing my ground. If anything, Jillian doesn't TALK about believing in yourself, she actually challenges you to DO IT. I give this 10+++. She's genius.
B0008ENICU|5.0|The Women is a classic tale of love and betrayal and the in's and outs of love no matter the decade. Yes overly campy at times,it still is a great movie. Dont bother seeing the remake its absolutely terrible. But this is a classic with Joan Crawford as Crystal Allen,the seductress and man stealer! You cant go wrong with this movie.This is a must have in any series movie buff's collection.

B0000C9ZBW|2.0|This is a very attractive watch, I've looked for a long time to find it at a good price.  But when I got it, the clasp didn't work-it immediately fell open.  In reading the fine print in the instructions for the watch, it states that the seals have to be replaced every two years under normal usage.  I've never seen another watch in my life with this limitation.  It would be interesting to hear from people who have owned the watch for 2-4 years.  I sent it back, but it is too bad because I love the way it looks.

Tiffany soon finds out that Chucky had no means to marry Tiffany, because she found an engagement ring the night Charles Lee Ray died and passed his soul into the Good Guy doll. When Chucky is locked in a playpen, he breaks out and kills Tiffany and transports her body into a doll too. They find out they need to travel to New Jersey to find the amulet Chucky was wearing the night he died. They hitch a ride with Jesse and Jade, a couple who want to be together, but Jade's uncle forbids it. They run away together and get married. During their honeymoon, Chucky and Tiffany kill anyone who gets in their way of the amulet. If you love Chucky, and romantic comedies, you'll love BRIDE OF CHUCKY!!!

B0014XCMVM|5.0|I think most of the people concerned about Alanis Morissette's music is the deviation from album to album. You definitely won't get the harmonica solos from her CDs after year 2000. On this album Flavors Of Entanglement, Alanis and her manager experimented a variety of sounds. From the gothic rock riffs to piano Ballard, from RnBish to radiohead's experimental.     I appreciate this album a lot. The opening track 'citizen of the planet' is my favorite track. I got the same feeling when I first listened to 'Baba' from her 2nd album. Very loud guitar riffs. But this time it's even louder and meaner. I was jumping on my chair, way too excited :D    Second promotion track is 'In praise of the vulnarable man'. A well laid out song with a message. Lovable chorus, the bridge is a killer. You cannot miss this.     This album has more elements from 'Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie' than any others. I think the majority of the songs are up to her standard. It's not something she wrote randomly. I was little disappointed on her last two albums 'Under Rug Swept' and 'So-called Chaos'. Both CDs got some really boring songs. Now I'm back listening to her music again. It sounds nice and fresh.     Her new band members are not bad. A funkier drummer is replaced. See them play live. You'll be surprised by how the songs sound on s stage.
B000002ADT|5.0|Some Kind of Blue is the ultimate example of jazz as defining mood. The music is utterly sublime and the album historical with performances by Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Jimmy Cobb, John Coltrane, Paul Chambers, Wynton Kelly and, of course, Miles Davis. These names resonate with jazz aficionados, which along with its accessibility, is precisely the reason why this album is a perfect introduction to anyone interested in jazz and essential to one's collection.
B001BPJJ82|3.0|The Fall is visually rich film!  The movie follows the story of two patients in a California hospital early in the 20th century.  Alexandria, a 5 year old girl, is in the hospital after falling and breaking her arm working in the nearby oranges groves.  Roy, a suicidal stuntman, is paralyzed after falling off a train during a very dangerous stunt.  Alexandria stumbles into Roys hospital room, only to be quickly charmed by Roy's epic story of bandits, palaces, and revenge.  As Roy's epic unfolds, the audience is quickly drawn into the his visually rich world and Alexandria imagination. But is this just a story or a reflection of both Roys and Alexandia tragic past?    The Fall is a visual stunner! Definitely one for your Blu-Ray library.  Everything from the cool orange dessert sand to the lush green pastures are brilliantly composed and displayed in a rich visual feast that will make your new HD setup a conversation piece.  Each scene in the movie feels like you're watching a moving glossy magazine spread.  With all this visual virtuosity is a criticism on it's story telling.  Not to say the movie is more style over substance, but the fact the movie was filmed over the course of 4 years may attribute to it's muddled story telling.  As a narrative, it doesn't hold together as well or as tightly as you wish it did.  And with how sharply detailed and rich each of the scenes truly are, you are left a little disappointed by how sketchy the story pulls itself together.

Book thief was suggested, but acknowledged that it was during a depressing time of history.  I thought I would read the book and then get on to more pleasant reading.  I was surprised at what an excellent book this was.  I found the story, completely fascinating, and the point of view of the narrator to be excellent.  I couldn't put it down.

B00005K3NR|5.0|The CARRIE (SPECIAL EDITION) DVD is fantastic. Not only do you get a remastered version of Brian De Palma's masterpiece of horror, \\"Carrie,\\" but you get some good extras!<br /><br />The 1976 film was De Palma's adaptation of Stephen King's first novel, [[ASIN:0385086954 Carrie]]. And was executed perfectly! From casting to the sublime use of split screen to the use of sound to the soundtrack itself, CARRIE is a horror tour de force that keeps audiences in the grip of fear.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie or read the book it's about a shy and timid high school girl who has the power to move objects with her mind. She's picked on by the other girls, and her mother is a religious fanatic who beats her and makes her pray in a closet. Anyway, Carrie is the butt of jokes and one student feels sorry for her and gets Carrie a date to the prom. But a couple of students want to play a nasty trick on her and Carrie unleashes her rage on the entire student body!<br /><br />I remember seeing the movie poster everywhere during the 70s, when I was a kid,  and being absolutely horrified at the image of actress Sissy Spacek covered in blood. The stark whiteness of her skin and the red blood made a contrast that spooked the hell out of me. And she's the perfect actress to play the role. If ever there was perfect casting this was it. And so was Nancy Allen, as the popular mean girl in school; Amy Irving, as the sympathetic student; William Katt, as Irving's boyfriend and Carrie's date. Piper Laurie was brilliant as Carrie's demented mother and John Travolta was cute as Allen's bad-boy boyfriend.<br /><br />Anyway, the DVD comes with an insert booklet that provides trivia info on the filming, casting and behind-the-scenes of \\"Carrie.\\" Also, the DVD has:<br /><br />***ACTING CARRIE--Documentary with Spacek, Irving, Allen, Katt and Buckley among others (43-minutes)<br /><br />***VISUALIZING CARRIE--Documentary with Brian De Palma explaining the film and special effects of \\"Carrie\\" with footage and still from the filming (40-minutes)<br /><br />***CARRIE THE MUSICAL--Featurette about the musical (yes a musical!) based on the movie with Betty Buckley (6-minutes)<br /><br />***PHOTO GALLERY--Pics from the film (6-minutes)<br /><br />***STEPHEN KING & THE EVOLUTION OF CARRIE--Text that you can read on the screen about the creation of \\"Carrie\\" from idea to book to movie<br /><br />***ORIGINAL TRAILER<br /><br />And the DVD menu design is great too!

B00004XPPE|4.0|This movie stars Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau, with a fine performance by several other well known actors and actresses, including no less than Larry Hagman in what had to be one of his first movie appearances. Superbly acted all around.<br /><br />If you can get past the black and white film, this movie is a classic in all respects. Very realistic in it's portrayal of Cold War nuclear threat and the game theory associated with it, the movie takes place largely in Omaha at the Strategic Air Command Headquarters.<br /><br />The action really heats up when an inadvertent nuclear strike on Moscow is initiated. The film is well worth your time and money, regardless of whether or not you grew up during the Cold War period. It illustrates the horrors and potential pitfalls of the situations that could occur under the nuclear weapons defense system. The strategy known as \\"MAD\\" --Mutually Assured Destruction, was just that: insane. It also shows the dangers of allowing machines and computers too much control of our lives.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This is not their best album, but it is very good, and a good return to form.  Getting Rick Rubin to produce was a wise move, after their St Anger trainwreck.

B000PKG6TY|5.0|Es bien sabido que el mundo musical se ha nutrido de personajes extravagantes y de gente a la que un abusón se le comía el bocadillo del recreo. Sobre todo, esto lo saben bien en Estados Unidos, pregúntenle sino a Black Francis (el gordito de la clase que después se convertiría en líder Pixie) o a cualquiera que toque en Arcade Fire. Efectivamente estos raros elementos capaces de ver entero el programa de Saber Vivir, son capaces de convertirse a la larga en genios musicales, o a veces pueden incluso empeorar, ahí están los extraordinarios casos de Cañita Brava, El Arlequín o Pereza. Pues si cada humanoide ha conocido a alguien así, en la ciudad de Boise, pequeña capital del estado de Idaho deberían estar orgullos de Doug Martsch, el lider de los Built to Spill, que lejos de convertirse en dibujante de los extintos fruitis decidió montar una banda musical en 1992. La idea inicial de Martsch siempre fue la de rotar cual Vicente del Bosque a los músicos que grabarían con él y casi lo ha ido cumpliendo en cada disco.    Prototípicamente conocida por estar en el diccionario como definición de banda indie, sus dos primeros álbumes, \\"Ultimate Alternative Wavers\\" y \\"There´s Nothing Wrong With Love\\", se gestaron en los sellos C/Z y Up, cuando el grupo ya estaba pensando en ser ministros de igualdad por el escaso éxito inicial, se convierten en un fichaje de los Warner Brothers a tenor de su actuación en el Lollapalooza de 1995 , y no sólo alegró a sus familiares este contrato, sino que además consiguieron con acierto que el control creativo de toda su música recayera en el bueno de Doug. Su debut en Warner lo harían con un disco estupendo, \\"Perfect From Now On\\", de gran éxito de crítica aunque menos accesible para iniciarse con esta banda que su siguiente trabajo, \\"Keep It Like A Secret\\".    Es posible que el título del disco de una pista del carácter minoritario de su música, pero escuchando la gran mayoría de sus canciones es difícil pensar que ningún colectivo modernillo lo venere cual jersey de rayas de los Franz Ferdinand. El disco se inicia con \\"The Plan\\", una canción estructurada en las ácidas y potentes guitarras y el gancho vocal de la voz de Martsch y su timbre a lo Neil Young. Si el comienzo no te convence espera a escuchar \\"Carry the Zero\\", no valen excusas, su ritmo se te pegará desde la primera escucha. El disco mantiene toda la dulzura y la melodía pop con bases guitarreras en cortes como \\"Center Of The Universe\\", \\"Sidewalk\\" o \\"Bad Light\\". Otros cortes más divertidos y experimentales como \\"Time Trap\\" o \\"Temporarily Blind\\" permiten comprobar que gastaron bien la pasta de los de Warner en la producción y sin dejar a un lado el sonido rasposo, algo así como lo que ya hicieron los Pavement algunos años antes en \\"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain\\".

1402720602|4.0|Classical Guitar Making: A Modern Approach to Traditional Design is a gorgeous book about how to build a John Bogdanovich-style Herman Hauser I guitar. If you are an out and out beginning woodworker who wants to build a guitar from scratch you can make a guitar from this book, but you will either have to own or have access to the power tools that the author uses to build his guitars-a drum thickness sander, resaw bandsaw, and a bandsaw, to name a few. The author really doesn't go into how to use hand tools to build the guitar and doesn't offer alternative ways to use hand tools as does \\"Guitar Making: Traditional and Technology\\" by Cumpiano and Natelson. I bought \\"Classic Guitar Making\\" to see if I could learn any new tricks in guitar building and I did-how to laminate sides and his binding-cutter router attachment is pretty nice. If a person is patience and willing to take the time to methodically follow Bogdanovich's instructions you can build a wonderful guitar. That can also be said for \\"Guitar Making: Tradition and Technology\\", by Cumpiano and Natelson and \\"Making Master Guitars\\" by Roy Courtnall. A nice thing about both of these books is that the authors immerse you into the tradition of guitar making as if an old school master luthier was standing over your shoulder telling you about how Simplicio, Ramirez and Torres made their guitars great. Buy this book but only after you have first bought \\"Guitar Making\\" and \\"Making Master Guitars\\" and all the wood you want to build your guitar with. If you have the money to build and equip a full sized cabinet shop definitely buy this book.

B000KRNCYY|4.0|from the DVD. Missing was \\"Somewhere\\", \\"Ceili\\" and others. This CD sounds like it was produced in the studio and not taken directly from the DVD, which is marvelous. It lacks the spontaneity(sp?) of the live version.
0375826726|4.0|I have been a fan of these books since the beginning, and I would classify this one as his best yet. Eragon was choppy and slow in parts while Eldest had moments of capturing the reader, but was more of a love story. Brisingr, however, finally marks where Paolini grows into a more mature writer with his action and story telling ability.     New welcome twists appear and we finally meet (through Murtagh) Galbatorix. Yes, it is a classic and somewhat predictable plot, but it was a fulfilling read. This series is not too outlandish or weird, and you can identify with the characters. I look forward to the next and final book.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Ok. I am no professional reviewer so bear with me. For the last 12 years I have been more than a little disappointed with the music that Metallica has been producing. To be blunt, it just sucked. Death Magnetic does not suck. When I heard 'The Day That Never Comes' for the first time on the radio I was way less than impressed and just dismissed this as another failed attempt at a good cd. One day, not long after the album was released, I was in a music store and listened to most of all of the songs. They're too long to stand there and listen to every second in the store. I was pleasantly surprised, even with 'The Day'. So, I bought the CD. That's more than I can say for St. Anger. A friend burned me a copy of that morsel when it came out. (You read it right Lars) I listened to it once and it disappeared into the trunk of my car, never to be seen or heard again. I am 20 years older now than when Metallica and myself were in our prime so my take on music is a little different than it was then. Oh to be 16 again. I like this CD alot, but if this came out when I was 16, it would be the greatest CD ever made! So, keep that in mind when you listen to it. The times have changed, these guys have been through a lot and they still managed to get back on track. I'm not going to critique CD sound quality and musical nuances since I like the songs and the CD sounds great. I am reading about people whining about compression and clipping but I don't hear it. I may just be ignorant when it comes to those things. I know I'm not, but if I am, ignorance is bliss.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Eastern Promises delivers on acting, plot and drama and for that you will certainly want to see it... but be forewarned.    This movie received an R rating for a reason and I would not show it to any kids younger than high school age.  The violence in it is graphic for a reason - realism.  The subject matter is shocking at times, because you are dealing with very disturbing topics, so be prepared.    The story is that of the Russian mob in London, which primarily follows the actions of one family, and specifically the duties of a driver within that mobster family.  The movie does a good job of explaining the Russian mob and how it operates throughout the film.  To accomplish this it uses the sub plot of a maternity nurse who discovers a diary that belonged to a young pregnant Russian immigrant.  The pregnant girl dies while giving birth in the nurse's hospital.  The diary, and uncovering the facts and secrets within are what leads the nurse to encounter the mob firsthand.    Throughout the movie, the plot and twists are done exceptionally well and will keep you trying to figure everything out.  If you don't like movies where you need to focus on everything said, or don't like ones you have to think too hard about them, then Eastern Promises might not be your cup of tea.  If you like movies that keep you on the edge of your seat and trying to figure it all out - you'll enjoy this one.  The revelation discovered about the driver/mobster is well worth it the price of the DVD!    The movie moves along at a good pace and never leaves you bored with any of the scenes.  The final thirty minutes of the movie mixes enough action and twists to satisfy even the harshest of critics.  Enjoy it and be prepared to cringe now and again!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie takes place at a Funeral.  Hence the description, DARK COMEDY ~ If you are unable to find humor in this situation, then you will NOT like this movie.  HOWEVER, if you realize that in every situation, humor can and does exist, then you will be in for a very enjoyable 91 minutes.<br /><br />The parts are expertly played by a superb cast.  The script is witty and smart and the story is very well presented.  This movie was recomended to me, while at the same moment, someone else who watched it, told me it was terrible.  So, to qualify my taste, these are Dark Comedies that I have enjoyed watching in the past: \\"Head Above Water\\" ~ \\"Death Becomes Her\\" ~ \\"Little Nicky\\" ~ \\"Daddy's Dying\\".<br /><br />So, if you share my taste, you will want to watch this movie.  And if you liked this movie, you'll probably enjoy the ones listed above...  Have fun!
0451197879|3.0|Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) tackles the anti-hero with Bart Dawes, who paves a path to self-destruction through a series of deviant actions that - in his mind - may prevent a highway from paving over his home.<br /><br />The psychology of Dawes is painted by King in rich colors that become more and more smeared as his goal becomes more focused, yet more ridiculously unobtainable.<br /><br />That Dawes is driving himself down a dead-end road - with the guidance of several others - ultimately makes the mind games quite silly. But the novel keeps a decent pace for 307 pages and is a nice detour from the typical terrain traversed by King.
B001C08RHA|4.0|The sound effects were great - I thought the bullets were coming right at me. Great Movie everyone else agrees!<br /><br />We let our children watch this movie and had to have them close their eyes in some VERY violent scenes (at times my husband was the only one watching) and we had to fast-forward a sex scene at the beginning of the movie. HINT - watch all the credits you get a bonus!
B00005K3O0|4.0|\\"Audrey Rose\\" is a creepy occult thriller of reincarnation.  It is based on Frank DeFelitta's best-selling novel of the same title.  DeFelitta also wrote several other horror novels; one of which, The Entity, also became a box office success.<br /><br />  Marsha Mason and James Beck give wonderful performances as Bill and Janet Templeton; their daughter Ivy (Susan Swift) is tormented by nightmares of a girl, Audrey Rose, who died in a fiery car crash.  Movie legend Anthony Hopkins (\\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Magic\\") delivers a convincing performance as the mysterious stalker, Elliot Hoover, who insists that Ivy was his daughter Audrey Rose in her previous life (or incarnation).<br /><br />  \\"Audrey Rose\\" does bare some similarities to \\"The Exorcist.\\"  Each film has a tormented girl.  Regan of \\"The Exorcist\\" is possessed by a demon, whereas Ivy is obsessed by the memories of her former incarnation.  Instead of being treated by an exorcist, Ivy is treated by a hypnotist.<br /><br />  The viewer feels much sympathy for the tormented Ivy.  Susan Swift gives a great performance each time Ivy has a nightmare during which she believes she is trapped inside a burning car.  She bangs her fists against windows and turns over furniture.  Unfortunately, this particular scene is repeated too many times and loses its shock value.<br /><br />  \\"Audrey Rose\\" is a great introductory film for those who are unfamiliar with the Hindu belief of reincarnation.  During the courtroom scenes, a holy man explained that reincarnation is the eternal soul traveling from one body to another as it seeks perfection.<br /><br />  The ending was rater tame, predictable and disappointing.  Audrey Rose died in flames.  The ending should've been more fiery and explosive.  Nevertheless, it was sad.<br /><br />  \\"Audrey Rose\\" is a must see for those who believe in reincarnation and for fans of occult horror films, especially those made in the seventies.  Also recommended is \\"The Reincarnation of Peter Proud.\\"

B001C48EFQ|2.0|Vin Diesel turns out yet another of his stone-faced performances in this sci-fi futuristic flick about a miracle child, who'll supposedly save the world. I know, it reminded me too of \\"Children of Men\\", though the plot there was a little better explained and easier to follow, and made more sense.<br /><br />Babylon A.D. is a half-hearted attempt at making a sci-fi movie, but sadly the creators forgot the cardinal rules of sci-fi:<br />- make the plot EITHER a natural extension of the present, OR totally deviated from the present<br />- explain the concept of what makes up the sci-fi component in the movie to the audience so that you (can) create a following<br /><br />Neither of these happens. It's not explained how the plot begins, it is not explained who is Aurora or how did she become who she is (until very late into the movie), and worst of all, what is expected to happen after the movie storyline ends, is simply absent!<br /><br />Another defining aspect of a good sci-fi flick is the action sequences. This is something one would have expected from Vin Diesel too. However, all the action stunts in the movie suffer from an overdose of editing, and too fast camera movements. There is no actual fight sequence. You have to stare unblinkingly to follow what is happening, and after 5 minutes, realize that nothing much happened anyway!<br /><br />Michelle Yeoh is wasted in her role...<br /><br />Overall Rating: 1.5 / 5 (if only for the attempt!)
031606792X|5.0|I LOVED IT!!!!  I don't understand what all the negative comments are about.  IT IS A FANTASY.  I am glad I didn't listen to any of them, because I would have missed a great book.  I could not put it down.  I kept wanting to go the end to look to see how it turned out.  Loved the happy ending.  I will read the series again.
0465043577|2.0|Mandelbrot describes some problems with financial models that are designed to provide approximations of things that can't be perfectly modeled. He pretends that pointing out the dangers of relying too much on imperfect approximations shows some brilliant insight. But mostly he's just translating ideas that are understood by many experts into language that can be understood by laymen who are unlikely to get much value out of studying those ideas.<br />His list of \\"ten heresies\\" is arrogantly misnamed. Sure, there are some prestigious people whose overconfidence in financial models leads them to beliefs that are different from his \\"heresies\\", but those \\"heresies\\" are closer to orthodoxies than they are to heresies.<br />His denial of the equity premium puzzle is fairly heretical, but his argument there is fairly cryptic, and relies on suspicious and poorly specified claims about risk.<br />He says market timing works, but the strategy he vaguely hints at requires faster reaction times than are likely to be achieved by the kind of investor this book seems aimed at.<br />His use of fractals doesn't have any apparent value.<br />Mandelbrot is primarily a mathematician with limited interest in understanding how markets work. One clear example is his mention of a time when Magellan \\"was still a small fund, too small for any detractors to argue that its size alone gave it a competitive edge\\". Any informed person should know that's completely backward - larger funds have a clear disadvantage because they are limited to trading the most liquid investments.<br />Another example of a careless mistake is when he claims the evidence suggests basketball players have hot streaks, seemingly unaware that Tversky and others have largely debunked that idea.
015206396X|4.0|My pre-teen daughter snatched this book from the mailbox when it came and wouldn't let me have it until she had finished it and then begged me nonstop until I read it. I now know why.<br /><br />Kristen Cashore's debut novel is a delightful fantasy adventure filled with engaging heroes and thoroughly nasty villains. In the land of the seven kingdoms some children develop supernatural skills or Graces, not unlike the mutants seen in X-Men. What these Graces are are not always evident even to those who have them. As with all powerful beings, some cannot resist the temptation to abuse their powers.<br /><br />Katso and Po are two such Gracelings who have martial abilities far beyond those of normal humans. They are drawn to each other because no others can challenge them in fighting practice. When Po sets off to a neighboring kingdom to seek an explanation for the kidnapping of his grandfather Katso accompanies him and things quickly get very hairy for both of them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the book goes on for about 30 pages longer than it should. Like Lord of the Rings, she spent too much time describing in detail what can often be summed up with `and they lived happily ever after.' Even so, I still recommend Graceling.

1591841984|5.0|The book \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" is not your officially authorized biography of Steve Jobs, but a collection of business principles that Steve Jobs follows (and a description of some of his quirks).    The fact that this little book is neither written by Steve Jobs, nor reviewed or authorized by him, work in favor of this text and gives another spin to his work. While the \\"official\\" books on his live and his impact on Apple concentrate on a review of historical events and the results on the company or on products, this book puts a focus on how Steve Jobs works, what his business principles seem to be and how they effected the company, the products and the people surrounding him.    The focus is clearly on Apple, and on his second stint at this company. The years before 1997 or his work at NeXT or Pixar are only covered very briefly and no insight is given into his working at these companies.    Overall, I liked the book and I also think that the form of putting together mostly \\"secondary\\" information (quotes, interviews with coworkers, etc.) works in favor of it.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This was a great movie!  As with all movies of this genre, there were some silly & tired lines, but on the whole very enjoyable.  Kept you one the edge of your seat laughing.      Great flick to watch with the kids or by yourself.
B000025XKM|4.0|Like Jesus, Nick Drake is a resurrected musician with terrific guitar sensibility who unfortunately died while young in the early 70s, perhaps of a drug overdose, perhaps suicide (it's unclear.) He was re-discovered, posthumously, by an advertising person who played his music in an excellent Volkswagen ad. While Drake has a wonderful gift for creating beautiful guitar sounds through open-tunings and off-beat tempos, his writing is lackluster and imagistic and often melancholy, somewhat blurry. His singing voice is high-pitched, unusual, with overtones of American Indian religious chanting. So Drake is on the verge of singer-songwriter excellence, in my view, but not quite there. I think what's happened is that people today feel guilty because of Drake's untimely death and, as a result, have resurrected him to a status that may not be deserved. There's a cult underground of guitarists who extol his music but I wonder whether his reputation is overinflated because of his early tragedy; if he had lived, perhaps Drake would have become the wonderful songwriter which people presume him to have become.<br /><br />Thomas W.

0312360266|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I finished it in one sitting.  It is very well written, but for YA adult kind of explicit.  I loved the Twilight series and picked this series up to kind of find something new to read instead of reading the twilight saga over and over.  :)  I plan on picking up book 2 tonight.
B0002199H2|4.0|Somewhat difficult to get into the groove of listening, because the set is more of an academic study of the recording sessions with these two giants of the jazz world.<br /><br />I will edit the set to separate the listenable from the historic; some charts stop in the middle in order to begin another take.<br /><br />This set also includes several takes of the same chart, as well as different solo break overdubs.<br /><br />If you're looking for a set to immediately have for an evening's playlist, you'll need to spend some time picking and choosing.  You may prefer to purchase their studio CDs individually.  However, it's well worth the journey.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's Miles Davis during a very introspective yet lyrical point of his journey, and for me, while I could still understand what he was trying to achieve.
