B005LLSNNE|5.0|One of the best shows on TV! Very happy I was able to watch Season 4 and catch up.  Long live the Sons!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it! Bought the 2nd immediately after finishing it! Definite read for anyone, but it is R rated with a capital R...not for the faint of heart
0316227706|5.0|This is just a great book of photographs and if you love dogs it's even better. I am getting this for the dog-lovers I know this year for Christmas. I also think this would be a great book for any budding photographer. The idea of taking pictures of dogs underwater is a great one and some of these images are just incredible shots. It's a joy to page through this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just started the 2nd book the the series, and I have a hard time putting it down! It's full of emotion and surprise...a definite read for anyone.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I have seen the original series in black and white and loved it! This new series is proving to be just as good! I am hooked! It is good to see the character Rose again. She provides the continuity between the original series and the new one! I am glad I purchased the first season from Amazon. Now I can catch up with Season 2.

The DVD is EVEN BETTER with a revisit to some of the original lucky fans that went on the road to Pasadena with them...they're all grown up and STILL loving the best live band there is!

0307593312|1.0|If there is one thing this book accomplishes, it's the affirmation that human beings across the world, despite never meeting one another, agree that this book at 900 + pages is, to put it mildly, painfully laborious to read. What was Murakami thinking?  And who were the sex scenes written for, teenage boys hitting puberty? My God what horrible writing. All I can think of is that something got lost in translation. Maybe in the original Japanese language and within the culture of Japan the book resonates more deeply and with more interest for the reader and somehow when they translated it into English for western readers some cultural context, that would have provided more insight, got lost. The entire book reads like the following paragraph,<br /><br /> \\"Tengo awoke early. He went to the bathroom. He turned on the light. He looked in the mirror.  Tengo thought to himself, 'Am I still in Cat Town?' Tengo remembered having sex the night before. Tengo thought it was relaxing but it wasn't Aomeme so it was just an exercise. The bathroom light was bright. His stomach was empty. Tengo could feel the bathroom floor with his feet. There were drops of water in the sink. Ushikawas head was odd looking. The NHK collector would be here soon. Somewhere out there was Aomeme. She was thinking of him and he was thinking of her. 'I need to have sex', Tengo thought to himself. 'What year was it? How many moons are there?  Komatsu said write a lot and just keep writing, who cares if it's redundant.' Tengo was tired. Tengo was hungry and wanted to eat an Air Chrysalis with wasabi. Tengo went back to sleep. Tamaru sat in a chair.\\"<br /><br />To everyone who gave this book 3 or less stars, you are all geniuses.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|English, European sensibilities prevail but not incomprehensible or irrelevant for Americans.<br />The story's greatest strength is the very clear message that it's never too late to change,<br />find a new way of life and make choices that are best for oneself.<br />Also, the depiction of life in India was really refreshing. Makes one think about what's really important in life.<br />The acting was superb and never over-done.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was looking for a good romantic read, and read the recommendations and got this book on a whim. It is SO good. I couldn't put it down, I was up all night reading it. You will fall in love with Abby and Travis, the ups and downs keep you on your toes, and it will have you rooting for them the whole way!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All of Nicholas sparks's books are amazing but this one is too good to put to words. It is mysterious but it always makes you wanna cry and makes you grateful for your spouse loved it!!!!

1476712042|4.0|I've read other reviews about this book before I purchased it and I was a bit hesitate. I went ahead and ordered it out of curiosity. After I read the book I was still asking \\"where was the abuse?\\" Travis, the main male character, had a temper and at times the book was intense but not abusive. I enjoyed the book and had to keep reminding myself that these were young college students which explained A LOT of immaturity and naivety.

1400069289|4.0|Before I read this book I had no idea how strong the power of habit was and that you could use the power of habit to change your life. I always believed in programming and reprogramming dreams but never thought about applying that principle to habits. Charles Duhigg's book, The Power of Habit, was recommended to me before it was even released by someone who reads a couple of books a month. (Imagine pulling off a feat like that.) It was on his list of must-read books. I picked it up in July, a few months after its release. I wasn't sure how much I wanted to share about my experience reading the book. It was a last minute decision to make it personal.<br /><br />The stories about people like Paul O'Neill and Michael Phelps, the behavioral marketing tactics used to sell Pepsodent and for Target to zero in on customers, and the encouragement of societal habits by the Saddleback Church and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. were fascinating.<br /><br />As someone who could stand to lose a more than a few pounds, I have often told myself that \\"you need to change the way you do things and look at things (namely food and exercise).\\" Sadly, that's about as far as I had gotten with my endeavor to lose weight. Once I started to read the book The Power of Habit and learn more about cues, routines and rewards, my thinking and my outlook began to change. I'm not really sure what all of a sudden triggered it, but I started exercising (walking) with regularity and noticed the immediate rewards (normal blood sugar levels). I have only now started to incorporate the food part of the equation, but for the first time in my life, I'm happy that exercising has crept into my consciousness. I think about doing it even when I'm not doing it!<br /><br />Did the book provide a cure for all that ails me? No, but the one thing it did provide was HOPE that I could begin to do some things differently than I had been doing before. If I ever reach the 40 to 50lb weight loss goal, I will always attribute agood part of it to reading the book The Power of Habit!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really continues the spirit of the first book and develops the personality of Katniss. We learn a bit more about Peeta and the villain Snow is seen to be a horror of a person.<br />Excellent development
B008S847X2|5.0|Another great record by John Mclaughlin. Amazing playing all around and a high energy level in most of the tunes. Amazing grooves and interplay between all four musicians. I love Ranjit on drums.....but I loved Mark Mondesir with John as well. I am going back and forth over whose drumming i prefer. Both incredible players. Gary Husband's acoustic piano playing is excellent in Trancefusion.  I wish they had used the acoustic piano more throughout this cd,instead of some of the electronic keyboards used.  However kickass playing from Gary all around. Etienne is an absolute monster on bass. John's playing is fiery hot all over this cd. Man he has showed no signs of slowing down.  The man's playing is so damn tasty and he clearly still has all of his chops  A Master of the guitar indeed. (I would still like to hear him play some nylon string guitar as well though, as he did when Trilok was with him.) \\"Now Here This\\" is a great cd for any guitar and music lover. Just get it already!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is actually one app that seems to be better on Android! Used it to figure out pumpkin carving ideas. If you love Pinterest on the web you definitely need this app.
B000PMFTCC|5.0|another example of amazing early verdi operas, caballe & pavaroti always enhance whatever the sing, the soprano has 2 beautiful arias & the voice of pavaroti makes the opera really enjoyable. i never heard it before, it never called my attention, but lately in very interested on verdi's early work since i love doizetti & verdi's early works are higly influenced by the belcanto trend of the era lidered by donizetti. verdi has a personal touch in his orchestrations that makes his operas differ from donizetti, but the style is very similar.  for XIX century belcanto lovers is perfect other versions, with bergonzi or ricciarelli, really dont even appeal me to try to hear them.
0547564651|4.0|A short book, but slow read due to the technical aspects of the various articles, surveys and findings which Paul Tough discusses. This is not a bad thing, but unexpected.<br />While much of the book is or should be obvious to most people, I was looking for more depth around the main premise which suggests you can change someone's world.<br />How seems to be a big question mark.<br />Spending 10,000 hours to become a grand master at chess, while fine as a goal, does not help provide a more well rounded effort. Similar to football players that face life after the NFL, what do we do when we meet our goals? Creating new goals, in some cases, is not so simple and the author admits he himself spent a few months adrift in life while he tried to find his purpose. Lucky for him it was while he was in college.<br />For adults looking to make the choices that will obtain their wants or to help their kids seek these out, the book was lacking.<br />Life is not as simple or complex as Chess. One can review a game, but real life is not as simple. Way too many unknowns that influence so much.<br />I liked the book and learned quite a bit about Chicago schools as well as some findings of different surveys.<br />Would like to have seen/read more about how to find the choices, how to not be so single mindedly driven so you can obtain multiple goals. Wanting
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I had used cheaper stylus for my Special Ed kids and the shaft of the case carved into my iPad screen protector because of the squishy tip.  I love the Cosmonaut for OT fine motor exercises as well as practicing letters and numbers.  My students working on tripod grasp have more success with the larger barrel of this stylus.  The tip is not squishy so does not damage my screen protector.  I'm giving it 5 stars for the ways in which I use it with students age 4-7 developing their fine motor skills and doing apps related to their ASD.
0761169431|5.0|I often send books and magazines to prisoners.  It may encourage them in some small way and help them survive prison with their minds intact and ready to be responsible citizens once released.  Prisoners in the overcrowded prisons of California are allowed only ten books at a time. With such a limited number allowed they usually ask for dictionaries, foreign language learning text and such.  Many times books do not make it to the prisoners, but this one did and the man is delighted.  Thank you, Amazon.
B000SJJCX4|1.0|This tuner is a piece of crap, it takes forever to tell you what note you a hitting. Which makes it un-useable on stage unless you want the audience just starring at you while you make not a sound. Also it breaks super easy. TOTAL CRAP.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Waaaaaay too long; teeming with narrative and gaping logic holes.....this feels like a star-stuffed jamboroo for the adult cast to pitch in their huge pay checks for a beach house where they can go sit around and howl about how bad this movie is.<br /><br />Katniss kinda rhymes with 'can't miss'..... But she should be renamed Lustniss...which rhymes with 'must miss'-- which is my advice for anyone thinking of wasting time on this drivel.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Well done! I loved the intrigue and fast pace that kept me reading into the wee hours.  I would highly recommend this folk to anyone who loves adventures.
B0095R76EW|1.0|Not only will you wish they never get together.....you will want to commit each of them to separate institutions for whiny losers (him), and selfish hags (her). Over long. Awful.  Avoid.
B000003TAB|4.0|This was released during the peak of Nirvana's popularity (after Nevermind but before In Utero) to give the fans something to get them thru until the new album.<br />I'm guessing some of these are ones that didn't make the cut for Nevermind.<br />Good songs, all of them, some are real good.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Don't believe your friends who will tell you that this is some pinnacle of achievement in comic book film adaptations.  It isn't.  The super villain, Loki, is a bore that couldn't even make 'Thor' all that interesting.  And the machinations of locating and assembling the Avengers packs all the interest of mailing invites to a high school reunion.<br /><br />All that written, the action sequences are pretty cool, and the casting of the right guy for Banner/Hulk (Ruffalo) gives the rather formulaic business on screen a shot of energy.  Downey Jr. Is very good.<br /><br />Recommended at five bucks.
0316223239|5.0|I picked this up at the airport for something to get me thru the flight and then finish up at home.<br />I read about 20-30 pages on the plane and liked what I was reading but almost left it in the storage thing on the seat back !<br /><br />Once I got home, I finished it in a few days and couldn't wait to start lending it out.<br /><br />What a touching story. Feel your heart fill up with every passing page. 50 pages in I wanted to devote the rest of my life to making sure this never happened, and if it did, trying to repair it.<br /><br />I'm so glad I didn't buy that car magazine or Michael Crichton novel instead of this.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I really love this movie it made me sad happy and most of all laugh. I would recommend it to anyone with young children, this is really a family kind of movie.
B000002JNJ|3.0|The group was starting to show signs of breaking thru on this album.<br />There are few good high points but some of the songs are still lacking and Phil's vocals weren't up to where they would eventually be on the next few albums.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|If you enjoyed Stieg Larson, this one will keep you glued to the pages. I'm glad that I downloaded it.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is as good as gets for thrash metal. From start to finish, all the songs are good. Really heavy with a couple of \\"slower\\" songs to give your neck a short break from headbanging.
B003WEA4UM|5.0|Excellent writing. Novel idea. Better in text than on film, as is often the case. The era appropriate vocabularly presents a perfect showcase for the kindle dictionary feature.
B0049IHX2C|3.0|Not as good as the first one but that's not really fair to compare them. MIB 1 is great.<br />This is good but lacks slightly in every area.
B009CPJHY4|1.0|I rented this thinking it was a a sure fire bet...however, it was very disappointing.<br />No depth to the characters  and just boring at times....love Judy but this is the worst things she has<br />done in my opinion....not worth the rent.
B000000OSE|4.0|I could have done without the 'Live and Let Die' cover song but there is a lot of music on this CD. It has the crossover mainstream songs, the hard bangers and the in-betweeners. Doesn't leave you wanting more, full-filling in vocals, guitars, drums and overall band chemistry.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play 30kinds of solitaire.  love this version on my Kindle Fire! I especially like the complex graphic patterns shown after a win.  The cards are easy for me to read accurately.  one of my favorites for quick fun.<br />Easy to play and therefore relaxing.
B000001EHS|4.0|All of the big hits are on here although 'Pour Some Sugar on Me' and 'Rocket' are not the versions they were on the orig albums. 'Pour Some...' starts off different and 'Rocket' is shortened by 1-2 mins.<br />I kind of dropped off as a fan after Adrenalize so some of the songs I didn't know.
1451683405|3.0|On the back cover of this book Oliver Sacks praises Harris's pithiness saying \\"Free Will shows that Sam Harris can say more in 13,000 words than most people do in 100,000.\\" I can do even better than Harris.  I can say in 50 words what it took him 13,000 to say.  Here goes: In the late 1990s the band Semisonic enjoyed 15 minutes of fame with their song Closing Time.  The best line in that song is 'every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.'  Replace the word 'beginning' with 'cause' and 'end' with 'effect' and you have Harris's entire book.<br /><br />The simple idea that cause and effect extend in an unbroken line back before any of us were born strikes Harris as self-evident and he is mildly contemptuous of anyone who doesn't accept this premise without qualification.  In one section of his book he briefly addresses some of the arguments put forward in defense of free will. His treatment of quantum theory - by far the best of these arguments - is deeply unsatisfying. All Harris says is that the handful of philosophers who have not come around to determinism have pinned their hopes for free will on their wishy-washy understanding of quantum theory.  Harris acknowledges that there is an element of randomness to quantum processes and that this randomness does undermine \\"billiard-ball determinism,\\" however, he insists that it is a mistake to think that this somehow rescues free will.  He maintains that individuals have no input into the outcome of quantum randomness therefore it's foolish to equate quantum indeterminacy with free will.  And that's all he says.<br /><br />If I had this book a year ago I might have deferred to Harris's authority.  But I have read a lot about quantum mechanics since then, and can say that Harris's treatment of quantum mechanics is totally lame. Just about every book on quantum theory includes Niels Bohr's quote that \\"Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.\\" Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness by Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner is no exception.  But it is better than any other book I have read at explaining what about quantum theory prompted Bohr to make this statement.  The authors show how at the quantum level \\"reality\\" is literally unfathomable (or at least has defied all attempts to fathom it).  And since everything is ultimately composed of quantum objects this has profound implications for humanity.  They go on to show how the act of observation appears to influence reality at the quantum level, but exactly how or why this is the case is anyone's guess.  To their minds (and a lot of other distinguished scientists like John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner) it's difficult to escape the conclusion that consciousness is somehow linked to the material world through quantum mechanics. My theory is that the moment the wave function collapses is the moment the temporal meets the eternal.  Admittedly this is not a slam dunk for free will but determinists like Harris cannot simply ignore this argument any more than they can dismiss people who believe in free will as tender-hearted simpletons.<br /><br />While I did not appreciate Harris's mildly condescending tone or his shoddy treatment of quantum theory I did appreciate the format of this book and the clarity of Harris's thought. He only needed 66 pages to state his case.  I think a lot of authors who feel obligated to write 250 page books would be more effective if they distilled their ideas into a third of that length.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I will keep this short but sweet. I have always liked some of slipknots songs and have heard stone sour on the radio before. I Did not know that Corey was the singer in both bands until a few days ago. The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. Seems to me to be a toned down version of slipknot. Since I made the connection between the two bands I have bought all of the stone sour albums, and you could say am a hardcore fan! I hope they will Play the US soon so I can catch them live.

B00984668E|4.0|In my opinion, 'The Sword' are one of the best modern-day Metal bands. With that said, \\"Warp Riders\\" is undoubtedly my favorite album from these guys. To me, \\"Warp Riders\\" combines all of their best elements.<br /><br />Now we have 'Apocryphon,' \\"The Sword's\\" most experimental album to date. I'll spare you the details, but you'll know what I mean when you listen. My two complaints with the new album are as follows: First, it isn't as heavy as their previous albums (still heavy parts, but more Rock N' Roll themed riffs are present)and second, at few of the vocal compilations are a bit \\"meh.\\"<br /><br />All of this is of course my opinion. If you prefer the more \\"Rock N' Rollesque\\" side of \\"The Sword\\" that was introduced in 'Warp Riders' then you will most likely prefer 'Apocryphon.'<br /><br />We'll see as time goes on, but for now, this album is ranked as follows among the previous Sword albums:<br /><br />1) Warp Riders<br />2) Age of Winters<br />3) Apocryphon<br />4) Gods of The Earth
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game has a lot of memory so it causes all my other apps to run very slowly and/or freeze. Also, when I first tried opening the app for this game, it would fail to run and bring me back to the home screen. After attempting this several times with no success, I became motivated to write a negative review on this misleading product. Thought it would be fun, but I guess I'll never know due to the fact that it is unplayable.

B002NZV68U|4.0|I'm not a big fan of this version. I like the old one better. I like the music in the old one as well. Maybe it's the nostalgia of the old version.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun in every sense of the word. Great story, good graphics, clues when you want/need them, and moderately difficult (but not impossible!) games. You can make this as easy or difficult as you want and not lose any of the fun. Story was much longer than I expected - lots of goals to achieve! Absolutely worth every penny! !
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Gave me new appreciation for what being a SEAL means; and what our men and women go through to keep us a nation of freedom.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome! Couldn't put it down until I finished the whole series. Would recommend it to everyone.  Would have to say to buy all three books at same time so your not in limbo while you wait to get the next book.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The sound was off, the acting was off, the lighting was off, this was off broadway movie....watched 20 minutes, that was enough to turn it off.  I guess you have to be female to appreciate their corn ball lines and acting?  What acting?  Movie on the cheap.

0446580848|2.0|At the beginning I was a huge fan of John Corey. Unfortunately, DeMille has chosen to make him an annoying interuption in what could have been a very interesting story. Plum Island, The Lion, all very well written with great witt inserted by the author. However, to have Corey's sarcasim on almost every page, most of which was not funny, it made the book extremely difficult to finish. Should DeMille decide to author another book I will not be a purchaser.
B000OVLINI|5.0|One of the very best books I have ever read.  I originally purchased this book as I knew the setting was Barcelona, and I had recently visited there.  This book was an amazing piece of written literature.  It had all the elements I enjoy in a book; the flow of words, the suspense, the character descriptions, etc.  I was hooked right from the first pages (and it is a long book!). The father and son relationship, the beginning of their adventure, the cemetery of books, the secretiveness taking place throughout. Simply brilliant!  The mystery of Juian Carax.  I think it is an epic novel.  I hated for it to end, I was immersed in this book!

B007L3BMGA|1.0|A waste of money. I will not be purchasing or reading the rest of the trilogy. It was unrealistic and glorified the epitome of an unhealthy relationship. Based on the buzz I was expecting a much better read! Save your money, this selection is not worth it!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This review was originally published at [...]<br /><br />Uglies is one of those books you don't want to put down.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is an Ugly - a person who is no longer a Littlie, loved for being cute and silly, and not yet a Pretty, those over 16 years of age who have undergone extremely drastic plastic surgery to enhance every aspect of their appearance. The rationale for this radical surgery is that having big eyes, full lips, flawless skin and a perfectly symmetrical appearance makes people like you. It's simply human nature. Therefore, a society of people who all like each other at first glance will be peaceful, happy, and most of all, beautiful. Which is why the pre-teen Uglies are literally quarantined in their own school, with Pretty Town just across the river, beautiful and mocking.<br /><br />In my estimation, the Junior High Years were awkward enough without society constantly reminding you that you are 'Ugly' and therefore worthless the way you are.<br /><br />Needless to say, Tally is pretty excited about turning 16, becoming Pretty, and starting her 'real life'. She sees herself as flawed and terrible and worthless until that exciting surgery. When a new friend of hers disappears instead of undergoing the operation, Tally is implicated as a witness. Sure enough, Shay gave her cryptic instructions to follow her to The Smoke - a place where people can live how they want, and oddest of all, stay ugly forever.<br /><br />When Tally decides to betray Shay by infiltrating the Smoke for the Specials (read: scary bad guys responsible for keeping this seemingly perfect society in line), it doesn't feel like she had a choice at all.<br /><br />How could she stay Ugly?<br /><br />And then, out in the wild, she starts to discover her own mettle and worth. She learns to rely on herself and others. She begins to see Real Humans as... well, normal. People. Pretty or not. She discovers the real reason that everyone undergoes an invasive surgery, and decides she's never going back.<br /><br />Until the Specials show up.<br /><br />I loved the salute to 1984's Newspeak, which gets even better in the sequel.I loved the salute to 1984's Newspeak, which gets even better in the sequel.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|When you start reading Stardust, music will burst out of your kindle, kobo, other e-reader, cell phone, or actual physical book. Don't be surprised. This fairy tale is lyrical, and perfectly so: the body of words matches the soul of story flawlessly.<br /><br />I couldn't put Stardust down. Not that it's ridiculously exciting - though it is pretty darn exciting, if you ask me - but because it was cheeky and fun and beautiful. The characters are caricatures and it works. The setting is sinister and enchanting and not detailed enough, all at once, and that works, too.<br /><br />This is the kind of story you want to have basically memorized so that you can rhyme it off to your kids, night after night, and know that if they dream of it, they'll be dreaming in that special place reserved for the true art created by humans.

B009UR2QMO|5.0|Ok, I have written a review of Season 1.  I was going to wait until next year for Season 2 to finish before writing another review of the show, but decided to go ahead and write an episode review for the time being.<br /><br />In any case, I really like what they're doing with the show.  On this episode, they left out Emma, Regina, and Snow.  Instead concentrating on the heart-breaking story of Rumplestiltskin, Belle, and Bale.  We learn why Rumple made the choices that he did, and honestly can even symphatize with him.  In his shoes, I might have made the same choices.  You should watch and decide!  As I have said many times, the very best stories are driven both by plot and by character.  This episode was a very good example of good writing.  Lots of drama, as well as a fair bit of action and some swashbuckling.  And, in my opinion, Robert Carlyle basically steals most of the scenes that he's on.  Great to see an actor of his stature on television.  After all, this is an actor who has played a James Bond villain in the past.<br /><br />The story flashes back to the \\"past\\", with the humble weaver, Rumplestiltskin, doing his best to hold on to his family.  His wife has lost respect for him.  Not only that, she is bored with her life and finds herself falling in love with a rogue ship captain.  Rumple pleads with her to stay, for Bale's sake.  But she finally makes the choice to run off with the captain.  Meanwhile, in the present, Belle runs off and wants to make a new life for herself.  Mr. Gold enlists the help of the town's acting law enforcement, David Nolan, to help find her.  The dwarves, led by Leroy, continues to search for fairy dust.  And Ruby joins David and Gold to look for Belle.  To add complication to an already tense situation for Rumplestiltskin, Cora the witch comes back and befriends Hook, the ship captain.<br /><br />This show is something to look forward to on Sunday evenings.  Highly recommended.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|An original Star Trek movie with an entirely new cast.  A new Kirk, Spock, Chekov, Uhura, etc.  It thought<br />it would be sacrilegious but they won me over.<br /><br />Only one scene conflicted with Star Trek.  If you recall &#34;A piece of the action&#34;, Kirk attempted to drive<br />a car with Spock in it.  He was a terrible driver and Spock said he was a great captain but a terrible driver.<br /><br />Well, this book starts off with a young Kirk driving a car with daring.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was surprisingly excellent. It's very original, the plot is interesting and captivating, the villian is believable, and the characters are likeable & dimensional. You don't have to be a gamer or fan of the 80s to enjoy this book, but you will enjoy it more if you are either of those things (I'm a child of the 80s and a casual gamer, and I got about 75% of the references). Sometimes the pop culture references were a lot to wade though, but the plot always picked up when I started to feel that way. I learned that this was the author's debut novel after I finished it, which made the book even more amazing to me. This is certainly the best debut I've read in years, and in my top 3 favorite reads for the year.
B00514HDNW|1.0|I will never understand why people give reviews for products they don't own.  It's obvious that NONE of the people giving this \\"5 Stars\\" own it or have read it.  Half way through the ebook there's several pages missing.  No explanation.  Just a sudden jump from the end of one paragraph to the middle of another.
B009439HEY|5.0|Outstanding versions of classic Genesis tunes.  All good stuff (none of the 80's-and-beyond pop songs, thank goodness).<br />\\"Supper's Ready\\" is the absolute highlight for me.  What a treat to have a version in such clarity and played with such passion (the best version I've ever heard, in my opinion)!  Worth the price alone, but many other great renditions (Dancing with the Moonlit Knight, Can Utility....to name only two).<br />Some \\"Genesis-related\\" tunes by Steve are included at the end.  Fine songs by themselves, but they don't really fit into the nostalgic spirit of the main album.  Consider them bonus tracks.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|they only gave us only 27 missions. that's stupid need more misssion and $6.99 for this that's more stupid with $6.99 you could get 7 games with that for. 99 cents each

B009FZZK8I|5.0|This is a great show! I can't wait to see what happens as this new season unfolds. Everyone should at least give it a chance.
B003204MQS|5.0|I like the originality of this film,if it were not 4 different endings I would have thought it was real.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I am a huge fan of the show Castle and I have been trying to get to reading the books for about a year. I have to say that the book does not disappointed. It is true top the storyline and hum or of the show. I can't wait to read the other books.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wish I had that kind of power over a rich and beautiful man. I truly do love this book.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|It's difficult to approach this. It looks great on blu ray - the detail is amazing, and in places the acting is superb. Michael Fassbender does another incredible job, and his role as an 'artificial person' is tremendous. The rest is less good. The plot isn't very compelling, the acting elsewhere is not too impressive (Noomi Rapace being an honorable exception), but the sfx are incredible.<br /><br />I felt let down by this. The 'Alien' franchise has two very strong entries and a fair amount of disappointment. I wasn't hugely impressed by this but am glad I watched it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this. I found myself imaging I as Anastasia. The entire book was captivating and I've found myself reading it more than once.

B009KHBDUU|2.0|Mix between Edward Scizzorhand and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Not really worth seeing. Not like original and a weird storyline. Would have probably been better animated.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I highly recommend this movie .Brings back great memories for me. A must see!The scenery is fantastic it gives you that summer beach feel to it.The acting is supurb!
B007Q35PLI|4.0|First rented this at a local movie rental place. After watching, just had to have it to see again and again! This is a charming movie that encompasses the struggles and challenges of life, opens you to new understanding of autism, but encourages us all. It is super \\"family\\" oriented movie.It makes you laugh and cry and come away with the challenge of, even though we might struggle, our dreams can be attained. Loved it so much...might just be on my top ten favorites now!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This game was fun at first but when you actually play it you realize its stupid. The controls are weird. Not the best game. :/
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is a wonderful story and yes I agree it does compare to Memory of Running which I also loved. Would recommend!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This wasn't as good as the first book. Maybe I'm growing tired of the sex but I didn't find this one as intriguing as I had hoped. Still, the ending was the best part and I still enjoyed it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I literally cannot stop playing this game. The one thing that is kind if a pain is that every now and then gameplay will be choppy &amp; lag a bit. But otherwise, like I said in the title of this review, I LOOOVE THIS GAME!!!!

B0053O89U6|5.0|Modern Family is a fantastic show, and this Blu-ray is great quality. The Menu is easily navigated, and the picture quality is crisp. If you're looking at buying, you don't need to be sold on how hilarious and entertaining this show is. If you're debating between the DVD and Blu-ray, I'd say go Blu-ray since, at least when I purchased the price difference was only 5$ for the blu-ray quality discs. Enjoy!
1742200206|2.0|I bought this 2012 edition hoping it would have up-to-date information but this has probably been one of the least interesting or informative Lonely Planet books I've ever read.  Not quite sure how they have managed to make NYC seem so boring.  The shopping guide is terrible, as is the eating and clubbing guide.  I stopped reading it pretty quickly and found internet searching more informative.
B000067QMD|4.0|This was the perfect addition to our bottle collection. I'm a breastfeeding mom who pumps for one bottle a day and am happy to be able to store milk in the fridge and then simply exchange these inserts for the nipple. Great purchase if you're using Avent bottles already. With that said, it advertizes that you can write on the lids... I'm not really sure how one would do this (with what kind of pen) and be able to reuse.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  However, I've given it only 3 stars because I thought it was entirely too long, laboriously detailed in some sections, and did not wrap up the story well.  I also gave it 3 stars b/c I enjoyed the author's bravado in creatively bringing to light the social ills of current day society in many parts of the world...though it seemed to be set in England.  Good read...if you have patience with minutiae.
0307593525|5.0|My husband bought this set for my birthday. It is just as expected and of course the contents is fantastic. The look is great, and the packaging is nice. I'm very happy with this purchase... if you've been waffling, go for it! And then make some crepes and baguettes and aspic :)
0385344333|1.0|I have read all the Reacher stories, some were great, some were good, but this one was AWFUL!  Boring characters, boring dialog, boring plot, boring action...oh, never mind, there was NO action till the end...and the only character I liked gets killed. I didn't even like Reacher in this story.<br />And as for Tom Cruise as Reacher??? Please!
B00943SP0G|2.0|The movie starts well and slowly deteriorates. The ending couldn't come sooner and I would have preferred waiting to watch at no cost.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|A good, quick, overview if you are interested in building a kindle book.  Not a lot of depth, or many pages; however, it sets you in the right direction. I would recommend it as a first step.
B007SGM084|5.0|I find a book to be pretty darn good when I finish it and right away want to read it again! and with these books that's all I could think about when I finished the last book! It's so easy to fall in love with these flawed characters!  I would compare these books with the Twilight series with some amazing x-rated scenes! I would recommend these books to anyone who loves a good love story!!<br /><br />In the last book you get a tease of what was going on through Christian's head during the first book... I wish it was the whole book through his point of view, I would've really loved to get to know him better!! Still he's one of my favorite male lead characters!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie because I am a big science fiction fan.I was very disappointed. It seemed to be an uninteresting mixture of the movies, Contact, and Alien. Both of these movies I enjoyed watching, but Prometheus, I did not enjoy and at the end wished I had my four dollars back. I am still waiting and hoping for someone to come out with a good science fiction movie.I do love to watch them .
B009A3NGF4|5.0|At first I was a bit disappointed with the number of tracks that were on the album, but once again quality surpasses quantity. A nice mix of up-beat and dreary, this album has become one of those that I can play over and over again and never get tired of it. 5 stars from a die-hard fan.
1611761557|5.0|Loved the book and loved that it was read by John himself.  It was great to hear the emotion in his voice as he read, all the different inflections in his voice...like he was telling me the story rather than reading me the book. I laughed, I got teary-eyed, I loved it!
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter is 11 and is a HUGE Hunger Games fan. I am gifting this to her for xmas. She is going to love it. Not sure I want her opening it and playing with it, almost more of a collecters piece but it is very cool.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Banksie does a great job of immersing into the Culture once again and its surrounding group of weird, stylized and silly species with their idiosyncratic motivations. The characters, especially the Ship-Minds, are entertaining. I usually enjoy these romps. The only downer for me is that the finish seems to make absolutely no difference whatsoever in terms of resolving the conflicts that are mounting throughout. It seems we are being told \\"the journey is all the fun, it doesn't matter how it turns out or who was 'good' or 'bad'\\", which I find unfulfilling. So as long as you enjoy the ride and the fact that the universe is chaotic and there really is no clear winner, you'll be entertained.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I could not leave this book off my hands.<br />One must keep on reading in order to know what's will happen to Ana and her 50 shades.<br />Highly recommend !!!<br />Love it!!!<br />Now I'm in the midlle of book three

B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I've got a fairly tricky GV- based system with a combo of analog and digital cameras. It took me a while to figure how to configure the app to talk to my system.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works wonderfully!  Besides my morning alarm I can set it for lunch and breaks and then bury my nose in my current book with out clock watching.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This is not the tense, intricate and intelligent story telling I fell in love with when I started reading the Scarpetta books. The story revolves around loosely connected sub plots that are tied together at the end with an obscure explanation  pulled, seemingly, out of the clear blue sky. And the blatant use of product names really cheapened this reading experience for me. While the actual process of investigation and forensics are more prominent in this book, I felt the interactions between the primary characters was pretty stale. I admire the writing ability of Ms. Cornwell, but this and the last few books feel like a formulaic effort to just churn out a book every year. I would rather wait a couple of years between books and get something more representative of Ms. Cornwell's talent.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I have the Bk-2, 7, and 9, and just bought this knife out of curiosity.  It is a &#34;beast&#34;. It reminds me, in a way, of the Bk-2.  Heavy thick blade. Nice and sharp. Used it in the yard to trim back one of my Neem trees and it did a good job. Still paper cutting sharp.  Very happy with this knife and recommend anyone interested in it to go for it.<br />Sheath is good. Has two &#34;ribs&#34; inside the plastic liner to keep the knife from rattling around, and an extra pocket, very similar to the Bk-7 and 9 sheaths.  I added two eyelets to the sheath so I could use a secondary retention system made of paracord. Did the same for the Bk's since they came with the eyelets already there. Don't know if that's what they were for, but it works fine.
B000V39KDO|5.0|300 was a good movie. The CGI was used extensively and it was well done. The blu-ray was a good transfer and was worth the price. I enjoyed it very much.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|If you like the Vampire movie the \\"Priest\\", then you will Love this movie. Stunning high visual and heavy hitting action.  Top (A +) CGI, and stunning cinematography. Beautiful period wardrobe and stunning period sets. A-list acting from all actors. Superior script that works. Don't be put off by the Lincoln idea, the script actually works...and the young man selected to perform Lincoln does a damn good job of it, from start to finish. This movie has some of the most stunning balls-to-wall action I have ever seen in a movie...and gives competition to the Underworld, and the Blade Movies!  Remember this movie is produced by A-List Director (Tim Burton), and he does not put out Bulls*** movies!  This is an  A-List Vampire movie and is one of the best Vampire action movies that I have ever seen in a while. This movie is different and takes you to another place and time. It's made very well I must say.  In closing, this is not a movie you would rent. This is a rare kind of movie that is destined to be a classic, so you (WILL) want to buy it on Blue Ray! This is my Opinion. Thank you!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It was an awesome movie, but so have all the other comic book movies, so far! It was much better in 3D though. Maybe another plug for a different movie, but Transformers, The Dark of the Moon has been the best 3D movie I've seen on my big screen TV!
0399157565|1.0|This is not the \\"old\\" Scarpetta, I don't know who it is.  In fact, who are all of these people?  Definitely not the characters I found so compelling and interesting when the series first started.<br /><br />The plot is only mildly interesting and Lucy's behavior is obnoxious and not even mildly interesting.<br /><br />The dialogue is stilted, broken and sometimes just plain weird.  I'm done with Cornwell and with Scarpetta. I'm just sorry I paid full price and I didn't wait to buy this until it was in the bargain bin.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This 2nd book is so much better than the first!  Now I am entwined in Eva and Gideon's messed up lives and can't stand the thought of having to wait until May to see how it ends!!  Write faster Sylvia!!!

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Being consider the best hero movie right now and I have to say that's true for so many heroes the movie work very well.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Not bad, it will keep you entertained. It's not a Emmy contender but if you've got no other choices, it will do.
0385344333|2.0|I was very disappointed. This is not the Jack Reacher I know and love.  Why is Lee Child trying to destroy the best character to come along in fiction in many years?  Seems like Child just called it in.  Maybe he's preparing us for Tom Cruise playing Reacher.  I didn't like Reacher being rescued by the women.  I'm a woman and I want a hero, not this guy.
B00846REIS|4.0|What can I say - I am a sucker for these torrid, dysfunctional love stories. This one has so many similarities to Fifty Shades and yet I still found myself glued to the pages and completely invested in Gideon & Eva. Cary is a bonus in the story, offering an occasional entertaining break from the main characters. If you loved Christian & Ana, you'll be rooting for Gideon & Eva to leave their baggage behind and live happily ever after!
B009329Y30|5.0|This is an awesome love story we thouroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I recommend it to all adult viewers
B003ITZBVS|5.0|As I was saying, if you enjoyed the animated series from the 90's or the Tim Burton style of dark/brooding atmosphere, you'll love this animated movie. I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone so I'll just say what I think makes this movie so good without giving away too much. In \\"Under the Red Hood\\", Batman is portrayed as a hybrid of the dark knight from the kid friendly \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" of the 90's and the portrayal shown in Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" from 1989. Both Batman and Bruce Wayne are portrayed perfectly by Bruce Greenwood. All of Batman's gadgets and vehicles (including the Batmobile and the Batwing) all very closely resemble 1989's portrayal while also blending elements of the animated series. The Joker appears in this a lot and is again a hybrid of Mark Hamill and Jack Nicholson's portrayals of the Joker and the blend is superb (although the new voice may take some getting used to at first). Nightwing appears here and his outfit and demeanor is much less out of place than Robin but he can still kind of make things campier than they need to be at times (luckily, he isn't a main character and isn't featured much). Robin is a secondary character yet he is the basis of the story (I won't lay out the plot except that this involves Batman's failed training of a second \\"Robin\\"). I love the fact that this movie is PG-13 because it allows the story to be told in a way that it never could have if it were targeted to a younger audience. The reason it got the rating is that people die in this (sometimes brutally), they are tortured, there is more profanity, more talk about drugs and in-depth details of organized crime, and probably the fact that it's just much more bloody and dark. This movie has very few flaws though and I would rank it up there with some of the better live-action Batman movies (not to mention the superb \\"Mask of the Phantasm\\").<br /><br />For die-hard Batman fans, this is a must buy.<br /><br />For fans of live action Batman movies, take a look at some of the animated series shows or movies first.<br /><br />For fans of the animated series, be warned that this is much more intense than what was released in the 90's or targeted to children back then with the straight to movie releases.<br /><br />Recommended.e a look at some of the animated series shows or movies first.<br /><br />For fans of the animated series, be warned that this is much more intense than what was released in the 90's or targeted to children back then with the straight to movie releases.<br /><br />Recommended.
1451620829|5.0|While it's been little secret that both co-founding members Peter Criss and Ace Frehley have been publicly assailed by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons for years. This unprovoked criticism has made many within and outside the fan base take pause and wonder why they've gone to such lengths to discredit these members. Turns out Stanley and Simmons were the ones people should have been questioning more. When Stanley and Simmons were taking credit for the band's origins, it was truly Sean Delaney and Bill Aucoin that provided the image that people know today. Sean Delaney even created the stage persona's for both Simmons and Stanley. Neither Stanley or Simmons contributed to the final version of what people have watched for the past 39 years. What the story also shows is how much KISS actually needed Peter and Ace,between the years when the band was failing which includes an IRS audit that nearly ruined all four original members. As it turns out, THIS ultimately became the root cause for the reunion tour. But Stanley and Simmons contractual abuses are well documented here, as well as their deliberate attempts to misrepresent the buying public about who were on albums like Psycho Circus and cover up the pay offs offered to Peter and Ace NOT to play.<br /><br />And while the book paints an unsavory picture of two people who are starved to rip off the public to make a buck, it takes no less mercy on the author himself. Peter Criss is a man with as many insecurities as he has mishaps. Rabid drug abuse nearly killed him and ended his initial career with KISS. Terrible marriages ridden with endless infidelity along with verbal and physical abuse do not paint Criss as a person many would have cared to have known back in those days. No one gets away clean in this book. Least of all, Ace. He too is shown to have many a problem that has been talked about before, but not in such detail as what it is here.<br /><br />As it turns out KISS, in the late 70's, was a band barely keeping itself together with two members steeped in drug addiction, one member lost in sexual addiction bordering on criminal, and the lead singer struggling to find his own identity as he cycles through endless psychiatrists, popping pills, and struggling to feel \\"important\\" to the world of music. This is truly the best written and most honest accounting yet of a band that has lived off it's merchandise more than it's records. And it's image today is nothing short of embarrassing as Stanley and Simmons tours in small venues with two imposters pretending to be Ace and Peter, which apparently is needed since Stanley was wiped out by his divorce back in 2003. We get to see Simmons and Stanley in their true form, which reveals not people shining as artists so much as opportunists. A courageous and eye opening account of one of the biggest frauds ever perpetrated on this country. You wanted the best, today you got something less.self together with two members steeped in drug addiction, one member lost in sexual addiction bordering on criminal, and the lead singer struggling to find his own identity as he cycles through endless psychiatrists, popping pills, and struggling to feel \\"important\\" to the world of music.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|On the fence with this 2nd installment of the series...<br /><br />It is an exhausting roller coaster read and really justifies the \\"dark and dangerous\\" reference to Gideon Cross. I hope that there is redemption coming for these characters.
B00932HEX2|5.0|Simply could not stop watching. Odered one episode after another and then bought the entire first season. the actors were fantastic and deserved their Emmy Awards. Fair warning: this show is highly addictive.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A refreshing look at how it feels to have an abnormal face in a world of junior high school. This book will hopefully open minds as well as hearts.
1401207529|5.0|A must-read Batman story. In my opinion, it is even better than Miller's The Dark Knight Returns: no Robin, no mutants, a spotlight on Jim Gordon and a really dark Dark Knight. A little outdated in appearance, and I'm not a fan of the art, but otherwise perfect.<br />If you'll like this, I strongly recommend to see the animated movie which has an updated appearance, but is otherwise very close to the story.
B00004W221|2.0|I thought the message of the movie was excellent. But hollywood has ruined a lot of good movies with filthy language. I wanted to show this to my grandchildren. When they took God's name in vain I couldn't show it to anyone, much less my grandchildren. My wife wanted me to send it back, but for the cost I'll probably throw it away.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Much better than Feast!!! I would like for GRRM to pick up the pace of book releases and the amount of books he writes in this series instead of branching off.
140053271X|5.0|Extremely long battery life, easiness of use, low weight, high build quality, huge book selection, and affordable price make this hands down the best e-reader you can buy for under $100.  Very impressed.
B003G4W49C|2.0|The book has an interesting premise and a good plot twist, but the characters are so shallow and unbelievable that I would only recommend this book to kids, or only to anyone who has never read actual good literature.
B0090X4GJE|4.0|\\"Lights\\" was a sleeper hit for Ellie Goulding. It was just one of those songs that needed to be played repeatedly in order to fully appreciate it. The same principle works for Goulding's sophomore album \\"Halcyon\\". It is a very appropriate title, since its meaning of calm and serenity perfectly describes this set as a whole. Starting with the warped voices and eerie production of \\"Don't say a word\\", Ellie's musical direction is far darker than that of her debut album \\"Lights\\". And while her vocals stretch far beyond her range, this strain comes across as endearing rather than irritating. Each song is packed with emotion, so there is no filler here. Each song was crafted perfectly to fit Goulding's musical and artistic vision. From the fantastic anguish of \\"My Blood\\" to the indie paradise of \\"Figure 8\\", she proves a song can be both meaningful and catchy at the same time. She does not need any auto-tune or drum-like synthesizers to make a track superior to the rest of the pop and indie pack. She sets herself far above those peers by finding the perfect balance of electronica and raw vocals. And the synths, the beating drums, and simple lyrical content only add to the brilliance of this album. While it is not quite indie, rock, or even pop, it's rather a happy medium between those three. Just like her smash single, Ellie Goulding shines throughout each of \\"Halcyon\\"'s 14 tracks, because while the producers provide interesting and chilling tracks, the strength of this album comes down to Goulding herself, and the sentiments she provides. While \\"Halcyon\\" is not a perfect album, mainly due to its redundant nature and its jilted momentum, its far more mature than any other album released in 2012. Besides the heart-break anthems of Adele, and the equally compelling rock of Florence + The Machine, Ellie Goulding is best Brit to grace the mainstream of the US in a very, very long time. \\"Halcyon\\" is not quite as sleek as \\"Lights\\", but it's still a beautifully charming effort all the same.
B009329ZF2|1.0|I knew the reviews were bad, but we still gave it a shot. The movie is SO bad, the plot is so ludicrous, the characters as cliche as they could be. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I fee appalled that I literally WASTED 2 hours of my life watching this.

B005WUHAX8|3.0|I like this case because it is slimmer than other protective cases. I do not like that it is very difficult to turn on vibrate or turn sound back on. Many many times I have tried to get the switch to work through the case and it not respond in any way. I also do like how difficult it is to plug in to charge, particularly with the car charger. Other than that, it is a good case.

B0091THRCU|1.0|The stitching started to unravel and break at the side pressure points along the top within a week of use. The plastic piping along the top of the phone quickly starts to delaminate and wear away. The design is poorly implemented and the materials are inadequately durable. The \\"leather\\" is low grade and not really leather at all, and the non leather lining is quick to degrade. The slot in which to keep credit cards is entirely impractical since the design calls for them to be so tightly inserted that it is awkward to remove them without first removing the phone. So you are stuck with balancing your iPhone in one hand, your credit card in the other hand, and your Snugg case in another hand. Oh, hold it. You only have two hands! Get the point? Sooner or later, you will drop your iPhone trying to get out your credit card.<br /><br />If you are inclined to think, \\"It's $19.99 and you get what you pay for,\\" stop thinking that. This product is so cheaply made that even at $19.99, you are not getting any value for your purchase whatsoever.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I am only about 25 games in but most are decent thouh not always challengiing. A couple have been better than others and it is generally a fun way to waste a little time. There are some control issues with a couple of games as well but overall play is good.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I came into SOA late in the game.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, I was able to watch everything from the very beginning.  Season 4 was excellent, just like the first three seasons.  The action is not over the top, the stories are a little strong, but believable, and Jax is on the way up!  Plus, being from Modesto in the 209 area code, I love knowing the area...all of it except Charming of course...hahaha.

0515149489|5.0|This was my first time reading a Nora Roberts book. I liked the fact that I did not want to put the book down.<br /><br />I don't want to give too many details about it as to ruin it for the reader and I have not read any of her other books, so I can't really give a comparison to her other books; however, I can say that it was good reading with some suspense, a little quirky romance, and some interesting information about dog obediance.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Much in the spirit of the DSI title, this game seems to pick up right where you left off. With several events as well as extra mini-games, this title raises above being another Farmville clone. But only barely so. At least the game notifies your Kindle when your energy is full, a feature that would be nice on other similar games. Of course, games that don't rely on a Skinner's box for replay value tend to feel a little nicer.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Love the Jack Reacher books.  This one is a \\"cant put down\\" winner !!!  Well done Lee Child.  I have read most of his books.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Let's start by saying I loved City of Bones. I rated it 5 stars so I absolutely adored it! I did not adore this book, I only \\"liked\\" it, and barely. The first 350 pages were doing nothing for me, I actually had to force myself to read this and honestly if it hadn't of been for Bout of Books and my insistence to finish it, I would have tossed it aside.<br /><br />City of Bones left me wanting more, so much more. I was absolutely devastated that Jace and Clary were brother and sister so I could not even understand how Cassandra Clare was going to make that play out. Within about the first 50 pages I quickly realized that City of Ashes did not have the fast pace of City of Bones-it almost seemed rather predictable. The Simon situation was predictable, the Alec-Magnus situation was predictable, I just could not believe that this was the continuation to the book I loved so much.<br /><br />I am happy that I forced myself to finish, the ending was satisfying to me. The last 100 pages really flew by and I read it in one sitting. It was very action filled, their was a few things I didn't expect and it ended on a good note.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to reading City of Glass, I have heard from several people that was the best one of the series so I really hope I am going to rediscover the love I had from City of Bones. City of Ashes was OK, but just not as enjoyable compared to City of Bones.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|I am very happy with my purchase. It was just as I expected. It was exactly as they described and I was not disappointed.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Pandemonium leads off exactly where Delirium ends.  Lena has made it into the wilds safely and luckily was rescued by a group of invalids who have taken her in. This book alternates from \\"Then\\" which takes place when Lena first went into the wilds and \\"Now\\" which is when she is living in public pretending to be cured. \\"Then\\" tells about Lena learns to survive without Alex in the wilds and adapting to a whole new way of life. \\"Now\\" details when she is living in the city and there is talks of a revolution taking place. With twists.<br /><br />I loved this sequel... loved, loved, loved it. For the first ten-ish chapters, I really wasn't enjoying it mainly due to the reason that I was nearly as devastated by the fact that Alex was gone as Lena was.  As Lena talked about being without him my heart was literally breaking, it was so sad and I spent the entire first part of this book crying  Once it started to focus more on \\"Now\\" I started to enjoy it more as there is a new character introduced, Julien. The only qualm I had about Pandemonium was the alternating chapters. I read this about 4 months ago, so now as I reflect back on the alternating chapters it doesn't bother me as much and I actually liked that part but at the time, it was driving me nuts! I just wanted to focus on one part of the story. Once I got used to that, it was ok but compared to Delirium where it flowed consistently in the same time period it was hard to get used to.<br /><br />Lena is a different girl in Pandemonium. She is much stronger but is much more depressed. Lena's sadness with Alex deeply affected me. But of course Alex is my book boyfriend so that is to be expected  I loved Raven as well. She came off as such a hard, cold person but in reality she deeply cared for the people around her. I also, shamefully, admit that I did start to like Julien. I knew there was going to be another love interest in this book- it wouldn't be YA without several love interests but I was surprised how deeply opposed to it I was. I seriously am Team Lena & Alex forever, so it emotionally hurt me to have Lena look at another guy. Needless to say I did start to like Julien as he was so innocent and naive it was almost hard to dislike him.<br /><br />There is a major plot twist in at the end, and true to Lauren Oliver form, she leaves you with a cliffhanger. I won't spoil it for anyone who has read it although if you haven't read it yet: you need to! It's just as amazing as Delirium. Lauren Oliver, of course, has another beautifully written novel under her belt. Astonishing.<br /><br />I can almost not wait for Requiem... In the entire year of 2013, I know this is, and will be, my most sought after and anticipated book. It's almost a tragedy though... because this beautiful series will end.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|The Lovely Bones is about Susie a young girl who was murdered and is now viewing Earth from Heaven. It shows the struggles that her family is facing with her being gone, her father's struggle with finding her killer, and all of the people she left behind dealing with letting her go.<br /><br />How did I wait this long to read it? This book was such a heavy, emotional read but at the same time it didn't make you physically cry. Ghosts terrify me so that was one of the reasons I put it off for so long until my sister finally convinces me it wasn't really about ghosts. The writing was very beautiful and kept you hooked from page one.<br /><br />All of the characters were very well developed, there was nothing lacking in any of the characters personalities. My favorites were her sister Lindsay-who's struggle to come with Susie's death was so personal and quite, Ruth-the girl that was affected deeply my Susie's death but hardly knew her in life, and Susie's Dad-he reminded me a bit of my father and his struggle to deal with the death of his oldest daughter was so heartbreaking.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with the ending. I thought everything came together really well and I loved how it ended with second to last scene being with Lindsay & Samuel. (Which I won't spoil for anyone that hasn't read it!!)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone likes heartfelt and emotional driven books! It will make you very sad in parts but also very happy in other's!
B009CPES4I|5.0|I loved this show!  I have always wanted to go to India and this showed me a little more about the country.  The actors are superb, not a dull moment in the entire movie.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I read Delirium months ago and still haven't posted a review. Why you ask? Because it honestly took me this long to put into words how much I love this book without rambling on and on<br /><br />Delirium takes place in a future United States where they believe love was the cause for the shattering of the world as we know it. Due to this a \\"cure\\" is developed for love, where it blocks it from happening so you don't become \\"crazy\\". Every person when they turn eighteen will get the injection and never be able to love again. You are matched with someone that will be a perfect fit for you for the rest of your life, but you will never love them. Love is evil. After you get the cure you are unable to love but you also are completely desensitized to the world around you, nothing overly excites or upsets you.<br /><br />I thought the concept of this book was amazing. Who would ever think that love would be the reason for all unhappiness? The most ironic thing is that when it is talked about and details all of the symptoms and side effects, it actually does sound like a disease? Love will make you do crazy things? Feel sick when you don't have it? Cause you not to eat? Doesn't that sound like a disease?<br /><br />The world is not much different than the one we have now, except for the fact of the restrictions. There is also several barren places but what the actual world looks like I picture to be fairly similar.<br /><br />The main character is Lena. Lena is just shy of her eighteenth birthday so she will be receiving her cure soon. Her best friend is Hana, who will also be receiving her cure soon. The story revolves mainly around them for the first part. Hana is the rebellious one of the two and she is trying to live her life as much as she can before it's taken from her. The summer before they will be cured they meet Alex, who they both think has the cure. It is later discovered that Alex does not have the cure, he is actually from the Wilds-where people have hidden who refuse this new life.<br /><br />As you can guess Alex and Lena fall in love. Ohhhh do they ever fall in love, and I'm fairly certain that I fell in love with Alex right along with Lena. There love story is amazing and Lena realizes that she doesn't want to have the cure-she never wants anyone to take away what she feels for Alex.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the characters in this book. I absolutely loved Lena. She was sooo scared of rebellion and she slowly opened up to Alex and it was beautiful. I also loved Hana, and I loved that Lena was so loyal to her even when she didn't think Hana was right.<br /><br />The ending is ... mind blowing. That's the only way to describe it. I didn't have any clue that it would end like that and thankfully I had waited so long to read this that I already owned Pandemonium. I think I would have went crazy waiting. My heart was exhausted after reading this book. I felt so much for Lena and Alex.<br /><br />It's an amazing, amazing book. Lauren Oliver is such a wonderful writer, she completely engulfs you in the story and the world she has created. If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was way better than the first! You can tell through how Anastasia thinks, that she is growing as a character and is growing to be more self aware of herself and her sexuality. This book embraces sex in a new way and also goes through how a relationship works. Very good read. Very enticing. Very seductive.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I have to admit that I was really skeptical when Green day announced that they would be releasing three albums in short succession.  I was wrong to worry.  This is Green Day as you know and love them.  Whether you're primarily a fan of Dookie or American Idiot, it doesn't matter.  This is Green Day in very fine form.  If you're a fan, this is a must have.

Has pop music degenerated to the point that people are critical when all the songs on an album don't sound the same?  Apparently so.<br /><br />If you believe that there's more to music than Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, then check this out.  It pays huge rewards after a few listens.
0061969664|5.0|Bernard Cornwell must be known to many even if not from his books but from the book inspired TV show \\"Sharp\\" , I have read all of them too.<br /><br />Death of Kings is the 6th novel in his 'The Making of England' series the previous books being:<br /><br />The Last Kingdom<br />The Pale Horseman<br />The Lords of the North<br />Sword Song<br />The Burning Land<br /><br />They tell the story of Alfred the Great the King with a vision to unite England into one country under the English. It doesn't matter today what your own providence is, particularly at this time when some Scots are attempting to reclaim their nation for themselves away from the English; these are tales of a beginning, tales of honour and glory, tales of battle and honour and tales of men dying in bloody battlefields terrified of the oncoming shield walls but bravely standing, fighting and dying for the birth of their Country and their King.<br /><br />'Go, go!'  Broga had charged two men.  One swung his sword at Broga's mouth, but he was trained well and reared up, hooves flailing, and the man ducked away.  I clung to him, waited until he came down and brought Serpent-Breath hard down onto the second man's head, splitting helmet and skull.  I heard a scream and saw that Broga had bitten of the first man's face.  I spurred on.  Dogs were howling, children screaming, and Serpent-Breath was feeding.'<br /><br />These are the tales as told by Uhtred of Babbenburg a Pagan from Northumbria who is brought up to despise Wessex, Mercia, The Danes and anyone else not from Northumbria but who ends up becoming Alfred's Sword and Shield against the Danes.<br /><br />The tale starts in the Last Kingdom when Uhtred is a boy in Babbenburg and we follow him through the years to this book and Alfred's death and his succession by Edward.  The books are based on real events and so not only are we getting an exciting tale of our first Great King and the Birth of England  but we are getting a master class in storytelling.<br /><br />Uhtred, on the face of it, has a miserable life, constantly fighting for his life and so, has to be that much better at taking life than his contemporaries, and he should be and is, a foul tempered man at times. But he is not always like that and all of the books are sprinkled with his really funny humour.<br /><br />Cornwell's writing through all his books improves and becomes better with each new book. The stories flow along; like soldiers marching along a Roman road without deviation, the prose is sharp and precise.  You do tend to stumble a little at the pronunciations of the original place names he uses, but that is not a criticism as they give added authenticity to the story and the books do not suffer for that.<br /><br />While this series of novels is telling us of the 'Making of England' they are stories of the birth of Uhtred, following his life's, his loves, his losses of the women he loved, and his ongoing fight to reconcile his Pagan beliefs with that of giving his oath to a Christian King and then to keeping that King and his successors on the throne while trying to find his way back to and reclaiming Babbenburg in the north.<br /><br />These stories are truly engaging and exciting reads and I can't recommend them enough.<br /><br />As I have all of the previous books in the series in hardback I continued in that theme with this one; and it was good to get back to holding a 'book' again (although I have to confess it did feel a bit unwieldy to begin with)<br /><br />Editing for Kindle:<br />Reading Enjoyment: 5out of 5<br />Plot: 5 out of 5<br />Overall Rating: 5 out of 5<br />Chapters: 13<br />Page length: 330 story, 5 Historical note

B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I bought this book for my Kindle based only on the reviews I read. I stopped reading Mr. Kings books around the time the Gunslinger series came out. I read all of his books before then and enjoyed ever one of them. But it got to a point where Mr. King would take you down a street and describe every building and alley and it wasn't necessary for the story, so I stopped reading him till now.<br />I'm glad I followed the recommendations, this is really an “old“ Stephen King book and worth the money and time.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|Finally a summary of what went wrong and what to do about it. Everyone should read this book. Buy it now.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great popcorn action movie. Kind of cheesy in some parts but non stop action. No real low points. It's a movie you can watch multiple times.
0783240236|5.0|There are a lot of birds in this movie; it seems appropriate for bird lovers. There is also a hot chick and a guy who wears pretty cool scarves, although scarves are not my thing as I have a warm neck. It's possible that it's a genetic mutation, as I see less people wearing scarves today, than in years past.
1451620829|5.0|I purchased \\"Makeup to Breakup\\" with the same expectation in which I've purchased so many other Kiss related products over the years - the expectation of being entertained. And in that context, Peter Criss delivers in spades. I don't personally have a dog in the ongoing (and likely never-ending) intra band Kiss fight, so I was just hoping to get a compelling and riveting story - my $27 worth. And I did.<br /><br />Kiss is an iconic rock band with an outrageous, forty-year rollercoaster history that involves a cast of colorful, larger than life characters. Hence, I suspect that there is a certain element of truth and embellishment in each of the members' biographies. Given his willingness to frequently throw himself under the bus (along with so many others), I found Criss' accounts to be reasonably credible, although he does recall some real whoppers. His stories are told with candor and wit in a conversational, no-nonsense style. But inspite of the often crass language used, Criss exceeded my expectations, keeping me highly entertained throughout.<br /><br />-Christopher Long
B009VB97EY|3.0|After watching \\"Magic Mike\\" last night, I'm very surprised at all the good reviews it received from critics (80% on Rotten Tomatoes.)  What I watched was a film that felt too long at 1 hour, 50 minutes and that didn't have much going for it aside from the novelty of watching male actors perform strip routines.  Channing Tatum had a good performance.  He's much better suited to comedy like [[ASIN:B003Y5H5BA 21 Jump Street (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]], but as Magic Mike, his \\"blankness\\" fits his character.  And he's certainly fun to watch when he dances.  Alex Pettyfer, on the other hand, co-starring as Magic Mike's stripper protege, appears to just be a bad actor; he seemed either scared or bored throughout the film, and he's very uninteresting to watch.  The real surprise was Matthew McConaughey, an actor whom I generally find to be insufferable.  He plays his character the same as he has played every character throughout his career, and this was the first time I've ever felt his method of acting actually fits his role.  The lead actress is played by Cody Horn, and let's just say that she makes Kristen Stewart look Oscar caliber.  Horn's acting consists of clenching her jaw and glaring silently.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed the film more if it focused on the campy angle.  Instead, the filmmakers attempted to add gravitas by focusing on a major drug storyline that quickly became tiresome.  A request to the filmmakers in the event of a sequel: fewer drugs, more dancing!
B005PMNBNG|4.0|Several of the songs, especially \\"Outro\\", are excellent. The rest aren't particularly enjoyable to me. I won't say I regret buying the album, but I do only listen to a fraction of it now. That's probably true of most albums by most artists, though.

It's fast paced and something you can get through quickly enough to not take over your life.<br /><br />It's nice to get off amazon as well as opposed to attempting to download in places with low internet connection.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Sorry about that title. Couldn't help myself. This is a really wonderful movie. We saw it in the theatre, and we have it watch again and again at home. This is a great round-up of the various character movies leading up to this one. A fine summary and very much in keeping with the characters. I hope the next generation who did not get to see these in comic books will appreciate what they have in the movie. And buying it from Amazon helped even more, because they kept the order on file for us and actually gave us a slight reduction in price when it finally shipped. Well done Amazon!! Thank you from a very satisfied customer.

1400067820|5.0|It is going to be difficult to compress the wisdom and knowledge of this book into a reasonable sized book review but I will attempt to this feat.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Mr. Taleb's other two books \\"The Black Swan\\" or \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" then that is good, this book will be easier to understand building on top of his previous books. He advises that this is his his primary work and the other two books can be used as appendixes to this book.<br /><br />This book explains that in this world of systems, ideas, financial instruments, financial institutions, people, governments, and economies that they all full under three categories. All things are either fragile, robust, or anti-fragile. The author spends a lot of time to explain that robust is not the opposite of fragile. Things that are fragile are easily broken from disorder, things that are robust hold up well in most circumstances and are not easily broken, but things that are anti-fragile benefit from disorder and grow stronger from adversity.<br /><br />This is a whole new lens to see the world through and Mr. Taleb goes on to classify and explain this in all areas of life through very clever essays that explain what he has learned in his life as both a financial trader for 20 years and in the world of academia. The book bursts through to confirm many of my long held beliefs and gives me a vocabulary to now express my beliefs more clearly.<br /><br />Things that are asymmetric and has more upside than downside from random events or sudden shocks is anti-fragile. While things that are fragile eventually break in time consider that if you can suffer limited harm, and are anti-fragile to small errors, time brings the kind of errors or reverse errors that end up benefiting you. Entrepreneurs are anti-fragile, to them mistakes are lessons not defeat. Anti-fragile entrepreneurs are able to come back from even bankruptcy to become millionaires. While many upper middle class employees are fragile, their entire identity and financial stability are wrapped up in their job and career, lay offs many times leave them dazed and confused and without another job they are broken quickly. While many that make lower wages working in the retail industry, restaurants, and blue collar jobs are robust and able to quickly go find a job when needed that so few even want with no pain to their own self worth.<br /><br />Federal Governments are fragile, small mistakes can cause huge consequences due to the size and scope of influence they disperse. Executive careers are fragile, one big mistake and a career can be ruined. The main purpose of the book is for the reader to come away with a complete understanding of the triad of exposure so they can put things in the right category and lead to a much better understanding of the world.<br /><br />Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them and think principles are domain dependent, they are not.<br /><br />Mr. Taleb wastes no time with giving out his jabs against what he calls the new class of inverse heroes, bureaucrats, bankers, name droppers, and academics with too much power, and no real downside and accountability. They game the system while citizens pay the price. He goes on early in the book to bemoan and explain that at no point in history have so many non-risk-takers, those with no personal exposure, exerted so much control. Amen, to that!<br />He observes their amazing ability to have anti-fragility at the expense of the fragility of others. Think big bank bailouts, lucrative government pensions and benefits, using government money to take care of their political donors through bills written for the lobbyists not the citizens, and all of this paid for by taxing the producers and inflating away the value of currencies through monetary policies.<br /><br />I have still not even scratched the surface of this amazing book on the nature of how things really are. This book isfood for the mind and is one of those books that you will never be the same again after you read it. It makes you think and see the world through a more focused lens.food for the mind and is one of those books that you will never be the same again after you read it.

B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is perfection. I couldn't imagine not being blown away by how brilliant this is. They deserve all the success and critical acclaim that comes their way.
1439152802|4.0|I initially was caught into the plot by this skilled author when she set up the characters in WWII England and present day 2011.  She moved the reader back and forth giving us a tidbit of significant incidents without giving us the details of the entire event.  She used this device to craft a complicated story but  one with potential intrigue loaded with love, remorse, survival, and the edges of sexual tension.<br /><br />Dorothy, the main character, is the mother of four girls and one son.  It is 2011 and she is dying and beloved by her children who have memories of a happy, fun-loving mother who introduced them to fantasies mixed with traditions.  The oldest daughter, Laurel, is a famous actress, who delves into her mother's past to uncover her secrets and ultimately solve a remarkable mystery of her mother's life.  Laurel witnessed a murder as an impressionable sixteen year old from her childhood tree house.<br /><br />Never forgetting this murder, Laurel unravels the background of this deadly act through three characters in war-torn London, Jimmy, Vivien and Dorothy.  Through their entwined lives, Morton weaves a tale of secrets, passion and consequences.  Deception is the main theme, which drives the story to its denouement; Morton ties it all together and keeps the reader going to the very last chapter.<br /><br />I liked the book and respected Morton's ability to omit specific parts of incidents as the story unfolds.  The most striking disconnect is of flippant Dorothy of 1938-1941 and the Dorothy who is a content mother who did not lead or need a glamorous live.  This disconnect is the revelation of the story and Morton brilliantly creates a powerful narrative.  As much as I admired the intricate plot, I believed it persisted too long.  The length of the book could have been cut by 75-100 pages and provided the same impact.  The longer it went on, the easier it was for me to decipher the mystery and the details became tiresome.

B008AX18Y6|5.0|Rushdie, writing of himself in the third person, offers a huge and rich tale of the weirdness of his years under protection. His struggle to lead the normal life of a (hardly faultless) man despite the threat and his struggle to defend his “Satanic Verses“ are at the center of this book.<br /><br />As expected in a work of this size, it loses steam a couple of times but invariably picks it up again. While one shouldn't expect an in depth and objective analysis of the situation, the book provides an insight into Rushdie‘s life inside the cage.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed watcing the visual effects. I wish that the plot was more original though, I could not help noticing the simularities to ALIEN movies. Overhaul, the movie is good but not suprising.
0756405890|5.0|I picked up The Name of The Wind like I pick up all books -- in the store, opened it up, browsed several random pages in various spots....and unlike most such browsing, this led me to actually SIT DOWN on the floor of the store and start reading. It is marvelously written, with English at a delightful adult level, and so well-constructed in plot and pacing that I could hardly put it down. I've just found The Wise Man's Fear and am enjoying that just as much. It is seldom that I find a book like a gourmet meal---each chapter a different course to be enjoyed fully, but consumed with a deep desire to reach the next chapter and follow the story. Having read nearly every fantasy and science fiction book I could lay my hands on in my 60 years (including those that predate me from Edgar Rice Burroughs and Conan Doyle),I have a lot to compare this series against. I recommend it whole-heartedly--it is wonderful.

B009KHCT94|4.0|\\"Iron Sky\\" is a fun parody once one can get pass the idea that the whole premise is absolutely ludicrous.  Don't worry about how these folks could have possibly lived on the moon for over fifty years. They seem to have space travel down so perhaps they had freight ships providing them supplies all those years. The future President of the U.S.A. and her campaign for re-election is a hoot although it could also be a cautionary tale.  Enjoy the movie for the comic book visuals and over the top caricatures.

B009KHDT0C|2.0|\\"Dark Shadows\\" was a soap opera back in the late 1960's whose characters had skeletons in their closet, literally. The original show had one of the first sympathetic portrayals of a vampire who wasn't all bad.  The movie had promise with the campy acting, good atmosphere background music, and nice visuals. BUT, the characters were not treated well - the witch became a Superman arch-villain, the doctor (my favorite from the original TV show) was treated shabbily and opportunities for a real plot were just wasted.  Changes from the original storyline didn't make sense and the ending of the movie was utterly forgettable. The filmmakers could have had a lot of fun with Barnabas' angst in not wanting to kill people and the whole haunted, dysfunctional family.  Too bad, if they had done it right, they could have made more movies starring the Collins Family.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I rented this thinking....this may be a big waste of time. Oh so wrong. Well written, good cast choice, but Hit Girl is a certified, well, hit. I had no idea this movie would be so funny. Now, I own it. Too bad that the sequel was not done while the Hit Girl charecter was still about as young. I read yesterday it is finally in production. Not sure who is in it except for Jim Carrey, and that alone will be reason enough to skip it. Too bad.

1616614609|5.0|This is the best game I have played in almost 2 years! Netrunner is an asynchronous card game that pits 2 players against each other. One as the Corporation and the other as the Agenda. Each player has their own decks and each deck is composed of different cards. What makes this game so much fun is how each side plays. Both players are trying to score cards known as Agendas, these cards give you points, and if you collect enough Agendas to give you 7 or more points you win. However, Agendas are found only in the Corporation's deck. The Corp. will install Agendas on Remote Servers (face down) and the runner will have to run on those servers in order to steal those Agendas. However, the Corp. has ICE to protect those servers as well as Assets which could help the Corporation's engine or simply be a trap for the runner. Because the Corp. plays all their card initially face down this allows the Corp. to bluff and creates tension for the runner because the runner isn't sure what some of the ICE could be as well as what is installed on the remote server. The runner can also attack the Corp.'s deck (R&D) as well as the Corp's hand (HQ). This game has so much going for it. A lot of fun to play. A game I highly recommend.
1439152802|2.0|I was so eager to read this book and once I did, I felt very let down.<br /><br />I have read all of Kate Morton's other books and I adore them.  But this book left me wanting to call the author and ask what happened?  It seemed, with all the back and forth between past and present key character development was left behind.  And that's just sad because this book has bones of something great.<br /><br />The moments when this book is good it is 5-star, but the other 50% of the book not so much.  My guess is, to create the twist at the end Morton felt it was necessary to build in all the extra pages with that 50%.  To be honest, I started skimming through that 50%.  I spent my time enjoying the main characters!  I would put Laurel & Gerry in the 50%.  In my opinion the book could have done without them.  Dolly, Mrs G, Vivian, Jimmy, the treehouse & the orphanage --- The best story lines!  Even that tattered white fur coat had a better story line than that the 50%!<br /><br />I'm still a fan of Kate Morton.  But your money is better spent reading another book of hers.  Especially The House at Riverton - That's a great read.  :  )

I took it with me everywhere.  I was honked at so many times at red lights that I would pull over in parking lots to read another chapter.  I cried buckets of tears when the last page was read.  I did not want this story to end.  It IS that good!<br /><br />This story reads like a fantastic magical theme park where you can live forever to escape reality.  A real life dream of running off to the circus and landing in a luxurious mystery.  The detailed descriptions of the sights you can experience under the tents of the circus are unreal.  Breathtaking ...<br /><br />This is a book I will read over & over.  Thank you Erin!

B000J1AGQI|5.0|Having previously read the book \\"We were Soldiers Once...And Young\\" twice, I missed the movie in theaters, but finally bought the DVD. The story is solid. The fictional liberties it takes move the story along very nicely and having the wives on the homefront as a major part of the story was inspired. In the end, the story is less about the violence of the action that about the brotherhood shown by the men and the sisterhood displayed by their wives. Highly impressive are the measures taken by the director to get the look, feel, and sound of combat just right. It is a strange phenomenon, but after I got to Vietnam in late 1966 as a young naval officer, when I look back on my rather limited experience in artillery exchanges was that I don't remember the sound, although it must have been tremendous (I spent twenty of my forty months there on the gunline, mostly in Quang Tri province (I Corps)). What has stayed with me is the visual aspect of combat. I wonder if not a few of these brave soldiers had the same experience. The is a \\"keeper movie\\" with one proviso - there is an overwhelming sense of sadness that takes hold near the end of the battle. It is a shame that the movie could not do justice to the aftermath when Westmorland, and others in American higher levels of authority, learned the wrong lessons and thought they could win the battle of attrition. Hal Moore made that clear in the book.

B009X5Q944|4.0|I am delighted that the 6th season of the BIG Bang has begun. Unfortunately, the first 3 episodes were the same 'ole' stuff-  Raj moaning about his loneliness and Penny aiming for nothing interesting in life. Thank goodness for Howard's hilarious space station adventures or I would've fallen asleep. This episode, 'The Holographic Excitation', finally displayed new humor (even a little growth)in all the characters.  Howard and Bernadette as Smurfs was to die for. I am still laughing.  As for Jim Parson's character, I am always amazed at the creativity surrounding his scripts as Sheldon.  A note to the writers - give Penny a little more character-dept this season!  She is getting repetitive and boring.  Can't wait to see what happens with the  Raj & Stewart 'bro-mance.'

B000O77SOK|5.0|The Practice is one of the best legal dramas I have watched, and I'm furious that all of the seasons have not been released on DVD (or onto Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, etc.). I watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu (or maybe Netflix?), and that was a few years ago. Since then, I keep checking to see if the rest of the seasons are available, and they're still not available. So frustrating. The actors on this series did an amazing job and won a ton of Emmys; I can't believe the idiots at Medium Rare Entertainment who bought the rights to The Practice are going to let all that footage gather dust and not see the light of day again. For the love of god, PLEASE release the rest of the seasons in the series!<br /><br />The show is filled with interesting cases, and we get to know the attorneys at the firm very well, including their personal lives. Watching this show made me really glad I'm not an attorney! They always seem to be dealing with moral dilemmas on this show. I would really like to watch the rest of the episodes. That would keep me entertained for a long time! Never a dull episode.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. nice mixture but suddenly it won't even open. I've been trying for 3 days and it won't even try to open. don't know if anyone else has had this problem on the kindle fire.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book helps me in school and with many other thing.The other thing is that you can highlight words very easily. and thats really cool!I'm a 10 year old girl who likes her new kindle.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|My brother sent me the first of the Stephanie Plum books, and I'm now working on number nine. These books are well-written, easy to read, and very entertaining. You need to try at least one!
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I just discovered Mayer Hawthorne, when I was watching random episodes of Live at Daryl's House.  It was love at first sight & sound.  His voice is amazing...smooth, yet unique.  His style is quirky & off-beat, yet solidly based in classic Motown. The man knows how to groove.  I love how he writes his own songs, sings all the vocals & plays most of the instruments.  He's very talented.  A true musician.  I've been listening to this cd non-stop, ever since it arrived.
B0015FRC9Q|5.0|Genesis wasn't truly out their &#34;Progressive&#34; shadow, but the seeds of the &#34;Pop&#34; era was rearing with this &#34;perfect&#34; album.&#34;Duke&#34; features the hit songs &#34;Turn it On Again&#34;, &#34;Duchess&#34; and the US Top 20 single &#34;Misunderstanding&#34;.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat, it was a real mind bender.  I am still wondering if Ethan Burke tries again to escape.  The end was a surprise, I wish I could have read more...Maybe Blake Crouch will write a sequel to Pines...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm app. Being able to personalize the alarm sound with music is fantastic! I also like the snooze option features. I am a hard sleeper, so have lots of options/alarms is a must!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Waited and waited for the return if John Corey...and was not disappointed. A great read lanced with Mr. Corey's sarcasim.
1401322786|3.0|The book was fantastic, don't get me wrong. I loved the whole idea of Father time and the two main characters wanting too little and too much time. However, Sarah tended to blatantly piss me off because I felt she was a very frustrating and naive character. It got the point across but I thought she could of used a more convincing story. Overall Dor and Victor are perfect, I loved their stories.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|If you are a Batman comic book fan, there is a good chance you read Frank Millers \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", as it was a groundbreaking story of it's time. Bruce Timm (the creator of Batman: The Animated series) drew great inspirtation from this graphic novel, so it seemed obvious that he would adapt this story at some point. And now we finally have Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. So, being a huge fan of this story, did years of waiting for an adaptation pay off?<br /><br />Fortunately, the answer is yes! Although I liked it, my problem with the Batman: Year 1 film was the information being cramed into 1 film. But, making Dark Knight Returns 2 parts was a smart move. Every inch of the graphic novels first half is explored in this film, and I couldn't have asked for more.<br /><br />So, the story of Dark Knight Returns is identical to the comic. If you are NOT familiar with the comic, this is the synopsis: Batman retired after the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and 10 years later, Gotham is worse than ever. A new gang (called the Mutants) is almost in total control of Gotham, and the City is just as bad as it was in Bruce Waynes early years. After the dissaperance of a reabilitated Harvey Dent, the time has come, and Bruce Wayne must become Batman again, and take the mutants down, along with the aid of a new Robin. However, the reaperance of Batman will come at a price, as his return will awaken old enemies (who we will see in Part 2).<br /><br />THE POSITIVES:<br />-The animation is solid. Although the style isn't quite the same as the comic, the character designs are still almost identical to the source material. I was pleased with most of the animation.<br /><br />-The action was fantastic. Every peice of action from the comic is put on film, and then expanded upon.<br /><br />-The voice actors all do a good job. No one here is bad at all. Peter Weller isn't spectacular, but is still a good Batman.<br /><br />-Alot of credit here should be given toJay Olivia, the director. What can I say, he is extremely faithful to the source material, and his editing and directing are brilliant. They picked the perfect scene for the ending, which is a great cliffhanger that got me VERY excited for Part 2.<br /><br />-The pacing is great. It's easy to follow along, I never got bored, and I didn't want it to end when it did.<br /><br />THE NEGATIVES:<br />-Like I said, Peter Weller is a good Batman, and everyone else does a good job. However, lets not forget that they are all newcomers, and there are some lines of dialogue that seem, ackward, and other scenes where it sounds like they are reading their lines for the first time. But, there is room for improvement, so im glad they didn't do Part 1 and 2 at the same time.<br /><br />-Although the animation is great for most of the film, the opening seems bland. If you havn't seen the other DC animated films, you won't notice. But, if you have, then you probably know that they do a great job with their detail, and how they take their time with some scenes. However, with this film, some scenes just seem really bland, namely the opening. The animation improved over the course of the film, but the begining just didn't seem, finished. It was still great overall, but not in line with some of their other films at times. But again, there is room to improve in Part 2.<br /><br />-The only character who seemed to lack development is the new Robin, Carrie Kelley (yes, Robin IS a girl in this story, but a completely different character). But, I won't complain that much simply becaude she has just as much development as the comic. That was my only complaint about the comic, though. If there is one thing that I felt they could have expanded from comic to film, it would be her backstory.<br /><br />My complaints with the film are really just nitpicks though, I just had to list my problems (as few as they were). Overall, the Dark Knight Returns Part 1 is how you make a good, faithful adaptation. The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I need to be fair and judge both parts as one film. I need to wait for Part 2 to see if they did make a solid, true adaptation overall. But I have faith that they will :)

B008FSCNTK|1.0|This is by far her WORST album to date. This CD is a completely different style of her music. I would not even classify it in the same genre of her other works. My hopes are that her future albums do not mimic this one. If this is what can be expected of future albums, I am no longer a fan. Until then, I will hold out waiting to see what the next album brings. For now, I still love Diana as I hang on to the hope that in the future she will bring more flavors of her jazz roots.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not even close to the quality of the first book.  there was way too much up and down in this book.  in the same paragraph she hates him, loves him, wants to leave him and then wants to stay.  not impressed
B0073PPKNM|3.0|I thought her previous album, \\"My One & Only Thrill\\" was heads above this one. This album is not HORRIBLE but I enjoyed the last one much better.
1401324649|5.0|This book was chosen for our book club I I read it because I had to. But what a joy to read, I think if you get to be 100 then life has different consequences and to have little or none is a joy. Read this and no longer is old age a worry but something to look forward to. A must!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Can't wait for the third book. Didn't think I would like it as much as fifty shades, but I think the story was much better.
B005MHHREI|5.0|Highly informative, as well as frightening.  Readers will learn much about Mao that the American media has refused to cover over the decades.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a very good read with a lot of information on the life of a Seal, Would highly recommend the book to all even though it is very graphic in detail.

1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander, M.D., has been an academic neurosurgeon for the last twenty-five years, including fifteen years at the Brigham & Women's and the Children's Hospitals and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Dr. Eben Alexander's near-death experience is the most astounding I have read in my decades of reading and studying this phenomenon.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander brings a very special view to the spiritual realm due to his education and vocation in the medical world.  His combination of science and the spiritual is profound and believable.  Proof of Heaven is a compelling story of our future as we move from this life into the next dimension.  My only fear is that the scientific community will continue to ignore the spiritual element that governs this place we call the universe.  Hopefully, Dr. Alexander's persuasive and undeniable story will convince our skeptics to take a long, serious look at this arena.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the story within the story about his struggles with adoption and the captivating tale of despair and eventually fulfillment.  This story was forceful for me as I have a daughter struggling with the same issues.  I hope she can find peace as Dr. Alexander has done.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I hope you found the review/opinion helpful.<br /><br />Michael L. Gooch, SPHR - Author of Wingtips with Spurs, Lessons from the Ranch and Voodoo Fever.
B000WLIEKK|4.0|The first half is awesome. The second is still pretty good. Alter Bridge is consistently some of the best rock alternative out there.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|The fight scenes were really great, surprising and original, and the actress did a great job balancing rudeness and style. The choking scene with her in a night dress is memorable. Good, fun movie.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Awesome box set! Michael's performance was like no other. Bad25 is a treasure and I enjoyed the entire set!! The King of Pop is an understatement!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it is not the best but fun and you would see it looks like it is coping temple run but. like I said it is fun
0345802934|5.0|I didn't like the slow start or repetition in the prose, but Murakami very deftly wove something that plucked at something inside me--many things in my own childhood, it was as if he described an alternate reality the I might even have belonged to at some point. It may not be for everyone but this book was definitely for me.<br /><br />I've been a small fan of Murakami's for a while and if you are a big fan of surreal or magical realism fiction than you will probably love the book as much as I do.
B00932H1HG|4.0|This album is a great effort by our old friend AC. It's just so hard to top Merriweather Post Pavilion. This album has a totally different feel from any of their past stuff. It's definitely not for the worst. If you've been an AC fan for some time now definitely check it out. If you only came in on the last album you might not be so pleased.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I had planned on giving 4 stars. I went and created a new player to review the rules and explanations of the game. I had been playing for several days and had accumulated many bonuses and points but could not remember what all the bonuses did. Aftrer creating a new player I noticed that the timer was giving a lot less time than prior game.  I decided to go back to my first game and it no longer existed. A fun twist on the match game. Would suggest a little more explanation on the game. I had 17 hearts and am clueless what they are for. Maybe needs a tweak on the timer issue and not keeping all the players scores.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|Sounds very similar to the first album so if you liked that this will be great. If you're looking for something different don't look here.
B00992CF6W|4.0|please help I keep trying to downlaod it but it won't work I love this game and it's great. so try to get it if your kindle will let you
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />A very good movie, I thought, polemic ending or not.<br /><br />The movie is really depressing, you really feel the weight and unoforgiveness of that environment (wolves present or not).<br /><br />Acting is very good, and character development is good. What people want? That in series of highly dangerous events that occurs in the period ot two days maximum every character would be perfectly defined?<br /><br />I got sad with the death of each single character, something very unusual in recent movies.<br /><br />As for the supposed environmental flaws in the movie, can't talk about them (except for the scene where Ottawy falls into the freezing water and does not tries do dry himself. That was absurd. But, maybe, the final fight with the wolf came shortly after. Would that be time enough for him to freeze to death? I don't know).<br /><br />Maybe people who are rating this so low are confusing things. Maybe they are giving it one or two stars not because it's bad, but because it is indeed depressing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|it was a heart touching story that I will remember forever. its is the best book I have ever read.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This is a nice and an easy read.  The sum of my feeling about this book is that I  enjoyed it and I feel that I will try other Castle tales.<br />.
030758836X|1.0|As an educated, mature woman, I can say with confidence that ALL the characters in Flynn's Gone Grirl are GONE.  None of these characters mirrored the behavior of normal people.  Oh well, perhaps I should stay clear of Best Seller' lists.  My bad.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|when I try to go into the store it will close the entire app. they need to come out with an update to fix it.

B0047SF41G|4.0|This movie didn't disappoint even tho it could have been a little better in the story department. I would buy the blu-ray.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|Thought it would be fun,  but the levels were the same. Not worth the money. Not even if it was free.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I'm Thai and like the rest of Les Mis fans around the world, couldnt resist buying the soundtrack. Of all Les Mis CD's out there, this is without a doubt THE BEST VERSION!! If you're only gonna have 1 Les Mis cd, this is definitely the one to grab. I'm not saying that the other versions are bad, I'm just saying this version's got the best cast you could ever ask for. Don't think, get it now before its too late. Better yet, get a dvd of the concert as well. My all time fav songs from the album are, On my own (Lea Salonga is always gonna be remembered as the best Eponine. A lot of people seem to think her Eponine is too bitter. Personally,I think Eponine is supposed to be bitter. I like bitter Eponine a lot more than whiny Eponine), A Little Fall of Rain (Lea Salonga sang this song with such sweet and yet heartbreaking sadness and with Michale Ball, they'd set the level that nobody have reached or will ever reach), Master of the House (I cant seem to get enough of this song!! It's such a fun number to listen to), Do You Hear the People Sing, Bring Him Home (OMG! Cried so many times and still gonna. This is the best version of this song hands down!!) last but not least, One Day More (Gives me a chill everytime. Never fails to make me smile and cry at the same time. This version is WAY BETTER than the 25th anniversary version)<br />All in all, this is a must have cd for Les Mis fans out there. I bought 2 of this albums cause ive been listening to the songs so much that the discs are starting to wear out on me. I put all the songs on my iphone and ipad but for some reason having a spare one makes me feel much more at ease. I'm weird like that but come on people, this is the best les mis soundtrack, I'm sure a lot of other fans do the same :)
0307951529|5.0|This book is incredible I love it! Its everything I imagined that it would be. I recommend this to everyone looking to buy.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a very fun read.  If everyone could meet their soul mate, love would be like Eva's and Gideon's.  I am now reading the exciting 2nd book in the series.  I am hoping that the Crossfire series will continue.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|I am giving this book 2 stars only because for some reason, Rothfuss managed to trick me into thinking it was going to be good for about half the book, so there must be some imaginative concepts in here.  Shortly after that, I gave up reading it, when I realized the central theme is that the main character will always be better than everyone, and will always manage to come out on top, even when he errs horribly.  My friends tell me it only gets more like that toward the end, and into the second book.  (They loved it.)  There's nothing to say that hasn't already been said here.  It's garbage.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I was blown away by this movie.  I thought I would give it a try, but it was a powerhouse all the way through.  The actors seemed like real kids and their characters reflected their decisions.  No loose ends, and a surprise behind every turn.  The train wreck was so intense I had to pause it afterwards!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie. Very entertaining for the entire family. I look forward to the sequel as I am sure the family will love it!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|great movie couldn't wait to own it.cant wait  for the avangers two and thor 2 and iron man 3 to come out
0871164566|5.0|This is a very good book and deserves a place in a jewelry making library.<br /><br />I've made the Traditional Cross frame with square wire and it worked out well. Then I made the frame with 16-gauge round wire, it also worked out well.<br /><br />The only comment I would make about that frame is, leave excess wire on each end of the 10\\" wire. The instructions for the bail make the pendant look sloppy, and another bail works a lot better. In addition, when doing the wrapping for the bail, there is a tendency to distort the frame.<br /><br />The frame will probably not be perfect, but that adds to its charm!<br /><br />Also, don't try to \\"adjust\\" the frame, when you are finished, do the adjusting as you go.<br /><br />The idea of markings on paper is a great idea, and saves time for future cross pendants!<br /><br />I haven't filled in the pendant yet, but that will be the fun part.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to making other frames from the book, but I must remember to leave extra wire for the bail.<br /><br />I couldn't find any contact info for the author. It would have been nice if some hints were given on how to keep copper clean when it is combined with semi-precious gem stones. Instructions would be nice, if there is an answer to that problem!<br /><br />An index would have been nice.<br /><br />If you like to make frames, this is the book for you!

B005L38QK2|3.0|This mouse has most of the pluses coming using the Steelseries Xai mouse.  I am especially interested because this Steelseries mouse retains the soft rubberized coating around the mouse but with a better/smoother scroll wheel compared to Xai, which is what I was looking for.  It's just less \\"clunky.\\"<br /><br />The pluses that are inherited from Xai:<br />- very smooth tracking and precise movement<br />- 4 side buttons that are customizable, including macros (using driver software)<br />- Can be comfortably used for both claw/palm grip<br />- Has rubber coating that feels very nice and comfortable to the touch<br />- Good quality teflon feet for gliding<br /><br />THE major flaw that made me return this mouse has to be the sound of the mouse click.  It is WAY too loud, especially comparing with Xai.  So if you are someone who needs to use it in a quiet room, or is sensitive to noise... stay away.  It is just too bad...<br /><br />Also this mouse does NOT have on-board memory so the Steelseries Engine software has to be running and configured on each computer you want to use the mouse with.<br /><br />Note: if your mouse is stuck on \\"red\\" with an LCD, you can run the \\"SSEfix.exe\\" executable inside the Steelseries Engine directory to try to fix the firmware on the mouse.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are the best musical group I have come across. They never cease to amaze me. The feeling in each song is so real, so beautiful, I cant think of an accurate way to describe it. I can work to their songs and laugh at their songs, and even cry at their songs. They are really amazing and I cant wait till the next CD comes out.<br /><br />The Piano Guys make me happy!!!!
B007SSZDJA|5.0|Love every song on this CD!  Listen to it often while driving in my car. I am looking forward to season 2 of the show!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I thought I had read all if not most of Michael Connelly's books. I missed The Last Coyote however. It was a good lesson that older novels are as good as newer ones and this book is a good example. I was lucky to have found it.
B001K3ENEA|4.0|I purchased a pair for 30+ $ which is great value for money.<br />Sound quality is solid, not full range but close enough, but of course you get what you paid for. The structure feels very plastic but the ear pads are very comfortable. They are quite light which is great for walks.<br />Recommend it fully for people who want quality sound but can't afford it. It's a great alternative.<br />That is all.
B006VGGAC4|3.0|Too long. Rambled on in certain areas like his childhood and the making of his movies. Ironic that he spent so much detail in movies and bodybuilding but just scratched the surface in his affairs.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Full of surprises, per usual, but still a transition book as 'Crows' had been.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|It is an easy read it only took me two days but to be honest, it is not that great of a book.  One of the messages is that we should live the moment but I couldn‘t really see how it aplied to the main character. Over all, it is a cool book but  not the best book ever.

B008JIFJ4W|4.0|The juxtaposition of heady and dark lyrical content against the catchy and lively hooks makes this a deceptively engaging and rewarding listen. This is a collection of songs which confoundes expectations and proves that sometimes beauty and pathos can dance well together in the right circumstances. The thrill and reward here is that there is much more going on than what meets the ears on first impression, quite a lot of more in fact: anguish, brain and heartache on closer inspection. Hopefully the creation has helped exercise the artist's demons and long may he prevail to continue to offer such well orchestrated dichotomies.
B000031XBQ|5.0|So my gf loves Abba, and this was one of the few items that she didn't have, gave it to her as a birthday surprise, she loved it.

0446580848|4.0|DeMille brings back John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield for another mission placing them in great danger from terrorists. This time, the two are pressured into accepting an assignment in Yemen to track down a terrorist called The Panther who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the bombing of the USS Cole. John quickly realizes that the basic strategy for the assignment is to use Kate and him as bait to lure The Panther out of hiding.  There is every reason to believe that this will work because, in their last mission (see the book The Lion) they were responsible for the death of one of the Panther's associates. He also realizes that there are good reasons for the FBI and CIA to not much care if neither of them survive. Readers who have been faithfully following the series will understand all of this from the previous books but even people who have not read any of the previous books will be given enough of the back story to understand why John and Kate were chosen and why, if they should happen to be killed there would be some on the US side would not mourn the loss.<br /><br /> John Corey is a smart mouthed former New York City cop who is a bit of a loose cannon in the field. He seems to view rules and regulations as more of proposed guidelines than a hard and fast code of behavior. Readers can't help but like the guy and cheer on his antics, but his superiors only tolerate them because of his success rate. Why Kate puts up with the ever running smart mouthed dialog is, quite frankly, beyond me. While in the previous books his sarcastic comments seemed to fit the situation, in this book they got a bit tiresome often sounding more like a junior high's boys' locker room than adults on a mission. I suppose some of it was added for comic relief and it is possible that men in this situation might speak this way, but for me as a reader I wanted to scream at John, \\"enough already!\\"<br /><br />For a book weighing in at over 600 pages, the plot is remarkably straight forward. There are some twists, but for the most part, readers are with John and Kate from the time they leave New York until their mission is over. Much of the book is used to get readers familiar with Yemen, both its landscape and its people along with the political situation in the country. I found this to be nearly as interesting as the plot of the book. I have no idea if the way the war on terrorism over seas is described in the book is accurate or not, but my feeling is that the author has a fairly good grasp of the details. This part was both comical and also a bit scary at times. The use of drones was heavily discussed and I found that especially interesting.<br /><br />Of course readers of the DeMille series will be anxious to get their hands on The Panther, but not having read any of the previous books should not keep others who enjoy books set around military operations, books involving the CIA or people who like to read books with foreign settings from picking this book up. I'm fairly confident that each reader will find something to like in it.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Many of the reviews bring up the faults in this movie. And Many go way too much in detail to draw my interest. There are many problems created by the movie that are in conflict with what the original series presented, but you'd have to watch the movie to understand this. I'm not willing to go into details of everything I found strange because this is only one person's view. Even if the majority of trekkers were to agree on a failing, this failing could easily be of no concern to you.<br /><br />I'm fascinated by Star Trek. The failings of this movie grounded me but the plot, the construction, the effects and story line picked me up and made me ethusiastic about the movie. I've watched it many times, unusual for me, and I've never doubted about watching it again. It's a movie where each viewing reveals a little more information and I notice things not noticed before.<br /><br />I enthusiastically believe you'd enjoy this movie. I'm also bummed by saying that you need to see this movie as itself, without judging it against the series, in order to truly enjoy a very well constructed story line. But this is only my opinion.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Great book . Can't wait till to read the next one!  However Eva is too dramatic.....jealous.a bit similar ti fifty shades however a great read ....
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|\\"The Way of Kings\\" seemed a little intimidating to me at first, not only because of the sheer size of it (over 1000 pages), but also because the new terminology, the complicated magic system, and world-building made it a bit difficult for me to relate to.  I almost gave up reading it a few times, not knowing if I wanted to commit the time and effort to it.  But after several days and chapters into it, I became completely obsessed. This book went with me everywhere and I stole every second I could to read it, and when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.  This new world, these amazing characters, and the incredible story that Sanderson has created is so well-crafted and compelling that I knew I was reading something very special - a true masterpiece.  There were many times in the novel when I could feel the hair standing up on the back of my neck from pure excitement and anticipation.<br /><br />In the past, I have not really been a big fan of Sanderson because his writing tends to focus more on cool new magic systems while I tend to prefer deep, character-driven fantasy stories. However, in The Way of Kings, Sanderson seemed to find a perfect balance between the two. For me, \\"The Way of Kings\\" is by far the best thing I've read from this author.<br /><br />I just want to say to anyone who is debating whether or not to read this book, READ IT!! And to anyone who is thinking about giving up on it too soon, DON'T!!!  You will NOT regret it.  As someone else already said, the only loss will be your own if you don't read it.  The Way of Kings is one of the most epic, exciting, and memorable stories I've read in a long time and I actually found myself wishing the book were longer!  I simply cannot wait for the next book of this series to come out! WOW!!!est thing I've read from this author.  Is it as good as \\"The Game of Thrones\\"?  In my opinion, NO WAY (is ANYTHING really?).  Is it the most exciting thing I've read in a long while?  Definitely YES!  Is it worth a 5-star rating?  YES!

B00447L4JG|4.0|I've loved this movie since my parents took me to see it in theaters almost 20 years ago. This is probably my 5th copy (only the 2nd on DVD) since I tend to wear them out.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed to find that this version does not include the short films that previously sold versions have (the older, live action version of \\"Frankenweenie\\" and Burton's animation, \\"Vincent\\"). However, with the new release of the prior film, I suppose I could forgive their absence.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I have been slowly learning the hobby of home audio the past few years, and I must say, these headphones are on the top three best things I have done.  first, redoing my speaker crossovers with poly caps, second, buying a reasonable turntable, and lastly, these headphones.  wow. These headphones literally blow me away.  fully worth every penny.  Each day I use them I love them more and more.  I was a bit taken aback the first day I had them, but like most things worth my time, they grew on me.  Possibly because of the break in period, or possibly because I didn't fully understand what I had in front of me.  Get these you you will never look at music or the equipment associated with it the same ever again.  In summary... oh my god....

B005H9B44A|4.0|Loved the movie critics be damned.  And it was Kat Denning who made it really enjoyable for me.  While the movie had a lot of logic disconnects, Kat Dennings role was so funny it made me laugh.  Even now as I think about her lines in the movie I laugh.  The CGI was pretty good and the action execellent but anything Natalie Portman appears in is worth watching.  I bought it and it is stored on the cloud and I have a real problem with that.  The movie stops many times half way through the film and I have replayed it several times and the glitches seem to be same.  These glitches make me unwilling to use this way of buying or watching if Amazon can not choose clean recordings to put on the cloud.
0399157565|5.0|The Bone Bed is one of Patricia Cornwell's best. Her literary style has evolved to one unseen in other crime writers and has nothing to fear when being compared to those authors viewed as &#34;high literary&#34; writers. It is the 20th Scarpetta and while I stopped reading many other novelists who write in series I am not only still with her, no, I can hardly wait for No. 21.<br /><br />The reasons are simple: Patricia Cornwell never repeats herself. Like in all of her mysteries the plot is unique, unforseeable and full of unpredictable and surprising twists and turns, so that I never encounter a moment in which I end up thinking &#34;ah, I knew&#34;. She holds me in suspense, takes me into abysses and teaches me more than one thing or two in each of her novels. The Bone Bed is no exception to that rule.<br /><br />Her heroine Kay Scarpetta has further mellowed, a tendency that stared in Port Mortuary and was carried on in Red Mist, what makes her all the more likeable. She is not perfect, what makes it so easy to feel as if she is family than more than 20 years now. And in The Bone Bed we get more of her inner thoughs, her fears than before. To me this makes me feel closer to Scarpetta than before. When I started reading her in the early years I was always a bit intimidated by that strong and powerful woman. Now, I feel more on a level with her and that is a very comfortable place. I wouldn't want to miss her from my life.<br /><br />The Bone Bed ends with a surprise. For those who follow the characters since long, I think it will feel like for me. I am all smiles and happy for Lucy and Marino. I very much look forward to Scarpetta No. 21 as I feel this will be a wonderful book as some long standing issues seem to find a very happy ending.<br /><br />All in all a wonderful book. It can certainly be read even if you've never encountered Kay Scarpetta before, but then it will make you want all other 19.<br /><br />A masterpiece.
0316228532|1.0|I ordered the book based upon by reading all the Harry potter series.  However from the begining of the book I found it trying reading.  It did not keep my attention nor did I want to turn the next page to see what was coming.  I did not finish the book.

B003ASLJS6|4.0|Clint Eastwood stars as a Preacher who comes to the aid of a group of panhandlers in the fictional town of Lahood, California, in the 1880s. It's a sort of `Dirty Harry goes prospecting' story. The small group of gold miners are threatened by Coy Lahood (Richard Dysart) and his gun-toting thugs as he wants to take over their claims too. Coy runs the local town and does his gold mining with heavy duty hydraulic equipment. The Preacher befriends Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty), who leads the small group of panhandlers, when he is set upon by Coy's men as he visits town for supplies. Hull lives with Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgrass) and her daughter Megan (Sydney Penny) and they extend hospitality to the Preacher for saving Hull. Coy send his son Josh (Christopher Penn) to try to get the panhandlers to leave and Josh is accompanied by Club (Richard Kiel) who breaks a rock the panhandlers are struggling to move with just one blow.  The showdown between the two groups of miners eventually occurs and the Preacher saves the panhandlers, though Hull is given the chance to repay his debt to the Preacher. The film was produced and directed by Clint Eastwood.

B009NPKTN6|3.0|Simply put, A for effort, A for cast, A for music, C for acting, F for substance.  So you have a C+ as your final tally.<br /><br />Look, the catchy medley's and throwbacks to my generation of rock and roll was awesome.  Reminiscing over the tunes with my wife brought on a sense of euphoric nostalgia at a few sporadic moments.  But, let's get to the meat and potatoes.  It felt extremely forced, pretentious and downright (for the lack of a better term) cheesy at times.<br /><br />When you are going to transform a popular musical into a motion picture (which in most instances, has not worked well) you are going to have to put some zing behind the screenplay, besides \\"just\\" a stellar cast.<br /><br />It was obvious, the overall concept was thought out based off of the music (again, that was great) and star appeal (great cast, not so great acting).  But it attempted to lean on star appeal alone and that cannot be the defining success of a movie.  People are looking for something with more emotion and depth.  After the first half hour or so, it was very apparent that this missed that mark.<br /><br />I really consider this a take it or leave.  If you have no options, this is a great time waster, just for the music alone.<br /><br />The ending credits left me with that nagging feeling that the director, screenplay writer, and producers could have done a better job building this city of rock and roll.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|This movie is a classic mostly for the time period it is set in and the way it is portrayed in this film. It may not be or have been Oscar-worthy but it is the 300 of it's time

B009IKQAAM|3.0|As other reviewers have said, this is an excellent collection. However, be careful when you order the digital version--sound is fine, but the track names provided--as you can see from the track list on the webpage for the MP3--are only of the sections of the works and do not show the work itself. Not sure how anyone could have thought that was an adequate idea. So, I've had to spend a lot of time hunting Wikipedia and other places to match the works with the sections. The artist information is also incomplete. A .pdf of the booklet that comes with the set would have been great.

B0086213XW|2.0|From pretty much the start of this movie I wanted to turn it off.  Not long after my husband said this is really lame. The dialogue was so completely unrealistic and forced and the main character was annoying.  The interactions between both the husband and wife and the wife and the new guy were so unnatural and not what would really happen. The public pool shower scene put the nail in the coffin for us and we shut it off there.  You are just watching and bam you are blasted with a bunch of full frontal beaver shots and not just for a second, but extended. It has no place at all in a movie like this and it pretty much represents the poor, juvenile quality of the rest of the movie.

DO NOT REMASTER SABBATH OR TOUCH UP VAN GOH--OK  SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH...They most have wanted to pull out of the mirky recoring of VOL 4-  Probably using all resource of the best technogy of the time SABBATH did just that. This highly complex music had reached its peak with amazing results. The music the lyrics and the album art concept all are beyond  just beyond so so awsome..stays with you for ever..untouchable unforgetable songs.

B000002KIK|5.0|Finally i get to weigh in on this very contraversal Sabbath album. How can i rave about this album when..well have you seen \\"God bless Ozzy O\\" on cable? He says he hates his own recording and Bill Ward can't remember even making it..due to alcohol he claims. Wow where does that leave the fan the listener? Well like most i was put off by this album actually purchased in 1978..fresh with the previous records..obviously a different sound at the begining to the end i was dissapointed..but my musical mind had not grown as Sabbath obviously did if you really listen to the album..it IS SABBATH! a more mature sabbath but always with story telling in mind. Sabbath have always been a story telling and mental image type music.The first album was to play as a \\"Alan in wonderland' all gone wrong with meeting a witch and maybe demonic posesssion..like a horror move..getting their name From Boris Karloffs' BLACK SABBATH movie ..to me playing NIB out of context is wrong..its telling inside the story on the record  not the bands' ever love for Satan. But back to NEVER SAY DIE it may take many listens for you to hear the artistry of all the instrament and how they all come together with genious results..someone was at the helm and i am glad this album got made ..i love it.  ps  BUY WARNER BROS. DO NOT REMASTER SABBATH!!!!

B009HV2JT8|1.0|This film is not for those looking for scares or thrills.  There are a few interesting bits but for the most part it's a limp story with a bunch of unknowns who lack screen presence.  The vamps are buffoonish, clownish ogres who lack the syle and gravitas of Coppola's Dracula or Interview With The Vampire.  And it is long, so very long, each minute felt like an hour.  The movie drags, focusing too much on filling the screen with empty CGI and not enough on an engaging story.  I hope this marks the end of the atrociously written mash up books.<br /><br />Skip this dud and rent Timur Bekmambemtov's Wanted, Night Watch or Day Watch if you are looking for great thrills.
B00338QENI|3.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was really interesting.  I learned a lot about HeLa and about Henrietta's story.  I also understood the science because it was presented in layman's terms, which I really appreciate.  I did not mind the second half of the book as much as other people did, but it didn't necessarily add anything for me.  The family's story was incredibly sad and I was glad that Deborah was able to find some measure of peace.<br /><br />What bothered me was the implication that Henrietta would have been treated differently had she been White.  I am not so sure about that.  What happened to Henrietta was common practice in the 1950s so I did not respond favorably to the idea that medical science took advantage of her or that the scientists were opportunistic and greedy and saw HeLa as a way to make millions to the detriment of Henrietta's family.  Maybe they were and maybe they weren't.  I don't think we'll ever really know.  I have the feeling that Henrietta would have signed a consent form if asked and that she would probably not have understand what it really meant.  That is sad as well.<br /><br />Overall, I do recommend the book.  It is worth reading.  Make up your own mind about its merits.

I went into this expecting some level of entertainment, but this movie was poorly written, poorly directed, and exceptionally...I mean miserable acted.

Take a chance and watch it, you'll be pleasantly surprised, just as I was.

B00973CGXK|2.0|Simply stated, this album is beneath \\"The Killers\\". I think that Brandon Flowers used his best material to record \\"Flamingo\\", and anything that wasn't good enough to use on that album went to \\"Battle Born\\". I still love this band, and maybe this album will grow on me the way that \\"Sawdust\\" did. But for now I sit broken hearted and await the next Christmas song to come from the band.

0425263908|5.0|Book #1 in the Crossfire Series<br /><br />Eva is beginning a new chapter of life:  a new apartment in a new city with a new job.  Luckily, her best friend moved from California to New York with her.  But, she never expected to meet someone, especially not Gideon Cross, who turns her life upside down.<br /><br />Move of Christian Grey, Gideon Cross has entered the building!<br /><br />Eva is far from perfect.  Sure, she appears to have the perfect life in the perfect apartment paid for by the perfect stepfather, but appearances are deceiving.  Luckily, Eva is smart and worldy so when she runs into Gideon, she's aware of her immediate lust and is not scared of it.  But, as she learns more about Gideon, she realizes how easily this man could open up painful memories from the past.<br /><br />Outwardly, Gideon seems to be very different than Eva.  As the story progresses, we learn that this billionaire who runs an empire has some very personal issues.  Importantly, Gideon and Eva are very similar, both having traumatic pasts and jealousy issues.<br /><br />The plot is the relationship between Eva and Gideon.  Although their relationship is steamy hot, these two extend beyond the bedroom.  Interestingly, everything is smooth sailing intimately, but mentally these two have it rough since both have major personal issues to overcome.  At times, I wondered if Gideon and Eva should go their separate ways because they seem to spark bad memories in each other.  Needless to say, the plot is emotional, and at times frustrating, because the reader cares for these two characters.<br /><br />Bared to You may be cited as a 50 Shades of Grey clone.  To some extent, it is.  Where the books differ is Eva and Gideon pasts directly motivate their actions during the course of the book.  Generally, this book is much darker and doesn't have whips and secret rooms.<br /><br />I loved Bared to You.  The characters have depth, the story emotional, and not centered around the bedroom.

The chocolate chip cookies are really good especially if you make it with coconut oil that has some coconut flavor.  Cupcakes were pretty tasty as well.  The rest has been hit and miss. The banana bread makes way too much batter, found out after the second attempt that you only put half the batter in the pan????  What the hell?  Why do that?  All in all the directions are not great and I have never gotten the frosting to turn out.<br /><br />As far as the ingredients, I live in NW Indiana and I don't have any troubles finding the ingredients at my grocery stores.  What I can't find there can be found at the health food store.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I purchased the book but I am disappointed in the overall quality of the instructions.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I'm still undecided abut this book. It haunts me, it got under my skin...I was angry and mystified when I read it, but I couldn't put it down.<br />As a parent-this book is about the unimaginable-but as a parent, I wanted to SCREAM at the father character. Do people really just \\"accept\\" their children and never ever question?  I will say it further motivated me to ALWAYS keep and open line of communication with my daughter and to fight hard on her behalf-with eyes wide open.
B000001EKX|5.0|The beginning....... In 1974 KISS released their first 3 albums in 12 months.  Hotter Than Hell was the 2nd one.  They were new on the scene, touring constantly, trying to find their sound and creating a live following.  HTH documents this scenario perfectly.<br /><br />The sound on the album can only be described as bass driven and muddy.  The guitar solos are Ace's most unique and the songwriting is basic, cavemanish, rushed, unpolished, raw & simple.<br /><br />All of the things mentioned above ended up being perfect ingredients for an incredible album. A snapshot of the time when a beast was learning how to walk and hunt and kill.<br /><br />Seems to me that for KISS the songs that they come up with fast and record live in the studio seem to be their best.  If you overthink it or beat it to death,  the initial urgency/passion of the song fades away.  Hotter Than Hell is one of a kind.  No other KISS album is like it.  If you were to clean it up or try to make it sound better you would destroy it.<br /><br />All 4 band members put their stamp on this one.  Strange ways is so unique that it is the highlight of this album.  The guitar solo cannot be duplicated.  Frehley channels the spirits of tortured souls through his Les Paul and the Marshall Amplifier can barely keep them contained from entering our dimension.  When I played Strange Ways in the car my wife thought the cassette was dragging.....she hated it.....naturally I loved it and informed her that it was actually a CD and that it just has that slow, sludgy, heaviness.  The only thing that has ever come close to the solo is Randy Bachman (BTO) guitar solo in \\"Second Hand\\" 2:05-end of song.<br /><br />This album came out when KISS was hungry.....and it shows!!!

B008XG1X18|2.0|I had lots of people tell me to get on Pinterest because it was a great way to keep track of recipes and share ideas, but when I joined I was disappointed to see that it looked like a collage of junk put together by someone in middle school. It took me several weeks to figure out how to actually pin something, and then it was next to impossible for me to find that item again. I figured it was just user error, so I had some folks explain to me how to use it. I pinned something else, or so I thought. When I went to retrieve it, it took me to the generic website but not the actual page I thought I had Pinned. This is not worth the time and effort for me to figure out. It's much easier to just google and bookmark pages I like. Perhaps if I were 13, I'd have no problem with it.

0446547573|5.0|I really liked this book.<br /><br />Stayed up too long reading it.<br /><br />Just adding this review so that Amazon will recommend books like this (it wasn't digital.  Given to me by my mom.)
030758836X|2.0|Yes, this author can write. Yes, the plot is a clever string-along. Yes, the characters have voices. The problem I find with this highly recommended (and for me, that made it even more disappointing)bit of fluff is that I kept asking myself, \\"So what?\\" Are we supposed to care about these people? I don't mind unlikeable characters if there is a reason they are so inherently unlikeable. What are we supposed to learn from their inherently unlikeable selves? These characters are merely superficial, glittery on-the-surface, self-important by virtue of having lived in NYC, too-old-to-be adolescents who have never reached emotional maturity. Oh sure, there are the weirdly exclusive psychologist parents on the one hand and the rageful, domineering father on the other by way of explanation; but both Amy and Nick are just plain shallow -- snarky, clever with words, and lacking in anything substantial that makes them interesting human beings. If that's the author's point (and it might be) -- she may be attempting to paint a lost generation, fooled by the initial glamour of high paying jobs and city sparkle into believing that they were really living lives, and then hit squarely on the head by the country's economic woes -- she misses the mark. What might have been a generational commentary gets lost in its own cleverness. It becomes a mirror for the writer's own self-conscious display of word power -- as if she's looking in a mirror and admiring herself aloud. For readers who find delight in plot, this book might be acceptable -- it does offer a twist and a surprise, although I found the plot to be stumble along rather than unwind deliciously. For readers who value an author's writing ability, this book might promise and tantalize for the first 20 pages or so, but its ultimate lack of substance will ultimately disappoint. Words get tiring without substance.
B006VRDZ44|4.0|We're a little behind the curve on this series but haven't heard a whole lot about it.  Very interesting role for Buscemi (sp?).  He's doing a great job at it and can tell he gets more comfortable with being the lead as the series moves forward.

After upgrading fb reader it reads to me but can't handle acrobat books and kindle can as well as being able to go dirrect to amazon. However you pay for books and can't access them through other programs like fb reader. For that I drop 2 stars. Good overall but needs improving to meet its competition.

B0079J27SS|5.0|T. Beers has already written an excellent review of this set with which I largely agree; there are just a few things I can add.<br /><br />First, as to the performances:  One of the things that makes Klemperer's Mozart well worth hearing is the way he shapes the phrases.  35+ years ago I studied conducting in school (during which time I figured out, among other things, that I was ill-suited to the task); we used Mozart's 39th and 40th symphonies as two of our study scores.  I got to know them very well while \\"conducting\\" along with Bruno Walter on my modest stereo.  They are not particularly complicated pieces (which is one of the amazing things about Mozart -- a beautiful simplicity), and, in a sense, they can \\"play themselves.\\"  But what a good conductor can (and will) do is shape and balance the melodic lines so they sing, and this is especially important when the lines are shifting back and forth among instrumental groupings.  (Listen, for example, to the way the lines interweave perfectly in the 2nd movement of Symphony 40 as \\"managed\\" by Klemperer.  This is a characteristic that, in my opinion at least, we sometimes miss in conductor-less \\"historically informed performances.\\")<br /><br />Next, about the sound:  These performances were recorded and first issued in the late '50's, early '60's as EMI/Columbia \\"SAX\\" series LP's in the UK.  Some of the SAX LP's are considered great treasures among LP fanciers, and for good reason -- some of them, even by today's standards, have remarkable sound (not infrequently attributed to the all-tube electronics used in the process in the day).  Klemperer's Mahler's 4th is a particularly good example, and is not an inexpensive purchase in the audiophile LP market.  However, others of the Klemperer EMI recordings from the same general time frame (such as the Brahms symphonies) don't seem as fine.<br /><br />I would have liked to have been able to compare the sound on a few of the original releases to these new remasterings, but I don't have them in my collection; instead, I have a box of the complete Klemperer EMI Mozart that was issued on LP in the '70's.  Hardcore LP collectors would dismiss the later LP box over the early SAX's, but I think the 70's issues are pretty darn good.  I compared both the '70's LP's and a \\"Klemperer Legacy\\" CD of Symphony 40 and 41 to the new reissues. (I was using an EMM Sacd player for the new CD's -- I haven't actually heard the CD layer.)<br /><br />For what it's worth, I would rank the new issues as being better than the \\"Klemperer Legacy\\" CD, but I personally preferred the LP's.  I hear the LP's as having greater delicacy and detail.  Nevertheless, I am quite happy to have these new remasterings -- they seem a bit warmer than that last remasterings from the Klemperer Legacy series.  And, let's face it: LP's are a pain, and most people won't mess with them...sometimes including me.  Also, while some of the early stereo Klemperer recordings would be considered \\"audiophile\\" by today's standards, I don't think I could put these Mozart recordings in that catagory...although this listening session caused me to conclude that I need to be on the lookout for the SAX LP issues, because the performances are so good.<br /><br />So, these are classic Mozart symphony performances in sound that is reasonably satisfying, all for not much money.  Hard to go wrong.I don't have them in my collection; instead, I have a box of the complete Klemperer EMI Mozart that was issued on LP in the '70's.

0553211978|5.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance.  But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality.  The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story.  That fiction is just that.<br /><br />Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends.  She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home -  Northanger Abbey.  Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance).  The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite.  They are wealthy \\"English Christians.\\"<br /><br />There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners.  Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel.
B0054N73EY|5.0|RHCP never fail to deliver. This new CD ROCKS. It is great to hear some of the tracks that were not included in Stadium Arcadium as well as newer stuff. From the time Rain Dance Maggie came out as a pre-release I have been looking forward to buying this CD. Definitely not disappointed.
1593080484|5.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is the book a lot of people can relate to, including myself.  A story of letting \\"The One\\" get away and the miracle of second chances.  The title may not have been her choice (brother Henry named the book after her death), but this is all Austen.  It shows how both society and greed for money can be very persuasive.<br /><br />The father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a selfish man who falls prey to extravagants.  The widow with three daughters becomes indebted.  He is influenced to rent out their home and stay at Bath.  He is influenced by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay (a greedy widow of slight lower class to the Elliots).  Lady Russell is a friend of the Elliots and godmother to Ann.  The Lady is the cause to the way Anne Eliot (at age 18) loses her true love, Frederick Wentworth.  Lady Russell finds this was erroneous for persuading Anne's decision.<br /><br />At the age of 27, Anne Elliot is classified as spinster.  Her two very selfish and arrogant sisters have both been indifferent towards their middle sister Anne.  Anne has let everyone control her in every way.  In my opinion, I can understand Frederick's hesitation towards rekindling his love to Anne.<br /><br />The novel is a favorite of mine.  It is shorter than all of Jane's novels and the storyline more simple, but it's still a great love story.  I agree that it is like a Cinderella story.  I sincerely recommend this.
1400052181|5.0|This book was a memorable read for many reasons. It is well written and researched; so many topics are covered such as poverty, ignorance, ethics, mental health and morals. I admire the author's hard work and dedication to bring this story to light. It is a must read.
0553213342|5.0|Published in 1811 but still a book that can be enjoyed and related to today's generations.  A widowed mother taking care of three daughters.  Being evicted from their home and moves into a relative's home.  The daughters all taught that they don't have to marry into money or their social class.  They're also encouraged to be well educated in all subjects.<br /><br />Now in the early 1800's, women were not allowed to own property.  They didn't have civil rights that we do now.  So when Henry Dashwood dies,  the successor of all of Henry's property is John Dashwood (son by Henry's first marriage).  Henry's second wife, Mrs. Dashwood (40 y.o.), is forced to find another place for herself and her 3 daughters.  John Dashwood is a man who allows his wife to manipulate him.  He wants to do right and follow his father's dying wish, but the spoiled wife convinces him otherwise.<br /><br />The title \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was not Austen's original decision.  None the less, the title is an example way English teachers want for comparison and contrast essays.  The usage of the two terms are also fitting.  In this case, sense refers to Elinor Dashwood.  She is the eldest daughter and 19 years old.  Elinor is reasonable and reserved toward her feelings.  Romanticism is apart of the definition of sensibility.  Marianne (the 16 y.o. middle daughter) and Mrs. Dashwood both where their hearts on their sleeves.  They rely on their emotions for all the decisions they makes.  The youngest daughter, Margaret Dashwood (13), is also romantic but is still young.<br /><br />Mrs. Ferrars, Fanny Dasholwood, and Robert Ferrars believe in social class and high status of wealth.  None of them have job or money income.  They live off their inheritance and marriage dowries.  I was very pleased with Edward Ferrars' decision.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon MP3 was the answer to the problem of finding novelty tunes, sound effects, movie themes and science fiction music.  I fondly remembered all the novelty tunes of the 1970's which were played regularly on the radio.  But how to listen again?  I certainly don't want entire albums in some cases.  So I picked out the ones I like from Amazon MP3, and viola - back to the fun times.  Thank you , Amazon MP3.

1574214276|5.0|Pattern has been a passion of mine as far back as I can remember. Zentangle has been a part of my life since August 17, 2012, a little over two months.<br /><br />Since discovering this art form in Joanne Fink's book \\"Zenspirations - Letters & Patterning\\", I have purchased nearly every Zentangle book I can find, as well as the kit at Zentangle.com, created by the founders of this art form, Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas.<br /><br />As a beginner in this art, I found \\"Joy of Zentangle - Drawing Your Way to Increased Creativity, Focus, and Well-Being\\" to be comprehensive, informative and truly inspiring. It is a fabulous book.<br /><br />\\"Joy\\" is the perfect word to describe how I feel about this book. \\"Joy of Zentangle\\" includes step-by-step illustrations showing how to create each of the 101 tangles presented in Chapter 5. A very high percentage of these 101 tangles are new to me, and the few familiar designs (such as Hollibaugh and Rick's Paradox) are classics that belong in a book as comprehensive as this one.<br /><br />These are just some of the features that set this book apart from the rest:<br /><br />  The inspiring stories of how Zentangle has touched lives. A little \\"Chicken Soup for the Zentangle Soul\\".<br /><br />  Color photographs of objects that inspired some of the tangles shown in the book.<br /><br />  Fun exercises to expand your tangle repertoire.<br /><br />  Better instructions for shading techniques.<br /><br />  The best and most thorough explanation I've found in book form of what Zentangle is.<br /><br />  A foreword/introduction by Alan Giagnocavo, Publisher, Fox Chapel Publishing/Design Originals. He gets it.<br /><br />This book is an excellent value. Full price or discounted, I think it is worth every penny. I know I'll come back to it time and time again for reference and inspiration.
1451695195|5.0|First I want to address something:<br /><br />Don't pay any attention to two types who insist on writing negative reviews...<br /><br />1. Dogmatic fundamentalists don't like this book because they don't see Jesus in every word. They think he's making it all up because it doesn't fit their predefined view of the afterlife.<br /><br />2. Idiots who never bothered to read the book and weigh in with their negative viewpoints because that is just what they are...negative.<br /><br />Read the book and THEN weigh in with your honest impressions.<br /><br />Having studied NDE's for years I find that the author's experience reflects those of people all over the world from a variety of different religious faiths and no religion at all.<br /><br />Read this book. It will change your life!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I still remember hearing Love Story for the first time watching my son at the skating rink.  That song really hit me so I asked the DJ who it was and he told me Taylor Swift.  Never heard of her but I got the CD anyway but did not expect much.  Was really pleasantly surprised to find that many of the other songs were awesome too and almost as good as Love Story. Especially like Fifteen, Love Story, Hey Stephen, White Horse, You Belong With Me and The Best Day.  Highly recommended!  Here's how I rank the songs from 10 - awesome to 1- terrible:<br /><br />  1.

0307887448|5.0|There are books about video games. There are books about 80s pop culture. And there are books about dystopian future societies. And then there's \\"Ready Player One\\" that takes the best tidbits, fun facts, imaginings, what-ifs, and neat-o elements of all of the above and puts them together for a really smashing read. The best part of it all is that the way that Cline sets the scene makes his descriptions of the future seem entirely plausible, and hell, maybe in a couple of years they will be more reality than fiction.<br /><br />The scene is just a few years in the future where all of society lives life more online in a virtual reality simulation called the Oasis than they do in \\"real life\\" because of the energy crisis and its results for humankind. The creator of the Oasis, James Halladay, a notorious shut-in with a love of 80s culture and geek-lore has died and left his multibillions up for grabs by any Oasis user who can find his hidden \\"Easter Egg\\" within the simulation. From here, the story just gets more elaborate and more intriguing, linking up 80s info with futuristic technology and capabilities. The hero, avatar Perzval aka Wade Watts, is clever, smart and honest. He, and the other hunters of the Easter Egg, aka \\"Gunters,\\" have a depth and interaction that makes the book a quick read and quite enjoyable.<br /><br />And the ending doesn't suck either. It isn't contrived and builds to where we find our hero (and heroine?). The whole time I was reading this book, I thought that it would make a great movie. Looking into it online, it appears that this effort is in the works. I could see this book being a cult favorite easily. A MUST READ!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers was an amazing movie! It was extremly action packed with an amazing cast of comedic performers. I bought the four disc combo pack which included a blue-ray 3d/blue-ray/DVD+Digital copy+Digital Music Download. All for less than $25.00. This was such an awesome deal. I would totally recommend this product.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Very nice but don't know how to skip to the letter that is required for me to find other than that very nice
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it can be or seemed to at first kind of a kiddy's game but I enjoy it. Just wish the regeneration was faster. Kind of impatient.
B00933ZIF2|3.0|The plot is interesting, but each episode it becomes harder to tell the \\"Good guys\\" from the \\"Bad guys\\", with CIA ignoring the law, and using any means to stop a far fetched theory to shoot the President at a mile away with a rifle and the wind gusts and heat from an airport making this so improbable that no one would take it serously.<br /><br />The CIA characters worry me more than their targets based on the illegal use of drugs, unbelievable conduct, and contempt for the lie detector with the unreliable results.  With all the moles they have found in the real FBI (Hanson) and CIA (Pollard), I'm not sure what the point of this story really is.<br /><br />I doubt that there can be real \\"sleepers\\" or people programmed to do attempt terrorists acts without being on drugs and having constant brainwashing for long periods of time like Sirhan Sirhan.  Now that Brody is supposedly cleared, except for the admitted murder of someone he thought was Walker, it makes a little more sense.
B008H6GH8I|3.0|\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" (known in Japan as \\"Biohazard: Damnation) is a survival action film based on Capcom's original video game. Set in a fictional European country of \\"Eastern Slav Republic,\\" the computer graphics animation follows the story of Leon Scott Kennedy, a special agent sent by the US government to the civil war-torn nation in order to investigate the connection between the anti-government forces and \\"BOW\\"s or Bio Organic Weapons.<br /><br />Though his original mission is aborted, Leon infiltrates the government's facilities on his own, and encounters Alexander 'Sasha' Kozachenko, a school teacher-turned- anti-government group leader. In the meanwhile, a mysterious agent Ada Wong enters the Office of the President Belikova, with her hidden agenda.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is directed by Makoto Kamiya, who also directed \\"Resident Evil: Degeneration,\\" the first CG film inspired by the original game. He started his career as an assistant special effects director (his earlier works include \\"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah\\" and \\"Gamera 2: Attack of Legion\\"), and went on to become special effects director for such live-action films as \\"Doomsday: The Sinking of Japan\\" and \\"Gantz.\\"<br /><br />As director Kamiya certainly knows how to stage thrilling action sequences that benefit from the clever use of locations and lighting. Weapon and creature designs are first-rate. The creatures (crawling \\"lickers\\") are grotesque and its movements are creepy, and there is one great combat sequence at the film's climax involving \\"tyrants.\\" Characters' motion-captured movements are much improved than those in \\"Degeneration.\\"<br /><br />Still, his Roland Emmerich-like visual-heavy narrative style may divide opinions. The storyline (script penned Shotaro Suga, also responsible for \\"Degeneration\\") is not very interesting, showing its hand too early; dialogues are uninspired; and some expository writings (including the opening about the country's political background) are boring.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is an improvement on its predecessor as far as its visuals go. What it needs is a better story that these popular characters Leon and Ada deserve.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Follow-up to initial review: I've been playing this game for two months now and I am really addicted. This game is being given low reviews because of it's push as a pay to play game which I admit had me aggravated at the beginning. It took me about 10 days of playing 20 minutes a day before I got to a point where I found tricks to earn energy faster. This game has complex and layered objectives: find the objects in the room, gather required objects as you complete rooms which help build collections. Collect objects from creatures by banishing them to help \\"charge\\" your collections, redeem collection items, coins and diamonds for energy, charms and tools.<br /><br />I was hesitant to use the friends feature at first since none of my friends play this and i was literally asking strangers to help me collect objects. This is the key to not spending money. I trade objects with about 150+ 'friends' who are playing from level 10 to level 142. I don't need to spend diamonds on objects most of the time, I ask my 'friends' for them. Most of them pay attention and know what I need.<br /><br />I only succumbed to spend 0.99 one time when I was new at it and didn't know that you will gain 5 diamonds everytime you \\"level up\\"  through gained Experience points. There are ways to \\"buy\\" energy, although you can't buy it directly. HINT: Energy can be restored faster through using copper phoenixes, which may be purchased for coins. But you can only use this charm 2 times a day. Several collections also result in rewarded food items, which will restore energy. You also get energy restored with each \\"level up.\\" I have a found a few ways to quickly gather and charge collection objects which allow me to level up faster by giving me the experience needed or collect a food. So when I exhaust energy through room searches, I start working on my friends list to gather my collections items. I'm at level 66 now and I usually play cumulatively 1.5 hours a day and level up every 24-48 hours. I've managed to stay in the top 1% of the leaderboards since learning these tricks.<br /><br />There seems to be no end in the game, they keep adding new aspects. I now have a christmas tree....wheeee.<br /><br />I would've given this five stars, but the hidden objects in the rooms barely change. After two months of play, that is the least challenging part of the game anymore.<br /><br />My Original review:<br />I like the hunting although I wish the objects would vary a bit. Great graphics!<br />I'm not sure I fully understand the complex objectives. there seems to be a lot going on.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time! Sometimes, the goodness of something lies in what it conjures in your memory and heart.  Hearing Purcell's orchestra brought back SO MANY memories of ballet class... However, aside from that, this movie was very well done.  Cheers to Love, Laughter, Music and the beautiful imperfections in us all!

0985081821|1.0|It was slow paced, the characters were impossibly boring and the story wasn't engaging. I can't believe I kept reading. There were so many fantastic reviews that I thought things would change. They didn't. I'm so angry that I wasted my time on this drivel, when there are so many fantastic reads out there.
B004L8A34U|3.0|\\"The Road Home\\" is the story of how one man's parents met and fell in love.  The story begins in the modern day as the son learns of his father's death.  He returns home to help his grieving mother and to take care of burying his father.  In the process of doing this, he tells the story of his mother and father falling in love.<br /><br />There is a lot about this film to like.  For one - its simplicity, it is the simple tale of how two people fell in love.  No intricate plots, heavy handed dialogue, thick symbolism requiring multiple commentary tracks for comprehension; just a boy and a girl falling in love to live a simple life happily ever after.<br /><br />The music is amazing.  Its use, along with some of the shots of the rolling hills and landscape, reminded me of \\"Braveheart\\" - which at its core is a love story as well.  The film is scored well to help heighten your emotional response to the characters and the story.<br /><br />I really liked the shift from the modern day being shot in B&W and all the past being in color.  It is a nice way to show the emotional state of Di.  Her old age and now broken heart that Luo is dead.  Her love is gone.  Her son will never see his father again.  The world has lost its appeal to her and become a grey, lifeless place.  This contrasts nicely with her memories of youth and first meeting Luo.  I like they chose to shoot those scenes in the fall, when landscapes are at their most colorful.  It was also a good choice for her to always be seen in that bright red jacket, which always made her stand out both from the colors of the landscape around her and the other villagers - none of whom wore bright, bold colors like that.  They all wore basic earth tones and kind of fade into the scenery.  Even when she is young, when Luo is taken back to the city the season changes to winter and is able to take on the neutral, almost B&W look of the modern day to represent her sadness.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really well-made, beautifully filmed and scored film with the most universal of all ideas, a nice, simple love story.lly filmed and scored film with the most universal of all ideas, a nice, simple love story.
B008NEVPCC|4.0|I went on amazon looking for Cher Lloyd's new CD. Since she has two versions of the same CD (the US and UK version, they both share the same songs but some songs replace the other songs on the two albums), I wanted the two extra songs on the US version from the UK version. However, this album is NOT the deluxe version, as it states in the title. It does NOT have the two extra tracks I wanted. I suggest that people look for the REAL US bonus track. I do not suggest getting the UK version because it does not share some of the same songs on the US track.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to You needs to be read before this book for the reader to understand all that's going on. The first book is very similar to Fifty Shades but this book is a story of its own. It kept my attention and I couldn't hardly put it down. I definately recommend this book to those who enjoy Love, mystery, and everthing that keeps you thinking. Can't wait til book 3.

B005CX53RU|5.0|I bought this as a spare battery for my Sennheiser MM-550's.  It's the exact same battery that comes with them already (and apparently works in many other models of Sennheisers).  That's great not only for Sennheiser (cheaper production), but great for the customer --one battery, many models of headphones.<br /><br />What I like the most about this battery?  Two things:<br />1. Long life - it lasts between 8-10 hours on average for listening to music (depending on settings, volume, etc)<br />2. You can charge it via MicroUSB without it being inside the headphones.<br /><br />I usually am using my headphones and, when needed, charging the second set.  I use my 550's about 8-10 hours/day each day.<br /><br />That being said, one way to drain your battery much quicker is when you're using it as a headset (talking on the phone).
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was a well crafted tale of our sixteenth president. The casting was spot on with both Lincoln's youthful and presidential days being played by Benjamin Walker. The fights as well as the transitions from scene to scene (without giving away anything) were as stylized and imaginative as the premise of the story itself.
B002LL13AM|2.0|\\"Cato, the Devil comes to us in many guises,\\" Father Melchizedek OP said portentously to his trusty man-servant; \\"and not least as the viper of Karajanism!\\"<br /><br />\\"Your Eminence, do you think it's a good idea for me to wear my underpants on the outside of me trousers?\\" Cato whined. \\"And why have I got this old towel hanging out from the back of my shirt like it's some sort of cape?\\"<br /><br />The High Priest of Period Practice drew himself up to his full height (some five foot two).<br /><br />\\"Don't bore me with your petty inconveniences,\\" the cleric replied sprucely as he adjusted his cassock. \\"If we are to take our quest to the streets as HIPster crime-fighters - it's `kapow' time on Deutsche Grammophon - we must look the part. In my episcopal robes, I look like the Dark Knight whereas you resemble the Boy Wonder when you are attired as such. No-one must learn our true identities - no-one. Here, put on this gimp mask; and speaking of which, I must inform you of your wider responsibilities once we get back to the Bat Cave!\\"<br /><br />Cato gulped.<br /><br />\\"It's time to move,\\" Father Melchizedek whinnied. \\"Here is our first mission for the night. It is time to bring the Riddler to justice - Period Practice justice!\\"<br /><br />\\"The Riddler - who's he?\\"<br /><br />\\"Old Maurie Pollini. Sometimes he's known as Mister Freeze. He's called the Riddler as he is never straightforward. Is he on or is he off? Is it a revelatory performance or is he on auto-pilot? He's been an absconder from justice for far too long. My sources tell me he is playing Bach on a  . . . . . Steinway down at the wharves. Is there anything more horrific? What a travesty! That should consign him to the Arkham Asylum for the remainder of his natural life. Pollini is getting sloppy in his old age and I am not just talking about his rubato. His Bach playing days on a grand-piano are over!\\"<br /><br />The two men jumped in the carbon-neutral HIPster-mobile (a Toyota Prius) and motored down to the wharves. Fog greeted them. Any number of unsavoury characters were loitering around to no good end.<br /><br />\\"Wait here, Boy Wonder. I will handle this myself. Just keep the engine running. I'll throw the Riddler in the boot and we'll be away!\\"<br /><br />Crosier in hand, the cleric leapt from the HIPster-mobile. After checking his bearings, he strode down the street and took the first left. That led him to a derelict warehouse. Its door was unlocked. Upon saying a prayer to St David of Munrow, he strode in.  It was darker than Satan's sewage pipe. Disconcerting as that was, the cleric was more agitated upon hearing Bach's 48 being played unashamedly on a Steinway for all it was worth and more.  The recital was coming from deep within the bowels of the complex. A torch from his utility-belt guided his steps.<br /><br />\\"Abhorrent though it be,\\" Father Melchizedek said to himself, \\"if Bach is to be played on a Steinway, this is the way to do it. It's surprising: nothing in Pollini's output to date predicates such mastery!\\"<br /><br />He came to a door. It was shut. The recital was clearing emanating from the room beyond. Just as he was about to burst in and apprehend the villain, his mobile-phone rang. It was Cato.<br /><br />\\"Your Eminence, Reuters is carrying the news that Morrie Pollini has voluntarily handed himself over to the authorities of the Arkham Asylum. Reason: his survey of the First Book of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. The reporter actually spoke to the Italian pianist as he was signing the paperwork in a trembling hand. Pollini said he regretted ever making this disc. It is little more than a Chopin-esque tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach with some faux-polyphony thrown in for good measure. Bach, so he stated, was not in his DNA. Scant attention is paid to the inner voices and when they do emerge, they sound contrived. Tears were in Pollini's eyes when he stated that he was not the man to translate such resplendent polyphony to an instrument thatwas foreign to the Kantor of St Thomas. The hard, metallic DG recording does not assist his cause. I think Pollini has finally come to his senses. If I could summarise: this is a master pianist tackling a repertoire that is foreign to him.It is adept enough but in Bach, Pollini is no Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Ghoul, Angela Hewitt or Wilhelm Kempff, to say nothing of Ed. . . . .\\"<br /><br />\\"Hush, hush, my trusty man-servant.

He was now standing in a large gallery. A Steinway was nearby. A spectre with a large mop of hair was seated at the keyboard. A candelabra shed light on his face.

B008SOS63S|4.0|I saw part of the DVD of this concert on Palladia last night.  I was impresed enough to go to the local music store and over pay for this CD as I did not want to wait to get it shipped.  I was so impressed that I found Joe B's tour schedule and was about to buy tickets at about $100 a shot.<br /><br />Well on further review there are some excellent songs on this CD which are mostly the songs I saw played but unfortunately there are more that are ordinary at best on a critical listening.  Joe B's a good guitar player but he's more Jeff Healey or Kenny Wayne Shepard (both very good guitarists) than Stevie Ray Vaughn.  John Mayer could outplay him on some blues on feel, tone and fretwork.  He's got a strong band but his voice is fairly flat and rarely does he play without a ton of electronic processing which covers up much imprecision.  In my humble opinion he is far from the best guitarist out there on many different levels.  He is talented,  he is showy (nice cuff links) and he puts on a good  concert (so I may still go) but that's about it.  I had high hopes for Joe but he lacks both the technical virtuosity and creativity necessary to be anything other than a \\"pretty good\\" guitarist.
B000SEFNMS|1.0|From the moment I read from many aspects false Krakauer's report on the Everest accident called Into thin air, I disliked his way of writing, thinking and false self-absorbed reporting. I still decided to give him another go with Into the wild. A mistake. I spent the first 3/4 of the book waiting for Alaskan trip of the boy to begin. And had to endure author's accounts of anything he could even remotely connect to the story (including one of his own solo climbs, oh yes that's how cool he is).<br />Apart from the dislike I have for the author, coming from a part of the world still suffering consequences of a brutal war, I have little understanding for a rich kid with not a single problem in life but a troubled mind that leads him to suicide.<br />What a bad book to sellect for my first Kindle purchase. I wish myself more luck with the next one.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|The breadth of this novel is breathtaking.  To be drawn into journey after journey and ripped from each before obtaining the denouement I, as the Reader, feel is my due...<br />To be entirely pulled out of the book by the fact of missing pages (yes, the content is eventually delivered but the pages are still missing) wrong footed me so I abandoned my Reader role to perform the role of outraged Consumer, only to, upon reflection, begin to suspect the interruptions to be a device of the author...<br />Oh Mr. Mitchell, how dare you make me think.  I was looking for escapism but found so much more.<br />To other Readers, surrender to Mr. Mitchell's flow to wherever it might take you.  Bon voyage.
B008G12ERC|1.0|Let me start off by saying I have been a huge fan of Muse's work, and I have enjoyed spacing out and listening to their previous albums on plenty of occasions.  But, this one is literally unbearable to listen to and I never would have expected it to happen Muse (at least not anytime soon).  I understand they were trying to do something different, but they couldn't have failed any worse than they did with 2nd Law. Sad thing is, when I first heard the single Madness on radio I was thinking to myself if this is the best they could come up with for the first single of the album, I wonder what the rest is going to sound like.  I thought well maybe they are just putting the most marketable song out there to start.  But nope, the rest of the album was just as terrible. The lyrics were bland and were over working the music, the album was way over-produced and over-synthed, the tracks didn't mesh together in any shape or form, and all the songs on the album just seemed way too simple compared to Muse's previous bodies of work.  There is a complete lack of rock elements to the texture of the music, i.e lack of unadulterated guitars and distortion.  My main question would be who were they trying to market this crap to?  12 year old Tween Wave fan's?  When I think of Muse I think of them as the antithesis of that horrible crap known as Dub-Step, yet they embrace it?  It seems as though they put very little effort into trying to make a great album.  I was expecting big things with this album, but ended up being severely disappointed.<br /><br />I would highly recommend to anyone that is thinking of purchasing this, to save their money.  Hopefully, they will move on from this epic disappointment quickly and get back to work on some real music.<br /><br />Take out tracks 12-13 (which aren't even songs), the two tracks that Chris Wolstenholme severely butchered, the prelude that honestly didn't make sense to put on the album (other than to make it seem like you are getting more songs for your buck) and you are left with 8 actual tracks.<br /><br />The album starts off with the track Supremacy, which starts off like it was going to be an instant classic, but Bellamy somehow managed to completely butcher the song (a rare occurrence) with lyrics that completely did not fit with the way the song was going.  The uber-pop track Panic Station was the most probably the most complete and catchy song on the album, and that is not saying much and you could clearly notice that they tried way too hard to make it a hit.  Survival is prob the worst Muse song ever recorded.  Madness seemed like it could have been a hit, had it not been for the super-repetitive synths and Crap-Step rip offs.  Animals is another song that starts off very strong, but only to get ruined by poorly executed lyrics.  And lastly Follow Me, Explorers, and Big Freeze aren't even good enough to be B-side. One thing that repeatedly stood out was Bellamy seemed to do a very poor job when it came to arranging and writing the lyrics.<br /><br />All in all The 2nd Law was a massive let down, considering how great they have been prior.

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Though I like Manners more, I still love this new album. The songs Cry Like A Ghost and Constant Conversations are so catchy. Definitely don't regret buying this album! I listen to it like everyday! :)

B008MM9630|3.0|Love the game,  addictive and great graphics. Reasonable amount of coins and crystals earned by ur effort and completing quests,  but cant purchase anything,  freezes and have to log out and in and nothing. Please fix bug otherwise would have to uninstall.

B00169N0BK|1.0|I've had this product for about a month now and can't seem to get it right. It did nicely on my monitor although the change was minimal. My printer is a whole 'nother ball game. My prints now have a disgusting olive drab cast to them and I can't get rid of it. I will attempt contacting customer service again this Monday and hope. I'm fairly inept with computers so the problem is most likely me but ... well after a month I'm getting frustrated. I have several hundred photos I need to print for up coming shows and an Epson 4900 series printer that at this point is about as useful a boat anchor. For the time being, the ColorMunki Photo gets ZERO stars until it works. (Awww,I had to give it one star to post this review.)  I'll let everyone know what I think when it actually works for me. If anyone has any insight into this problem all help is appreciated!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|We have owned the standard Canon over-the-shoulder bag, but this backpack blows it away. It is wonderful quality, the perfect size, and has a nook and cranny for everything. I also like that it doesn't have a name brand plastered all over it, so it looks like a normal (albeit smaller) backpack, reducing the risk of theft. When we go out with our camera, the front pocket is big enough for me to put my things in so I can leave my purse at home. It's also very comfortable, with padded straps to reduce neck/pain/shoulder pain and chafing. We have owned this for almost two years now, and love it. For the quality and price, it's a perfect buy.
B0083L22U4|4.0|I was very excited when I saw a new CD from Ultravox. They are by far one of my favorite bands from the 80's and this CD is fantastic! I forget how much I love their music until I hear it again, and on the day I bought this CD I had come across the song \\"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\\" for the first time in a long time. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is an 80's kid like me. It is indeed \\"Brilliant\\".
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a great relaxing puzzle game,...........................<br />if ur into visual puzzles then this game is great.  the music is relaxing as well.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|I just played this game with my 7 yr old and 9 yr old.  There are so many problems with this game I don't even know where to start!  I rarely leave reviews, but I hated this game so much, I just had to let people know.<br /><br />First, as many reviewers stated, there are not enough parts to make anything.  We had to say things like, \\"Ignore that these bricks are green.  There aren't enough red.\\"  Sometimes, there aren't even enough pieces in a size in ANY color to make what you want to make!  MADDENING!!<br /><br />Second, it takes so long for anyone to actually make anything, the other players are bored stiff just waiting.  BORING!!<br /><br />Third, it's HARD to make things!  My poor daughter ended up in tears everytime it was her turn.  After three rounds, we gave up.  Even after someone builds something, they have to give MAJOR hints to everyone so that it can be guessed.  FRUSTRATING!!<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this game.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|Taylor Swift Red - What can I say? I knew I was in trouble when I heard this album.<br /><br />Having been a huge fan of country music for many years it seemed only natural to like Taylor Swift, even though her music has always blurred the lines of both pop and country she has always had that country element in every single one of her songs.<br /><br />This album is of course the only exception to that rule, many of the songs (the worst being I Knew You Were Trouble) have absolutely no sense of country element in them. Perhaps this was Taylor's aim to market her music at an entirely different audience, but I am afraid I am a firm believer in pleasing your already existsing fans and I do believe there are country fans out there that feel Taylor sold out.
B004H0ZH66|2.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  Sadly, this transfer appears to have been done on the cheap.  When I first put the disc into my blu-ray player, the quality of the picture was so bad that I thought they had sold me a DVD by mistake.  I then put my old DVD in, and the pictures were identical.  In fact, the DVD might have been slightly better!  I did put the blu-ray back in and watched the movie to the end.  Along the way, there were some scenes that showed remarkable detail.  Strangely, these were often indoor shots (the outdoor shots were often the grainiest for some reason).  The effect of these good scenes was maddening, however, because it made the return to grainy scenes all the more noticeable.  It gave you a sense for what this transfer could have been.<br /><br />If you already own the DVD of this film, it is not worth upgrading to blu-ray.  Perhaps MGM will come out with a better transfer in the future for this otherwise good movie.  It deserves better.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|This time the movie is how Sly visioned it. More character developement, plot holes filled up and a much better movie.  Not that the original was bad but this one is much better fleshed out with all involved...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|When I'm not in the mood for something intense or super challenging, this is just the thing. A little pressure to beat the clock, but not so hard you get stuck.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book for couples and for for singles too. He gives such helpful information and insight on relationships concerning how to show love and what you need to feel loved. I have been married for over 20 years and we now are trying to implement these theories into our marriage and find it is very helpful to our relationship. Even if your happily married its still so helpful!! Thank you Gary Chapman!!!:)<br /><br />tbell
B0094OLFUW|3.0|I like some songs in this album, particularly Sunset and Angel but the sound is definitely different from their previous debut. I couldn't get into most of their other songs so I'm a bit disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The mobile website always drained my battery, but the app is much better. It's almost as nice as the regular website!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At the time of this review, there were 2,192 reviews, 1,902 of which were 5 stars. There's a reason why 90% of readers gave this story a 5-star review - it's a seamless and beautiful read that belongs in the Norton Anthology of Science Fiction. In the short amount of time, the author tells a complete and rich story with strong character development and a clever plot. He knows exactly what details are critical to progressing the story and which ones would only fluff up the word count. And he even manages to pull off an elegant ending.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B0091REZMW|3.0|I WOULD LOVE THIS GAME IF THE DIAMONDS COULD BE EARNED INSTEAD OF REQUIRING MONEY, OR IF THE ROOMS NEEDED LESS ENERGY. OTHERWISE I QUITE ENJOY THE GAME.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A great game which adds a twist to the match three type games. It combines just the right amount of luck and strategy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved all three books. This one was tragic and sad but, PLEASE DO NOT SKIP IT! All three are must reads.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|I am now a huge fan! Come Away With Me is such a great song! I can play it over and over and not get tired of it! She has such an incredible voice. I also love the fact that I can listen to the songs before purchasing them. What a great feature.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|My 8 year old finds it fun, but abit to easy, still a fun way to pass the time playing
B000002KE2|4.0|This is great album, however, this cd was not remastered as well as it it could have been, still like though.
B0035V35PI|5.0|If you love ninja's and/or martial arts movies you've probably seen this. If for some reason you missed it watch it now. I can say little that the other 165 reviews haven't said. The movie is solid Sho Kosugi makes a return to the genre and Rain makes the best ninja we've seen yet on the big screen. I am like many others I'm not sure what else this movie could offer that isn't here. Awesome back story, exciting fight scenes with choreography that blows away most action movies and a protagonist that you do care about. While this isn't a long review don't take that as a short coming of the movie, it has lots of content and action to keep you happy.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|My only issue with this format of the bluray was the music.  It does NOT come on a disc.  Rather, it is downloadable only.  This is a real turn off.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|The movie is a bit complicated the first time around.  It was easier to follow the second time, especially after researching it on the web.  A lot of references that would go unnoticed by most people.  Good sci-fi though.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I had seen the movie Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and so bought the book.  I didn't know that it was book I of a trilogy. I did like the trilogy, but I thought the second book ended abruptly. It was interesting that at the end of the third book, you find out that the author died shortly after submitting the manuscripts for the trilogy. So as the reader, you wonder if there's more truth than fiction to the story that you just read. :)
B005UDD1R6|2.0|completely worthless. can't play .flv,  crashes when attempting vitamio install, and will not read from sd card. the interface is nice, but that is really the only strongpoint.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is a lot of fun and when I get bored I play this game. I love find and seek games
0062060562|4.0|Christine wakes up every morning not knowing who she is. She couldn't tell you where she's living, what year it is, and doesn't know the man claiming to be her husband. He tells her she suffered an accident that rendered her brain incapable of recalling past memories and retaining new ones. She can only remember what happens within one day, until she falls asleep. While she dreams, her memory resets itself, wiping the slate clean. She doesn't know who to trust, when she can't even trust her own mind to give her the truth, and piecing together the reality of Christine's life feels insurmountable. Until she finds her journal.<br /><br />I really love the this book is written, the immediacy of the language. Never has first person present tense felt more appropriate. Christine lives in the moment; she has nothing of her past, nothing concrete at all, and her future will forever and always be a mystery because she'll never be able to build any kind of path of experience to lead to it. I cringed in sympathy at Christine's horror when, convinced she is in her twenties, she goes to the mirror to find a body heading for old age. Christine's mind has robbed her of the prime of her life; there are some days she wakes up with only the faint memories of being a child. The dull dread of reliving that same horror every day, with no way of actually recalling that these days even happened and will occur, is a giant, white elephant parking its rear in the center of her thoughts all the time.<br /><br />Christine has no choice but to hope the people around her have the best intentions, because she doesn't know any of them. And by any of them, I mean all of two people. Dr. Nash may be the only person Christine can trust, only because of the presence of the journal he told her to start, to help keep track of her days and trigger memories. His genuine effort to help Christine is sweet, and she clings to his presence like a buoy in an ocean, but even this is suspect: why is he going to these lengths? And Ben. She knows, unnervingly, that she cannot function away from her husband because of the reboot every morning. If Ben wasn't there to clue her in, if Christine never kept a record of her days, she would be lost forever, completely at the mercy of her ravaged mind. What she begins to uncover, however, proves that some nasty shadows lurk about in her life - and Ben sidesteps the truth more often than not.<br /><br />I was suspicious of everything for Christine's sake. Oh, the wedding photos were burned in a house fire, Ben? There are no pictures for Chris to look at? Her parents are dead? Where are her friends? Does this doctor have totally good intentions? Why is Ben lying to her? Why, on the first page of her journal, does she put this reminder: Don't Trust Ben?<br /><br />Every weird clue or lie I jumped on and analyzed, piled it on the growing mountain of That Seems Shady, Ben. I wanted Christine to find answers, I wanted her memory to return - I cheered whenever she remembered anything at all from her past. As her true past slowly started to reveal itself, it just grew more awful, like pulling back layers of old kitchen floor and tile and finding more rot underneath.<br /><br />The fact that a huge chunk of the novel is just her reading the diary of the days leading up to the present day doesn't hinder the story at all. I forgot that the entire novel basically occurs over the course of one day, because I was so absorbed. Each day she learns something new, either from Dr. Nash, Ben, or her own fickle mind. She is so isolated that when she finally connects with her only friend, I got a little choked up. How often we take our friends' presence for granted. What a huge part of our lives they are, in the memories they help make, their laughter and advice and companionship. The absence of such a confidante is keenly felt, and I ached for Christine. Chris is like a prisoner in her home, with a warden that is never really truthful, for Her Own Sake, and she feels indebted to him for his patience, his love, his willingness to rehearse the same play every single morning to tell Christine who she is and why she's there. I was afraid for her, anxious, and the suspense over what she would discover about herself and her life just oozed over every page.<br /><br />S.J. Watson managed to make a woman reading her diary nerve-wracking, y'all.<br /><br />At the climax of the novel, there is a scene involving her journal that wrecked me almost as bad as it did Christine. I experience moments of sheer panic whenever something weird happens to my laptop, and I have that flash of losing everything I've written and the thought of it is devastating. How would it feel to lose writing that told me who I am, that acted as my lifeline creating a life that existed beyond one day at a time with no other connection to each new day?<br /><br />The only qualms I had with the story concerned the ending and the big reveal. It's almost too farfetched, almost a little too hard to swallow. At the very least, it hadn't gone on very long - a month or two, if I recall correctly. I was simultaneously satisfied and dissatisfied with the ending. I liked the note it finished off with, but the finale was so rushed, and I craved to read more about Christine interacting with two particular people.<br /><br />Beyond that, I flat adored this novel.
B0061S073A|5.0|My son loves this app. I love that he can play and I don't have to worry about him getting into anything he shouldn't. Easy to use for both of us (him for playing me for changing apps etc). A must have for anyones kindle (if they have kids using the kindle).
B008NW67E0|5.0|While \\"Sigh No More\\" took some time to get into because Mumford falls into that \\"all their songs sound the same\\" category, \\"Babel\\" is more easily accessible. Mumford & Sons' last studio album, \\"Sigh No More\\", has more single songs that pack an infectious wallop; however, it is \\"Babel\\" that provides longer-term consistency. What I especially like is the very minimal gap between songs which makes the album seem like a musical journey rather than a collection of songs. Single \\"I Will Wait\\" is the standout, especially with its crescendo of \\"Raise my hands / Paint my spirit gold / And bow my head / Feel my heart slow\\". The themes of light, darkness, heart, and colors play across the songs and tie them together well. The \\"paint my spirit gold\\" lyric from \\"I Will Wait\\" is one example of the wonderful imagery painted on this album. The album peaks in the middle with pace-changer \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\" which also builds to a sublime bridge of \\"But hold me still bury my heart on the cold / And hold me still bury my heart on the cold\\" which alone almost makes the price of the album worth it. Follow-up track \\"Lover of the Light\\" is Mumford at their best -- driving songs of love, desire, and mistakes made all sung with such passion that it makes you want to start the album over again once it ends.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Take the Hunger Games[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]] smash it together with some Tron [[ASIN:B004KPLVW2 Tron: The Original Classic (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]] and a bit of Indiana Jones treasure adventure.[[ASIN:B000NQRE9Q Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures [Blu-ray]]]
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I purposely did not read any in depth reviews about this book to avoid spoilers, so I will not add any here. So Many people had recommended Me Before You that I decided to take a leap of faith and I was so pleased I did! Beautiful, relateable characters you come to love and a simple storyline that becomes more complicated as it goes on (rest assured this is not your usual \\"chick lit\\" ) Certain pages were very difficult to read and I will admit to battling through a few tears. The chapters written from other characters point of view were a welcome change of pace and I think were needed so as the storyline did not become too bogged down. As the pages were counting down I slowed my reading so that I didn't have to leave my \\"friends\\" Lou and Will behind :) First novel in ages I have absolutely loved and I would suggest it goes on everyone's must read list!
1451662432|2.0|It's almost as if the book's written w/ an austrian accent.<br /><br />the guy is unreal; probably the most driven guy you'll know. but the book's quite silly.<br /><br />Support  your local library!

B0097EWK3A|3.0|I love Big Fish Games and have played this title on PC and throughout enjoyed it. However right now I am stuck in the farmhouse/trailer. The last item on my hidden object list is a boomerang, and I've found it, the hint has confirmed that I've found it, but no matter where I click, it won't select it. If someone could update this glitch so I can finish I will happily give this game the 5 stars it deserves.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great read for anyone but I highly recommend it for your.teenager or middle school student. The author does a great job of taking you inside the world of a boy whose outer deformity cannot hide his inner beauty.
B00304VVII|5.0|This movie was amazing and did justice to the Halo series. It makes me want to see more, wait, a lot more of Halo!

B008XG1X18|5.0|no issues with this app. easy to access account<br /> easy to sync. it is great to search and via pins.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|If you enjoy a story being told to you and not shoved down your throat, this is your movie.  Obviously an excellent cast who know their craft.  You see the characters not the actors.
B004G600A4|3.0|This movie has some good Disney things to it, and some things that need improvement. My biggest problem with the movie is the villain, Mother Gothel. She's Frollo all over agin, although I don't think she's as bad as someone like Frollo. She is a little more humorous. Also, I don't like how the king and queen don't search for Rapunzel for all these years. I also wish there were more animal side characters. Pascal is cool, and Maximus is funny, but he's Flynn Rider's enemy until the end. The song \\"Mother Knows Best\\" is mediocre. I can't even remember the melody! I also think the climax is one of Disney's weakest. Okay, I've complained about \\"Tangled\\" enough. What DO I like about this movie. The Pub Thugs are the funniest in this film, as well as their song \\"I've Got A Dream\\". Flynn and Maximus's slapstick comedy relationship IS hilarious, the main characters are funny, likable, and have good looks. I also like how the lantern song sequence is a combination of \\"Kiss the Girl\\", Beauty and the Beast\\", and \\"A Whole New World\\". It's just so beautiful. Overall, I think \\"Tangled\\" is okay. I don't think it's a movie I'll be watching over and over again, but I respect the good stuff for what they are.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Super 8 is a lovely family film.  It's a throw back to 80s family films, reminiscent of Goonies and E.T.
0140544518|5.0|I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a game one can get into. I have to give it a 10+. I am so impresses I will go out of my way to find game like this for my computer.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|This is the most encouraging and bravest movie in my life.<br />Even when I am profoundly disappointed, It always gives me power to get back.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|I was really excited when the package came earlier than expected, and it was all bundled together like this. HOWEVER, about 90% of the discs are scratched, and two of the boxes were broken. Not to mention the fact that Season 2 and 3 were both missing a disc altogether. For something advertised as new, it definitely isn't, and for this price it should be. This is unacceptable and I will be reporting it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm a long time fan. Its easy to use and share. Great for researching creative projects or sharing notes with friends.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I loved playing angry birds but this is just 10 times better this is your best game yet Rovio but it is a bit glitchy and slow but none the less a great game
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Really well done, and pretty novel in the sense that it wasn't the usual vampire gore movie.  Certainly had some of that, but was more about the relationship between the boy and the vampire.  Definitely recommend!
B0020BUWX2|4.0|a must read! only thing i would change is, right when the story really grabs your attention, it goes to a flashback. this happened alot during the book, and those were the only boring parts. other that, it was a major page turner. read it in 2days. worth the time and money :D
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was a great read, and touched my heart on a personal level. Many people I know who read this book often say they don't understand why Emily Gold committed suicide, but having been in that situation myself I perfectly understood. Mentally, she found suicide to be the best option, because when you are so tired on that level, even if visibly everything seems fine, you try your bewst to preserve the good, and that's what she wanted. To preserve the good.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult did a beautiful job, and it was amazing and gripping from beginning to end. And I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is not only romance, but it shows how a perfect life can have its flaws and how easy it is to lose everything.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Beautiful words, believable characters, and a fantastic story! I absolutely fell in love with this book and ended up reading it (and all the others in the series) within a two week period! I have recommended it to many friends and coworkers. Love, romance, mystery, in a historical setting....everything you could ask for!
1612933068|3.0|I read this book a long time ago and found it very helpful, however this publication had several errors in spelling or use of the wrong word. Also it was not divided into chapters which I believe to be helpful. The original was.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This film has a slick, polished look that differs greatly from the \\"shaky cam\\" or \\"found film\\" branch of the horror genre that likely provided its heaviest influences. It plays like an offshoot of that tradition mixed with elements of kaidan inspired Japanese horror cinema. The cast performances are all handled pretty well, although one might find a handful of scenes a bit over-acted. There are a couple of well-placed and timed shocks. However, overall I found I was increasingly bored by this film. It didn't really break any new ground or try anything very innovative. Some of the background music meant to add dark, creepy undertones was, I thought, increasingly distracting. Make-up and special effects sometimes looked like, well, make-up and special effects. I never felt much of a connection to the characters. For example, Juliet Rylance's character just seemed to appear on screen to yell and argue - albeit with good reason - but she is so poorly conceived as a character she doesn't really generate any sympathy. Ethan Hawke's character lends itself to a disparate comparison to Gregory Peck in The Omen - a driven male lead who, through his own misguided efforts, lands the family in a mess. However, where Peck drew you in and built sympathy for his character and situation, Hawke's character, similar to Rylance's, doesn't generate much sympathy. That ultimately means many viewers will stop caring what happens to him. A couple of other characters felt the same way, and two lesser roles were developed in a stereotypical manner. Hokey or stereotyped characters can work in a tongue-in-cheek film, but this movie seems to be trying very hard to be taken seriously. This adds to an overarching feeling that it all just doesn't come together very well.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the relatively positive critical reviews, but ultimately found little to recommend. If you are undecided, wait for the DVD or Blu-ray release. Much of the film is very dark (too dark, in my opinion) and shot in enclosed interiors. There is nothing that benefits from viewing on the big screen. Younger viewers with little exposure to the genre's long history or those who like predictable, cookie cutter entertainment may find this film enjoyable. I could probably justify giving Sinister two and a half stars out of five, but three just doesn't seem applicable.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|so yeah I heard that you have to pay to get the points. BUT you can also get them FREE, you just need to have patience. if you have Internet connection you are able to get free money or points once per day. it isn't a lot but if you save up its worth it!<br />aside from that the game overall is really fun. in the beginning it crashed like twice and had shut down the kindle and I was like O_O . but after a while it doesn't do that anymore and it was alllll great :)<br />the game though is realllllllly fast~~!!!! to get past the higher levels you need to get more workers in your cafe!  (which will be easy after reading my 1st paragraph)  xD<br />this game is so cute and fun and I love Hello Kitty so this is real great for me.<br />^^
B007CKNX28|5.0|I'm not a Jack White fan, but I love this album. I hear a strong Led Zeppelin influence in many of the songs, vocally and instrumentally. He says it's all him, but his time spent with Jimmy Page making, \\"It Might Get Loud\\" has had a profound influence on him whether he realizes it or not.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is easy yet challenging at the same time.  Love all the quests. Definetly a game I would play over n over again. only problem is the special codes wont work on my kindle fire. that's aggravating
0446580848|2.0|Time for Det. Corey to retire. The wisecracks are tiring, and the end game is trite. Once my favorite fictional character, he is now just a blowhard. The speech before the final payback was so lame it was sad. Enjoy your beach house in Long Island, but start packing now.
B005OP7162|5.0|This show gets you hooked for more. Always new twists and turns. You will get emotionally involved before you know it. You will look forward to each new episode.

B009C5Z112|5.0|It has been a long long wait between Wintersun's debut self titled album and Time I.  Many fans would write off a band that takes 5+ years to followup an album.  Listening to Time I, I now understand why Jari spent so many painstaking years writing the music.<br /><br />Time I is brilliant.  The music is carefully crafted from the opening track to the end.  Epic in scope, the production is over the top.  A blend of acoustic, synth, bombastic vocals and guitar harmonies, Time I is what fans loved from the first album.  When track 2, 'Sons of Winter and Stars' opens, fans of Wintersun know Jari is back and back in a big way.<br /><br />Time I is a natural progression from the first album.  Infused with Jari's fantastic vocals and fluid guitarwork, fans won't be disappointed in anything except the length.  As others have mentioned the listening experience flys by so fast it leaves the listener wanting more.  After all it's been such a long wait.  Hopefully the material for Time II is not too far off and we get another Wintersun album within a year.<br /><br />I can't wait.
B001HN697M|4.0|Underworld was a great film, I thought. The second one, not so much. I did enjoy this one,though. It details the history of the vampires and lycans, the feud that began between them, and how it began. It has great special effects with a passable story. There are holes in it, but it is interesting. It is a quick moving film. One minute you begin the film, then you are at the end. If you are a fan of the Underworld saga, this is a great one to view and/or add to your collection. In this film, everything from the first two films comes around into a circle and to an end.
0767821629|5.0|Yeah there are comparison of this movie to The Matrix and Tron but The Thirteenth Floor holds its own. The only reason this movie would have scored less at the box office is due to marketing but marketing often oversells movies and leaves the viewer wishing for his money back, and 13th Floor left the judgement of the viewer up to the viewer based on the merits of the movie and not the sell campaign or how many times the story can be resold. A good burger at some mom and pop shop does not need marketing to make it any better than what you can get at a national chain it is just simply better. The Thirteenth Floor is in my opinion better than Matrix simply because the acting is not so stylized. As for a comparison to Tron that I heard, Tron has no comparisons as far as I am concerned but the inhabitability of the CG character by its user is defiantly reminiscent of Tron. The Thirteenth Floor is a really good movie but if you are looking for something similar to The Matrix then watch The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, or The Matrix Animatrix. But, if you want a stand alone good movie then The Thirteenth Floor is a good pick.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Reviewing the streaming rental: Very pretty movie. However, the technical details will soon have you screaming at the screen. The \\"scientists\\" are complete idiots. It might be worth waiting for a director's cut. There are some strange plot jumps that make it hard to keep up in a couple places, despite the fact the plot is mind-numbingly predictable. Possible side effects: echos of Alien may cause mild groaning.<br /><br />Worth a rental, but don't expect to be able to take it very seriously.

B000W93CHC|1.0|Set in Medieval times, centering on building of a cathedral, the characters are okay, but I con't understand why he didn't kill off the villain by the end of the first book unless he just wanted to do a sequel. You will find the story matter similar, much better characters and much better writing in The Heaven Tree Trilogy by Ellis Peters aka Edith Pargeter, author of the Brother Caedfael series. Peters is a master storyteller,  her prose almost begs to be read aloud, and she knows the historical period well.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This movie does a great job of conveying the grittiness and darkness of the original graphic novel.  At the same time it cuts out all the cultural references to the 1980's without butchering the story.  The only thing that I did not like was the studio breaking the movie into two parts.  However, I rather have two good films than one cut down awful one.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|After reading Pat Baker's Regeneration and 2 subsequent works in the trilogy, (all about WWI) this book is just so shallow and predictable, I put out down halfway through. It is long, but not much depth but at least provides some historical perspective for those who enjoy light reading.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Amy Dunne disappears on the morning of her fifth anniversary of her marriage to Nick Dunne.  He is immediately suspected by the police and Nick begins to learn things about his wife from friends he didn't know she had and struggles to prove his innocence.  What follows is a chronicle by both Nick and Amy of their relationship from their first meeting up to the present, as well as the search to discover what happened to Amy.<br /><br />It is a very rare thing for me to enjoy a book when I don't like most of the characters.  I must credit the author for being able to engage me emotionally and keep me glued to a story where so many of the people are just distasteful.  I also bounced back and forth as to what happened to Amy, transferring allegiance to her, then Nick, then back to her....well, you get the picture. In the end, I struggled to define which I disliked the most.<br /><br />This is a story of two very complicated people, their marriage and relationships with others and how it shaped their own marital relationship.  Some will find the ending unsatisfying but for me, it was the only one that would ever make sense.  I'd describe this as a contemporary fiction with a mystery so as to not mislead one into thinking it's all about the disappearance of Amy.  That's important but there is so much more to the story.  I guarantee you won't be ambivalent about this book when you're done.

B00846REIS|4.0|Eva Tramell moves to New York to start a new job for an advertising agency.  The day before she's scheduled to start, she decides to do a dry run to the office to ensure she won't be late and everything will go smoothly. When she comes to the assistance of a woman who's dropped the contents of her bag, she looks right into the eyes of Gideon Cross and the immediate attraction is almost palpable for both of them.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon are both pretty interesting individually and as a couple.  While he is mega-wealthy, she comes from a comfortable background, which puts them on equal footing of a sort.  Both have tragic circumstances that have shaped who they are but Eva seems to have dealt with her demons more than he. Eva tries her best to resist him but Gideon is determined to have her be a part of his life.<br /><br />Many comparisons have been made between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey.  While there are some obvious comparisons (wealthy hero who is a bit damaged, young woman who is captivated by him), these are two completely different stories, in my opinion, that stand on their own.  Those who resented the virginal character in Fifty Shades will appreciate the stronger willed, experienced Eva. However, I firmly believe the two books should be evaluated on their own merits and not comparatively.<br /><br />While I liked Eva and Gideon's story, theirs was one almost overwhelmed by their sexual attraction with a lot of emphasis on the sex. Even though she appeared to be the most stable of the two, her constant running away was extremely tiresome (she redeems herself by at least acknowledging it).  We know that Gideon has issues but aren't certain of the source. Near the end we are introduced to some startling revelations that, of course, has me ready to jump right into the next book.<br /><br />I think this story stands on its own, no matter what your opinion of Fifty Shades of Grey.  Enjoy it for the relationship between Eva and Gideon and how they're learning to find their own way.  Be forewarned that it is sexually explicit and there's a lot of it.  Not a bad thing, just the reality. I'm hooked and will definitely be reading the next book.rning to find their own way.  Be forewarned that it is sexually explicit and there's a lot of it.

B000002H97|4.0|This is probably the album where Metallica sold out. Six songs had videos on MTV and were played ad nauseum on the radio. The other songs are pretty much filler. The album ends with a wimper. Overall, though, it's probably the last decent Metallica album. Right after this, they sold out BIG-TIME!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the hunger games. Awesome story! Really impossible to put down til the finish. Look forward to the mocking jay.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I would have given it five stars but for a relatively old fossil like myself, I think this was a concert to heavily promote Pink Floyd's last two studio albums, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell\\", which were the two Pink Floyd albums that Roger Waters had no part in. Other than this concerts opening track \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" the whole first hour seemed to just be committed to their last two albums.  Which is fine, I guess, because I really like the tracks \\"Sorrow\\" and especially \\"High Hopes\\", but they skipped alot of the important songs from \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". Like \\"One Slip\\" and \\"Dogs of War\\".<br /><br />Anyway, I wanted more of the earlier Floyd. It was great though, that DVD One ended with \\"One of These Days\\" from 1971's \\"Meddle\\" album.<br /><br />But, this concert really improved when we got on to DVD Two since they played the entire \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" album.  That is definitely the highlight of this whole concert.  Visuals and all.<br /><br />But, the video and the sound quality is pretty good here.  I think it would be really cool if they re-issued this concert as a 3D Blu-Ray concert. But, I think the DVD is just fine.<br /><br />I can watch this concert on any given evening after work.  Enjoy it with a cold beer and a bass intensive sound system. I generally do.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|The movie was obiously previously viewed as it had spots where it would freeze and cut off. I was very disappointed.
B009B53LA6|5.0|No Doubt's back after what seemed like forever. After 2001′s Rock Steady, ND went on a hiatus for many different reasons, but mainly because lead singer Gwen Stefani wanted to focus on her solo career which gave us hits like 2005′s Hollaback Girl and 2006′s Sweet Escape. Regardless, they're now back and they just released a brand new album entitled \\"Push and Shove\\" on Interscope Records.<br />So let's get to it!<br /><br />The album opens up with the mysterious intro of the albums first single: Settle Down. It's a song similar to what we got in Rock Steady where the beats and instruments give off a Jamaican/Dancehall vibe while Gwen's vocals attempt to blur the line between her early Ska days with the recent Dancehall feel. The song uses a surprising amount of 808 drums which I haven't heard on a No Doubt song since the B-side \\"Leftovers\\"...and even then it was used sparingly (they might of used it in more recent songs, but I can't think of any at the moment).<br /><br />Nevertheless, Settle Down is a straight up GOOD track that is deserving of the first track of a comeback album. Gwen's vocals harken back to the Tragic Kingdom days while all the instruments deliver a modern sounding Dancehall feel, as stated before.<br /><br />The rest of the album is just as catchy, with it's fair share of slower songs during the second half of the album. The bands next single - \\"Looking Hot\\" is an amazing song. It's what I was hoping the entire album would be like! The chorus and verses harken back to the Tragic Kingdom days while the bridge brings it back to the Rock Steady days. Gwen's vocals sounds really on the spot with this song. Just a really great track overall and maybe even slightly better than Settle Down.<br /><br />I was never a fan of the slower songs from, well, any band really, but especially No Doubt. Only a few slower songs are good, such as Panic, Leftovers, Don't Speak, Simple Kind of Life, Running, etc. but some of the slower songs off this new album might rank up there with those classics. Songs like One More Summer, Heaven, and Gravity are really, really good for slow songs as they're not too slow to be boring, or too fast to be muddled in with the rest of the album.<br /><br />But, of course, there's one song that took me a while to like. I've come to appreciate \\"Push and Shove\\" a lot more since I originally listened to the album. It's a nice texture of fast paced dancehall dub with a bit of Rock Steady melodies thrown in for added spice. One of my more favorite tracks of the album!<br /><br />But other than that, the rest of the songs (Easy, Undercover, Undone, Sparkle, and the final track, Dreaming the Same Dream) are all very good songs, with Adrian's drumming excelling in Dreaming the Same Dream, in my opinion.<br /><br />So is this a worthwhile purchase for both new comers to No Doubt and the veterans of the band? I say yes. Most defiantly. There really isn't a bad song on this album and while the production could be a little better (especially the drums), the album is a wonderful comeback album for No Doubt. The album is almost like a hybrid between Rock Steady and Tragic Kingdom/Return of Saturn and you should defiantly not overlook it if you're looking for catchy songs.ght rank up there with those classics.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|AMAZING SERIES and OUTSTANDING FOLLOW-UP. I absolutely cannot wait to pick up the final installment of the series! Sylvia Day is an amazing writer who has me swept off my feet and engulfed in Eva and Gideon's love affair! I'm super in love with Gideon.<br /><br />Personally I don't get the 50 Shades comparison, this book is worlds more sophisticated and the characters have a lot more depth. Sylvia Day- thank you for writing this series- you seriously have me hoping, wishing and waiting to meet my own Gideon Cross!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.: I wonder where she will take this book in book 3? I did keep thinking with all the description of Eva eating that she was pregnant, and with all the \\"fluid\\" description also... so idk.
1451620829|1.0|I laugh at all the numbnuts jumping to believe the spewed out lies of an angry old man that has been let go from this band 3 times. He threw Ace under the bus, WHY? All because Ace voted to kick him out of the band when he was too f'ed up to continue ? Because Ace wanted a better drummer for the Comet, so he never offered him the job?<br /><br />Lydia Criss said it best in a recent interview,if he's talking he's lying. Sure every member of this band has a problem with their version of the truth and work for money. Funny thing is, so does every band on the planet. Like every other KISS book on the market, this is the truth as seen through, in this case Peter's distorted drug viewed past \\"Peter Criss was the star of the band tinted glasses\\". To believe him , you have to believe that everything in this mans life is always someone else's fault.<br /><br />I really found the claims that his failure of a solo career was held back by the band or the label, Until the mid to late 80's KISS was still split 4 ways, Peter and Ace were still getting their check. Gene and Paul would have gotten their 25% of whatever the other 2 did. That's why Ace waited till later with the Comet, where the other 3 didn't get any.Ace/Paul/ Gene all got their $$$$ from Peter's first 2 solo albums.More sales equal more $$$$.

From his early life, to the formation of Sabbath, to current day Ozzy doesnt hold back and tells so much of his life story. It really leaves you wanting more.

B006GHA9QQ|3.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber has out done himself in composing some of his most beautiful, melodic and passionate music.  Unfortunately he has combined it with his absolute worst.<br />Moving the continuation of his original plot to Coney Island from Paris cheapens the story and the production.<br />All of the performers are excellent but the singer/actor Ben Lewis is outstanding in every way.<br />This work could succeed on the world stage by jettissoning the extraneous plot complications----particularly the vulgar, hideous scenes of the Coney Island shows!!

0061120073|5.0|I would love to teach a literature class on historical fiction that was actually written a long time ago. It's so interesting to see how writers from a particular period saw an era that came before them.<br />For example, The Last of the Mohicans was written in 1826, but takes place in the 1750s. To Kill A Mockingbird was written during the Civil Rights Movement, but takes place in the Depression. And now, I just finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. It's a great book that holds up incredibly well, but one of my favorite things is how the novel is a view of life in 1912 that's written from the perspective of someone in 1947. You can see both eras--the one being written about as well as the beliefs of the writer who came later.<br />This novel is an absolute work of genius. It's completely addictive, beautifully written, funny and sad. The characters are so real that I felt as if I knew them, and while they don't always do what's right, they are heartbreakingly human and vulnerable. A truly fantastic read.

B005FPT51K|3.0|I had to have this. I saw it at the Apple store about a week after I found out I was pregnant and knew I would register for it just like I HAD to register for a Kitchenaid mixer as soon as I was engaged... It works. Usually. I like taking screen shots and I like that it one tap zooms. It's VERY easy to move the camera and has great display - and there are 4 of us in my house with iPhones and 2 of us with iPads so everyone can easily connect and stalk the baby. Problem is, if your wifi sucks, this product sucks. It loses connection even when WiFi doesn't suck. I'm not thrilled with the settings for movement/sound. I put it on 2 for sound alerts and a door shutting ACROSS the house will make it go off but the baby has to be crying decently to get it to go off. It was confusing to set up but still be able to unplug from internet directly. The actual instructions/app functionality is rudimentary at best. The app itself is where this EXPENSIVE product falls short. I didn't have any problems with I updated my OS6 like many complained of but I wish I had done more research into video monitors instead of blindly deciding that this Apple app product was the one I had to have. I hope something new comes out to compete with it's crappy app software.

1451695195|5.0|Years, ago, a linguistics professor in graduate school said something that stopped me in my tracks: He said, \\"No neurosurgeon has ever opened up someone's brain and found letters or words floating around in there.\\" In other words, science knows what parts of the brain are associated with language, especially when they are malfunctioning, but it cannot explain how those firing synapses in our brains create that miraculous phenomenon we call \\"language\\".  Similarly, Dr. Alexander discusses how science has not yet solved the mystery of human consciousness.  He writes, \\"There is nothing about the physics of the material world (quarks, electrons, photons, atoms) and specifically the intricate structure of the brain, that gives the slightest clue as the mechanism of consciousness.  In fact, the greatest clue to the reality of the spiritual realm is this profound mystery of our conscious existence.\\"  I also agree with his statement that \\"The ascendance of the scientific method based solely on the physical realm. . . presents a major problem.  We have lost touch with the deep mystery at the center of our existence---our consciousness. . . it was lost to our secular Western culture as we became increasingly enamored with the power of modern science and technology.\\"  I liked how Dr. Alexander discusses his NDE from the point of view of a doctor and scientist, and objectively explores different possible explanations for having consciousness----when the consciousness-generating portion of his brain had shut down.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've been a devoted fan of DeMille ever since Word of Honor appeared on my doorstep from the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1987.  A couple of his recent novels have been disappointments, and The Panther is among those.  Unfortunately, DeMille seems to have lost his way.<br /><br />The Panther brings back John Corey and Kate Mayfield, the husband and wife duo from DeMille's previous novels including Plum Island, Nightfall, and The Lion's Game.  This story sends the two to Yemen in the mid 2000's, in pursuit of an Al Qaeda terrorist.  While the concept is a good one and the story had great potential, it is utterly destroyed by the juvenile and inane narrative of John Corey throughout the book.  De Mille obviously believes that the \\"wisecracking\\" Corey is some kind of macho and appealing character, but the stupid and sarcastic jokes that are interjected throughout Corey's narrative continuously (and I do mean continuously - as in, with every thought, several times per page) serve to disrupt the flow of the book - and are just flat-out annoying.  Further, they turn Corey - once presented as an interesting character into the earlier novels - into a silly caricature that is not remotely realistic.  It is really a shame, because the story could have been a winner.  As it was I could hardly read more than a chapter at a time without putting the book down.<br /><br />If you're hoping for the brilliance of some of DeMille's earlier novels, you won't find it here.  While not quite as bad as The Gate House, this is close to being DeMille's most disappointing work.  I hope that John Corey is forever retired, but either way, this is my last John Corey novel for sure - and possibly my last DeMille novel.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|I can't speak for others because personal taste is (well) a personal thing. When I sit down to watch a Transformers movie, I want to see the animated series portrayed as live action. To be certain, this will never win an Academy Award but at the same time, it makes for some good, mindless entertainment. I watched the animated series with my kids as they were growing up and this film (even more than the two proceeding it) was a closer match. Violence, destruction, fights with real anger and venom... those were the elements that marked the series and set it above other American made animation (still a ways to go to match some of the truly great Anime). This film matched the series on every level.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series and don't expect too much stimulating intellectual viewing, this film is for you. After all, Transformers is about the fighting... everything else is just filler.

B002E01MHY|4.0|Filmed at the height of the early '80 slasher craze and released in 1982, \\"The New York Ripper\\" is actually one of the genre's most intelligent, well-written and professional-looking offerings (compared to \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"Slumber Party Massacre\\").<br /><br />Despite the fact that our killer has the bizarre calling card of quacking like a duck when stalking his victims or taunting detective/leading man Jack Hedley on the phone, it doesn't come off as silly as it sounds. There are red herrings aplenty and it wouldn't be inaccurate to label this as one of most misogynyst films I've seen. The victims all have their ladyparts assaulted in the most vicious of ways (although only the razor blade scene made me look away).<br /><br />Lots of location shooting in New York makes one nostalgic for the era (the interiors were filmed in Rome which becomes obvious in some scenes since I've never seen any American homes that resemble the structures we see onscreen).<br /><br />The 2009 widescreen release by Blue Underground looks fantastic but there are several instances where the dialogue seems off from the actors' lips. I'm not sure if it was dubbed or this occured transferring the film elements to DVD. Still, one of the best-looking and well-produced slashers from the era.<br /><br />FOUR STARS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I recommend you to get this game because I have it for my iphone and I know how to change your kindle fire to an android tablet and get you a new appstore and the android locker without roooting email me @dillonthomas0424@gmail.com
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I was looking for a case that was not too thick and heavy for my IPhone 4S and decided to try this one.This is a very nice protective case. It looks good and feels good. I particularly like the screen protector. I doesn't have that sticky feel that most protectors have. It goes on without bubbles and is pretty much invisible. I highly recommend this case.
B00866H7SS|5.0|This is far better than the 50 shades trilogy as it has a more believable storyline, I have also read the following book Reflected by you which continues the story seamlessly and can't wait for the next in the series.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|First of all it arrived on time, in perfect condition. This is a must - have movie DVD. Marvel universe doesn't qualify as movies with great scripts, they are entertaining scripts just as the cartoon is. If you are looking for adult cartoon scripts go and buy the Nole's Batman Saga. This Marvel's The Avengers is a great option for kids and marvel lovers. For the first time you have the opportunity to see on screen and at the same time all the Avengers reunited.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Second in the series following Bared to you. This series has a far better storyline than the 50 Shades trilogy in my opinion and far more palpable characters included rather than just focusing on two.<br />I would definitely recommend this as a better alternative to lovers of 50 Shades.
B008BSPQ3E|3.0|First, I'd like to say that I agree with the view expressed by many fans, who are disappointed by the absence of the related B-sides, 12\\" mixes & CD/cassette single tracks. As for what we are getting in this box set, I can report the following:<br /><br />CD 1: the original \\"So\\" album, remastered, but no bonus tracks.<br />CD 2: \\"So DNA\\". 9 selections(one representing each original album track) in which we get a well-compiled composite following each song from songwriting tapes to rough band demos to more polished attempts. Much of the material is of an acceptable, but fairly low-fidelity nature.<br />CD 3: Live in Athens(Part 1)<br />CD 4: Live in Athens(Part 2)<br />  (The audio only from the video program.Oddly, in this large box set, the running order differs slightly from the Athens CD's included in the 3-disc version, though all the same songs are here. In some ways, the audio-only version of the concert is preferable, because when watching the video version, you'll find yourself watching to figure out when you're hearing Peter Gabriel's live performance, and when you're watching a re-recorded performance dubbed in at a recording studio, something that Peter Gabriel has often had a compulsion to do.<br />DVD 1: The \\"Classic Albums\\" documentary. This documentary, with extensive interviews with Peter Gabriel Manu Katche. Tony Levin and producer Daniel Lanois, is facinating to watch once, but it is unlikely that you'll ever watch it again. Still, it shows that even the album's more commercial songs were constructed by very complex and experimental methods.<br />DVD 2: The \\"Live in Athens\\" video. This is more than just a replacement for the old \\"P.O.V.\\" video. This time, a complete composite(taken from several shows) set has been assembled, so it is much longer than \\"P.O.V.\\" with 4 more songs. This newly restored version is, at least visually, much closer to what audiences saw at the shows, and less gimicky than \\"P.O.V.\\"<br />L.P. 1: The \\"So\\" album<br />L.P. 2: Analternate, previously unreleased mix/version of the Peter Gabriel/Kate Bush duet \\"Don't Give Up\\", and two previously unreleased songs \\"Courage\\" & \\"Sagrada\\"<br /><br />You also get an attractive and informative 12\\" x 12\\" hardcover book. The CD's, DVD's, book & L.P.'s are housed in a sturdy, fabric-covered box.<br /><br />Now the bad news: the first production run of this box set shows shoddy quality control in manufacturing, problems similar to those that affected the first production run of the \\"Pink Floyd-The Dark Side of The Moon\\" Immersion box, and the 71-disc \\"Miles Davis-The Complete Columbia Albums\\" box. For those two box sets, the record companies did the ethical thing and replaced the damaged discs for consumers. It remains to be seen whether the record company that released this Peter Gabriel box will put things right for consumers. For a few days, Amazon.com suspended the sale of this box set, but apparently, they didn't take consumer complaints seriously, and they've now resumed selling it. Simply put, don't expect the four CD's to be in good condition. They'll be scratched, pitted or marred by glue stains. These glue stains are stubbornly stuck. You could dislodge some of them with your fingernail, but that will create new(mild) scratches. I recommend rinsing the playback side under running water, then gently wiping dry with a slightly damp towel.(then repeat this procedure) This should remove the glue stains, though obviously it won't help the scratches and scuffs. Will the discs be playable? Yes, but in a $100 box set, we fans are reasonable to expect the discs in a sealed, new box set to be in clean, new condition.<br /><br />As for the DVD's in my box set, they were in perfect condition. And for you vinyl enthusiasts, you'll want to know how the vinyl records sound. The answer is that the grooves are on-center and the overall sound quality is good, with a sound less bright than the CD edition(so you'll get the analogue \\"warmth\\" that you vinyl revival fad enthusiasts crave), but, though the records are visibly in good condition, there are numerous loud pops, some of them repetitive, despite the absence of any visible damage. The culprit is likely poor quality(or inconsistently blended) vinyl. Care was taken at the mastering stage, but the pressing plant did a poor job. Of the two vinyl records, the 33.3 RPM L.P. is the worse one. The 45 RPM record with the 3 bonus tracks has numerous pops, but they are milder than those on the L.P. . My copy of \\"L.P. 1\\" had a mild(but not audible) warp towards the edge, but when playing Side Two, gravity flattens the record.<br /><br />Don't dispose of the cardboard advertising sheet shrink wrapped with the box. The rear of the sheet has a code number which can be redeemed online for a 24-bit audiophile download of the \\"So\\" album and the 3 previously unreleased tracks. I'm going to wait a few weeks before downloading, because (whether true or not), there have been reports on at least one audio-related website, of some sort of brief glitch in the download. However, the download is the only way to get a crackle-free version of what are otherwise the 3 vinyl-only previously unreleased tracks.(UPDATE:I've now downloaded the 48Khz/24-bit version and burned it to DVD-R.  I don't hear any glitches, except the noise on the first piano note of the alternate[bonus track] version of \\"Don't Give Up\\", but that \\"glitch\\", if it is a glitch, is also there when this performance appears on the 3-song/45 RPM vinyl record in the box set. That noise may be an imperfection in the original master tape.)<br /><br />This box set could have been better in so many ways. The manufacturing defects certainly don't help. And while the audio & video quality of the \\"Live In Athens\\" DVD are certainly excellent, many of us would have preferred the superior audio & video quality of Blu-Ray.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Many people will tell you this is a poor movie, because of stupid decisions the characters made. Most of them didn't fully understand what happened i.e they are wondering why someone in the ship can't help someone in the structure outside find their way out, which was explained in the line \\"...signals have been sporadic...\\" from the storm. Don't give in to those false reviews, everything made sense, some of the information isn't given in the movie but in promotional materials as well.

0525953728|5.0|This was a well  written book I'm not sure why all  the hype was about him giving secrets of what the seals do bc he didn't everyone needs to back off<br />The only person who gave secrets was the White House if your going to make a mission quiet, then don't boost about it when these guys get back. These men know how to  Keep quite. there were leaks all over the whitehouse including your president making himself look good and taking all the credit.<br />These missions should be handled within<br />the military only. let them do their job and all others get the hell out. If you want to become part of the mission then sign up for the Military  but the problem there is most could not make the SEALS  so therefore you try to live your lives through them.<br />People need to Learn to shut up and stay out of these missions. Some<br />Of these guys have  families that they want to come home to. but idiots in Washington  need to stay the hell out of boosting when the men come home.  stay quiet. Your egos are going to get these guys killed.<br />If they would like gear down and relax, ask what they would like to do for some r and r off base some where else .<br />You see I come from a long line of military families and I know how it plays on there minds. Congress and the Whitehouse need to take a step back.  Do what's good for these men bc you give them a mission but when they return, they go through hell with you want fry one of the SEALS. But you are wrong.  These guys are dedicated with their lives and they love America. No mission goes down like clock work without difficulties. I love my country and all these men bc you see I too have a son in the Navy who works closely with SEALS on  missions. I thank God everyday for returning them home safe but the media and Washington need keep silent. Obama needs to be a President and  not a kid in the candy store and quit trying to destroy the USA.<br />After reading this book this SEAL author let no secrets out. The Whitehouse disclosed secret information. Everyone needs to stay out if it . Let the military do there jobs because they are good at It and protect us.<br />The big thing that disturbs me is seeing YOUR President constantly using the  Whitehouse for going on vacations. This makes me sick. It is disrespectful. These men are  fighting senseless wars and loosing there lives , limbs and etc. and know one cares. I remember when  my brother returned and thank goodness he was whole and nothing  physically missing, but what you don't see is the mental hurt. I love these guys who run these missions. They are the finest there are and that includes my son. When they are running missions like this we have no idea where they are going or for how long. as a Mother, I wait for his calls because I know he is alive and well. You have no idea unless you have been and and walked in our shoes. we love our county and all It stands for. Obama is not only a horrible President, but to call in Commander In Chief is ridiculous. He has no clue. Support our troops. Just look back at all of the countries we have aided. They really don't care because they will turn on the USA in a flash.<br /><br />From a mother who cares

Other than that, the graphics and game play are well designed.

1451627289|5.0|I haven't picked up a Stephen King novel in years; just haven't been in the mood for horror. I took a chance on 11/22/63 because the premise intrigued me, and I was captivated.<br /><br />While the story details horrific events, both intimate and world-changing, I wouldn't call this a horror novel. There is a sweetness about King's voice in this book that reminded me of his nostalgic short piece, \\"Stand By Me.\\"<br /><br />The protagonist/narrator is the kind of character that Stephen King brings to life with such a deft hand: an ordinary man faced with bewildering circumstances that cannot help but transform him, for better or worse. Jake/George is Stephen King's Frodo Baggins: a reluctant hero, handed unimaginable power and all the temptations that power entails. Like Frodo, he navigates his path with terrible grace.<br /><br />\\"Hearts don't really break,\\" Jake tells us, \\"If only they could.\\"<br /><br />If only.<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen King, for a moving, magical read. I didn't want it to end.

B005S9ELM6|4.0|\\"Argo\\" (2012 release; 120 min.) bring the story, based on true events but fictionalized for Hollywood purposes, of how CIA operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) goes to Iran to help rescue 6 Americans who are holed up in the Canadian Ambassador's residence ever since Iranian fanatics violently took over the US Embassy compound. In order to get the 6 Americans out of Iran, Mendez proposes that they pose as Canadian film makers, who are in Iran scouting for appropriate locations to film Argo, a Star Wars-like adventure. When the various options and alternatives (foreign teachers? agriculture specialists? no, film makers!) are presented to US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, he looks incredulous, but when reassured about the various options available that \\"they are all bad ideas. but this is the BEST bad idea we have\\", Vance blesses the mission. In order to lend credibility to the idea that he is involved with this fake movie, Mendez and his Hollywood connections set up a fake film company, with a fake film production office, and a fake script, etc. Once in Iran, Mendez gets in contact with the Group of 6, and they are slowly but surely preparing to try and escape out of Tehran.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, this is a terrific, tense and rousing historical drama, the likes of which we don't get to see often enough anymore these days. In fact, the whole movie experience feels like the movie was made in the late 70s (check out the classic Warner Bros. logo that opens the movie). It is equally clear that a number of events were fictionalized in order to advance the drama in the movie (just to name one: the chase to the plane at the end is a complete fabrication but makes for tense viewing). Other missed facts are harder to understand (for example: at the beginning of the movie, the narrator states that the Shah was \\"installed by US and British forces in 1953\\" when in reality he had ruled since 1941 as successor to his dad).<br /><br />This movie is a tour de force for Ben Affleck, who stars, produces and directs. The days of the \\"Bennifer\\" ridicule are long gone! \\"Argo\\" is his third movie as a director (after 2007's \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and 2010's \\"The Town\\"), and it seems that Affleck is either incredibly lucky, or simply getting better and better with each movie. I'll bet on the latter. There are several other choice performances in \\"Argo\\", including Alan Arkin and John Goodman as the Hollywood connections providing the fake film production house, but also Bryan Cranston as Tony's CIA superior. In all, this is truly Hollywood at its very best: a smart, tense, engaging drama/thriller, proving once again that you don't need to have the world blown up in smithereens every 5 minutes to engage an appreciative audience. \\"Argo\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!is a tour de force for Ben Affleck, who stars, produces and directs.

B004HD61KE|5.0|A fast paced action thriller that starts in the early pages and does not let up until the very end.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|I really tried to force myself into using this. Not only for my games (Borderlands 2, primarily), but also for my graphic packages (Lightroom 4). After about a week, it felt more and more natural. It was tough, however, because my muscle memory would force me to try to reach for the keyboard rather than the gameboard. Then it worked. After hours and hours of configuring and even more hours of usage, it started to feel natural.<br /><br />Then it broke. No profiles would load. It would still light up and the software would appear to load the proper profile, but the gameboard just wouldn't do what it was supposed to. No button press correlated to any type of input as far as my computer was concerned. The Borderlands splash graphic would appear on the LCD display on the gameboard, but that was it. The lights were on, but no one was home. No amount of reboots or USB ports would get it to work again.<br /><br />So I sent it back.<br /><br />So other than that big CON of not working anymore, I am giving it 2 stars because it once did. I may have received a dud. Even if it did work, I wish the rubber wrist pad was a bit softer. I also wish the directional joystick was analog and had an easier way to click it down. Not to mention, the software is pretty confusing.

I have been retired for ten years now and I still read it once a year. First advertising book I ever read and still the one that inspires me most. I know it must seem \\"old hat\\" to the newbies coming up today -- but you need to know where to start and learn advice from the best. What ever I accomplished in advertising -- awards, great clients -- I owe it all to Ogilvy.
B0051T46XM|4.0|I'm not a big fan of genre; however, this is a surprisingly good movie.  Completely different take on the 'monster/supernatural/horror' movie.  It's looking at it from a different perspective - because it's definitely not a US film - while still meeting all of the genre's formula requirements - it comes across somewhat like Blair Witch/Cloverfield with some Holywood thrown in.  Don't expect too much - but the special effects are actually ok.  A very fun movie to watch and you get past the sub-titles fairly quickly - the foreign language actually helps in this case.  Worth watching.

0316228532|4.0|This is not the typ of book I would normally read. I am all about fantasy and science fiction, but I love Rowling so of course I read her lastest novel. The writing is superb. Yes, I am biased because it is one of my favorite authors, but she does have the ability to paint a picture with words like few can. There were some portions that were tedious to read, but that may be because I am not used to books about everyday life.<br /><br />The story was interesting to me. It is the type of story that doesn't really have a clear protagonist/antagonist. It presents a community of people who all very human, though some are much better people than others. It explores prejudices and offers contrast of the persona that people present versus the real person. It's shown that no one's life or problems are ever as simple as they seem.<br /><br />This book is probably not everyone's cup of tea. It's kind of a \\"slice of life\\" story, showing only a brief period in time in a small town. If you are interested in social issues you will probably like the book.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I couldnt go to sleep,so i watched this movie,halfway thru it ,I fell asleep.next day,watched the segements i missed,and fell into sleep anew.this movie is one hell of a trash!i bet ,besides the talent fees of the actors,directors and the crew and cost equipment, the producer/s didnt spend more than 10K on the props.I wouldnt be surprised,if they filmed it less than a week.the producers duped thousands of moviegoers,whilst they laughing all the way to the bank! shame on you greedy people!
B002CVQAX6|3.0|With two exception this movie is just your standard ghost as antagonist horror flick - with some good actors thrown in.  The primary exception is the opening sequence, which is one of the most gut wrenching I've seen - similar in impact to a couple of the scenes in 13 Ghosts - but on a much grander scale and with less expectation of the event.  After that, it has some good twists and turns,  but the story sort of slides from there.  The second exception is that Gabriel Byrne is always great to watch.  Overall the film is worth watching, if only for that one scene...After you've seen it, go for a cruise :)

0812416503|2.0|I realize not all the classics are meant to have some kind of societal significance. Some of them are like guilty pleasure junk food - Anna Karenina, Lord of the Rings. But Rebecca is neither significant nor is it by any stretch of the word pleasurable to read. Forget that the main character fell madly \\"in love\\" and married a man after knowing him less than a month and then all she can do is complain about how she doesn't fit in when she gets to Manderly. Suspend even for a moment the fact that all of the characters are either stereotypes, tropes or stocks (Except Beatrice - she's kind of cool. I wish the book had been about her instead). The real problem I have with Rebecca is that, while it's supposed to be suspenseful, the main character pretty much discovers all there is to know about Rebecca in one long diatribe courtesy of her husband (Mrs. Danvers also has similar moments where she, not to be vulgar, /pukes/ out background information), and then there is that random bit about cancer at the end which caused the inquest to be completely anti-climactic. I'm not going to say Rebecca is a Shaggy Dog story, but the ending is unsatisfying and forced, and the only character I sympathized with through the whole thing was Jasper. Poor puppy. By the ending, I wondered whether or not this book was meant to be a joke or something - a dig in the ribs of similar, superfluous wastes of paper. But if it was, it wasn't presented very well. As a lesbian, I wish I could give du Maurier more credit, but I can't. I will say that her sexuality definitely comes out to the observant reader, but I'll say no more about that. TL;DR: read it if you want but it's not very good. :)
B007NU54H4|5.0|Amazingly beautiful w/ wonderfully written music & delightful, well-developed characters.  Ohhh, no wonder, John Lasseter is the Exec Producer.  lol  I love all his movies anyway.  The artwork & animation is transcendently enchanting & gorgeous. Storyline (as w/ ALL the Disney/Tink movies) is well-paced & refreshingly meaningful, esp compared to so much other disturbingly bad role models & influences out there for kids these days.  Flitter on.

0345803485|1.0|I had access to a sample of the book through my kindle. Thank god I didn't pay for it because I couldn't even get through the first chapter. It was very poorly written and beyond boring. Don't waste your time or money on it.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Works well - took me about 4 bottles to learn the technique. The tricks:<br /><br />1) make sure the blade is perpendicular to the bottle face;<br /><br />2) go slow and lightly with the blade - the point is to trace an even line all around, not to dig a groove in the bottle; and<br /><br />3) temperature extremes are what actually break the bottle - depending on the thickness of the glass, this can take up to a dozen boiling-to-ice water passes.<br /><br />Now I just need to find an efficient way to get the edges rounded for drinking glasses ...

B00881VLCE|5.0|so very much fun! it is just like a real puzzle, not like those square blocks that are way too easy. I absolutely love doing these puzzles. I just wish they can create different piece assortments because I have memorized the only piece sets cuurently available. if you enjoy picture puzzles I guarantee you not be able to put this down. a free game actually worth a review.
0399157565|5.0|The Bone Bed by Patricia Cornwell is the next installment in the Scarpetta Novel Series. Once again Patricia has done it! This was an awesome book. It had all the makings of a great novel. It was fast paced and yet seemed to last longer than it did, it had an excellent storyline, the characters are complex and yet easy to understand, and at $28.95 it was well worth the money.<br /><br />Lets take a look at the storyline.  Kay Scarpetta is Chief Medical Examiner for the Boston area. Her husband is Benton Wesley who works for the FBI as forensic psychologist. Kays' and Bentons' relationship is a complex one. As Kay ages she realizes she is an attractive aging female with a position of power in the government and she struggles to not act on the impulses that draw her towards attractive young men. As Kay works she is emailed a video of what she assumes to be the confirmation of a murder of a young paleontologist.<br /><br />The next day Kay gets called to the scene of where a body has been discovered. But the body is entangled with a 100 year old turtle who is a member of an almost extinct species that has been around since the dinosaur age. Things sky rocket into difficulty for Kay and the members of the CFC.<br /><br />This novel is another great instalment in the Scarpetta Series. A little pricey for the Hardback but well worth the money for anyone who enjoys this series.
B006QVRVJK|1.0|I have to say that I respect Roman Polanski as a director and I have often found that I \\"like\\" (not love) his movies, but this movie just fell flat for me.  I thought it was going to be witty, cynical,sarcastic and funny.  It was anything but those things.  I thought it was boring, boring, boring.  There was not anything funny about this movie, just two couples bickering over nothing but their ailing relationships.  I would not recommend this movie, unless you need something to help you sleep.

B008XNZMOU|1.0|Miss Taylor Swift, yes most of us have wished for you to change your sound. Whether it be a little more pop, or a little more country, we still asked. Some got tired of the usual stuff, some didn't mind and loved it.<br /><br />I love your old music. I love the curly hair and the clothes you wore, and the music videos that were made. I still love you as a person and an artist.<br /><br />I'm only giving this album: one star.<br /><br />ONLY because I do adore 'Begin Again'. That is the only song on here that even remotely reminds me of your old albums. I'm happy you wanted to change up your style, that's cool. Everyone does it. But to lose yourself entirely into other genres that just don't work with your sound, is horrible. I feel like you changed your sound completely for more fans. Maybe you should have thought about the fans you already have instead of trying to get everyone else on board.<br /><br />I kept wanting to skip tracks just to find that old Taylor Swift, that old sound of yours that everyone loved or still does.<br /><br />Yeah some people like or love your new album but this one just doesn't cut it for me.<br /><br />I'm still a fan of yours and will probably go to one of your concerts next year, but I won't be listening to this album again anytime soon.<br /><br />From a fan with an honest opinion.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the book.  It was a quick read.  Similar to 50 Shades, but with a twist.  I hope there will be more.
B009B2U73I|5.0|A wonderful cd to listen to when the work day is done. Her soulful voice and lyrics are a welcome relief.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been playing this game on my moms iphone 4s and it is so much fun. I have been waiting for this game because it is fun and addicting.Now that I can play it on my kindle fire it keeps me entertained. this is the best app ever. It is fun and addicting. Get this app now!!!!!<br />  thanx, alexis krall
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Excellent case for the Kindle Fire.  Exceeded my expectations and excellent for positioning device for use. Case protects the device when not in use. Outside cover is easy to clean and the elastic band closure works very well.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Movie is Awesome! The extra features are fantastic. They did a great job on this package! You won't regret buying it.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|Four Stars.<br /><br />This is definitely a guilty-pleasure album.<br /><br />Let me tell you something... I was never a fan of One Direction until I got the album. I thought 'What Makes You Beautiful' was an annoying song that never stopped playing on the pop radio stations and anything that I heard about them always made me want to cringe at the thought of this generations' music. (I'm a 90s kid)<br /><br />One Direction reminds me very much of Dream Street. If you know Dream Street and have this album, you may be able to agree with me. If you don't know them, get their album. The sad thing about Dream Street is they only had one album that truly made thousands of fans, including me (of course). One Direction might hit it off with another album or two.<br /><br />I really like this album. I think it's fun to sing to, very catchy and you can dance to the beats of almost every song. The lyrics are very good and I'm hoping that they themselves wrote the lyrics and not some person writing the lyrics for them to sing.<br /><br />When Simon Cowell says you suck, then you suck. When Simon Cowell says you're to be a star, you should probably watch out for them. I think One Direction has only one way to go and that is up, so I hope they don't screw up too much and rely on 'pretty faces'.
B0091REZMW|5.0|like this game pretty fun and interesting.  strategy wise i like to get on and play when ever I have free time..more of an adult game then kid game.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I started this book because of an online knitting group I belong to. Although its dark nature it's a good read.  Once I finish with this book I will start the second book which states that it is a prequel.
B005K2XM94|4.0|I had both the kindle fire and the nexus 7 and this sleeve actually fits the nexus better.  I use it every time I travel and it has kept both of my tablets pristine.  A little on the pricey side given what it is, but it definitely does the job
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works as described.  Have used it several times now and it is easy to use and free.  Hard to beat.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|Assumed it would have features of the Windows client. As-is it appears no better than the free Roku app.<br /><br />Hopefully the developer(s) will add better support for DVD isos as I suspect many people will purchase for this reason.<br /><br />Love the idea, but annoyed to pay for an app the I cannot return within two minutes of downloading.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i'm getting ready to download app Ya hope its a good app I rate it 5 star ***** I'm so happy

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really was a good story and romantic. I enjoyed the theme and was very captivated by it. Good read and thriling.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|This movie would have been watchable if I hadn't kept uttering, \\"are you kidding me?\\" every time I saw Rihanna.  Totally miscast; in fact, had to be cast in this role only to bring in a demographic which made matters worse.  To future Directors and Producers: let pop stars be pop stars, let actors/actresses make movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a brainteaser and game rolled into one.<br />wasn't sure how I'd like it but became addicted to it<br />definitely something for kids and grownups alike
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I adore this book, thus the 5-star review.  However, I wanted to buy an e-book version.  But Amazon is making this product only available for certain devices, like their new Fire.  I have an older Kindle, and I really resent this attempt to control what device I can read on.  I usually support Amazon wholeheartedly, and, as an author who supports independent authors, I have sung its praises.  But this type of consumer tactic leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.  Frankly, it was not worth it, shaking my loyalty just to try to get me to buy a device I will not buy.  I am disappointed in Amazon, and hope it will re-consider.
B008476HBM|5.0|Fell in love with this novel when I had to read it for introduction to fiction class. Even though the novel lacks the description of nature, it enables one to feel rural England with its green meadows and fields. The plot is basically a soap opera but it is simply fun to read and see how it develops till it reaches the good end. Therefore, it is a truth univerisally acknowledged that the lovel of great literature must be in want of reading this book :).
0385535147|5.0|A Federal Judge is killed - a lawyer is sent to prison for a crime he did not commit - a get out of jail free card - Rule 35.  Grisham has crafted a moving, sometimes humorous, and entertaining mystery thriller that will require you to keep reading to get the gist and details. I think you should read Grisham's latest novel \\"THE RACKETEER\\" to find out about Rule 35 and who uses it.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author of \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
B00891IVEO|5.0|It is the best season! Each caracter gets perfect, you hate and love them along the season but, what it is more important, you really understand them. Everything has an explanation, there are no mistakes. Perfect!
B009329ZF2|3.0|If the story line was a bit more realistic. I would have enjoyed the movie more. The special effects were great. The rest of the movie sucked. This movie would be okay for young boys. This movie is kinda like July 4th meets Pearl Harbor. Since I was in the Navy. This movie is kinda of a joke.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|EASY and effective.  What's not to like?  I haven't noticed any issues with draining. My Kindle lasts fabulously with this application going off a couple of times a day and the wi-fi on too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner but not very likable characters.  But you want to know what happens.  Wil be interesting book club discussion.
B000FC1GJW|4.0|Bound to become a modern day classic for children & adults alike. It covers some interesting religious & spiritual concepts which, no matter what your beliefs, are bound to evoke speculation.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|excellent video the actors did an exceptional job. the fight scenes were very realistic. overall a wonderful time to loose ones self for awhile.
B00173EVDQ|5.0|I'm sure you already know what a great album this is but the mfsl vinyl pressing is quite simply the ultimate version hands down. This is one instance where something actually lives up to it's legendary status. I know these sell for a kings ransom but it's  worth every penny.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|Great book, Sanderson has made a truly epic world in this series. I get the feeling it may wind up a bit short though to give the whole story.
B0090X4HES|5.0|Wow is pretty much all I have to say about Good Kid: M.A.D.D. City.  Kendrick, your lyrics and tight beats to this unique album proves you have arrived!  As many of our hip-hop favorites over the last 2 decades slowly wining down their careers in the game, new blood has to show this genre will be in good hands for many years to come, thanks to Lamar no doubt it will be.<br /><br />I've only heard a few songs from Kendrick Lamar--thanks to MMG--but now since he's on Dre's Aftermath label -- he'll definitely be in great hands for years working with a legendary Grammy-winning producer who has produced many classics for NWA, 2PAC, and Eminem.  Kendrick's sound almost bares in comparison to Outkast first album (which for a lot of hip-hop junkies that album was a pure classic)!<br /><br />There is something extremely cosmic and raw with his lyrics especially when you hear 'Poetic Justice' 'Art of Peer Pressure'  'good kid', and 'm.a.D.D city' and 'Swimming Pools.'  The rest of the album is quite impressive and very visionary if you ask me.  You can now count me in as a fan of Kendrick Lamar!
0446580848|5.0|I am a huge fan of Nelson Demille and the John Corey series, especially The Lion's Game and Night Fall.  I was eagerly awaiting the release of The Panther and while not his best, it was a thoroughly entertaining read. The inclusion of Paul Brenner was a nice surprise but I wish Demille had done more with his story line. It made sense to me that Brenner was included in Operation Clean Sweep because of what he discovered in Up Country though Demille never tied it together. Did anyone else think this? Hopefully, this won't be the last we see of John Corey and Paul Brenner and I would love to see another stand alone Paul Brenner book.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I don't care how chessy some may think this film is, but take a second look. It's amazing what the studios can do for us on the big screen. Why everyone is panning so many films is actually quite stupid. We go to the movies to be entertained & this one did. Of course not many films are perfect but most of the critics of film mostly can't get themselves out of a mode of no good. I say to those critics. Let us, the viewing public decide what we want or don't want. I loved this film so there!!!!!!!!!!!!
1611761182|3.0|Winter of the World - Ken Follett<br /><br />3 stars<br /><br />Ken Follett presents the 20th century; part two. It's a blockbuster. It's a big, fat book. All the required elements are present; evil incarnate, self-sacrificing heroics, political chicanery, personal ambition and sex. Lots of preoccupation with sex.  It may be my personal bias, since I am the single parent of a 17-year-old boy, but my recurring thought as I read this 940 page tome, was \\"high school history\\".<br /><br />Follett continues the story told in Fall of Giants. Each of the five international families in the first book brings on its second generation. As in the first book, all of these families have members who play significant or supporting  roles on the international stage. Follett places at least one character at most of the significant events from the Spanish Civil War to the formation of the United Nations. As a history lesson, told with plenty of up close and personal human interest, it works pretty well.<br /><br />As literature.... well this is Follett, I wasn't expecting great literary fiction, but I found the writing somewhat disappointing in any case. First, there are the coincidences of the half-brothers; opposite sides of the political spectrum,  unlikely allies in the war. It's a clich&eacute; to use it once; but twice in the same book?  I could only laugh.  A surprising number of his male characters fall in love with gorgeous women at first sight. But, although Follett says that his characters make love, he writes about sex. They have sex, which is described like the play by play description of a sports event.  Definitely a male perspective, and in my opinion, lacking in finesse.<br /><br />Follett does write heroic, admirable female characters. I like these women. They are strong, intelligent survivors. That is why I was disappointed and somewhat offended by his treatment of the post war Soviet occupation of Berlin. Given his previous descriptions of Nazi brutality, Follett gives a surprisingly banal description of the Soviet gang rape of one character. His subsequent statement that all of the female characters suffered rape under the Soviets, and their apparent acceptance of the fact with minimal trauma, is more than unrealistic. Atrocities of such magnitude should be treated as more than just a plot device.<br /><br />I had both the printed and recorded version of this book. It was read by John Lee who is usually one of my favorite readers.  In this case, I thought his reading was a bit monotonous and rushed. Much of that was, I think, due to the nature of Follett's stilted prose. Even though Lee seemed to be rushing his narration, I found parts of the book moving too slowly. I turned to the print copy to move more quickly to the very clich&eacute;d ending.urprisingly banal description of the Soviet gang rape of one character.

B007SGM084|5.0|I am delighted with the way in which the author makes you see how Ana tames Christian with her love. She endeared herself to me when she made Christian realize just how foolish that contract was - and she did it by questioning every line of it.  And, of course when she left him because first of all he beat her, but then he ruled out love, frankly, he had it coming.  She told him that she did not want him to hit her but changed it to she didn't want him to hurt her. I,somehow,wanted her to stick to her rule about hitting her. He was able to talk her our of that one. As for Christian, once her realized how much he loved Ana, he turned into the perfect lover.  I think the love story mixed with all the drama makes it deserving of a five star rating.<br />[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set<br />I had the individual books on my Kindle, but when I realized that I could get them together as a bundle, I did that.

Book five is a better than average example of his storytelling prowess. Lets face it a story with something like 1500 named characters takes an investment from the reader, but those who make the investment will find themselves making an hour or two every day to read the next chapter or two, and all the days together add up to more pleasure per hour than anything else you can do with your time. Don't for heavens sake begin the journey with this book...start with book one...winter is coming!

B000MD7OKY|4.0|Cary Grant is as dapper as ever in this somewhat more light-hearted Hitchcock thriller. The car chase scene is particularly humorous with Grant apparently scared witless as Grace kelly goes careening 'round every corner.

I know a bit much but I don't care.  All the guys are hot.  My favorite is Matthew M with those beautiful curls and my Ken Doll Matt Bomer.  He is so beautiful.  Love entire cast.
B006QS07IK|5.0|Frankenstein is a fantastic work of classic literature.  I think few people realize just how different the novel is from the archetype version of the story most people are familiar with.  You know, the cheesy green monster with the bolts in the neck, flat head and elevator shoes with the moral not to play God.  Oh, yes, and the creature in that idea usually only grunts or says things like \\"Fiiire Bad!\\"<br /><br />That is NOT what Frankenstein, the novel, is.  In the novel the creature has yellow eyes, tightly drawn skin, long black hair, is very agile, and is highly intelligent. The creature is hyper intelligent. Within minutes of his creation he figured out how to dress himself and only months after that he could speak, read and write, more articulately than his own creator.  He was even quoting Milton.  Many people remember the moral not to play God but few remember that there is a secondary moral. The creature had to forgive his creator for how he treated him, for abandoning him, and for not preparing him for the cruelties of the world.  He had to learn that revenge would bring him no peace but only perpetuate a cycle of anger and revenge.<br /><br />There is also the message of responsibility to one's child and the importance of keeping one's promises (which Victor breaks several times in the course of the story and only causes more trouble for everyone invovled).<br /><br />The creature is tragic.  This is a brilliant work of literature by a impressively creative woman.  What she created was a story that will last through the ages, a combination of science, alchemy and parent / child metaphors that reaches us on a very basic level.  Read the classic novel if you have not yet done so already.

B000F5GNX8|3.0|'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' isn't much of a movie: the plot is complete nonsense, the tone is all over the place and the pacing seems to have bipolar disorder. That the film's completely aware of it's faults to the point it breaks the fourth wall just to TELL you about them is an annoyance beyond comprehension. What saves this complete mess of an experience, though is the engaging lead characters played to comic-perfection by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Downey Jr. plays Harry Lockhart, a professional burgler and narrator of 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'. Through bizarre (and unlikely) circumstance Harry is hired to play the role of a police detective for a film and is introduced to &quot;Gay&quot; Perry (Kilmer), a private investigator. After running into a former high school crush at a Hollywood party, Harry and Perry get mixed up in a mystery involving frame-ups, mistaken identities and murder. While the story has all the characters and fixings of a detective story (a rich, shady producer; two strong-arm thugs) it's really a mess of ideas thrown together and the tone keeps changing from snarky comedy to dark-drama-mystery on the fly. 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' also wants you to know it's clever by having Harry break the fourth-wall and point out the film's inconsistencies; I don't mind a film wanting to be self-aware but I found it's obviousness unbearably annoying.<br /><br />So why do I enjoy this film? When this movies' funny it's FUNNY! From Perry's &quot;concealed&quot; gun to Harry's disastrous attempt to intimidate a &quot;suspect&quot; with Russian roulette 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' had me bursting out laughing when I least expected it. It's this unpredictable nature that kept me hooked that so, when the film did something I hated or drowned on with it's out-of-place seriousness I knew it had some perfectly timed comedy right around the corner.<br /><br />As I've said 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' would be nothing without it's main characters and Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer deliver some of the best performances of their careers. Harry's likeably dopey and Downey Jr.'s rapid-fire delivery makes him self-assured in his sometimes ignorance. Kilmer's tough-as-nails portrayal of Gay Perry is refreshing and his back and forth dialogue with Downey (&quot;where the hell did you learn math?&quot;) is a scream. Michelle Monaghan is likeable as Harry's high-school crush and Corbin Bersen is perfectly smarmy as the shady movie producer but they're completely overshadowed by our main detectives.<br /><br />'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' is my ultimate guilty pleasure. I can't recommend it for everyone as it's annoyances are many and it's self-aware cleverness can put-off as much as it entertains. But I cant deny I enjoyed watching this movie and it still manages to make me laugh after all this time.nd Val Kilmer deliver some of the best performances of their careers.

0446582778|4.0|Angels Flight involves a case of a murdered civil rights lawyer and a possibly unrelated bystander on a train track. Detective Bosch takes the lead on the case only to discover that it is connected to another case, one of a murdered child. His trust in his \\"own people\\" is shaken as he suspects that police brutality and murder may indeed be happening right under his nose and being committed by people he never suspected. The book is a difficult one to read due to much brutality, child abuse, and Bosch' marriage falling apart.
0393089134|4.0|For those that considering reading this book, don't become discouraged with the language at first.  Once you get further into the book, it becomes easier to get use to.  I believe this on purpose by the author to make us consider if we, ourselves, are clockwork oranges as well.  This is a good discussion book for a book club, as it lends to a lot of good discussion and critical thinking.  It's pretty interesting that Alex, the main character, is written so that you feel sorry for him at times.  It would be rare, I think, if someone read the book and didn't care for him a bit.  Again, this calls for asking the question on just how clockwork orange we are.  I have to say, if you're going to read the book, find a version with the original ending chapter.  It may change your perspective on what happened if you've only seen the movie.  The book is a fun read and once you get over the language that is purposefully used for a reason, can lead to some critical thinking that shows this book is a classic for a reason.  Final Grade - B
0811847365|5.0|Featuring breath-taking art work in a field journal format, this book delights and captivates the reader with its detailed illustrations and insightful commentary. You'll be transported to a galaxy far, far away as you discover the native species of such planets as Tattooine, Naboo, Degobah, and many more. My only complaint is that it was too short. I'd love to see a sequel that covers more planets and their wildlife in the Star Wars galaxy.

B009NQKPUW|1.0|Frankly, I expected better.  Much better than this.  The second movie of this series (Aliens) is still by far the best.  I've viewed only the BluRay version of Prometheus, so I can't comment directly on the extras.  But given how unimpressive the movie itself was, I'm unlikely to spend much time with them.  I don't have a 3D TV yet, but 3D can't improve this movie's shaky concept, screenplay, and on-screen execution. Or some surprisingly crude CGI effects, such as depiction of the \\"Engineer\\" alien characters.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was as sloppy as the mission and scientific procedures depicted. Come on - you land on an alien world which you know nothing about - with darkness approaching - and the next thing you do is to haphazardly drive off in rover vehicles at high speed?  And then you take off helmets inside an unknown structure without analyzing potential pathogens and contaminants?  And you intentionally handle unknown black goo?  I nearly stopped the movie at that point, but decided to keep watching hoping it might improve from there.  Unfortunately not. There were some interesting tie-in points to the previous movies, such as some back story about the petrified pilot and a vague idea how the nasty xenomorphs originated.  But the plausibility of the scientific methods and procedures got even worse - to the point of being laughable - which I doubt the makers of this movie intended.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|I thought that this would be a return not of an older Bruce Wayne but someone within his late 30's or early (very early 40's). But as the story progressed, it took me by surprise that the writers of this animated masterpiece would allow the use of an older Bruce Wayne to return once again as the Caped Crusader to clean up the streets of Gotham by reliving some of the glory days of yesteryear. I thought it was very good and full of action. A hidden dark side to the much older Bruce Wayne than his younger days but still the same \\"Smart Detective\\" as ever but getting the job done to right what was wrongfully missing within the public's outcry of what was missing for 10-15? years of justice, with the help of the new sidekick, within this animated yet brooding character that only Bruce Wayne could bring back to the streets of Gotham! I am really looking forward to part 2 of the Legend's return to see what new tricks mixed in with some old tricks that the Joker will have for the one who \\"Completes Him\\"!

B00866JLEG|5.0|First I have to confess that I have not read the book. This is not my preferred genre for reading.<br /><br />The film however deserves a viewing as it does rings around what could have been a Hallmark movie. This was formula enough to pretty much guess the complete film from the early beginning. However I suspect the draw is the character interaction and not a mystery or action. All the actors were good in their parts and very believable. I thought Blythe Danner was exceptional.<br /><br />Basic story is of a marine Vet, on his third tour of duty in Iraq; Sgt. Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) finds a picture during the war. He believes this is his good luck charm and is determined to fine the person behind the smile in the picture that he owes his life to. He finds more than he bargained for. Did he fine more than he could handle?

0810993139|5.0|When I was reading this book I almost thought Jeff Kinney had spying on me my whole life, because the main character Greg Heffely is just like me. Both Greg Heffely wants to be rich and famous, but unfortuantly we are stuck in an old trashy middle school. In fact, I don't think that there is a kid who wouldn't have a little bit of Greg's life. Annoying siblings? Who dosen't have them. Video games and zero outdoors? To that I say YAY! Terrible school plays? Greg was the tree in his and I was the cockroach in mine. It makes me laugh when I compare Gregory's comical life to my own. The illustrations add a lot of life to the book as well, making it feel less like a novel and more like a real diary. Don't miss out on the chance to see if you've got some Gregory moments.
B00005V1B1|5.0|Mirage is Camel's second album, released in 1974. It features some of their best known songs,including \\"Nimrodel\\" and \\"Lady Fantasy\\". It is also a showcase for Andrew Latimer's flute, notably on \\"Supertwister\\".<br /><br />\\"You don't listen to a band like Camel once and get an appreciation for the musicianship. You have to listen to them a few times before their music begins to register, those long and delicately arranged instrumental passages burn slowly, but once the melodies are in your head, they don't rub out easily.\\"<br /><br />Camel is...<br /><br />Andrew Latimer...guitars, flute, vocals on \\"Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider\\" and \\"Lady Fantasy.\\"<br />Peter Bardens...organ, piano, Minimoog, Mellotron, vocals on \\"Freefall\\", Fender piano, Clavinet.<br />Doug Ferguson...bass<br />Andy Ward...drums, percussion<br /><br />Categorized as heavy progressive rock, the \\"Mirage\\" CD I would rank as my favorite from the Camel catalog. Not a lot of vocal presence on this offering but that is not a bad thing as the music dominates the production making it a very strong album. Very tight compositions, astonishing musical prowess for the time period. This is a classic CD, full of a myriad of musical styles, jazzy, rocking steadily forward. A must have for Progressive Rock collections.<br /><br />I read another review which is spot on as follows:<br /><br />\\" Mirage's most compelling moments are however its two epics. The middle track Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider, is once again full of signature Camel moments: Latimer's gorgeous melodic guitar lines, relaxed vocals, Ferguson's typical deep bass sound, and a smooth flow that makes it seem shorter than the 9 minutes it actually takes. The group's storytelling ability is most prominent here. Latimer wrote the song about the Gandalf character from The Lord of the Rings (those fantastical kind of themes were really hip among the rock bands of the era, after all), which is easily derived from the lyrics: `Once he wore grey/he fell and slipped away/From everybody's sight/The wizard of them all/came back from his fall/This time wearing white.'<br /><br />In traditional manner, the best epic is of course saved for last. Lady Fantasy, written together by the entire band (most of the band's compositions were written by Latimer and Bardens), is one of the true highlights of Camel's career. The lyrical content may actually be a little cheesy, but flows wonderfully with the music. Each section is extremely well though-out and Latimer's playing, especially his highly emotional lead that recurs throughout the song, is to die for. These 12 minutes top off the accomplishment that is this record with proud determination, and are a reminder why it is held in such high regard. Mirage is a definite progressive classic, and should be owned by anyone who pronounces himself a fan of the genre.\\"<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Camel's \\"Mirage\\" on You Tube.e grey/he fell and slipped away/From everybody's sight/The wizard of them all/came back from his fall/This time wearing white.'<br /><br />In traditional manner, the best epic is of course saved for last.

B000001EXR|3.0|\\"Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions\\" was actually recorded in 1995, but had a delayed release until 1997 due to Gene and Paul conducting their successful reunion with Ace and Peter. This album is exactly what you might expect to hear from KISS circa 1995. KISS have always been master Chameleons, and in the mid-90s, alt/rock was the rage and KISS did their best Soundgarden impersonation.<br /><br />All KISS fans have their personal favorite era of the band, and mine happens to be the mid-late 80s adaption of the band. While we all love KISS for their endurance and solid records, sometimes fans tend to question their judgement on the musical direction  of the band. I am not a particular fan of grunge music, and seeing KISS make a grunge record must have felt like seeing them make \\"Dynasty\\" in the late 70s. Tracks like \\"Master & Slave,\\" \\"Hate\\" and \\"Rain\\" are the stand-outs to me, while most of the rest is pretty forgettable, but KISS almost succeed in making a decent grunge record.<br /><br />If you like mid-90s grunge bands like Alice In Chains and Soundgarden, you'll more than likely enjoy this record as well. However, if you can't stand any of those bands, and like \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Lick It Up\\" you may want to look before you leap!
0307957837|2.0|I read this series on the advice of a friend who was enamored with it, after finishing them I confess I really don't understand the appeal. Pullman is most known for being an outspoken atheist , this was the only really original part of what was a mediocre fantasy series. It's clear plot came behind extolling his religious views.<br /><br />This is also morally problematic when you think about it, I'm not a theist but the idea of a children's book where the main characters have to fight and destroy the Catholic Church and the Judeo-Christian God only promotes intolerance. There is even a scene where characters kill a key figure from Jewish mythology who is trying to commit rape, sensitive to other cultures this book is not. Even if Pullman disagrees with other's religious views is portraying violence against any religious group as heroic something we want to teach to children?<br /><br />Even these issues aside there is not much original here. The first book's steampunk world is vaguely interesting but not something fantasy readers haven't seen before. Later books introduce the \\"real world,\\" which means that Pullman tries to write political intrigue that reads like a bad Dan Brown novel. The character's aren't gratingly bad but I am hard pressed to describe anything interesting about them not based on appearance or their role in the plot. There are some cool concepts, armored talking polar bears stand out, but nothing that I think will be remembered in 5 years.<br /><br />Final verdict, if your adult skip it. If your thinking about it for your child, even if you're an atheist, think about it's message first.
0525953728|4.0|'No Easy Day' is a good read if you're interested in what really happened in Abottabad in 2011.<br />The writer depicts very clearly what the media is not saying, until now that is. The book not only describes the takedown of UBL, but also focusses on the mission that freed Captain Phillips in the Gulf of Aden, and several other DEVGRU actions.<br /><br />All in all a good read, which I would suggest to anyone interested in DEVGRU's role in taking out UBL !

B008D1LVRY|5.0|I think anyone who loves Mudvaye will likely ejoy Band of Brothers. The lead singer's signature vocals are there and the guitar/bass/drums are awesome.

With a band name like \\"Hellyeah\\" you know what to expect.

B004LWZWBU|2.0|Even though this movie is placed in the comedy section, it's not really a comedy. I think they only put this in the comedy section because they have an all star cast of funny people! Otherwise, you get other actors and do the same movie and people would be asking why is this movie in the comedy section?<br /><br />I really like this movie, but they need to really know how to put the movie in the right category. This movie is so much of a Adventure Drama that it wouldn't fit anywhere else. Why is this so? The actors travel in the movie to multiple places in the whole movie and they even show you how and what they use to travel. They talk about travel and where they have gone and everything is about their adventures. Heck, they even show how one of their birds travel to place to place. So, it's definitely an adventure movie.<br /><br />Is this movie a drama movie? There a great deal of relationships problems, emotional problems, job suffering,  and everyone favorite life choices based decisions that makes you feel like hating each character in the movie. If that's not drama to you, you don't know what drama is!!!<br /><br />Now the big question, is this a comedy? Heck no! What in the world did people thought was funny is the real question here? Any one that found this movie really funny tell me what part? Where was the humor?<br /><br />Here's examples, of what people may think could be funny but wasn't really. When Steve Martin ran towards the plane and was about to fly away. Owen Wilson saw Martin running towards the plane, but didn't say anything about it and grin about it. What? Was that supposed to be funny? Made me kind of mad about it. Missing a flight that won't be able to take again until the next week. Oh I would hate if that happened to me. Oh that really made me feel like it was a drama than made me feel like laughing about it. Who really thought that was hilarious. Is one sick person!<br /><br />Was it supposed to be funny when Owen Wilson hops a fence, while Martin was distracted by a old lady. Then, Wilson quickly takes a picture of the bird and then he hops over the fence again out? And, the fact that Martin never knew about Wilson action was supposed to make that funny? Really??? I saw it - I thought about it, and not even a chuckle came out of me. I like to add that the jungle music and narration playing in the background while Wilson was doing his action didn't make me laugh out loud. He didn't look funny doing it. He didn't fall over doing it. He didn't look great doing it. He just did it and it wasn't a funny thing to it.<br /><br />Why in the world did those idiots put this movie in the comedy section? Really? Put it in the true category it deserves to be in! Do it now!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great read. Shows how husbands & wives play the flip game. I recommend for couples who have lost the spark.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I am a big fan of The Walking Dead. I have seen every episode so far. Even have little parties on Sunday where friends come over and watch it with us. I think the comic are just s good if not a little better.

B005DI994W|1.0|I love this movie. I've had it for years and was delighted when I read it was on<br />Blu-Ray in 1.77 widescreen. I'll have a bit of that I said but what a disappointment when I viewed it. It's NOT in widescreen or 1.77. It is in 1.37 full screen. It is a tiny square on my 52\\" screen. It's like watching it from the back of Wembley Stadium. Why do advertisers say it is Widescreen on their stat. when it  most certainly is not?? It is NOT even a good Blu-Ray. Definition is scant and the colours bleed in certain scenes. How glad I was to get back to my Carlton standard release of this great movie that is a fine sharp presentation that fills my big screen TV.<br />The same problem arises with another of my favourites \\"Drums Along The Mohawk\\" which they said also was widescreen and it quite simply isn't. I have now decided to stick to my standard versions of all 1.33 movies and only buy Blu-Ray films that have been filmed originally in widescreen.<br /><br />A most disappointed Blue Ray enthusiast.<br /><br />Joe Doherty.
0978545095|5.0|Another fascinating collection of Maier photos well worth waiting for after Maloof's 'Street photographer' from 2011.  This selection is from Jeffrey Goldstein's collection of about sixteen thousand negatives, 225 rolls of film and fifteen hundred color slides (so expect more books and I'm especially interested in how she handled color).    The nine chapters have photos from 1949 to the mid-seventies and so they are a good sampling of the things that caught Maier's eye.  The three chapters that I thought worked the best are: 'America' with forty-seven photos of Los Angeles and New York; 'Maxwell' has twenty photos of this Chicago street market; 'Downtown' with thirty-four taken around the Chicago Loop area.  These are photos of Maier at her best, capturing the bustle of big city streets with energy and compassion.  One thing missing from Maloof's book was an explanation of who was Vivian Maier.  'Out of the shadows' fortunately fills in a lot of detail about her life and interest in photography and each chapter gets a short essay about the photos that follow.    It is inevitable that this book is compared to Maloof's and like another reviewer I prefer his book.  It has a much better selection of photos and nearly everyone shows one of Maier's strengths: her ability to create perfect framing. 'Out of the shadows' has many more photos but because of this I thought it also included several that seemed, perhaps, not worth including.  The child asleep in a car, page 123, street light on page 272, some lit windows floating on a black square, page 277 (it could well be that some some non-specific photos were introduced to create a change of pace as the reader turns the pages, in the 'Street photographer' book several blank pages were used to do this).  Maloof's book is also a better production with a good matt art paper for the 200 screen printing which produces solid blacks and mid-tones, something I thought was missing from 'Out of the shadows' though printed with a 175screen.    Both Maier books, of course, display wonderful photos taken by this extraordinary amateur photographer.  Who knew while she was alive?  Her legacy will slowly be revealed with each new publication.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|it starts out a little technical - and pretty much stays that way. But rather surprisingly, I got drawn into it ... I was right there, on Mars - taking on those technical challenges one at a time. Best .99 cents I have ever spent: JBW
B00005AXKF|1.0|Unfortunately I did not read the small print!!  My grandchildren were very disappointed since it did not work on their DVD player. I am extremely. Disappointed in Amazon for even carrying or selling an item that most likely will not work in the U.S.!!!!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|It seems Child is just going through the motions. He knows us Reacher addicts will buy anything he writes. I had this conflict as I was reading Wanted Man between the Jack Reacher that we have all been following in the book series and the one cast in the upcoming movie. Doesn't work for me. I will wait before I purchase his next one and I will skip the movie.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I have always loved this movie as a kid but it was tremendously hard to find on DVD without paying a fortune. Thank goodness for the internet.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the book and couldn't put it down. I would get so angry with Victoria and then hurt with her. Not an easy book to read but worthwhile. Shows the gamut of emotions from hate to love
B000TQ0EIS|5.0|Love this album wish I had the opportunity to see her in concert. I use this as a workout album.
B009WJX10G|4.0|I personally like the regular show a lot better, but compared to cloverleaf and other home-made types ...it was good.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Was expecting more out of this film..I did not think the cast went well together. Seemed like the story line was a little odd
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is great but I hats how it always goes to it when it gets plied in or taken out other wise its a fabulous app I suggest you get it
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|Really let's me think about how I can craft my own sticky idea. I had a hard time staying engrossed because of how short each subsection was, but that is really a issue with the organization of the book, not its content. I recommend this for anyone looking to not only get better at their jobs, but simply trying to improve their ability to communicate with others.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|An old classic book. Good for old and young in developing their vocabulary.<br />Love getting classics on kindle. Easy and fun to use. Easy for young readers to read. If you haven't read it yet, you should.
B009EANE3M|5.0|catchy songs, heart felt songs, and of course heartache songs.  GREAT album...my fave so far followed by Science & Faith.  The Script is quickly moving up my chart of favorite bands.  Keep it up guys and I will keep going to your concerts.  BTW the concert was exceptional at the Greek Theater in Hollywood.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was another thought provoking book from the author. For me personally it came at a period in my own life when time is all I think about. My dad is dying his time slipping away , all of my mother's time is spent caring for him, my job wants more and more of my time, my husband gets less and less of it and my children are drifting in their lives thinking their time is endless. Everyday is a race with the clock but most of my time is spent doing what I have to do and not what I want to. This book reminded me that every day should not be ruled by the clock. That, yes we have obligations such as work that require adherence to a schedule, but sometimes we speed up our own clocks just by the power we give to time- both the counting of it and the passing of it. Time will pass and we need to accept that fact not waste time railing against it.  We need to slow down and savor our time. We don't have to fit in as much as possible into every hour of every day. For each one of us our time here on Earth is finite. We need to learn to cherish all of our time -the happy and the sad. It is a perfect book for this time in our world when everything is moving faster and faster. Everyone wants more and more of everything. If we have so many devices in our world to make our lives easier why do we seem to have less and less time for the things that really matter to us? The answer is choice. What choices do we make everyday? What do we sacrifice in  our dance with time?
B007G51UV0|5.0|I bought this motherboard about 4 months ago, and I am very impressed.<br /><br />The BIOS looks great, and easy to navigate.<br /><br />The board itself looks amazing, and had no flaws on arrival.<br /><br />I currently have 32GB 1600Mhz ram installed in it, and have no issues.<br /><br />I am also using the i7-3770k processor, and along with the RAM I am running smoother than ever before.<br /><br />I have never been so impressed by a motherboard before.

B008CPZNL6|5.0|I appreciate how the app puts articles in groups. I can keep up with news I need and learn new techniques in the photography section etc.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This latest group of songs compiled by the piano guys is great.  My family and I can not get enough. In my opinion this group of guys have taken classical music which in most cases would leave me bored and added some flare in the form of new music mixed with the classical.  The music featured on this album not only has captivated my wife and I, but my children also love the songs.  My 6 year old son loves the cello wars, my four year old daughter sings as loud as she can to somewhere over the rainbow and what makes you beautiful, and my two year old daughter says play peponi over and over again.  This music is fun for all, and I am happy to share it with my young children.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This movie was surprisingly entertaining. The dynamics of the relationship of this version of Holmes with other primary characters is very interesting. The movie is dark, amusing, and worth viewing for fans of Holmes, the actors, or of this genre.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|After watching this documentary you might be shopping at Whole Foods a lot more. Don't like paying high prices for organic meat but this has changed mt mind.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show on FX. I bought this season for a great price on here. If you are into ghosts this is the show for you.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is my favorite version of Emma so far! The very first one I saw was with Gwyneth Paltrow. While I love her I completely hated the version of Emma it was Clueless all over again but in 18th century outfits. I seriously kept just seeing the scenes from clueless with Paltrow as the main girl. I was hesitant to watch this because I had never read Emma and was worried I would have just a rehatching of that version all over again! But I got a great surprise and now I have to say it is my 2nd favorite Jane Austen novel, the first being of course Pride and Prejudice.  I thought the soundtrack was beautiful for the mini tv series and a definite must have dvd for Jane Austen lovers for their collection! Romola Garai was brilliant and just the perfect Emma.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|A perfect book when you want some bubblegum. The characters are lovable and you feel empathy for their plights. I couldn't put it down.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very helpful and easy to use techniques! I think all couples should read this book before they decide to marry. It was a big factor in my soon to be marriage to my fiance!

B00933JF74|5.0|its cute and addictive. for two bucks i cant complain. the free one is great but the banner drove me nuts so i didnt see nothing wrong about spending it to rid myself of the banner and have all the other cute decorum unlocked. :)
B004Q08BE2|3.0|I did not see this when it came out. With all the recognition it received I expected more. It seemed very predictable to me . Acting was good and dancing was good, but really, do really have to be literarily in people's faces and laps to get a sex scene across. And do we really have to make 50% or more of the story about sex when it's not a porn film. God America , and Hollywood , grow up! We've seen it all and do we really have to keep acting like  6 year olds over a dirty word  and act like the most base act in nature is the big attraction we center are life's around and the media persists on using as its main ploy to sell us watered down crap ( entertainment) without a well written sentence or original story line.<br />Natalie Portman always a pro, film good but not great and certainly not a film for the ages or the under aged .
B007SNMYNS|5.0|\\"Wheat Belly\\" is a must read, especially for the healthy, who may be unaware that consuming foods endorsed by the powers that be may be attacking them like a cancer, unawares. Decisions in high places are rarely driven by compassion as much as for profit. Still, accept  no authority, including this book's author, until you are satisfied by your own research. This is the golden rule when making all ultimate \\"Life Decisions.\\" His thesis runs contrary to almost all prevailing guidelines, but he defends his position eloquently, extensively, and with a captivating writing style. Remember Mark Twin's famous line: \\"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.\\"
B0085Z3AMW|4.0|The quality of this Blu ray is rather skewed. Because the movie itself isn't the best Myers installment. But as a whole, this Blu ray is better than any DVD release of this title.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A page turner. the book kept my interest but it was not as good as some of the previous Lee Child Reacher novels that I have read
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|I don't know but it's the old &#34;a star  is born&#34; story done yet again. Some nice dancing spots, and the ending had a little surprise ( yes, little) but all and all not that much going on . The filming was good to bad there wasn't more story and less camp to go with it. Would want to pay more than .99 cents to see it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great movie. Highly recommended.  I really wish I could just rate this movie without having to write a stupid review.
0316228532|4.0|Rowling made an incredibly smart decision going with an adult novel as her next endeavor, but I was surprised just how mature the content of this book was. However, it did not bother me at all because it fit the characters and the world she was trying to create (and I'm a George RR Martin fan, so it's pretty hard to shock me with adult content).<br /><br />This is a book that is clearly meant to be an extremely pessimistic view of the life of the people in a small town like Pagford. This is not a failure on her part but instead a success! One must be ready to read through the entire book because one is not going to get any hope throughout. The ending indicates that this was intentional, and this made her narrative much more powerful. The ending comes with just the right amount of tragedy, pain, loss, AND hope. The hope cannot be too great or it would be unrealistic, but she shows that people who have done great wrongs can achieve redemption.<br /><br />I give the book four stars because it could have been drastically shorter (closer to 400 pages I'd say), which would have made it much easier for people to get through. It is a challenge to trudge though the litany of characters and their terrible lives in the beginning of the book, but the ending makes it completely worth it. This is nowhere near as great of a work as Harry Potter, and it is not worthy of the same respect that HP is. That said, this book was not meant to be the next Harry Potter. It was meant to be another book by Rowling that explored certain themes, and it did that.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very Interesting book where you want to know how is the cause that took Christian Grey turns like it...<br />And how Ana Steel got involved for Christian Grey.
159413586X|2.0|This book was very disappointing, I read it all just because it was the last one.  I liked the bigger print. I recieved the books within 5 days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked this book. In fact, I really liked the entire trilogy,even though I read the first book on a whim. I definitely recommend.
B009IJJ712|5.0|So far well written. Who knew the latest incarnation of the original \\"dynamic duo\\" would captivate my attention as it has?
B000VBP382|1.0|This movie was a complete disaster. The first thing I found distasteful was Mrs. Bennett. She is portrayed as a hysterical woman with not an ounce of decency or proper manners. She seems to delights in behaving outrageously inappropriate, even breaching proper etiquette. Her daughters, apart from Jane, are portrayed as silly, simpering girls, with no regard for propriety or even common sense. Elizabeth Bennet, portrayed by Keira Knightly, does no credit to the character she is supposed to be portraying. She comes across as snooty, judgmental and often just as silly as Mrs. Bennett and her sisters. She shows no respect for those of superior rank, or even her own parents. Mr. Darcy is portrayed as dull, rather then proud and arrogant. The actress portraying Miss. Carline Bingley would have made a fine Mr. Darcy. In this movie, Mr. Darcy comes across as more nervous and afraid then proud. In fact, in many scenes, he almost looks as if he is about to burst into tears. The only character I actually tolerated was Jane. She, in my opinion, is the only character in this movie that shows any charm or manners. However, like the rest of the cast, she too had no depth.<br />I found the setting of the Bennett home to be absolutely disgusting. The Bennett's are portrayed as extremely poor, so much so that they allow a pig to walk through the house. In the book, the Bennett's were upper middle class and did NOT live on a farm. They certainly would never have had barn animals in their home. Jane Austen would certainly be disgusted at this rediculous portrayal of one of her best works.
1594135851|5.0|This was good book, it was hard to put down.  I liked the bigger print. I recieved the books within 5 days.

030758836X|3.0|Gillian has two wonderful  talents.  She knows how to imagine a good story, and she knows how to write  it  in a special way.  She is able to go deep inside the emotions of a man and woman struggling to keep their marriage together, and present their situation with intense feeling,  but playful wording.  To be able to straddle both worlds like that is truly a unique gift.  And then she treats us to a plot twist that makes things even more complicated, yet still manages  to keep the linguists smiling.<br /><br />I would have gone on for many more paragraphs praising this book except for one basic flaw:  Although she knows how to write an amazing story, she doesn't know how to end one.  So she doesn't.  Maybe she ran out of paper, maybe she fractured her hand,  maybe she just got tired.  Or maybe she's hoping to write a sequel, forcing us to buy another book in order to finish this one.  I see that as literary blackmail.<br /><br />I give her five  stars for the plot/creative writing aspect and zero stars for the ending (or rather, lack of same), resulting in a three star rating.
0375507256|5.0|Excelent book.  A must read.  Now I hear they are making a movie of it with Tom Hanks and quite a few others.  Hope they do it justice.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I enjoyed more the deal I got with amazon on this movie!<br />The movie its the best super hero movie of all time, and having it in 3d dvd is priceless.
B002CNK1MK|5.0|This movie had some really good acting by Cruise and Hoffman. (spoiler alert)The way Hoffman portrayed Ray really reflected how someone who really is autistic might act. I give this movie a 5/5 for good acting, accurate representation, and an interesting storyline.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I had to watch this movie a second time in order to appreciate it for itself, rather than continually comparing it to the book.  The first time I watched it, I was shocked at how much they'd left out, and how fast the storyline moved forward.  I would have rated it 3 stars if I hadn't watched it again.<br /><br />Original story aside, the movie is very well done and the costuming is beautiful. Who would have thought that I'd think Henry VIII is sexy?  Nice choice of actor for that role.  Watching it a second time, for those who haven't read the book, will allow you catch more of the subtleties (sp?) that explain the actions of the players.  They're easy to miss on the first run through because you're following the broader storyline instead.<br /><br />Well worth watching (a couple times) but forget the book and just enjoy the movie for its own merits.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am a chronic abused of snooze buttons, can reset a regular alarm and go back to sleep within seconds, and have had three alarms to wake me in the morning in the past. Having to do math problems, shake my kindle, or enter a captcha works for me. This alarm app is near-perfect. I just wish there was a random mode that would surprise me with the method to tun off the alarm--after a few days of the same method I get a little too good for it and I don't always remember to switch it up myself.<br />Overall, this app has been a job- and a marriage-saver. Hubby is very happy he doesn't have to hear my alarm go off a half-dozen times in the morning!

0062124293|2.0|I just don't like her style of writing. I wanted to so I kept reading and reading hoping I'd get to a point where it flowed for me. Finally I threw in the towel. I think honestly it may just be a culture gap. I've never been fond of British comedy so I just wrote this off to my not understanding her British style of communicating. It's collecting dust now until I find someone to give it to or include it in my next library donation box.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I dont mind the adverts that are silent but auto playing video adverts are the devil. At least offer some sort of ability to pay to remove them.
B000IZA9NK|4.0|I personally enjoyed the 40s camp style of this movie. I thought the story was good, the acting appropriate for what was trying to be captured. The special effects were good, but not over dobe adding to the flavor of its intent to be a story from the past.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent read!  Lots of action, suspense, & intrigue. Reacher's knowledge of state histories & law enforcement<br />practices & regulations is amazing.  Lee Childs gives so much attention to detail.  Hard to put down!<br />(Kindle book from Amazon)
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I would like to provide my commentary for the ending, but then that would destroy the events leading up to the ending for someone who has not yet seen the movie. Liam Neeson is a great actor and possibly viewed by many as a magician who can accomplish anything. The producer should have factored that in when creating his ending.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|We thought it was refreshing, unique good story line and had many exciting over the top effects. As long as you can get over it being our president abe lincoln in our history books it is worth watching. I'm not saying it a must see outstanding movie.... but it is worth watching if you like vampire movies in which the vamps don't sparkle in the sunlight. Happily It's not a teen vamp movie. Dark and gritty.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent and very plausible science fiction, which made this an entertaining and thought-provoking novel.  Well-written, good character development - all in all, a great read.  I immediately purchased the first installment of the prequel - Legacy - and can't wait for the next one.

Both great artists still. Yet we evolve or devolve. Back then it had to have a beat and be danceable, as Dick Clark always said on  AB. I do not listen to rap. I like Kanye. 808's the best. This disc by Ocean. Well first of all, it gliiides. It has some very interesting melodies and melodic fragments. To me, a songwriter also, he sounds like an experimenter. He is trying to engage something down  where its tangled and dark. There is genuine talent in these grooves. Listened to it for a whole week. It is not angry to me. There's too much positive energy coming from him to be an angry young rapper. Heav3n knows that's yesterday and overdone as day=old bacon. I think he has a chance of doing something really great. Hope he has the patience to ride his grooves, use his voice, and let the phone ring when the record company is scratching at him for a followup to this one.[[ASIN:1455502782 Arguably: Essays by Christopher Hitchens]]

Aha!!\\" Sort of moments.<br /><br />This is most certainly a clever movie throughout and the end to cap it off the way it did, earns without question, 5 stars. I'll be happy to watch this movie again soon!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book. Very well written of an amazing warriors story. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in military writing.
159420411X|4.0|I have read about 1/2 of the book and i am enjoying it. He also has extensive footnotes which shows that he has gone into these issues very thoroughly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's great except that you can only play random deal if you don't have wi ti but other than that I reccomend it for people of all ages
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I enjoyed Martin's Game of Thrones.  Even though there are many characters to follow, their stories grow so compelling that keeping track of them becomes easy.  Fans of Arthurian legends, fantasy, and history will find something to love in Martin's A Game of Thrones.  Read it!!!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This would normally be my kind of novel - it has solid premises, interesting situations, and takes chances with the strange. It also breaks down barriers between genres, featuring six very different settings and points of view. Constructed like a palindrome, with each story interrupted by one that takes place later in time, the novel laces its parts together through imagery (a shared birthmark) and through characters \\"witnessing\\" the life of other characters. Thematic parallels like enslavement and unjust exploitation also connect the disparate stories: among tribes and shipmates in the South Pacific and on the high seas; among musicians in Belgium; among power companies and journalists in 1970s America; among vanity publishing in the UK; among genetically manipulated workers in near-future Korea; and among post-apocalyptic tribes in Hawaii.<br /><br />Unfortunately all this clever construction seemed to be the point. Unlike Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, Michael Cunningham's the Hours, and the film Memento, the structure was not a necessary or natural part of the overall story. Rather it felt like Mitchell wanted to combine different genres first then set about figuring out how to do it. The result is a writing exercise (by a clearly talented writer) rather than an inspired work of literature that sticks with you. (One reviewer said it well: the day after he finished the novel it started to fade from his memory.) Just like it takes more than the same fabric or the same colors to tie disparate pieces of a fashion collection together, it takes more than a birthmark and \\"seeing another's life\\" to create something cohesive with lasting impact.<br /><br />Having said that, I applaud Mitchell for attempting it and Sceptre and the Modern Library for publishing it. Cloud Atlas is a clear improvement on Ghostwritten (liked the premise; was bored by the action), suggesting Mitchell's next book could be the revolutionary one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. and I use it all the time.  When I am grocery shopping I punch kn my purchases so there are no surprises at checkout.
B009157BWU|5.0|My youngest son loves animals. So I rented this for him. We watched it about 5 times. He loved it and so did I.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Very Addictive! Highly recommended and it is free. You will not be disappointed. Get it now.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I love this set. It came with a separate disc for Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and a disc with code that unlocks the digital copy. The code also unlocks the soundtrack for digital download. I wasn't really aware of the soundtrack in the film, but it was a great buy with all these versions of the film and at such a great low price from amazon.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|great app ever I get to see were I never thought I would  of sal when my bro sees it he laughs at me :(
1476712042|5.0|I've waited a long time to read this book, not because I was on the fence about it, but because I couldn't decide what version I wanted to get! I'm so glad that I chose to get it in print, now I can keep this beautifully written story in my cluster of amazing books that I am truly fond of.<br /><br />With that being said, on with the review!<br /><br />There comes a time when you find a book that literally sucks you in, pulls at your emotions and senses, drags you along for the long haul, draws out your anger and frustration, and makes you laugh one minute and say \\"Aww!\\" the next. This book did all of those things for me! It took me TWO days to read the entire novel and once I was finished, I felt completely invested.<br /><br />Travis Maddox is this kind of guy that you want to save and cuddle one minute, and the next you want to strangle him! And he is sexy as hell too boot. I have known several Travis' in my time so I was completely sucked into his story.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy confused the hell out of me at times. At first I thought I knew what she was gonna do, and the next she surprised me to no end! There were times throughout the book that I thought she gave in to Travis' demands a little too soon, but whatever. To each their own. Love does crazy things to people, and I think these two are PERFECT for each other!<br /><br />Jamie McGuire has written herself an amazing story and I am so happy to have experienced it with countless others. As a writer myself, it's not always easy to put pen to paper, to get the right words to flow with the story, but Ms. McGuire has done just that.<br /><br />Kudos, Ms. McGuire, and thank you for sharing this amazing story with us all!<br /><br />Flora Roberts~

B008MZPVP4|5.0|When the mailman came with the package I was stoned with the quality! This is the best record I bought this year! 6 tracks, like Phillip said: \\"All killer, no filler\\". It's so beautiful to look at the album cover when i'm listening to it, awesome work from the DOWN guys!
B004J09ONG|5.0|This is a a must watch, feel good movie for all ages. You might feel the initial 15 min slow but the story develops from there.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The whole 50 shade trilogy was really good. It took me awhile to decide to read them but once I did, I couldn't stop.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have been using Amazon MP3 for several years, and it has never disappointed!  On all of my devices, phones, tablets, and laptop it has always worked well.  The selection is infinite, clearly I am a fan!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I mean, what else is there to say, really? This book is intense. I was afraid another Twilight drama was taking the world by storm yet again, but after reading this book, it is more than obvious why it has. Truly an incredible masterpiece!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Great watch for the price. You won't find a cheaper automatic for the quality you are getting.  Wish it was a sapphire display, but not a big deal
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Never disappointed when reading his books. Mind you it is hard to see how the third book will be able to maintain the global rivalry
B0090O07RS|5.0|That is my one and only complaint -- I wanted more. This is perhaps the best filmed rock concert of all time. Visually, sonically, musically, this is an absolutely amazing concert. I don't care if you're just a casual Doors fan, or a devout Doors fan, you must buy this film. It will bring you right back to 1968, as if you were in the front row, experiencing the Doors at their absolute best. This is truly an amazing concert, beautifully filmed, with state-of-the-art sound, and the band at their best. Truly amazing. If I could give it more than five stars, I would.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Bought this memory for my Synology 1812+ Nas.  The Nas came with 1gb installed which was fine, but for under $13 why not max it out.  Installed and back up and running in under 10 minutes.  No problems installing, now have a total of 3gb of memory.  I believe that 3gb is the max but have read some people ran into problems running 4gb.  So I just played it safe and went with 1 2gb stick for the upgrade to 3gb.  Good video on YouTube of how to install on the 1812+. [...]

B0071XO8RA|5.0|And that's saying something. I grew up in a house full of science fiction novels and cut my teeth on things like The Forever War and Earth Abides. Wool is marvelously conceived and executed.  It's been years since I was sucked into a book enough to read it in one sitting but I couldn't put this down.

B008578PMU|4.0|i had heard about Red Tails when it first came out and was anxious to see it. a good movie about a bunch of guys who never got the respect they deserved after the war. the action scenes were some of the best ever for a WW2 air warfare movie.
B008OJ291W|1.0|The music is flatter and muted overall. It's an artificial construct, sounding like the efforts of one man in his home studio, playing all the instruments, and digitally mimicing the rest. What's missing, is the magic, that the original musicians, skilled in their craft, contributed to these classics. The drums are less crisp; cymbals sound digital - even the fire alarm on Mr. Blue Sky lost its spark. The digital sounds are obvious on choral effects. Kelly's absence is notable throughout. And Livin' Thing without Mik is D.O.A.<br /><br />The whole album just sounds artificial and fake throughout, that's all.<br /><br />Given the frequency of ELO songs used in movies and tv commercials, I wonder if Lynne's intent was to rerecord these classics for future use in those media. I'd hate to think that he did it to excise the contributions (and royalties) of his former band-mates, as some form of retribution for ELO pt 2.<br /><br />I've been a long-time ELO/Lynne fan. I even flew down to LA to see his two concerts from the aborted Zoom tour. This collection just does nothing for me. First of two fails in his career. The other is Long Wave, a listless 27 minute tribute to his influences, that makes the originals seem that much better.<br />.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection of books was well worth the read - I couldn't put it down.  Great characters, engrossing story and completely believable. I will be reading more by Hugh Howey!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like seeing all the information about the battery life in an easy to understand format. No guessing how much time I have before I need to plug in! It tells me exactly how much battery time I have left.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This well written first person narrative comes from a whole new perspective for my book club and me.  The story evoked a huge range of emotional responses among us and also led us to some fabulous discussions.  It was a real page turner for me!
B008Y5OW20|1.0|None of these songs compare to their iconic renditions. Listen to \\"Smile\\", \\"She\\" or \\"Running Scared\\" side by side with the Nat King Cole, Charles Aznavour or Roy Orbison versions, and it's quite clear that Jeff isn't up to the task. The instrumentation is listless, often plodding. He sings like he's swallowing his words. And it's only 27 minutes long? Guess he didn't have many influences.<br /><br />And I've been a long-time ELO/Lynne fan. I even flew down to LA to see his two concerts from the aborted Zoom tour.

B0057UD49M|5.0|my jaw was literally on the floow when i read Alison Bechdel's Fun Home -- more than once, sometimes for eloquence, sometimes for recognition, sometimes just because i was finally reading a comic book i could relate to. brilliant decision to illustrate and tell her story this way, i'd give this book to anyone who is grown up and might have had even a sliver of a similar experience.
B000I9YWN4|5.0|just have fun and enjoy the ride, great performance from queen latifa. i am not a race car fan but his movie is so well done that i had the greatest fun for a long time.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Crossed   is a   great  book .It makes you get super excited for Reached!  i like how it the book it has different point of views between Cassia and Ky. The new introduced characters are well thought out too! Overall the book was great inside and out .Can't  wait for Reached!!!

B009439HEY|5.0|I am not going to get very wordy here, but any Genesis fan has got to own this CD.  The reworkings of the songs sound absolutely fantastic.  The sonic quality is absolutely amazing.  Great singers who sound very similar to Peter and Phil. Steve's playing is better than ever, and mixed correctly. This CD has not left my player since I received it.  Buy it now!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those stories that makes you want more: how did they get there? What happened next? I hope there are more Wool tales in the future!
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Ken Follett has returned to his masterful best in this book. When he writes in the historical fiction genre he is superb. This book is beautifully crafted to provide a memorable picture of Europe before, during and after the Second World War. By linking families in Britain, Wales, Germany and Russia he is able to see the war from several perspectives. This book paints war for what it is: a grotesque waste of human lives that serves little purpose and leaves everyone poorer in spirit.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved the book. I love gideon and eva, their storys were very sad and realistic. The whole story from cary to exes is great. I cant wait for book three. Sylvia Day out done her self. I have these books more than once and I would recomend them to friends. Until Entwined in you...
B007FG9LIE|3.0|The plot was excellent but the character reactions were at times not believable and at the end several things were left unexplained.
1451620829|2.0|Wow, where do I begin?  First off, I've been a Kiss fan since 1976 (from when I was 10 years old).  I've followed Kiss throughout my life and would probably consider myself a diehard fan.  I read Peter's book and right off the bat, it's apparent that he did not actually write this book; Sloman did.  Peter is not that articulate.  It's also apparent that Peter never really evolved as a responsible adult.  Most of the points that were made in this book should have been written by a high school sophomore.  Very immature.  (dick size, mind games, power, control, money)<br /><br />He whines about Paul and Gene throughout the book like a child. (I'm really surprised he didn't blame 9/11 on both of them)  He complains that Paul and Gene were all about the money and that he was all about the music and having fun in Rock and Roll.  But then he complains that he wasn't paid enough during the Reunion and subsequent tours.  (a tad bit hypocritical)<br /><br />He continually states throughout the book that he's always been a devout Catholic and that he's very close to God.<br />I'm a Catholic myself (admittedly non-practicing) and I don't remember the Catholic church teaching that it is ok to do coke, heroine, and weed and consistently commit adultery.  But I may have missed that Sunday teaching.<br /><br />He claims that he's a very honest person in the book.  I'm not buyin it.  There were lots of embellishments.<br /><br />And I loved how he would mention that when Kiss was on a low-cycle of popularity (non-makeup years), it was because he and Ace were not in the band.  Talk about delusional ego!<br /><br />I can go on and on about how ludicrous this book is, but I don't have the time.  Peter should be embarassed by this book, but due to his immaturity he probably won't be.<br /><br />One thing I did learn from this book is that every Kiss fan should be grateful to Paul and Gene for keeping the band (in one form or another) alive and well.  Kiss would not have existed if it wasn't for them. Thank you Paul and Gene.<br />Can you imagine Peter trying to keep Kiss alive?  Instead of opening with Deuce or Modern Day Delilah, they could open with Send in the Clowns.  Horrible.sn't for them. Thank you Paul and Gene.<br />Can you imagine Peter trying to keep Kiss alive?  Instead of opening with Deuce or Modern Day Delilah, they could open with Send in the Clowns.  Horrible.
B008B8DWDU|4.0|So where do do I start? This book kept me captivated from the very beginning taking me to the land if stories where (let's face it) EVERYONE dreamed of going in their childhood. The mishmash of fairy tales throughout the book made you laugh,smile,cry all leaving behind  their correct morals. If you live fairy tales with a twist you will LOVE this book - age doesn't matter!!!!!
1615746250|5.0|I love the book Graceling, and now having it in an audiobook is perfect for my long drive to work!  The Playaway format works perfectly.  I just had to put in new batteries and plug in my own headphones.  If I find any other good audiobooks in this format I will buy them!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great to play when your on a break at work.. its even mire fun when your on a long car ride and can listen to mysic at the same time. but when your in the mood to play a constantly exciting game this isnt what you wqnt but otherwise this is a VRY FUN GAME!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading this and came straightaway to say \\"You must read this book. It is just wonderful!\\"<br /><br />It is interesting, imaginative, well written, and everything a great book should be.  The language is beautiful and different without being labored. The descriptions are seamless with the story. The characters are heroic and flawed and indecisive and evil, just like we are.<br /><br />It is science fiction but so well written that even readers generally put off by that genre might want to grab this one. It is very cross genre in its style and I believe most readers will find it interesting and increasingly interesting as you read.  And it just keeps getting better and better as you go.<br /><br />I found nothing too predictable about it, and the obstacles resolved are done so reasonably.  A very well crafted story.  Well done!  It really is a fascinating dystopian world he has created, and I so look forward to reading more about it!<br /><br />Now I am off to find his other books to read.<br /><br />* If you are interested in the book, and have questions before you buy, you may contact me about it.  My reviews are general to avoid spoilers. I do love to encourage reading, however, and I would be pleased to help in any way. I taught English for years and was a school librarian for a time, so there ya go! :)
B005I0DUMC|4.0|I had not seen this film before buying it. I read some reviews & thought I'd take a chance. The price was right too. Not a bad movie at all.  It was a different type of role for Sly, but I think he pulled it off pretty good. It has an All-Star cast too. The Blu-Ray quality I'd have to say is pretty good. I don't re-call any really bad scenes. I can't comment on the quality of the audio as I listen through external speakers from my tuner which is only in stereo. The aspect ratio is 1:85:1 which I don't really like. It fills your screen, but you miss more of the movie on each end. Overall I liked this movie & am glad I bought it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is amazing. the cliffhanger will make me read the next one. i want to see the capital burn in hell
1423140605|5.0|this book is great i will not give anything way but readers be prepared the ending will take you by surprised another thing i would say that you should get a copy of the  audio book the book it s great but if you too fast you may miss details but still a great book Rick Riordan you did it  again
B009GEEMLY|5.0|If you like comic book heros you'll love this movie.  I like adventure movies with heros.  You don't have to BELIEVE that it is real, just IMAGINE it.  Very entertaining.  Loved it.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It has a great cast & is enjoyable to watch each time I see it. The Blu-Ray is really nice on this film & the color is exceptionally nice too. I'm glad they put this in 2:35:1 aspect ratio so you can see the whole movie as the director  wanted it to be seen in. I had to wait a little while for this to come down into my price range & when it did I scooped it up. I have the dvd & it is like night & day between the {2} versions. I don't think you can go wrong buying this film. I'm sure you will enjoy the quality as much as I do.

B004XVN1T4|5.0|Loved this book. Ken Follett to me is a fantastic writer. I get so involved with his stories i have a hard time putting them down. If you like high action and chases and spies...give this book a go.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I am still simmering from just having watched Under The Red Hood.  I've seen a lot of Batman in my time, and a lot of really great animation, but not quite anything quite as dark, as successfully paced, as beautifully animated and as carefully crafted as this.  At least not in a very long time.<br /><br />Without giving up any spoilers, I will simply say that this very brutal tale gets to the depths of evil and permanence within the first five minutes before the pre-movie credits.  I found the voice of nearly all of the characters to be wonderfully selected.  As a huge fan of Futurama, I didn't even recognize that the Joker was played by John DiMaggio (in deference to some reviews I've seen saying it was distracting).  I found the Joker in particular to be very scary, very interestingly drawn and voiced, a terrifying and yet pathetic maniac.<br /><br />*Edit* - I wrote the paragraph below before reading a review saying that the extras on the Blu-Ray edition stunk and are not remotely worthwhile.  So I guess having no extras is okay in this case. ;)<br /><br />I am reviewing the Single-Disc DVD; at this time the only other edition is the Blu-Ray.  I have no interest in Blu-Ray personally, and am frustrated that there are no extras at all on this edition of the movie.  Not only is the Blu-Ray more than three times the cost of this edition as of this writing, but there's no reason the extras wouldn't have fit on the regular DVD; they're just not there out of spite from the publisher (the movie is about 70 minutes long, plenty of space left).  But that's really my only complaint.<br /><br />Fantastic story weaving other stories of the Dark Knight, with bits I believe from the Killing Joke and other dark Batman tales.  Well worth a watch, just be prepared for something serious, and don't bring the young kids.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|The dance scenes are amazing...  Channing Tatum is a very talented man and think its amazing that the actor did all of the dance combinations...  No body doubles...  I just have on regret, I wish I was that stage for a few of those shows!!!

B0091REZMW|3.0|I like going from room to room, but you need so many diamonds, tokens, and coins that it takes away the fun aspect of the game. Also, having to go back into the same a dozen times is ludicrous and boring. Then there's the fact that are searching for the same items each time. Improve,  improve.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have had my kindle for a year now and I LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE!!!!!! I'm a mom of three so sitting in the car doing the drop off/pick up I can read play games or if their is a nearby wifi get online. In bed and around the house its small enough to hold and do whatever. If I cant sleep at night I get to watch free prime movies with headphones so I don't wake my husband. I can download apps for homework, recipes, anything! My kids love using it, my husband loves using it while he soaks in the tub. The prime membership has way way more than paid for itself. I don't like going shopping so when I need anything from birthday presents to household items and too much more to list, I get usually a better deal on amazon, free 2 day shipping and front door delivery. They have never missplaced anything and always replace damaged items and are great with returns! I cant say enough about it. Especially for moms when we have such few and random \\"us\\" time. This fills it perfectly! Get it!!!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Funny at times and gut-wrenching at others, this book kept me hooked. Lord Henry, an influence on Doria, said the most oxymoronic stuff, sometimes funny and awful at the same time. I had read that in reading Oscar Wilde, this book was a great place to start. I wound up reading the importance of being earnest and I can tell you this was a much better starting point. This books heavier in subject matter but much better overall.

B00845MRKE|5.0|To be honest, a price tag of $60 is pretty steep for the items included. Especially if you already own the 2007 final cut on blu ray. This is because the special features included on the discs are the same; no difference. If you're like me though, and don't have Blade Runner on blu ray, this is an alright deal. It all depends on how much you want the lenticular, art/archive book and the miniature Spinner, and also how big of a die hard Blade Runner fan you are. I had some amazon gift cards, so I got this for $35. I feel that that is a fair value. I probably would not have purchased this if I had to cash out $60. I would have just sticked to the Director's Cut. Luckily that's not that case though I guess!<br /><br />Also, the digital copy is not an iTunes copy. As far as I'm aware, there is no way to import the digital copy into iTunes. It does say though that you can put it on your iPhone, so I don't really know how that works out. Oh, and The DVD copy is only of the final cut, not the original theatrical, international theatrical, or the director's cut.<br /><br />Hope this helped in some fashion...

B0042RUMIW|5.0|This is sting at his most playful, superb arrangements and virtuoso performances from everyone on stage. He is actually enjoying himself instead of his usual stoicism.
