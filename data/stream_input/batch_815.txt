B000002LCI|4.0|I am an avid fan of DM, and will do the best job at being objective about their work. Although, I think this album is great and it has many quintessential DM songs, there are some songs that I often skip over. These songs are definitely not my favorites, but I think mostly that they just don't appeal to me in the context of this album. This is why I label this \\"transitions\\". I love all periods of DM, but I notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier \\"new wave\\" feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of DM. I tend to prefer the darker DM, but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously. If you are even a slight fan of their work, you will enjoy this album.
B000FA57US|3.0|Well, this if the first Halloween movie after part 3 that is not getting good reviews. It had a terrible release and most fans I know hate this movie. I aapologize for my other Halloween reviews being so short, but I really dont have much to say, so this is my review of Halloween 5.<br /><br />Well, first we flashback to the end of Halloween 4, when Jamie stabs her stepmother to death. Now we cut to present, Jamie is in a mental institution, and is mute, needing the help of several doctors including Loomis. The whole concept of having Jamie mute kinda ruins alittle bit of the story for me, plus its probably a pain to act that way.<br /><br />Anyways, Jamie has a friend at the institution named Billy who has stuttering problems. He's oviously got something for Jamie, with his charm towards her. In a few moments, Rachel enters with a friend named Tina. Now to put on the record, I hated the Tina character. Just a snob, 80s bitch. She is so loud and has a terrible singing voice when she attempts that in the film. But now we'll go to the main character in the film, Michael. Well, we cut to the mine shaft we was blown into and crushed, but as we see in this, he squeezes between rocks, and then gets pulled down the current of a river, and wipes up shore of some random voodoo guy that lives near the river. He takes Michael in, thinking hes dead, but then Michael comes alive. He grabs the mask off the wall, and kills the man.<br /><br />Now, Michael is after Jamie, and tries to hunt down her location, but he soon finds Rachel at the house, and a couple more minutes into the scene kills her, much to mine, and alot of Halloween fans anger. They might as well of just killed her in part 4 if that were the case. Then (oh god!) Tina shows up at the house, wondering where Rachel is.<br /><br />Now not too much happens in the film throughout, but then we meet Tina's punk boyfriend Mike, who acts like a total big shot with a mulletin sunglasses and drves a dumbass car. Luckily, this guy doesn't last too long as getting jabbed with a pitchfork on his car. (HA!). Now there is some Halloween costume party at Jamie's clinic, where Bily dresses up as a pirate and kisses her. Off top of my head I forgot what Jamie was, but I think it was something like a ballerina or a fairy, comment and correct me if I'm wrong, but soon things go wrong at the party, and she is running in the streets (with her voice back), and eventually meets Michael, where he is DRIVING A CAR chasing her, but then the drunk driving Michael crashes into a tree and is still after Jamie.<br /><br />I forgot to mention, throughout the film, this guy wearing a black top had and a black cloak, shows up with a really odd triangle shape on his wrist, appearng throughout the movie, unidentified and noticed by people, which made half of america say \\"WTF!\\".<br /><br />The main finale of this movie takes place in Michael Myers childhood home, including a fun laundry shoot scene, and an awesome scene with Donald Pleasence losing hit and beating Michael to death. Then thats pretty much the whole movie, it was just released too soon after 4, and the \\"man in black\\" sure didn't help reputation of the film, but it was OK in my opinion, I gave it a 3/5.getting jabbed with a pitchfork on his car.

B000YABYLA|5.0|At first sight it would seem we are in front an amusing portrait about an irreverent girl who has been pregnant by his immature boyfriend a teenager who is really much more worried about a competence, absolutely unaware about the next role he should keep in mind in the next months to come.<br /><br />On the other hand the stoic attitude of this smart little woman about the way she regards the affectively broken universe adult environment that surrounds her. Her parents are divorced an each one lives with his respective couple. We will never know about her mother, jut by a simple reference, she always sends her a cactus in her anniversary. On the other hand, her father is a patient and abnegate man who tries to aim his daughter in every moment and her stepmother, who experiences the most notable transformation in the film.<br /><br />She becomes aware she is not prepared yet to educate her baby and so she decides to contact a young couple, in order to adopt him. Along the way we will witness the progressive affective crumbling of this couple.<br /><br />An original proposal around this sensitive drama of the adolescent mothers.

B000YRY8BG|4.0|\\"State Of Play\\" (2003) This BBC-produced miniseries is a taut, intelligent political thriller with fine acting contributions, notably from the venerable Bill Nighy, who plays an arch, politically savvy newspaper editor. A series of seemingly random killings appear to be linked by ties to a multinational oil conglomerate... and our heroes have to discover the truth of what happened, lest more lives be lost. If you like thrillers that aren't packed with overly-recognizable A-list Hollywood types, then this one's for you!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
0670020745|3.0|I thought that this book started off very well.  Her description of the stroke itself and her inner \\"analysis\\" of what was happening to her was quite novel.  Her frustration at other people's inability to understand what was happening to her was revealing.  But then it all seemed to turn into New Age gunk.  I am not unfamiliar with left brain-right brain logic vs. intuition (although her explanations are somewhat oversimplified), and believe that there is clear validity for this concept.  However, the last chapters (when she describes engaging her right brain) are very repetitive, almost like she really can't clearly describe what it is she's trying to say (not enough left brain?).  It got quite boring, and I found myself skimming pages.
0375826726|3.0|I believe as most people do that this book was just too wordy! There was no plot to it and nothing really goes together. I had a hard time keeping my attention in the book and often found my mind wander and had to read paragraphs over and over because I just couldnt keep my attention on the book. I also would have like for there have been more to do with Arya instead of just at the beginning.     My BIGGEST question in my mind that I wanted to know at the end of the book is \\"What did the Menoa Tree take from Eragon\\"? I am hoping that with the background story of the tree that she did not take the love he had for Arya away. I read deeply as I could after that with every part that had Arya in it and could find no hints to if that was the answer as he just acted normally as a friend would. Unlike some of these reviews I have read I would love for Eragon and Arya to be together and it would be even greater if Arya became the other rider too. I do not believe it matters how old she is, for one she doesnt look it, and now Eragon is part elf so will age slower also. It would be GREAT if they had one of the Rare Elf children too!    Overall I loved Eragon and Eldest best of course. This one was way to wordy for me and in that I will not have to re-read it when book 4 comes out as there is not much to remember. A book needs to hold my attention with the suspense and questions of what is to come next and this one just didnt do it.    Oh and I Sure hope the Eldest and Brisngr movie will be MUCH better than the first one because they just Mutilated the movie from the book and left out key points of the book. I was dissappointed it didnt show the Star Sapphire, Solembum, and the two main things that irked me were;     1: What happened to Durza giving him the scar and Saphira and Arya breaking the Sapphire  2: Also what is up with Arya and Eragon departing at the end when they live together for Ellesmera in the 2nd book after Ajihad dies  They will have alot to make up for if they continue the moves and Murtagh is NOT how I envisioned him he looks younger than Eragon to me in the movie not older like he is suppoused to.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies about some true heroes. The soldiers in this movie were truly inspiring and will never be forgotten.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|Do yourself a favor - if you are a fan of this film, DO NOT BUY THE ULTIMATE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!! You will regret it immediately. Animated transitions from scene to scene? The heavy handed Anabasis crap that they shoehorned into the story? Even the clarity of the images threw me off!  Put it this way - two minutes into the UDC DVD, I was back on Amazon to purchase the original version. Yes - the audio has been cleaned up - so tf what? Walter Hill is one director who is clearly out of touch with the impact of his own work. It should've never been touched! This film demands its grain. It demands the classic look and feel that gave it its classic cult status. I know there are cinephiles out there who must have everything in HD, BluRay, whatever. Don't do it. Some things should stay old school.
B00151HZME|2.0|This is my first album from M83, but certainly not the first time I've heard Morgan Kibby's heavenly, dreamy vocals (from her band THE ROMANOVS).     Like the title for my review suggests, this album is very dreamlike. By that I mean that when we go to sleep and dream there are some parts that make sense, that fit, that were enjoyable to dream about. And then there are parts that we're like, \\"um, okay, that doesn't make any sense/I'd sooner wake up and forget I dreamt that.\\"     Out of 11 tracks on this album there were only 4 that really stood out for me.     The first was \\"You, Appearing\\" with its nice piano intro, after which some spacy background sounds and soothing vocals, male and female, merge in.     The highlight of the whole album (for me, at least), is track 3, \\"Skin of the Night\\". Again the piano intro, but it's Morgan Kibby's sweet breathy voice singing the ROMANOVS-esque lyrics that really make this track a winner with me.     \\"Couleurs\\" is very long, clocking in at over 8 minutes, but the soft techno beat is nice although it is a bit repetitive. A good track to chill out to.    The last half of \\"We Own the Sky\\" is also a bit repetitive, but sweetly so, again thanks to Morgan Kibby.     The booklet has the lyrics with a very photogenic person on each page.    Overall this album definitely has a soft techno and 80s feel to it, which is definitely a good thing. Don't be put off too much by my two star rating. It's basically just to let you know that you'll like a handful of songs, but don't expect to like all eleven of them.
B0007OY2P8|2.0|Sorry, I know this was shot in 1986, but I don't remember the rest of the films shot that year being THIS technically terrible.  The bad effects and film quality are so distracting, it actually makes the movie almost laughable.  Not a good quality in any film, let alone a period piece.    I'm not as familiar with this Jane Austen work as some of her others, but if her leading lady is as dreamy as portrayed here with so much internal fantasizing going on, you're going to need a special director to pull it off.  I assume she was meant to be portrayed as highly creative, idealistic, unprepared for any sort of reality - instead she seems like a ridiculous, immature twit - or maybe that was the acting.  I'd also be surprised if JA created her characters with so little depth or provided them with short, insipid text.    Honestly, I'd try another version.  I'm glad there are some because I'd written this one off.  Not worth the money, or even the time, to watch.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|You don't really hear a lot about Robocop anymore, but this really was one of the biggest films of the 1980s.  For a teenager like me, Robocop was the baddest dude in town back in 1987 - and now, twenty plus years later, he's still pretty much the baddest dude in town.  The film really hasn't aged much at all, which came as a pleasant surprise to me.  Some of the special effects involving the giant Enforcement Droid (ED-209) aren't impressive as they used to be, and that one shot looking down at someone falling to his death looks absolutely awful, but everything else, especially Robocop himself, works like gangbusters.  It's still quite a gritty film, with loads of realistic violence (vintage Paul Verhoeven, in other words).  In fact, Verhoeven had to edit out some of the film's over-the-top comic violence just to secure an R rating.  Even the political satire and emasculation of an overly exploitative mass media still ring quite true, as we intermittently watch a couple of newscasters smile and laugh their way through one tragic news story after another.  And those commercials!  The brand new 6000 SUX that gets an impressive 8.2 miles per gallon, all of the stupid \\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\" ads, etc.<br /><br />In this film's near-future setting, almost everything has been privatized, including hospitals and the entire police department of Detroit (now owned and run by the megacorporation Omni Consumer Products).  The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) has long dreamed of replacing Old Detroit altogether with his own marketed utopia, but he needs to get crime under control before he can make Delta City a reality.  Senior President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) claims to have the answer - a gigantic, fully automated, heavily-armed Enforcement Droid known as ED-209.  Unfortunately, ED's debut presentation runs into a pretty bloody \\"glitch.\\"  In steps Bob \\"It's All About Me\\" Morton (Miguel Ferrer) with his own idea of a part-human, part-cyborg super-cop.  When newly-transferred Detroit police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets brutally gunned down by the local crime boss and his henchmen, Robocop is born.  He's a darn good cop, as many a criminal lowlife in town soon learns, but there's just one problem - he begins to remember his human past, especially his death at the hands of Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his gang.  Whether or not what is left of Murphy ever recovers a measure of his humanity, though, one thing is certain - the bad guys are going to go down and go down hard.<br /><br />You'll find a few of the most memorable scenes of the 1980s in this film - the unveiling of ED-209, Robocop's highly skilled shooting of a purse-snatcher using his victim as cover, and the big throw down between Robocop and ED-209.  It's a great story with a great script, one that combines humor alongside lots of impressive violence and deep human themes (revenge, humanity, etc.).  The acting is also quite good up and down the line, with Kurtwood Smith (best known today as the dad on That 70's Show) turning in a particularly strong performance as a bad guy's bad guy.  This could have been nothing more than a high-tech shoot-em-up, and that alone would have made it a big summer box office hit, but Robocop is a much more complex film than you would normally expect, and that is why it continues to stand the test of time very well.

B0019HQIGS|5.0|This is a great album!  John plays three distinct sets - the first, mostly accoustic and by himself, is a lot of old favorites and some newer stuff - Set 2 is a blues bar set that you would swear John is channeling Stevie Ray Vaughan!  Great guitar work, driving blues, good stuff!  Set three is with the rest of the band, doing a lot of his newer stuff - it's a great album.

0345494997|3.0|I first saw this book displayed from a storefront window of a chain bookstore. It piqued my interest in what Nancy Horan had to say about the life of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney. I lived in both Taliesins (Spring Green and Taliesin West in Scottsdale). I wanted to compare how my perception of the history of Taliesin falls into place with how the author, who based the novel on extensive research, compares with my own impressions of the place. When I read the novel, I was filtering the storyline along these lines---that of an architect who lived at Taliesin for a span of three years. I was impressed with the choice of words, the language with which Ms Horan described the architectural spaces that Frank Lloyd Wright designed. While I knew of the general history of the fires at Taliesin and about Mamah Cheney, recounting the places from the Oak Park Home and Studio to Taliesin in Spring Green, to moving around Chicago, all these created a connection for me given my background. Some of the stories related to me became real for a moment, while I was reading the novel. I also can tell that the author did extensive research about Frank Lloyd Wright and his architecture, one of which is his autobiography, because I had read the same book prior to reading Loving Frank. This book allowed me to see through a different facet of such strong characters as they interact, fight, and collaborate. I found the book very amusing and intriguing, even though I knew what would happen to Mamah Cheney in the end. This did not dampen my interest in finishing the book.
0375826726|2.0|This book is too long winded. it describes every unimportant detail in excruciating and repetitive detail. Eragon faces moral dilemmas that he should of faced long ago. the author brings up random facts and characters to prolong the book. the storyline has NO turns. i could see almost every point coming from a mile away. His writing style has gotten much worse in an attempt to give us more information about his fantasy world.

B000002JB8|4.0|First, let me warn you that I am not an audiophile! I don't know a lot about music--especially on a more technical level.     I am amazed at Vangelis' creativity. This is my 3rd album of his, and each album has a different sound to it. Oceanic is very soothing and peaceful. It isn't his best album (IMHO), but I like it very well. As the title suggests, it has a \\"watery\\" sound to it--surf crashing throughout, and music that has lovely swaying, rhythmic tunes, like gentle waves, and crescendos like big waves crashing, and sweet voices like merpeople or the nixe. Overall, I feel as though Vangelis has succeeded in creating music with an aquatic sound; I think I would know this album was about the ocean even without the title and the sounds of surf.    We listen to it often, as in addition to being pleasant to listen to, it's also great background music. It doesn't distract me when I'm studying, or drown out dinner table conversation. Of the three Vangelis albums we have so far, I enjoy Oceanic less than The City, but more then Direct.
0307269191|5.0|I did not know Murakami's work at all before I purchased this book. I saw it in the running section at a bookstore and decided to give it a read. As I was purchasing the book the sales staff got very excited- turns out they were all huge fans. One person had even done her M.A. Dissertation on Murakami!     I was expecting some running inspiration. What was amazing is that I found an honest exploration into why someone does what they do, written in a way that was simple, moving, and eloquent. It had been so long that I cried when a book was over because it was so good, until I read this.     If you are a fan of Murakami, then the details of his life will be interesting, and are outlined very nicely by other reviewers here. If you are like me and not familiar with his celebrity, then what you will find is a moving memoir that is humble, insightful, and through its simplicities, leaves you changed. Even if you cannot relate to his perspective, you come to understand him and feel a sense of empathy.     If you are a runner, you will love this book, as Murakami speaks of his running rituals and motivations as metaphor for larger life lessons. If you are a writer, you will love this book, as Murakami illustrates some of the insights he has into himself as a writer and his writing process. If you just want a nice, easy read that is entertaining and touches the heart, you will love this book, because it does just that.
0553584537|3.0|As my title states, I didn't find this Lisa Gardner book very capturing at all. The only part that left me wanting to know more was about Catherine's son Nathan who is very ill. I'll chalk that up to my motherly instincts wanting to protect a child. Other than that, the whole story didn't really leave me wanting more like Lisa Gardner's other books that I have read. Perhaps you'll like it more than I did. I would still recommend it because I love Lisa's writing style.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|If you, like me, were a high school or college student during the \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"And Justice for All\\" days of Metallica, then you will not be disappointed with this album.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium have been out long enough now for one to realize, they aren't just a phase one goes through or a musical fad. In fact their sound has been heavily evolving since their debut \\"Ember to Inferno\\" burned upon us.<br /><br />With the release of Shogun, Trivium have drawn upon a mythical Chinese realm  a rather enticing one at that. Agreeing to enable both screaming and clean vocals this time around will hopefully allow both \\"Crusade\\" fans and \\"Ascendancy\\" fans to reunite with their beloved band. Opting Nick Raskilinecz over Jason Suecof in terms of production was a personal choice for the band to grow and develop. Nick has worked with bands like Velvet Revolver, Foo Fighters, and Stone Sour. He doesn't let us down here.<br /><br />The songs featured here are a bit on the longer less commercial side. One can draw Trivium's inspiration from a myriad of metal gods. Hints of Maiden, Metallica, and even Pantera are here.  \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" is the opening track which has been released online for quite sometime. Acoustic  opening, panning drums, and a powerfully smooth electric guitar cut the intro into a nice welcoming mat. \\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\\" bulks upon trilling guitars and a bumbling bass line. The album really kicks ones face in, and oddly enough it's what YOU want. Admitting \\"The Crusade\\" was a lighter album, the band wanted a return to power sound. Heavy, loud, thick, and captivating the album delivers.<br /><br />The songs hit upon a progressive nature, while less catchy then previous efforts the album has a higher replay value. Ascendancy track \\"Declaration\\" lightly tapped into what Shogun would appear to be. The production quality is pretty good, one is probably use to the giant gaps in production quality for Trivium have had 'make overs' every album. Ember was slugish and muddy with the underground feeling laced in, Ascendancy was very tight powerfully crisp drums and treble spiked guitars, Crusade went for a more thrashy small sound, Shogun has the guitars turned a tad bit down but releases a collage of sound. The metalcore sound still obviously lingers, as presented with \\"Insurrection\\".<br /><br /> Trivium have succeeded, even with Shogun released so close to Metallica's long awaited \\"Death Magnetic\\". The songs this time around are truly epics. Great album, couldn't believe they'd become so powerful again.d bit down but releases a collage of sound.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|It's nice to see the good reviews, I thought I would have to come in and defend my position which is so often the case with new albums from established groups.<br /><br />Metallica's biggest problem over the last few albums has been how high they set their own bar.  Think about it, when someone mentions Metal, who comes to mind first?  I'd venture to say its Metallica over 90 percent of the time.  Even after St. Anger it was hard to dislike a group that has so efficiently dominated the genre.  They continually redefined what Metal was, and what it could be.<br /><br />The Black Album for me was a great album, but it didnt feel like Metallica, it felt formulated.  Ballads and predictability have taken over since then.  Load, ReLoad, not total crap but definightly not what I wanted to hear from them as a fan.  ST. Anger . . . I think that James and Lars will look back at that as hitting \\"rock bottom\\".  Heh, which is a good thing . . .<br /><br />Death Magnetic . . .<br /><br />This album doesnt feel like \\"old school\\" Metallica, but more importantly it doesnt feel like they are trying to recapture \\"old school\\" Metallica.  The mark of greatness on their earlier albums was that they redefined the genre, with \\"Death Magnetic\\" they do it again.<br /><br />There is only one problem with this album that I can observe.  Whoever chose the first single really needs to be fired.  \\"All Nightmare Long\\" would have been so much better.  That is a heart pounding kick butt thrill ride from beginning to end.  It has great lyrics, and most importantly, it shows their hard side . . . wich would allow them to create some new fans as well as \\"re-enfranchising\\" old ones like me :-).<br /><br />This album should be considered redemption with a twist of revenge.  When Metallica sticks to their guns they are still among the best groups out there, and Death Magnetic proves it.<br /><br />Conclusion . . . this album is exactly what it should be, Metallica Reborn.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|David Gilmour not only still retains the amazing skill he has always had, he has even grown his talents, as can be witnessed here.

Here is why:    **** AMAZING PRODUCTION QUALITY, ON BOTH THE CDs AND THE DVDs    **** THE FINAL OFFICIAL RELEASE WHERE YOU ALSO GET TO SEE / HEAR PINK FLOYD KEYBOARDIST RICHARD WRIGHT    **** COMPLETE AND AMAZING 5.1 VERSION OF \\"ON AN ISLAND\\" ALBUM    **** GILMOUR, STILL AT THE VERY TOP OF HIS GAME, DEMONSTRATING NEW TALENTS, SUCH AS PLAYING THE SAXOPHONE!!    The only reason that I would hold off on buying this is if you hope that someday it will come out on BluRay (Which has not been announced to date).    Nonetheless, these standard DVDs look AMAZING on my 65\\" Mitsubishi HDTV.    This set, to me, really helps to bring closure to my favorite band of all time, PINK FLOYD.    P.S., somewhere out there is a nice DVD recording of a Roger Waters concert from Cork, Ireland (2006), which features Nick Mason. If you see both of these concerts, you will be a very satisfied Pink Floyd fan. :o)    One Love. Rick Wright R.I.P.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|This is the best CD ever! John Mayer is a really awesome singer, but this CD really got me!
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I wasn't sure what I'd get with this album, but I did like Katy Perry's \\"One of the Boys.\\"  Several songs are fun and catchy. I liked it :)
B000050IL0|5.0|Let me begin by saying that the Goldberg Variations are somewhat of an acquired taste.  Very few appreciate the Variations on the first listen...    Glenn Gould's 1981 interpretation is divine.  The overwhelming technical prowess of his 1955 rendition has been superseded by this emotional and mature interpretation - what can only be attributed to the passage of years...    I listen to this every night at bedtime.  It's simply beautiful.
B00006FDCD|3.0|The DVD of Stephen King's It is a big disappointment. This is one of the best books that I have ever read and was eagerly awaiting this adaptation. It doesn't portray the unbridled fear that the book does and the acting is average. I give this 3 stars, but the book is easily 5 stars!
B000PY52EU|3.0|This is a strange yet rewarding film. Samuel L. Jackson and the actor who plays R.L. do a very good job of making a semi-ridiculous film seem semi-believable. I believe that Christina's character being tied up in chains by a black man is meant to represent one of the strongest fears that white men had about black men down south; that they were more masculine, overtly sexual and were out to steal and rape \\"their\\" women. Of course, Jackson's character, Lazarus, does no such thing. Instead, he takes care of Rae, Ricci's character, and helps cure her of her disease. For those who know nothing about the Blues, this film can be a little misleading. For instance, Blind Lemon Jefferson's recording of \\"Black Snake Moan\\" has nothing in common with the version Jackson performs, save the lyrics. The original is much more convincing, musically complex, and features superior vocals. There is also a very strong emphasis on Hill Country Blues in this film, as we can see by the presence of Kenny Brown and Burnside's grandson, who is an excellent drummer. Hill Country Blues is not the form of Blues that is usually thought of when one hears the word \\"Blues\\". Instead, the Delta Blues of Muddy Waters or Son House is often pictured. Hill Country Blues was not even known about until Lomax went down south and discovered the magnificent \\"Mississippi\\" Fred McDowell. R.L. Burnside, who was a McDowell disciple, has his music prominently featured in this film, though he is not historically important at all. Even at his best, he is a second-rate Fred McDowell. If those who worked on this movie knew more about the Blues, they would have taken out a lot of the Junior Kimbrough and R.L. Burnside music and included songs more representative of the Blues as a whole.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|My favorite character is the villian (Yusaku Matsuda).  His life story is very interesting.  He did a great job in this film.  It doesn't hurt that he is very attractive. A real bad boy!
1401300529|5.0|I have read numerous books on the Korean War including Martin Russ's \\"The Last Parallel\\" and \\" Breakout:The Chosin Reservior Campaign,Korea 1950 which I found to be excellent. David Halberstam has written I think the very best book of all the books I've read on this subject. The research on the politics,President Truman (the happenstance President), General MacArthur (the megalomaniac) and all of the other Generals who did his bidding (the Bataan \\"gang\\")is the tip of the spear. You will not find a more knowledgeable,interesting book to the point of not being able to put it down. To say I've enjoyed reading \\"The Coldest Winter\\" wouldn't be true.....I didn't want it to end.
0452289963|4.0|As part of a Scripture study group, we decided to stretch in choosing this book.  It is scriptural by reference as opposed to total content.  In a group of twelve, two to three were put off itially because it didn't have the structure we had been used to, four to five have 'jumped in with both feet' and the remaining are gradually open to participating.  I have a deep and cherished foundation and practice in my faith. As humans, we all have a foundation spiritality before alligning ourselves with organized religion and the discovery of this basic reality is where Tolle takes you.  I do like the work and would recommend it to you if you are willing to be open to discovering the 'who' and 'what' of what it means to becoming fully human.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I love this movie.  The combination of the storyline and the music has won me over.  My background as an adopted child makes this story close to my heart.  It also reminds someone that life is always intertwined, whether you are aware of it or not.   It inspires me to stay aware, so that someday I can see how my life has intertwined with around individuals.
0395389496|5.0|What can one say about an illustrator like Van Allsburg? The Polar Express is almost not a children's story but for the child with a vivid imagination (and may there still be a few in existence!!) they will identify with the little boy who travels in his dreams by the Polar Express. I know they have mad an animated film of this book and done it well but it really is more a nostalgia trip for adults. I have never seen a Van Allsburg done badly they are always incredible books and I would love to own the lot. Highly recommended!

B000294SFW|5.0|Thanks to Amazon.com, I got a new Motorhead CD, at a much lower price than at simular onling sites, and not to mention the on the spot timing amazon has with diliveries, when the say 3 days, it will be there in 3 days.   And Motorhead is an amazing metal band that I have enjoyed listening to for years,  The album is awesome, and its worth every pennie I spent on it, \\"In the year of the wolf\\" is my personal favorite song from the album.  It takes some real musicianship to write such a powerful song, with such intense lyrics.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I can't dock any stars for the lousy, over-distorted production, because the music is so good.  I haven't listened to Metallica regularly in a very long time.  Crucify me, but to me, this is their best album.  Something about it gripped me instantly, and I can't take it out of my stereo.  And I listen all the way through the 6+ minute songs, instead of skipping through like I would usually do.    Metallica is back, and I hope it brings back metal!    (But dear god, how could a CD be released so distorted in this day and age?  I was skeptical until I heard the comparison...seriously, something needs to be done.)
1593974744|5.0|for such a long time. I have no clue how I missed out on this classic, but the story certainly stands the test of time as one of the best science fiction stories published. I thoroughly enjoyed my introduction to the series with the 20th anniversary edition audio book, narrated by Stefan Rudnicki, and other narrators including Harlan Ellison. Having multiple narrators perform the story made this a special listening event.<br /><br />If you are new to this series or story, I would highly recommend you listen to the audio book version, as it is an exceptional story form the author has taken great effort and pride to make this presentation his best work.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Man, how anyone could not love this movie is beyond me!  It is just like the show just longer and more to LOVE!  I was crying and on teh edge of my seat to see what would happen next!  The shows focal point of the friendship between these ladies was greatly emphazied-I LOVED IT!  No one was off their game!  The only thing I truly did not like was that they cheated the fans with this WACK DVD that they put out with extras that were of no real use and does not live up to the awesomeness that is Sex adn the CITY!  For those who was disappointed I am so sorry you feel that way because this movie hit the spot!
0739368044|5.0|is a motion picture of the mind. If you have not heard the narration of the \\"Inheritance Cycle\\" series through the voice of Gerard Doyle you are missing the very best part this amazing tale. Gerard Doyle breaths life into the characters through voices he has created and his use of the ancient languages of elves and dwarves. His classically trained Shakespearean voice enables all characters to develop through the imagination of the mind. If stories are well written they are made even better when they are well told. Gerard Dolye delivers the emotion of an enraged King Galbatorix, the wisdom of the ancient dragon Gladyr, and the insecurity of a young dragon rider trying to fulfill the many obligations that face him in this latest audio book.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" captured my imagination, with \\"Eldest\\" exciting and the best of the three, and Brisingr an important bridge in the story and enjoyable in the telling. Many have commented that the book was too long, dragged on, or should have been the final book. Speaking for myself I will be sorry when the story ends with the next book, as I enjoy a good tale no matter how long the story. The great thing about listening to these audio books, is that it doesn't take much effort to get swept up in the magic and enjoy them over and over again.<br /><br />If you have not listened to an audio book before, this series is a great one to start with. The \\"Inheritance Cycle\\" are \\"unabridged\\" audiobooks which means they are read just as they were written, word for word. I highly recommend this listening experience.
0930289234|5.0|This book was amazing. It kept me guessing all the way to the end, which in my opinion was ripped-off. It has great character development and a complicated but superb storyline. Highly reccomended.
B000FSME1A|4.0|Where could I possible start with this movie. First of all i don't think my head has stopped spinning. Apocalypse Now is an odd movie to say the least and nothing like i have ever seen. It was strange, disturbing, violent, seemingly immoral, and guess what, i loved it. From the very first scene it becomes obvious this isn't your typical war movie. The farther in you go the more it plays out like a psychological horror film. Francis Ford Coppola achieves this style many different ways. Everything from Martin sheen's inner monologue, to the films striking cinematography to its intense plotting works cohesively to bring this films intensity and brilliance<br /><br />In a large sense, it is an extremely artistic film. The entire movie is immensely visual and surreal. The filmmakers used a fascinating array of colors and textures in their shots. The camera gets everything from sweeping shots of helicopters flying over the Vietnamese landscape to ominous close-ups of men covered in shadow.<br />Another striking component to the film is its foreboding soundtrack. I usually find that music play an extremely important role in the quality of the film and Apocalypse now doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The sensual aspects a film can only take you so far unless the subject matter holds your attention as well. As if the effect this film has on your senses isn't commanding enough, Apocalypse Now's effect on the mind takes it to an entirely new level. I left the film utterly confused on the moral message of the film but i think that was more or less intentional. So many of the actions of the different characters are appalling but Coppola brings you so deep into the world of the Vietnam war that it is hard condemn them.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now is an extremely representational film. I think the only way for a film to even come close to conveying the horrors of the Vietnam war is to show it with a surreal darkness. Apocalypse Now does its job phenomenally and holds your attention long after the film is over. As it turns out, Marlon Brando's famous quote encapsulates the essence of this film exquisitely.it turns out, Marlon Brando's famous quote encapsulates the essence of this film exquisitely.
6305907145|5.0|If one knows the novel, one supposes this to be a major disappointment. I will leave it to those in the know to make the final judgment of this movie as an accurate interpretation of the original. As a post-modern deconstruction, that is, as a director's version, if you will, of the original, it seems to me this can be evaluated on its own terms. Does it work? Is it entertaining? Is it enlightening? To these question, my answer is yes. I found the explicit references to the slave trade valid if not faithful to Austen. This is a 20th century artist's take on an injustice wrongly neglected. Tying the English country life to the source of its wealth strikes me as valid. Dramatically, it works as an explanation for the son's torment and for the father's guilt. Harold Pinter, by the way, is fantastic. The Nobel-winning playwright makes a rare appearance, offering a wonderful glimpse into this fine actor's talents. I found all of the performances convincing. I especially loved seeing Lindsey Duncan playing two roles, that of the wayward sister, strapped with a loser husband and a house full of crying babies and that of the aristocratic drug addict lying about the country house being waited on hand and foot.  No doubt there will be a better version one day, but this one does a fine job of drawing modern audiences to what must be the director's chief claim, which is that Austen is an exciting author worthy of multiple interpretations.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Although this is Metallica's best work in years and I love the music, someone in the mastering stage decided to crank the volume levels all the way up and the result is a CD that sounds distorted and fuzzy at any volume.

B001EOQWF8|1.0|Before I start, the low rating is for Amazon, not the film.  I LOVE THE FILM. I'm reviewing their bizarre mistake with the 2 blu-ray versions of this movie.    I'm not a digital copy fan. I think it's the same excuse as HD-DVD's combo con to make a few (usually 5) extra bucks without giving the consumer a choice. Because there's no way on God's earth it costs them 5 bucks to produce it. HD fans WANT the highest quality, not neccesarily a lower-quality version of the SMAE thing in the SAME box (which is what you got in the past with no choice, and what you get if you but the 3-disc version of this movie. There is NO new/different content).    So imagine my joy when I saw that there are 2 Blu-ray releases, one with, and one without the digital copy! Fantastic - now I can buy the one I want, which is this movie looking as good as it possibly can. If I'd wanted the convenience of portability, I'd probably just get the standard def dvd that I can play anywhere. Not both. So, fantastic. I don't have to pay a few bucks more for something I don't want!    So what do Amazon do? Discount the non-digital-copy version LESS than the other, making them the SAME PRICE! How on earth does that tell Disney or anyone what we prefer as consumers?!    So rather than get the 3-disc and have an extra bit of non-biodegradable landfill (do you see the irony there, Amazon.com?), I'll get the 2-disc version. But maybe now I won't get it from Amazon.    FInally, what ever happened to Amazon's info on extra content? Is there even one Blu-ray page that has it? Because that would be really helpful in letting people know for example that the digital copy is just the first disc again, but in standard resolution...    As for the film, four stars. Wonderful, beautiful.
0452289963|5.0|Working in a used bookstore, I'm exposed to a lot of books and ideas.  Along comes \\"A New Earth\\", and although this may be nothing new under the sun in terms of content, it really doesn't matter.  Like many writers before him, Ekhart Tolle is presenting old material in new ways.  If \\"A New Earth\\" is running with the precepts of Zen Buddhism, or other philosophies, he's done a wonderful job of putting them into this very accessible book for modern times, that is a very easy read.<br /><br />Personally, although I could probably use a good dose of Zen Buddhism, or even just plain ol' meditation, I never read any ZB, nor meditate, in that order.  Quieting my mind enough to meditate is a huge effort when my thoughts never seem to stop.  On the other hand, I CAN see myself doing a lot of the suggestions in \\"A New Earth\\" -- separating myself from my most inane, repetitive thoughts, making a \\"space\\" in my life, no matter how small.<br /><br />In this way, \\"A New Earth\\" is a kind of workbook.  You are given easy ways to get outside of yourself (ego) long enough to recognize the misery you are causing when you cause it -- to yourself, and to others.  If working through the religiously traditional path of Buddhism works better for others, I say they should go for it.  Myself, I have never hung well with established religions, Buddhism or otherwise.  I prefer other people like Ekhart to go into these world religions and philosophies, grab the core teachings, and bring them back to me for study.  Hey, if this is \\"Buddhism for Dummies\\", call me an idiot, I loved it.<br /><br />As you can see, I am trying not to take offense at the other comments made here by those who have obviously put a lot of time and effort in their philosophical educations.  This book was not for them, and why would it be?  But apparently they think it is too `fluffy' for other people as well.  Not so.<br /><br />Like any book in the genre (spiritual) this will not be everyone's cup of tea.  If it speaks to you, then it's yours.  This is mine.  And it's already starting to work.s is mine.  And it's already starting to work.

THIS IS WHERE THE TEENAGER WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR LEANING AGAINST A WALL, WHILE TWO DRUNK TEENAGERS WERE HOLDING DOWN A CAT, AFTER EVERYONE HAD MADE A BET, THAT ANOTHER TEENAGER WOULD NOT HAVE SEX WITH THE CAT.

B000LC55F2|5.0|One of our favorite movies in my home is \\"The Prestige\\". It is an incredible work of art. The movie stars Christian Bale, of \\"The Dark Knight\\" fame, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and yes, David Bowie. I watched the movie, expecting to (ho-hum), watch and do other things, but soon became lost in the story.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan did a wonderful job of creating a spooky, dark, ambiance for the story. It quickly draws you in, and keeps you hooked for the entire show.<br /><br />David Bowie is a standout, of course, as Nickola Tesla- the inventor of the \\"Tesla Coil\\", or \\"Caged Lightening.\\" He lends himself to the role, but is entirely believeable. We are fortunate enough to have a \\"Tesla Coil\\" in a local museum. It is amazing! Those of you who haven't seen one, it would really be worth you while to do so. Then you could watch \\"The Prestige\\", do research on Nickola Tesla, and watch \\"The Prestige\\" again.....Or at least- that's what I plan to do!

B001GAPC1K|5.0|The movie itself is fantastic, but the disc could use some work...  If you own a PS3 the geniuses at Paramount decided to make you download the BDLive content before you can watch the movie, causing the \\"Blue Ring of Death.\\"  So basically, it's not an error, it is a feature lol!  If you wait long enough, it will clear and you will be able to play the movie.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if their severs can handle the numbers right now (1800 hrs on the east coast with the #1 new movie = a loooong download time).  The other option is to turn off your internet connection during B-ray movies on you PS3 (check under BR options).  This will allow you to skip the download and get right to the movie (just download it later at a better time).

0375842209|5.0|You will recommend The Book Thief to all your friends, but never want to part with your own copy, because you'll want to read it again. Much of the prose is astounding. Although it may be recommended for young adults, this work is rich in creativity and depth of its characters and truly is a book for all ages. It will be a classic and it is no wonder that it has won many awards.    Zusak immediately thrusts us into the inventive character of Death as the narrator: 'Here is a small fact. You are going to die.' It is then we meet Liesel, a young German girl who has suffered the death of her younger brother, the disappearance of her mother and her placement in the Huberman foster home.  Her foster mother, Rosa, has a harsh demeanor but her foster father, Hans, her friend, Rudy Steiner, and a Jew named Max -each help her find her own way in Nazi Germany.  Leisel steals her first book at the grave of her brother and learns to read it from her foster father. Later, she steals more books from the Mayor's wife and learns the power of words, even how the words of Hitler influence a nation.     Teachers of literature should recommend this book to their students so they can learn to appreciate the genius of how words are used to captivate and enlighten.  In a brief sentence, Zusak can paint a picture, deliver an emotional punch and skillfully use language to transport the reader to another place and time. This work is a sheer joy to read!
B000ASATZ8|3.0|I've been searching for fun action movies I can watch with my 7 year old.  We've gone through all the latest ones (Harry Potters, Spiderman, ect...) and then I recalled Tremors, the orignal. I think it's a classic. I had know idea there were sequels. I was going to rent the original, but then happened upon this 'Attack Pack' and just went for it figuring even if only two movies were good it was worth it for the price. I was pleased that the first two were great, the third a bit weak, the fourth I could barely make it through. But my son enjoyed all them; and I say it's well worth the money.
B000PY52EU|5.0|I first saw this film when it aired on Showtime, never having wanted to see it before as I didn't quite get what the film was about. My first time watching it, expecting that I wouldn't like it, just the opposite happened. The film is wonderfully acted by all actors.. Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, Justin Timberlake, ect. The story to me is a sad one, with a very moving and happy ending. You feel for the characters, and I think Ricci shines in this difficult role. A movie with a more serious underlying note, definitely worth seeing. Great soundtrack too. Am glad to have a copy of this film in my collection.

B00006G8G1|5.0|Superb eighteen song DVD of the notorious Iron Maiden playing to an extremely large crowd in 2001. Fortunately, I got to see them a year before that. Semi-promising tracks off their new (at the time) disc 'Brave New World' included the title track, \\"Ghost Of The Navigator\\" and \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\". Sound and picture quality here are top notch. Of course, we also get to thoroughly soak in plenty of that good 'ol classic Maiden like \\"The Trooper\\", \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", one of my personal Maiden favorites - the awesome \\"Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" and the '80's metal foot-stomper \\"Run To The Hills\\". For me, one of the most memorable scenes on this DVD is during the song \\"Iron Maiden\\", when vocalist Bruce Dickinson bonds with several women (who are dressed to be sacrificed) groups in and willingly enters an actual iron maiden - the ancient torture device. Highly recommended.
B00180R06I|5.0|Carl Dreyer is a film-maker's film-maker.  His films resonate, and are imbued not just with striking images, mise-en-scene and editing choices, but with a numinous nexus of meaning.  I'll watch a Dreyer film, and in the course of the days and weeks to come, a moment or moments from the film: a notion, a face, a dramatic epiphany, (or all these things), will return to haunt me.  Fortunately it's not usually a spooky haunting, but an artistic one: the mastery of Dreyer as a cineaste strikes notes which always resound in this viewer's soul.<br /><br />Oddly enough, in the case of Vampyr it is a spooky haunting. Sort of. As the wonderful supplemental features in this Criterion edition of Vampyr make clear, Dreyer wanted to make a \\"popular\\" (or at least commercially successful) film after the financial disaster of The Passion of Joan of Arc.  Vampires had made at least a modest bite into the popular culture of the 1920s: Nosferatu, London After Midnight and the stage production of Dracula with Bela Lugosi all exploited the public interest in the undead.  Dreyer had his subject.<br /><br />I won't repeat the story of the production tribulations of Vampyr, where Dreyer worked both as a producer and director.  Suffice it to say that Vampyr was also a commercial flop. Dreyer had a nervous breakdown  and checked himself into the Joan of Arc Sanatarium to recover.  He didn't make another film for about another 10 years.  As for the film: the original negative for Vampyr no longer exists.  The soundtrack, especially in those early days of European sound-film making is horrible.  When I first saw this movie long ago back in college, I was entirely put off.  The sound sucked, the acting seemed stilted and the print looked<br />fuzzy, scratchy and just plain terrible.  Worse still, it just wasn't scary.<br /><br />It's still not scary.  But it's eerie, and this eeriness is worth consideration.  Criterion has cleaned up the movie's sound, and, to the best extent possible, restoredthe image.  Vampyr was a low-budget production and, though it looks antique to us, it was deliberately set in contemporary times.  Dreyer found an abandoned factory for the scene where the vampire calls an abrupt halt to the fleeting shadows dancing across the walls during a witches' ball.<br />These scenes feature startlingly modern compositions, evocative lighting and a fluidly gliding use of camera by Dreyer's gifted cinematographer Rudolph Mate.  The musical score has been cleaned up as well, and contributes much to the disconsolate mood of the piece.  I won't analyze the plot of the film, (loosely based on Sheridan Le Fanu's short novel \\"Carmilla\\") or the character relationships, whose opacity seems as much a characteristic of Dreyer's approach as of his largely non-professional cast's shortcomings as actors.  The reason why Vampyr is worth watching is because this film succeeds astonishingly in conveying the surreal, illogical yet poetically thematic experience of dreams and nightmares.  The episodes here don't link at all well in terms of narrative structure. However, the quality of light in one sequence (the boat caught in the fog) visually evokes the cascading flour in the mill sequence with which it's intercut.  The parallel cutting suggests there may be a meaning linking the two sequences, but there is no overt narrative or even character link.  We're left with the soft slow clouds of fog, the briskly tumbling suffocating clouds of flour, and the knowledge that the characters in these parallel scenes are lost.  It's a dreamlike, poetic moment, evoked beautifully by cinematic means.  Vampyr is the film poetry of unquiet dreams, and worth a visitation.  (The special features of this fine two-disk set include interesting critical analyses, a wonderful short feature about the production of Vampyr, a filmed interview with Dreyer, and--- in a supplemental booklet--- the shooting script and a reprint of Le Fanu's \\"Carmilla.\\"  Film school in a coffin-box withoutthe school!  Enough to make any self-respecting movie vampire drool!)

0143038419|5.0|I first heard about this book after seeing the author, Elizabeth Gilbert, on the Oprah Winfrey show.  I brought the book shortly thereafter and started to read it right a way.  It became too painful, however, for me to continue reading it when Elizabeth Gilbert was describing her relationship with David.  I stopped reading it and placed it my headboard.    The reason why, at that time, it was too painful for me to read Eat, Pray and Love was because the relationship I was in, which had been an on-going relationship for more than six years, was heading south and I didn't know what, if anything, I could do to prevent it from ending.  I wasn't in the proper frame of mind to read the book at that time nor was I in the proper frame of mind when the relationship *did* end, painfully so, and left me devastated and suicidal for several months.      About a month ago I picked up the book again and, this time, it was a blessing.  As I read the book, I saw myself clearly mirrored in what Elizabeth Gilbert was describing and realized that was why I found it so hard to read the last time.  Unlike Elizabeth Gilbert, I haven't found myself yet but continue to grow as I read and mediate.      There are two areas of the book which are my favorites. One is when she is in India and the other is when she is talking to the medicine man in Balise.  I found so much profound wisdom in those two sections that most of the pages are yellow instead of white. :-)     As I started to get close to the end, I found I didn't want to read it anymore.  Not because it was too painful to read; not because I wasn't getting anything out of it but just the opposite.  I didn't want to finish reading it because I didn't want the book to end.  Elizabeth Gilbert writes from the heart.  She writes with a great deal of warmth, love and with a sense of humor; most of all at herself.  You feel, as you read the book, that you have found a friend.     For those who wrote reviews and didn't like the book, maybe theyweren't in the right frame of mind when they read it.  My advice is to read it again; you just might be surprised by what you get out of it a second time around.

0143037757|5.0|This is a marvellous book, so nice and easy to read. The author's account of the end of the Soviet Era in the East Countries is very, very interesting. Also excellent are the insights of the events of the 50' and 60', of which I do not remember, since I was a kid.    This is a book that teaches you for live, and makes you think and reflect so much aboout the present.    It is a \\"must read\\" for all interested in Europe and the evolution of the Western World.
0735204314|2.0|In an attempt to make his book accessible to the masses, Dr. Murphy has taken a useful truth that contemplatives throughout history have known for centuries and diluted it and dumbed it down to the point that it looses much of its believability. For example, on page 22, he relates a story in which a man says, he would, \\"...give his right arm\\" to see his daughter healed from her arthritis and psoriasis. He then goes on to say that, \\"one day\\" the family got into an automobile accident in which the man lost his arm, but from that point on the daughter's medical problems disappeared. Oh come on! I know an urban legend when I hear one! If your going to make a wild claim like that, you need to back it up with specific documentation, something Dr. Murphy fails to do. Another example of an extraordinary claim which he fails to back up is on page 19 where he states, \\"Your subjective mind can leave your body, travel to distant lands and bring back information that is often of the most exact and truthful character.\\" A claim like that needs to be thoroughly backed up by pages of specific, documented accounts, not just thrown in to be believed without a challenge! I've studied at length the results of the CIA funded SRI study on remote viewing and I can tell you that there is no evidence whatsoever that such a thing is in any way possible! Another problem I have with the book is it's insistance on using Christian references and biblical verses as proof of the doctor's claims. While he does this in a more deistic fashion than mainstream Christianity, it still becomes an unwanted and unnecessary distraction. He also has a rather unique definition of prayer which he uses often when a more accurate word for what he proposes would be meditation or self-hypnosis. He also mentions nothing about the corresponding brainwave states - in this case alpha and theta - which relate to the proper mental state for self-healing. Finally, he looses what little credibility he has left with his useof infomercial-like \\"carny\\" sales technics. Phrases like, \\"Get the promotion you want...\\", and Miracles will happen to you, too...\\" make the book sound more like a Robert Tilton fundamentalist pep rally than a useful strategy for improving your life. If you're interested in this subject, I would recommend any of Ken Wilber's books, particularly, \\"The Simple Feeling of Being\\". Ken's books are extremely useful and don't insult your intelligence like Dr. Murphy's does.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I first saw it when I was on a student exchange in Mexico (we had a tv channel on campus on which you could watch Supernatural, Smallville, etcetera) and I was instantly hooked. It is exciting and funny at the same time.
0446579939|5.0|Here in New Zealand we were lucky to have this book released on th 26th of Septemeber before the States release date. Another perfect book from Nicholas Sparks and is exactly what you come to expect from him. It truly is amazing how he is able to in each of his books capture the audience the way he does and this book is definatley no exception. You are drawn in with this story and makes you really think if there is such a thing as fate, luck, destiny and true love. I highly recommend this to any fan of Sparks and to anyone who wishes to become a fan. You will not be disapointed.
B0019T9FL6|2.0|Love ya Jen, but this wasn't a great CD !! You have an awesome voice all its own but to add as \\"fluffy fillers\\" Ludacris, T-Pain, Fantasia, And I'm Telling You, and Jesus Promised to the mix was just wrong, dead wrong.  Spotlight, We Gon' Fight, Invisible, and Stand Up are the only standouts.      You'll sell a lot of CDs, but next time, stick to your voice alone.
0887306667|5.0|This book is for intermediate to advanced level marketers. It shows you the strategies used by big brand names like Coke, Pepsi, Toyota, AT&T, etc. It chronicles the battle of these big name brands and the brilliant moves of some, and the dumb mistakes of others.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book is when the authors talk about \\"rungs\\" within peoples minds. Did you know that, depending on the product that you are marketing, only a set number of rungs exist within peoples minds?<br /><br />Another fascinating point in this book is where they discuss how important it is to position yourself on these rungs. They ask a few questions to really drill the point home about how important the position you occupy on this ladder of rungs really is. For example, they ask you, \\"Who was the first President of the U.S.? Now who was the second?\\" Or \\"Who was the first man on the moon? Now who was the second?\\" So it had me thinking OMG they are right. They then go into how Hertz Rent A Car was on the second rung and they included this in their marketing literature by saying, \\"We're #2\\". Hertz then went on to include in their sales copy that because they were number two, they would try harder for your business. Hertz gained massive market share and was so successful with doing this that they pulled dead even with Avis. They then changed their marketing literature to say \\"We're #1\\" to try and take the #1 position and they failed miserably and their sales fell back down. The authors go on to explain why Hertz should have stayed with the #2 marketing literature. Fascinating book that talks about what the big boys do in marketing. I highly recommend this entertaining book.<br /><br />From the author of [[ASIN:1432729543 Internet Marketing-Profits That Lie Hidden In Your Website: How To Triple Your Web Sales In 25 Days]]
B00013RC8O|4.0|sure not the greatest movie in the world, but as a cult classic its a must have and worth a watch every now and then. Also a good note is the style of filmography used, an interesting movie and a great car.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|This purchase was worth the money just to have an insight on the Apollo 12 mission - and the education of Alan Bean.  The actors were so good you could believe they were the real astronauts.  Pete Conrad's character was the great wise cracking, gum chewing, no holds barred personality, with Dick Gordon and Alan Bean's personalities shining through.  Everyone remembers Apollo 11 and of course 13, but 12, that was a triumph of both the characters on the ground and in space.  Leadership and friendship are both evident in this snippet of time.
B001CD6FKS|1.0|I bought the BluRay version of Speed Racer with the digital copy, trying to be an \\"honest\\" consumer (not copying a dvd version for my non-BluRay players/computers/iPod) and to help support those companies that make it easier on consumers to not pirate.  I respect the effort that was made...<br /><br />... that is until I got my copy of the Speed Racer BR + Digital Copy.  On the front of the box it specifically states that it is compatible with iTunes/Mac.  However, after trying to load the digital copy disc onto my Mac, I read at the bottom of the instructions that it is not compatible with Mac/iTunes.  WTF!?!?<br /><br />It is truly false advertising, and totally unnecessary as other BR+Digital copy packages work with Macs/iTunes & iPods (the world's most popular mp3/video player... hello, Warner Bros!)<br /><br />If you are buying this to play on your iPod or Mac/iTunes, then STAY AWAY!  You can buy the cheaper BR version without the digital copy and use the extra money to rent the DVD and rip it using the program, handbrake.  Sorry, WB you had your chance to make extra, legitimate money.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer Hudson's cd is finally here and of course the question is was it worth the wait and hype? I can say yes for the most part. 'Jennifer Hudson' offers songs that fit this woman's voice - there are no odd selections that will leave you scratching your head or have her reaching far out of her genre. Most of the songs showcase her vocal range with her hitting notes and doing runs that will have you on your feet and applauding in the privacy of your home or car. Is it perfect? Of course not, there are a few things that make it a bit drab and predictable but the good points outweigh the weaknesses and flaws.<br /><br /> The Good: The variety of the songs is the strength of the album. There's variety BUT her voice is never 'off' or subdued. In each song or within each style, the producers and the artist both find ways to keep things interesting and fresh. Unlike many artists, you can tell Hudson actually connected with the music and lyrics, which results in some really moving songs and fun moments. Stand-out tracks for me is the Beyonc&eacute;-esque 'If This Isn't Love' which is Hudson at her best in this pop ballad. 'Pocketbook' is also a winner with Hudson bringing out her sassy-edge that makes her endearing. Other tracks that left an impression were 'We Gon' Fight,' and 'Invisible' which contain lyrics many can relate to on some level.<br /><br /> The Bad: A lot of the mid-tempo or slower songs simply blend into one another. While her voice is always on spot, these songs just seem a bit boring because they sound similar. I would have liked to have heard her experiment and take a few more chances as she does on the song 'Pocketbook' but still, these seem a bit too safe and expected or predictable. While I can understand the inclusion of her song 'All Dressed In Love' from Sex and the City: The Movie, I feel like everyone in the world has heard the Dreamgirls track 'And I'm Telling You' and would have rather seen a new track entirely or a remix of the song.<br /><br /> A little dull and unbalanced in parts but in all, it's a good debut album that doesn't seem to be getting the 'spotlight' attention I think it should be. Check it out, you probably won't be let down.ced in parts but in all, it's a good debut album that doesn't seem to be getting the 'spotlight' attention I think it should be. Check it out, you probably won't be let down.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Jennifer Hudson nailed it with this album. I've listened to the whole cd and I'm blown away. It's only maybe one bum song on here for me and that would be the one with T-Pain but everything else for me was great.     My favorite cuts  1.Can't Stop The Rain  2.Invisible  3.We Gon Fight  3.Pocketbook  4.Spotlight  5.Giving Myself  6.I'm his Only Woman   7.My Heart  8.You Pulled Me Through.    Thats almost all of the but those are my favorites. I can wait to find out what the next single is going to be off the album. I definitely see Grammy for the album. At least Best New Artist or Best Female R&B Singer.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|At last, the long awaited debut by \\"Dreamgirl\\" Jennifer Hudson arrives and for the most part, it delivers. Featuring a plethora of songwriters and producers, like lots of R&B albums, it is ballad heavy but saved by her powerful voice.<br /><br />Opening the CD is lead-off single \\"Spotlight\\", an uptempo dance number similar to Ne-Yo's \\"Closer\\". Like that hit, this was penned by Ne-Yo and produced by him and Stargate, hence the similarity.<br /><br />Timbaland provides the skeletal \\"Pocketbook\\" (featuring Ludacris providing a rather saucy rap) which finds Jennifer backed solely by harmonies, piano, and a human beat box. Different and nice. \\"What's wrong (go away)\\" features T-Pain adding his autotuned vocals to a lovely duet (I like the note they both hit at the end).<br /><br />Other standouts are \\"My heart\\" (with delicately tinkling piano in the background), the \\"You make me feel like a natural woman\\" channelling \\"I'm his only woman\\" which features Fantasia (it starts off building up to a catfight, before both ladies agree they are being played by the same guy), the lovely acoustic ballad \\"Can't stop the rain\\" (another Stargate/Ne-Yo production - a tale of heartbreak after a car crash), the power ballad \\"Invisible\\", and the Gospel organ-driven hymn \\"Jesus promised me a home over there\\".<br /><br />I have to confess, she doesn't really get to flex her vocal chops on any of the songs, except on the included \\"Dreamgirls\\" performance \\"And I'm telling you I'm not going\\". Also included is her retro soul track \\"All dressed up in love\\" from the \\"Sex & the city\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />It does take a few spins to appreciate and while not outstanding, it's a nice introduction to Ms Hudson.
031606792X|1.0|At the time, I was 12, and I had seen Twilight in book stores hundreds of times. I had never paid it any attention until one day I finally decided to read it. I had read the back cover, but it wasn't too informative, but I did gather the fact that it was typically about vampire love. So, against my better judgment, I thought \\"Well, if I've seen it this many times it MUST be good.\\"     The beginning of Stephenie Meyer's writing leaves so much to be desired. In all of her books, for the first 150-200 pages I am bored out my mind, wishing for SOMETHING exciting to happen. I remember reading Twilight and being at least a hundred pages in and not caring about any of the characters at all. If they all decided to jump off a bridge I doubt I would have batted an eyelash. But then, something that changes the entire story occurs and it finally gets interesting 'till the point where I just can't put the book down. That is, until Breaking Dawn. I remember being at page 107, and looking at the 550-600 more pages I had to read and feeling like breaking down and crying. I wanted to chuck the book out the window and just have my friends fill me in on what happened, because I was just sick of it all. I had to force myself to read what I did, and every five minutes or so I got distracted by something around me because the book just couldn't hold my attention.    In Twilight, I instantly liked Edward because of what I thought he'd be, but then later I realized I got his personality all wrong. I imagined he'd be . . . I don't know, different. Deep, meaningful, calm, cool, collected. Not some overactive stalker. (He said to her face that when she got to Forks he WATCHED her SLEEP. I mean, mega ew much?) Bella, I hardly had much of an opinion on until much later. She wasn't strong enough for me to respect, didn't have enough of a personality for me to like, and wasn't practical or smart enough for me to even comprehend. Her boyfriend was a freakin VAMPIRE, and she's totally fine with that. She wasn't terrified, or even the slightest bit nervous, which makes no sense. Think about it for a second: If your boyfriend is a VAMPIRE, would you be THAT cool about it? You wouldn't be scared at all, when a month ago the thought of a vampire existing would have you laughing at the absurdity? But here, Bella is introduced to a world of vampires and werewolves and she's pretty much chill with it all.     Um, where's the conflict? Where's the \\"OMG YOU'RE A VAMPIRE?\\" Where's the \\"Ohmygoodnesswhatonearthisgoingon?\\" panic attack? Vampires and werewolves don't just waltz into everyday life and I expected at least SOME kind of resentment or hesitation Bella would have for Edward. But oh no, that would make too much sense.    In New Moon, I had the slight hope that maybe through the course of the series Meyer would have Bella grow and develop into a strong, wonderful and mature character. Sadly, she didn't. To the very end, Bella remains a selfish, impractical, and illogical girl who for the life of me I can't stand. Jacob was the only one with a sliver of a complex personality. He had a goal and did everything in his power to achieve it, and throughout the books you saw the different faces of his personality. Everyone else's personality could just be classified with one or two descriptions.     I won't even get into Eclipse, because I can never remember what it was about.       [Spoilers]     Okay, from the beginning. What was with that wedding? The wedding was something I was actually EXCITED about. I thought \\"Oh, wow, I wonder how Alice is going to out due herself.\\" Honestly, I don't even remember what anything looked like. Weren't the colors white and blue? That's probably wrong, but then again that's Stephenie Meyer's horrible descriptions at work. Most of the time I just imagine what everything and everyone looks like for myself. I didn't even KNOW Alice had spiky hair until the third book when Bella patted her head. \\"What? Alice has spiky hair? Since when?\\" AndI didn't have a single clue as to what Jasper looked like besides that he had golden eyes and was blonde, and then after Bella becomes a vampire they mention his scars. Oh, and there's also the fact that Rosalie is gorgeous. Well, come on now, how descriptive is that? Gorgeous HOW? Like, pretty pretty model gorgeous? Or sophisticated gorgeous? Or seductress gorgeous? Meyer, come on girl, surely you can be more creative than just using vague descriptions about people.     Now, the honeymoon was nice and all, something I thought she could have skipped until I saw the purpose it held. Bella gets pregnant! Oh joy! Oh hell. She's 19, and she gets pregnant. What kind of message was Stephenie Meyer trying to send to the young audience that reads her books? At least Edward had the decency to call Carlisle and assure Bella they would get Nessie out of her. (I am going to call her Nessie, because I think Renesmee is a hideous name and Meyer should be slapped for even considering it for the girl.) But what does Bella do? She stops him. She suddenly gets an overpowering sense of maternal instincts and wants to keep her baby. Bella didn't even really like children, and before then she never had the slightest thought about wanting one. But now, she's suddenly ready to die for this thing that's sucking the life out of her. In plain text, Bella isn't the motherly type. I wouldn't trust her to take care of my dog, let alone a baby. Isn't this the same Bella who did dangerous stunts to hear a voice in her head? Isn't this the same Bella who, on a whim, thought it was fine to jump off a cliff in a rainstorm? Being pregnant doesn't magically make you a mom, or magically make you mature. It makes you utterly terrified. No matter whom you are or how old, for any woman who gets pregnant, her first instinct is to have her mom there at all times. But does Bella call Renee? Nope, she calls Rosalie. ROSALIE, PEOPLE. That makes SO much sense.     Another point about Nessie: Wasn't she just the PERFECT baby? I mean, she was disgustingly perfect. I mean, when at all did Bella ever show any true motherly characteristics? I was surprised at Meyer, because she actually does have children, and I wondered what she was thinking when she wrote about Nessie. When did Bella ever feel the horrible strain that comes with taking care of a baby? Nessie was way too perfect. There was no constant feedings every two hours, there was no changing diaper after diaper, there was no shopping for baby clothes and supplies, there was no Nessie waking up at 3 AM and crying - which was a surprise, considering the head-board destroying sex Bella and Edward have every night. You'd think it would wake her up - and there was not much of anything. The only time Nessie cried was when she wanted Bella, which I thought was just plain ridiculous. (So what, she never wanted Edward?) Now, I understand that sometimes there IS such a thing as a quiet baby. I was one myself, and I never cried unless something was wrong with me, but there is no baby that just doesn't cry at all unless it wants its mom. That just doesn't happen. (Did anyone else feel Alice's statement that Nessie had never been set down in her life laughable? When I read that, I didn't know whether to fall out my chair laughing or give myself a face-palm and chuck the book into the dirt where it belonged. Honestly, I was surprised Nessie could even walk.)        May we move on to Jacob's point of view? I thought it was going to be, like, Jacob traveling the world from Canada to Mexico to South America to Greece and such on a spiritual journey to find himself and realize that he really, really didn't need Bella. But again, I was wrong and expected too much. No, instead he hangs around Forks, determined to stay with Bella until she has her monster baby and they turn her into a vampire. Oh, but there's a solution! They can abort the baby, and then Jacob can have a baby with Bella the NORMAL way, so Bella can still have a child. Btw, this was Edward's idea. Btw, Jacob agreed.     Ew, much. Ew on so many levels.     But I guess Bella isn't THAT sick because he didn't agree. One of the smartest moves she's made this whole series.       Another thing, I hated how Bella skipped the newborn stage. I was actually excited about that, wishing, praying that Bella would turn evil and start killing off humans. Wouldn't that be so interesting?! Her, the heroine, suddenly becoming the evil villain, using her vampire powers for her evil deeds. And wouldn't it have been beautiful if the Cullens and Blacks and Volturi and whatnot had to, oh goodness, KILL her to preserve the secret and save humanity? I would have loved Meyer if anything remotely relating to that had happened. But, as I've learned, I always expect this woman to redeem herself and the whole series be worthwhile, only to be continually disappointed.          So, why did Bella skip the newborn stage? Oh right, because it was her state of mind. She didn't WANT to be one, therefore she WASN'T. Because Bella is SPESHUL, therefore she can DEFY the natural laws Meyer has set up. But since Meyer just wants all her characters to be happy, even if it means doing so in the most illogical ways, she decided to have the most sugar-coated fairytale ending I'd ever read in my life that wasn't in picture book.     So, Bella gets everything she wants, including Edward, a baby, a family, immortality and tons and tons of sex? Check. Jacob has someone, even though she's 2 months old and it makes him a pedo? Check. The Volturi are defeated without actually engaging them in battle, causing the most depressing let-down in the history of potential battle scenes ever? Check. Sugar cakes and muffins and gummy bears rain from a glittering sky and Carebears run frolicking through the meadows of innocence as the final ending? Check. Well, well, Meyer, you've outdone yourself if I do say so myself.
B001GH63IE|3.0|If you're an Enigma fan like me, you'll understand this perfectly: this album is better than \\"Voyageur\\" (Enigma's all-time low), and not quite as good as their last album \\"A Posteriori\\".  In my opinion Enigma's best individual tracks are on it's first two albums.  \\"Le Roi Est Morte...\\" and \\"Screen Behind the Mirror\\" were great albums as well.  However, since then Enigma has been in decline.  \\"Voyageur\\" was just plain awful.  With \\"A Posteriori\\" and \\"Seven Lives\\", you can almost hear Cretu groping around for that style and substance he once had.  Occasionally he locks in on it, and it's good to hear.
B001D08SK0|2.0|Most people know what is included in this box set so I won't get into details on that. The hardback book is great, the six 8x10 photos are nice, and the blue vinyl is outstanding!     So why two stars?    Both cds and the dvd are scratched beyond belief because of the horrible packaging. The record and discs are both held in the record gatefold. Opening the gatefold, the inside left side is designed like the back of the record jacket and the record is held in that side of the gatefold. On the right hand inside are three slits in the cardboard that hold the discs. The bottom half of the discs slide into the cardboard while the top half is exposed. I cringed when I saw this. Taking all three discs out as carefully as I could, all three have deep scratches on them. To get discs in this quality from a brand new $75+ set is not right. No care was taken into protecting these discs at all.     This is probably going to be a common problem so I hope Sony will give out replacement discs but you'll still have to keep them in seperate jewel cases if you want to keep them protected from damage.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Just by reading this you have shown that you have an interest in the kind of music Amon Amarth produces, and if you are in any way inspired by this type of music, you will not find a better example of all that is good about what metal has become. This stands to be a true classic 20 years from now as the greats of the past still stand tall today such as Iron Maiden's Piece of Mind, Judas Priest's Defenders of the faith, Dio's Holy Diver, Ozzy's Diary of a Madman, Metalica's Master of Puppets etc. etc. Yes its that good!! for those who are not familiar with Johan Hegg's vocal style, I recommend that you do your best to dis-associate any associations you may have to link with just about every pretender who ever tried to use this style in the past. Johan Hegg Stands alone in this category. He does the un-imaginable of conveying true heart felt emotion in a growl that I have never heard anyone even come close to. He is the best in the business hands down. The rest of the band are the epitome of what good heavy metal is supposed to be, and they have refined all that got us excited about this form of music in the first place and concentrated it into a form of crack for the musical soul and delivered it to us in the form of a Viking warrior.<br />Bang your heads my friends, it doesn't get any better than this! \m/
B00005K9LM|1.0|One of the most consistent Judas Priest albums on a musical level. Every song is very catchy and fun. Even the slow songs are slick and well-written. Side one, in particular has a catchy nonstop momentum. A major, problem, however, are the lyrics, particularly the song Eat Me Alive. Musically, the song jams and is very rocking. The words, however, appear to be written by a very spiteful, mean-spirited 10-year old.     This album made me rethink my interest in heavy metal. Sure, the music's great, but with lyrics that embarassing, is it even worth listening to?     I was recently tempted to buy the remastered CD used, but at the last minute I bought Joni Mitchell's For The Roses instead. What a great decision. The songs don't rock as much, but the melodies are intriguing and beautiful, the lyrics are infinitely more interesting and the music doesn't make me feel like I drank too much coffee.

031606792X|5.0|My niece who is thirteen told me to read the series.     Oh WOW. Amazing series.    This one is my favorite of the four.  I think these are tremendously entertaining books.  I loved the all.  You will stay up into the night to finish them.  Twilight is my second favorite.  Highly recommended and not just for young adults.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! I love the music and the CD came in the condition I expected. Thank you!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Great transaction.     This is the best UFO album ever made Period. Live in Chicago with lots of long metal leads by Schenker, brother of Rudolf of the Scorpians. This has been remastered for CD; they have changed the begining song and other small details from the original release in the early 1980's. That one was actually better but it was on cassette tape. You won't be disapointed in this once you listen to \\"Rock Bottom\\" and \\"Love to Love\\".
B001CISHU4|5.0|What a beautiful album this is.  this could very well be my new favorite AA cd.  i cant stop listening to it.  great diverse blend of old and new styles and everything in between. can listen to this album straight through without skipping over any filler tracks, and ive done just that several times a day since it arrived last week. beautiful production.  every instrument is crystal clear.  Hegg's vocals sound amazing. if you're any kind of AA fan this album shouldnt disappoint cuz it has a little of everything on it.  if you like super heavy brutal, there is \\"where is your God?\\".  if you like sing along arena songs, there is \\"Guardians of Asgaard\\"  which is sure to be a concert favorite for years to come.  if you like the classic AA sound, there is \\"Varyags of Miklagaard\\" which is my personal favorite.  if you like galloping battle songs, then \\"tattered banners and bloody flags\\" is for you.        just when the cd is over and you dont think anything could be better than this, you pop in the free DVD and get your butt kicked once again.  yes a FREE DVD.  and its not some bootleg low quality drivel that other bands might through in just to get sales.  this is a professionally done full concert. it is just over an hour long.  crystal clear footage, letterboxed for your widescreen viewing enjoyment.  5.1 surround sound.  beautiful.  features many songs from their last album \\"with oden on our side\\".  they could have easily sold this concert DVD seperate and the fans would buy it.  but no.  AA gives it to you for free.  thats what kind of band this is.    so if you are a long time AA fan,  this wont disappoint you.  if you wanna get into AA for the first time there is no reason why you shouldnt start here cuz you get a great album showcasing their style as well as the DVD which contains some of their older songs.
B0007O38XU|4.0|It's probably funny because I'm a Star Wars fanboy. I'll admit to it. Don't expect everything from this movie and you won't be disappointed. It's just simple fun, not to be too overly analyzed. Way better than those damn Scary (or Epic, or Superhero, or Not Another Teen) Movies.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am a very fussy and ardent fan of early U.S. history and am blown away by this production. Acting is phenomenal, art direction, makeup, sets, etc., all far beyond the ordinary. In short, I'm very glad I bought it.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Unfortunately I've only listened to the first two songs so far. I've got a new kid and they demand a lot of time, go figure.<br /><br />That being said, those two songs were great. Very metal!<br /><br />I've liked everything the Mighty Met has put out except for their last, St. Anger. I gotta say it was just awful. No offense to the band's hard work and all, but really really awful.<br /><br />I loved the Black Album, Load, ReLoad, and S&M. And it should go without saying I love the others (Master of Puppets is my favorite.) If nothing else it showed the versatility of a band who wasn't afraid to play around with sound. And in my opinion, they all sounded pretty damn good.<br /><br />But this album (and actually I've heard a couple more songs but not off my CD) takes you back to what Metallica truly was; thrash metal at its finest. The roots, if you will. I almost didn't buy it because of that whole napster fiasco way back. It took a long time to forgive. But after reading about their take on that action now, I took a chance.<br /><br />This re-birth does not disappoint. Far from it. It's simply awesome. It's everything I love about Metallica!<br /><br />I know there's a lot of complaints about the loudness of this album. Quite frankly, it doesn't bother me. Go listen to their first two albums. It's raw, unabashed, and loud. The way it was meant to be.<br /><br />Love it or don't but that's my opinion of this album.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Tootsie is timeless. I saw this movie when it was first released in 1985 and recently bought a copy to see if my initial respone would be duplicated. Wow, was it ever! Dustin Hoffman is priceless in this film and quite believable as a woman.

0739449664|3.0|This novel had the potential of being one of Grisham's best. The part that took away from the novel was a long and boring tour of Italy's cathedrals. But, if you don't mind taking up a lot of reading time on the tour, I thought the story was excellent. You can skip over the cathedral parts. That is what did after a while.
1580084621|5.0|I recently spent another three weeks in Thailand, my fifth in 3 years. During my travels, I ate at the Long Table Restaurant in Bangkok and was impressed by the food. I met the chef and asked for a suggestion for a good, all-purpose Thai cookbook. He immediately replied, without hesitation, this book.<br /><br />I find the book as close to perfection as I have ever seen.  The book contains the history of Thailand, and progresses into its culinary history, indigenous foods, food chemistry, and alternative names so that you can travel to any Asian market and find the foods and sauces, spices and vegetables by other names. In the time I've been back, we have made many of the recipes and they are all winners.<br /><br />If you like Thai cuisine, or need a gift for someone who does and you like simple recipes done well - buy and use this cookbook above all others.  I have about 20 other Thai cookbooks; this is a keeper!
B00021R7CG|5.0|This was a very well done movie based on actual facts that were portrayed in a fictious movie. Everyday Americans have no idea what really goes on behind the many crisis the USA finds itself into on a daily basis. Along with the life & death situations where split second decisions need to be made.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Hopefully it has become quite clear that Slipknot is not just a metal band.  They are a progressive metal band, and prior to listening to this album, one would have no idea what to expect.      All Hope Is Gone is HEAVY, but it is hardly comparable to the Self-Titled, Iowa, or Vol. 3 namely because all members of the band were involved in the writing process. Of course, Joey has some amazing drum licks, that is to be expected, but some of the guitar work is phenomenal.  I would not say this album as a whole is heavier than Iowa, but the song structure and general themes are much more mature.  Compared to Vol. 3, there are far less acoustics, and Slipknot went back to their roots.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|This production may not be accurate and in keeping with the novel but I liked it.     Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins have wonderful chemistry together and she as Anne Eliott give s a really moving performance as the heart-broken and long suffering Anne who was 'persuaded', forced,) by her controlling family and dear friend to turn away the man she loved a long time ago, beause he was not suitable for a baron's daughter.   And meeting him again after all these years, both their circumstances have changed. She knows her feelings for him hasn't changed at all and knows agony once more knowing he is ready to settle down and has chosen his bride. He is cold towards her and despite his anger at her when she broke up with him, he can't help but worry over her now.     Rupert Penry-Jones is gorgeous as the cold and aloof Wentworth. Loved the scene when he meets Lady Russell again for the first time since she separated him and Anne and is so chilling but unfailingly polite. And the little things he does against his will, shows he still as some feeling for Anne.    I didn't like the end scenes with Anne running the streets of Bath, looking for Wenthworth. Whats with that? In those days well brought up young ladies wouldn't be caught dead behaving in that manner.   But despite that and few other descrepencies, quite enjoyed this version.

Well not so old. After all, the decade that WALL STREET famously and entertainingly captured with it's Reagan-era credo that \\"greed is good\\" is still so very much with us in so many ways. And of coarse it is because that is the American way.<br /><br />This is one of Oliver Stone's best. Maybe his best. Results are so very mixed with him. As has been said countless times Michael Douglas is superb as one of cinema's all time great villains.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural is one of the most underrated shows on tv. The third season is just as good as the others. Virtually every episode is filled with the intensity and brotherly banter that Supernatural has been known for.
B0000041ZT|5.0|It's just a lovely collection of Shostakovich's Two Jazz Suites, plus his jazzy piano concerto. All sorts of music fall under the baliwick of jazz, and some of these just sound like cheap march and dance-hall music of the time and are a lot of fun, Of course, they are beautifully orchestrated by the master -- and we also get his improvisation on Tea for Two. It's all neat light listening -- a treat of sound all through. He has jitterbugged into semi-classics composing without condescension but rather with wit, bite, and glee.
031606792X|5.0|*Warning: Spoilers*  Everyone who gave this book  a bad review for things like Bella getting everything, Jake imprinting on Renesmee, Bella having a baby so young, or marrying young, the waste of a talent for vampire Bella, not being concerned with college, the book sending the wrong message to young girls, ect should step back, take a deep breath and chill.    Isn't that what we wanted anyway? for everything to work out and for Bella to be happy? Well, now she is.  And, how is that a waste of her vampire power when she protects all she holds dear with it, and without her what would they have done?  What is the problem with Bella getting married so young when we all kind of saw it coming? After all this was a true love story. Whats wrong with marrying your true love so young if it's just that, true love? Bella and Edward were never going to be with anyone else so why wait?  Stephanie already covered the whole imprinting on a child thing in a previous book stating that when they're that young its not sexual in any way. Plus she did explain why it was Renesmee in the book when Jake said, \\"Don't you see? Even then I had to be with her.\\" talking about why he wanted to be with Bella.  She also has forever for college now that she's immortal, she can go and get any degree she wants at anytime during her eternity of a life.    People need to not take everything so hard anyways. Some of you say you can't excuse everything by saying \\"It's just fantasy\\" but why not? That is what it is. None of it's real. Some of you are so mad because she doesn't make real life choices but what do you expect? She's chosing eternity, and a vampire over a werewolf, and all that goes with it which is not real life, so why should she be expected to make decisions based upon a life thats not hers.  And for those of you who are overly woried about the baby at a young age thing. First she had sex after she was married so be sure to think about that. Young girls will see that. And if you're still paranoid then go ahead and beat into them that which they hopefully already know, it's fiction and they shouldn't base they're life on something thats fantasy.  I'm 19, and still young to some who are writing reviews. I know it's just fantasy. I know it's not real and that I shouldn't just go off and decide to get married or pregnant or both. I'm still going to college because I don't have eternity. Bella does. If any young girl does just decide to get pregnant or marry young just because of what a fictional character does probably wasn't raised right. Just saying.    Stephanie created this world and we're just privileged to be a part of it. This is her story. She told it how she envisioned it. If you don't like it you didn't have to read it, and you don't have to read it again. No one will force you, I promise.    Step back.    Take a breather.     And re-examine your priorities if you're taking fiction too seriously.

I just wish they had a CD version  I  could listen to in the car.....
B0018SWA56|3.0|After finishing a very wordy classic, I was looking for a fun, light read.  This definitely fit the bill, BUT... I kept waiting and waiting for the heroin to actually be likable, and she never was.  So while the book was an easy, sometimes enjoyable, non-taxing read - I was ultimately disappointed because the lead character was so annoying.   Altogether, a bit of a let down.
0375826726|4.0|Without giving away any spoilers, I had very mixed feelings about this book, so I will start with my quirks first and then move onto the pros:<br /><br />a) whereas I understood the need for some general background info. I was not particularly interested with some of the politics that were brought to the forefront for such an extended period.<br /><br />b) I also felt as though so much of the story played up the violence, as oppossed to what it was about Alagesia that made it a world worth fighting for.<br /><br />c) beyond which Eragon seemed like such a \\"yes\\" man to the point of irritation for me, and I was further irritated to reach to the end of the book and realise I will have to wait even longer to watch him defeat Galbatorix, and have the other egg hatch to somehow play a role in perpetuating the dragon race... or the new King.<br /><br />d) The story feels incredibly one sided to me, in that we know nothing of what Galbatorix' world is like or even Murtagh's story and that of Thorn... As with all good stories, there needs to be more balance.<br /><br />Ok for the pros:<br /><br />a) Despite how it may seem, I genuinely enjoyed reading this book, as I said I finished it in 4 days<br /><br />b) Eragon has finally rid himself of most of his oaths, so hopefully we can finally get back to \\"the real meat\\" of this/his story in THE FINAL BOOK<br /><br />c) Roran has finally been relegated to a less substantial role than in the prior book Eldest.<br /><br />Though I feel a bit ambushed with the fact that I will have to wait another indeterminate period of time to find out how this all ends up.. I think it's worth the read, the book gives you some neccessary background info and has enough action to keep you turning the pages, eager to find out the fates of your favourite characters!
B00006I53S|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this lens.  Image quality with this lens is superb, bokeh is very smooth.  Auto focus is very fast and reliable, and image stabilization makes getting a clear shot easy, even with a moving target.  I'm using this lens on a Canon Rebel XSi, and it is now my primary lens.  It is far superior to the kit EF-S 18-55mm IS lens, and is a perfect intermediate lens between the kit lens and my EF 70-300mm IS USM telephoto zoom lens. If you need something with greater reach than the kit lens, but you don't want to spend more than $500, buy this lens.  You won't regret it.
B00005JL78|5.0|I must confess that some of the philosophical undertones of this movie were poignant to me. Nonetheless, I found this movie difficult to endure. The plot wasn't very suspenseful, although it was clever. Some of the major plot twists were very predictable while subtle details were handled in a creative fashion. **My personal disclaimer is that I think such notions of law enforcement are absolutely preposterous, and my stance on the issue left me too far removed from the debate to even enjoy the exploration of the possibilities. That said, I think the filmmakers employed some cute effects, and the vision of our world in the future was eye-candy.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this game for one of my grandchildren for Christmas last year after reading the good reviews about it.  She brought it up to our cabin on our vacation this summer and I also got a chance to play it. It was really fun! Since then I purchased one for my husband and I to have here, and I also got one for two more grandchildren. It is really fun for adults, but children have fun with it too. I would say kids under 8 need a little help to find where to put the pieces sometimes, but it is a great learning toy for them. It teaches some good thinking skills, and they can play it with their \\"own rules\\" with each other and have lots of fun too! If there are less than 4 people playing we play with two colors each, or in the case of three players we take turns playing the 4th color because you really need all the colors in play to make it work well. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone! Make sure you emphasize keeping good track of all the pieces so none get lost!
B00003CXSM|2.0|This movie was not good. Not good at all. I even watched this movie a couple of times, just to give it another chance and both times regretted it. It seemed like both characters were trying too hard to act, the lines were corny as well as alot of the scenes. I think I would have liked this movie better if they had different actors for the main characters. Jennifer Lopez is a ok actress, the only movie I have really ever liked her in was Selena. Matthew McConaughey is an overrated actor, even though I think he is quite handsome he is seriously lacking in he acting skills department.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Awesome movie.  Totally nothing what I expected, and casted very well.  Nothing vanilla or predictable about it.  Love love loooooove it.
B001BKZDB4|3.0|Before I review this movie, I would like to give a little background as to my history with High School Musical.  I had no interest, whatsoever, to see High School Musical.  The Disney channel and its movies used to be filled with magic and beauty.  Over the years, Disney has really lost its flair for the magic that once was.  My youger brother told me about High School Musical and I told him to piss off!  But then just before I had to go off to work, he pops in the dvd and makes me watch the first 15 minutes.  I was hooked!  Seeing these two kids singing for the first time, falling in love right before my eyes left me smiling all day.  I wanted to see what would happen next.  I eventually saw the entire movie and loved every minute of it.  Its message of acceptance in High School and the pressures of fitting in I thought were very relevant.  The remembrance of first loves, school spirit, friends were all a part of the High School Musical experience.  Yes, the cheesiness of the dialouge gave little chance for most of the actors to turn in mind blowing performances.  But given the material, the cast succeeded with flying colors.  The magic of Disney was back.  And the world was also aware of this because, what would follow would be one of the most inticipated sequels in Disney history, High School Musical 2.  I am not ashamed to say that I rushed to the television to watch the sequel, in all its majesty.  I am not suprised to say that the sequel was made on a grander scale but lost alot of that magic that made the first so special. Yes, it had more songs, more dancing, and more cheesiness.  The truth of the matter is that the creators of High School Musical 2 made the same mistake that most sequels make.  They thought that more is better when that is obviously not the case.  The magic of Troy and Gabriella was replaced with, \\"When are they gonna kiss?\\"  But that is not to say that High School Musical 2 doesnt have its moments. There is the idea that there is alot of pressure on teens about what to do after high school, finding the money for college.      While there are fewer songs in this movie that are good, the ones that are, rival the quality of the first High School Musical film.  Two of my personal favorites were \\"Gotta Go My Own Way\\" and \\"Bet On It\\".  Its not a great movie and its nowhere near as good as the first, but i did enjoy it for what it effort and I would reccomend it to HSM fans.  But then again, HSM fans dont need me to convince them!  Looking forward to the theatrical release of High School Musical 3!  yay!  See you in the theater!
B000C13Y2S|4.0|Pluses: Surprisingly bright! Tripod design + tilt head aids in aiming the light where you want it.    Negatives: Even though it has a keychain ring it seems a bit big to put in a pocket. Might work fine in a purse. Tripod legs seem to fold up too easy.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I haven't read the books yet, so I can't speak to the faithfulness of the show to the original author's creation. I'm planning on ordering some of them today actually. I hadn't even heard of the show until my On Demand channel started advertising it and I ordered the first episode out of curiosity. (vampire movies have always fascinated me anyway)<br />  On the negative side, the show's theme music is interesting but I found the graphics that went with it somewhat off-putting. I suppose you can say that images of death and decay coupled with footage of KKK gatherings and river Baptisms are relevant to the show's material and setting, but I just found it bizarre and a bit repulsive.  Also, I agree with another reviewer that the show does come off a tad heavy on the soft core sex scenes.  The bodies are certainly pretty enough, particularly the sexually compulsive Jason and the thoroughly entertaining Lafayette. But I could do without yet another scene of Jason banging some girl's head into a wall...or a bedboard...or a mirror.  Lastly, some of the acting on the part of the supporting cast is below par.  If I have to listen to Diane the cheesy vampiress giggle her way through another scene I may have to mute the TV until it's over.<br /><br />  As for the positives, the show got it's figurative fangs in me and won't let go. The budding relationship between Bill and Sookie is very compelling. It definitely carries the show. It's interesting that while everyone else is jumping into bed, Bill's slow seduction of the virginal Sookie is the most erotic thing happening. Ana Paquin is delightfully innocent and off beat and Stephen Moyer is excitingly intense and dangerous while still managing to be a tender, considerate southern gentleman. The musical score for their scenes is also very well crafted.<br /><br />  I know I'm supposed to like Sam, after all, he's a good guy and adores Sookie. But honestly the guy creeps me out, and that was before the wierd bedsheets scene. As for the rest of the cast, the other standout for me is Nelsan Ellis. Lafayette just makes me laugh. Humor is something else the show does well. (\\"Angelina Adopts Vampire Baby\\" is a headline that you just know would be out there in this scenario) Lafayette is larger than life and twice as sassy, and you can't help but like him despite his rather dubious sidelines. His support of his cousin, Tara, lends additional depth and compassion to his character.<br />Overall, while the show has weaknesses (and to be fair, it is only in its first season) I will definitely be watching to see how it develops.for the rest of the cast, the other standout for me is Nelsan Ellis.

0307269752|5.0|When Mikael Blomqvist arrives on remote Hedeby Island to do research for the biography of Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger and his large family, he is looking for a place where he can avoid attention.  Blomqvist, a financial journalist for Millenium magazine, is due to serve a three-month prison sentence soon for libeling a man he accused of criminal activity.  For his own reasons, he did not challenge the charge and offered no defense, preferring to get the sentence over with in the face of enormous publicity.  The temporary job he accepts on this remote island involves the search for Harriet Vanger, Henrik's niece who disappeared from the island when she was sixteen--thirty-seven years ago.<br /><br />Sometimes helping Blomqvist in his research is Lisbeth Salander, a young woman thought to have Asperger's syndrome, who is under the guardianship of the state.  Salander has suffered enormous sexual and emotional abuse and has withdrawn to the point that she trusts no one.  Marking events in her life through tattoos and body piercings, she lives as solitary a life as possible, connecting primarily through the internet where she has \\"met\\" several fellow computer hackers.  Gradually, Salander begins to respond to Blomqvist's honesty and respect for her talents as she discovers important new information about the Vanger family.<br /><br />Though the novel starts rather slowly as the characters are introduced and the genealogy of the Vanger family is explored, author Stieg Larsson succeeds in creating a sense of Sweden's social culture and atmosphere as he sets up this \\"closed room\\" mystery and creates vibrant characters to carry the action.  The reader cares about Blomqvist and Salander from the beginning, as both are vulnerable and have suffered unjustly, and as the novel develops, the author also creates sympathy for the elderly Henrik Vanger.  Larsson was the editor of an anti-racist magazine, and his unforgettable depiction of some of the other Vanger relatives, who were ardent adherents of fascist and Nazi movements, carries the ring of authenticity.<br /><br />As the novel develops, the skeletons in the Vanger family closet emerge, and a host of repulsive crimes, including murder, rape, torture, and the wanton abuse of women over many years are laid bare.  The novel becomes an utterly compelling can't-put-it-downer, as the reader \\"travels\\" with Blomqvist and Salander, sharing their frustrations and their physical danger as they investigate this decades-old disappearance.  Developed in minute detail, this rich novel is especially satisfying because it leaves no loose threads, connecting every detail to produce a blockbuster conclusion which satisfies in every way.

0345495004|4.0|Loving Frank is a very well writte book bya first time author.  She mixes fact with fiction very believably.  In the story itself, I grew a little weary of the main character;s whining about the situation that she herself had created.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Superhero movies seem to be the rage these days. With movies like Iron Man, I can see why. Not that I'm complaining. If you've read enough of my reviews lately, you'll see I'm quite a big comic book fan myself so it is great news for me. True, I'm an admitted DC fanboy but I, occasionally, get into Marvel Comics as well. Honestly, though, I've never been into Iron Man as much as I have others like Blade, The Punisher, Ghost Rider, Wolverine, Iron Fist and Doctor Strange. You can tell by my favorites there that I'm into the darker, more twisted likes of Marvel's gallery. Yet, after seeing Iron Man, I've decidedly thought about purchasing his comic on a regular basis now. The movie is about Tony Stark. A wealthy industrialist who is kidnapped to build a destructive weapon for the enemy. If things weren't bad enough, shrapnel works its way near his heart and the only thing keeping him alive is a small electromagnetic generator installed in his chest.  Instead of building the weapon for the enemy, he builds a fantastic suit of armor to escape by. After escaping, he decides to turn his life and company around much to the disappointment of Obadiah Stane(his second in command at Stark Industries). Obadiah wants complete control over Stark Industries, even if it means wiping out Tony Stark and that's when things start to get interesting. Without giving too much away, let's just say things get wayyy more interesting from that point.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Iron Man is Marvel's first movie into more 'serious' material. Not one time in the movie did I find things too unbelievable or fantastical as some of their previous movies led me to feel. Even though I actually loved The Dark Knight and know that some things in that movie could actually happen, this movie made it more believable for me.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau; the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. Extras include:Trailers(Star Trek, Indiana Jones & The Incredible Hulk), Deleted/Extended Scenes, Iron Man: Armored Adventures(which is a preview of the animated Iron Man series that will air next year on Nicktoons), I am Iron Man(which is a documantary of the making of the movie), The Invincible Iron Man(which is a featurette detailing the creation of Iron Man to his present day interpretation), Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man(which is self-explanatory), Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test, The Actor's Process(a four minute rehearsal with Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Jon Favreau),  The Onion \\"Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into a Full-Length Film(a two and a half minute parody of a news report) and Galleries(Three picture galleries which allow you to see the movie through photos).<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man is a wildly believable and fun ride.Deleted/Extended Scenes, Iron Man: Armored Adventures(which is a preview of the animated Iron Man series that will air next year on Nicktoons), I am Iron Man(which is a documantary of the making of the movie), The Invincible Iron Man(which is a featurette detailing the creation of Iron Man to his present day interpretation), Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man(which is self-explanatory), Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test, The Actor's Process(a four minute rehearsal with Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Jon Favreau),  The Onion \\"Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into a Full-Length Film(a two and a half minute parody of a news report) and Galleries(Three picture galleries which allow you to see the movie through photos).

1905236042|5.0|I really love these cards...over the last few months I have been trying to encourage my 8 yr old son to appreciate and enjoy yoga.  For the most part he's been disinterested and resistant until these cards....Last night he actually said...mommy lets do YOGA...It sorts different poses and breathing techniques onto different cards with wonderful affirmations...its amazing.  He picks and we play yoga instead of \\"DOING\\" it.  Also since my son is an animal enthusiast that aspect is more obvious with the card format.  Further more each card has step by step instructions and pictures to follow.  I am so excited to be able to share this with my son....I strongly recommend them.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Well, This is the Metallica album we have been waiting for for a very long time. There is good news AND bad news. Good news is that the songs are pretty damn good and a return to an AND JUSTICE FOR ALL meets BLACK album vibe. I could go about the tunes but ultimately the bad news creeps up.....and that is the production.   Some genius decided to make this the LOUDEST recording ever and the music suffers greatly in a wash of sonic distortion from mixing above what the industry considers acceptable. The person in charge of mastering this recording has officially wanted to be removed from the credits and wants no responsibility in what you hear on it. It is so loud that dynamics and many subtleties of the specific instruments are drowned out. It actually makes you wonder if your stereo is not functioning properly.   More great news...there are recordings from a video game called GUITAR HERO 3 that are not mixed to the point of clipping distortion. While they are not perfect, you are able to hear ALL the instruments the way they were recorded.  So........great tunes, terrible sound. Your decision to purchase...but you are warned. Maybe you will not notice OR in a lot of our cases out here...it will be distracting beyond belief. There is even talk amongst the fans on their OWN message board about sending the cd back to the band.
B001E1BNWI|5.0|I've read several reviews that claim that there is unintended audio distortion on this album. Personally, I think it's all nonsense. This is Metallica, so for anyone to claim there is unintended audio distortion seems ludicrous considering that rock must HAS distortion in its sound. This is a fantastic album, and this 5-disc vinyl edition is nothing short of amazing. The packaging is beautiful, and a must have for any die-hard Metallica fan. I've listened to this album many times and I never get tired of it. It's their best work since the Black Album, and very reminiscent of their sound from ...And Justice For All and Master of Puppets.     Although this vinyl set is expensive, I think it's worth every penny. The vinyl set also comes with a copy of the album on CD and a lithograph. Each vinyl record contains two songs, and the album artwork for each song is beautiful. Rumor is only 2000 of these exist in the entire world, so it truly is a limited edition. Get yours while you still can!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I was looking forward to this album. I like it so far. Her voice is strong, pure, and powerful. This album shows that she is more than capable of making music suited to her age. While this album shows her \\"adult\\" side, It is also filled with slammin' cuts that shows that she can deliver on tracks produced by today's hottest producers. Each song have a different story. With this album, she evokes a timeless voice for this decade. She is next to Aretha, Patti, Whitney, and Mariah. I hope she gets the success with this album.

1423101464|5.0|This is the 4th book in the Percy and the Olympians series. I have heard that there are supposed to be 5 books in the series. This book was as good as the previous ones and follows the same basic formula as those ones. I listened to this on audiobook and the audiobook was very well done!<br /><br />Percy is going to orientation at yet another new school. This time more is at stake because he was allowed into this school on a recommendation from his mother's boyfriend. As usual trouble ensues and he is attacked right off the bat by evil monster cheerleaders. So starts another fun fast-paced adventure with Percy and his buddies.<br /><br />Percy flees the scene meeting Annabeth on the way and they end up back at camp half-blood where Annabeth is finally given a quest. Her quest will take her, Tyson, Percy, and Grover through the depths of the fabled Labyrinth and through many other fantastical areas of Greek mythology. As Aphrodite promised Percy's \\"love life\\" begins to get difficult with the addition of Elizabeth Rachel Dare to the story.<br /><br />This was another great book. I continue to love how the Greek myths are woven in with everyday reality. I love the characters. I love how even Percy's everyday normal mortal life is kept track of and not forgotten about. This is just an all-in-all great book. I love this series and am very excited to see how it ends.<br /><br />Great book!<br />Karissabooks.blogspot.com

B000VKW7AK|5.0|Megadeth is one of the classic thrash metal bands, and as such they have a lot of albums, and a lot of experience. This collection has something from every part of their careers, and as such it is a must have for any avid fan.    There are plenty of goodies, from unreleased tracks to never before seen video, plus demo versions of some of their most popular songs.    At any rate, if you're as big a Megadeth fan as I am, this belongs in your collection.
0790729350|5.0|Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music was far from the straightforward Discovery Channel-type documentary that I imagined. There was none of the typical narrative, offsite interviews of resource persons, or anything post-event.    This film was made at the very heart of the festival, making the 3 or so hours of footage feel indeed like 3 days, as it spanned across all sub-plots of the event. There were closeup shots of the musical performances down to the foot-tapping, the literally dirty fingers tuning the guitars, and hands wildly beating on the bongo drums. There were casual interviews with the young organizers at work, the bewildered (some annoyed) locals, the toilet cleaner who took great pride in making the portalets \\"pleasanter\\" for the kids, and all kinds of hippies, some even offering the film crew smokage.    The film likewise captures the ironies - hundreds of thousands of stoned young people and not one violent incident, a financial disaster becoming a landmark event of the century, a film that nobody else wanted to do that saved a flailing film company, and a sense of unity in the backdrop of social unrest. And for these, it became so much more than the ultimate concert film. The rawness of it all combined with excellent editing gave the audience the surreal experience of what it would have been like to participate in those 3 days of peace, love and rock and roll. And it makes you wonder, as I did - had I lived in America in the late 60s, would I have gone to Woodstock?

B000V86OKG|5.0|Being a HUGE Dexter fan, it is so interesting to me that the 2nd season could take on such a different tone.  I am DELIGHTED.  The writing is phenomenal.  To those who have never experienced Dexter, please watch season one first.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall has so fully immersed himself into Dexter and he is 100% believable in the role.  Love the FBI guy too, but then I have always been a big Carradine fan as well.  You CANNOT go wrong with this collection.

1400082773|5.0|The man who wrote the book does not seem to be the man presented for the Presidency.  This promotes a somewhat scary situation of mind-set of the man.  It is a must read before the election.
B00008RWAX|5.0|A must read for all, especially my generation (1964) and younger. We need to ensure that what South Africa went through and the racism present in the U.S. is never allowed to return. Any racism no matter how small or seemingly insignificant needs to be stamped out. Wouldn't it be nice if someday we were all classified as \\"Human\\" and not by some other label?  Read this book and realize the struggle this man, his family, and his country went through to gain the simple freedoms we often take for granted.
B0011WMHRK|5.0|Tago Mago is one of the first three albums I think of when I think of this immortal band --- but all the recordings from 1968 - 1975 are generally considered to be the prime stuff.     I imagine that most of those who find the Malcolm Mooney period of Can to be a bit repetitive, primitive, and unpolished will probably pick this superb album as their favorite --- that's okay with me since it's a solid and logical next step to those earlier recordings. And Kenji \\"Damo\\" Suzuki, the band's new vocalist, is nearly as interesting as Malcolm Mooney in his own way.     By the way, the other two albums I think of are Monster Movie and what would come to be known as Can Delay: 1968 --- you got it --- the Malcolm Mooney stuff --- these are recordings of singular power, beauty and brutality. These are truely inspired records that are among my all time favorites and Tago Mago is right there in that mix.    Any serious collection would benefit from the addition of any or all three of these great Can albums.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|I guess they didn't get all the defective discs returned because disc one the main movie does not work on my PS3. Disc two does though so I don't know what's the issue. I have put in for a replacement.<br /><br />I gave it one star because of the issue with it not playing. the movie itself is a 5 star!!! Amazon sent a replacement and it works now.
031606792X|5.0|While Breaking Dawn is not my favorite in the series I am giving it 5 stars because I think it deserves better than what some have to say about it.  Breaking Dawn does not betray its fans and stays true to the story that Stephenie wrote from the beginning.  I admit there were parts that had me rolling my eyes and one scene that had me go ewww, but it still was a good book.  At first I was upset that book 2 was from Jacob's perspective as I continued to read I found it just as enjoyable.    I know fans love Bella and Edward, but maybe just sit back and enjoy this story for what it is.  A modern day fairytale.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Ellen Page is devastatingly funny and mesmerizing in the title role of a teenage misfit who suddenly finds herself in the unenviable state of pregnancy.  The plot of this poignant, coming-of-age comedy revolves around Juno's quest to find the right couple to adopt her unborn child.  Although Juno's eventual choice of a young well-to-do couple notably contrasts with her own lower middle-class existence, director Jason Reitman has a light touch that feels respectful and true to every one of the characters--from Juno's naive yet attentive boyfriend [Michael Cera] and her loyal best friend [Olivia Thirlby] to her careworn father and stepmother [played by J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney]and the somewhat troubled prospective young couple [Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman] hoping to adopt Juno's baby.  \\"Juno\\" is hip, alive, thought-provoking and funny in a way that is no small achievement amid the glut of sub-par movie-making these days!  Page gives the kind of imaginative performance of someone far beyond her years.  This is one movie that is not to be missed!
0790729644|5.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" is a deconstruction of the classical Western.  There are no 'good guys', only different degrees of wrong.  The killings aren't idealized.  They are the filthy business that murder always is.  Eastwood's character, Muny, is a man with a troubled past.  He was a border raider in Kansas and Missouri during the Civil War although we never learn which side he was on.  All we know is that he was brutalized and committed atrocities.  His wife, however, tried to set him straight and he makes his life as a poor and simple farmer.<br /><br />Temptation comes to him in the form of bounty money offerred for the killing of men who cut and scarred a prostitue in Little Whiskey, Wyoming.  The prostitutes couldn't get the law to arrest the culprits so they have raised money and, in so doing, they have taken the law into their own hands.  Muny, at the urging of a very young, very inexperienced wannabe gunfighter, complies.  The result is a series of brutal killings with one culprit shot to death while sitting in an outhouse.<br /><br />The local sheriff, Little Bill, is, himself, a sadistic man and exacts retribution on Muny's little gang.  Muny, all veneer of civilization now completely stripped away, exacts bloody vengeance.  It's all so very satisfying which, I'm afraid, speaks volumes about our basic human nature.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, an excellent film.  Clintwood, as director, shows that his attitudes about who we are may very well parallel those of Sam Peckinpah, as in 'Pat Garret and Billy the Kid' and 'The Wild Bunch.'<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
B000UX6TRK|3.0|I bought this DVD in New Zealand and before looking at it, I checked out the reviews on Amazon. Upon seeing all the reviews relating to sound defects, I quickly played it. My copy was reproduced evenly through both stereo speakers, but it sounded like they forgot to put any microphones around the drummer. Lionel's vocals were recorded very well, the overall sound lacked depth and bass and a rather thin trebly sound was all I got.  I don't know if this is what 5.1 surround sound is like if you only have two speakers (standard stereo), if so I would be surprised.  Lionel puts on a good show, he really gets the crowd going and age is no barrier to him performing well - all the correct notes are hit and he sounds as good now as he did in the 1970's.  I was looking forward to the well known song \\"Endless Love\\", but this was the only disappointing performance for me - he only performed half the song and he got the crowd to do all the female (Diana Ross) parts of the song - great crowd interaction, but you never got to appreciate this pretty song.  In summary, a great concert, great video and very average audio, which is a shame. I am sure Lionel would be disappointed with these comments on this modern recording.
031606792X|4.0|I was hesitant about picking up this book due to all the negative reviews that I read but I did pick it up and glad I did. Nothing happened that surprised me even with the spoilers. I am a big Edward fan (Bella not so much) and I wanted him to marry his true love. I wanted Bella to be able to experience more human things including having a baby so I was almost happy to see that occur.     I do have my issues with the book, I am 28 years old & I would have liked Bella to wait to become a vampire just because there is so much more to experience than at 19. I was fine with her getting married and having a baby at 18, why not, they LOVED each other and there was no one else for them so why not. Bella did need to mature and I would have liked to see that occur prior to her becoming a vampire but after she had her daughter and became immortal you do start to see that.     Not everyone is going to like this book as some said it was too clean and too happy but isn't that what we all wanted at the end of Twilight for those two to be together forever. I LOVED tghe first two books and Eclipse was good. For all the naysayers, Breaking Dawn was a good read, take it at face value as fiction and enjoy the ride!
0439023483|5.0|I heard of this book through Stephenie Meyers website (The Twilight Series and The Host)and she said it was amazing. I thought that if she said it was good then I should pick it up. From the first page through the final sentance I was riveted. Collins does was so many authors try to do...she hooks you from beginning to end.  Her writing is engaging and easy to read. She connects on a level that is suprising in a 'young adult' novel.   Please be aware...this book is really meant for readers 14 or older. I am 24 and found some parts of this book a little hard to read. It deals with mature themes and can be quite graphic.    Without a doubt, The Hunger Games is a gem.
B000Q66PXE|4.0|This show took my breath away and I just had to have it on DVD. A whole new world -- a world of blood and iron, of blazing sun and sinister shadow, of larger-than-life TRUE historical characters living and dying as human beings. All created and filmed in loving detail so that I felt I had really found a time warp to get back to one of my favorite historical periods. When I recommended this show to my friend, he said he didn't trust it because it ended after only two seasons -- but each season ended with a logical full stop in history so it made sense. No make-believe, no false drawing-out of the story to fill empty episodes like so many other TV series. When it's over, it's over -- except now I can enjoy it again with my DVDs. Whew! what a ride!
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This movie is a great Tim Burton film.  If you enjoy this director's work you will love this clay-mation film.  I remember watching it when I was much younger and greatly enjoyed this 2-disc set.  It is not really a kids movie, the characters are a bit dark, but hey that's Halloweentown.  There is a boogie monster, that I'm sure would frighten most young children.    Still, it's a classic in its own right.  I was extremely excited to have this re-released so I could buy it.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|Outstanding.  Playing it is like seeing the movie all over again in your head. Hearing the cast sing Abba songs and the clever changes to fit the script - make it even more enjoyable to listen to.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This album really kicks A$$! My favorite tracks on this album are This is the end of the line (track 2) and The Judas Kiss (track 8). I've been listening to Metallica since the seventh grade and I still believe that they are the greatest rock band around and definitely one of the most talented. If you enjoy loud, heavy, fast rock/metal music, buy this album.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is very poorly edited. not only do most songs ramble for 7+ minutes but almost every song has at least one misleading intro slapped on the front of it. do yourself a huge favor and crack this open in a music editor and cut at least the first 30 seconds off of each song. i'm serious. it took a year to produce this album and editing was below audible bass lines and guitar solos on the priority list.    that being said Death Magnetic is their best debut since the \\"black\\" album and with Rick Rubin and Robert Trujillo bringing fresh air into the studio i'm hopefull for the future.
B000QGEB12|5.0|A riot!    Couldn't stop laughing.    Had to watch it several times to catch all that was going on.
B000V697GG|5.0|This is some of the BEST 80's heavy metal of that decade. Doro really belts out her sexy soul. The entire record is consistant with pure heavy metal bliss. 'All We Are' is surely an anthem that makes you shout along and pump your fist in the air, and an absolute requirement in her live shows.<br />Highly Recommended!

The acting on the episodes is superb (Jensen Ackles being the real standout), the writing is excellent (most of the episodes are both horrifying yet funny at the same time) and the special effects are great.

B000096I9G|5.0|This is the best concert DvD I've ever seen, hands down.  The Cure was MADE to play live.  Let me give you some advice: get drunk on Mai-Tais and watch all three albums in a row...you won't ever forget it.

B0017JKEL8|1.0|Totally useless, because upon ordering this product it was not posted that it could not be used with my cd player.  You refused to exchange it for me and I doubt if I will use your website ever again.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Some Summer movie fans thought that this film wouldn't come close to being a blockbuster like The Dark Knight.Well let me say that The Dark Knight was a confusing mess and this time DC Comics really dropped the ball.Iron Man was very well done.It stayed true to the origin story of why Tony Stark became Iron Man somewhat.In the comics he escaped out of Vietnam as a POW,in this adaptation it was in the Middle East. But that's a good thing because this film is set in the present time and it all makes sense in our world today. It is also a commentary that a man can change his ways and make a difference in the world. Faverau really avoided the fact that Tony was an alcoholic and was a greedy prick in most cases.The director did show Tony partying alot and drinking here and there.Iron Man is a great companion film to Incredible Hulk.It is best to watch Iron Man first and then Hulk because at the end of The Hulk Tony shows up and makes a comment eluding to the Avengers.In one scene you can see Captain America's shield in Tony's workshop.Jeff Bridges is in great shape for his age and plays the ultimate villain,a backstabber! Marvel is giving DC it's money's worth and is bringing the heat.Just a side comment if I may,but late 2008 and 2009's flicks are going to be awesome. Here's the lineup so far.Punisher:War Zone,Watchmen,GIJOE,Transformers 2:Revenge Of The Fallen,Wolverine,Terminator:Salvation and Superman:Man Of Steel.Marvel and DC have been at it for years over the summer box office.And that's okay because the fans are the real winners.So when you get Iron Man make sure you pre-order Hulk.And if your'e a comics nut like I am,you should get Dark Knight just for the hell of it,just because you'll be owning Heath Ledger's last complete role on film.
6305313687|5.0|Edward Norton gives an extraordinarily brilliant (and Oscar nominated) performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead in this explosive and powerful drama about two brothers caught up in a cycle of racial hatred and violence. Told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, superbly portrayed by Edward Furlong, this is the story of a family torn apart after the loss of their firefighter father, killed whilst working in a black neighbourhood. As a result, the highly intelligent Derek (Norton), already influenced by his late father's bigotry and manipulated by cowardly fascist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) becomes the charismatic leader of a local gang of skinheads. This inevitably leads to friction within Derek's family and his imprisonment for the murder of two black youths. Whilst in prison hero-worshipping Danny (Furlong) seeks to emulate his older brother and becomes more and more involved with the white power movement and influenced by Cameron (Keach) and his mindless morons. However, with a hero's welcome being planned for Derek's release from prison, he returns to his neighbourhood a changed man and sets out to repair the damage he's done to his family and to persuade his brother not to travel the same road.  Brilliantly written by David Mc.Kenna and with top-notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred. It does not seek to sensationalise rascism or violence but neither does it duck the issues. Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence. This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama. Described by the critics as \\"magnificent\\", \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"outstanding\\" American History X genuinely is a must see movie and a must own DVD.
B0000009XP|5.0|\\"Stone Crazy\\" is one of the best records Buddy Guy has made. Unvarnished, raw, not contaminated with pop-sounding songs and superfluous guest stars, this CD was recorded when Buddy Guy was just another much admired, but little recorded bluesman.<br /><br />This record sounds like Buddy was set free. After being corseted by record companies and made to play with brakes, Buddy plays with unrivaled fury and intensity on such cuts as \\"When I Left Home,\\" \\"The Outskirts of Town,\\" \\"I Smell A Rat,\\" and others.<br /><br />Buddy needs to make more records like this. Any Buddy record is awesome, but this kind of Buddy record is priceless.
B0013527I4|5.0|There's not much to complain about when you're talking about the muppets. I've purchased all three seasons for my girlfriend, and she's pleased as punch! Season 2 and 3 even had the \\"fuzzy\\" velvet covers.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|I love this star trek series, but the package it came in was badly made and the bright green plastic case had a broken piece. I wish they could have made this package as well as they did for the DS9 series.

B00003CX95|5.0|Hopefully, the furor over THE PASSION will not obscure this, Gibson's masterful account of the life and death of Scottish patriot William Wallace. Short on facts but long on legend, BRAVEHEART is an epic in the grand style of David Lean, possibly the best character biodrama since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.     This Academy-Award winning film, Gibson's directorial debut, is lavish, colorful, and long. Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is mythic, but threaded with a fine appreciation of the human frailties of Wallace, who led his countrymen in a protracted War of Independence against English rule in the early 1300s.     Gibson's Wallace is balanced, a leader amongst men who accepts his role and the attendant lionizing that accompanies it, with bemusement and wit. The character of Wallace is nearly the perfect man, being forceful, ruthless, civilized, passionate, crafty, educated, and sensitive as the occasion demands. His slow downfall in the second half of the film (and his horrible death) are envisioned not as failures in the man but as born of a need to believe, even in the face of the treachery and self-interest of others.     The Scottish nobles are drawn as amoral and torn between alliance with England and a fractious independence (as they historically were). Although they fail Wallace miserably, he is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he returns time and again to them to bolster his military and political clout. The vicious betrayal of Robert The Bruce (and his ultimate redemption) is a plot within a plot, and is played beautifully by Angus McFadyen.     Gibson's vision of the battle scenes, drawn as they are with hundreds of extras, screaming horses, and gore enough for a teenage \\"slaughter\\" movie, are singularly exciting and propel the film forward at a literal gallop. The bloody-handed Wallace is a vision in violence and determination, and ultimate passion.     Fine performances are supplied by Patrick MacGoohan as King Edward \\"Longshanks\\" Plantagenet, Sophie Marceau as the Princess of Wales/French King's daughter, and by Catherine McCormack, who plays Wallace's wife Murron. Murron, and her memory, animate Wallace, and therefore, animate the film. McCormack is angelic and sensual by turns as need demands and carries this brief but crucial role with grace.     BRAVEHEART is creatively fictionalized history and fine inspiration. It is a story in which, as Wallace says: \\"Every man dies...not every man really lives.\\"
B000006TRV|3.0|After basically ignoring THE WALL for years once I decided that I had no patience with Roger Waters' whining all the way to the bank, I've come to the conclusion that the listener does not have to buy in to Waters' monomaniacal view of his lot in life to be bowled over by the songs and how they're presented. \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" and \\"Hey You\\" still sound great after all these years, and kudos to David Gilmour, Nick Mason and the late Richard Wright--as well as Waters himself-- for giving them musical heft. Sonically, the album is magnificent. So, a great package, but as far as concept albums about how lousy it is to be a rock star go, I'll take WISH YOU WERE HERE over this any day. Or, for that matter, Syd Barrett's THE MADCAP LAUGHS.
055357342X|5.0|This is the best of series so far.  I'm excited to get started on a feast for crows.
0446677450|5.0|I had heard of this book before, but \\"assumed\\" it was a book on working hard, saving and being financially responsible, blah, blah. I was so wrong and so pleasantly surprised that it was nothing like that! It was much better than I thought and I'm so glad to have read it! I discovered I'm a mix of rich dad and poor dad, but definitely now have a better idea of what it takes to become a rich dad and have already started down this path. Having two teens to share this with over time is going to be fun and rewarding too. I've already offered my son (19) $3k if he researches and opens a stock trading account. That's when he said \\"yeah, I'd like that. Did I tell you I finished 3rd in my HS class in the stock trading contest last year?\\" And my daughter is doing the same stock trading contest this year in her HS class and she told me on Sunday that she's \\"short\\" a stock considering the market. Wow!! This book is just the spark that I needed to confirm what I need to continue doing working toward being a rich dad and also how to encourage and support my kids in their efforts. I just bought the next book...cash flow quadrants...can't wait to dig in!!
B0000042MY|4.0|An interesting proposition this. Two different composers were at work here. Tracks one through to nine were composed by Trevor Jones. Tracks ten through to fifteen were by Randy Edelman. Quite why this arrangement was adopted I don't know but the feel of the album, which is so important with a soundtrack, is intact. Which speaks volumes for collaborative album construction.<br /><br />The music here has to, and succeeds in, encompassing a number of moods. Much of the music needs to be stirring and there are no better examples around of stirring music than track three, The Kiss, or tracks five and six, Fort Battle and Promontory respectively. Other parts of the film score required a mood of tense expectation such as track ten, The courier. Still other parts needed to be gentler in their aspect and this achieved too. And therein lies the real beauty of this soundtrack. It can be listened to by people who have not seen the film and yet if you have seen it then your appreciation with be much increased.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, the thing was done in 1992 so you aren't exactly looking at some creaky thing from the 1930's! And as it was recorded before audio compression became the norm the album does breathe somewhat and that's a welcome relief. There is a short track by Clannad, who seem to be on an inordinate number of soundtracks and it's a fitting piece of music. As for the booklet, it's functional but there are no liner notes nor insights of any significance on offer.<br /><br />A hearty four stars for this lively soundtrack whose moods match that of the film perfectly.
B001GAH9YI|5.0|\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" remains possibly the most watchable of the silent films, even to those who are not silent film aficionados. Werner Krauss's use of a landscape of obtuse angles and hand-painted shadows creates a dream-like/nightmare-like reality that is heightened by the distance and the crackling of the ancient cameras. The characters, the enigmatic Dr. Caligari and his sinister somnambulist Cesare, are both creatures of dark corners of the imagination, and could happily hold court with Count Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera and other famous monsters of filmland.     The storyline is equally gripping, with plot twists and turns to rival any modern film. The innate fear of the carnival is played for all of its creepy value, as the strangers who inhabit this strange world must by their very nature carry some dark secret. It truly is a masterpiece of any age.
B000KRNG5E|4.0|Beautifully shot but poorly scripted second installment in Dario's tale of the three sisters with Goblinesque soundtrack by Keith Emerson.A journey into a surreal Hitchcockian, dreamscape of labyrinthian architecture, corridors, rooms, cellars, staircases, secret passages, dungeons, submerged rooms and alchemical mysteries, all flavoured with Dario's atypical gruesome murder scenes.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I am so intrigued with this year's Mad Men series that I had to see last year's as well. The series is totally intriguing and ingenious; it's tip top.     Back in the 1960s, I was in my 20s and also in the workforce. My experience was very different from the secretaries on the show, as I started out as a young college professor and was always treated with lots of respect by male colleagues. However, a dear friend from that era and I have discussed the series together. She was in the secretarial field, part of the office staff, and experienced all the indignities suffered by the women on the show. The recounting of her experiences allowed me to understand what those women who show up crying in the ladies room are crying about - sexual advances from some male colleague.    The lives of the housewives depicted in the series are fascinating also. They lead me to vividly recall my own mother's life. And, of course, we all smoked! John Hamm's character, Don, is wonderfully mysterious.     I truly cannot recommend this series more. It is one of the absolutely best that I have ever seen. Enjoy!!     And ladies, we have indeed come a long way! I hope young women watch the show and gain a VIVID, TRUE UNDERSTANDING of how things were not long ago at all. This is truly the way it was.    Carole
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is a review of the double DVD/CD version which is the only way to go. If you can't get it here look elsewhere! So here we go...<br /><br />Ground rules stipulate that one cannot grant more than five stars to any release. But if you could, this would be my pick for a sixth star. A release of such quality and attention to detail that it's inspiring and truly sets the bar for any other band of this genre. Musically spot on, a real nirvana for Kamelot fans, the real oommmpphh in this release is due to its' expansive nature, the bonus features and the obvious care that's gone into making the gig enclosed a showcase event.<br /><br />Starting with the CD's first. They are a straight rendition of the show. With the band spot on target and nailing every song and Khan - who as a vocalist has grown in stature in terms of his ability to emote over the years - the audio component here would be a valid enough release on its' own. Nicely produced with everyone getting their allotted time in the sun, if your a Kamelot acolyte then you'd probably find this quite a worthy addition to your collection. However on it's own it wouldn't be five stars as lets face it, live albums are an acquired taste and not everyone sees their reason to exist.<br /><br />Onto the DVD, we have the show itself which is well paced and quite melodramatic as you'd expect. Your either on board or your not in regards to this brand of hard rock shenanigans but for me I find it quite a pleasantly played and well captured gig. One complaint I have is the fact that the stage area itself is so dark and the band have insisted on all wearing black, which means that you don't see them as clearly as you may like and it's frustrating when you want a more in your face experience. The addition of a range of guest stars adds to the fun. Sascha Paeth turns up, much as he did on Shamans RituAlive release, as do a range of others - Mari Youngblood, Elisabeth Kjaernes, Snowy Shaw (standing in for Shagrath in the role of Mephisto), Christian Kjaernes and Marianne Follestad. However perhaps the most notable special guest is Simone Simons of Epica who seems to have fun during The Haunting. The audio angle of things is good as per the CD part of the release.<br /><br />The extras to the DVD however really give this release an edge. Everything from interviews that drift between the usual silly questions through to more serious aspects of touring are covered. Interviews with Simone Simons and `at home' segments also introduce you to aspects of the bands mind set and Casey Grillo takes the viewer on a brief journey to ddrum and there is a range of background information in a special feature hosted by Khan. Moreover there are a number of videos on here, the video clips to The Haunting, March of Mephisto (standard and uncensored) and the couple of video clips put together to support this release as well as another version of March of Mephisto shot at Sweden Rock 2006 AND a behind the scenes look at the making of The Haunting clip. Phew!<br /><br />One top of all that the booklet is well laid out, you get a bunch of photos and comprehensive credits to all the parts of the release and a small (A4 size) poster as well.<br /><br />Now if that's not enough for any Kamelot fan to splash out with his hard earned cash I don't know what is. A veritable feast of stuff and any band who puts this much attention into a product deserves to be rewarded with some decent sales figures. Dig in.rnes and Marianne Follestad.

B000002UB6|5.0|I'm not sure why so many people consider this to be The Beatles' one sub-par album. Can I point out how great the songs \\"Across The Universe,\\" \\"Get Back,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" \\"Dig A Pony,\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" are? \\"I Me Mine\\" is probably my favorite of Harrison's songs, melodic and angst-y and full of meaning. \\"Across The Universe\\" is one of Lennon's best (I think \\"A Day In The Life\\" is the only one I like better). Also, \\"Two Of Us\\" is pretty good, and \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" is a major hit (though not one of my favorites).     So I'm not understanding where this album fails. Like every Beatles album, this album has more than it's share of greatness and winning songs.
0452289963|2.0|I had a hard time getting into this book and finally had to put it to the side as I just couldn't finish reading it.  It was one of those books I just couldn't connect with.
1596434252|4.0|An interesting book that you could view with a child, but supervise them - the pop-ups are on the delicate side, and could be damaged easily by a child.  There are only three colors - black (and shades of gray), red, and white.  Some of the pop-ups, like the letter \\"U\\" are really fun.  At first I thought my copy was missing the letters \\"Q\\" and \\"R,\\" but I was mistaken - this is a clever book, even for those of us who know the alphabet!
159562015X|5.0|Really an excellent improvement in the test compared to the original Strengthfinders test.  The new test takes a combination of your factors to determine how each factor applies to you.  I recently had my team go through the new strengthfinders and even people with the same strengths had different descriptions about how they were impacted and the types of ways the various strengths show themselves for each individual.  The book itself is not as impactful as Now Determine Your Strengths, but the test is the primary value, so I'd recommend Strengthsfinder 2.0.  I also highly recommend Marcus Buckingham's Go Play to Your Strengths.
B001DU8T6I|2.0|This cd is'nt what its cracked up to be.<br />i thought this cd would be as amazing as the Jonas Brothers newest album, since Demi has written most of her songs with them. Demi kept saying her songs \\"are more rock\\" than what most people think. umm, NONE OF THE NEW SONGS ARE ROCK SONGS!<br />honestly, i thought only 2 songs on the whole album were good enough to play on the radio<br />her Camp Rock songs are better, and she didnt even write them.<br />im very disappointed. this IS her first album, so hopefully her next will be better.
0375826726|4.0|When one is reading this book that someone should keep in mind that it IS the half of a whole book.  I say this in reference to those who say that this book has no plot.  I mean, if one would to only read the beginning half of Eragon or Eldest that beginning half wouldn't seem to have much of a plot now would it?<br />Although, I will agree with certain people that there are moments that really seem to drag, as though it could have been easily trimmed down.  But, we have to keep in mind that that is what the author wanted to do.  It is really his book and not ours.  We can make all the comments we want but when it comes down to it we really don't have much say so in the making progress.<br />And, even though it drags at moments and is over 700 pages, I found it to be rather short.<br />Can't wait for the final.
0930289234|5.0|Great story, well written, and something someone who is not into graphic novels can enjoy(this is the first one i've read). I highly recommend it and if the movie is anything like the novel it will be nothing short of phenominal.......
0307269752|5.0|After having read this book in danish this spring I had a hard time believing my eyes when I saw the titel that the american publisher had choosen for this book. \\"The girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" does not do this book justice especially since that is such a small part of the book. I guess the orginal titel was too controversial to use in the US which would have been translated to something like this \\"Men who hates women\\" - now that is a more acurate titel and decribes the book's subject matter very well... and I think most of you who have read this book will agree.
B000001ELP|5.0|Music From The Elder is a bold and courageous album in a time when Kiss still took chances and was full of new ideas. I mean, after Unmasked, this was really one of the most radical left turns in music history. Paul, Gene and producer Bob Ezrin must have their reasons to say it didn't work but I'm pretty sure they love it secretly.<br /><br />But how can this album be so criticized by most fans? How come? Then I guess they never heard one of Ace's best solos on Dark Light nor the beauty of A World Without Heroes nor Under The Rose's big chorus nor Mr. Blackwell's great riff... It's all in there!<br /><br />I will always consider The Elder as a one-of-a-kind album in the Kiss catalogue - one that, regardless of what anybody may say, remains very alive in the hearts of those it touched!
B0000X61VE|4.0|Newly obsessed with losing weight and toning my body, I bought this DVD off the recommendation of an aquaintance who had good results.  This video will make you notice muscles in places you didnt know existed!  The DVD does tend to run fast, but I still took it at my own pace and slowed down when I felt it appropriate.  The switches in scenes make the video interesting, but Id love to see a whole video taped on the beach, as I felt the pace was more appropriate.  Would definately recommend but with lots of emphasis on stretching well before and after the programs.
B000005IS1|5.0|I was there in 1968 at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, with several of my hippie friends, when the MC5 recorded this album and it was fantastic. The energy that was generated, by the MC5, at the Grande that evening was wild and everyone was on their feet rocking. The first album release had the words Kick out the jams M..F..rs on it and the album was quickly pulled off the shelves and rereleased with the M..F..rs changed to Brothers and Sisters, if you have the first vinyl you are fortunate. Listening to this album takes me right back to the Grande and the memories come flowing back. This album is history in the music world and a must have.

B000001DYD|5.0|PJ Harvey's most compelling and classic album ever.  Every song is a work of art including the obsessive \\"Rid Of Me\\", the male dominance of \\"50 Foot Queenie\\" and \\"Man Size\\" to the comeuppance of \\"Dry.\\"  My only frustration is with Steve Albini's production style which always seems the same with his quiet then loud approach.  Sometimes it feels like he is squelching some of the power that the songs contain.  Still, PJ always manages to never let you down with her rawness.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|After a series of lackluster releases dating back to \\"Load\\", this album hits the listener with a heavy-metal kick in nuts.  The musicianship and songwriting on \\"Death Magnetic\\" are the bands best and most progressive since \\"...And Justice for All\\" including a brand new onslaught of face-melting Kirk Hammett guitar solos.  Hammett's solos whiz by the listener's ears with such intensity it's enough to induce a speed-metal orgasm all over someone's face (try playing that stuff in Guitar Hero 3).  My personal favorite track is \\"All Nightmare Long\\" which has a near perfect blend of thrash intensity and sheer listenability.    \\"Death Magnetic\\" is the kind of album that makes grown men run for shelter and causes little girls cry for their mommies.  It signals a culmination of everything great Metallica has ever done, aided by Rick Rubin sitting in the producer's chair who proves - as he has done so many times before - that he can do no wrong (Seriously, I doubt any of you can name a bad album produced by that man).  If you still are or ever were a Metallica fan, buy this album.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Long before anyone heard of \\"The Sopranos\\",there was the ultimate epic flick that changed everything in the history of crime dramas and also remains one of the top ten films of all time,and still holds the title today which spawn two sequels and was the film of the decade. This was the apex of what American cimema was and still is today.  \\"The Godfather\\" was perhaps the best three hours you can spend sitting very still and for a good reason. This was one of the top ten films of 1972 and it was a huge success at the boxoffice. This was \\"the ultimate gangster film\\",and a \\"cultural phenomenon\\" that still holds true. This was an \\"absolutely flawless\\",an \\"American epic\\" based on the best selling novel by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppula. It recounts the \\"operatic\\" lives of the Corleone family via through its \\"intricate\\" plot,bravura \\"photography\\" from cimematopgrapher Gordon Willis and \\"iconic performances\\" from actors Marlon Brando,Al Pacino Diane Keaton,Robert Duvall,James Caan,John Cazale,and Sterling Hayden. This was the film that depicted the cold side of the mafia life and it was never shown before and it also gave Brando an Oscar in 1972 for Best Actor and it also won Best Picture honors for that same year.  In fact,the end result is so \\"killer\\" that \\"nothing comes even close-except the sequel that followed it which basically picks up where the first part of \\"The Godfather\\" left off.  \\"The Godfather:Part Two\\"-picks up where the first installment of Mario Puzo's epic novel left off. It was a \\"real rarity-a sequel as good as the original\\"-this \\"true masterpiece\\" stands on its own laurels as it delves deeper into the Corleone family saga from the early life of a younger Vito Corleone played by Robert De Niro in a breathtaking performance that is not to be missed,to the family's transactions within the organization. It is a moody meditation on the emptiness of power,it's complex plot through its masterfully intercuts that gives us two stories separatedby a half-century into a taut heartbreaking tale of innocence lost and though never overshadowing its bigger brother which in turn doesn't go overboard within the boundaries of the book. But it is even more subtle and sublime with some chilling moments between the relationship between Michael and his cousin Fredo. A supporting brilliant cast with includes Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale it won six Oscars including Best Picture of 1974 and also directing honors for Francis Ford Coppula. At over three and a half hours it is grand Hollywood entertainment that is worthy of the title.
B00007LTIA|5.0|This album is like no other of Yes's albums. Even though they have great albums like \\"Close to the edge\\", \\"Relayer\\" or \\"Drama\\", this one is magnificent and delicious. Only four tracks in a double CD album seems like a boring record. It is not. You must listen to it, and I mean \\"listen\\", to capture the notes and let'em guide you to the world of finest progressive rock. Unforgettable.
1595141715|1.0|This is my first review on Amazon, and I am only doing this because I feel it is necessary to warn people about this book.    The character that is giving the thirteen reasons for committing suicide is not looking for help, and at every opportunity, pushes those away that are interested in trying.  She feels the world revolves around her, and looks for reasons for suicide because other people don't feel the same way.    Half of all high-school girls will go through most of what Hannah went through.  It is sad, but that is teenage school life.    As the book continues on, it becomes harder and harder to feel sorry for Hannah.  She is guilty of the same lack of effort she chastised everyone on her list for.    At the end of the book, the only people you feel sorry for are those Hannah calls out (with 2 exceptions), as they now have to live with the idea that because they did not put Hannah before them in all things they were the cause of her death.    This book sends a horrible message, and will be extremely confusing to teens that are facing real problems with depression, as they see a girl that has plenty of reasons, none of which are anywhere near as bad as theirs, and lose all hope for themselves if someone with so few real problems wasn't able to find a way to get through it.      The writing is great and the premise had such incredible potential, but was wasted when Hannah was written as the whiny girl looking for excuses.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|Mad Men begins with such promise - interesting characters, good writing, colorful costumes, great setting -- and it maintains that quality through 2/3 of the first season, but then it begins to turn into a fairly routine soap opera, with some predictible twists ands turns.  I would recommend the series, but the high hopes I had based on the uniqueness of the early episodes remained were deflated by the end of the season.

I Hear Black (Sabbath) all over this one and it's a good thing. They took a chance, pissed some people off and rewarded the rest of us. Then they were unceremoniously dropped by Atlantic. So goes the thrash legends of old.<br /><br />Tell your one track minded Metallica amigos that Overkill have kept the thrash banner flying and to take a chance and check out what real millenial thrash is like (and Testament too...)

If your child likes the series or the movie, this is a great addition!

0307269752|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. It intrigued me that it was a bestseller in Europe and that the story was set in Sweden. So I had to take the chance and overall I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This novel is approximately 465 pages long. I thought the beginning was a little slow. The author had to establish each main character. I had a hard time in the beginning of understanding how all of the characters would come together, including the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo (Lisbeth Salander).<br /><br />There are 2 plots in this book that are tied together. The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is a co-owner of a magazine and respected journalist. Unfortunately, he made the mistake of publishing unfounded information on a rival company's owner - Wennerstrom (and also an owner of many busineses in Sweden). Blomkvist was tried for libel and sentenced to 3 months in prison.  Blomkvists' personal life is a bit sketchy.  He has on and off again relations with his best friend and co-owner of the magazine. She in turn is married but her husband doesn't care about their 20-year affair.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a young woman who unfortunately had the short end of the stick when it came to her childhood. She became the ward of the state and was appointed guardians over her assets and her life. The state deemed her to be mentally unstabled and unfit for unsupervised living (in the sense of not having to report to anyone). Eventually, her favorite guardian takes ill and a new one is appointed - a sadistic and cruel man. She is a highly respected investigator for a security firm.<br /><br />Blomkvist has to leave the magazine to save its reputation (albeit temporarily). He is offered a job by Henrik Vanger - one of the most famous corporate families in Sweden. The job is to figure out what happened to Harriet Vanger who disappeared in the 60s.  If Blomkvist solves the case of Harriet, Henrik will give him the info he needs to get back at Wennerstrom - the publisher he defamed. Salander joins him in his investigation.<br /><br />So here are 2 major plots - Blomkvist trying to save his magazine after his libelous debacle and also getting back at Wennerstrom (the publishing arch enemy); and the plot to investigate and solve Harriet's disappearance.<br /><br />I don't want to delve into any more specifics of the book so it isn't \\"spoiled\\". However, I must say it is interesting and yet intriguing how all the characters come together. I was surprised by the solution to Harriet's mystery and the investigation leading up to that point.  I coudln't put the book down at this point. After this mystery was solved, Blomkvist then worked on getting back at Wennerstrom and redeeming himself as a respected journalist. Both plots were wrapped up tightly.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that this is a dark novel. There are  depictions of sadism, incest, cruelty, torture, rape, etc. If this would make you uncomfortable, I would suggest not reading this book.<br /><br />Here are my disappointments with the novel (not that significant): Blomkvist needed to keep his zipper up - he was too loose with women in this story with no consideration for their involvement; the ending left me hanging and annoyed - I personally wanted to see a happier ending or at least a more finished ending (i guess the reader can make up their own opinion on what could have happened next)<br /><br />Overall, it was a well-written novel. I gave it only 4 stars because I think the ending could have been wrapped up a little better and I thought the beginning was a little slow.nvestigation.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|I started listening to Shinedown by accident when they released their first CD (Leave A Whisper)and became a huge fan.  Although I was kind of let down by their sophomore release (Us and Them), it was still decent.  When they finally released their first single (Devour) for their Sound of Madness CD, I thought it was pretty good, but not outstanding.  After getting their new CD, I can't stop listening to it.  It just keeps getting better for me each time I hear it.  My teenage daughter liked their sound, but now that she has heard Sound of Madness, she is hooked.  Probably the best song for me is the title song, Sound of Madness, it has a great bass beat that sounds excellent as your cruising down the road.  Now if I could only get the local radio station to play more of the new CD.

0743277465|4.0|The author was the subject of the book/movie Searching for Booby Fisher. Not only is he a National Chess champion, he is also a martial arts champion.  He has a very good read on what it takes to get to the ultimate levels of achievement in pretty well everything.  I found tremendous insight in this book, and a heightened appreciation for the dedication to detail and performance needed at these levels. I really enjoyed his discussion on \\"chunking' information and \\"carved neural pathways\\" as tools that we all use to become better and better at everything we do.  He also gives a very clear description on the  stress and recovery model used in high performance training. As ever, I appreciate an easy to read book that lays it out so clearly that even a thick headed Swede like my self can make sense of it all.  I appreciate the line, \\" You need to know what good feels like in order to achieve it again and again.\\" We call that Knowing what the grass looks like when it is cut.\\"
B00004XMV6|3.0|Elizabeth (Kim Bassinger) works at a trendy art gallery in New York City.  She meets John (Mickey Rourke), a mysterious, wealthy stranger, and they begin a torrid affair.  He's into game playing;  he likes to tell her what to do and she does it, even when it scares her.  He wants to control her in every way and she lets him...for nine and a half weeks.<br /><br />When this came out in 1986, it was considered shocking; today one can see almost this much sensuality on TV and certainly in many movies so its impact has diminished.  The steamy, dangerous, erotic night scenes contrast nicely with the cold, sterile day scenes of Elizabeth's work.  The photography is striking with costumes and sets in stark black and white and close-ups designed to heighten our sensory awareness.  Bassinger and Rourke are well-cast but I didn't care about or like either of them. Their situation seemed sad and repellent.<br /><br />The movie could certainly be titillating, but I found it upsetting and scary and sometimes even boring.
0375826726|5.0|For fantasy lovers, this is a must-read, don't bother with those who think it's too long, because it's not. I've read Eragon and Eldest at least fifteen times, and I'm still not tired of them. Brisingr finishes the trilogy, and will forever be one of my all-time favorites.
0375826726|1.0|I really wanted to love this book.  I didn't figure out this wasn't the last book until I was almost done.  I was wondering why Paolini was spending so many pages on NOTHING without getting any closer to Galbatorix.  No wonder it plodded on and on- I think Paolini (or his publisher) wanted the income from a 4th book.  Brsingr could have comprised the first 100 pages of the last book, and then (maybe) it would have been a good read.
B00104W8T6|5.0|We enjoyed the movie very much and realized also, that we really liked the music. I put the cd in when I want to get in a good mood.  It can't always be played around little ones, though, because of language in a few of the songs, which includes the f word in one song.      All in all, it is a light hearted happy cd and if you liked the movie, you will love the it like we do.  I do wish that the words were included though, because some of the songs move quickly, and we would like to be able to sing them all.

Thats also a problem for me with the dream girl track. Why put that on here? A friend of mine says shes going to have the jennifer holliday curse with no hits, which this cd represents she just may be on the way there. The stand out tracks are Im your only woman, Giving myself to you, and you pulled me through. The rest is junk.
0517223546|5.0|Sarum was simply one of the most memorable books I have ever read.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in English history.<br /><br />There were no parts of this book that I didn't enjoy.  You live and remember with the characters.  The book actually makes you feel like you are a local of Salisbury England.<br /><br />Since I read this book I have read every Rutherford book except Russka and The rebels of Ireland. I have however purchased both and plan to read them soon.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this book.  It is an outstanding work.
0385338724|5.0|I have yet to come across a Sophie Kinsella novel that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed.  They are light-hearted, sometimes silly, and fun.  Remember Me? was not an exception to this.  I read it when I was on vacation in Germany, and finished over 2 nights; I simply could not put it down.  My only complaint was that the characters were not really fleshed out much, and the reader never really got understand their personalities.  I would really like a sequel to this novel, so that I could get to know the characters a little more.  Overall, I found this book to be a quick, entertaining read, and I am looking forward to Kinsella's next novel.

B001EN71DQ|3.0|I just got done watching the prequel trilogy. Anyone who says Revenge of the Sith is the best of all the Star Wars movies, or at least the best of the prequels is sadly delusional. In fact it's downright painful. Even The Phantom Menace with all its flaws was much more entertaining with better acting, better script, and better story than Sith. But after giving all three of the films a fair an honest viewing I can most assuredly say that Attack Of The Clones is truly the best of the prequel films. Not only is it the best of these three, which would not be saying much, because then one can misconstrue it's only the best of a bad lot. No, Attack of the Clones is a damn good movie that stands on its own.
0143114085|4.0|If you like crime drama and psychological suspsense, don't miss this book. This is a magical onion kind of book--the surface is nothing like the center and there are hundreds of layers making it up. The complexity of the plot will take awhile to hit you, but when it does, you won't be able to put the book down. I literally finished the last 20 pages walking around my apartment because I was too exhausted to stay awake if I sat down but I HAD to see how things wrapped up. The premise: new mother Alice Fancourt leaves her two week old daughter for the first time for a quick outing, only to discover, when she gets home, that the baby in the crib is not hers. But she can't convince anyone else of that. Very British, very dark, very much full of surprises and very very much recommended by me!

B001CIPU3G|5.0|Unbelievable!  That is the only word that comes to mind when I hear this cd.  Trivium have combined the best of their previous cd's (Ember To Inferno, Ascendancy,and The Crusade)and have delivered BIG TIME the best elements of those three into Shogun.  Guitars solos soar in and out with harmonic unison while the drums provide a steady, pummeling beat that locks the songs into place - sometimes I cannot believe just how young these guys are yet sound so professional and seasoned. My current favorite songs are \\"Down From The Sky\\" and \\"Into The Mouth Of Hell We March\\".
B001F7MSFM|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />And for a bare-bones edition of a movie, this one is actually quite good. There's audio commentary with Del Toro, Selma Blair, Luke Goss and Jeffrey Tambor, a series of mini-documentaries, and Del Toro's guidance through both deleted scenes and the creation of the amazing Troll Market. Also stills, production information, a comic book builder, and so forth. Not half bad, and gives viewers a pleasant look into the creation of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

B000VDDWDS|4.0|Academy Award winner Russell Crowe (Gladiator) commands the seven seas in the exceptional war drama \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World\\". Set in the early 19th Century during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) and the crew of the British warship HMS Surprise embark on a mission to intercept and destroy the French privateer Acheron. After narrowly escaping their first encounter with heavy damages and casualties, Captain Aubrey continues the pursuit of his powerful adversary into the Pacific Ocean. Directed by Peter Weir (Witness & The Truman Show), \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" is an outstanding well-crafted epic movie that successfully combines great storytelling and strong human drama. The visual effects are terrific. The climatic sea battle sequence is thrilling and very entertaining. Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany deliver great performances. \\"Master and Commander\\" was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release of \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" misses its mark. The 2003 war drama is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is certainly a noticeable improvement over the DVD but unfortunately it isn't a solid choice to show off your High-Def television. With its fine clarity and thunderous bass, the DTS-HD audio is the real winner in this release. Its only extras are six deleted scenes, a pop-up trivia track and the film's theatrical trailer. If you're looking for special features, the 2-disc Collector Edition DVD is a better choice. Overall, \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\" gets a \\"B\\".

B000YABIQ6|5.0|The world of the early 1960s ad men in New York City is brought to life in this classy and fascinating series.  The acting is suburb from every player, the dialogue stays with you, and the cinematography seems like it's from a film of a bygone era.  The series focuses on the mysterious life of Don Draper, the head of creative for the fictional Stirling-Cooper ad agency.  Don's secrets unfold as this first season goes on, surprising the viewer with each new bit of information.  It's a slow burn, but dark humor and subtle nuances in the acting and dialogue make it well worth it.  This is quality television at it's best, and very deserving of it's Emmy wins! I'm completely addicted to this show and I recommend it to any fan or person who wants to catch up on the series.      The extras make the DVD set a great value.  EVERY episode has at least one set of commentaries (most TV DVD sets only have a couple of episodes with commentaries).  In addition, there are a couple of short documentaries that fans of the show will enjoy. The simpler packaging of this set is also preferable to the novelty packaging (in the shape of a big cigarette lighter) that has also been released.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|On another film I reviewed on Amazon, I said that I only follow directors and not actors. Here, I'll make two strong exceptions. But, first let me digress a moment to applaud Mr. Scott for yet another great film. There are directors who I look upon as the infrastructure--the superhighways--on today's movie landscape. Spielberg, Cameron, Scorsese, Scott (Tony), Lynne, Tarantino, Greengrass, Nolan, Greenaway, Tykwer, Verhoeven, Noe, Amoldavar, Jackson, Inarritu, Anno, Lee--when I see these names attached to any movie, I automatically know that the movie's going to at least be decent, if not, damn good. If Hollywood had a Mount Rushmore, Ridley Scott's image--and those of his contemporaries--should be deeply etched one stratum below the immortal images of Hitcock, Fellini, Bergman, Lang, Coppola, Powell, Kubrick, Kurosawa, etc. From BladeRunner, to Alien, to Gladiator, and now American Gangster, Ridley Scott's canon of films are among the best films ever.<br /><br />Now, to my two exceptions: First, Denzel Washington. The man ages like wine. Like DeNiro or Clint Eastwood, Washington is a ticket pull all by himself. His presence and machismo overpowers the screen. He makes a bad movie watchable. In fact, I can't recall the last bad movie he starred in, which speaks a lot of his intelligence in selecting quality scripts.<br /><br />Secondly, there's Russell Crowe. Like Denzel, Russell Crowe is a man's man in every role he plays, whether he's playing good-guy or bad-guy it doesn't matter. He proves that the leading man doesn't have to be Brad-Pitt-pretty-boy to be a Hollywood leading man. Russell's got the kind of durable rugged looks and powerful rottweiler build you're likely to see on some guy in the middle of the road driving a jackhammer through the pavement. Or the kind of guy you'd envision out on probation--the kind of guy you wouldn't want to see at night in a dark alley. Like Denzel, Russell can carry a movie on his back, and also like Denzel, Russell knows how to select quality scripts.<br /><br />American Gangster is the story of Frank Lucas and his rise to the pinnacle of Harlem's organized crime world. Under the tutelage of his ailing mentor, Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas foresees the end of the old model of organized crime based on middlemen, exaggerated profits, and diluted product. Young Lucas is Johnson's personal driver and sole prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Following Johnson's death, Harlem's drug scene washes into a violent free-for-all with up and comers battling to succeed Bumpy as Harlem's kingpin. Meanwhile, Frank Lucas is aloof. Even before Bumpy's death, Frank had been quietly formulating his own schemes for life and crime AFTER ol' Bump, who'd constantly lament about the good old days of customer service, middlemen, and respect among thieves. Bumpy's death frees Frank to do business a different way.<br /><br />He disrupts the monopoly of the New York Italian Mafia. Frank personally flies to Asia and establishes a direct link to smuggle heroin into the U.S.  He enlists a distant cousin, U.S. Army sergeant Leslie \\"Ike\\" Atkinson, to transport his dope into the U.S. inside the coffins of dead soldiers. With no middlemen, Frank's dope, called Blue Magic, is 100% pure on the streets of Harlem. Frank organizes his immediate family and cousins in ancillary posts--or fronts--throughout his drug network, from processing, measuring, and packaging, to receiving and distribution. Because Frank carries himself conservative and low-key, he's able to avoid the cops.<br /><br />Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a persistent New Jersey Cop determined to find out who's taken over Bumpy's turf. For a while, Frank is invisible. Then, one night he makes a big mistake. He shows up at an Ali fight in full regalia, draped from head to toe in mink and chinchilla, and festooned in diamonds and gold. He's shaking hands with the movie stars, the boxers, and the Mafia figures. Richie Roberts spies all of this from a distance through his binoculars--now the cops know who has taken over Bumpy's turf.<br /><br />Richie, however, has his own problems; he's a poor and honest cop. Discovering almost one-million dollars in the trunk of a car, Richie does the wrong thing and turns in the money without divvying it up with the force. His wife is leaving him because he makes peanuts as an honest cop.<br /><br />Both Richie and Frank are opposite sides of a coin: want of money disrupts Richie's life; wealth is not enough to prevent Frank's marriage and family from disintegrating. Richie's on the right side of the law, and Frank's on the wrong side of the law. Both lose everything.<br /><br />From the music, the sets, the cars, and the costumes, American Gangster is solid entertainment all the way.over Bumpy's turf.

B000055Y0X|5.0|In this day and age, during these times of political uncertainty, a black comedy such as `Dr. Strangelove' is a welcome distraction.  It takes all of our fears about what our own society may come to and it throws it in our face with enough humor (scarily realistic humor) that we find ourselves laughing at what could possibly be our eventual future.  Stanley Kubrick has been my favorite director for some time now, and `Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is quite possibly his finest film (I still have a warm and fuzzy place in my heart for the anti-warm and fizzy movie known as `A Clockwork Orange')<br /><br />The film centers around panic in the white house when General Jack D. Ripper acts on his own accord to eradicate Communism by launching a squadron of B-52 bombers over the Soviet Union.  When the Soviet reacts by threatening to use their Doomsday Device the President finds himself in the middle of heated debate on how to handle the current crisis.<br /><br />The film is littered with jabs at politics in general, with the country's fascination with war and the crazy ideas floating around the heads of the men in power.  Taking a more subtle approach to the films humor, Kubrick's gem of a film fairs much greater than most other parodies like `Blazing Saddles' (I need to stop hating on that film) for it actually manages to make all of its jokes work.  The film is genuinely hilarious, but it never sacrifices its intelligence for a quick laugh.<br /><br />Kubrick has a wonderful bedmate in Peter Sellers, who previously worked with Kubrick on the equally subtle yet effective comedy `Lolita'.  Sellers takes on three separate roles in this film; the President, Captian Lionel Mandrake and the bomb maker Dr. Strangelove.  He dominates this film by creating three completely different characters with different ideals and even accents, and he nails each one.  He's aided by the hilarious George C. Scott (who makes those `war room' scenes unforgettable) and Sterling Haydem, who captures the realness of human insanity.  These actors create such real, yet exaggerated characters that give the film such authenticity within its humor.<br /><br />The scary thing about `Dr. Strangelove' is that, in all honesty, it's probably not that far fetched.  Today more so than ever the general public has a pretty good idea of just how manipulative and chaotic our world leaders really are, so when watching a supposed comedy like `Dr. Strangelove' it becomes more and more dramatic as we put the pieces together.  I remember feeling the same way when watching the more recent `Wag the Dog', another political comedy.  They always say that reality makes for the best comedy because real life is almost always unbelievable; and this film is a real case-in-point, for it is as funny as it is scary.<br /><br />In other words; it's funny cuz' it's true.g Haydem, who captures the realness of human insanity.

I gotta be honest with you. The standard version's alright. But it's not for me. I think the Japanese Version is a completed version. The original one runs 43:43. This one runs 60:45. I like all four of the bonus tracks. But my favorite is Get Back.

I hated this album the day it came out.  HATED it.  Listened to it yesterday in order to test my resilience to all things relevant and to my suprise I loved it. All of those selling this for a penny (Im talking to you used CD store owners with a boatload of copies of this CD)-- I ould suggest just handing them out in any parking lot you may happen to find yourself in.  Going to get groceries?  --see that kid over there?  He doesnt have a copy of REMs Monster....

B00180R06I|5.0|The Criterion Collection will shortly be releasing a two disk version of the 1932 black and white classic horror film by Carl Theodor Dreyer, Vampyr. I first watched this film about twenty years ago, on a VHS release, and, unlike many others, immediately recognized it as a supernal piece of cinema. Then, I did not have the critical knowledge to discern why, but I do now, and will explicate. This film was the first sound film released by the Danish filmmaker, and perhaps the last film in the vein of silent German Expressionism. That stated, it is a very different form of vampire film from the then contemporaneous Dracula, made by Tod Browning, for Universal Studios in America, as well the earlier explicitly Expressionistic take on the film, 1922's Nosferatu, by F.W. Murnau. While the two other horror films have risen to the stature of iconographic symbols of evil and fear (as well a bit of hokum, with the passing of decades), Vampyr has not; although it still retains a creepiness that, to modern eyes, makes it a more unsettling experience than the two other films, great as they are.<br /><br />  The primary reason for this has not to do with blood and gore, nor even with mood, mis-en-scene, or the like, but with the fact that Dreyer and cinematographer Rudolph Mat&eacute; do not merely make the viewer observe what is going on, but also feel it, by using narrative and filmic devices that elicit empathy from the viewer, by emotional and intellectual means. As example, characters are frequently entering the frame from odd angles- sometimes they seemingly walk around the back of the camera; other times the camera pans to a place, to make the viewer believe a character will enter, only to have the character enter the frame from where the camera just left. Also, there are dolly shots (and reverse ones) where the point of view morphs from the presumably subjective to the demonstrably objective, as the character whose point of view we presume we are seeing then includes said character. At other times, two differing points of view are used. Then there are the more manifest devices- the use of shadows that seem detachable from their material casters, or those that seem to have an ability to act upon the material (a shadow that seemingly murders a man), or images that have no logical place in the narrative, yet whose appearance enhances it greatly in a Keatsian Negatively Capable way (a shadow that seems to not be digging a grave, but filling one up, as dirt seems to flow into its shovel at its apex, or odd characters who grimace and stare at the camera, but whose presence and/or import to the tale are never explained). The film's hero, too, is often seen glaring through things- windows, openings, holes- to see the world framed in a way different from reality. Yet, we also see him framed obversely through the frames; thus we empathize with him, even as we realize the limits he may not, just as the viewer is limited by what is in the frame. Also, some of the later outdoor scenes were filmed through filters which give the film a blanched quality that Dreyer strove for- to give a more shroudy appearance (rather than merely foggy), yet which lends the film a dreamy quality that visually is unmatched, even by many later film advances in obfuscation via special effects. Dreyer famously remarked that he was more interested in mood than story for this film, yet, his transcendent use of mood becomes the story, even as we are drawn to it not by its moodiness, but the engendered psychological empathy that Dreyer's visuals impose on us. Dreyer's thesis was this: `Imagine we are sitting in an ordinary room. Suddenly we are told that there is a corpse behind the door. In an instant, the room we are sitting in is completely altered: everything in it has taken on another level; the light, the atmosphere have changed, though they are physically the same. This is because we have changed....This is the effect I want to get.' And he succeeds. In another scene, a room darkens as a door opens, because the source of light is blocked. Little touches like this, which play against the infused logic of reality, help Dreyer displace the expected into the unexpected, where real fear dwells; and this is only accentuated by the fact that the film was one of the first to be shot entirely on real world locations, not in a studio....  Vampyr is one of the few early sound or silent films (indeed, it almost seems to occupy an artistic place all its own, midway between the two forms of film) that still works as well as it did upon its release because, unlike Dracula or Nosferatu, its horror was never based in the `reality' of the day, rather the never-changing reality of the human psyche. It could be dreamt by someone today, a century ago, or five hundred years from now. Its disjunctions and contradictions are the real seed of its horror, not monsters nor that which goes bump in the darkness. In a sense, this film gave birth to the sort of `adult horror' that the RKO pictures of Val Lewton exploited a decade later, rather than the more puerile horror that came after the first few classic monster flicks put out by Universal in the 1930s. Dreyer relies on subversions of the ordinary to create horror, not blood and gore, which only produce shock and disgust. Yet, the film also acted as a precursor (by two to three decades) to films that sought psychological depth from characters and tales that did not rely on plot driven action. For these, and reasons too many to enumerate, it is a film that has rightly earned the appellation classic, as well as great film. Perhaps, some day, Criterion will release a DVD set that, like Orson Welles' Mr. Arkadin, will incorporate elements from both the German and French versions of the film (as well as rumored Danish scenes and intertitles) to construct a `Definitive' version of Vampyr. But, until then, The Criterion Collection version of this film (based upon a 1998 reconstruction of the German version of the film) is the best place to start.rkens as a door opens, because the source of light is blocked.

I've completed all of my theory and ear training at a top level college institution, and I can tell you that I've learnt more about theory in the first 45 pages of this book than 2 years of outdated theory. Conservatories must update their teaching, and jazz theory is the closest that I see to today's music and musical understanding. Buy this book.
0345444051|3.0|Childhood's End is 1 of the earliest novels in the oeuvre of Arthur C. Clarke, & 1 of his best. 1 of the interesting things about reviewing very successful works long after their debut is how their very success can sometimes make the work seem less than it originally was. This is because the success of its themes, images, or narrative become so copied that they become clich&eacute;d. Such is the case with CE's opening. Giant spaceships arrive at earth, hover over the major cities of the world & issue ultimata. Is it the film Independence Day? Is it the tv miniseries V? No, but now you know where they got their openings....On a higher level there is the notion that what ACC propunds in this book is sharply contradicted by his own later stated beliefs- such as the tragedy he sees as being the hijacking of morality by organized religion. ACC seems to embrace psi phenomena, as well his repudiation of irrational religion. The original editions of this book featured a disclaimer from ACC stating he did not necessarily endorse the book's views- i.e.- that the irrational is a seductive force that will ultimately save (or doom?) mankind. Despite the seeming happy ending the destruction of homo sapiens, the fact that it was not allowed its natural evolution, simply to appease some super-powerful entity, is not what all would see as a positive. In a sense, the book can be seen as a Cold War fable (1st published in 1953)- a screed against Communism, which offered paradise on earth. The Overmind ends up destroying the planet, yet the reader never really gets a glimpse of what awaits. It could all be a hoax- the Overmind just a psychic predator feasting on the willingly gullible human spirit. Karellan states, `The stars are not for Man.' & by book's end we take it to mean that he meant mankind's disembodied descendants would reach the stars, not man. Yet, there is still the nagging feeling that humanity was flushed down a cosmic storm drain, & the more obvious meaning of Karellan's charge is the most apt.<br /><br />  Yet, ACC suggests that such skepticism is the result of our linear, physical minds- & that is the point of his tale. A final point is that the novel works as both a historical marker, & a still relevant treatise on human nature- whether you buy its premises & conclusions is another matter.rge is the most apt.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|When I first watched this movie, I had no knowledge of its historical context.  I just thought that it was a fictional story set in 15th or 16th century England.  As I watched it though I quickly realized that it is one of Henry VIII's many love stories.  Before viewing the movie I had little knowledge about Henry VIII other than he had six wives whom he beheaded.  I was intrigued by the plot of the story and decided to investigate into the history of his rule a bit further.  I quickly found out though that the details of The Other Boleyn Girl are not entirely accurate.      I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for over-the-top drama in a historical movie, rather than accurateness.  I enjoyed watching the movie because I had little knowledge about the historical background beforehand and felt the tension unfold as the characters' relationships became more and more complex.      As far as the script and dialogue, don't expect to look for any deeper meaning beyond the text.  Enjoy the movie for what it is rather than what you expect it to be.  If you like complex soap-opera-like drama then you will definitely enjoy this movie.

B00014K5TQ|4.0|'Party Monster' is the true story of Michael Alig, a notorious Club Kid, who in 1996 murdered a nobody drug dealer known as Angel.  Birthed in the 80's, the Club Kids were the legendary sparkle of the wild club scene populated by Andy Worhol types and flamboyant gays and drag queens.<br /><br />Michael (played by Macauley Culkin) bursts into the scene, weaseling his way in through celebrated contributor James St. James (played by Seth Green).  He makes a name for himself by organizing club parties, usually starring cleaver wielding singer Christina (played by Marilyn Manson, who shows up surprisingly thicker than I thought he'd be).  As his reputation builds, so does his popularity, until he's sitting pretty right on top of the scene.  James remains Michael's best friend, though it's a love/hate relationship.  James has always been a drug user, but as Michael falls into the abyss of drug use, his personal and society lifestyles change for the worse.<br /><br />The movie is peppered with a soundtrack of 80's tunes, perfect for the setting.  The costumes are wild and realistic to the fashions of the Club Kids.  The movie could have used more club scenes, since the clubbing is all the \\"kids\\" lived for.  Both Seth Green and Macauley Culkin give great performances.  It must be a drag for Culkin to always be associated with his child films, it would be nice if he could overcome the stigma like Ron Howard did.<br /><br />Be sure to read the book 'Party Monster' written by James St. James about the murder, and if you can, watch for the real life story of Michael Alig (with the real Michael) aired on American Justice.<br /><br />While good, the movie fails to live up to great.  I feel the association Michael and James had was too light for what I know of the real life murder, and too much of the club incidents were left out (like Michael's birthday Bloodfest party).  Still, if you're interested in the case you should watch the film.  Rent first.  Enjoy!
160459201X|4.0|I thought the ideas in this book were very good. The advice is solid and can help anyone overcome most challenges that life may hand them.The only item I found disappointing was the disclaimer near the front of the book that talks about the book not representing the values of today because it was a product of its time. I believe the book was written over 40 years ago. In my mind this book is a classic with the insight it gives.  Tim Gibney
B00003CXCT|5.0|As I'm quite sure you know the basic storyline of Star Wars, I am just reviewing the features of this set. I really enjoyed the quality of the remastered movies. I saw the special editions in the theater, but these include even more updates, such as character continuity with Anakin and Palpatine. I never owned the complete original series before (tho I've always been an avid fan), so I am happy with it.
1881273156|5.0|Someone lent me this book. I loved it so much, I bought a copy for myself. I think everyone should read it who has or wants to have a relationship of any kind with anyone. I liked it so much, I bought the Five Love Languages for Teenagers and The Five Love Languages for Singles.    Mr. Chapman claims that there are five primary love languages: words of affirmation, physical touch, acts of service, receiving gifts and quality time. Although we all need to be loved in all the ways, there is one love language that is our primary love language. If we are not loved in this primary love language, then our love tank becomes empty and we feel unloved, even if all four other love languages are being spoken to us.     So my conjecture is this may be then, why someone with the love language of words of affirmation would 'fish' for compliments, because they have a deep need to hear affirming words.    Happy reading!

B00009TB5G|5.0|I love the extended version of The Two Towers because you get more storyline, more action, and more character development. It also has more beautiful scenery. It's been a couple of days since the Fellowship broke up into 3 groups. Merry and Pippin have been taken by Ors and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to help find them. Frodo and Sam continue their journey closer to Mordor. You are introduced to new characters, like Grima Wormtongue, Eomer, Eowyn, King Theoden, Gollum, Treebeard, and a lot more. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find that Gandalf is still alive. Frodo and Sam seek help from Gollum on getting to Mordor. Saruman sends his Orcs to Rohan, so the people flee to Helm's Deep where a huge battle takes place. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are taken by Boromir's brother; Faramir who wants to take the ring to Gondor. If you love battles, fantasies, and epics, you'll love THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS!!!
B001B71NOI|4.0|I should start off by saying I've never been the biggest NIN fan. I've heard a decent amount of their music, and I've always liked them but they just never stuck with me. With Teeth seemed a bit like the sellout point to me, and I didn't pay attention to them for awhile. When I heard The Slip was free on their site, I eagerly downloaded it, and I've gotta say it's absolutely AMAZING! With the exception of Corona Radiata (which I'm sure will grow on me soon), there is not a dull moment with The Slip, and I plan to order Ghosts I-IV ASAFP.    Update: I forgot how depressing NIN is. Listening to it makes me feel like bashing my skull in, but it's such amazing music that I CAN'T TURN IT OFF! Also, With Teeth doesn't seem as bad now.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|After several runs through this album I'm really not sure what to think yet. I'm a fan from way back. This is the band that shaped my musical tastes in Metal and James Hetfield was the guy I wanted to be when I was 16 years old. I'm 32 now and Metallica remains very vital to me. I have lived through the highs and lows of this band with them. Unlike many old  fans, I thought the Black Album was awsome. In songs like \\"Until it Sleeps\\", \\"King Nothing\\", \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" I found a way to defend the band through the Load/Re-Load years.<br /><br />St. Anger... well some things are just too hard to defend. But I do like \\"Frantic\\" and \\"Some Kind of Monster\\".<br /><br />Production-wise, this their best studio album. Gone are the cookie-can drums of St. Anger and the buried waaay down in the mix guitars of the Black Album. And the drums are not overpowering all other instruments for the first time since \\"Master\\". The mix is crisp, not too dry like \\"Justice\\" or Extremely drowned in reverb like the Black Album. I think Rick Rubin has been an incredible positive on the way the band records their music. So, what is the problem???<br /><br />Well, to make a long story short, I don't hear anything memorable. No matter if you are a fan from way back or from the Black album on, you could always appreciate the songwriting of this band. You would pop one of their albums for the first time and it would stick with you long after you stopped listening. This is simply not happening to me with this album and its kind of killing me inside because I so want to like this record.<br /><br />Trying to look at the positives here, there are some albums that do grow on you and as you listen to them more, the more you like them. This could be the case here which is why I leave the final veredict for later.<br /><br />Overall, this is the heaviest and most aggresive the band has sounded probably since Justice. Too bad the songwriting is not as memorable.
B000Y9PILI|5.0|Those that have heard this album, song by 'simple song', might feel a new rush of delight choosing to sample the DVD first.   In 1971 Nash had blazed a trail with 'Songs for Beginners' -- but by 2008 he has revisited and enhanced its whole terrain.  The music has been remixed using the 'surround' concept one enjoys when hearing 'Songs for Survivors' -- making beloved songs fresh again.   And it is a blessing for all involved that clever, clever Graham gets to share his artistic vision with his lucky, lucky audience.  No one even remotely involved or interested in the creative process should miss that interview.  Period.    Not to be missed, and better than a mere replacement of a worn out vinyl copy.   Well done, Mr. Nash and all others concerned, well done.

B001CIPU3G|2.0|On Shogun, Trivium resume the path to mediocrity they briefly strayed from with 2006's The Crusade. The shopworn aggro metalcore the band continue to practice was barely passable when they released their sophomore disc in 2005: in 2008 it's just embarrassing. While The Crusade showcased a slight evolution for the band, Shogun throws conceptions like \\"logical progression\\" and \\"artistic development\\" to the wind. In all earnestness, it's very likely the dullest and most redundant metal album of the year. There is absolutely nothing on Shogun to differentiate it from Ascendancy, or even their debut album Ember to Inferno. Despite his overt talent at purveying conventional thrash metal vocals, singer Matt Heafy chooses to monotonously scream his way through most of the album, forgoing actual singing in an abrasive attempt to prove his manhood. The album bombards you with trite, uninventive riffs, generic metal scales, and horrendous vocals without offering even a moment of respite from the tough-guy metalcore comprising the entirety of the disc's 11 tracks. Simply put, listening to Shogun is a chore. You'd be well advised to simply pass this one by in favor recent discs from superior practitioners like In This Moment and Bullet For My Valentine instead.
B001FXCE46|4.0|Just because there are fans who have \\"followed KOL from the beginning\\" that don't really like this album doesn't make it a bad album. In fact it's quite the opposite; they've made a restrained, beautiful with a few songs that still fill the need for raw southern angst. I think we are finally able to see what Caleb can do with the vocals on this record. In the previous records, which I did like but he did variations on a scream and here we get to here harmony and he is a little smoother and the guy has some killer pipes. He seems more in control of his voice. The instrumentation is sublime in parts and really fits the whole tone of the album. Look, it never fails that \\"fans\\" will always want a band to continuously repeat the same album of material over and over just so the \\"fans\\" can be happy. What about the band being happy? Did anyone bother to think of it from that angle? These guys are artists and an artist never wants to do the same thing for too long; it's called creativity. These guys went out on a creative limb for this record by making something that I believe they knew would not be received well by long time \\"fans\\" but they did it anyway because they're true to themselves and that honesty is all you can ask for from an artist. I think it took guts to make a record like this, coming from the albums they've had before and I think it is a huge success. Can't wait to see what comes next

B000SM7QUC|5.0|The Heroin Diaries Sountrack was never intended to be the typical head-banging, fist thrusting album.  This is NOT Motley Crue.      What we have here is, I think, exactly what Nikki Sixx intended: REALLY GOOD music that captures the pain of an addict's darkest year.  The more \\"diaristic\\" tracks are just as powerful as the songs.      I recommend buying this album, as well as the book.  They can stand alone, but together, the experience becomes so much more powerful.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|My general rule about Blu-ray is that I will not replace a DVD I already own with a Blu-ray DVD. Like every good rule, it should have a few exceptions and Planet Earth is one of them.    This series was made for Blu-ray.The photography, stunning even on standard definition, is astonishing in 1080p. As the camera moves from helicopter sweeps of vast herds of yaks on the high plains of Mongolia, to elephants emerging ghostlike from high grasses in India to vibrant underwater vistas of barrier reefs teeming with tropical life, we get a sense of our own relative place on our blue ball.    David Attenborough's career has been devoted to the interface between the communication arts and the natural sciences. He is the perfect narrator for such an ambitious series, bringing scientific credibility together with a classic BBC voice. Attenborough is no mere narrator however. He is the principal writer of this award winning series.    Once you have committed to HDTV and Blu-ray this should be an essential part of your collection, even if you already own the standard definition DVD.

B001CISHU4|5.0|First of all, this album can and will be described as a great many things.  In my words this album is amazing.  It's still the same Amon Amarth you know and love but they've expanded on their already power-house formula to bring you a mix of both the old and the new.    While I *still* have mixed feelings about some of the guest work that Children of Bodom guitarist Roope Latvala and Apocalyptica did on a couple of the tracks - mostly the quick Dragonforce-style effects laden taps that were done on \\"Twilight of The Thunder God\\" (I know it's just Roope Latvala's style), but I didn't think it was that necessary. Not that it's a \\"BAD\\" performance - It's DAMN GOOD - it's just a bit... out of place on an Amon Amarth album. I think it will be what most people quickly identify as the \\"new\\" in the title of the review.    Other than that, it's business as usual.  Brutal Nordic-themed death metal.  The riffs are still catchy and recallable hours after listening to the album.  New twists to their wind and string instrumental use (Ala Apocalyptica) is also a welcomed and unexpected addition.  The bonus DVD is a nice touch, too.  I've always liked that Amon rarely gives you 'just' the CD.  The Artwork on the album bares mentioning, as well.  Returning album artist Thomas Ewerhard still stays true to the iconic Amon Amarth art style.    I didn't think that \\"With Odin..\\" could be topped, but I shame myself for doubting that it couldn't be.  They have remained one of my favorite bands for almost 6 years now and they have yet to disappoint me.    Pick this one up as soon as you can.  You will not regret it!
B000YENUI6|4.0|wow...I liked it on the big screen and this is almost as good. Viggo Mortensen is certainly versatile, and adding this to his wide body of work is cool. Sometimes it was difficult to know where the story is located, but I suppose that's a realistic pitcure of how groups can change city locales. The story moves well and the end is very satisfying.

They are well made and stand up to many, many hours of play. I saved my children's and they look brand new...the newer ones probably will too! (The 4 stars on the \\"fun\\" rating is an error--should have been 5 but I can't go back and edit it....)
0312263120|1.0|Having read Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Digital Fortress I can only say he spins a good story if you can get past the nonsense.  This one was the hardest to get through and the absolute worst of those 3 (not that the other 2 are stellar either).  The plot is predictable and the characters are stupid (even though they hold degrees I can only dream of).  Others far more knowledgeable than I can tell you how bad the technical stuff was, my limited knowledge just made it bad enough to wish he'd done just a little research to make it sound a bit more plausible.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even an enemy.
0374531269|5.0|\\"Killing was as easy as drinking water\\" is the analogy Ishmael Beah uses to describe his time as a child soldier in the war-ravaged country of Sierra Leone. His memoir is a hard read, but a must read. The descriptions and details made me want to believe his tale was fiction, but sadly I knew it was not. Truth can be shocking and horrifying, but sobering as well.        Ishmael lost everything due to the war and was then recruited as a soldier for the government. The government! I have read countless stories about child soldiers for rebel armies, but this was news to me. These so-called government troops gave children the option of starving and going it alone or being taken care of by joining the army. High on drugs to the point of insomnia, the children were trained to fight anyone outside of their troop.        Reading this book made me angry. I felt a lot of emotions I don't like to feel. But to read this book and not feel those emotions is a crime. We in America need to be exposed to more stories like Ishmael's because we have more power to invoke change.        Ishmael was one of the lucky ones. UNICEF was able to rehabilitate him. Most child soldiers die, but even some who end up at a rehabilitation camp never heal. Many go back to the front lines because war is the only reality they know. Childhood memories have long been washed away with blood.       I urge you to read this book to educate yourself on issues not directly related to you. Read this book to feel someone else's pain. Read this book to see how the rest of the world often lives. Read this book to be grateful of where you live. And finally, read this book and refuse to forget Ishamel.
B000AADYUI|5.0|Across America, this was the sound of the \\"Basement Band\\" - a \\"Garage Band\\" was usually dudes who played \\"In A Gadda Da Vida\\"...until 10:15pm, when th drummer's Father said \\"I said 10 o'oclock, Ricky!\\". (With the exception of that exceptional all-girl Garage band out of Nashville, The Feminine Complex. But they apparently disbanded about one year before this album came out).<br />It wasn't an answer to the Rock Opera, \\"Tommy\\", but more of an alternate: it was an aural Science Fiction Fantasy, very loosed based upon a UFO encounter. But if you read the excellent notes to this edition, you'll discover that the real story was in the actual, hands-on, production grind.<br />For me, the best subtex is \\"A Child Is Coming\\", a Kantner/Slick/Crosby song with astonishing harmony and flow; and \\"Hijack\\", which has some of the sound of Neil Young on \\"Horse With No Name\\". But it stands alone - another beautifully arranged and recorded opus.<br />A nice \\"extra\\" is Grace Slick's 1:21 demo of \\"Sunrise\\". She takes on Julie London and scores, with her own torchy tremolo.<br />Unidentified pianist really provides a sonic undercurrent to help keep the \\"Ship\\" airborne. Joey Covington's well-tempered, somewhat muted, percussion is ominipresent, which contributes mightily to the chromatics.<br />Was this album, like the \\"UFO\\", really a....\\"Plane\\".<br />A Classic, either way.

031606792X|5.0|Now, how do I write a review about this book without giving too much away to both readers who have yet to read the Twilight saga and those who are about to read it, whichever book they're currently at? Tough.<br /><br />What's not tough though is telling you how much I have enjoyed the book and how magnetic it was. At 768 pages, I could be reading 3 Indiana Jones stories because that's what I have set out to do--to complete the entire series by end of this month. But I also needed closure to the human-vampire-werewolf saga so I embarked on BREAKING DAWN without hesitation.<br /><br />Let's get back to the story. Stephenie Meyer is wonderful in weaving a fairy-tale romance in an unlikely world of humans, vampires and werewolves. It's not all rosy because so much pain is involved before anyone could smell the roses. There's constant strife and plenty of it throughout the story. Bella is passionately and irrevocably in love with the forever-seventeen vampire, Edward Cullen (he's a century old, by the way). At the same time, she also loves her werewolf best friend, Jacob Black. Vice versa, both guys are willing to risk their all for her. Torn between the two, she has a difficult choice to make but it is obvious who she will pick. Her choice, no doubt, impacts the people around her in unthinkable ways. Really, one mortal teenage girl can cause so much havoc in the worlds of impossibly beautiful immortals and the shape-shifting wolves.<br /><br />As much as I would like to go on and on about what happened, and discuss about the book, I really should not be revealing the plot too much. There are three parts to the book, told in the voice of Bella and Jacob. So much emotion is packed into the story; it's dizzying in a good way. The first book, TWILIGHT remains my favourite in the saga.

0142410314|5.0|This is my first Roald Dahl book and I must say I love it! Highly imaginative and full of lessons, this book is a gem. I like the little boy Charlie very much and like most children, he is full of curiosity. He is also obedient for he listens to his parents, Mr and Mrs Bucket, and his very old grandparents. His family is poor and the seven of them live in a tiny, worn-down house. It is heartbreaking reading his family situation.<br /><br />One day, Mr Willy Wonka, a well-known chocolate maker who was missing in action for a long, long time comes back into business. As we know, Mr Wonka makes all sorts of wonderful, out-of-this-world, magical sweets. His chocolate-making secrets, having been copied before by other manufacturers (that's the reason he closed down and went `missing') he now protects them by hiring a mysterious workforce when he reopens. The workers are never seen to enter or exit from his factory--very strange. The action starts when Mr Wonka launches a competition with an irresistible prize: a visit IN the factory for five children! These children will be able to see how his secret chocolates are made and their adult guardians can come with them. To win, each of them must possess the golden ticket only found in Wonka chocolates! The world, of course, launches into a chocolate-buying frenzy. But Charlie, a chocolate lover, is so poor and could not even afford a decent meal, how could he afford to buy enough chocolates to get a chance to win one of the five golden tickets?<br /><br />The story gets even better when the five winners--all from different backgrounds and attitudes--get their tour in the factory. Four of them are spoilt brats in their unique ways, and the fifth one is Charlie (of course he got in)! What an experience each of these children and their parents (except Charlie for he brought his grandfather) go through! From the way Mr Wonka talks (as evident in the writing), he is an enthusiastic person. There are lots of exclamation marks punctuating his sentences and italics to emphasis his points. Besides all the intriguing stuff, the children also discover who the workers are. It is interesting to see how the children's mischief gets them into trouble in the factory.<br /><br />I love how Roald Dahl weaves the magical story so wonderfully and it was funny reading about the four obnoxious children. More interesting is how each `weird' incidence that happens during the tour is in direct relation to their naughtiness. Watch out for the twist towards the ending, too, because there is more to things than just the factory tour. This is an amazing tale.nces and italics to emphasis his points.

0375836675|4.0|Once I started getting into this book, it was definitely one that I could not put down. Each twist and turn in the story line engrossed me even more. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good read.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Im not an expert on  this stuff but I found this series to be one of the most well made, intelligent and emotionally engaging and engrossing story Ive ever seen. The acting is superb and the dialogue- pure heaven. I simply loved it I recommend it to everyone and anyone (including children).
141654917X|5.0|I had heard from numerous people that this book would shock you. I began reading it and loved the various points of view that the story is told. You feel compassion and emotions for all characters. Though there are many twists throughout this book, the end had me in tears. Another outstanding read by Jodi Picoult!
015206396X|5.0|Graceling is a well written book by first time author Kristin ashore. She is remarkably talented in her telling of the story. The book definitely demands your attention and qualifies as un-put-downable. For the plot and writing, I give it the full five stars. And here, I add my caveats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author does seem to take some of the precious space she is given between the covers to espouse an anti-marriage philosophy that may leave a mark on younger readers. If there were a solid cause for such a position, such as Katsa's witnessing terrible abusive marriage after terrible marriage, that would be one thing. No such events exist. For reasons never explained, the romance is developed beautifully with the decrying of marriage a central point. Kristin, WHY?????!<br /><br />Other than that, the only irksome part of this story is the names. Po? Middluns, Sunder? And worst of all, Bitterblue? I still am having trouble with the names. And, at first, when Kristin is developing her locations, I nearly laughed out loud at the immaturity of the naming. If you can get past that, this is a fantastic novel with a fully developed cast of characters. I wish I didn't have to wait so long for a sequel and that it picked up immediately rather than six years in the future.

0618918248|4.0|However good intentions Mr. Dawkins has when he wrote this book, it's like preaching to the choir: although there are a lot of \\"hidden atheists\\" or religion practioners who, deep inside, know about the absurdity and implausibility of the all-powerufl God above, the great majority of religious people are blind as a bat to the convicing and clear evidences of the falseness and evilness of organized religion.<br /><br />So, a brilliant book like this one will obtain almost nothing in his objective: opening the mind of people blinded by years of brain washing. So, only people who already share his views will like this book. It's like preaching to the choir.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I was mesmerized by what i know was a factual account of the founding of this country with John Adams as a main instrument in forming the birth and growth of this country,although he and all the founding fathers have turned in their grave many times as this country is not being run nor has it in many years as John Adams and the other founding fathers intended it to be run...They founded this country by the people,for the people and with the people's welfare first not they're own agenda as many Presidents since have....This program was educational as it was interesting and i could not wait until the next part was shown....This rates 5 stars twice over....

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Baby Boomers will love this show as they will feel comfortably familiar with the decor (being the early 60's), the attitudes (omg,how these businessmen treat their female workers....we've come a long way, baby!) and the story lines are not far fetched.  I chuckle at the \\"smoke in your eyes\\" and all the other double meanings!
B001C08RHA|2.0|Seen this show twice at the movies and bought the DVD today, picture is awesome but the sound sucks!  The special effects are loud and clear but the dialog is so low I can hardly hear what they are saying over the special effect sounds.  Tried it on my desktop (which has never had any problems playing dvd's) and my laptop, both have the same problems..  Not sure if I just got a bad DVD or not, going back to the store to exchange it for another.
031606792X|5.0|**SPOILERS BELOW**    I have to admit that this is not my favorite of the Twilight Saga but it was amazing nonetheless. I can see why people dont like it. I myself wanted to stop reading once I found out Bella was pregnant, it really creeped me out. But then reading Jacob's perspective made everything easier, because I could relate to him, he was seeing what everyone else was seeing. Then once Renesmee was born and I got to see how incredible she was, I acutally liked the turn that story took.     Now, on Bella getting married so young..whats the big deal? If you know Bella, you know isnt like any normal teenage girl, she is pretty mature for her age (sometimes i felt as though she would speak of her mom as a child)Besides, she wanted to be with Edward, and did not want to be that much older then him, that terrified her.   On the pregnancy and the baby..okay, yes it was creepy at the begining but in the end it was just perfect..  and on Jacob imprinting on Nessie. I dont find it disturbing, the whole idea of imprinting is explained in the other novels. I thought it was cool, how he would still always be connected to Bella in that way.    and so what if everyone got what they wanted. As a true Bella and Edward fan I couldnt have wanted it any other way. I thought it was amazing. What did people want? Something else horrible happen to Bella? as if she hadnt suffered enough..maybe if Meyer would have killed off Charlie or Nessie some readers would have been happy? I thought the ending was perfect and who doesnt love a happy ending? For once, Bella had everything she wanted and was happy about it. Unrealistic expectations? Hey, its fantasy and why not dream a little?

Their voices just evoke such emotion.      This story of how the Elphaba became the Wicked Witch of the West is interesting.  It reminds me of a noir story.  Every action has a consequence.  The music and songs are successful in conveying the complexity of the story.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Apparently not.<br />This man is the greatest living hollywood actor that i know of. He puts mind, heart, spirit and soul into his roles, his whole self it seems.<br />With each movie ive seen, he alone makes the movie, even if its not a masterpiece (john Q), he alone, his very performance, is worth the price of admission to get a seat in a packed theater.<br /><br /> American Ganster is no exception. A well done inspiring picture that tells the story of a man living outside of the law, who desired to give his family the best, whose strong work ethic took him to the top of his community, and the repercussions he was delt for the choices he made to get there. In short, he was very much his own man. Living above the lawful, and the lawless.<br /><br />I dont pretend to know the real life story of our main character, Frank Lucas, so i cant say if this is the truest most accurate depiction of how things went down, but i do know, that i was given an inspiring performance, with good supporting performances from Russel Crowe and others.<br /><br />As the movie progressed, around every corner , i was worried for Frank, i didnt want the man to get blown away. Thats how involving the film is, and thoughts how much i liked Frank's character. I dont know if id care much for the real man, but if he was anything like how Denzel portrayed him to be, then id be rooting for him.<br /><br />Its crazy, Mr. Washington can take even a criminal , an apparent bad guy, and make us get up and cheer when he gets away, or feel a genuine sense of concern when the characters life seems to be in danger.<br />He became this man, i totally forgot i was watching a movie, thats how good it was.<br /><br />Through all the harassment, the raids, the warrants, the attempts on his life, through all the crooked cops, through all the years, Frank Lucas had composure.<br /><br />Sure, he deserved what he got in the end, but hes no different than most people, trying to do something with themselves, who dont do things exactly like a saint would. But i think, out of all the gangsters ive seen portrayed in films...from Little Cesar to John Gotti, no one seemed as honest nor meant more well, than Frank Lucas.<br /><br />Now i could be very wrong, but this film made me a believer. It moved me. One of the best scenes ive ever seen a gangster film is probubly when Frank is confronted by his mother near the end when things start to fall apart....it was such a painful, emotional and powerful scene, between mother and son. I felt some tears in my eyes as i watched that part.<br /><br />Again, im not sure as to how historically accurate this film is. But based on how it was all done, it kept me coming back for more. Good high intensity moments, very good acting, a memorable story, a character you cant help but care about played by Denzel Washington, and i must note that Russell Crowe, who plays the cop whose in pursuit of Frank Lucas, does a good job in his role as well, although i just couldnt keep my self from wishing he'd fall in a ditch somewhere so that Denzel's character could get away and live happily ever after, but reality kicks in i guess.<br /><br /> If you like gangster films , i think this a welcome addition to the old black and white gangster films, to the 70s God Father films , to The Departed Film.  Though American Gangster is nowhere as grand or great as lets say, The Godfather, or as totally unforgettable as lets say, The Goodfellas......American Gangster tells the tale of a unique organised crime boss in Harlem, who wasnt of italian or irish decent, but was of african decent. Here we see a different world within organized crime...its not big guys doing buisness over a plate of pasta...the fellas in American Gangster are getting chinese take out! LOL<br /><br /> But in all seriousness, we see our share of self ran clubs, partys, big family dinners, and the \\"good life\\" and all that success brings...but its interesting to see it done with a different type of soul.<br />I tell ya, i would of loved to have lived in Frank Lucas's house, and have dinner with that family. Scenes of the times he had with family nearly made us forget he was who he was, you just wanted to see more time with him and his big family, how he took care of everyone, and how much love there was. But perhaps im over doing it. So ill leave you to your thoughts now, but im pretty sure you will like this film.<br /><br />I think it is worth buying, its good enough. Its not a sweeping gangster epic, but its a powerful film none the less. Denzel Washington does it again, this time portraying a true prince of the city.with that family.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|Please Note: Opinions are like...well you know how the saying goes. If you have one, write a review the voting system is for those who HAVEN'T purchased the item and whether or not the review was helpful in that decision.<br /><br />\\"Titanium Alloy Man\\" just doesn't have the same ring to it as \\"Iron Man\\". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is \\"The Merchant of Death\\" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark almost literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of iron that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by becoming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. Heck, even the DVD is one of the top notch ones I've seen in recent years. As for the issue with TrueHD sound--Paramount has fixed that issue remanufacturing the BD and still meeting their release date.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well.

0920668372|1.0|This book made the hackles on my neck stand straight up.  Absolutely creepy and odd.  It is one thing to rock your sleeping baby, quite another to sneak in your grown sons house (with a ladder no less), and rock him in his bed.  This book shows the exact opposite of how to be a healthy parent.  Cut the creepy apron strings.  DO NOT BUY !!!
B00005JPS8|5.0|PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS MY OPINION DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN OR PURCHASED THE MOVIE--YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY. IF YOU WANT INFO ON PICTURE/SOUND AND EXTRAS SKIP TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS.<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS ON THE TWO DISC SET. THE ONE DISC SET PRIMARILY HAS THE FEATURE FILM<br />THANKS!<br /><br />\\"Titanium Composite Man\\" just doesn't have the same ring to it as \\"Iron Man\\". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is \\"The Merchant of Death\\" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of metal that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by coming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The DVD looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. It's one of the top notch transfers  I've seen in recent years. Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well.

B001C08RHA|4.0|Not just another super-hero. The actors lift this and make it fly. As with all the great comicbook movies, it's not the fx, it's the heart. This is a fun one.
0439023483|5.0|I am an avid reader.  Yet I'm not often compelled to find the Amazon page and right a review for a book. . .<br /><br />but this book deserves it.  I found out about this book via a brief description in Entertainment Weekly (I think Stephen King mentioned it).  I found the idea compelling, and sought out the book.<br /><br />I've recently read \\"The Road\\" and \\"Pesthouse\\" (I'm not a Carmac fan . . .).  I found this book about 10x more addictive than either of those books.  Some literary scholar may point out a win on the other post-apocalyptic books. . .but in my mind a book is only as good as it keeps you from putting it down  - and I couldn't put this down.<br /><br />The story is from the point of view of a young teen girl, and I found it refreshing (even though I'm a full adult male).  The story is spot on, and the ending states \\"END OF BOOK ONE\\" leaves me a tad bit of hope - that the adventure in this world isn't finished. . .
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show had me hooked from the first season. I wondered how they would top that season, even though I'm not sure yet which one is better season 2 is great. Dexter is by far one of the best shows on TV.
0440243661|3.0|As I already said in the title, one of the weaker Reacher novels. At first I was excited that some of Reacher's old Army friends show up, but none of the characters is really developed and the entire story seems kind of flat. Also, as his pals are all doing well, Reacher has access to insane amounts of money in this one, which makes for some very unrealistic plot developments. My suggestion would be to skip this one.
B00005JPS8|5.0|First off. Everyone should know that the director wants to make this a trilogy. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. It is so fun! I personally liked this better than Spider Man & every other superhero movie. It is fun for adults and kids. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome! Thank you for bringing this movie into the world. This definitely goes in my top 10 movies of the year already. The acting and quality of the film is very good too.
0345495004|5.0|Great book!  We read this for our book club.  It was extremely helpful to have the discussion questions in the back of the book.  The seller sent the book very quickly and it was in excellent condition!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I'll bet that all the one star votes are from Republicans in the mid west who can't read.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|First off let me say, this album doesn't suck, which is better than what I can say about anything Metallica has put out in the last 10 years. Metallica is, by far, my favorite band and always will be but they've fallen off a long way. This CD is arguably better than anything they've released in the last 20 years. That being said, it still doesn't hold up to Metallica's golden age. I was sick of being disappointed by previous albums that said they would sound like their older material and never did...THE COOLEST THING ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THAT, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IT DOES SOUND LIKE SOME OF THE OLD STUFF. Which is awesome! I advise you to give this CD an open mind and I know that's asking a lot considering how disappointing their previous albums have been lately. It's not Puppets, it's not Justice or Lightning, but it still rocks if you give it the chance. I will definitely say this: the instrumental song on this CD \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" fits right at home with all of the old material. If nothing else, that one's definitely worth hearing. Maybe Metallica should do a CD of nothing but instrumental lol
B0019FOC5E|5.0|If you liked the movie you'll love the soundtrack. Each song takes you back to a scene and lets you relive the experience you enjoyed at the movie over and over again.
B001ACY8D2|3.0|3 1/2    Starting off briskly, the majestic quartet's up-tempo pop dabblings seem to have not hindered the new album at all, which includes something for everyone. Though they revisit their trademark sonic buildups and offer humble acoustic contrast, a certain balance just does not seem to have been struck in the track sequencing, tapering off in the final stretch, and often sounding like a collection of quite good b-sides instead of their latest release.
B001B71NOI|4.0|This album is really cool, I just wish it was a bit longer, and without so many instrumentals, but honestly I think this album would've been superior to both With Teeth and Year Zero if it was the average NIN length album.  The intro 999,999 is a really cool sounding intro, typical of NIN albums.  1,000,000 is a very drum-centered song, and the chorus is just incredibly melodic.  Getting Away is an anti George Bush song, I believe, with the chorus, \\"And we are letting you get away, and we are letting you get away, with it\\", I just get a complete feeling that he is talking about \\"Dubbya\\", very cool industrial beat to this one.  Discipline is a song which I completely relate to as a person who has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, it is about trying hard to stay clean, but knowing the possibility of relapse, and how you will act once you relapse.  This song is very radio-friendly, but do not let that ruin the fact that it is an awesome song, kind of sounds like Fragile-era NIN, which I absolutely loved.  Echoplex is also another Fragile-era NIN sounding song, I absolutely love this song, definitely one of my favorites from this album, the lyrics are incredible.  Head Down is a very noisy/industrial beat with an undeniably melodic chorus, the beat to this song is really fu**ing cool, I love it.  Lights In The Sky is a very, very slow song, with only Trents voice and a piano, not really my favorite song at all, but many people may love it.  Corona Radiata and The Four Of Us Are Dying are both instrumentals and very cool ones at that, they are very hallucinagenic and if you like hallucinogens, these would be cool tracks to throw on while experiencing that.  Demon Seed is the final track on the album and has a really cool beat, the music sounds like Downward Spiral-era NIN, really cool closer!  The vocals are kind of in the background to the beat in about half of this song, this track may take a few listens, but it is awesome.  Overall, this is a really solid NIN release, and I do not think it will disappoint hardcore NIN fans at all, and even newcomers to NIN will probably really like this one.  Pick it up or download it for free at NIN's website, and support this cool band, and really cool dude Trent Reznor!  Trent is one of the most influential and original artists of all time, he is the reason that other forms of rock started infusing industrial elements into their music!
B000002BYD|3.0|3 1/2    With each successive release prompting fans to curb their enthusiasm, it is no wonder this album was met with general praise even if general quality was slowly diminishing.
0375826726|5.0|AMAZING read!    and well worth the wait. Christopher Paolini stays true to the story line, and the fourth book will be outstanding, can't wait.[[ASIN:0375826726 Brisingr (Inheritance, Book 3)]]
B001CIPU3G|5.0|I became a fan of Trivium after hearing Ascendency.  Their sound reminded me of classic Metallica (before they went all soft and pathetic).  Powerful lyrics, great guitar riffs and exceptional drumming.  Shogun is just another example of how metal music should sound.  This release by far is their best to date.  With this CD, the band seems to find a new way to get more aggressive.  Lyrically, musically - this one is GREAT!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|It's a pity that this season only has 16 episodes, but still an awesome season. No need to say how good the show is...just hope the DVD can have more extras
B001GAPC1K|5.0|What can you say about the Marvel Universe when it comes to life on the big screen (with the exception of X-Men 3).  Another triumph - especially with RDJ playing Tony Stark.  The guy is just that great and believable.  You can follow the storyline from beginning to end and there are no character flaws that I can see.  If you liked Iron Man as a kid, this is going to blow you away.
0375842209|5.0|I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this book given the subject matter.  I loved it. I found the story haunting and thought provoking. Markus Zusak's writing is creative and poetic. I definitely encourage readers to check this one out.
0471702188|5.0|This was the first time i purchased a book online. Transaction was simple and services were prompt.
B000002H6C|3.0|I know I am in the minority here, but to me this is Metallica's most overrated album.  I almost feel guilty for feeling this way about \\"Justice\\" since so many others think it's a masterpiece.  Makes me wonder why I don't \\"get it.\\"  Maybe it's the shoddy production.  My God, I have blues recordings from the 1920's and '30s that are better produced than this.  There is no excuse for an album recorded in the late 80s to be this poorly mixed.  Where is the bass? Why do the drums sound like pop guns?  Second, some of these songs seem to be long just for the sake of being long.  Mind you I have nothing against long songs, but some of these songs in particular the second half of the album, seem to go on forever.  It's not that they are bad songs but they seem to go nowhere with nary a hook to be found.  I guess in short I find several of the songs to just be boring.  On the positive, \\"Blackened\\", \\"Justice\\", and \\"One\\" are great tunes.  But as a whole this just doesn't hold up and doesn't compare to \\"Master Of Puppets\\" or \\"Ride The Lightning\\".  I would even probably put \\"Kill 'Em All\\" ahead of \\"Justice\\".  Granted the songwriting and lyrics were much more mature on \\"Justice\\" and the intentions were good, but IMHO this is far from the masterpiece some would have you believe.  Maybe if this gets re-mastered I'll change my mind.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As a Doc 4 over 30 yrs. worldwide, I would say this movie is a terrific wake-up call for the American general public.

0120884674|5.0|As far as forensic books go, it's very well-written, with good illustrations, and is very cost-efficient and easy to carry around. Aimed at field work, so the pointers (i.e. which bones are potentially confused with others) are very helpful. Could use some color and more diagrams, but for the price I paid for it, I'm not complaining.

0670020745|5.0|\\"My Stroke of Insight\\" - at this point in time (2008) - requires no introduction or endorsement for that matter.  It's a uniquely executed concept predicated on a too-common-of-a-story that had been beginning to be told.  And finally has been...<br /><br />What I would like to emphasize in this brief review is its unintended explanatory value for understanding meditational experiences, namely, that of ego-less-ness.<br /><br />As such, \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" makes a nice reading companion to James Austin's (neuroscientist too) \\"Zen and the Brain.\\"  Whereas Austin provides a first-person narrative of his meditational experiences through a neuoroscientific lens, Dr. Taylor, of course, narrates the experience of a left-hemispheric stroke through the lens of her education.  When read together, these two books offer a rather intriquing \\"triangulation\\" of the underlying neurophysiology of the meditational experiences.<br /><br />\\"My Stroke of Insight\\" - as a book - will likely enjoy a long half-life in the market-place of books.  My prediction is that it will enjoy an even longer life as supplemental reading to any student of neuroanatomy and/or meditation.<br /><br />This is a triumphant anthem to brain plasticity!<br /><br />Pavel Somov, Ph.D.<br />Author of \\"Eating the Moment: 141 Mindful Practices to Overcome Overeating One Meal at a Time\\" (New Harbinger, Nov. 2008).
B00180R06I|5.0|Criterion has done a magnificent job in the production of this handsome, hefty, lovely-to-hold DVD package literally packed with all-sorts-of goodies.  You get two DVDs in a gothic three-fold holder and the screenplay and short story that influenced the film in a neat little volume. The DVDs and their slipcase and the book are neatly contained in a further casing that is chillingly evocative in its design.  This is the perfect gift for the imminent Halloween - and watching this film is a perfect way to kick off the start of October.<br /><br />This movie was released in 1932, shot a few years prior.  There are, of course, no CGI effects (thank God!). There are no grotesque makeups and over-the-top transformations as in many recent vampire/horror films. There aren't gallons - or even cupfulls of blood - and yet this film...this film is perhaps the most uncanny, weirdest, chilling \\"horror\\" movie ever made.  Not because it is shock scarey, no, but because it is silently scarey.  It is shadows-in-sunshine scarey.  It is downright creepy!  One of the best examples of what I'm talking about is an all-of-twenty second or so scene of ghost shadows dancing on a wall to weird music and a weird shadowy band that - in twenty-some seconds mind you - does more to haunt a man's soul than the entire \\"The Shining\\" by Kubrick with its own lavish many-peopled ghost party in the Gold Room (which I love!) or the Dance of the Dead in the classic \\"Carnival of Souls\\" (which I love also).  It is truly amazing that with no CGI or big budget or latex makeup applications to simulate monsters and ghouls, this movie - and this one scene in particular - can unnerve and haunt and stay with you, long after you've watched the film's economical 73 minutes.  What did the great director Dreyer have that makes this film so powerful?  A rich and poetic Imagination! Visual and aesthetic Brilliance! Knowing how to edit in order to unnerve the viewer.  And there is so much packed into these hallucinatory 73 minutes: the potent image early on of the bellringer with the scythe, the river before him, his back to us...and a face we can only imagine and DO NOT want to see!  A disembodied shadow seating itself beside it's owner.  Another shadow shovelling in reverse motion that is absolutely inexplicable and therefore bone-chilling.  A woman's face slowly becoming overtaken by evil that is scarier than anything I've seen done with makeup or special effects:  her rolled up eyes and malevolent smile are precursor's to the first shot of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance in the aforementioned \\"The Shining\\" when we first know he is going mad.  The crazy doctor in the ground-breaking film is also a dead-on precursor of Jack MacGowran's eccentric Professor Ambrosius in Polanski's \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\" (which I also love). The vampire in the film is totally against type - and thereby more fearful than those with dripping fangs and blood-shot eyes in later-day films. The much-commented upon sequence wherein our hero is being buried alive is likewise alone worth the price of admission.  I could go on and on with the influences this film initiated in horror films down the years, but it is best to check it out for yourself.  It puts Tod Browning's \\"Dracula\\" to shame, actually, despite the great Bela Lugosi (whom I love).  No, this is not even so much a film as a dream/nightmare caught on film.  It is perhaps as close to the world of the Dead as we, the viewers, might dare get...without crossing over ourselves! Yet! Strange, surreal, sublime: it must be seen to be believed.minutes: the potent image early on of the bellringer with the scythe, the river before him, his back to us...and a face we can only imagine and DO NOT want to see!

0679809015|5.0|My grand daughter likes it.  Good book for young children with the flaps to open.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Al Pacino and Robert Dinero absolutely SIZZLE in this film. Michael Mann adds his brand of visual seduction, as the film's \\"blue\\" look and atmospheric music and scenes add a spectacular feel to this film. The \\"cat and mouse\\" game is complicated by the fact that we learn about the personal lives of all lead characters, and it truly allows you to \\"cheer for the bad guy\\". The movie, minute by minute, is one of the best crime sagas ever created. Fanastic cinema, highly recommended!
031606792X|5.0|[[ASIN:0316033413 Twilight Collector's Edition (The Twilight Saga)]]    When my sister first told me about this Saga I was a little skeptical, vampires and humans clashing...but...Now...Everyone seriously should read this saga, it is amazing, and so easy to read and reread.  I love the entire saga and now I am passing it on to my friends.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Ryan Gosling's time to shine! He is very gifted in his subtle ability to convey emotion, and in this film he truly shines. Anthony Hopkins adds the seasoned exceptional performance of the offender, and throughout the movie, we are asked to solve a puzzle. It's a very stylish thriller, and worth a look!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I have to admit, I'm an avid listener of classical music. So it's a small wonder why Disney's Fantasia is one of my favorite films. Every music sequence is pure gold (except maybe the Pastoral sequence).<br /><br />Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach = My second favorite sequence, it is a mixture of abstract colors & images, live action orchestral playing, and Stokowski's acclaimed orchestration of Bach's organ music.<br /><br />Nutcracker Suite by Peter Illich Tchaikovsky = Although I'm not a fan of Tchaikovsky's ballet music, this one is very good and entertaining. The dancing of the fairies and flowers and mushrooms make for a heck of a good time for the whole family.<br /><br />The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas = This is probably the most exciting rendition of Dukas's masterpiece I've ever heard (even though a few minutes of music has been cut out of it). Mickey the apprentice dreams of being a powerful sorcerer, so he dons the hat of his master, and lets loose his magic. But, of course, no one controls literally everything that is created . . .<br /><br />Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring) by Igor Stravinsky = This is my 3rd favorite out of all of them for two reasons. One is that Stravinsky is one of my all-time favorite composers, and two, The Rite of Spring is one of my all-time favorite pieces. Too bad that a mere ten minutes has been cut in order to save time. Dinosaurs, volcanoes, and earthquakes do seem to fit Stravinsky's music a bit, that I can tell you.<br /><br />Symphony No. 6 \\"Pastoral\\" by Ludwig van Beethoven = This is probably the weakest of all the sequences. It's too cartoony, too bombastic, too cheery, and to many minutes of music have been cut out sadly. The storm scene is a nice touch, though.<br /><br />Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli = Gorgeous and downright hilarious. If you don't think hippo and ostrich ballet dancers is funny, then something is wrong with you.<br /><br />A Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky/Ave Maria by Franz Schubert = Ah yes. My No. 1 favorite out of all of them. This didn't scare me as a kid for some reason. Chernobog is as creepy as The Horned King from \\"The Black Cauldron\\", and the demonic and ghostly dancing was (and still is) way ahead of its time. The last five minutes is beautiful and ethereal = they don't make them like they used to.<br /><br />Grade: Aes. My No. 1 favorite out of all of them. This didn't scare me as a kid for some reason.

B000X5SPBI|4.0|please, don´t understand me wrong, because this show is one of my favorites, but paying the full price nearly half a fulltime show isn´t acceptable.  the third season hasn´t that great stories as season 1 or 2, hasn´t so much mystery in it or the mystery is artificial, but it is much more brutal.  the reason may be the strike of the writers, but still isn´t acceptable to pay the full price for half the product, isn´t it? (and this show isn´t the only one. shame on you, producers!)    there are some nice new details like a friedly demon (but we still don´t know what goal she (sexy demon) has). and that the escaped demons search for a new leader.    the acting is still great and keeps the show way above average.    but, i am curios, if next year the producers will give us a season with 30 epsiodes for the normal price to get us even?  or do they finally found out to rip us even more and the show will have only 15, 14 or even less episodes?    so, if i find out, that the show will have lesser episodes, i will wait until the price is fair.
B000X418UE|4.0|This is a great story of personal redemption, laced with awesome action sequences and spectacular sound. The angles and editing are fantastic, and the \\"crisis\\" of consciousness that the characters face, along with the humurous sub plot of Nick Cage's character all blend for a fun, entertaining action movie.
1592402690|5.0|This was a thoroughly fascinating look at the working life of The Beatles  at the Abbey Road recording studio. It gives an interesting and detailed   first-hand account of their ideas and execution in the studio, as well  as their personalities, and how they interacted. The book also provides  a great background on the tremendous social and economic changes in   Britain in the 1960s. What was it like for a mere teenager to get a job  working as an assistant engineer at Abbey Road? What was it like to  rise through the ranks of recording professionals and work with The  Beatles as they took the world by storm? This book answers those questions,   and many others, in a charming and engaging manner.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Like any TV series, Dexter has its problems and flaws. However, Season 1's unique style and interesting characters (I cannot think of a better word. Interesting is an understatement) pulled me in for Season 2. What does Season 2 do better than Season 1? Suspense! If you liked Season 1, you will finish watching Season 2 in 1-2 days.  My girlfriend and I tried to stretch out the episodes, but each was more suspenseful than the previous.  I give Dexter Season 2 4/5 stars because it still has its problems. Dexter's father/son relationship is still forced and unbelievable, and Deb's new relationship is awkward. Also some of the writing and situations seem too convenient.  Please do not misconstrue my criticisms. The show is wonderful and I am looking forward to Season 3.
B0000667RO|5.0|I love the 80's and 90's music and Bryan Adams is in that era, if I remember right.  Anyways, this is a great CD.
1401216676|3.0|this was recommended to me after seeing the dark knight. the story is somewhat exciting, but not incredibly compelling. The artwork is great however.
B000000OF6|5.0|Love Queen. When I was in high school, our them song was Another One Bites the Dust and it takes me back every time I listen to it.  Great CD
B00132D808|5.0|You can tell these guys actually know what they're doing in their music.  I love how in their 4th song they find use for a tritone and it actually sounds awesome.  I don't own their first cd cause it always seemed like it was just the \\"popular\\" kind of music, but my friend showed me this cd and I bought it the next day.  The closest band I could probably relate this to is the Beatles, but it's all original music!  I listen to all types of music except country and I've been listening to this cd a lot!
B000001EHS|5.0|I love Def Leppard, the music, the songs, the words to the songs, I just love it.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|\\"Half Nelson\\" is not a pleasant film.  It spoke to me of the imperfection of all human beings, no matter what color, gender or age.  We see the young teacher Dan Dunne who is handsome and a dedicated teacher in a poor school.  However, his personal life has fallen apart with his drug use.  In the hands of another actor, the film would have been harder to watch.  Ryan Gosling was nominated for Best Actor for the film and won the honor for his Breakthrough Performance from the National Board of Review.  He is befriended by his student Drey who seems to idolize her teacher, but then finds him smoking crack cocaine.  Drey is played by Shareeka Epps who was also in the film short.  She won Best Supporting Actress awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Society.  It is a sensitive portrayal.  Then Drey starts dealing; and we see her imperfection.  Tina Holmes plays Rachel in the film and finds it hard to be with Dan.  We see Dan's family, Drey's family, and many of the students in the school.  Each is a product of their circumstances and their choices.  I thought the film ended on a positive note as Dunne shaves his scraggly beard.  Perhaps he has hit bottom and will start to pull himself together.  The film was named Best Picture by the American Film Institute.  It is difficult to watch in spots.  It speaks to the frailty and magnificence that lie side by side in each of us.  Enjoy!
0143038419|1.0|It's difficult to imagine that this book is a bestseller. After about 50 pages I was bored with her ramblings and unimportant self-focus. Geez. This is what sells in the US these days? I guess it tells us something about our consciousness and level of sophistication around literature. (This book is NOT literature.)
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie and I watch it often. I bought the video when it came out in the 90's and now I have trouble watching it on our new HD TV, so   now I purchased it in the DVD form. The actors were great in this movie.  I can't get enough of the movie.
032147404X|5.0|I read the book not once but twice and found Scott's presentations very short and concise. Each page of the book has an item of interest with a very informative narration. I would recommend this book to anyone starting the love of photography.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Wow! What a GREAT Movie! I saw Spider-Man 3 many times at the Cinema and now I can watch it to my own pleasure at the comfprt of my home. A SOLID Superhero Movie with a great story, great Acting and amazing special effects. I highly recommend this movie to any fan of the character and of the general Superhero movie genre. Action, Inspiration and philosophy are all included in this highly entertaining Movie. Go watch it!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I already did this review but since you're asking again.... This 'item' gets an excellent rating. The condition of the DVD was fine. But I was very  disappointed in the time it took for delivery. Because it was a birthday gift I used the more expensive shipping & handling but it took longer to get it than when I use the standard. It was received several days after the special day had gone by. Guess I'll continue to use the standard S&H.
0790729350|4.0|I'm a nostalgic semi-old rocker who would have love to be there during that era. So that movie is kind of a must for me, since I have a quite extensive collection of rock concert videos. Like everyone, I saw that movie in somekind of form, on TV or during nostalgia trips at Much Music (Canada's MTV). This version of Woodstock -the movie differs from the one we all saw in a few ways: First, and I quite can't explaine why, It does not follow the chronological order of the festival. Exemple: Richie Haven's performance, which opened the festival, is in the middle of the second DVD. Same for Country Joe McDonald... Also, it is hard to know exactly what happened. Did it rain once? Twice? But, apart from those historical questions, there is also a few benefits: The audio is far better than the cheesy and thin sound that we all remember from the original movie. Everything sound clear and true, with some kind of treatment that give almost the impression of \\"being there\\"...some kind of reverb and stereo spatialization. Ther is also bonus performance; 2 form Jefferson's Airplane, one from Country Joe McDonald and the Fish, and one from Jimi Hendrix that include a great unaccompanied guitar jam...   Anather point: I'm not crazy about the double-faced DVD. Mine arrived loose in its box, and was quite scratched. Still works though. Last: One can't watch those scenes about hippies and the \\"peance and love\\" generation and it's confrontation with the \\"straight\\" word without a smile and somekind of amazement...    Pierre

B0009JAENU|4.0|Mozart's Violin Sonatas of Hahn is too clean instead of the unpleasantness of Anne-Sophie Mutter, and there is no fault but no fun in Hahn's Mozart. I think that it is not more than the average point, though played well in K. 304 and with a rise in K. 526. It is easier to listen more than Szeryng and Haebler, but it doesn't reach far from Mark Steinberg & Mitsuko Uchida [[ASIN:B0007KTAXQ Mozart: Sonatas for Piano & Violin in F Major, K. 377; C Major, K. 303; E Minor, K. 304; A Major, K. 526]] in interest.<br /><br />Natalie Zhu is good.<br /><br />Recorded in 2004.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|This record is a solid piece of work that is something I absolutely enjoyed from the begining to the end.  Even though it's not \\"ground breaking\\" I feel it is something I will listen to for a long time to come.  I see that some people are giving this bad reviews who claim to be \\"old kings\\" fans.  I am a person who likes both, and all I have to say to these people is to get over it.  They are not going to put out the same album over and over again.
0385340990|5.0|There aren't enough words to describe the way I felt after putting this book down. Without any doubt in mind, this is the best book published this year and I wouldn't be surprised to see it turn into a movie very soon. The novel is about a young reporter who has lived through the second World War and is searching for inspiration to write. She isn't sure what uplifting pieces she's supposed to write given the times, but when a man mails her a letter from the small island of Guernsey, her life changes. The man is part of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society on the island, and instantly the reporter is intrigued. Thus begins a series of letters that are so touching, so realistic, you will think you stepped back in time.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|While this is ostensibly about the Russian Revolution, it is really about unbounded youthful enthusiasm and the ultimate brick wall it hits when experience sets in.  Ignorance, youth and over-confidence are a lethal combination.  Made shortly after the similar youthful outburts of the 1960s, the movie could easily have used that backdrop for the same purpose.    The revolution began with high hopes and sank into an Orwellian slough, just as many of the 1960s visionaries became the conservative suburbanites of the following decades.  The supposed father of the Russian Revolution was Karl Marx, but in short order all that remained of him was his poster picture--because his ideals, as John Reed and Louise Bryant would discover, were impossible, e.g., the abolition of all private property.    Reed died early, before the purges, before the advent of Stalin--who would probably have killed Reed.  Bryant lived on, married a U.S. ambassador and lived in Paris, where her scandalous behavior was of a different sort.  The movie doesn't go into all that, any more than \\"Hair\\" went into the rise of Ronald Reagan.    The acting in this movie is superb, flawless.  The use of witnesses is especually effective, although I wish they had been labeled.  I recognized some but not all of them.    This is a movie that has stayed with me since I first saw it more than 25 years ago.  It felt just as fresh upon seeing it again yesterday.

031606792X|5.0|I read the entire series in about a week. My 17-y-o son asked me to read the books because he and his girlfriend were. We share a similar taste in literature and have read many series together over the years, this may be our favorite.    After tearing through the books at break neck speed, I found myself a little depressed and let down that the series was completed. Not in the way the series was completed, but sad that there was not more. I took to the Internet to search for more and was astounded to find some fairly hateful and hideous reviews of this book. I cannot understand why.    I loved the books from start to finish. I loved the opportunity to bond with my son over them. I loved the fact that I could read a fairly complex, compelling and titillating  love story and not have to blush or feel uncomfortable knowing he was reading the same lines.     The book may not have turned out exactly as I would have liked in some of the story lines, but I do not understand the ire its conclusion has drawn. These are Ms. Meyer's characters and its her story. I wouldn't dream of demanding she re-write it anymore than I would demand a re-write from Tolkein or Austen or any other author. Its simply not my right to do so.    And for those that state that Bella is in an abusive relationship and this may influence young girls to seek this... PLEASE tell me that you are not personally relying on a fantasy book series to be a moral compass for your child. Really- its a book- its a story. As such, it has opened up a wide range of discussion topics for my son and me. It has given me the opportunity to dialogue with him, not be a substitute for my own parenting.    I would like to congratulate and thank Stephenie Meyer for her beautiful and magical series. Her rise to fame has been a fairy tale of its own. I hope she can bar the door and refuse to receive any more poisoned apples from her so called fans.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If you're expecting high brow cinema from this flick, you outta have your head examined! Of course it's crude and vulgar! Of course it's out of bounds! That's the whole point, silly! It's like getting offended at a Don Rickles show!<br /><br />Personally, I loved it! The \\"America, f*=@# yeah\\" gung-ho anthem is a riot. So is the \\"I'm so ronery\\" bit, the towel turbaned guy, the puppet sex scene (make sure you get the unrated edition) and the F.A.G. jokes. Tasteless? Sure. Dead on target? Hillariously so. Politically inccorrect? Thank God, yes! Is that why so many of you are upset? I thought so...<br /><br />MAAAAAAATT DAAAAAMON!!! (he, he, he!) Get a life!
0930289234|5.0|This is the only graphic novel that actually lives up to the term.  If you have never read it, you should.
0525948023|5.0|A remarkable book that is capable of changing lives through changing consciousness. If more people read this book and BE, it really will be \\"A New Earth\\".  I have found this book comprehensive in its drawing together of so many issues that plague humanity and giving clear guidance as to what to do (or not do) to get in touch with what is always there - our true inner essence. As a psychologist working with many people struggling with thoughts and emotions, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone wishing to experience inner peace.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Just got my season 2 and I love it! the box is small beautiful & elegant the new visual effects are very nice I think Star Trek needed the face left so that newer generation can actually watch it and understand its value this is a premium product and a must have for Star Trek fans and collectors the only down side is that I was expecting it to released in Blu-ray since season 1 was available on HD which unfortunately is gone anyhow DVD is good enough for me all in all excellent product that I highly recommend.
B000059H98|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time.... you know that is if you like low budget b movies. overall, it's funny and it is great for a collector like me.
1563898586|5.0|Lighter in weight and tone than From Hell or Watchmen, League appears on the surface to be more rompy fan fiction than reinventing the comic. It was while reading the net's wiki 'Notes on League of Gentlemen' that I began to appreciate each panel's detail and 'mass culture references', to quote TMBG. Three words - a friggin' joy. Now, if I could just summon the moxy to delve into 'Lost Girls'.
B00005JPS8|5.0|this movie was one hundred percent awesome I absolutely loved this movie the action was very good and I loved this movie Robert Downey JR gives an excellent performance as Tony Stark aka IronMan this has to be one of the greatest action movies since some of Robert Downey JR's other movies and I'm not insulting the guy at all I really enjoyed this movie the action in this movie was very good and I liked every second of it
B000VXLC3K|2.0|I received my item in good time and in good shape.  But the two CD set turned out to be the same CD twice.  I was very disappointed.
0783225733|5.0|Okay, for you technophiles, Universal did a good job in the transfer to DVD.  The colors are vivid and the picture is razor sharp.  Sound quality is great and the overall experience is worth the price of admission.  Save your money and buy the single disc set.  The second disc is an edited IMAX version and the \\"extras\\" on the second disc are so so.  All of the \\"good\\" extras are on the single disc version.    Now for the REAL story.  Plain and simple, these guys were heroes in every sense of the word.  They risked their lives for what they believed in, without heavenly financial compensation (they got their regular pay, plus flight pay, plus hazardous duty pay)  In today's dollars that about $300 flight pay and $125 a month to risk your life.  Many of the men in this program had families.    Truly a contrast to today's heroes (Sports Figures) who act like spoiled brats and cry if they get a hang-nail.  All this, while collecting a salary the would support 100 families in the US.  I'd like to see any of today's heroes maintain their composure while everything around them is failing. If you lose a ball game, there is always next year.  If you \\"lose\\" in space, you're dead.    I grew up in the 60's with the space program and this film is a true testiment to the courage, skill, dedication, and selflessness of the entire NASA team.    Kind of a interesting closing point.  Take note when Tom Hanks (Comm. Jim Lovell) is on the carrier deck after splash down/pick-up.  He shakes the hand of a Navy Captain (left side of frame).  That is THE Jim Lovell (Captain, USN Retired) and he is wearing HIS original Navy uniform, still fits him after all these years.  Nice touch on the part of Director Ron Howard and great tribute film to the men who gave their all for their country and each other.
0439023483|5.0|From the best-selling author of Gregor the Overlander and the Underland Chronicles. With the Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins has outdone herself. This book was awesome!
6305718954|4.0|I give STIGMATA 4 stars for the quality of the acting.  The film itself could have been so much more than it is.  All the ingredients are there.  For those who want to automatically call it an EXORCIST rip off, it certainly is not.  The story is very different and fully based on the presence of the stigmata.<br /><br />The story is original, believable and much effort is put into the special effects.  But the script does not totally flow and the scares and suspense just aren't really there.  Maybe it is overproduced.  Again, the acting is superb.  patricia Arquette has an acting tour de force as Frankie, the young woman who is stricken by the stigmata as is Gabriel Byrne as Father Kiernan the investigative priest sent to study her.  They also play very well off each other.  Also, each scene in which she is stricken by another sign of the stigmata is very efefectively shown.<br /><br />But all the other pieces just don't mesh.  I think the producers and writers took on too much and didn't give the movie and storyline the dedication it deserved.  It is certainly not a bad movie and has some of the best acting you will ever see.  But Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne are certainly let down by the material they are given.  They carry it as best they can.<br /><br />Had this film been handled more carefully it could have become a very important, popular film with a message that put it in the same genre as THE EXORCIST but kept it a standout film in its own right.  People see the clips etc. and think its just another film about a possessed girl.  This is so not true and sadly the opportunity to tell the story well is wasted as is the excellent acting.  But believe me, allow yourself to watch it just for that - the acting -  and Patricia Arquette in particular will blow you away.
0596522347|4.0|This is a great book that I would give 4.5 stars if I could. I'm a Marketing VP, I bought it to help clean up our text-heavy, no-white-space slides. Now the Sales VP is studying it, and have you ever seen a sales guy study anything?<br /><br />The best part of the book is it's step-by-step exploration of the whole presentation process, from creating ideas, through diagrams, images, colors, templates, etc. Most other resources focus only on the slides, which is just the visible end product of the whole process. This book does not slack on the slides either, with lots of color examples.<br /><br />Why not five stars? After studying the book for a few days, I realized that there could have been a much wider variety of presentation samples. There is a bit of sameness to the examples shown. An example of a software product presentation, and of a consumer sales presentation, would have added great variety. In fact, one spread is devoted to an Audience Definition exercise, with a very detailed profile of the \\"empty nester\\" audience for a presentation about investments or timeshares. While the exercise was very well done, if we could have seen the resulting presentation, it would have gone a long way to getting this book its extra half star.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this book is worth buying and reading. Buy copies for your staff. Maybe the expanded second edition will have a few more examples.
0385751532|5.0|I liked this book alot.  I can't really describe it that well without giving it away but it's very good.  It's well written and I like the approach John Boyne used on the subject.<br />This book is also being turned into a movie coming out in the US in November 2008.  So if you like reading books and then watching the movie that goes with it....<br />But very powerful and just very good.<br /><br />PS, its also sad
B0019T9FL6|2.0|I am an avid admirer of J-Hud, for her singing and acting. And she represents the Chi(cago) well!! But if I'm  going to be honest, and getting pass the hype: THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!  It has nothing to do with J-Hud's voice, yet everything to do with it. Jennifer Hudson has a more traditional soul/gospel singing voice that is in the vein of a Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight or recent divas such as Ledisi, Conya Doss and Lela Hathaway. Or even Angie Stone. Having won an Oscar, J-Hud should have asked for and demanded more creative control. But it doesn't seem like she did here. What we have here are songs with Ludicris and (CRINGE!!) T-PAIN singing background on the tracks. Come on! That's not Jennifer Hudson. Quit forcing diamond-shape artists into square holes. The music should've been more organic too and not so canned. I would rather J-Hud do an all gospel album if they were going to take her away from the soulful r&b side of her voice. She's a soul artist, not a hip-hop pop artist!!    This album sucks!! But I still love you J-Hud, bad decisions and all.

I wasn't real thrilled with Rocky III, But being a Stallone fan, I had to have them all.  I watch it alot and probally at some point will need a new one.    It was one of the best purchases I have ever made.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a wonderful series with dramatic footage.  The whole family will enjoy this collection.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|This is mainly a reply to all the 1 star reviews which don't take anything into account other than the inaccuracy in how this relates to The Iliad.  I'm sorry that they might have raped your image from The Iliad, but this isn't a movie called The Iliad, it's called Troy.  In the Iliad the siege took 9 years, does anyone actually expect something like that ever to be put to film?  There is so much that would not translate well to film, I don't have a problem with other character changes they made.    Get real, this is a 'fun' movie.  It wasn't made to piss you off, giving something a 1 star review based soley on how it was not completely accurate to something is ridiculous.  Pull up $300 million of your own money and make it how it how it was in The Iliad and see you recoup 1% of your production cost.
1596680296|5.0|I haven't yet made anything from this book yet, however I've referred to it & really liked what I've seen as I've browsed through the pages.  I bought it at the same time that I bought Knitting Circles Around Socks: Knit Two at a Time on Circular Needles by Antje Gillingham.  I have knit a few things on dpns & was more motivated to knit my first pair of socks two at a time on circular needles, so started with Antje Gillingham's book first.  I did need to refer to Ann Budd's Getting Started Knitting Socks, however, when the usually thorough Gillingham neglected to include directions for picking up stitches in her book.  I was very please to find directions in Budd's book with descriptions of a few different ways to do this.  So I was able to complete my project from Gillingham's book with a little help from Budd.  Knitting two socks at a time fits my personality better, but Gillingham includes directions on how to convert any pattern using dpns to the two at a time circular needle method, so I'm excited to try some of the patterns in Budd's getting started book.  She includes a lot more pattern variety than Gillingham.  Budd also includes a variety of stitch options for knitting heel flaps in her book, so you can adjust whatever pattern you're working on to your aesthetic preference.  While I truly am a big fan of Gillingham's book, she's very clear with direction, there is a lot more information & variety in Budd's book in general & I am excited to learn more from it & try out some of her patterns.  I would highly recommend it.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|Cute movie. Tom Hanks should be in more animated movies. My niece loves it. :)
B000BTC5LW|5.0|i saw this concert live and i had to have it, thank you. good price and delivery
B000PFU9GA|5.0|I am a late bloomer. I was not able to catch the series on TV. But purchased all the seasons after running into a few afternoon repeats. And I loved it so much I bought a set for my mom. We laughed and talked about the episode's after and we cried and remembered just how hard it was to be a kid and a parent back when I went threw some of that high school junk as a kid. Love the charecters. Can't say enough about the series.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a great version of the well known story.  The movie is enchanting and takes you to another world.  Love to stick this movie in while working around the house.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Seriously you have no taste in music if this album doesn't get 5 stars. I am a metalhead at heart like most people here but its nice to chill out, listen to some indie hip hop, like Aesop Rock, Prolyphic once in a while, some classic rock like Tom Petty and Steve Miller, nothing wrong with raising the horns to Opeth or Between the Buried and Me. But one of all time favorites, Clutch put out one of the best rock albums I've ever heard with this. I'll recommend this album to anyone!! Get it NOW.      Seriously STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND SUPPORT THIS INCREDIBLE BAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Started with the 1st session and loved it, so does my husband.  By the 7th & final season things are alittle more complicated but still very good.  Highly recommended, full of laughs, alone with heart-breaking sad times.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|If you own a PS3 just wait a few minutes and disc 1 will start playing.  The special features are very cool.  I always love seeing behind-the-scenes special FX work.    As for the movie, it's probably the best superhero movie ever.  IMO, only Batman Begins rivals it.  I guess rich billionaire playboys just make better superheros.  This movie isn't very violent, so I don't think parents should worry too much.  There are maybe one or two scenes that are sexually suggestive, but nothing worse than you might find on network TV.  It is easily my favorite movie of '08 and I can't wait for the sequel.  Remember to wait 'til the end of the credits for a surprise!
0143038419|2.0|Reading this book is like reading someone's private journal - too much self-absorbed thought.  I found it hard to relate to someone who disdained both marriage and children, had the financial resources to spend a full year traveling and indulging, and who has no commitment to other human beings - or at least as we're told. Personally I'm amazed she couldn't find God in Italy - the home of the Catholic church, and I got lost in the ashram, but eventually finished it, more out of curiousity than because it held my attention.    There are some redeeming qualities towards the end that encourages us to re-evaluate our lives, sort of a stop, look and listen reminder.  But all in all, I have yet to figure out the allure of Oprah and all the other outstanding reviews.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I ordered DVD based on review in major weekly magazine...i am not thin-skinned, overly sensitive, or prudish but i could not make it even half way thru this movie.      Movie contains graphic scenes of extremely deviant sexual behavior and abuse.
0385338082|5.0|Loved this book and totally fell in love with the heroine- Emma!  She reminded me of Bridget Jones - the forever fumbling, tripping career girl who at heart is sweet and just wants a happy ending. A couple of hilarious moments include the Family day picnic where Connor tries to guess who Emma is going out with, Jemima's parroting of lessons she learnt from her Mummy on men (esp the crack about the Pope having had plastic surgery!) and Lissy freaking out thinking Emma's a lesbian.   I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, fun read.
0743496736|5.0|I've known Jodi Picoult since i read \\"The sister's keeper\\". So I've become a fan of her.  Be honest, I'm reading this book \\"Nineteen minutes\\", not finished but I couldn't put down this book. It makes me shocking when I'm reading, maybe it tells us it's a true story, would be happen in some countries also, and in fact some couples are ready to be parents, i think must read this book first. Maybe learn more from this book. Your kids are \\"YOU\\".  Comment of this book: Must own! Must read! Excellent!
B00009ATIX|5.0|S. Soderbergh's Solaris can barely be called an adaptation of S. Lem's novel, nor can it accurately be called a remake of the 1972 Russian film. However, when viewed without prejudice it is a fantastic film stylistically, as well as in terms of story and character development.<br /><br />Soderbergh ignores the technical and scientific aspects of Lem's novel and focuses on the human story instead. From the books limited material on the subject he extrapolates the tumultuous love story at the heart of his film. Unfortunately, that means that 'liquid metal' oceans of the novel are left out as well.<br /><br />In this film the planet Solaris itself plays second fiddle to Clooney's space-faring psychologist, and the question of the planet's possible sentience is overshadowed by the question of what it actually means to be human. The material is still absorbing and adeptly handled, but this reflects Sodenbergh's philosophies, and not necessarily Lem's.<br /><br />The film pays homage to Kubrick's 2001 by painstakingly recreating his style (some critics may prefer the term plagiarized) including the pervasive atmospheric soundtrack and long periods of silence. This film will not please Sci-Fi action seekers, nor will it please those looking for a faithful adaptation of Lem's text. I'm a huge fan of the book and Solaris is one of my favorite films, so it is possible to enjoy both in their own right.<br /><br />DVD comes with making-of featurettes and can be played in both widescreen and fullscreen modes. Dolby Digital capable systems will reveal the full glory of the mesmerizing soundtrack.
B001FB62GY|5.0|I am sure that Naomi Klein would not imagine ever being lumped in with Ronald Reagan, but remembering Reagan, having read Shock Doctrine and watching what is happening right now -- October 1, 2008 -- with the U.S. Congress' attempt to bail out the American financial sector of its excesses, I think one of Reagan's famous quotes is applicable: \\"They're you go again!\\"
B0013FXWU6|3.0|There Will Be Blood is another one of those movies that you will either love or hate.  Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic in this extensive character study; the acting in general was superb.  But the pacing was very peculiar--long passages occur when nothing much happens; and the music was overwhelming more than a few times, literally covering the dialogue.  I am a composer myself, and I appreciated the composer's skill, but I think the sound engineer should never work in Hollywood again.  All in all, the reviewer below who described this as an \\"Oily Citizen Kane\\" was pretty close to the mark, although this movie was more violent.  All in all, I was left with too much of a sense that the director was trying too hard to create a film that would last for all time.  To my mind, a somewhat more direct method would have made a better film.  But perhaps it's me.

B0010ZR160|4.0|Ben Affleck continues his return to respectability with his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone.  Exploring an area he knows quite well, South Boston, Mr. Affleck elicits strong performances from a first rate cast including his brother Casey in the lead role, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan & Titus Welliver.  The movie revolves around a missing child search that turns into a kidnapping plot involving police corruption.  There is a dark edge to the film with a mix of salty and earthy South Boston characters that add even more gruffness.  Although this film didn't receive the Academy Award recognition of another Dennis Lehane adaptation, Mystic River, I found Gone Baby Gone less pretentious and overacted and ultimately more enjoyable.
B001GY7SBI|5.0|Prison Break is my second favorite show after 24. I like having the option to watch the episodes on my computer when I'm unable to watch it on TV.  The color and sound is very good.
0439023483|4.0|An easy read and a true page turner. I don't usually like apocalyptic stories but this one was recommended on Stephenie Meyer's website so I thought I'd give it a try. It was an easy enough read that I finished it in less than a day.<br /><br />The ending was left wide open for a sequel so I felt the story wasn't ended properly. It did leave me wanting to read the next book in the series, but I was a little put off that I'll have to wait another year or so before I know what happens with these characters. I also get the feeling I was being set up for something more, but I'll never know what really happens until the series is officially over.<br /><br />Reading this book made me feel like I'd just eaten a nice meal and purposely saved room for dessert, but got a rice cake and a promise for more instead.
B001CISHU4|5.0|First off, I'm not a death metal aficionado.  If you have read my review on \\"With Oden on Our Side\\" you'll know that Amon Amarth was my first real purchase in the Death Metal genre.  I was attracted to them because the music in the snippets I'd heard was just the kind of thing I like.  Aggressive, rough even, but beautifully melodic.  It helped that Johan Hegg's vocals are incredibly easy to understand as he enunciates his growls and sings very rhythmically.    I'd read some of the early reviews on Metal sites about this CD, and snapped it up.  While \\"With Oden on Our Side\\" had a few songs which really stuck out for me, and a couple which later elevated themselves on further listenings, \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" strikes me as an even more consistently melodic CD.  The music is never pushed to the background by the vocals and usually takes the forefront.  I'm listening to it yet again right now, and am reminded that there are even some guitar solos which wouldn't be out of place on traditional heavy metal or power metal CDs.    One other thing I really like about the music is that it's heavy and textured.  Some other melodic death metal that I thought I might like left me a bit cold, and it was usually a combination of the singer being too dominant and the music sounding a bit thin.  There's definitely a strong bass element here which works very nicely.    While the songs rarely tend to be extremely fast (most would fall squarely into 'mid tempo' with a couple of faster songs), different emphasis on drums or guitars make most of them feel unique.  I really don't have any favorites yet, but overall I like it significantly more than their previous effort.    The special edition has a bonus DVD with some live performances that rounds out an already great package.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've lost 5lbs so far after doing this DVD only 5 times in 7 days! I started doing the first Level for 4 days. I got stronger quickly so I advanced to Level 2 the 5 time. I have to say I like the moves on Level 1 better. Level 2's moves are a bit more awkward. I'm sure they will get easier once I get stronger though. Be prepared to be super sore the first time ever doing this. I worked out with weights and resistants bands prior to this dvd but I was still really sore. It helped to put a different workout in between the days I was sore and then get right back into the next day! She is really encouraging throughout the dvd which kept me going on some parts I wanted to die! If you do this dvd with the intensity she wants you to for the full 20 minutes you will be sweating like crazy! I also liked that she had two girls behind her doing different levels. There was some moves I just couldn't do yet on level 2 so it was nice to see what my option was by looking at the less advanced moves. I definitely recommend this DVD!
1596680296|5.0|This book IS for beginners.  It has excellent photos and figures, with clear, precise instructions.  It also has side-bars pointing out potential pitfalls and how to deal with them.  It gives a choice of methods, leaving the beginner free to explore what works best for him or her.  If you're an advanced sock knitter, I personally probably wouldn't spend the money, since any issues you might be having can be researched on the internet for free.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Let me just say, this works JUST FINE on my PS3. Not a long load time, maybe a minute for the disc. Then after, VERY fast.<br /><br />Iron Man the movie, is a fun ride. I really liked re-watching it again on Blu Ray. It looks and sounds AMAZING.<br /><br />The 2nd disc is FULL of hours of making of features. This is how DVD special features should be made. I was very impressed and I buy all my DVD's in 2 disc just for special features and Iron Man doesn't disappoint.
B001E75QH0|4.0|I can only hope that this is the last adventure Indian Jones will be on. The biggest thing I've noticed about this movie is that I can really see Harrison Ford had a hell of a time making this picture.<br />This film is much better than I anticipated.
B000VWGYHU|5.0|Okay! lets face it there are many artist in the game right now that RAP but EMINEM, EMINEM is a beast he is the definition of hip hop I listened to this album consistantly up to today and I'm still hooked.  Great album! Stan is considerabley the greatest track on this album but musically and lyricaly EMEINEM raises the bar on the entire album for the standard of Hip Hop.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I was very surprised that the overall opinion on this album was so negative. Because this is, not only the best Tool album ([[ASIN:B00005B36H Lateralus]] is very close, I admit), it is also one of the best albums I've ever heard, hands down - and one of the albums I've heard the most times in my life. So many times I know every passage, every awesome bass chop, every drum fill down to the last detail (well, almost) - and yet I still haven't tired of it! If anything, it keeps getting better.    I suppose I, on an objective level, can see why some of you might feel disappointed - it is a slow-moving, long, dragged-out affair as opposed to especially [[ASIN:B000000993 Undertow]] and [[ASIN:B00000099Y Aenima]], but it's also incredibly fresh and instantly intruguing in many cases. At least I was instantly awe-inspired by the guitar intro to \\"Jambi\\", the new-found highly political aspect to the lyrics on \\"Vicarious\\" (and later I discovered, to most of the album), the godlike basslines of \\"The Pot\\" as well as the unusual, awesome, high-pitched vocal perfomance.   These all rank among the very best Tool pieces, along with the melancholic, existential album closer \\"Right in Two\\".    The more indigestible, and not as instantly compelling parts would include \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" - which can be a little hard to take in at first. And it is the piece on the album that seems most out of place. It sounds like 3 or 4 songs rolled (smashed) into one, alternating between frantic ranting and soft vocals. Sometimes it actually sounds like Tool's style around the first album, sometimes it sounds more like nothing else they've ever recorded. But as with everything here it really grows on you, becoming a neatly-woven mesh of awesome riffs and evil, really evil drumming and bass-playing -  ending up utterly enjoyable.  The \\"Wings for Marie\\"/\\"10,000 Days\\"-\\"saga\\" as well, can probably also be justified as being a little \\"inaccessible\\". And it certainly is long, and certainly takes some twenty more or less focused listens to fully appreciate, but certainly also is the most rewarding song here. It is so sad and spiritual it really moves me in a way Tool has never done before. It concerns Keenan's mother who was in a wheelchair for, well... 10,000 days eventually passing away, which in itself is heart-breaking; but the beauty lies in the way it's mediated. Epically, so beautifully it slowly builds up and evolves from - both literally and symbolically - rain to thunderstorm; echoing guitars, eerie cymbal/percussion work, the bass serving as the main rhythmic factor until it escalates into something with a more regular chorus-like feeling. Then it breaks apart, rips up and nearly spins out of control, and then is eventually gathered in utter melancholic tranquility. Truly the most epic Tool song ever I'd say - and a soulful, worthy goodbye from Maynard to his mother.     As demonstrated in the previously mentioned two-parter, this is, in comparison with earlier works, very much bassist Justin Chancellor's album. He seems to have really grown into a more prominent musical figure within the band, demonstrating his amazing skill and creativity throughout the album (and he is _just_ as awesome live!), but especially on \\"Wings\\"/\\"10,000 Days\\" and \\"The Pot\\", both of which rank among the best metal-bass performances ever for me.     The only negative statement I can remotely relate to, is the amount of \\"filler\\" this album has. \\"Lipan Conjuring\\", \\"Lost Keys\\", \\"Intension\\" (more or less) and \\"Viginity Tres\\" all don't sound quite as memorable or \\"complete\\" as everything else here.  But the way I have come to look at it, the album consists of the 7 \\"real\\" songs, which would actually be adequate to make up the best Tool album on their own because of the sheer quality they possess in terms of songwriting and musical craftmanship and thoroughness - with these shorter pieces serving merely as ambient interludes between them. '10,000 Days' seems like it is very much an album that is intended for listening to from beginning to end - as one coherent experience; and for those who have the time, there is something truly extraordinary in store. An incredibly spiritual, moving, impressive and complex album.    Tool continues to get better with each passing release - at least in my opinion.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie turned out to be a sleeper! It started out slow and I wandered if I hadn't made a mistake. As the movie continued I started laughing and didn't stop till the end. The ending also touched my heart for the underdogs of this world. You didn't know whether to cry or laugh. This is why I purchased this movie. I own very few dvd's. Another good movie I highly recommend is \\"Secondhand Lions\\" with Robert Duvall and Michael Caine. This movie is also like \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" in that it will make you laugh and cry.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Despite the decent special effects and the comparative newness of the film being shown from the viewpoint of a hand held video camera this essentially just an old-fashioned monster movie. For me it only just merits 3 stars and heres why:<br /><br />Good points:<br />The held held camera view was very effective in places and did give you a sense of the panic that can occur in disaster situations. The acting was decent and as already mentioned the special effects were well done.<br /><br />Bad points:<br />The opening party sequence went on too long. All it was trying to tell us was that a couple had split up and that could have been done much quicker. After 10 minutes had gone by, in what is a short movie, I was beginning to wonder if I was watching the right film...<br />I accept that you have to suspend disbelief when watching films like this, but this had so many occasions when what happened lacked any credibility in reality (I'm talking about the Helicopter crash and the girl who was impaled on the steel pole to name two examples). I also got fed up with hearing people saying \\"oh my God\\" every 30 seconds. The hand-held camera use needed to be broken up. 84 mins was too long for a wobbly picture....<br /><br />Having said all that it is worth seeing, as after the slow start its certainly an entertaining rollercoaster ride. But like I said at the start this is essentially a B Movie/Monster Movie, if you expect nothing else than you'll probably enjoy a fun movie. Expect any more and you might be disappointed
B0019T9FL6|3.0|I went out like a little teenager to buy this CD as soon as it came out.  I would've paid regular price for this CD but lucky for me someone had already made the decision of paying less and maybe for a reason.  I love Jennifer Hudson but c'mon.  These songs could've been better written and such a fabulous voice even the arrangement for the familiar \\"And I am telling you\\" was off lacked emotion.  I mean, I liked her cover song...of course.  But, the song with Ludacris and the song with Tpain.  My God, what a waste of studio time.  Even the song with Fantasia is a little teenie bopper dumb for such a gorgeous voice and style of a singer.  I mean, c'mon people.  Why can't well written songs be available for the Diva?  I know putting an album together full of good songs is hard but at least make an 1st entrance with being proud of this material.  I don't think Jennifer's 1st album will last once the real music reviewers get a hold of it.  You just wait.  I mean, it's going to go next to Fantasia's albums and Jennifer is going to look back at her dream going down the tubes.  I won't say this album is a total waste because song #2 and the very last song is very good so I guess in total there's about 4 songs that are good.  I'm sad for this release because I thought enough time had gone into it since it took so much time to put this out plus I know Jennifer now knows more people in the \\"business\\" like Beyonce.  I will say that there's one track where I noticed Beyonce's style of singing coming out in Jeniffer.  I don't know if anyone will agree with me here.  Wow!! what a disappointment.  I hope I'm the only person who feels the same way.  I'm glad I din't pay $13.99.  Sorry Jennifer.
B001GAPC1K|3.0|Okay, first off if you own a Web Enabled Blu-ray player like a PS3, you're going to have to wait a long time before you can watch this Blu-ray after you pop it in. Why? Some pinhead executive at the movie studio/blu-ray production house thought it would be cute to require you to download some stupid software you're probably not going to use for \\"extra features\\"  BEFORE you can even get to the main menu. I had to wait so long to watch it I thought the disc was defective. I had enough time to call Amazon and arrange a replacement. (Then I installed installed Windows XP to my MacBook and I was still waiting. If you've ever installed XP you know how long that takes too.) This means that each time I pop this Blu-ray into a new player, like if I take it to a friend's house,  I'm going to have to tell my friend(s): okay let's just wait an hour then we can watch the movie. This is completely and totally absurd. I hope whoever decided this was a good idea gets fired.    After about an hour and a half, I was able to watch this movie though. It's a really great movie. It's right up there with WALL*E and The Dark Knight. It has a very fun comic book feel to it, while not being absurdly stupid. If you can suspend your disbelief for 120 some odd minutes, it's a great ride.     Robert Downey Jr. is a great Tony Stark. When I first heard he was cast as Iron Man, I thought \\"yeah right! This movie's gonna suck.\\" But I was very wrong. He pulls off the ladies man/billionaire playboy/hot shot role very well. But this is only half of the movie: The other half: Iron Man action scenes are just flat out cool. The poses/angles they choose and CGI work are all great. This is a first rate production.     Also, I didn't know who his assistant was before the credits rolled  but she looked familiar (Turns out it was Gwyneth Paltrow) and she made a really interesting character too, for a supporting role. You even have Jeff (\\"The Dude\\") Bridges in there doing a great job playing Stark's second in command.    Oh, and when the credits roll, don't turn off the movie. There's a little scene after all the credits that fans of the comics and fans of this movie shouldn't miss.      Summary:  The Blu-Ray gets a 1 star for the incompetence of whomever decided it was a good idea to make people download something before they could even see the main menu.     The Movie Gets 5 Stars for great execution - cast/acting, storyline, effects, and action scenes. Dare I say: This is the best Marvel Comics movie to date.
B00005JPS8|5.0|My only regret is that I never saw this in theaters. This movie is great! It's really well paced, the characters seem thought out and the action... ah.. the action is fantastic! I love it all! GET IT!
0375826726|5.0|I am an avid Inheritance/Christopher Paolini fan, and as soon as Brisingr came out, I bought it. With it came many surprises, and when I say surprises, I mean SURPRISES! Wow! I believe that this book is the best in the series and everything flows really nicely together. But before you rush out to buy the book (which I know you will)I would recommend reading Eragon and Eldest first, they are wonderful too. If you happen to forget, Brisingr has a detailed synopsis in the beginning of the book that will fill you in.
0375826726|3.0|Well I have to say I really enjoyed the first two books.  Both books had some pit falls but over I really liked them.  This book however is not what I had hoped for.  After what happened on the Burning Plains (end of book 2) you would think Eragon is one strong warrior but instead he is made out to be a wimp.  He constantly is slipping on something, tripping, losing his balance, or worse yet doesn't feel someone coming to hit him from behind.  What is the point of giving him this mental magic ability if he can't use it.  Plus he is half elf doesn't that give him a little better balance.<br /><br />Roan's story in this book is better then Eragon's.  In fact I almost skipped two chapters towards the end of the book to get back to Roan's story.<br /><br />Another sore spot is the love story Paolini is trying to create.  He could have used the long winded political section of the book to bring the love interest with Eragon.  He could have moved that story along and kept readers interested; instead he wastes our time.<br /><br />Paolini constantly makes his bad guys stronger and stronger you have to wonder if he is going to be able to make a believable ending to the story.  The only thing that saved this book from being the last of the series I would read was the ending.  He did a decent job of it and it brought back some of the excitement of the story as well as removing some of the wimp factor of Eragon he introduced throughout the story.  You actually believe he can win a fight on his own towards the end which is improvement considering how clumsy he became through the beginning.<br /><br />On a side note the book could have easily been a 100+ pages lighter I found complete chapters that played no baring to the story.<br /><br />Is it worth it? If you have read the first two you are going to have to sit through this one if you have not started the series hmm your call.<br /><br />James
B0018LMZOO|5.0|This album is the Moodies' masterpiece. All their first seven albums are brilliant but this one is outstanding. All songs are fantastic. This edition is also special because of the inclusion of the beutiful  song called 'Island'.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Best SCI-fi series ever!  Fox is brainless for axing them.  I want another movie!
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars with a little better instructions on set up. It assumes a knowledge of stereo components that I don't have. But as it is I've fumbled along by trial and error and I'm getting incredible results.     My LP collection has been in the basement for the last 23 years. Frankly I assumed those records were ruined. I never had good stereo equipment or fresh needles, and I never treated them with more than casual care. However, I dragged them up to make a list of what MP3 tracks I'd like to buy and to my amazement I found that I had huge collections with songs that have never been digitalized. I also found that some of these old LPs are only available at astronomical prices. So I decided to try digitalizing my old LPs using the Sony PS-LX300 USB.    Before playing my first record, I spent a day on-line looking at the options for cleaning vinyl records. Spending hundreds of dollars on a disc cleaning system for records that I assumed were about ruined was out of the question. I settled for the RCA Discwasher for $14.95, even though reviews claimed it was vastly inferior to the old product (which sells at auction for well over $50.00). I also looked at the DIY options of washing vinyl records, but what I read indicated that drying was as important as getting a cleaner into the grooves and the RCA Discwasher brush was supposed to serve this function of both cleaning and drying.    I hooked the Sony turntable up to my Dell Laptop so I could keep working on my desktop computer while recording. The Sony turntable comes with a USB connection and also RCA cables (which are very short). The turntable comes with a switch to choose either Line or Phono. I presume from the combo offered above that you could also attach the RCA cables to speakers purchased separately to listen while recording through the USB option. I have a DAK Mixer Interface (which I never figured out) so I hooked the RCA cables into that and tried plugging their stereo mini plug into my laptop input line, but my first pass did not produce sound on the final recording -- no doubt I had to change some settings on my input line. So instead I just plugged headphones into the DAK mixer to listen while recording using the USB option.     For USB recording, I had to go into my control panel and change my Sound Recording options, but that those steps were well spelled out on page 11 of the Sony turntable manual. I'm sure with more fiddling around I can figure out how to get sound through my laptop while recording, but it's working just fine for me with headphones.    Then I thoroughly cleaned my first LP -- an old favorite I purchsed in 1961 and played to death over the next 20 years. I cleaned it a total of three separate times, assuming it was very dirty, following the directions carefully. As I pushed the start button on the Sony, I was amazed at the quality of sound coming through the headphones. I expected to hear mostly hisses and pops with a little music thrown in. I couldn't believe the quality of that old LP after cleaning. There was some cracking but mainly it was noticeable between tracks.     I used the default settings on the SoundForce Audio Studio for \\"Vinyl Recording and Restoration\\" and these pops and crackles were almost eliminated in the final product.    Right now my recordings are coming through as one track (which they mention can happen with some old LPs) but the software has a good help section which includes how to go back and separate the tracks. I'll be working through that later this morning. But right now I have my first two records digitilized with a sound quality I never believed possible. I am thrilled beyond belief and looking forward to listening to hours more of my old treasures as I compile them into a digitilized collection.    As a final note, I always scoffed at those who said that records had a warmth that is missing from CDs. I figured that only audio snobs with expensive equipment could tell a difference since Iwas quite pleased with my CDs and iPod music. But as I listen to my old LPs I am aware of exactly what they mean. There is an intimacy and depth of sound that is missing from CDs. Amazing to think that such an old technology can hold up so well, even on ill-used records that are over 45 years old.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am kind of an Austen Purist.I watched this movie trying to be open minded, and if possible, to view it as a separate entity from the book. It didn't really work.  As a romantic comedy, it would pass, but as an adaption of Pride Prejudice, it falls rather flat. First of all, the casting is rather week in most areas. Keira Knightly does a tolerable job as Elizabeth, but one can't help but be disappointed in what seems like a lack of depth to her character. Mathew McFadyen doesn't really seem to be acting at all and merely looks morose a lot of the time. Lady Catherine Debourgh (sp) is well cast in  Judie Dench, as is the actress who plays Charlotte Lucas. But that is about as far as it goes.   Nearly all of the priceless quotes and speeches that readers love so well are cut out, and by condensing the storyline to two hours, you have very little development of any relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The Pemberly scenes are very choppy and all of the beautiful scenes between Darcy and Elizabeth are non existent. The ending is quite week and is a total departure from the book. Add to all of this that her family is all portrayed as a listening behind the door, giggling all of the time group of idiots, without the exception of Jane, or her father, who are supposed to be a great deal more sensible than the rest of her family.  Finally, it just didn't really feel period accurate to me. The costumes seemed to vary, and looked as if they were assembled from more than one century,while the sets seemed incomplete and rather empty for the most part.  For anyone looking for a faithful adaption of the book, with tremendous actors and amazing quality, watch the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|Taken for itself, this is a reasonably enjoyable period piece. An unusual woman makes a place for herself in a man's world, over the misdirected wishes of her family. She earns an independent income; it's not handed to her by family or marriage. Then, she uses her hard-earned wealth to preserve the beauty of the English countryside, a legacy that lives on today. Add in some personal triumphs and tragedies and it all came across nice enough in a drawing-room kind of way, but I found it forgettable.<br /><br />What an opportunity lost. Beatrix Potter was all that - successful children's author and strong, headstrong woman in a time when that was not widely appreciated. Before taking on children's books, she was a perceptive field scientist and innovative if isolated lab mycologist. Even the male establishment was forced to acknowledge her discoveries, and the watercolor paintings that illustrated her records would still improve many modern textbooks. (That scientific training guided the gorgeous precision that rendered Peter and the rest.) In frustration she turned to children's books, a more seemly occupation for a woman, and excelled. She also established a good-sized merchandising industry around her characters, and that just multiplied her uncommon financial success.<br /><br />The real, historical Potter deserves to have movies made about her - she just doesn't deserve this one. If you ignore the actual woman, scientist, and entrepeneur that the movie portrays, you'll find a fair but undemanding costume drama. That's all, though.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
055358202X|5.0|I have to say this is the finest series I have ever read. For an intelligent, medevil soap opera it doesnt get any better. However...I am so beyond frustrated with the author. If he spent half the time he did writing in his \\"not a blog\\" or helping other authors, or whatever convention that month and focused on the novel maybe he wouldnt have so many fans irritated right now. At the end of this novel he states that Dance with dragons is almost done and blah blah blah. Well here we are 2+ years later and not even a release date to look forward to. Is he so arrogant that he thinks he fans wont desert him? Is he really not that devoted to his fans to give a crap about them? Why create an epic series to end all series and never finish it? At this rate the last book will be out in 2019. And unless he plans to live to be 90 and still writing it will never be done. I only hope that HBO wises up and options his other properties with a stipulation that he finishes the series. We could have 7 or 8 of the greatest movies, mini-series, or tv shows ever created if only someone could finish a novel. Yes I am venting and frustrated. I read the entire series every year as some sick ritual to hope that the next novel will come out. If your George RR Martin's editor, publicist, or publishing company reading this. Shame on you! Make your authors do some work. As for GRRM....I am sure you are a nice guy. But can you please finish the series before you too old to, or at least put it in the hands of a more capable author with some motivation, for the sake of your fans and your legacy.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr was way better then the first two books of the series (which should have been in the end...). But at last, we get more books...and if the next is as good as the this one, then I say bring it on.    First off, some have spoken how they wish it wouldn't have all the side stories, but quite honestly I think more stories need them. This gives a complete picture of whats going on with who. And Brisingr does it well, at least, thats my idea.    Second, its better then the first two because not once did I want to put it down. Not once did I want to skip entire chapters because I felt it was meaningless to the story. In Eldest, I thought that a lot, and in Eragon I had to force myself at times to read it. This book, however, kept my attention.    Thirdly, this book gives a good twist to a twist. And thats all I'm going to say on that!    So, I know this review sucks, but I'm trying to write it fast. :-) Its a good book, you should enjoy it if you liked the others, and even if you thought Eldest was a drag...well, Brisingr is still good :-)    [[ASIN:0375826726 Brisingr (Inheritance, Book 3)]]
1931559317|2.0|I purchased this book based on all the positive reviews. I thought it would be good for a beginner stargazer like me. This book is very confusing. Page after page of dots connected. I'm not sure where to look in the sky, what the constellations are, when to look. Help!! Maybe when I get better at finding constellations I will appreciate this book more, but in the meantime it has me puzzled.
0143038419|4.0|I agree with many of the negative reviews.  She has narcissistic and selfish tendencies.  Regarding the negative commentary on her divorce: She did say that she wasn't going to delve into their marital problems, so it's unfair to complain that she didn't seem to have reasons behind the divorce.  But to her credit, she did raise money (and put in her own) to buy a home for her friend and the orphan girls in Bali, so she's not completely void of a heart for others.  The book is about her journey of getting over her pain and \\"finding herself\\" so yes, she's going to spend a lot of time talking about herself and her pain.  Take the book for what it is: an entertaining read on a woman's travels abroad.  If you are looking for a saint's inspiring words and how poverty touches the soul, then you might be disappointed.
B001AKTZPK|5.0|I sing this song all the time - \\"When I Was A Little Bitty Baby My Mama Would Rock Me In The Cradle\\" - That might be a less popular song than others of theirs, but every time I think of them that's the 1st song that I want to hear - That song alone gets 5 stars from me!!!
084428596X|2.0|The idea behind this book is good, as well as its structure. It packs a punch information wise, compared to its size and price.<br /><br />It is, however, NOT a good book. It seems to have been compiled in haste, and the result is that it's crammed full of errors. Some are not very serious, simply sentences that, although gramtically correct, are put in a way no Norwegian would ever put it.  The list of verbs also include strange forms that I have never encountered, and I have read a lot more words than the average Norwegian. Learning something that might be correct by the dictionary, but that 99% of Norwegians themselves would take as an error, is really worse than a waste of time. (To its credit, it doesn't push the outdated De-form, which some books still do, decades after its use ended.)<br /><br />Many others mistakes include clear cut errors and misspellings, I have counted many dozens - far, far to many for a book this size.<br /><br />98% of the content is correct. Still, learning a a language from scratch is hard work, and I for one would find it very annoying to spend time getting confused and misinformed because nobody bothered to get this book proof read. Also, it is clear that the author does not have a \\"native feel\\" for the language.<br /><br />I've found clear cut Norwegian language errors on pages 27, 28, 42, 43, 44, 61, 66, 74, 78, 79, 80, 94, 97, 102, 104, 105, 112, 113, 114, 115 and 125, as well as half-errors/unnatural language on pages 32, 46, 52, 60, 62, 69, 70, 71, 72, 78, 82, 106, 107, 116, 118, 120, 122, 123. And this doesn't even include the verbs at the end. The explanatory texts are generally in better shape than the examples.<br /><br />For the record, I am a native Norwegian who writes for a living.
0784011680|5.0|I have been a fan of Charlie Chaplin and Robert Downey Jr for years. This is the perfect combonation of the two. RDJ does a wonderful job becoming Chaplin. It is not an easy task to do. I love the movie.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Just watched Iron Man Blu-ray edition, and it is fantastic. Disc one had a problem loading yesterday, but it was due to a server problem as the disc tried to access BD live. Paramount corrected the situation, and the disc plays perfect now. If your disc is taking long to load...If you have your PS3 settings set to automatically connect to the internet for BD-Live content, then the 'Iron Man' BD does that first thing. It takes about 5 minutes to download and initialize that feature. Just let the disc load once and it will load quickly everytime afterwards. Or, you can turn off the automatic internet feature under your XMB BD settings.    When I was watching my BD for the first time, I went through the same thing. Anyway, I wonder if the startup time is just different for everyone because of a hit on their servers or something. If they are downloading stuff for BD-Live at the beginning like we are speculating, then maybe a lot of people just getting home from school or off work are trying it now so the downloading is taking a lot longer.    Fantastic reference type Blu-ray. Highly recommended.
0439023483|5.0|This was a great book. I have been looking for something to keep my attention since finishing the twilight series and this is the book that did it. I am just waiting to hear more of this story. It was a great mix between action, suspense and just enough romance to keep you reading all night wanting more. Great read!
031606792X|5.0|I cannot say anything else other than I got exactly what I wanted from this story...a true fairytale happy ending.  Why ask for anything else?  Is that not the reason we all have become completely engrossed with this series?  To have everything turn out how we would want it to?  I loved the book!  Thank you Stephenie Meyer for writing a series I fell in love with...please write more about these characters...I'm not ready to put them to rest:)
B00000IQMT|5.0|Yea, I did. I love that song and found this album for less than $1 so I went ahead and bought it. Most of the track are excellent including the last one. Worth the money!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Oh where to begin.  Well I've always said the true meaning of things can be found somewhere in the middle of the bottom and that is where I will begin my review with the duet performed with Fantasia.  Track no. 8 I'm His Only Woman, a new spin to the Barbra Mason Woman to Woman cut from back in the day, these two divas let loose and reached incredible heights with their unique vocal styles.  Both divas deeply rooted in the church and their gifts undeniably from the holy creator, deliver an experience to rock your soul.  But this kind of performance we've come to expect from Jennifer. 03. Pocketbook my girl is showing versatility and proves that she can handle any genre (somewhat like her fellow Chi-town native Chaka Khan).  Spotlight is a kickass track and continues to be a pleasure to sing along to.  She closes out this CD project by returning to her roots with Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There.  So comfortable, so confident, and so incredibly touching. I was ready to start running up and down the church aisle needing the ushers to restrain me.  There are few cross over artists that can take me there and I used to hold the thrown for Kelly Price but Jennifer Hudson has made me rethink that choice.  Perhaps they need to be in concert together.........just putting it out there.  We haven't had a diva celebration since Chaka and Whitney.  Kudos Jennifer Hudson.    Fan Forever,    DJ Budda
B0016K40KY|5.0|This is the greatest film ever made.Yes, better than \\"Gone With The Wind\\", better than \\"Citizen Kane,\\" better than... you name it. It has the scope and vision of an epic, which for me is still Hollywood's grandest contribution to the art form. Small pictures can have a more personal impact, but the epic cannot really be made in a studio built off of one's garage. Spielberg and company have probably destroyed the genre with their digital monkey business; the true epic requires large casts and locations that can fill the camera. Lean found his canvas in the desert. It is certainly the greatest desert film ever made. Curiously, the film doesn't date. This says a lot about its superb script and a cast that has never been matched for talent. Even small roles are played by leading actors of the stage and screen, many now forgotten but they were legends in their time. Claude Rains comes to mind, of course, but virtually every role is filled by the best British stars of the war generation. The cinematography is breathtaking, even today when we have all been everywhere through television. Bolt's script works, balancing the sweep of the epic structure with numerous moving, personal scenes between two or three characters. Then there is the music. What can one say. Surely it is one of the greatest and most memorable of all soundtracks, a haunting, powerful evocation of the Arab peoples. In terms of politics, the film is provocative, anticipating political correctness by some thirty years in its depiction of the clash of cultures. Lawrence himself was devoted to the cultures he visited, so the theme is built into this sensitive portrayal of a most extraordinary of men.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Pre-ordered it - love it, love it, love it - Not only is it thrilling and fun Robert D is perfect and fits the roll to a T! Bravo!
0060899220|5.0|In reading this book, I could actually hear Anthony Bourdain's voice in my head. Since this was written prior to \\"A Cook's Tour\\" and \\"No Reservations\\" I felt as though I was getting the uncensored, ungroomed Tony Bourdain.    My ex-husband told me that I shouldn't read this book because if I did, I may never want to eat out again. Total crap. If anything, this makes me want to go out to eat more often, knowing how much work goes into preparing our meals. But the rule is simple, appreciate good food and the hands who prepare it and you can't go wrong.    It might be offensive to people at times, but overall I found it honest and entertaining. Adding it to my permanent collection of stuff to read over and over again.

B001CD6FKS|1.0|People who care about animals should not rent or purchase Speed Racer. On the set of Speed Racer, a representative from the American Humane Association (AHA) witnessed an animal trainer \\"in an uncontrolled impulse, hit [a] chimpanzee.\\" If a trainer is bold enough to strike an animal in front of an AHA monitor, you can only imagine what is taking place behind the scenes when no one is watching.    Great apes are beaten into submission in order to train them for use in film, television, and advertising. As babies they are forcibly separated from their mothers and trained by being beaten, kicked, and even electrocuted. By age 8, they are too strong and unruly to be safely handled, so they are often warehoused or callously discarded at substandard roadside zoos. Many languish in small cages for decades. By purchasing the Speed Racer DVD, you're supporting the abuse inflicted on great apes who are forced into the entertainment industry.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Great movie in many ways. Watched this movie over and over again with my daughter. She really loved it so did I.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|This the 7th Enigma album that Michael Cretu has created. It's really a fresh and gorgeous album. It has some elements that will remind you of the old Enigma sound, like heavy breathing, chants, etc    The special edition which is a 2 disc set gives 5 wonderful sounding songs which did not make the album cut.    All in all another well made Enigma album destined to be enjoyed for the new few years to come until Enigma 8.

0374264260|5.0|I cannot do anything else but agree with everyone.  This was a great book.  The narrator was a character I really cared about and who gave tremendous  insights into his life as an offbeat but basically good guy.  Some of his  lines were truly funny but it was not a funny book.  It was a book that made me root for Pat to get his \\"silver lining\\". I was riveted to the final few pages.
B0013FNC38|4.0|I am a big fan of Jason Mraz anyways, but this CD is very good to listen to.  The lyrics are just so awesome and take you to another place...I love Butterfly..that is the best!!
B00005JPS8|5.0|Im a huge comic book fan (just started reading them again recently) and especially love movies based on them. Ive only read one Iron man comic in my life and read other comics that include him with other heroes. But I knew I had to see this movie. Some doubted Downy JR as Tony Stark aka Iron Man because of his past. But he prooved everyone why he was perfect for the role.    This is on my list of the 5 best superhero movies of all time which includes Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Incredible Hulk and Blade.     I bought the 2 disc edition at Target which came in a different package. You get the box but the dvds itself come in a cool case that is shaped and looks like Iron Man's mask. Its the same price as this edition with the same special features but the only difference is the case.    The dvd is loaded with special features that include:    Deleted and Extended scenes (comes with the 1 disc edition as well but thats what it only has)  Behind the scenes  Still Galaries  and so much more    This dvd is perfect for any fan of comics, especially of Iron Man, or if you just love super hero movies or just a fan of movies with tons of action and special effects. This dvd is perfect for anyone.
B00005LANG|5.0|This record contains some of Marley's most famous songs such as Jamming, Waiting In Vain and of course Exodus.  Beautiful writing and performances throughout the record and People Get Ready is steller.  This is one of the best recvords ever recorded and stands up decades later.  You really cannot go wrong with any Marley recoord, but this record and Legend (a compilation) are two good ones.  Exodus is wonderful, but Legen has many of the hits from Exodus plus some other great tracks such as No Woman No Cry, Buffalo Solider and Redemption Song (probably my favorite Marley song of all of them.)
B000MTDRKE|5.0|I love everything about sola scriptura.I've found it to be very moving in some places,almost to the point of tears.This cd takes me on a spiritual and historical journey.It encourages me to stand up for God's word which very often, is difficult to do in todays world.Anyway, I think Neal has written some of his best songs on sola scriptura.it's a phenominal cd. highly recommended.
B000024D4R|5.0|one of the greatest rock albums in history!  ethereal, deep, complex, and at the same time rather simple compared to their other works.  The theme and guitar riffs are amazing.
B000086EJE|2.0|The rhymes are spoken in a monotonous manner. Had they mixed things up a bit and used different people, it would have at least been more interesting, instead it gets old fast. Children have a short attention span, so monotony was not the best idea.    The rhymes are not individually accessible, there are two tracks with 50 rhymes each, so no skipping to favorites.
B00158K0S8|1.0|I have to agree with the very few that have called Fox on its despicable job with the picture quality on Patton.<br /><br />I give the film four stars  (in case you were thinking i'm just being mean and unhelpful) and the Blu-ray one. In case you didn't red those others (and there should be MANY more critical reviews of this movie's quality), here it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />You've been duped.<br /><br />Oh no it isn't great picture quality. The remaster is AWFUL.<br /><br />Have you heard of DNR, or Digital Noise Reduction? Film has grain. 70mm film has less noticeable grain due to its large negative size. The thing is, picture detail cannot be separated from the grain and the chemical reaction when the film is exposed.<br /><br />Because people want to see things looking 'clear' and 'high-def' like HD video and digitally originated cg/3d movies, the studios are 'scrubbing' the pictures electronically to get rid of the grain. They also use a technique called 'edge enhancement' to artificially sharpen the picture by increasing areas of high contrast like edges. So what you get is a halo effect around the edges, and/or LOSS of fine details because when you erase the grain, you erase the high-frequency detail. Detail on chemical film is inseparable. Look at Karl Malden - where are the pores of his skin? HD, and certainly the original 70mm film, is capable of showing this. Now go and look at Patton again. Just atrocious. You've been robbed and don't even know it. Compare it to another 'war' movie, Blackhawk down. THAT's detail and picture quality. Yes Patton is older, but it was shot on 70mm and there should be plenty of detail so you can actually compare the two differently aged films.<br /><br />Look at Jennifer Connelly's face in Hulk where you can see pores and fine hair, peachfuzz and so on. Then look at something like the Dark City BD, where it's been erased (even though she's younger there!). In Sweeney Todd, the worst thing is they only applied the DNR around the nose and cheeks/under the eyes. See how 'blurred' it looks! They didn't even put grain back over the top to match the rest of the picture - and the most ridiculous thing of all is that in Sweeney Todd Depp and Carter are SUPPOSED to look drawn and tired and lined! It's just ludicrous! And they DON'T do it to other characters! Look at Depp's face in the Pirates movies. THAT'S what you should be seeing, colour grading and tone aside.<br /><br />I won't even start on how many filmmakers use coarser grain to make the tone/film literally more 'gritty'. On purpose.<br /><br />DNR is the devil, to be melodramatic about it. I'm not buying Patton on BD until they 'fess up and 'unfix' the thing. HD and Blu-ray are supposed to let you see a film as ACCURATELY to the original as possible. Not this rubbish.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Can't go wrong with this CD.  Has some of the great Elvis classics that everyone loves and recognizes.  Can't say much  more than that.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melody Gardot has a soulful voice that combines with catchy tunes on this cd.  It has become one of my favorites since buying. I have very eclectic taste in music, so I don't come at this cd as just a jazz fan. Take her as she is...she makes beautiful music.
B000OPOANE|5.0|its frick n great, and amazing these guy have been play n so ong n through so much and havnt lost a bit of what they have always had, so this album is just more of what we love, damn their good, just remember this is a dvd, not a cd, but its not a video, its a dvd so you can listen to it in 5.1, if you dont have that but the cd, if you do you may want to buy both, unless your car has a dvd player, injoy mates!
0596522347|5.0|I typically post reviews of books based on technology topics like .NET, LINQ, etc. but I thought this book would be a could fit for the site.  This book is about creating effective PowerPoint slides which many technology professionals, like myself, do on a regular basis. On to the review...<br /><br />The author breaks up the book into multiple chapters but not your typically kind of chapters.  These chapters are about the different parts that make up a slide; graphics, displaying data, diagrams, use of movement, etc.  Each chapter is typically closed with a Case Study which demonstrates the use of the technic or recommend. This is done by showing a before and after presentation.  The author also reinforces her points effectively by using graphics, colors and illustrations.<br /><br />The book is chock full of handy tips and suggestions that anyone can use to create dazzling and effective PowerPoint slides.  If you present using PowerPoint, this is a must have.
B0019EXZYE|4.0|This movie was a blind buy for me. It is a really good movie that is well written and has excellent pacing. Everybody puts in a good performance, and since it is based off of actual events it is not over the top like Statham flicks have been as of late. Very well done.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Let it be known that I would be one of the first to stand up against all the Hollywood remakes. This is actually the first time I've wanted to see a remake, and I caught it the weekend it came out. And I must say, I was entertained the whole time. I think if you look at this movie as a football comedy, and not try to compare it to the Burt Reynolds version, you'll enjoy it. I think a lot of people are turned off by this movie for that reason, and because they see this as being nothing more than \\"The Waterboy Pt. 2\\". But it's not, despite the cameo by Rob Schneider (sp?), which honestly, I could've done without. The characters could've been a little more developed...I mean, why should we root for the \\"Mean Machine\\", other than the fact that the guards were really corrupt? With no character development, it just seemed like we were rooting for the lesser of two evils. The library racism scene w/Nelly was a nice start, but there could've been a few more scenes like that.  Like I said, it's a pretty entertaining movie, once you realize that 1) it's not the Burt Reynolds version, and 2) it's not trying to be. If you're a football fan, you'll like this movie. The game will probably get you energized, especially the last moments of the game. I usually don't like a bunch of gratuitous split-screens and camera shots, but for a movie like this, it works (in this case, it almost seems like a homage to the original).
0061537934|5.0|I'm not a dog-owner and I have no interest in race-car driving (or watching), but I still loved this book. Enzo's musings on life apply to all of us.

B000009RC2|5.0|I was 13 years old in 1974 when a friend played \\"Dawn\\" from this album for me. I had already started to study guitar, and wanted to be just like Jimi Hendrix. But that song completely blew away any ideas I'd previously had abut music. I was shocked; I didn't think that what they were doing was humanly possible. Especially McLaughlin's guitar work.<br /><br />The whole album seemed to pick up a momentum begun by Miles Davis, and take it into an area of its own. It was important in the development of music. And quite beautiful.
B0019T9FL6|2.0|Jennifer Hudson is a great talent with an amazing, emotional voice. Her debut CD does not measure up. Her voice is amazing throughout the new tracks, but the production and even some guest appearances (Ludacris and T-Pain) do nothing to lift this CD to her awesome voice. Several tracks are over produced and you hear more sound score than Jennifer. And the music is more than less than memorable. Jennifer Hudson and Ludacris? T-Pain? Even Timbaland produced track is a let down. The Robin Thicke produced track is nice. Guest, Fantasia is excellent with Jennifer. The last track is a very nice Gospel song. Her voice is enough to move mountains (our next Patti Labelle). She should have had better production and material. The bonus CD includes the best track of all, Stand Up. I really hope her second score is more deserving of her impressive talent.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|DON'T NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWS!!!  The only reason people are giving this 1 star is due to the production of the discs.  I myself have had no issues with my copy on my PS3.    This movie is spectacular.  It isn't a fight-fest like most of the comic based movies, which is great.  It goes into the story of Tony Stark and what made him become \\"Iron Man\\".      Currently watching it for the 3rd time... :)

0316113506|5.0|John Ratey is well known for his groundbreaking work on Attention Deficit Disorder. He coauthored the book, \\"Driven to Distraction\\" with Ed Hallowell. His newest book is \\"Spark- The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain.\\" I found Spark a fascinating read. Ratey cites dozens of studies that span decades and continents. All point to the same conclusion: exercise, and aerobic exercise in particular, boosts the release of important neurotransmitters and enhances cognitive function. For people with ADD or ADHD, this boost can be life changing. Ratey is not prescribing exercise as the \\"cure\\" for attention issues, but he does offer specific examples of people who have used exercise to combat the negative effects of stress and attention problems. Many were able to reduce or eliminate ADD medications, though he clearly states that for some people, a combination treatment of both medication and structured exercise may be best.<br /><br />Ratey talks at length about the success of a special gym program instituted in Naperville, Illinois. The emphasis is on personal fitness. Students in this area have very strong tests scores and a very low rate of childhood obesity. In other places around the country that have implemented a similar program, standardized scores have risen dramatically. These case studies are fascinating.<br /><br />\\"Spark\\" has inspired me to increase my own exercise routine, and also to institute morning recess at home each day. My homeschooled kids are absolutely loving it and we're finding the morning transitions go much more smoothly when we all look forward to getting outside and moving our bodies! We've been running laps on the driveway (five times back and forth to the mailbox is about a mile), doing calisthenics, playing four square, jump rope, and kickball. My three year old has her own method of jumping jacks that is just hilarious to watch. My daughter who has the hyperactive sort of attention deficit enjoys sprinting before school, and appears to have less trouble focusing after she has been active. I think my next investment will be a basketball hoop!<br /><br />Everyone knows that exercise is good for the body, but it is high time that we recognize how good it is for the mind. For a child who has attention issues, a solid workout each morning may make a real difference. I'd be skeptical of a drug that claimed to, \\"supercharge your mental circuits to beat stress, sharpen your thinking, lift your mood, boost your memory, and much more\\" , but these are very real affects that regular exercise can produce. Not all exercise is equally effective in fighting symptoms of ADD. Read this book to find out how to implement a regimen that will work for you or your children.less trouble focusing after she has been active. I think my next investment will be a basketball hoop!

B00007KLJJ|4.0|I say that because I had heard so many negative things about it. But because it is a Heath Ledger flick - I had to rent it and see for myself. I ended up really liking it...to the point I knew I would have to add it to my dvd collection. On the strength of Heath's performance alone, I can recommend this film. His character goes through so much to find himself and by the end of the film - he's a different man. To watch Heath go through this transformation is pretty amazing. Would definately recommend it - Heath you are missed.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|just like \\"a knight's tale\\"...and \\"10 things i hate about you\\", this flick just makes you laugh and feel good. The fact that the star of this flick (Heath Ledger) is more beautiful to look at than most the women in the film is also a plus. After breaking our hearts in Brokeback Mountain, Heath makes up for it cracking us up and making us swoon here. As always, his work in this film is great. Even though it is not a film to be taken too seriously, there is always an intensity in Heath's performances. This is worth the watch!
B00000F14B|2.0|The first and last thirds of the movie are Ok -- not great quality -- but the middle third hangs up time after time.

B0018O4YT0|5.0|A $28 million budget art house film that features several actors who have now ascended the ranks of stardom beat The Matrix to the punch in presenting many on screen concepts that questioned what it is to be human.  Very underrated, constantly drifting on the edge of obscurity, Dark City is a magical film that transcends many levels of modern filmmaking with questions of human nature and interactions.<br /><br />The story follows John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who wakes up in a bath tub at the scene of a murder where he soon finds himself pursued by a mysterious group of black clad, pale fleshed men lead by Richard O'Brien (you may know him as the creator, writer, and co-star of the midnight screened, all-time cult favorite musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and John must receive aid from a man claiming to be his doctor (TV's 24 star Kiefer Sutherland). Discovering that the black-clad men (referred to as Strangers) control all that is within the city it is up to John to discover the secret of the city, the Strangers, and why the city never sees daylight. To do this he must discover the location of Shell Beach; the place everyone knows about, but no one seems to remember the directors to.  In the process he'll have to face the strangers, discover the secret to the eternal night, and the true extent of the Stranger's plans for the inhabitants...then he must find the strength hidden within him to free everyone from the stranger's hold.<br /><br />Dark City has over the past 11 years become a cult-favorite, starring actors who have risen in status in recent years, starring film-cult-figure Richard O'Brien, and being the immediate follow-up of director Alex Proyas' critically acclaimed adaptation of The Crow (which starred the late Brandon Lee who died from a technical accident during filming) and Proyas continues to dazzle with low-budget visual flair in this film-noir masterpiece that earned the title of being Roger Ebert's top film of 1998. Alex Proyas may be used as a corporate tool now, having his style severely cut back by studio control (see: I'Robot, and Knowing, both of which are severely different than Proyas' original ideas) but Dark City remains a great film that shows what a dedicated director can do with limited budget and limitless imagination.<br /><br />DVD to watch: I strongly recommend the director's cut over the theatrical cut, not so much because of content, but because the pacing of the director's cut is infinitely superior to that of the theatrical cut.<br /><br />The director's cut DVD also comes with commentary tracks by director Proyas and film critic Roger Ebert (essentially the last audio track the critic did before cancer took his voice) both of which are very insightful into the story of the film (okay both gave commentaries for the theatrical cut as well, but these are even better).  Proyas of course gives more technical facts when commentating while Ebert (as the critic) is more on noting Proyas' visual choices and story points.  Both are must sees for fans of this film!<br /><br />\\"Sleep now~\\"e tool now, having his style severely cut back by studio control (see: I'Robot, and Knowing, both of which are severely different than Proyas' original ideas) but Dark City remains a great film that shows what a dedicated director can do with limited budget and limitless imagination.

055358202X|5.0|Are you people serious? If you want a simple, uncomplicated story, stick with Hary Potter. This series is not for light readers.  GRRM has created a monster that almost escapes his control. His world is so vast and full of amazing characters that all other modern fantasy novels seem weak.  Oh! Too many characters! Oh my, where are all the main ones??!1?!  STFU and enjoy this for what it is, a monster novel that never stops evolving.  I for one, can not wait for A Dance with Dragons. I can't wait to see what happens to the rest of the cast.

0446677450|5.0|If you want to be rich, start by asking someone who is!    I enjoyed Robert's book and recommand it to anyone who wants to get their finances straight and start accumulating wealth. It's a simple concept that most of us know-but we sometimes need that \\"ah hah moment\\" for us to start doing it.    This book is great for anyone that doesn't like the \\"boring\\" statistical business/investing books, because it explains the ideas through a story. Robert references the book, Richest Man in Babylon-which is a great book to pair with Rich Dad,Poor Dad because it identifies the strategy of \\"paying yourself first\\".     In this book the phrase, \\"Everyone wants to go to heaven, but know one wants to die\\", was used to reference how everyone says they want to be rich but no one wants to do what they have to become rich-they want it handed to them. We all know that doesn't happen! This phrase really connected to me and I applied it to more than just my finances but really my life and how important it is to go after what you want. So often we put things off in our life \\"until we have the money\\",(kids, marriage, school, business). In most cases you have to take a \\"little risk to get a gain\\", or it passes by us.    I highly recommend this to anyone that might need that little extra push. Have a plan and go for it!    Enjoy the book!

B0017TYPIG|5.0|I remember this film vividly because when I first saw it, it was at a cinema in Paris--and this was my first time in the City of Light!!  Also I was on my 3 day leave from the Air Force and when I saw that famous scene when warden Strother Martin beat Luke (Newman) after he says, \\"Boss, why are you so nice to me?\\" to which Martin utters the famous lines, \\"What we have here is a failure--to communicate\\", it rang in my ears as an ironic twist to my days in Basic training. The late Paul Newman, who died just this last Friday, the 26 of September, lived and died like his character, Luke, in defiance but always smiling.  His defiance was in what people had pegged him for--the handsome movie star with beautiful blue eyes with a classical face.  Instead he channeled  this defiance into helping other less fortunate people than he was---the terminally ill children (the Hole in the Wall), relief funds for the people in the Gulf, various charities, etc.  Also he lived away from Hollywood, in Connecticut where he and his family were just folks. But another reason I've seen this movie countless times is because it was shot near my hometown of Stockton, California---those crossroads in the film sure remind of the Valley.  This film could stand as perhaps the best or if not one of the best, a great film in the Newman catalog--it pre-dated other rebel films like \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" and \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" by almost a decade.  If one could chose one film that is indicative of Paul Newman--this is it!!
B0019T9FL6|1.0|Jennifer is a great success story. It seems hard to believe that its almost been 2 years since Dreamgirls came out and a fan like me was wondering when is she ever going to release her debut CD. In the end i realized that perhaps her heart just wasnt to into the MUSIC. Finally Spotlight gets released and its a cute single. It took a bit to grow on me but it has a great chorus and nice background vocals. Other then that after spinning this album a few times i still havent found any redeeming tracks that i love or tracks that stand out enough to be a winner. This album seemed very directionless and if any artist takes 2 years to churn out an album you should either have a masterpiece or an album done half azz job. Unfortunately thats what we get here, something half done. I guess over the course of 2 years she just sang track to track when she had free time or nothing to do. Jennifer already has a very soulful voice so adding a church choir to some of the background vocals only sends the song to ethnic over drive. \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\" shouldnt even be on this album. I felt like the producers were doing everything they can to provide fans with as little new material as possible. Adding that song was trying so hard to make this release have over 10 songs. The song from the Sex & The City soundtrack isn't even on here. The last song about Jesus is ridiculous!!! What does Jennifer know about a Jewish Rabbi whose mother claimed she had her son without intercourse. There's only really 1 good song on this entire album and thats the Diane Warren written song. None of the tracks here seem interesting, relevant, or addictive enough to keep me interested. Here's hoping that her next album will have better producers.<br /><br />Stand out tracks are:<br />You Pulled Me Through (Best Song on the Album 10/10)<br />Spotlight (Good 08/10)<br />If This Isnt Love (Good 08/10)

B001DDBCUA|5.0|Sex and the City - The Movie is absolutely delightful. Sarah Jessica Paker slips back into perfect ease as writer Carrie Bradshaw, the rest of the cast definitely left a good impression on me expect Jennifer Hudson, not a big fan of her work. This film is much more dramatic and that's a good thing, I was hoping the movie verison wouldn't be fluffy or superficial. The writing is still top notch thanks to Michael Patrick King, the look of the film is great as well. I highly recommend this gem of a movie, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!
B001CIPU3G|3.0|I heard the first few singles off of Shogun late in the summer and I thought, yes!, this is a step up from The Crusade, which was awful. Thew singles sounded alright and from what I know of Trivium is their single's are usually not very good and are somewhat \\"radio-friendly\\". Unfortunately on this album the singles are the highlights. The guitar radically improved from The Crusade, but Matt's screaming and lyrics have greatly suffered, his singing is great but I want Ascendancy-style-Trivium with the majority of the vocals screams. The other irritating thing about this album is the odd transitions, it leaves almost no flow through many of the songs. Oh, well...go back and listen to Ascendancy and hope this is a small step back on the right track.
B00005T7I1|3.0|Dick Tracy starring Warren Beatty is a stylish and colorful film based on the comic book but the plot is not so hot. The cast is great, Warren, Madonna, Al Pacino and many more light up the screen. Madonna who plays Breathless Mahoney is fabulous in this movie, she sings as well. After all these years, Dick Tracy kind of loses its luster but the picture quality is wonderful so check this '90s classic out soon!
B0019T9FL6|2.0|There are charming moments scattered through Jennifer Hudson's long-awaited debut CD, but the bulk of the pot is hindered with producers de trop, spoiling the broth with more than a mere soupcon of overkill.  Here is a rare, great voice that's guttural and restrained, thunderous and lovely, mired through a bakers dozen of aimless, directionless tracks that juxtapose the sublime, the surreal and the ridiculously laughable (even Hudson's gift can't save the laughing stock that is T-Pain).<br />Her duet with co-American Idol contestant and victor Fantasia recalls classic soul, beginning with its opening pitch-perfect corny spoken-word dialogue and perfect-pitch melody.  Hudson has the bigger role, naturally, but both voices kick ass without over-doing the histrionics and (thankfully) melisma.  It's a real diva showdown without the faux diva hysterics.  The closing gospel number is sung brilliantly, of course, as this is her innate m&eacute;tier - and she soars, the \\"Dreamgirls\\" number a given (she saved that bore of a musical from the hack clutches of the pretentious, soul-free Beyonce), and first single \\"Spotlight\\" is a funky enough step in the right contemporary direction.<br />Alas it's her other two \\"duets\\" that are an encumbrance above all else.  The above-mentioned T-Pain - whose irrelevance and deadbeat shtick wore out its (un)welcome long ago - and the insipid Ludacris, the world's biggest selling minstrel rapper (50 Cent notwithstanding) - do nothing but display the incessant racism in modern R&B (note to Clive & Co - not every black singer has to be mandatorily hooked up with pass&eacute; Hip Hop sludge for a mass appeal).  What could have been a stirring Soul/R&B debut winds up a generic, near-spiritless collection of wan corporate pop.  That Hudson will prevail is the real consolation.  My grade: B-
B000GG4Y32|1.0|\\"Reds\\" is an irritatingly self-satisfied film telling the story of two unbelievably selfish and naive American communists John Reed and Louise Bryant (played by a smug Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton).<br /><br />Since the film was made in 1981 communism has fallen rendering the fledgling communist movement in the US - and this film - largely irrelevent and reinforcing how naive and misguided people like John Reed and his colleagues were - one can't help but be disgusted as one watches the film at how they were prepared to look the other way as the Bolsheviks tyrannised the Russian population.<br /><br />The low budget look of the film, combined with its mediocre actors and gargantuan length (188 minutes) give \\"Reds\\" the feel of one of those 80s mini-series. Only Jack Nicholson as writer Eugene O'Neill gives it any spark. Smug communist propaganda and boring at that.
B00005JKG9|5.0|It's a David Mamet movie: enough said.<br /><br />Ok, I'll say a couple more things as if you didn't already know them. But if you don't know about this movie -- just see it is the point. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is an adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize-winning play by the brilliant playwright-screenwriter David Mamet. Al Pacino, Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey are all in it. They worked for low pay just to be in this movie. There were many other famous names that expressed interest. It's a story of real estate salesman that are desperate as hell to meet their quotas or else get fired. Mamet created a role for Baldwin just for the film version in which he plays a \\"motivator\\" brought in by the corporate office. Alec Baldwin is now almost synonymous with characters of this type. As the exectutive motivator he delivers one of the most famous monlologues in film history: \\"Coffee's for closers\\". You just gotta experience it for yourself. The story takes place over a couple days and you watch the salesman struggle to save their careers. All the acting is great. Jack Lemmon is considered by many to give the performance of a lifetime. The dialogue is golden. The acting is superb. The director James Foley did a good job helping bring the play to the screen. Clearly the story offers a critique American business in the go-go 80s, but beyond that it's just masterful story telling.(Last I heard Mamet has converted from self described \\"brain dead liberal\\" to \\"conservatism\\" apparently largely through reading Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell. He announced this in a fascinating and arguably absurd essay entitled, \\"Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal'\\" that portrays \\"liberalism\\" as idealistic nonsense out of touch with human nature and reality. Well perhaps his version of liberalism, but this ain't the place to get into that.) Movies written by David Mamet are always worth checking out and always interesting. Actors get all the attention but you can understand why Mamet got a little bit from the general public even though he merely wrote that dialogue and created characters that highlight actors' careers. That's all I have to say. See the movie if you haven't. The DVD has some great bonus material.y Mamet got a little bit from the general public even though he merely wrote that dialogue and created characters that highlight actors' careers.

0007105045|5.0|I've always wanted to read Tolkien's other works; I've read the Silmarillion a couple of times, and never really enjoyed it as much as the Hobbit or LOTR. But nonetheless, I've had an old copy of a Tolkien book called Tree and Leaf for years -- it was my parents' originally -- and I finally dove into it.<br /><br />It's short, only two pieces, but it was excellent -- and excellent in a way that makes me ten times more eager to look for other Tolkien ephemera than The Silmarillion ever did. The first part of this is an essay, expanded from a lecture Tolkien gave, called On Fairy-Stories. And not only was it interesting and well-written, it had some absolutely brilliant insights; I don't know if they were Tolkien's or simply common knowledge among Oxford literature dons, but I loved reading about the power of adjectives, and the concept of the sub-creator, and the idea that a fantasy world does not require a suspension of disbelief, but rather an acceptance of an internal continuity that allows a sub-creation of a new world within the pages, a world that, if well done by the author and well-read by the audience, requires no suspension of disbelief but merely a shift in sensory input, from direct input to that which is imagined from the words. Great idea that I'm not doing justice to, but intend to revisit and clarify further in my own mind, and use to my advantage. It certainly reaffirmed my belief that Tolkien was the leading light of the fantasy genre, both because of his immense gifts as a writer, and because he understood fantasy, its advantages and disadvantages, its requirements and its place in literature and our lives.<br /><br />And as a final piece of proof, the second piece in the book is a fairy-story that Tolkien wrote, called \\"Leaf by Niggle,\\" which was simply lovely from start to finish. Twenty pages, and it encapsulated the sense of being a frustrated artist in the real world, and the advantages of living, therefore, in an invented world -- advantages that are not just for the artists, but also for their neighbors -- in addition to having a nice moral on the power of art to lead us home. Once again, Tolkien takes his place in the big chair.st for the artists, but also for their neighbors -- in addition to having a nice moral on the power of art to lead us home.

Normally, I can't watch all special features that come with most disk sets, but, this Terminator set of special features are worth watching and are easy to enjoy.  They make you want to see the next one till they are all viewed.  I hope the Terminator - Sara Connor Chronicles Complete Second Season is compiled and produced similar to this first set.

I think it was a great ending, tying in many new characters and history and it shouldn't have ended any other way.  It was a fantastic, enticing, interesting read.  I recommend the series to everyone.
B0011Z3334|5.0|I really want to hate this kind of album. I'm pushing 30 (clearly not the target audience). I was around when the first wave of emo collapsed in the late 90s. For me a lot of the current emo bands have a \\"been there, done that\\" feel to them and generally prompt me to say \\"The Get up Kids did it better 10 years ago\\". I was shocked when this album really only had one clunker on the whole thing (Hallelujah). I'm used to one or two good songs from these new emo bands, not 11.    This band is actually pretty good, especially for such a young group. They have a strong female vocalist, sing-a-long choruses and good pop sensibilities. Unlike 99% of emo bands, they also have a good sense of rhythm (even the older emo bands generally struggled with that). Probably the best emo album released lately by someone other than Jimmy Eat World. It doesn't surprise me that the kids love this album. I can see why. It's good.

B001GAPC1K|3.0|Let me start off by saying that Iron Man is a great movie. It's easily one of the best Marvel Comics based movies I've seen, right up there with the X-Men movies and the Spiderman movies. The special effects are great and make it one of the most Blu-Ray worthy movies I've seen in a while. The action is top notch and Robert Downey Jr. nails the role of Tony Stark dead on.    Unfortunately, I have to knock down the rating for one simple reason. The blue ring of death that occurs because of the player trying to download the BDLive content is inexcusable. Basically, you absolutely cannot play the movie because your Blu-Ray player is trying to access web-based special content. I'm sure this will be cleared up once traffic to the server is cleared up. Until then, there's a problem.     Yes there it is a simple matter to go into your settings and turn off the internet connection or disable BDLive. But there is no mention on the package that this blue ring of death could happen nor any mention of how to clear it up. I had no way of knowing that this is what the problem was. I came pretty close to taking my copy back to the store I got it from and exchanging it for another disk that would have the same problem. It's only because I happened to see G.Chance's review that I saved myself the trouble. Thanks G.Chance. That's well worth a helpful vote.    I paid Blu-Ray prices for a Hi-Def movie, not for a puzzle with no clue as how to solve it. Quality Control really dropped the ball on this one.    However, like I said, this is a great movie. I'm sure once the server traffic lightens up, things will work fine. Until then, there are going to be a lot of people wondering what's wrong with their disks. Not a good way to start a release, Paramount.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|Black Hawk Down. What can I say? This movie is flawless. Absolutley flawless. Maybe better than Saving Private Ryan. You have to admit, Saving Private Ryan was great, but Black Hawk Down is greater. People that say say Black Hawk Down isn't good, Your not right in the head. Everyone in this move is awesome. From Josh Hartnett to Ewan mcGregor. I have a note to Josh Hartnett, Keep up with the war movies Josh. Pearl Harbor might not have been good, but he was good in it.  Before I get off the subject lets talk about the movie. The two hour strait fighting scenes are good. The acting is good. The sound is good. The special effects are good. What's there to talk about? This Movie comes out on DVD on June 11. See the friken movie. You won't be angry.
B0015FML06|5.0|First, oh well, it's not the unedited show: \\"Two Hearts Beats as One\\" is sans \\"Let's Twist Again\\" and the \\"Send in the Clowns\\" snip has been cut from \\"The Electric Co.\\" That said, I really don't care. The show rocks. Not sure the CD has any real value, beyond being a remaster, but the DVD of the full concert is astonishingly crisp, given the production value. This was U2 making it big before they made it big, and an important moment for fans who've been following U2 since the early days. The director's commentary is strangely quaint -- it appears he hasn't seen the full-length video since he edited it many years ago, but that makes his commentary fresh and lively.    What should be said is that the show transcends U2 in many ways. Here's a small act with a big sound trying to persuade the world. On that level alone it has merit.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Amon Amarth is one of the great Viking metal bands. they literally put on a good show with this album and DVD. whenever Metal Blade has sound samples of this band, I hit the \\"skip intro\\" button so I can be in for a surprise when I get the album. these guys have a great future ahead of them, as well as all the artists on Metal Blade. I cannot wait for them to release their next album. I might get the albums from them that I have not gotten in the meantime.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Matt Damon rocks in these movies -- he is amazing -- the action is suspenseful and real. I wish there were more coming!
B001GH63IE|5.0|The two best songs are \\"Seven Lives\\" and \\"The Same Parents\\". The problem in the past with Enigma is that much of their music sounds the same. You will find many similarities but there is also more experimentation to this album. \\"Seven Lives\\" has a hip hop flavor to the beat which surprised me but it makes it a powerful number worth listening to.
0679745203|5.0|Few books are felt as much as read, but \\"The English Patient\\" falls into this category. Like the film, it is hauntingly beautiful, but for different reasons. The story of people haunted by love and war, their damaged souls converging at a villa in Italy, remains, but the focus and method in which the story is told on paper is spellbinding and stunning.<br /><br />The passages are like water moving to and fro over rocks, shifting back and forth in time so that the beauty beneath can still be seen, but as a shimmering mirage in the desert. It is a strange instance where it is almost recommended that you see the film first in order to see more clearly in your mind the characters as their stories unfold.<br /><br />Whereas the film focused more on the burned Almasy and his memories of the unending African desert, where he would meet the enigmatic and beautiful Katherine Clifton, sealing the fate which would leave him a charred and hollow shell of his former self, Hanah is the centerpoint of Ondaatje's lovely poetic prose in the novel. You can almost feel the ghosts hovering over each character as Ondaatje paints a masterpiece with words.<br /><br />Deeply romantic and lyrical, it is the same story, but a more impressionistic and less linear portrait of love and loss. The book is like a delicate flower just beneath the waters, its beauty evident but achingly kept just out of reach. The film brought the flower into the sun so we could enjoy its texture and fragrance in a more real fashion. Both are magnificent, just a different picture of the same flower.<br /><br />If you love the film, you must read the book. It is a hauntingly beautiful novel different from anything else you'll ever read. A masterwork of rich and evocative prose that will touch the heart, an organ of fire.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|This really is a nice cd, but when I think about Jennifer Hudson, I don't think of her as having a \\"nice\\" voice, but a POWERFULL voice.  The CD is good and it's worth purchasing.  However, I have to say that track #10 \\"We Gon' Fight\\" is truly classic Jennifer.  I almost fell out of my seat when I heard it.  This song reflects what I was expecting from the entire album.  I would purchase the album just becasue of this song.  I hope you enjoy it!
B000Y9PILI|5.0|1 star!?!  Based on listening to download clips!?!  C'mon man get a grip really.  This is HIGH RESOLUTION disc.  This is a beautiful recording of a brilliant album FINALLY getting the treatment it deserves.  Both the 2 channel and surround are a stunning revelation.
0375826726|5.0|Can't help it, I loved it. Literary master piece - no, but then again I can't get through the first 4 chapters of War and Peace and have no desire to return to it. I will probably read `Brisingr' again and again. The kids loved the book and won't stop talking about it, they are play acting the scenes, as well, and anything that gets them to read (and re-read) is a plus.
B001C08RHA|5.0|You I had heard many times this is an awesome movie, and I agree. When I was a kid Iron Man was my favorite comic book so I was happy about this transition to the screen. The story, acting, directing, effects, and music were excellent. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges give stand out performances. I can't wait for the sequels. The DVD quality is excellent and the single disc played fine on DVD player and PC. The only extras are the deleted scenes on the single disc but then it was only $14.99 if you pre-ordered. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy action movies. Great quality DVD with exceptional replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"Hellboy\\". Some super heroe sequels aren't as good on many of the super hero original movies and a couple were less than stellar on the first release, let's hope Iron Man sequels will be the exception.<br /><br />CA Luster
B000URDEB0|5.0|This is the first Nightwish album to be released after the public firing of former vocalist Tarja Turrunen. Although Tarja will be sorely missed, it is time we give our full attention to the new vocalist, Annette Olzon. Though the rabid Tarja fans out there still refuse to give Annette a chance, I found myself quite impressed with her, and am looking forward to hearing more from her in the future.   The first thing you'll notice is the difference in their vocal styles. Annette has more of a soulful rocker approach, as oppossed to Tarja's beautiful soprano. Though Tarja definately has more range, Annette has a lot of enthusiasm and energy that's hard not to like. Her vocals are reminiscant of a storyteller, which is very approapriate for a lot of the songs in this album.  But the band's sounds have evoled as well. Band leader Toumas has really evolved as a composer, utilizing a full orchestra for this album. Bass player Marco also get's to contribute many more vocals than in past albums, even having his own solo song, Master Passion Greed. I highly reccomend this album, even to those who are sceptical of the band being good without Tarja. I assure that they are, and are more than capable of evolving further.  Reccomended tracks: Poet and the Pendulum, Sahara, Amaranth, 7 Days to the Wolves, Meadows of Heaven.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have the Nikon D40x.  My brother, who is a professional photographer recommended this flash to me.  I was concerned about adding extra weight to my camera.  No worries here.  The Nikon SB-400 is very light.  It uses 2AA batteries (I bought rechargeables).  It's very fast to get ready.  And the results...Wow!  I took some indoor pictures, bounced the light off the ceiling by tilting the flash up and the skin tones were beautiful.  Very natural.  It makes my pictures look (almost) professional!  Even my brother was impressed!  So, if you are looking for a lightweight flash to make your pictures look great, then I highly recommend the Nikon SB-400.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been waiting for some good old fashioned metal and this is the answer. I have enjoyed all of Metallica's albums with St. Anger being the least favorite. However this one is up there with the best. It seems that most people are disappointed with the sound quality. I have the CD version and it's not bad at all. The only way I listen to music is from my PC and I have a 200W speaker system so it sounds pretty good or maybe I have gone deaf. Anyway it is very good and I rate it 5 stars as I cannot find fault with a single track.
0307346617|5.0|It's finally happened. The zombie apocalypse has come and devastated civilisation...but in the end, civilisation rallied and won. Using tactics pioneered in South Africa and bankrolled by Cuba, the largest nation to remain infection-free, the world's armies successfully defeated the undead menace, but only at a staggering cost in lives and resources. Ten years after victory was declared, a journalist travels the world, listening to the stories of the survivors, from those who were there when the outbreak began to those who listened in the corridors of power as key decisions were taken to the stories of everyday men and women thrust into circumstances beyond their control. From Hawaii to China, even to the isolated crew of the International Space Station, this is the story of that war.    World War Z is that most beloved of Hollywood ideas, 'high concept'. One of those ideas that makes other writers go away smacking themselves in the head thinking, \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" Zombies are very much 'in' these days, but after several years of zombie movies and computer games the appeal was waning, until Brooks' interesting take on the concept revitalised interest. Most zombie fiction is somewhat nihilistic, ending with the world overrun by the undead hordes or humanity reduced to tiny enclaves battling the mindless hordes, so the fact that World War Z features a victory is interesting enough. The stories of what sacrifices were necessary to achieve that victory makes up the book, which is essentially a 'mosaic' novel rather than a standard work of fiction. The book shifts between the different interviewees, some of whom appear only once but most of them reappear periodically throughout the book, as we find out how they survived the decade of the war and what happened to them along the way.    It's an excellent device and Brooks employs it skillfully. Some of the stories border on the silly - the blind Japanese gardener taking on the zombie hordes with a sword in a park full of traps stretches credulity - but elsewhere Brooks nails the feeling of total horror, with the computer nerd trying to flee his infested Japanese apartment block or the soldiers fighting to clear the catacombs under Paris. Elsewhere Brooks takes the capabilities of the zombie menace to their logical conclusion, with heavily-armoured divers fighting off zombie forces underwater, or the US army making full use of dogs (who are driven wild by the presence of zombies) in fighting the hordes and the fates of both the animals and their handlers during and after the war.    This is a widescreen story, with a truly global perspective, told economically and well. There are some good laughs (the new US zombie-dispatching firearm is nicknamed a 'Meg', as it resembles a Megatron toy from Transformers; during one battle a nun and REM lead singer Michael Stipe help fight off the zombie hordes), but Brooks takes his subject mostly seriously and sounds some cautionary notes along the way. To some extent the story isn't really about the zombies, but about people and what they are capable of when their backs are against the wall.    World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War (*****) is a gripping, page-turning, memorable read which throws some fresh impetus on an old idea, and makes it work brilliantly. The book is available in the UK from Duckworth and in the USA from Three Rivers Press. A movie version is in development, with a script being written by Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski.
0307165485|5.0|I used to spend HOURS just looking through the book at all the illustrations.  The stories didn't always grab me, but the pictures did.  There was SO much going on.  I remember especialy the picture of the castle with the moat and all the mice.  Man hours and hours of fun!  Now, at 35, I have my first son.  I bought this book 5 years ago \\"just in case.\\"  Looks like I get to watch him have fun with it too!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I first heard of this band after one of my friends found out I was a fan of the female fronted rock band Evanescence. As an expert on symphonic metal, my friend let me borrow his copy of this album, and I was blown away. Although I still love Evanescence, Nightwish easily outclasses them in orchastration and complexity, creating a rich gothic atmosphere that is hard to surpass. Fans of Amy Lee's excellent vocals will fall in love with Tarja Turrunen, whose operatic vocals give this album a unique mixture combined with the heavy metal sound.   This album catches your attention right from the opening number, Dark Chest of Wonders,before going into the heavier track, Wish I Had an Angel. It then goes into Nemo, a beautiful and slow building rock ballad which is the song most likely to catch a mainstream audiences's attention. The rest of the songs on this CD are amazing, the standouts being Creek Mary's Blood, Higher than Hope and the epic Ghost Love Score. The Siren is also a personal favorite. Highly reccomended.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|we had to wait 10 minutes for the disc to load on our PS3.    it is on now!  don't go back! or you have to wait again  enjoy!
B000002KNI|1.0|The sound quality of the CD is terrible. It sounds like a homemade cassette tape. The music is plain enough, but it plays much softer than any other CD and sounds like it's coming from cheap speakers.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I have been a comic book fan but never been an Ironman fan. Basically I like the Mr. Miracle, Spiderman type of Super hero.   But this movie is very well made. I am not a Robert Connick Jr fan neither but this has to be his best performance yet. He brings a sense of humor to a character that I did not think had a sense of humor. Unlike other films of these gender the producers tried to make this a believable film like the Japanese Summari Movies. It is still hard to believe that a human in a titanium suit can fly and be more agile than any gymnastic athlete. but then who knows what the future will bring.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I am so glad this is a good CD, it's better than Fantasia cd's.  Every song is great.  Congrats to J.H., if you like this cd you will like Jazmine Sullivan.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|Its 9-30 and Iron Man is OUT on Blu-Ray! What could go wrong?    Oh... DISK 1 FAILS TO LOAD?!?!?! - This is a KNOWN ISSUE...????    [...]    Here is what was said:    \\"  by Wayde Robson -- last modified September 25, 2008 18:28  Iron Man on Blu-ray - May Have Dodged a Missile    In true super-hero style - Iron Man might have narrowly avoided a near disaster. No, it wasn't an explosive missile from his arch-nemesis in the film, Iron Monger played by Jeff Bridges. Instead it was something that could have been devastating for the film's Blu-ray release and possibly delivered a spot of damage to the Blu-ray format overall.     It seems retailers carrying Iron Man on Blu-ray, set for release on Sept. 30, are enduring an eleventh hour recall from Paramount. Considering Iron Man was one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, the splashy special effects film is perfect for Blu-ray's high definition picture quality and Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless audio. It could have been a real set-back for the format itself at this critical juncture as Iron Man could be one of Blu-ray's break-out titles.     Due to an apparent authoring problem with the disc Paramount has recalled the Blu-ray version of Iron Man from retailers. Rumor has it the problem was with disc 1 playing back in certain Sony Blu-ray players.     The studio received reports of compatibility issues with review copies that had been sent out weeks ago. Distributors have only recently been told to send back all copies of the disc. As a result Paramount has stated that it may have to delay the title's release date to October 7.     While a one week delay for the Blu-ray release date may not seem like much, especially after the Godfather Trilogy's release this week - which should keep many BD fans busy, if Paramount decides to go ahead with the DVD release on schedule it will almost certainly hurt Blu-ray sales.     But according to some sources, the word from Paramount is that the studio is working around the clock and determined to meet the official release date of Sept. 30. Some have even reported that they've already received a fixed copy of the Iron Man Blu-ray disc so it looks like old ShellHead might have dodged a damaging projectile that wasn't in the script.\\"    Amazon did an Excellent job in sending out a replacement disk - BUT -  I now fear that any replacement will also have this Issue...  (5 Star Support - Thanks Amazon)      USE CAUTION WHEN YOU BUY THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY!     FYI: I am using a PS3 80GB as my player and online update confirms I have the latest firmware!    Buyer-Be-Ware.

1416524800|2.0|It's an ok beach book. Nothing more.<br />But I agree with many of the criticisms I've read from other reviewers. First, the cardboard characters. Way too politically correct (Villain: white male Republican. Heroine: young, pretty intelligence analyst who outsmarts the male scientists and outfights special forces soldiers. ALternate heroine: young, pretty, black political wonk who outsmarts her aforementioned white male politician boss, and everybody else. With the aid of her female news reporter friend. You go, girls!).<br />Second, Brown alleges that all the technology in the book is real. I'm skeptical about the flying microbot -- at least with the degree of control to fly it into the eye of a person who is moving his head around. Also the rifle that manufactures bullets from snow or sand packed into its handle. Real -- or just on the drawing board? But I outright challenge the idea that there's an F-14 version that can fly 6,000 miles without refueling -- some of that distance on afterburner. And if Brown is not being entirely honest when he says all this is real -- I wonder what it tells me about his assurances that his most famous work also contains true accounts of historical events and organizations?
0425200450|4.0|Murder on the Oriental Express is a fantastic book. It starts out with world famous Hercule Piorot becoming supicious of a young lady who said she was a governess. Piorot tried to book a train, but it was almost entirely filled when at least he got a bunk. Shortly, the train gets stuck on a snowdrift and cannot move for a day or too. However, something of greater worry is that someone has been murdered, and is still on the train.   This wonderful mystery makes you look at every possible clue, every hint, every detail, and there is still no answer. Hercule struggles too, the suspect could be anyone on the train, but then he realizes, maybe the answer is right under his nose.
0743290119|4.0|This book saved me during a 9 hour bus trip.  It was a totally fun, light read, that was very Sex and the City.  I found myself thinking about he characters days after I was finished with the book - I grew attached!  The book is well researched and very current.  I did think that the beginning was slow and the trip to Bonaire could have been a lot funnier.  Some parts were even repetitive (Adriana's beauty).  However, there were many pleasant twists and surprises and I loved the development with the bird!  Overall it was a happy, fun, & light read, and I am happy that I read it!
B000PAAJYW|5.0|it is the bitter end of coffee - it is the twisted dark side of life - it is a masterpiece - I have watched it about a dozen times and everytime it brings home a new meaning. It is probably one of those rare movies where all the actors and actresses gave their life time best performance - specially Tom Cruise. It is about life - it is about our life - it is about my life - we build things and then they fall apart and we cry - we look for help and sometimes we get that help. If you ever have had a tough life then you will find a rare connection with a Hollywood movie and fall in love with it.<br />Strange things happen and they happen in our life and the movie depicts sometimes how all these can happen together - they may not be connected  with a clear thread but there is an underlying sadness which ties them
1596912863|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I had no expectations of a masterpiece and was not disappointed in that respect.  Shannon Hale tells the story of Jane, a closet Mr. Darcy/Colin Firth admirer.  Jane hides her A&E Pride & Prejudice DVD set behind her houseplants so as not to give herself away.  However, her great aunt discovers her secret and forces a confession from her.  Months later the same great-aunt leaves Jane a bequest in her will - an all expenses paid 3-week trip to a Jane Austen fairyland in the English countryside where Jane can totally immerse herself in Austen's time and characters.  Will Jane finally kick her Darcy obsession?  Will she find true love?  Will her bust pop out of the top of those regency dresses?  You'll have to read the book to find out.  This book is well written in a fun, casual style and I enjoyed the whole thing.  It is a fairly quick read, you can probably polish it off in one evening with little effort.

0679746323|5.0|Words cannot convey the magnitude of atrocities against the Chinese people that are described in detail here.  And most of it is still not known in the West.  The author backs up the reporting of every event with two or three sources that were present at the time.  According to the authors of The Black Book of Communism, estimates are now between 60 and 65 million Chinese that died as the direct result of Mao's attempt to create the Chinese version of the \\"New Soviet Man.\\"  The national psychosis of those years will take generations to recover from, olympics or no.
B00000AF95|5.0|Animalize is one of Kiss' most underrated albums.  It is really good.  Gene's songs are alright, Burn Bitch Burn is definitely one of if not the best Gene songs on here.  All of the Paul songs rock hard.  I've Had Enough should have been a single and a big hit.  That song rocks hard.  Mark St. John was fantastic on that song.  Everyone knows Heaven's On Fire is great.  Great, underrated album.

B0010X8NF0|1.0|The experience began like staring at a wall with a mild but relentless toothache and steadily worsened. About halfway through I got up and looked for my revolver. The only way to explain this film is that Wes Anderson, who produced, directed and co-wrote the film, is six years old and not a film prodigy. Although that is rather unkind to six-year olds, who could spin a better story with crayons. In an attempt to mimic the hackneyed plot of pilgrims on a journey, Andersen adds no drama, no adventure, no jokes, and no point. Rumors persist that the film was made as a practical joke on the financial underwriters -- cruel humor indeed.    It the single worst movie I've seen since 1989 when Hollywood featured Kirk (\\"Growing Pains\\") Cameron in it's adventure-thrill-filled homage to the nail-bitingly exciting world of collegiate debating -- released under the ironically non-ironical title \\"Listen to Me,\\" which gives you some idea of the kind of razor-sharp wit employed in that film.
6303402348|1.0|I can't believe that this movie won over The Shawshank Redemption at the Oscars for Best Picture.    This movie is nothing but a box of chocolates loaded with lots of sugar which is bad for you.    For your own good, stay away from this one.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Come watch this movie to learn about the heroes of World War II. They truly are the greatest generation.

0670020745|5.0|What a great story by a wonderful stroke survivor. Just another person who went on to prove medical experts wrong. I too am a survivor and I felt a lot of emotion reading many instances in Jill's story as some things were very similar. This book should be read by medical people.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Before the album came out, expectations generally fell into two camps - the first being that it would be like \\"St. Anger,\\" which many (including me) consider the single worst Metallica album to date, the other saying it would be a return to the style of \\"...And Justice For All.\\" After a few listens, I found it to be neither, but it is a very big step in the right direction.<br /><br />Call me a heretic, but my favorite Metallica album is \\"Load,\\" followed closely by \\"Ride the Lightning.\\" They're about as different as two Metallica albums can be (as long as we're not considering the above-mentioned atrocity \\"St. Anger\\"), and the more I hear \\"Death Magnetic\\" the more I'm thinking of it as a fusion of the two. The actual music - that is, the instruments and beats - feel like the old-school Metallica that we heard in the \\"Ride the Lightning\\"-\\"Master of Puppets\\" era, but the lyrics and some of the minor detailing of the songs feel like they're off of \\"Load.\\"<br /><br />The band plays with the songs, introducing different musical ideas into them. For example, take \\"The Day That Never Comes\\": a melodic, almost calming opening, Hetfield's vocals in the middle, then a blistering instrumental end. Anyone else thinking \\"One\\" here?<br /><br />Another marked improvement over \\"St. Anger\\" is that the album actually flows - even the slow-tempo \\"Unforgiven III\\" feels like it fits.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is Metallica's best album. But it's good, and considering how far they had strayed from what made them popular, this is a nice big step in the right direction, back toward the Metallica we've missed over the past few years.
0385340990|5.0|I will be honest here. I was not enthused about this book at first since it appears to be a series of letters written by several people and I am not a fan of letters. I like to write them and receive them but not reading them as a literary form. I was prepared to set the book aside and tell the people who recommended this book, thanks but no thanks.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I fell in love with all the characters, Juliet, the popular writer living in London, Sidney, her editor, Dawsey the Islander who wrote to Julia first because he acquired one of her Charles Lamb book and they started up a correspondence. That correspondence eventually led her to visit Guernsey Island because of the book club that was formed during the war years. It all started over an illegal pig dinner. The Islanders were breaking the curfew set by the Germans when they were caught leaving a delicious dinner and Elizabeth, a character that we never meet but by through the memories and stories of others, stepped forward with a bold lie saying they were just returning from a book club meeting. As it turns out, books were their salvation during that horrible occupation in World War II.<br /><br />Juliet, enthused by the stories, visited the literary book club and fell in love with all of them. There is Dawsey, a pig farmer, Isola, an eccentric woman who is always searching for new ways to live life, Kit, Elizabeth's daughter, Amelia, Eli, Will and other characters. The main character of each survivor's story is Elizabeth, a woman whose big heart eventually led to her death but somehow her spirit brought them all together and together, they survived one of the worst wars in mankind's history. They all became devoted readers (my favorite kind of people to read about) and they all are devoted to one another.<br /><br />This story, written in the form of letters, is well-told and gives out lots of historical tidbits of which I know next to nothing about. It gives a different perspective of what it is like to be occupied and that even the Germans were starving before they retreated off the island. This is a heartwarming story with heartwrenching moments. It is a book that I will recommend over and over to people ... it is about booklovers and how people survive during the worst of times. It really is perfect for people who wants to know more history and character development. It's not hard to read nor is it dry. It is just a rare gem of a book with great storytelling.<br /><br />10/01/08d that even the Germans were starving before they retreated off the island.

B00002ND77|5.0|Denzel Washington does not disappoint.  At times, I forgot that it was not Malcolm in real life.  The movie was excellent!
B001CO42MU|3.0|THe acting on this movie is great.  But as with any biography<br />the truth often gets far behind.  A large number of people around the REAL<br />coke dealer met unfortunate ends probably at the dope dealers orders or his accomplishes.  You can't be in the hard drug dealing world without<br />deadly violence.<br />But we don't see any of this. In fact a early character is said just to vanish.  Yes. well most likely jung had him killed.  When the late coke addict director of this movie ( he died overdosing on coke) wanted to tell Jungs story he presented a much kinder version of reality than existed.  A true bloody tale would have been more accurate and entertaining but director instead tells us a version of drug dealing that is like a fairy tale in some ways.  That's nothing new for hollywood.<br />Many biographies are so whitewashed that the real person would be amazed that this person on screen is supposed to be him!.  The reality though is that coke and it's children have laid waste to millions of lives and to make a movie that doesn't show this destruction is rather strange. But then the director was a coke addict.  he's dead and long after the real jung is dead the damage he did to the world will be with us. still the movie is entertaining because it has good sctors in it. The blu ray looks great too.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|After the first couple seasons I only watched an occasional episode of the TV series.  A couple of my friends wanted to go to see the movie so we left he kids with our husbands and had a girls night.  I loved the movie so much I bought the DVD when it came out.  The SATC girls have finally grown up and I think it's made them much more interesting.
B0000524CY|5.0|I read the DVD review that stated that the scene between Lt. Kinderman and Fr. Dyer was not in the original film and that devotees of the film found this added scene as altering the film. I saw the film when it was originally released as a college student and the scene was in the original film. When I got my copy of the film when it was first released on VHS the scene was missing. This scene was restored in this version--not added. What I do not remember about the film when it originally played in theaters is whether Father Dyer handed back the medal to Mrs. McNeil or whether it was her just handing it back to him. Sorry, I usually don't write reviews but I couldn't let this error about the Kinderman-Dyer scene go uncorrected.
B000066C1N|4.0|The kids LOVE it.  I searched forever for this and you had it. Thanks!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was told last month (Aug 08) by a friend that I needed to watch this series.  I used Netflix to do so and couldn't get the next disc fast enough.  I was so excited about this show that I had never heard of before that I searched the internet for more info.  It was like when Bart and Milhouse decide to go to the world's fair and find a ghost town because it took place decades earlier.  I was 6 years too late to join in the fight to save the series!  There are so many fans and websites out there still going...I had no idea!<br /><br />This series, like so many other reviewers have said, is human.  It is well written with depth, covering humor, action, drama (great cast chemistry!) and even romance.  Each character has a past, but the crew comes together in a fight for daily survival (by practically any means).  Don't miss this gem...buy the set and support the show!  Who knows, maybe some network will see the light.  Also, don't miss the movie, Serenity, which can be bought here as well - it actually gets the chance to explain a few things and tie up a loose end or two...well, it actually makes a great starting point for another Firefly project (keep your fingers crossed).<br /><br />I did notice that the episodes may not be in the best order, but just what the two hour pilot first and The Message last...it's all good!<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't stand near a huge engine if you want to welch on a deal with Mal!  :)  Browncoats unit!!  (yes, I'm a new 2008 recruite)
0553573411|2.0|Overall the story is a page turner that will have you staying up all night to read.  Characters have a good depth to them; with 5 or 6 with very realistic personalities that will stick with you throughout the story.  The bad guy is a perfect example of a villain that will have you turning page after page to see his demise.      On the other hand this story introduces staggering amount of problems with no resolutions.  The ending is one of the most wretched i have yet to encounter in a trilogy; basically the worse form of a \\"to be continued\\".    The characters have all these amazing powers that develop through the story (char development, key to all great fantasy books), also trained as a assassin.  All of the \\"good\\" chars are supposely the to be fear types that are capable of great feats.  Yet the \\"good\\" characters are completely impotent in using any of there abilities.  The entire story is about them running around and avoiding confrontation for 400+ pages...  Its like a story of complete wimps, the frustration you feel while reading is almost unbearable, many times i thought of putting down the book and picking another author...    I finally get to last chapters, and there is no END!!!!  Just bigger issues are introduced and advertisement for buying the next book.  If you do make the plunge and purchase this book, be sure to buy the third at the same time...      Then ending was so upsetting, i trudged out of my room, downstairs, booted up the ol' puter to write this review...
B00000K31Q|5.0|A movie for teens and adults for sure. My friends and I all love this movie, Heath Ledger (who plays Patrick) is for sure a knockout roll in this film. It's definitely dated, ugly clothing and all, but its cute, and funny, and you'll likely walk away loving every last character in the whole movie. (Even Kat's Pregnet-phobic father!)
B00001QEE9|5.0|disney movies are always good.But in my opinon only the old classics like pinocchio,mouse detective etc. are truly worth watching.Not the junk they have put out in the last 20 yrs.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The second season of the hit TV series Supernatural on DVD does not disappoint.  It takes the viewer on a wild ride through various demons of the supernatural.  The writing and special effects continue to Wow! this season.  The acting is incredible by the two male leads, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who manage to be funny yet credible and are overall a joy to watch act (and of course who are ALWAYS nice to look at).    All 22 episodes are here.  A list follows:    Episode 1 In My Time of Dying An unexpected twist to last year's season finale. YOu will enjoy!!  A great commentary also awaits with voices and  with complex chinese subtitles with Jared, Jensen, and Kim Manners who is the Director of the episode.     Episode 2 Everybody loves a clown  This episode plays into many people's hatred of clowns.  Very eerie for me especially to watch, as I hate clowns.     Episode 3 Bloodlust  A repeat character Gordon is introduced here. The episode is about vampires    Episode 4 Children should not play with dead things.  About life, and death, and more death......    Episode 5  Simon Said  A preview of what will happen with people who are suddenly developing psychic powers (of whom Sam is one)    Episode 6  No Exit  The ghost of a real life serial killer returns to harm his old haunts.      Episode 7 The usual suspects  Dean's past comes back to haunt him in this episode.      Episode 8 Crossroad blues  Dean and Sam investigate an area where supposily one can make deals with the devil.    Episode 9 Croatoan  A virus affects a small town.  VEry unsettling end.     Episode 10 Hunted  Gordon returns, hunting after Sam, due to his psychic abilities.    Episode 11 Playthings  Invisible playmates may be demonic as demonstrated by this episode.  And I had no idea that my imaginary friend \\"Hermie\\" when I was growing up could be like this!! I guess I was lucky.    Episode 12  Nightshifter  More shapeshifting fun.    Episode 13 Houses of the holy  Sam feels he has been \\"touchedby an angel.\\"      Episode 14  Born under a bad sign  Sam's dark side may have emerged in this episode about his lost week    Episode 15  Tall Tales  There is nothing like a \\"trickster\\" spirit to rustle up things at a University.    Episode 16 Roadkill  Roadkill is about ghostkill (big surprise with a show that has the name of \\"Supernatural\\")    Episode 17  Heart  Werewolves aplenty in this episode.    Episode 18  Hollywood Babylon  Ghostly happenings on a Hollywood horror movie set.    Episode 19 Folsom Prison Blues  Dean goes to jail in this episode (and presumably did not pass go, or collect his 200.00.  I just hope he did not bend over for a bar of soap.).    Episode 20  What is and what should never be  A genie grants a wish for Dean.  Includes a commentary with the creator of the show Eric Kripke    Episode 21  All Hell Breaks Loose Part 1  The psychic kids meet, the start of mass destruction.  Good commentary (again with complex chinese subtitiles if you want that ) by Eric Kripke, Robert Singer the Director of the episode and Sera Gamble the writer.     Episode 22  All Hell Breaks Loose Part 2  Big consequences for Dean as the finale of this season concludes, and really gets you ready for season 3.....    I can't tell you how much I am enjoying the Supernatural television series.  Everything else on this DVD is great as well.  The two documentaries \\"The Devil's Road Map\\" and \\"The Episode from Hell: the making of all Hell Breaks Loose Part 2\\" are very informative and entertaining.  Most of all I enjoyed the Gag real.  Buy it, you'll like it!  I can't wait to watch Season 3, recently released on DVD.
B00004U8H4|4.0|This movie shows violence toward women, men and the narrow escape of a kitten from an ATM machine.      Ahhhhhhh!  What can I say?  Christian Bale is an incredible actor and his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in \\"American Psycho\\" is unforgettable.  Bale's Patrick Bateman is drop-dead gorgeous, cut, successful, swaggering, demented, obsessed and, of course, p-s-y-c-h-o. And comedic in a very, very dark way.  His livingroom scene with Jared Leto (his nemesis in the movie) is so disturbing you DO indeed catch yourself grinning.  Patrick's obsession with Jared Leto's character AND business cards, helps the viewer understand that Patrick is not just insanely jealous -- he IS insane.    Women in this movie are just meat for Patrick's grinder.  He enjoys killing.  Women are easy to kill.  He has easy access to women so, hey, why not slaughter them?  The types of women he attracts are apparently  as shallow as he is with the exception of the street prostitute who you will probably feel sympathy for.      If anyone begins this movie envying or admiring Patrick Bateman and still does at the end of the movie, I would suggest they too are crazy.  Patrick is probably every human being's worst nightmare.  The guy takes himself and his position in life WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.  He indulges his every desire (mostly sadistic).  He is a leech.  A vampire.  He takes and gives nothing back.  You can knock on his door and nobody's home.  He is  only happy in someone else's skin.    This movie is violent and has disturbing elements but it is very well acted by Bale.  I would agree this is a dark comedy and recommend it for its entertainment value.
031606792X|5.0|Excellent book, only sad to see the story end. This saga is well worth the $ to add to your collection is romance and vampires are your genre. The book might seem long at over 700 pages, but honestly it didn't feel long enough. I can reread this book and the rest of the saga again and again and still feel the love of the characters so well written it makes it hard to believe its not real.
B001CZJKS0|1.0|What is the point of just releasing what has already been released? The only thing that is new here is the extended edition of Halloween.  To Anchor Bay, when are the special, or Divimax, editions, of Curse Of, H20, & Resurrections, coming out?
B001D08SK0|4.0|Everyone who loves good jazz or music in general will know this album,so just a quick note on the quality of the discs.  Perhaps I was lucky but my three discs were all right.  The DVD had a slight mark in one spot,however it too was ok.  The audio discs were fine.  However I can't believe that the brains at Sony couldn't find a better way to package the three discs,instead of slipping them bare into a half cardboard sleeve.  My 180 gram vinyl record was also in good shape.  I have transferred the three discs into traditional plastic cases for protection.  The book is very handsome and is well done.  The poster is ok-nothing to get excited over.  The photo reprints are nice as is the copy of the hand written album notes by Bill Evans.  I still think this set is a bit on the expensive side,considering that this album has reaped a ton of profit.  For Davis and jazz collectors it will be a \\"must buy\\".  For everyone else,maybe the price will come down in the future.
B000G73UEU|5.0|I am, but you don't have to be a Leonard Cohen fan to find \\"I Am Your Man\\" moving, soul touching, and inspirational.  An ensemble of outstanding talents join together to pay tribute to Cohen's genius; in the process they create an album that ranks among the very best I've ever heard.  The final track alone, with U2 backing Cohen, makes the album worth owning.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Normally I wouldn't watch such a movie, but I did. There are many themes layered throughout this movie that you could pull apart and inspect, or ignore, depending on your view. You could fixate yourself on the S&M aspect and be blind to everything else, unable to look past the red-rears and handcuffs.<br /><br />I saw this movie as about a woman discovering who she is in a world she never knew existed. Yes, James Spader's character is a bit odd, dominating her with almost Nazi-like authority. But the girl holds herself, finding out how strong she really is and how much she can endure. It's about discovering what really drives you forward and makes you who you are. It's about being able to look passed what society thinks as normal and create your own world with your own rules.<br /><br />The movie started a bit slow, then gradually picked up momentum. By the end I was so pulled into it I wanted more. A short \\"making of\\" segment and trailer are the only special features on this DVD. Not much else, but then again I couldn't imagine what more could be added.<br /><br />Overall a great movie, fun for the whole family...especially the kids!!
B001GAPC1K|1.0|Disc 1 wouldn't play on my PS3.  I submitted a return through amazon (which is a really simple process).  I hope the replacement I'm being sent works, but judging by what I've read online, I shouldn't hold my breath!!    **update - I received a replacement from amazon the next day, and it worked perfectly.  thanks amazon!!
B000KQGP2G|5.0|When I first listened to Scarsick, I enjoyed it, but it didn't really sink in or have quite as much of an effect on me as previous albums from Pain of Salvation.  I didn't quite get the story at first, and I couldn't understand what this had to do with The Perfect Element.  All that is there, but it's hidden beneath the surface of the songs.    The album details the background of the \\"he\\" character from The Perfect Element.  It is less of a narrative and more of a description of the environment which shaped the person.  The whole first half of the album is about materialism, greed, using women as object.  When you start thinking of the character that played out in the Perfect Element, the songs fit him perfectly.  You begin to understand his motivations in the story that unfolds in the previous album.    Musically, the songs are much more simple and straightfoward than most of Pain of Salvation's previous works.  To me, this was purposeful.  My understanding of the album is that it is not only a description of the environment for the \\"he\\" character, but also commentary on the world right now.  What better way to make this kind of comment than by parodying the popular culture of the times?  Additionally, the themes present throughout The Perfect Element are repeated (albeit with extreme changes in the sound) throughout Scarsick.  To get the full effect of the album, listen to it immediately following a listen to The Perfect Element.  You'll be surprised how much is hidden in a song as simple sounding as Cribcaged.
0374531269|5.0|This was a very heart wrenching book.  A recommend for everyone so people are made aware of the atrocities of war.  Even thought you are made aware of the terrible situations you understand how people cope in how ever bizarre a manner.
1401308201|4.0|As far as photobook tie-ins for fans of musicals go it's hard to imagine a better or more informative book. There are multiple interviews with many members of the different casts of \\"Wicked\\" (US, London, and touring), plus many photos of the different metropolitan productions, and in-depth looks at the beautiful props, sets, and costumes that did so much towards making the show a success. And there are many superb interviews with the creative team that put the show together that give you a good sense of the give-and-take that went on in putting it all together. There's also a useful glossary of terms if you're not as familiar with the books by L. Frank Baum and Gregory Maguire the musical bases itself upon.
B00005JLSE|5.0|That's right, Zuper! Zuper! Richard Gere was great as the manipulative, money-hungry, publicity-grabbing laywer Billy Flynn working to get Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) off of a murder charge. John C. Reilly's \\"Cellophane Man\\" was surprisingly entertaining. Along with of course, Richard Gere's great \\"puppet man\\" scene.<br /><br />But Zellweger really steals the show. Well, along with Zeta-Jones' super performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones with a real \\"triple-threat\\" performance (like that of Zellweger) really helped put this movie over the top. What a pair of bombshells. The Duo's closing number is awesome. Super choreography throughout the entire movie.
031606792X|1.0|I devoured the first 3 books in the series and couldn't wait to read book 4.  What a disappointment!!! It was almost comical and ridiculous to read. Unfortunately once I begin a book I need to finish it, only to find out how the story ends so I had to force myself to finish the book.  Yuck, utterly disappointing!!!!!
0385338694|4.0|I liked this book very much, but will not give it 5 stars because in my opinion it pales to Kinsellas wonderful Shopaholic books and the glorious Becky Bloomwood.  I did think that this story was fun and cute and just what I was looking to read, once again Sophie Kinsella does not disappoint.  I love her work.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Marvel Comics, like it's counterpart nemesis DC, has had it's share of hits and misses when it comes to translating it's superhero catalog to the big screen. While successes like Spider-Man and XMen tore it's way to the top with ease, there's also the ones that got clobbered like The Punisher and the first attempt at Hulk in 2003. But with CGI technology reaching closer heights than ever before, now Hollywood has the ability to truly turn those ink and color panels to life, and no opportunity has been better received than with Iron Man.<br /><br />Tony Stark is basically a war profiteer that he and his company Stark Industries creates and manufacturers weapons so the good ole USA can win in a variety of battles, and in these reflective times, the battle currently is in the Middle East. When he himself is captured during a weapons demonstration that leaves numerous deadly pieces of shrapnel permanently close to his heart, he and a fellow scientific prisoner implant a device in his chest to keep them from reaching that area & in return becomes a major power source. When the captors want Stark to create an ultimate bomb, Stark turns the tables and creates a bodysuit of armor to escape and in return he realizes that he cannot go on in building weapons that usually just falls in the wrong hands, and unknowingly to Stark, by his business partner whose only concern is the almighty dollar and Tony's demise. So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.<br /><br />Let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast. Robert Downey Jr not only looks the part of Tony Stark, but with his natural ego-driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role. Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head & beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace. There's really not a weak link in the bunch. As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here. Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid-looking steel and because of that fact can be replicated much better without any doubt if the object is really on the screen or not. Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.<br /><br />Even though this review is for the single-disc edition, Paramount still gives you quite a value here than just a typical bare-bones disc. With a film presentation that has one of the best looking and sounding standard definition combos I've ever seen, they also include on it over twenty-four minutes of extended & deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut. There's even an Easter Egg hidden here maybe giving you a preview of what extras the 2 discer might have in store for you. So for fans on a limited income, or those that just want the movie, you won't go wrong by buying the smaller content version. While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.<br /><br />Overall this was a great origin superhero film that didn't drag one bit within it's 2 hours and 2 minutes. Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future. And unlike The Dark Knight, that took itself way too seriously, Iron Man still mentions problematic issues concerning war today and thrilling us all along the way.<br /><br />P.S.: The two-disc version has extensive behind the scenes and interviews with the film's cast and crew that in my opinion could have brought my rating a good half point or moreif that was the version I chose to see as of this writing.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)s of this writing.  (RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica is still the best.  This goes back to old school heavy metal.  I am very happy with this CD, first CD of any kind we have bought in a long time.  I did notice the distortion problem that another reviewer mentioned.
037582913X|5.0|When I was little this was my favorite book.  We would read it over and over, and I would pretend I was struggling to turn the pages that Grover had tied, nailed, and bricked over.    So when we had a daughter, this was one of the first books I bought for her.  At 2 years old the book sat on the shelves for a while, but she is 3 now, and I recently took it down again to read for her at bedtime.  It is now a favorite, we read it every night.  I read the pages, then she turns them to give poor old Grover a hard time.  One recommendation...this review is for the standard Little Golden Books version, which is great, but we also found a board book version in stores, so the hard pages are great when you have toddlers turning the pages for you every night.  They can really 'struggle' against Grover's efforts without hurting the book.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I rented Iron Man on DVD yesterday, and I had a chance to check it out last night. I had high expectations for this film---I expected more, a lot more, a hell of a lot more. Okay, it was a summer movie. Critics raved so much over Iron Man that I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />My first gripe against Iron Man was the time it took to get to the action: about 40 minutes. There was too much exposition before the actual fireworks, and those fireworks were over in a blink. My second gripe against Iron Man was its conflict: weapons save lives, and weapons take lives. I wasn't expecting a brain-f**k, but I was expecting something more sophisticated. My third gripe against Iron Man was Gwyneth Paltrow. She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her.<br /><br />On the plus side, Robert Downey Jr. invests more personality in a superhero than I am used to seeing. He plays the cold arrogant billionaire role with ease. Downey plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who's the antithesis of everything heroic. Tony grew up as a child prodigy. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, he built his first engine. At age seventeen, he graduated from MIT. And as CEO of the largest and wealthiest defense contractor in the world, Tony Stark has zero morals. He gambles, he drinks, he's irresponsible, and he's a womanizer.<br /><br />Tony pitches a new missile system, the Jericho, to the military in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. There, a band of terrorists hijack Tony's Humvee. The terrorists overwhelm Tony's military entourage. The confrontation is furious and swift. Hours later, Tony awakens in a dark cave. His body is wet with sweat and blood, his clothes are torn, and he has a huge plug--an electromagnet--protruding out of his chest. This magnet keeps him alive by pulling the shrapnel embedded his chest away from his heart. Earlier, during the terrorist siege, an exploding bomb splintered and planted those splinters in Tony's chest.<br /><br />The terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater. Then they show him why they kidnapped him in the first place. They lead him out of the dark cave and into the light. Tony sees an enormous cache of stockpiled weapons--weapons manufactured by his company. The terrorists stockpile these weapons to use against American soldiers. Now the terrorists want Tony's help: they want Tony to build the Jericho missile system for them to use against American soldiers. The terrorists promise to release Tony if he cooperates. But Tony has other ideas. He builds an armored battle-suit equipped with flame-throwers. He escapes.<br /><br />Back home in the U.S., the press mobs Tony. He's sober.  He saw terrorists use his weapons to kill American soldiers; now, he wants to shut down the weapons development division of his company. He wants to use his company to make the world a better place. Tony's plans embitter his guardian and vice president Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has his sights set on selling the Jericho missile system to the U.S. government. The action starts from this point of the movie.<br /><br />Like Batman, Iron Man has no natural powers; this implies that some heroes are made. The exterior insulation of Tony Stark's vanity and ego are the perfect counterpoint to Iron Man's cold titanium shell. Overall, Iron Man's a solid movie. It's worth buying, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's Robocop.<br /><br />Author of [[ASIN:0759609942 Gotta Be Down!]]he terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater.

Yes they did take a few liberty's but it's Hollywood what do you expect.<br /><br />I think that Robert Downey Jr. was a good choice I just hope that he can stay out of trouble long enough to make the sequel they left the movie open for.

B00005N5S5|5.0|Some films age like wine: the older they get, the better they get. It's hard to believe that the Terminator's pushing 25 years old. Terminator's lean script, staccato editing and direction, and its human driven storyline are what allows it to survive amongst modern films that benefit from superior technologies like CGI, motion capture, and now 3D-motion photography. Everything's relative and, in 1984, Terminator's special effects were extraordinary.  For instance, there's a scene in a motel where the Terminator attends to some gunshot wounds he suffered. Using a box-knife, he opens a vaginal gash on his forearm to readjust a broken piston rod.  Then, he stabs the box-knife into his eyeball and plucks the soft gelatin organ out of his head. In the ragged and empty mouth of his eye-socket, a hard shiny light zooms in and out. This was scary back in 1984. Today, a five-year old could see through these transparent effects.<br /><br />Distilled to its essence, the Terminator is a cyborg from the future that travels back in time--forty years--to kill a woman, a waitress, whose unborn son will save mankind in near the future. This is the magic of the Terminator: it's a human story.  The action, the special effects, the camerawork, the actors---the special effects in Terminator takes a back seat to its human storyline.<br /><br />Terminator is James Cameron's best movie. It has the perfect atmosphere; most of the action is at night. The big `70's cars in the Terminator's chase sequences are reminiscent of the big cars in The French Connection's chase sequences.  Unlike T2, where there's a lot of exposition between action scenes, Terminator's action scenes erupt out of nowhere. I could go on and on but the bottom line is that Terminator will be around long after most of today's science fiction rip-offs are obsolete.<br /><br />author of [[ASIN:0759609942 Gotta Be Down!]]

B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium's Shogun is one hell of a cd. Anyone who says otherwise are just fooling themselves. I'll agree with another reviewer. You take the progression of \\"The Crusade\\", the power of \\"Ascendancy\\" and the rawness of \\"Ember To Inferno\\" and you have the very awesome \\"Shogun\\". Not overly produced, great riffs, wicked drums, varying vocals and well written tracks. I cannot fault this album, very highly recommended to any metal fan (all genres within)who has any idea what this kind of music is all about.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Introducing a new James Bond:  Daniel Craig.  The story line is old and has even been spoofed by Woody Allen in a film of the same name. The  question remains, How do you train a person to be a sanctioned assain?  Watch this film and you will be surprised at what it takes to gain the  double O designation.  Judi Dench plays Bond's boss and portrays this  position with her usual panacity to give a true performance.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Finally....mature music for us grown folks!  It seems like today's standard for the music industry is love, sex, and money...and if you are not singing about it, showing it, or cussing it then its a \\"flop\\".     I bought Jennifer's CD yesterday, I have had it in heavy rotation ever since, and I can say that I like it.  Its not a \\"hip hop\\" party album, its more relaxed, candle lit, \\"me\\" time music.  The colabs with Ludacris, T-Pain, and Fantasia are great!  I respect all types of music, and I appreciate the fact that we have new artist (Jennifer Hudson, Jazmine Sullivan) who are making good old fashion Love and Life music without all that loud background music and naked dancers; please...we get that all the time these days.  And for those who don't like the fact she put a gospel song on the end of this album, I think it was very much applicable considering she is a \\"church girl\\".  And to me, she sings the gospel song better than any cut on her album because thats who she is!  The only reason I am rating this album a 4 and not a 5 is the fact I think she is missing a good one or two more up beat songs.      In addition, I respect singers who can give you REAL vocals on \\"live\\" performances and not singing on top of tracks as the new hit makers are doing these days.  I think about our living legends such as Gladys Knight, Patti Labelle, and Betty Wright, just to name a few, who didn't know what a track was back in the day.  They took that microphone and wore it out everytime whether hoarse or in good voice.  So I can appreciate a artist such as Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce, Jazmine Sullivan who can give you the same sound on \\"live\\" performances as their albums. So if you are looking for mature music and mature vocals, this is a must have!

0765350386|4.0|Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson is an excellent fantasy novel that was hard to put down. I, like many others, wanted to see what the author who was going to finish Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series was all about. I have to say he didn't dissapoint.<br /><br />Excellent read. I couldn't put the book down. What makes this book so successful IMOP is the history. History is essential to any good fantasy story and its impact on the characters in the present is what drives the story.<br /><br />If you want an enjoyable, fast paced, and \\"new\\" epic fantasy you need to read this novel. Read Elantris as well. Fantastic!
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book. The story is so original and interesting. I definitely recommend if you enjoyed The Host by Stephanie Meyer. Suzanne Collins' future is so detail, I felt like I was there. Hoping for a sequel!!
B0019T9FL6|3.0|Ever since the release of the ultra-successful The Emancipation of MiMi, by Mariah Carey, it seems as though record labels are constantly overthinking things in order to get hits, especially when they have an artist who is truly talented on their hands, like Jennifer Hudson. That would probably explain why the best song Jennifer Hudson has ever recorded, the lovely \\"Stand Up,\\" is nowhere to be found here. Quite honestly, this is not the classic album I was expecting from such a talented woman. Still, there are some nice songs. \\"Spotlight\\" is probably the best thing on here; it's light, but forceful, and its sparse production leaves ample room for Jennifer's powerful and emtional vocal delivery. The Timbaland-produced \\"Pocketbook\\" is pretty much the only moment on the album where she doesn't take herself so seriously, which makes it refreshing. It's sassy and silly (\\"don't make me hit you with my pocketbook\\"), but the track is almost ruined by Ludacris' unnecessarily nasty rap. The Robin Thicke-penned \\"Giving Myself,\\" a simple and beautiful ballad, was a nice choice. The piano-laden \\"My Heart\\" is very catchy and an overall nice mid-tempo. \\"I'm His Only Woman,\\" a duet with Fantasia, pays homage to Stax-era soul. \\"We Gon' Fight\\" is standard Tank fare, but it's enjoyable. And the closer, a rendition of the gospel traditional \\"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There,\\" shows her vocals at their best. The rest of the songs, I'm afraid, are anything but satisfying and many of them are extremely trendy, meaning that there are songs all across the radio that sound similar. Luckily, Hudson's voice elevates all of these from being embarrassingly bad, except on the biggest monstrosity: the duet with... T-Pain, \\"What's Wrong (Go Away).\\" 'Nuff said, it's inexcusible. \\"If This Isn't Love\\" is a bit too pop for my tastes. I can't believe artists are still calling up Diane Warren for songs, because in my opinion, she was finished almost a decade ago. Anyways, her addition, \\"You Pulled meThrough\\" is pretty uninspiring. \\"Can't Stop the Rain\\" has a generally nice melody and has touching lyrics, but the production is very stale. \\"Invisible\\" isn't very exciting, either, and the chorus is too dramatic. And the inclusion of \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\" was pretty unnecessary in my eyes, especially since I--and probably the rest of America--had grown tired of it by the time the Academy Awards came around. Contrary to what other reviewers are saying, \\"All Dressed Up In Love\\" is not included as a bonus track on the standard edition. As I said before, all this material is made better due to the simple fact that it's Jennifer Hudson singing, and there are six or seven good tracks. But there are just as many songs that should've been left off, and with over 40 tracks recorded for this album, you'd think Hudson and Clive Davis could've formulated a great tracklist. If you want an excellent new female R&B album, buy Jazmine Sullivan's Fearless, because this just isn't cutting it for me. Maybe next time.

1582701709|5.0|I have read several motivational books but I got more than motivation from The Secret.  The message is about how our thoughts affect the outcome of our lives.  The book provided examples of thought creating results.  The notion of \\"As we think, we are\\" is very well presented and reinforced.
0757302661|5.0|I have trained in clinical hypnosis at my medical school and seen first hand what amazing things can be accomplished.  For anyone not sold on the Mongan method of Hypnobirthing my recommendation is to get a consultation with a Hypnobirthing provider before writing it off.      The efficacy of hypnosis in medicine has been established for over 50 yrs.  The hypnotic language in the book is perfect and well communicated. However, I can see how those who haven't witnessed the effects of hypnosis might find it unbelievable. I originally took the course in hypnosis just because I didn't believe it was real or possible. I was dumbfounded by what I witnessed and became a \\"believer\\".      Hypnosis utilizes a strong mind-body connection that we cannot scientifically understand right now.  However, there is a significant amount of reputable, NIH-funded research supporting pain perception being regulated by emotional context and expectations. We might not be able to say exactly how thinking certain thoughts inhibit or stimulate the release of certain neurotransmitters, but we know for sure its happening and it explains a lot of what happens when hypnobirthing mothers have surges (hypnobirthing language for contraction) and yet feel comfortable.    Hypnobirthing is a tool to achieve a positive outcome.  For those mothers and fathers who are willing to invest the time to prepare for a Hypnobirthing birth by practicing Mongan's method, they will be well rewarded.  This isn't something where you have to believe it for it to work.  Unlike placebo, all you have to do is follow her method and practice diligently. Your body will remember when the time comes.    The medical community used to doubt the efficacy of doulas (a person who provides emotional, psychological, and physical support during labor). Now there is scientifically sound evidence documenting that the presence of a doula shortens labor significantly.  It is only a matter of time before the use of the mind-body connectionin birth is better recognized by the mainstream medical community.  In the meantime, you can still use it to improve your birthing experience. If you want to learn the skills to use that mind-body connection, the Mongan method of Hypnobirthing is an excellent option and I highly recommend it.
B000816TCY|4.0|My daughter has a Coolpix s52, and the original battery works great.  Problem is, it lasts so long, it's easy to forget to charge it before heading out for a day of picture-taking, and I certainly don't like charging a half-charged battery.  Bought a spare, problem solved.  The spare holds a charge well and we swap back and forth when the primary battery poops out.  It's true, generic batteries are cheaper, and I wish the Nikon battery wasn't so pricey, but still would buy it every time rather than risk it.
B001CISHU4|5.0|I have always considered Metallica as my overall favorite band (yes this is an Amon Amrth review).  Then there has been the last 15 years and my confidence in my favorite band choice has been tarnished.  The \\"Black\\" album was the twilight and the subsequent years brought only darkness and despair.  There has recently been light again with \\"Death Magnetic\\" but let's get back to the twilight.    A few years ago I began expanding my metal horizons and discovered bands like Ensiferum, Turisas, Einherjer, Unleashed, Wintersun and Tyr to name just a few.  Somewhere between Ensiferum and Turisas I picked up the album \\"Fate of Norns\\" by Amon Amarth (translated as Mount Doom for all you Tolkien fans).  Now, I am of Norwegian heritage, and vikings hold a special place in my heart.  \\"Fate of Norns\\" blew me away.  It perfectly combined my love of all things metal and my love of all things viking.  I had found the perfect band.  I had to check out their previous work...    It turns out that \\"Fate of Norns\\" was the fifth full length album our friends from Sweden had released.  Their previous efforts, \\"Once Sent From the Golden Hall\\", \\"The Crusher\\", \\"The Avenger\\" and \\"Versus the World\\" beckoned me.  The first three albums were more stright forward death metal with a hint, here and there, of what was to come.  \\"Versus the World\\" saw a change in the band, with a much more melodic texture over the double bass, pounding death metal machine underneath.  It is also where Johan Hegg, the bands prodigiously bearded lead singer, hit his stride.  Hegg is, quite frankly, amazing.  I have failed to find another lead with such a powerful, growling voice who you can actually understand!  Every freakin' word, clear as a bell, well at least to a semi-trained ear!  So, I was hooked.  \\"Versus the World\\" was even better then \\"Fate of Norns\\" and I began to wait for their next release...    In 2006 Amon Amarth released \\"With Oden on Our Side\\" to the world.  To say the least, I was not disappointed.  It was, I believe, better then \\"Fate of Norns\\" and in some ways better than \\"Versus the World\\".  So, now here is a band that I have elevated to near the top of my all time favorite bands list and I read that they have signed a new three album deal.  I start to worry.  Is it the beginning of a sellout?  There are guest appearances on the new album.  Uh oh.  They announce a special addition of \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" with a comic book and bobble head dolls.  I start to panic!  I want them to be more popular (in the U.S.) but will they just release garbage from here on out?  It has happened to my favorite band before.....    ...and then I hear the new album.  Phew!!!  It is a masterpiece!!!  It is the band's best album of the seven they have now released.  It has mid-tempo melodic tracks, specifically \\"Varyags of Miklagaard\\", \\"Free Will Sacrifice\\" and \\"Live for the Kill\\".  The title track is brutal and has a short but outstanding guitar solo by Children of Bodom guitarist Roope Latvala.  \\"Guardians of Asgaard\\" will stick in your head, well, for a long, long time.  You could lead an army into battle with \\"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\\".  And then there is \\"Where is your God?\\".  Here you cannot really understand Mr. Hegg.  But all is forgiven because Amon delivers almost four minutes of pure, unadulterated viking brutality!  The first time I heard it I shed a tear, a tear of joy for it is truly hardcore (\\"Asator\\" on crack).    So, Amon Amarth delivered.  Their string of awesomeness is unbroken.  I will now enjoy an even larger library of melodic, brutal viking death metal.  And then I will wait.  Wait with apprehension for their next album.  Will they pull it off again?  I believe they have the gods on their side.  If you have any interest at all in death metal, melodic death metal, metal, vikings, head banging, moshing, etc. you owe it to yourself to at least try listening to Amon Amarth.  I guarantee you will find something you like.    Hail to the mighty AmonAmarth!
B001CISHU4|5.0|As with all previous Amon Amarth albums, this album takes what has been done in previous albums and adds some great new elements for a brand new experience.  Much more could be said about this evolution of a great band but listen for yourself and BUY THE DAMN ALBUM!  This album is highly recommended for any fan of Amon Amarth or Battle Metal in general.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|I too experienced problems with the initial load problem.  I found that if you eject the disc (but don't remove it from the PS3) then turn off the unit - you can then turn it back on and it will load and play.  I discovered this quite by accident.  I was disappointed that I would have to wait for a new disc.  I tried cycling the power and discovered that it played.  I was able to see the movie, but I'll have to exchange the disc for a \\"fixed\\" one.    I wonder how the BD-Live content will be once I'm able to view it?    The graphics/composition of the menus is very cool - the best I've seen in a sci-fi disc.  -  Cheers & Good luck, Brian
0307276902|5.0|I wanted to send an inspiring story to someone I'm trying to mentor from a distance.  He's in an Arizona prison where he's spent a fair amount of the last 20 years for non-violent criminal offenses.  To preview it, I got a copy from my local small town library.  I knew of the book and the Oprah controversy. However the last book I read was Frey's \\"Bright Shiny Morning\\" which  touched me in many ways.   So when I picked up \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", a young employee gave it a bad review. She didn't like the language-lots of the f word- and could not get into it. I told her my reasons to read it and she thought that perhaps someone in the prison population that had a history of drug addiction and criminal behavior could benefit from Frey's story.       Verdict is still out on that one.  I purchased it Aug 26 and last I heard my mentee still had not received it.  Apparently they have some difficulty receiving things, even books from Amazon, in prison. So his review is the one we need to have as he has a bit in common with James Frey and lots not so much.      I liked this book.  I learned more about alcohol and drug addiction. It may have been embellished but it wasn't sanitized.  This is from a perspective of someone who went out of control early in life and the consequences of that behaviour.  As in so many of these stories, James Frey came from a \\"privleged family\\" -this is what I call families whose parents are educated, successful in society and have way more wealth than most families.   My mentee didn't travel that path.  I hope he can identify with some of this. I hope he can also figure out how to stay off drugs. His future in life may literally depend on it.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|The movie soundtrack is cleaner and allows the actors to hit/round their notes. Pierce Brosnan strains too much but, is probably the only low point in the version.  I've the Broadway CD and ABBA's greatest hits.  The movie soundtrack is up to date and tells the story.    Best option between the 3.  Close second is the ABBA originals, but, the original's tempo is out of date.
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|Excellent remastering. A great album. I waited for CCR to remaster their albums and finally they did! I bought all six re-issues. Sound and package are great. Although as I type this I only listened to this album. Love the bonus tracks. What an album.
B0014KD46W|4.0|There are some fantastic songs on these cd but there are some repetitious ones that i could live without . I give it 4 stars because the fantastic songs are worth listening , even that this is the most Eric Clapton composition style Steve has written . Buy a used cd so you wount feel so bad that only the first 5 songs are worth it ...  Common Stevie , 2 cds to make one ? . I mean It´s about Time and 9 Lives could be a really good one ... I will wait for Comming of Age ...

B001DDBCUU|5.0|SEX AND THE CITY THE MOVIE SPECIAL EDITION won't satisfy all of the fans of the show. You either love it or hate it. Sure the movie had its pitfalls like the \\"will Big & Carrie marry or is this the final break-up?\\" etc., but for the most part it gives us fans one last hurrah. I guess the movie could be seen as the cherry on top of an already luscious and decadent sundae.<br /><br />Did we need the movie? Probably not, but I'm glad the powers that be decided to make it. And just like that cherry, the movie is just a lovely garnish that topped off a really wonderful television series.<br /><br />Here's what's on the SATCTM DVD Sp. Ed.:<br /><br />DVD #1<br />***Extended Version of the movie--(Run Time 151 mins)--I think the extended scenes show Carrie, Charlotte, Harry and Lily on Halloween (I don't remember that scene in the movie)<br /><br />***Commentary By Director/Writer Michael Patrick King<br /><br />DVD #2<br />***Digital Copy of the Movie--To play on computer/ipods etc., w/out dvd<br /><br />***Conversation W/Sarah Jessica Parker & MPK--24-minute featurette with director MPK and star SJP discussing various scenes<br /><br />***The Fabulous Fashion Of SATC--18-minute Featurette with Costume Designer Patricia Field(who should win the Academy Award)--takes viewers on a behind-the-scenes of the fab wardrobe, shoes, bags and jewelery used in the movie and includes shots of the cast while filming<br /><br />***Additional Scenes w/director commentary--Four additional scenes not in the movie or extended cut and MPK discusses each one<br /><br />***Additional Scenes w/out commentary--the four above scenes w/out MPK<br /><br />***Fergie In The Studio--Two-minute thing w/Fergie and the recording session for the song \\"Labels or Love\\" for the soundtrack<br /><br />All in all a pretty good DVD set for fans of both the show and the movie. Seeing it the second time around, I do see things that I missed when seeing it in the theater. One of them being the over riding theme of \\"Cinderella.\\" But, the friendship between the four women is still what makes SATC/SATCTM so special...at least to me.ecial...at least to me.
B001CIPU3G|4.0|Have to say, this is a great album.  This isn't going to be a Crusade bash, because I thought that album was a great piece of work.  Yes, we get it...the Metallica references which have less validity in it then people really can tell.  Anyway, From Ember to Inferno we go to Ascendancy which was just a big step forward in technicality and all around musicianship.  Then we go to the Crusade which was a big side step, but not a step backwards.  In its own regards, the sound of the Crusade is great.  Then we go to Shogun...fantastic album...and if they were to cut that 11 minute trainwreck the finalizes the cd, this would be that much better...

B0017I1FNK|4.0|I've always had a great admiration for Emmylou Harris as an artist but I couldn't really call myself a true fan of hers, that is until the release of her 1995 album \\"Wrecking Ball\\" in which she transcends the previous limits of country music into something new altogether. I've loved every one of her albums since then, and it's been a long five years since her previous studio album \\"Stumble Unto Grace\\".<br /><br />\\"All I Intend To Be\\" (13 tracks; 56 min.) came as somewhat of a surprise to me, as Emmylou reaches back into more of her traditional country roots than she has done in the last 15 years. This becomes somewhat apparent on the opener \\"Shores of White Sand\\", even more so on \\"Moon Song\\", and the most of all on songs like \\"Old Five and Dimers Like Me' and \\"\\"Kern River\\", which are not for me,but that's just my personal taste. There are 2 songs co-written and featuring Kate and Ann McGarrigle that are quite enjoyable. Emmylou Harris brings another 4 songs written by her, and they are mostly tremendous. Apart from the music, Emmylou's voice remains as warm and as rich, and in fact seems to be getting better still.<br /><br />Hard to believe that Emmylou turned 61 this year. While I have to admit that \\"All I Intend To Be' is not my favorite Emmylou Harris album, this is a nice album nevertheless. If Emmylou tours anywhere close to Cincinnati behind this album, you can bet I will be there. I've seen her a number of times of the years, and she is outstanding live.
0375826726|5.0|I've been waiting for Brisingr since I've read Eldest and I must say I'm very satisifed. Most people complain that Paolini borrows from other works, but then who doesn't? One must recall he started writing at fifteen. It's hard not to be over-influenced at that age. Things he borrowed have evolved into something else, in other words Paolini has improved them in every book, and the latest one is just better.    Paolini is still switching from Eragon to Roran, and this time he switches more smoothly. Sometimes in Eldest, Paolini just cut through important scenes to show Roran or vice versa. This does not happen in Brisingr, the important scenes continue and nobody gets too much 'page-time.' We also get into the heads of Nasuada, and also Saphira. It's obvious that Paolini did his best to make dragons perceive everything differently and they do. I'm not perfectly happy with how they perceive certain things (like humans: round-ears-two-legs.) It makes them seem simple. However Paolini has captured the inhumanity of dragons, their indifference, their power and also in the case of Glaedr (couple of  small scenes) their terrible ferocity.     Critics have said that they didn't want to read the novel to hear about political and moral issues. But don't we experience these in the real world? All that makes Paolini's world seem more genuine.    His characters aren't too bad. In previous books they were much worse. Some seemed like blank-faced puppets dancing to the author's tune, but this time they were much more realistic.     Regarding the plot, it's influenced by other novels, and thus a bit predictable. I thought it was very obvious that the particular character who died in the end was going to die. But still, I am still eager to know how Eragon will triumph against the Dark King, because as far as I'm concerned, anything can happen in Book 4.
0375826726|5.0|I have anxiously awaited Brisingr for over 2 years, and it does not disappoint. The two previous installments of the Inheritance Series, Eragon and Eldest, were the best books I had ever read, but Brisingr is even better. Christopher Paolini's writing has greatly improved since Eragon, and though the book may slow down at times (what 700 page book doesn't have slow parts?), it always picks back up a few pages later.  Character development was great, and some may not like the moral issues Eragon goes through, but if he didn't have any moral issues, there would more than likely still be complaints that he was too heartless etc.  Saphira's personality improves greatly, she converses a lot more, and I think the parts with Saphira are very well written.  Some think the names that Saphira and Glaedr use (for example Saphira calls humans round-ear-two-legs) are monotonous and unimaginative,but it shows how dragons are so different than humans, elves, and dwarves.      Yes, there are politics when Eragon goes to Tronjheim for the election of a new dwarven king, but they really aren't that long, and there is a nice battle in the middle. It only lasts for 4 or so chapters, but it takes about 180 pages because of switches to Saphira, Nasuada, and Roran quite a bit at that time.    Overall, Brisingr is definitely one of the best books I've ever read, and I hope that book 4 will be just as good as the first three.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|At the risk of sounding like a cliche, I adored this book. I was intrigued with the title and couldn't wait to find out what it meant. \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\"? I love the fact that this was written in letters. I can't emphasize enough the wit of the title character, Juliet. There is all of the criteria for a great story,love,joy,true friendship,humor,tragedy,food, and sarcasm. I wanted to know the rest of the story. I wanted to write to my friends on Guernsey. To me the sign of a great book is the bond that I form with the characters. This book is a fast read. Bring a smile to your face !
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Silly, stupid, not scary, if you watch the extra's (because I wanted to see what their motive was for making such a bad film was, Godzilla, since Japan has a monster the USA should have one, I ain't kidding!  Also the monster was suppose to be a Baby monster that was scared and that's why it was running around crazy.)  Do not waste your time or money, thank God I didn't as I rented this garbage from the Public Library for free.
068484267X|3.0|The basic problem with it is that while McCourt's life of poverty in Ireland is interesting and there are a couple of dozen well written passages and anecdotes, the work is atrociously edited. All the more galling for the lack of good editing is that this was McCourt's first book- he needed the help. The book is about 450 pages long and the 1st 300 pages deal with his first 6 or so years of growing up. We get the same images of infant death, Irish blarney, drunken dad, suffering mom, stalwart Frankie, and colorful Eriniana. The problem is that early childhood is necessarily the least interesting part of a life because a) the percentage of real memories per year is very low and b) the remembered is rarely cogitated upon enough to produce any coherent thesis of its import or meaning to a life.<br /><br />  At describing these things McCourt is excellent. The scene of him and his brother getting bananas from a vendor in Brooklyn and his mom thinking he stole them is excellent, BUT such only works its charms once. After about 50 pages we get the idea already: McCourt's early life was bleak- it's as if he wants us to really, really know he suffered. The opening page or so at first read seems to poke fun at the Irish habit of bemoaning their woes, but it quickly becomes apparent that McCourt intended no irony in its felicitous prose. He truly wants the reader to know the Irish suffering is on par with that of Jews, blacks, and American Indians. By going on for 300 pages with this the reader starts to turn off about a third of the way though, then skimming between the Godotvian feeling anecdotes of misery.<br /><br />  Things only pick up when Frank reaches his teens- he gets various employment, has a falling out with his mom and her lover, rues his dad's departure, loses his virginity to a consumptive girl who dies, then heads off for America. There are many moving images and wonderfully non-stereotyped characters. The scenes with his tubercular lover are priceless, yet their whole affair is accorded a mere couple of pages vis-&agrave;-vis the dozens allotted the repetitious sufferings. A good editor would have told McCourt he had an intriguing 1st draft, but told him to cut the early years down to 100 pages, and double the teen tales to 300 pages. That 400 page edition of AA would have deserved all the acclaim the canonical edition has, while also being over 10% leaner.<br /><br />  This is the main reason why the film version of the book is actually better than the written version. That said, it's far from a great film, but it more judiciously accords the interesting portions of McCourt's life, with about ½ the film on the early years, and the rest on the teen years. As a writer I've often said that the poor practices of editors, publishers, and critics have had a disproportionately deleterious effect on contemporary literature. A bad editor either does not realize a gem that falls in their lap, passes on it, or butchers it, or they get a diamond in the rough, like AA, but have not the sense nor insight to demand the necessary revisions. Toni Morrison has made a career out of having her ill-edited novels published. Yes, she's gotten acclaim, but once dead her trip to the canon will be fruitless because the poor editing of her work will become ok to speak of.

1400063515|5.0|... but Dr. Taleb goes too far by claiming that the quantitative analysts, including statisticians, are (or even were) mesmerized by the Gaussian curve or any other quantitative concept, for that matter. Even the undergrads here at Purdue are taught to understand that the mean and standard deviation are not always descriptive of the distribution and that a single outlier can have a great impact on the fit of simple linear regression.  As for PhD-level people, there are enough of us able to handle data with care and who are well aware that Pareto & Barabasi is not a cool label of Italian fashion. By the way, how come that Extreme Value Theory (at least 60 years old) is never mentioned in the book dedicated to the extreme?<br /><br />I don't believe that such people as Markowitz, Scholes, or Samuelson thought even for a second that their job was to create models that would alleviate the hardship of the long-suffering investment banking community. That was never a requirement for academic promotion or the Nobel Prize, which was their ultimate goal, whether they admit it or not. Therefore, any \\"quant\\" who took those models at face value deserved all he got.<br /><br />Most importantly, I believe such misguided model-worshippers have always been few in the industry, especially after 1998.  MBA graduates, too, have enough sense to know what is what even after being through a Modern Portfolio Theory course. Courses like that, according to Dr. Taleb, have to be wiped out along with the academic disciples of Markowitz and Samuelson. But will that \\"ethnical cleansing\\" do any good?<br /><br />Perhaps the sad truth is that in the industry both MBAs and PhDs quickly realized that claiming they can quantify any financial product generates a fat stream of immediate bonuses, although at the expense of possible (but surely very distant :) blowup. If that is the case, all those people consciously use bogus models as a front. Hence, contrary to what Dr. Taleb thinks, Nobel Prize winners and their followers in the academia are hardly to blame. So, why don't we leave the distinguished professors alone and turn to those who set the malign short-term incentives in financial institutions.<br /><br />P.S.

During one day in Afghanistan, he demonstrates for a group of U.S. soldiers a different kind of weapon that works successfully and gets kidnapped by terrorists as he's held captive and forced to make the weapons for them. Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour-suit that helps him escape from hell and is sent back to the U.S., of course his friend Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation for himself and makes a deadly conspiracy. Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into \\"Iron Man\\" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil.<br /><br />Intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci-fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to \\"Dark Knight\\".

B000002H97|4.0|First off, let me say that I am not a metalhead at all. I barely know anything about the genre. But I like Metallica. And I refuse to accept the claim that this album is a sellout just because it doesn't thrash like Master of Puppets (which is a masterpiece). Sure, it doesn't, but that's an unfair reason to insult an album. It isn't as fast or hard, and it isn't as good, but it's got some of the best songs Metallica ever made.<br />First and most obviously is \\"Enter Sandman.\\" Like many others, I was introduced to the band via that song. Granted, the year was 2006 rather than 1991 and it was off my friends' iTunes rather than the radio or MTV. But my first exposure to the band was through that song's ominous, crawling riff. It's a great song, too. That riff is classic stuff. It was one of the album's five major hits, and I'm unashamed to say I love all five of them. This means not only \\"Sandman,\\" \\"Sad But True\\" (which probably has the best riff on the whole record), and the Eastern-informed \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" but also both \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters.\\" There go all my credentials. \\"The Unforgiven\\" is a classic power ballad, maybe not as good as \\"Fade to Black\\" or \\"Sanitarium\\" but still a fine, deeply emotional piece of work. And \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is probably the most melodic track in the group's history.<br />Those are the big highlights, along with the groove-metal monsters \\"God That Failed\\" and \\"My Friend of Misery.\\" But I enjoy just about every song on this album, other than the rather lame closer \\"Struggle Within.\\" I guess the thrash songs are a bit generic compared to previous albums, other than \\"Holier Than Thou\\" (another good song), but I think \\"Through the Never\\" and the underrated \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" are worthy songs. Even the jingoistic, rather hypocritical \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" rewrite \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" (interesting how a band who took a decidedly anti-government stance is now firmly endorsing the gulf war) is solid enough. After all, it's got the same riff as \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" and THAT is a guitar riff. Even if it's recycled.<br />This album really doesn't deserve the bad rap it gets with some fans. I think it's an example of the group branching out, rather than selling out. And it's good!

031606792X|5.0|Ok, I just want to address the reviews that say \\"all Bella's prblems go away so girls are taught that whatever goes wrong will ultimately fix itself and they won't have problems.\\" This is a little ridiculous because it is a piece of fiction.  Girls don't read a book like this and say, \\"Well Bella's life turned out to be ok.  SO I can do whatever I want and it will be fine.\\"  It doesn;t work this way and girls know this.  We learn a lot from fairy tales, and at it's core, that is what the Twilight Saga is.  It gives us hope, but that doesn't mean we believe everything in it.    All in all this was an amzing book and I was surprised at many times, almost all through the book.  It is definitely a piece of wonderful art!  Keep writting Stephenie Meyer!
B001CLG6RC|3.0|Enigma is back with their seventh foray into the pop ambient movement that began with their pioneering 1990 debut album aptly titled [[ASIN:B000002URV MCMXC A.D.]] which artistically infused Gregorian chant into neo-classical dance electronica with the hit singles [[ASIN:B000005JWS Sadeness, Pt. 1]] and [[ASIN:B000005RTC Mea Culpa, Pt. 2]] and instantly became internationally recognized trademarks spawning an entire Chant subculture movement whose motifs were further explored with ethnic cultural chant mixing on their brilliant follow-up album, 1993's [[ASIN:B000002U6E The Cross of Changes]] and by 1996's [[ASIN:B000000WC1 Enigma 3: Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!]], it seemed Enigma could do no wrong having dominated the 90's with their trendsetting ambient style continuing into the turn of the millennium with [[ASIN:B00003XB8K The Screen Behind the Mirror]] whose thematic operatic sampling of [[ASIN:B000003CSM Carl Orff: Carmina Burana]] seemed destined to be integrated with Enigma's signature breakbeats which were already beginning to diminish. By 2003's [[ASIN:B0000C7PQK Voyageur]], all of the familiar choral motifs that had given an identity to such an Enigmatic visage were all but jettisoned in favor of Michael Cretu's heavy reliance on synergistic pop vocals. In 2006 Enigma made something of a return to innocence to their New Age electronica style with [[ASIN:B000GRUS22 A Posteriori]] which abandoned the dominating Cretu vocals by embracing the spacey ambiance of trance. In 2008 Enigma releases the 2-disc Seven Lives Many Faces which is an extrapolation of many previous styles in their repertoire but again more of the same-old, same-old. You'll recognize many familiar trademarks beginning with the \\"Voice of Enigma\\" and ethnic vocals on tracks like \\"La Puerta Del Cielo\\" and \\"Between Generations\\" and vocals peppered sporadically throughout on tracks like the hip-hop sounding \\"Seven Lives\\" to \\"Distorted Love\\" and \\"J'Taime Till My Dying Day.\\" Seven Lives, Many Faces sounds quite subdued compared to the evolutionary pioneering mixes that brought Enigma to the forefront in the 90's and it's certainly not as edgy as their earlier works.

B001CLG6RC|3.0|I am a longtime Enigma fan and a composer by training. While the production values and many signature Enigma sound artifacts are very present, I simply did not enjoy this offering as much as previous efforts.    The compositions seemed, to me, to be overly repetitive. Two words kept coming into my mind: \\"House Trance\\". I found myself clicking through the songs before they finished. I didn't find enough melodic or harmonic development to keep me interested. It's unfortunate for me, but I am sure this offering will please many others, regardless.

This  small book is a great coffee table book, great for a small group show n tell and great just to  relax with from time to time. What I enjoyed about the book is that seeing the transformation of the letters in various formats makes one think about life's options. When you look at something, letters or anything else , how many different ways can it be reinvented- repurposed, effectively and creatively.  I enjoyed how the letters are morphed so that they have a fluidity and a beauty to them. I think this book is great for the elementary teacher who is teaching penmanship to add a little whimsy to learning. Great for the art teacher or fashion instructor whose trying to get the students to look at other creative options. If your are creative I think it could even be used as the back drop for a good bed time story  for parents to use with kids to show them creativity as well. If your not into being creative visually, the book definitely will show you that if you put your mind to it, you've got so many more options than the old standards. Look around in your world and see it differently.
0756404746|3.0|About the biggest flaw in Patrick Rothfuss' debut novel The Name of the Wind just so happens to occupy the inside cover and those pages before the story itself even begins to unfold.  Indeed, it may sound rather counterintuitive to fault the work for the vast praise heaped upon it but as a fantasy aficionado, truly many gratuitous comments from some of the industry's biggest names are either misaligned, contrived, or in some cases downright inaccurate.  But more on that later, let's take a look at the work itself in attempt to judge it on its own merit.<br /><br />To begin, the novel sets itself up fairly well with typical fantasy properties:  An innkeeper and some small town locals, the arrival of a mysterious eyeless, mouthless spider, third person narrative, and enough intrigue to keep the pages turning.  Only very shortly after does the reader come to realize that this structure serves only as a setup for the core of the tale which is told entirely in first-person perspective and backtracks nearly a lifetime in the process.  Don't get me wrong, first person fantasy can be done correctly on occasion (Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy is a prime example of it done successfully) but I felt like the biggest flaw in this instance was the continual swing from a dry crisp third person interlude (ala Robert Jordan) into an upbeat first-person recollection that has more in common with Dave Berry's weekly humor column in the Miami Herald than it does a grand fantastical adventure.<br /><br />Which leads me directly to my next complaint:  The book is clearly mismarketed both in terms of direct comparisons right on down to the dreary, almost horror-like look of the cover art.  Make no mistake that this work could very easily have been passed off a young adult fantasy/ juvenile fiction entry as the author goes out of his way to keep sexual content and violence to a minimum while simultaneously going into great detail of the mind set of a fifteen year old boy at the start of his collegiate life.<br /><br />In fact I was a bit perplexed by the fact that 85% of this book is a day-to-day chronological recap of the trials and tribulations of a boy in school.  In my opinion epic fantasy should deal with the struggles of ancient races on a grand scale of good versus evil.  Unfortunately a vast majority of the struggles presented here involve teen angst and the difficulties of being a broke student; if Lord of the Rings is epic fantasy, then what we have here is petty fantasy in the strictest sense of the word.  Throughout the text our hero happens upon money only to lose it time and time again then struggles with having to take out loans to pay for his tuition.  We spend many pages at taverns in the college town with drinking buddies and skipping classes (not to mention endless mischief and shenanigans that land the main character in the principal's office, er I mean chancellor's office over and over).  At times I found myself wondering if in fact somebody hadn't swapped my copy of The Name of the Wind and replaced it with Animal House The Dark Ages Edition or Harry Potter: The College Years.<br /><br />Additionally, some of the sociological references are downright blasphemous when used in the fantasy genre:  Concepts such as a professor stopping by his house to check the mail or fellow students flashing the thumbs-up to express approval of the actions of our main character.  Granted, there is no official rule stating that all fantasy must be set in medieval Europe, many of the references here do little more than pull the reader right out of the fantasy setting (which isn't all that strong to begin with).<br /><br />I suppose there are a few redeeming factors to mention.  The first of which involves a pretty ingenious (and consistent) magic system that just may be the most heavily scientific rooted of any and all fantasy works.  The second is Rothfuss' use of short chapters.  While some may view this as a negative, most readers I've discussed thebook with were glad for the frequent breaks to chop up the monotony of endless recapping.  Finally, this is one of few works that can't be criticized for ripping off the classics (as is so often the case in the fantasy genre).<br /><br />I began this review by expressing disappointment in the rave reviews that have been heaped upon this work and feel the need to justify such an odd complaint.  Read the back jacket or the first few pages of the book and you'll find yourself looking at a literal who's who of the fantasy industry with nothing but boisterous praise for the book.  Terry Brooks, Ursula K. Le Guin, Tad Williams, Anne McCaffrey, Robin Hobb, etc. are only a handful of the dozens of insiders blowing sunshine up the proverbial backside of this work.  So what, right?  Well, I suspect that the book would probably have faired better in my opinion had I gone into it without such high expectations.  As it stands, the reader is simply set up to be let down as I'm not quite sure any fantasy novel ever crafted could live up to the hype that surrounds this one!  A bit of humility could have gone a long way in allowing the reader to come to his or her own conclusions.  Instead I continually found myself waiting for something to happen to justify the rave opinions (it didn't happen, at least not in this, the first of a prospective trilogy).  Then again, maybe DAW plasters the book with praise knowing that it will help sell copies and in that line of thinking I have to confess that it worked on me.<br /><br />In conclusion, in reading Pat Rothfuss' blog entries, I feel like becoming published couldn't have happened to a nicer, more down to earth guy and as much as I hate to put down his work, it simply didn't do much for me (even though it seems to be wowing the industry).breaks to chop up the monotony of endless recapping.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|Thirty years later and this horror classic is still as scary as ever.  In the Hollywood horror genre today over-run with blood and gore, it is refreshing to take a break and return to the old school when horror films where truly (and still can be) scary.  There are many devices that has made Halloween a success.  Number one is Michael Myers, perhaps one of the most memorable horror villains of all time.  There is no motive for his actions.  He seems to kill without cause - an emotion-less villain who has never spoken a word almost his entire life.  One moment he appears out of nowhere, glaring from a distance, and the next moment, he's gone.  No matter how fast his victims run, Michael is always right behind, ready to make the kill, stabbing his victims with his trademark kitchen knife.<br /><br />Audio is one of the most important elements that can determine the success of a horror film, and above all else, John Carpenter's Halloween theme sets the tone all too well.  Even at the opening credits the theme begins, instantly placing the viewer into a creepy horror state of mind.  Slight variations of this simple theme are constant throughout the film, adding tension and suspense, and progressing scenes along nicely that might have seemed longer otherwise.<br /><br />The usual weak dialouge and acting are certainly present here, as in most horror films, but I can't say it takes away from the fun, as it is to be expected (especially from a film made 30 years ago).  Jamie Lee Curis does a memorable enough performance as her charcater Laurie, the babysitter who Michael has targeted on Halloween.  Donal Pleasance does a decent job as Dr. Loomis, a man who basically becomes obsessed (and has every right to) on taking down Michael Myers.  The remainder of the cast is unimpressive, but serve up well as Michael's victims.<br /><br /> Halloween has spawned off 7 sequals and even a recent remake.  Though they don't match up to this original, it says enough that Halloween has become a popular sucess.  I wish I could say for a movie that is 30 years old, it might be difficult for first time viewers today to appreciate, but the fact remains that this is from a different era of horror, a time when good horror films presented us with \\"less is more\\"  Halloween is the perfect demonstration.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|I wasnt really expecting much from Triviums new cd since their last album, the Crusade, was a bit of a letdown.  It was good, but it lost its agressive sound.  That is back without fail in this CD, and its a wonderful thrashfest.  I think the change to 7 string guitars for most of the songs (if not all) is a nice change as well.  I think this CD combines all of Triviums great elements, and it definitely puts them back in my good graces.
B00005Y1UX|2.0|This movie came out 15 years ago, and I wasn't impressed back then, even less so now. So why did I watch it again? Because my sister and I had different memories about how it ended. My sister was right, but she's wrong about it being a good movie! But then, she pretty much likes anything with Demi Moore in it. Go figure! The movie is loosely based on the novel by Jack Engelhard.<br /><br />There are too many huge flaws in the story. Oddly, the word prostitution is never mentioned. The circumstances leading up to the \\"deal\\" are odd, too. We never actually find out just what it is about Demi Moore's character that the billionaire finds so appealing. He smiles whenever he watches the husband and wife together, as if he's getting some kind of kick out of it. But what is behind the smiling? Is he thinking that he'd enjoy being a wedge in the relationship, wondering if he has the power to break it up? I suppose we may assume he felt a purely physical attraction, but surely he has easy (and cheaper) access to women even more beautiful than Demi.<br /><br />We never learn why he offers a million dollars to sleep with Demi. Is it just because he is in a particularly mischievous mood that evening in Las Vegas, or is he really so hopelessly drawn to her? Even more mysterious is why this playboy bachelor in his fifties would fall in love with a happily married woman in a one night stand for which he paid a million dollars. We find out later that the playboy billionaire has a soft spot in his cold heart and for reasons we never discover he decides that Demi is the person who can bring love and happiness to his empty life and sprawling mansion.<br /><br />The billionaire frequently says how \\"amazing\\" Demi is, but he never says why she is amazing. We never see them have a real conversation, or even exchange tender words. As a person, Demi has no dreams of her own. She is a not-so-successful real estate agent, and she doesn't seem to have any ambitions other than to be the wife of a successful architect husband. The husband seems to feel the pressure from this and worries that his wife is feeling disappointed and frustrated. The billionaire criticizes the husband for allowing his wife to sleep with him, but he never criticizes the wife. I ask you, since it is HER body, who is the more responsible party? Not to mention the fact that it was the wife who really convinced the husband it would be okay.<br /><br />Yet another huge flaw is the unexplained and sudden jump from Demi hating the billionaire to loving him. Even after the deal was consummated, the billionaire continued to interfere with the couple's life in an obvious attempt to break up the marriage. The wife had good reason to hate him for this, because it demonstrated that he was willing to abuse power and hurt people in order to satisfy his selfish desires. But what does Demi do when her husband's anger and doubts get the better of him? She runs back to the billionaire and falls for his sweet talk, and before long they plan to get married.<br /><br />This movie only pretends to look at how gray-area moral decisions can affect our lives. One could just as well ask if it is moral to be a workaholic miser in order to make a million dollars, or the CEO of, say, a cigarette company. There are a million ways to sacrifice oneself on the altar of money and power. The moral component of this movie is watered down because the husband and wife are not \\"innocent\\" or sympathetic characters. They gamble all of their money in Las Vegas, in the idiotic pursuit of getting the money they want quickly, and even after winning a large amount, they gamble all of that on a single bet, which of course they lose. What do I care, and how surprising is it, if such a husband and wife then accept a million dollars for a one night stand?<br /><br />There are the old jokes about how the price of sex determines whether someone is a prostitute. This movie mixes up money with love. How might the story play out withoutthe billionaire falling in love? How might a good marriage be affected without all of the silly complications in this movie? If a happily married couple were to accept such an offer, is it by definition a bad marriage? If a happily married couple were to make the mistake of accepting such an offer, how might they recover from the mistake? Is accepting such an offer worse, or more damaging, than an affair? Alas, none of these more nuanced topics are covered in this movie. Instead we get a simplistic plot that merely teases. I suppose \\"Indecent Proposal\\" was a good prequel for Demi's next movie \\"Striptease.\\"might a good marriage be affected without all of the silly complications in this movie?

B000P0J074|4.0|It's a great movie which represent what is very typical of the eigthies both in clothing and style throughout all of the 'living world' scenes.  Beetejuice's character is wodnerfully played -- it's hard to watch him and imagine him as Batman as well because he really gets into this character.  It's kind of a dark, inside-kind-of-joke, movie where you really need to listen to the main character speak because he says so much under his breath, but in-hindsight the second time around, he's much more funny than I remember.
0307387178|3.0|This book was okay it wasn't all that great, but if you like an autobiography then this is the book for you.
B0013D8LCW|3.0|This is kind of one of those predictable, cornball romantic movies where, as soon as you get into the plot, you can predict each following step of certain characters...granted, there isn't anything wrong with that sometimes, even here, it was still a lovely film that served it's purpose and I would recommend at least getting a used copy of and sitting down with a new boyfriend and watching it.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This film is revolutionary in my opinion, because it broke the boundaries of the televised film at a time when tv storytelling technique was quickly evolving. The subject matter seems to have pushed the format forward and what results is a strange hybrid of tones. The performances are both smoothed for the medium and roughed up for the content. This was before editing for television so aggressively engaged the audience, but the subtlety of the acting choices seems to presage that. Characters are battling insanity, in a mainstream tv context, so the challenge is particularly high. It is almost theatrical in the use of stock footage. I'm especially impressed that they didn't sink into a morass of moralism with the script. The spare quality of the third act is almost like a classic foreign film, and the unfinished feeling in many of its plot elements is a relief rather than a disappointment.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly series was recommended by a friend. I came to Amazon again and was not disappointed. The seller communicated right away and was good for their word; the item arrived just fine, all as stated. Thanks again.
B000U9X1UM|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing Zoe Bell, the stuntwoman, in a dramatic role, especially with a great action filmmaker like Quentin Tarentino at the helm. But the first part of the move and the second part do not mesh together well. It's unfortunately like two separate stories with some parallel themes and one common denominator psycho killer character (Kurt Russell).     Give Zoe some acting lessons and she's gonna burn up the screen doing her own stunts and bringing her own special flair.     Well photographed! A little self indulgent. Still enjoyable.
B002O6FBW0|5.0|This is an eerie movie which tells the story of doctor and his charge...a somnambulist named Cesare who mostly sleeps but sometimes wakes up to tell scary fortunes (like you're going to die tomorrow) or kill people.  Cesare is of course played by the immortal Conrad Veidt (who not only basically was the star of silent Weimar cinema but also later went on to become Casablanca's Major Strasser) with Veidt's usual supreme skill.<br /><br />Though I think Cesare ranks much lower on the scare-o-meter than say his contemporary Nosferatu, he's nonetheless significant for having helped inaugurate an era when movies could be REALLY scary.  By that I reference that great golden era of frightening silent film classics of 1919 to 1931 which includes numerous classics...Nosferatu (which I already mentioned), Waxworks (which features Veidt in one of its three stories), The Hands of Orlac (which also stars Veidt), Student of Prague (again featuring Veidt), Der Mud Tod (the first BIG Fritz Lang movie, co written by his then wife Thea von Harbou), and of course any other Weimar movie you will no doubt accuse me of forgetting in the comments section.<br /><br />Though there are those who feel confident that the doctor and Cesare were reality (along with their bad deeds), part of the weirdness of this movie for me came from the idea that maybe the dividing line between reality and nightmare wasn't so strong. And maybe it doesn't have to be either because even though we know we've just woken up from a nightmare, it's still a scary experience...like this movie...because of the inherent terror that exists even in frightening possibilities.<br /><br />Maybe Weimar producers -- creating their horror right on the eve of Hitler's Nazi Germany -- were unique in the power of their horror because of their &#34;privileged&#34; position as all too soon to be witnesses of it.<br /><br />Just a thought.
B001CQONKY|5.0|Tied with season six as my favorite. Sara's always been my favorite character, and I loved seeing her character even more this season, although she left in \\"Goodbye and Good Luck\\". I thought that episode, along with the season six episode, \\"The Unusual Suspect\\" was extraordinary.
0802136834|3.0|If you are a fan of Philippa Gregory, like myself, and you relish in the scandals and dramatics of King Henry VIII's Court, this may not be the book for you.  This reads a lot more like a history textbook.  Not exactly salacious or trashy.  Just provides a lot of background and facts about this period of time.  I just couldn't stay engrossed.  I guess I need the fictionalized version, no matter how accurate it may be.  Not exactly a short casual read by any means.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|Film noir continues to be one of the most difficult genres to make well particularly today (I'd note for purists that film noirs are largely in black & white a fixture of the genre). Film directors can't hide the flaws of a noir behind big explosions, car chases or visual effects. \\"L.A. COnfidential\\" probably isn't for everyone because it combines the film noir genre with a solid mystery and strong dramatic performances.<br /><br />Set in Los Angeles during the early 1950's, \\"L.A. Confidential\\" opens with a bang quite literally--Three very different detectives the by-the-book golden boy Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), the hard nosed violent Bud White (Russell Crowe) and the celebrity obsessed Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)try and unravel the conspiracy behind a seemingly random shotgun slaying at a popular diner and how it is tied into the murders of organized crime kingpin Mickey Cohen's gang. The three detectives make a reluctant team hoping to solve the crime and achieve their own personal agendas in the process. They also must find out how Lynn Bracken (Kim Bassinger) a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake and a cavalcade of other hookers made up to look like Hollywood stars figure into all of this.<br /><br />Well directed by Curtis Hansen from a terrific script by Brian Helgeland and Hansen that manages to adapt James Ellroy's novel without betraying its story or atmosphere, \\"L.A. Confidental\\" was nominated for a bucket load of Oscars winning two for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Bassinger). The entire cast is terrific from Crowe to Danny DeVito who plays Sid Huggins the editor of the scandal rag L.A. Confidential. Spacey plays oily Vincennes with confidence and style while Crowe embodies the brutal force of Bud White. Pearce who plays Exley the son of a highly regarded murdered police officer gives depth to a character that could easily have been cookie cutter.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning particularly. How does this look in comparison to the 1998 original DVD release? There's greater detail and sharpnes. The original DVD was one of the best transfers of its era (and still holds up remarkably well). The new DVD also looks sharper but the Blu-ray manages to capture the golden cinematography Oscar nominated Dante Spinotti perfectly.<br /><br />We get a great mix of previously released extras ported over from the first \\"Special Edition\\" when DVDs were still being released in snapcases to some stunning brand new ones as well. The best here is the audio compilation of comments by the director, cast and crew. Although it isn't as fascinating as a scene specific commentary track, it allows each important member of the creative team to give their thoughts on shooting the film, the characters and the story.<br /><br />\\"Whatever You Desire\\" is a brand new 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. \\"Sunlight to Shadows\\" another new extra focuses on the cinematography. \\"The Cast\\" is pretty self explanatory focuses on the seven main characters and two relative \\"unknowns\\"-Pearce and Crowe. \\"From Book to Screen\\" gives us Hansen and Helgland discussing the difficulty of translating Ellroy's terrific novel to the screen without sacrificing too much of the story or characters. We also get two very neat extras--\\"L.A.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|Jennifer Hudson showed her behind on the album. I saw other reviews on how bad and how this and that the album so I had to put in my two cents! This album was outstanding. It showcased her voice perfectly. EVERY song was on point with working around her huge voice.    My Heart- IS WHAT WE NEEDED! Crazy Beat and HEAVENLY smooth vocals.    Pocketbook- HA HA HA...Will make you wanna wreck your car wile driving its so infectious....the hook \\"I got my hair in a ponytail, and they on me\\" will be the first line u learn lol.    FANTASIA Duet: Jennifer really showcases her \\"acting\\" at the beginning of the song. And thed uet is priceless. Fantasia is awesome.    Giving myself- Should come with napkins inside the album lol.    OVERALL AN EXCELLENT DEBUT!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This was good season on Supernatural. Brothers bravely met and fought obstacles on their life journey, did not forgetting to care of each other. Wide screen DVDs wrapped in good, easy to get, spread. Overall design of the box is beautiful due in main part to catchy cover photo. One thing is not thought through. Your have a chance to download all season free from Internet, but you can do it only one time and all episodes at once. With slow Internet connection like 768kbs it is mostly impossible. They have to allow download each episode separately.
B000I2J2XQ|5.0|If you're not a kid and/or didn't read the book.....run as far away from this drivel as you can. It is so contrived and boring and long and sad........I know it is hugely popular...but I fell asleep several times as the dialog went on and on in the most ridiculous directions! Just pure nothing this film.  Boring, Boring, Boring............although my kids loved it...they really do love the book and this film - so I have to add that to this review. It just was definitely not my kind of film.......The Lord of the Rings, though........that's another story! That's what you should go see if you like fantasy films and are older than 9!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki, obviously, is an amazing director.  Joe Hisaishi's music just makes this movie jump to an astronomical level.  I usually get sick of movies very quickly, but no matter how many times I watch this movie..it just takes my breath away.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
055358894X|5.0|What I love about \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" by Scott Lynch is that it isn't your typical fantasy. The setting isn't reminiscent of Medieval England or ancient Scandinavia or the like, but rather it looks and feels like the Renaissance era of Italy. Also, the characters are much more anti-heroic than the protagonists found in other fantasy novels. And plus, the dialogue is sharp and witty (I hope you don't mind heavy profanity). The plot twists are hard-hitting, and the ending of \\"Lamora\\" leaves you wanting more. Well, luckily \\"Red Seas Under Red Skies,\\" the sequel, has come out before I bought and read this one. I'll be reading that soon.<br /><br />Grade: A
0979660742|2.0|The book is great, I mean it's a classic but this version looks like it came right off the photo copier of the original print from 100 years ago. It's horribly fussy and the copy spacing is poor. I suggest finding a version by a different publisher.
B00009V7OR|5.0|You don't need the philosophies of Plato or Schopenhauer or Descartes to watch this film. Watch it for what it is: an suspenseful action-packed sci-fi film. Although it does seem a bit long (just over 140 minutes), the film doesn't seem to drag at all. The subplots are interesting, and the special effects won't really disappoint. The actors and their characters are memorable (the chemstry between Goldblum and Hirsch is a plus for the father-and-son genre). David Arnold's music is spectacular, and it's one of my favorite scores. And finally, I don't really mind the overpatriotism found in this film, just as long as I can focus on the action and the aliens.<br /><br />A-
B0018AK9RA|4.0|JP goes in a different direction on Nostradamus...and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Gone are the shredding guitar solos that have been their hallmark for decades. I've listened to this 5 times through now and I can honestly say it gets better with each listen. Fans looking for Painkiller II will be sorely disappointed. This is not a CD you'll want to crank up as you're pulling up to a stoplight to try to impress the hot chick (or elderly couple) next to you with your ability to listen to loud music (btw, no one over the age of 18 is ever impressed with this skill in case you're wondering). However, if you can come in without any preconcieved notions of what Judas Priest should sound like, Nostradamus can provide an entertaining journey, albeit a different one than Priest fans might be used to. It would be hard to deny that JP has earned the right to do what they want with their music after three-and-a-half decades. As far as I'm concerned, if they choose to make a Christmas Album with the Wiggles next, so be it. I certainly don't feel they owe me anything at this point.    For some reason I was never consulted during the creation of this CD. However, had my opinion been requested I would have had a few suggestions. For instance, since they were going in this symphonic direction anyway, I wish they would have taken it a bit further and added more orchestra and choir elements. Especially given the topic, I thought they could have mixed in some more classical material to help bring the listener into a journey through the French Renaissance. I also would have added some haunting choir pieces that would have helped conjure images of the church that was both friend and foe to Nosty at various times. Rob certainly has the voice to pull off the theatrical sound.
B0015FML06|5.0|This 5 star is essentially combining the live mini CD with the Live at Red Rocks DVD. In my mind the DVD is the headliner because it so great seeing the band in their formative years with 17 tracks, it is a set befitting the bitterness of their epic songs. Packaged alone the live CD is way too short; so, bravo to the overall packaging. On that note the design & package is a booklet inside a sturdy outside sleeve, beautifully packaged.<br /><br />The music is electric, the content and execution on both CD & DVD are great and need no further accolades from me. On both, Adam Clayton's outstanding bass playing shines through quite brilliantly. *The quality of the DVD has been questioned by the reviewers on the \\"Live at Red Rocks\\" DVD, at that I say take it for what it is because it does not take away from the fantastic performance and the Sound Quality is Great!<br /><br />I highly recommend U2 Live: Under a Blood Red Sky - Deluxe Edition, whether you are a casual or die-hard fan.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|I have bought mine and it does not play.  Apparently there is a problem with the Blu-ray code.

1400032717|5.0|What an awesome idea. This book is unlike any other I have read. Telling a story from the persepctive of an autistic boy's point of view is brilliant. You will follow this boy's plight step by step as he struggles to come to terms with an \\"event\\" about which he knows very little. Great book.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|All I gotta say is wow. I'm a big fan of TV on DVD and have been searching for my next show to get into. I have all the 24 seasons, all the Lost seasons (my two favorites...until now), and was looking for something to watch since I'm all caught up on those two shows and prefer serial type shows.<br /><br />I decided to give Shield a shot remembering the glowing reviews (and controversy) it had when it first came out back in...well, whenever it came out (sorry, currently too lazy to dig for that particular fact).<br /><br />I can say that the first season of The Shield was probably some of the best stuff I have ever seen in a TV  show. It is on par with some of the best movie dramas ever made. I highly recommend this show to anyone who has not seen it before (those folks like me looking for TV on DVD they haven't seen before). I can only hope that further seasons live up to this first one.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|It's not a bad movie. There are some funny parts, but fart jokes just don't do it for me. What in the world is so hilarious about passing gas, for crying out loud, besides it being utterly embarrassing?  The animation by Pacific Data Images is first rate, although does not hold a candle in comparison to the scope, effort, and complexity that was placed in Square's \\"Final Fantasy\\". As for story, I've actually found the story in \\"Final Fantasy\\" to be more touching and more involving than the story of \\"Shrek\\". Don't get me wrong, \\"Shrek\\" has a decent story, but it's not quite as elaborate as \\"Final Fantasy\\".  (In \\"Final Fantasy\\", you may have to watch the movie a second time to get it. It is hard to follow, but it introduces a level of intrigue that makes it more interesting. If you can actually understand the story clearly, then it actually feels far more powerful than what you would originally think.)
B001GAPC1K|4.0|I just want to make it clear that I love the movie.  I have a few quibbles with the script, but nothing that serious. {Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung-Fu?}    My real quibble is with the Blu-ray transfer team.  They did not implement DTS-HD Master Audio, which is the top-flight audio standard Blu-Ray offers.  They should have used DTS-HD MA.  Also, there is some softness and grainy noise in the picture occasionally.  I found this very surprising.  Certainly, a movie just released this summer cannot have had time to degrade on a media shelf somewhere in North Hollywood.  Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements.  Certainly, they should have been able to avoid some of the problems associated with film transfer?    I am afraid Paramount is still figuring out Blu-Ray after having been entrenched in the HD-DVD camp.
B000EQ5TSI|4.0|Let me say, the trailer was good. Wetted my appetite for the real deal...  Sorry to say that the film was cliche, the fight scenes could have been improved (should have hired Woo Ping Yuen as the martial arts director), the editing was not sharp enough to backup the action. Some of the scenes like on the bike was so unrealistic that the Hong Kong audience found it unrealistic (after being brought up on unrealistic martial arts film in HK, I would have thought we could have accepted this)...  The MI team is supposed to be a hi-tech team with lots of gadgetry like in MI part 1, but in MI2, we don't see much of this.  This is another run of the mill action film. John Woo's direction was disappointing, laboured over some of his trademarks such as the slow motion cam, plus the doves. The damn dove and the damn pigeons!  There are some good new tricks (like shooting backwards on the bike by looking at the rear view mirror), but the emphasis was not there. It didn't look as cool as it should have. I can't put my finger on the thing that ruined the film... but it definitely could have been much much better.  Gladiator is a better bet for the summer's action...

B000005JH9|5.0|Man Machine being Kraftwerk's 1978 release is such a good recording. Starting of with the classic track The Robots. Later showcasing more amazing tracks like the social satire The Model. The cover is classic Kraftwerk. The four members dressed in red shirts, with stern faces and red lipstick. The sound of these homemade keyboards is quite remarkable. They managed by themselves to create sounds that have not been equalled even today. EMI United Kingdom certainly were a bit niggardly when it comes to the book-let. There are no lyrics and it contains of just 4 pages. No pictures of the robots inside? Even so this is a quintessential recording for fans of Kraftwerk and early electronic music!
B0013LKZWS|5.0|I had already decided to adopt Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida\\" as the best album for the year of 2008, but then I got introduced to a song called \\"Gravity.\\"    I couldn't rest until I got my hands on this album, and from start to finish Bareilles is simply superb. Every arrangement is touching, and her soulful, melodic voice gives me chills. I've been carrying it around in my mp3 player, and for the exception of one song, I've rated the entire album with four, five stars all throughout.    Sara's writing skills are simply one of the best out there. She infuses her melodies with heart. This is not music just for the sake of success. It is true art, and I am now a huge fan.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|During the 70's Kraftwerk released records at a much quicker pace then they have been doing the last 20 years. Trans-Europe Express was their 1977 release and their 6 th release that decade alone. The sound is truly timeless and to listen to synth sounds that have not been surpassed even today is quite remarkable. This record starts out with several hidden gems. Europe Endless and The Hall of Mirrors. The track Trans-Europe express is such an amazing track and verily one of Kraftwerk's magnu opus. The lyrics are quite good, and much of the singing is done without the vocoder which shows that they are much better vocalists then many give them credit.
031606792X|5.0|I know that the vast majority of people were irritated that little Ms. or should I say Mrs. Bella got all that she wanted. Personally I thought that this was perfectly fine seeing as how this book was a fanasy and in all respects it was the author's choice to end things on a good note. I am a sucker for happy endings and like a lot of girls out there I was on team Edward, so therefore I was quite pleased at the two being able to enjoy forever together. I much like Bella in book three am not that thrilled with the consept of children, however I realize that those maternal desires can be changed...especially when you are in love. I have been recommending Stephenie Meyer's books to any unsuspeting person that I can come across. I liked that everyone was happy at the end of the book, even thought I think that the Volturi will not leave the Cullens alone. I can't wait and hope that Stephenie choses to continue the series.
B000026GAG|5.0|Computer World being Kraftwerk's 1981 release was quite avantgarde for its time. At the time not many people used or owned computers so to sing about owning a computer such is in the track Home Computer was quite ahead of its time. Other classic tracks is the track Pocket Calculator. Compared to the release Trans-Europe Express here they have used the vocoder a whole lot more with a very successfull result. One funny side-not was that Kraftwerk used a speak and spell toy which was made by Texas Instruments during the recording of several of the tracks on this record. The book-let is quite minimal (almost to a fault?!) with no lyrics and very little information inside. The cover is a reminder of how early computers looked like and many kids today will be suprised if they see the cover today.
B001CT877Q|4.0|Eraser is a good action flick but, is this edition good enough to satisfy the fans?    Well, technically this BD is quite strong. The master used is in very good shape and there's nothing important that can distract us. The video quality is satisfactory with an average detail level and a little softer picture.  Audio track isn't as agressive as we can hear in newer productions but the action sounds vibrant enough to feel the movie.    The low point is obvious: there's no extra content. Well, most of us like to dig a little inside the production, so this issue it's disappointing but, overall, the more important thing is the movie and Warner did their homework right with that.    For a catalog title Eraser is a thumb up.
B0015FML06|4.0|I just got my copy of the dvd/cd last night and loved it....except what is the red wiggly line through 75% of the DVD? The 5.1 sound was awesome and yes it's too bad a couple songs were edited (royalties?)    But all in all it was great....I'll have to read the book and see if they mention the red lines in the dvd.

B0017I1FP8|5.0|I believe it has already been summed up well by other positive reviews from others much more knowledgeable about music than myself. It is an amazing album and amplifies Dark Knight's greatness. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have complemented the movie masterpiece with a musical masterpiece.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Filmed for about two years during the making of the poorly received album \\"St. Anger\\", \\"some Kind of Monster is a healing journey into the hard-beating heart of rock & roll\\" (-Jeff Shannon). Lol. Right. This is where they got a lot of material for the cartoon comedy series on Adult Swim, METALOCALYPSE. Seriously, it is. Check out the first season. And it's impossible to not think of the classic mockumentary THIS IS SPINAL TAP, the parallels with it getting a little odd.<br /><br />This up-close, intimate journey of self discovery and blah, blah, blah makes you wonder if having kids and sobering up is a good idea. I tempted to say, NO, stay drunk and unmarried. Above all, stay hungry and motivated or take a break. But what we see here is natural and to a large extent inevitable. It's just the way it goes. SOME KIND OF MONSTER is a great portrait of over the hill men that happen to be in the most successful metal band of all time, going through what appears to be a midlife crisis. Some say it took guts for them to allow themselves to be filmed like this, in all these personal, awkward situations over a period of years. I'm not so sure THAT much courage is what it required with egos of this size. In this age of reality TV and everyone exposing themselves on the internet, is it that big a deal? Besides, it could be good for your career right? But they do expose themselves, warts and all.<br /><br />One of the weirdest characters is the $40,000-per-month \\"performance enhancement coach\\" Phil Towle. He's in much of the film wearing these sweaters and he's actually named Phil. Phil seems to think he's in the band after awhile, at one point submiting lyrics. METALLICA in group therapy is the main focal point.<br /><br />You are witness to some entertaining scenes 'like a fly on on a wall' as they say. Former band member from back in the day Dave Mustaine's misty eyed apperance... I'd argue that courage on his part. That moment was a long, long time coming. BUT this scene brings up the issue of editing. Mustaine now considers this the \\"final betrayal\\" claiming that parts of the conversation with Lars were not shown. We meet the band's families and see them as sons and daddies, see them struggle in the studio, deal with long time bassist Jason Newsted's departure, get a new bassist, deal with various situations, hang out with their stuff, sell a Basquiat painting...<br /><br />Overall, an entertaining portrait of a famous rock band worth checking out even if your not a huge Metallica fan. (Or haven't been for years.) Definitely in the top several best rock n roll documentaries.iting.

0307388921|4.0|Like Fight Club, Choke is kind of a short, biographical (and in parts sad, very sad) micro-history of the weird, their weirdnesses, and the world outside of our peripheral vision.  Palahniuk turns up things that make me both jealous and glad that I'm not the subject of his work.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|HBO Series True Blood is perfect to me! This is the only show that has kept me anticipating every new episode. Now I had not read the books prior to watch the show, so seeing comments from all of Charlaine's of all the differences between the show and books prompted me to go ahead and purchase at least books 1-4 today.<br /><br />However I doubt even after reading the books that my perception will change. I love the show and the Bill Compton and Sookie Stackhouse characters are wonderful. I think the casting of Anna Paquin as Sookie and Stephen Moyer as Bill was brilliant!<br /><br />I'm glad to hear that HBO has renewed the show for a 2nd season and I cannot wait until the entire season one is available on DVD. I have all 1-4 episodes aired so far on DVR so that's my Bill and Sookie fix until every Sunday at 9 pm.<br /><br />[...]
0345495004|4.0|Having grown up knowing who Frank Lloyd Wright was (a famous architect), but knowing little about him personally, I was unprepared for the eagerness and antipation with which I devoured this novel once I began.  I was intrigued by the great intellects Frank and Mamah are portrayed as having. Their fictionalized conversations are fascinating! All the while I was appalled by their affair and decision to leave their families--notably their children.  This is a wholly engaging read with an ending that, if you are not already aware of the historical facts, will give you a shocking surprise.
0312427999|5.0|America's financial crisis will be remembered by all the countries that we screwed with the nefarious Friedman laissez-faire neo-con shock policies.  I don't see them (eg South Korea) coming to the rescue by providing new funds to shore up our ailing financial institutions; instead, they will pull the plug on the grounds that their sovereign funds and T-bills went south and this action will only add to the predicament as they retreat with their sour investments.  After ruining their economies with our demands for reforms (cut government spending, curb trade unions, privatize industries, remove trade barriers and reduce regulation), why should we think differently?      They may come back only to buy America at distressed prices!    Klein's book is excellent and I know that the Chilean and Russian descriptions are very accurate.  I would add that she should have mentioned more in chapter 11 that the intent of the West was to destroy the Russian military-industrial complex (to slow up arms exports and further deny Russia trade receipts). The Russians should have suspected that they were not going to get favorable treatment or aid.  Gorbachev knew and paid the price, but Yeltsin played into the great conspiracy trap.
0307269752|5.0|I finished 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' in a blaze of glory-- it was one of those things where you look at how much you have left to read and then you look at the clock and say \\"One more chapter\\"... The chapter is finished-- you again look at the clock and what now remains to be read and say \\"One more hour\\"...  The cycle continues unabated until 4am when you finish the book and are a mixture of sleepy (it's 4am), excited (it was a really good book), sad (the really good book is now over and you're back where you started), and anticipatory (there are *sequels* to the really good book-- however, they haven't been translated to English yet and are not available-- le sigh).<br /><br />Larsson has done a fantastic job of creating memorable, well fleshed-out characters and combining them with a new and intriuging plot...  Some of the material is not for the faint of heart, but it gives the story a depth and breadth that is lacking in works by more timid authors.  My only complaint is that his other books in this Millenim series aren't available in English for immediate purchase-- the last time I felt this way about characters (especially Lisbeth Salander) was when I read Harry Potter.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I am not going to rehash the plot of the movie the way WAY TOO MANY reviewers do these days.  Instead I am going to give you all you need to know.  Go watch this film!  It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date.  Granted, the original story was \\"updated\\" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days.  That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming).  However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST.  WHY?  Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero.  What  novel concept!  Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved.  You got this one right!  This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B001AGNMIU|5.0|I always liked the story of \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" but I felt it was overrated. This movie is a MAJOR improvement. The original story is basically this; Ichabod (an eccentric school teacher) comes to town; he falls in love with Katrina Van Tassel; Bram Bones gets jealous; Bram Bones gets jealous; Bram Bones dresses up like the Headless Horseman and chases Ichabod out of town.<br /><br />This movie changes the story (in my opinion) for the better. Ichabod is a constable who is having trouble with his superiors. (Notably Christopher Lee.) They send him to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow so he can prove his scientific methods for solving crime. (One is at least entitled to wonder if they are hoping he will get killed.) The first thing you will notice about Ichabod Crane (now a constable) is that he is A LOT MORE INTELLIGENT than in the book. He arrives at Sleepy Hollow and finds the people to be clannish. But he does make some friends who are willing to help him. While he is eccentric, we can see that his methods for solving crime have their logic.<br /><br />Bram is of course jealous when Ichabod has his eyes on Katrina. The events of the original story are quickly gone through. But this time, Bram succeeds in scaring Ichabod only for a moment, rather than away.<br />Ichabod then encounters the real Headless Horseman. While Ichabod is obviously terrified, he pulls himself together to find out what he can. (Even someone who comes back from the dead to kill could be following a pattern and have some motive.) One especially artful moment is when Ichabod is cutting at the tree of the dead. He gets splattered with blood, and we are not quite sure whether we should laugh or be scared.<br /><br />Without giving the story away, the more Constable Crane finds out, the more scared we can get. (Especially when Depp learns that the Horseman is not killing at random, and some live person may be controlling him.) Recognition can be VERY SCARY if well done. Poor Depp is also fighting his nightmares from his past. He has nightmares about his the murder of his mother and why he prefers logic and reason over religion.) The climax defines horror, and there is an especially interesting twist. (We are allowed at least a moment of sympathy for the Headless Horseman, who was so well played by Christopher Walken I may add.)<br /><br />Between the phenomenal scenery, the great music, the interesting deviations from the book, the interesting connections between Crane's past and present, the great acting by Depp, Gambon, Ricci, Lee, Walken, and others, the gradual unfolding, and the surprise twists, this movie is a masterpiece of horror. Johnny Depp will probably always be best known as Edward Scissorhands and Captain Jack Sparrow. But personally, I think this is his best movie.past.

031606792X|1.0|I started reading this series because I wanted to see what it was like before the movie came out. I loved the first three books and read them in two days but the fourth one was AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am not going to rehash what made it horrible because it has all been said (and very well) in other reviews but I wanted to add my opinion to hopefully let the author know just how horrified some of her fans are. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?????????!!!!!!!!! She said that the first book came out of a dream, well I think this one must have come from a drug-induced nightmare. I am going to go back and reread the first three before I see the movie to wash the terrible taste that was Breaking Dawn out of my mouth and hopefully to wipe the boring, pointless, characterless images out of my brain. DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY! STOP AFTER ECLIPSE!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I love Firefly to death and Serenity collector's edition is just a beautiful edition to my dvd collection.

B001AKTZPA|5.0|\\"Green River\\" is one of Creedence Clearwater Revival's best albums. Of course, all 6 albums released by CCR in 1968-1970 are essential, but \\"Green River,\\" an album that yielded 4 hit singles and went to #1, was the album that really established CCR's fame. Before this album, they only had one true hit, \\"Proud Mary.\\" Personally, I probably prefer \\"Willy and the Poorboys,\\" but since all 6 true CCR albums are so solid, it is hard to choose a favorite.<br /><br />\\"Green River\\" features the best non-hit CCR song, \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone.\\" All of the songs are great, with a dark undertone to all of them, except the cover \\"Night Time Is the Right Time,\\" the weakest track here. It is easy to see why this album was so popular in the summer of 1969, a time of intense turmoil for the country. This album perfectly reflected a time when the country might be seen as teetering on the brink of implosion.<br /><br />The album sounds great on this reissue, but the original album sounded great too. I wouldn't expect the bonus tracks to be revelatory, since a band that released 6 albums in little more than 2 years would hardly have left much on the cutting room floor. There are 5 bonus tracks on \\"Green River,\\" 2 unfinished studio cuts (no vocals) and 3 live tracks from the 1971 European tour. \\"Glory Be\\" actually sounds like it could be a great song, a real fast rocker a la \\"Commotion.\\" \\"Broken Spoke Shuffle\\" is a generic instrumental workout. The 3 live tracks show that CCR merely duplicated their songs in live performance, without straying very far, only offering an extended solo on \\"Green River\\" that segues into \\"Susie Q.\\"<br /><br />This is a great album, but if you already own it on CD, you're not getting much from this reissue but some non-essential bonus tracks and a slightly improved sound.

B000QUCNP4|3.0|It seems like a lot of serial killers sprang up in the 1960s/70s. The Boston Strangler, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and The Hillside Stranglers all brought fright and terror to their cities. One of the more bizarre serial killers was The Zodiac, who operated in the San Francisco area beginning in 1968. The film ''Zodiac'' focuses on the events surrounding his killings and how the case drove one man following the case nearly out of his mind.<br /><br />In the movie the Zodiac killer begins his murder spree by shooting some young couples then eventually striking right in the heart of San Francisco. He then taunts the San Francisco Chronicle's staff with cryptic letters and proof that he knew secret details about the gruesome murders. The paper's cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes obsessed with the case, along with the lead journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.)<br /><br />As the case progresses Downey's character becomes overwhelmed by personal demons and police make little progress in finding the killer. But Graysmith continues to hunt for clues, even as the killings stop and life moves on. Eventually Graysmith alienates everyone around him, annoys the police, and develops unsubstantiated theories about the Zodiac's identity, but a great personal cost.<br /><br />The film has some good performances by Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo as one of the detectives, and Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's wife. But Gyllenhaal is most memorable as the somewhat nerdy, obsessed, and driven character trying to unmask the killer. The film's setting in the Northern California affords some great cinematography work too. On the down side the plot is plodding at times and the ending is somewhat uneventful. It is worth watching if the case interests you, but don't be surprised if you come away somewhat unfulfilled.

B0011UCOGG|5.0|Brisingr was a great addition to the Eragon saga. Full of exciting moments and even more suprises than in Eldest. This was a great read and I recommend it highly for fantasy\sci-fi fans out there.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I just received \\"The Fall\\" in Blu-Ray.I knew nothing about this film untill I read all the great reviews here on Amazon.I was totally blown away from the imagery in this film. This really shows off Blu-ray and Hi Def TV to the utmost. If you only buy one Blu-Ray disc ever, this is the one to get.From the magnificent Black and White opening to the very end scene, my mouth stayed dropped open.
0316143472|2.0|After seeing some of the reviews on Amazon, I'm wondering if I even read the same book as everyone else. Everyone touts David Sedaris as this great comedic writer, and raves that his stream-of-consciousness short stories are hilarious or poignant by turns. There was the odd humorous moment here and there, but I can't say I found this book \\"laugh-out-loud funny\\" at all. Mostly I found it to be a lot of pointless rambling in a person's mind...which is probably fairly realistic, but not particularly interesting to me. Maybe I'm just not cut out for the short story style of writing.
0446691437|5.0|Steven Pressfield hit the nail on the head in his first non-fiction work. He let's everyone who creates anything know that it's not always easy but it is always worth the effort.<br /><br />I'd recommend The War of Art to anyone who is in a small business for themselves or thinking of starting their own business. Writers, entrepreneurs, artists, photographers and CEO's will get a LOT out of the wisdom Pressfield shares.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I really like Jennifer Hudson's debut CD.  There are a variety of types of songs, from one with T-Pain, even Ludacris, to some straight up anthems that I would expect from her. Unlike other reviewers I didn't expect Whitney Houston or anyone else. I think this is a decent CD, definitely worth listening to.
0375826726|5.0|This book has a great story and also has great depth. It answers most of the questions raised in the prior two books. It is a lengthy book, but every page is exciting to read.
0393061310|2.0|Its been a few years since I first read this, and since then a few things started to stick in my craw.<br /><br />Specifically, I'm afraid that Diamond is creating an apologetic treatise on European ethnic cleansing.  He says that the Native Americans died because they didn't have resistance to western diseases.<br />That may be true, but a few points need to be addressed to avoid making apologies for genocide.<br />First, when Europeans encountered these diseases for the first time, the mortality rates where no where near what they were for the Native Americans.<br />Second, he never discussed the fact that disease is a function of famine, and that the Native Americans died soon after being driven from the most fertile lands - often on death marches.<br /><br />It seems criminally irresponsible to me not to address these points.  What would happen to a German author wrote that the victims of the Nazis died mostly from disease and not primarily due to Nazi policies?  In fact, most did die from disease, including Ann Frank and her family who died from TB.<br /><br />Another thing I hate is that he refuses to consider obvious alternatives to his theories of animal domestication.  He claims that all animals that could be domesticated are.  His circular reasoning states this must be true since non domesticated animals aren't domesticated, and no new animals have been domesticated for a few thousand years.<br />But he forgets the opportunity cost argument found in economics.  It could just as easily be true that the effort to domesticate an animal won't be expended because a suitable alternative already exists.  I.e. if I domesticate a zebra to be like a horse, it might take many years, a lot of labor and money.  If there were no competing products (i.e. horses), such a massive expenditure might have paid off in the end.  It's the same reason we don't drive electric cars.  The cost and time associated with making them scale economically must compete against the fact thatwe have already have an economical (though not ecologically) alternative - gas powered cars.
B001AIRUOU|1.0|great movie but bad digital copy.  I have the widescreen vhs version and the dvd here but the movie is out of sync.  There seem to be lines that flash in my copy the tape is ten times better then the dvd so dont buy this one buy the vhs copy in widescreen its so much better.
0938045695|5.0|This book is an excelent introduction to exercising with kettlebells, that is what the name of the book sugests and what Pavel delivers.  I didn't think there is lots of filler information in it and I appreciate the pictures showing the correct and wrong way to do the movements. The exercises are completly diferent from barbells and they can carry you a long way. I have been doing the swings for a few weeks and I can see myself getting better. I like the way the KB seem to not have an end as far as workout, when you can handle the KB for the movements then try to make more repetitions in the same time.  Some may not like the way Pavel writes but I think it has to do with his cultural upbringing, remember he was born in the communist USSR so he does have an authoritary (sometimes) way of saying things.   Does he tell you all he knows in this book? No, this is meant to be an introduction to this type of exercises not to make you an expert at it, I like to keep it simple at the begining, I can always get another book later on.   Pricy? compared to paying a personal trainer, never. When you think about how much you will get out of this book I think it is pretty economic.
B000A2UBN4|2.0|I thought this film was a really bad remake of the great 1962 version.  The 1962 film was much more frightening and intense than the remake, especially the death of Kersek.  In the 1962 version, Robert Mitchum drowns him in the river, where in the remake, Kersek is strangled with a piano wire, which was too gory for me.  I could have done without this.    Even though I like Robert DeNiro, he was not able to carry out the role of Max Cady in the terrifying manner that Robert Mitchum did.    The only good thing about this movie is that three of the original stars of 1962, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam made cameo appearances in this movie.  Robert Mitchum was especially good in the role of the police chief.    I recommend the original 1962 version.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr is definitely the best book so far in what is shaping up to be possibly one of the best fantasy series out there. Young Paolini's in depth characters and ability to weave a driven plot leaves the reader waiting on tenterhooks for the fourth book's release. It's evident in this book that Paolini's writing has greatly improved since Eragon through the way his characters respond to their moral dilemmas and the purpose with which writes the books climax. One of the main themes of this book, as with the others, is Eragon's curiosity of deceased characters such as Brom and Morzan, and the problems he has with his own identity through them. Brisingr further fleshes out the epic tale of Brom and Morzan, and it is a mark of Paolini's skill as an author that he manages to connect the reader to characters who have never appeared in the book. All in all, this was a great read, full of conflict and past enigmas, and a few plot twists, which has the potential to become a classic.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|MAD MEN is one of those series that is almost impossible to praise too highly.  It is also one of those series that puts on display the inherent superiority of television to the movies.  That is a sentiment that I find offends many, but one that more and more thinking men and women are coming to embrace as television gradually turns out one amazingly intelligent series after another.  Cinema is inherently limited on how much an individual movie can achieve in developing a complex narrative just as it is limited in how deeply it can explore character.  The reason is obvious:  a lack of time.  Delving deeply into the lives of a group of characters is a luxury movies simply can't afford.  The clock is ticking.<br /><br />MAD MEN will, when it is finished, be a narrative of the sixties.  Season One begins in 1960k, shortly before the Kennedy-Nixon election.  Season Two moves almost two years ahead of that.  Subsequent seasons will move the story ahead by a couple of years each time, before coming to an end at the end of the decade.  The sixties was clearly the most remarkable decade of the twentieth century.  The world of 1970 has more in common with today in many ways than it did to 1960.  The changes in our attitudes can scarcely be assessed.  At the beginning of the series women all have their place in the office as servants to the men, accept passively their roles as eye candy and objects of sexual innuendo, and aspire to no more than moving up the secretarial rank.  A gay man in the office is so completely in the office that he seems oblivious to his homosexuality.  But by the end of decade would come the Stonewall riots and the Second Wave of the women's movement would be in full bloom.<br /><br />One of the dominant themes of the show is the contrast between the world of today and the world of \\"then.\\"  One of the most striking moments in Season One comes when Betty Draper's daughter runs into the living room wearing a body length plastic launderer's bag.  Betty sharply upbraids her, hoping that this doesn't mean that her laundry is laying on the floor.  To modern sensibility a child wearing a deadly plastic bad is shocking.  Or in a late season episode Don Draper allows his completely drunk boss to leave his house with a drink \\"for the road.\\"  He merely smiles when he shouts, \\"That's my car!\\" as Roger drunkenly tries to find his own.  A pregnant woman at a party can be seen smoking while holding a martini glass.  One of my favorite MAD MEN scenes comes in Season Two, when after a picnic with his wife and kids, Don shakes the blanket they have all been sitting on, leaving the paper and trash on the ground.  It all highlights some of the progress we have made in disciplining some of our more indefensible behavior.<br /><br />As others have noted, the show centers on several ad executives at the Sterling-Cooper advertising firm.  In particular, the film focuses on Don Draper, a brilliantly creative ad exec who has been just as inventive in recreating himself as he has been in promoting the products of the firm's clients.  A serial adulterer, the child of a prostitute who died giving birth to him, and the son of an abusive father, he has had to pull himself from his humble origins to the top of his profession.  All this while protecting his own dark secrets.  Don Draper is a great character, perhaps the most archetypal character to have arisen since Tony Soprano.  And it provided the opportunity for overnight stardom for Jon Hamm, a previously only marginally successful actor who had mainly been distinguished by a string of very small parts on various TV series and small budget movies.  But it is impossible to imagine anyone more perfect for this role than Hamm and series creator Matthew Weiner agreed after seeing his audition tapes.  When the network insisted that Hamm be passed over for a more established actor, Weiner declared that without Hamm he was not willing to move forward with the series.  Weiner won and Hamm went onto win a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination (which he should have won).  As portrayed by Hamm, Don Draper is the complete embodiment of Thoreau's individual who lives a life of quiet desperation.  Draper is a world of contradictions.  At times unscrupulous, he is also capable of great magnanimity and moral rectitude.  A womanizer, he yearns for the ideal home.<br /><br />The cast is stuffed with great characters and wonderful performances.  I absolutely detested Vincent Kartheiser as Connor on the series ANGEL, though even then I suspected it was more the way he was written than his performance.  Though he isn't asked to perform acts of daring do on MAD MEN, he is exceptional as Peter Campbell.  Like Don Draper he alternates from petty, self-serving moments to acts of kindness and loyalty.  He is capable of being wonderfully protective of Peggy Olson, a woman with whom he has had a couple of moments of physical intimacy, though he can also behave viciously towards her.  John Slattery is outstanding as Roger Sterling, the number two man in the firm and the son of the Sterling-Cooper cofounder.  Robert Morse, the great Broadway musical star of the sixties (including HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING), plays Bertram Cooper, the head of the firm.  The almost unbearably beautiful January Jones (at one point in the season much is made of her resemblance to Grace Kelly, and she is gorgeous enough to make it not a silly compliment).  Not to jump ahead to Season Two, Jones performance over the two seasons as Don Draper's trophy wife Betty is noting short of brilliant.  Betty is someone who detests her life as a beautiful manikin, but isn't able to achieve happiness because she doesn't know who she wants to become.  She also provides many of Season One's great moments, none better than when she starts killing the carrier pigeons of her next door neighbor with an air rifle (with cigarette dangling from her mouth) after he tells her children that he will kill their dog if they don't keep him out of his yard.  The gorgeous Christina Hendricks (who wears some padding to make her figure more Rubenesque and who was wonderful in the recurring role of Saffron on the Sci-fi series FIREFLY) plays Joan Holloway, the office manager.<br /><br />After Don Draper, however, my favorite character on the show is Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss).  The series actually begins with Peggy's first day as a Sterling-Cooper employee.  Starting off as Don Draper's secretary, she soon shows that she has skills as a writer, and soon becomes valued as a copy writer with a sensitivity for products that appeal to women.  I've told friends that I believe that by the end of the series Peggy will actually be the head of Sterling-Cooper.  I think the centrality of Peggy to the show was shown partly by the show commencing with her first day there and with her unprecedented penetration of the all male hierarchy of the corporation.  Viewers may notice that she gains weight over the course of the year, especially during the last half.  In fact Elizabeth Moss gained no weight.  All changes were the result of very sophisticated make up art and padded clothing.<br /><br />MAD MEN is one of the most beautifully designed shows you'll ever hope to see.  It may be surpassed by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and PUSHING DAISIES in art design, but no show on television rivals it in clothing.  The look of the show is impeccable.  If you don't remember the sixties, you can relive them by watching this show.<br /><br />This is a show that anyone serious about quality TV has to know well.  I've watched Season One twice and plan on rewatching Season One and Two as soon as the latter has finished.  MAD MEN is also an example of a new trend in television, a series that tells more or less a unified story over the course of its life.  LOST and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA both are doing this as well.  All are must-see shows.and an Emmy nomination (which he should have won).  As portrayed by Hamm, Don Draper is the complete embodiment of Thoreau's individual who lives a life of quiet desperation.

Not to jump ahead to Season Two, Jones performance over the two seasons as Don Draper's trophy wife Betty is noting short of brilliant.  Betty is someone who detests her life as a beautiful manikin, but isn't able to achieve happiness because she doesn't know who she wants to become.  She also provides many of Season One's great moments, none better than when she starts killing the carrier pigeons of her next door neighbor with an air rifle (with cigarette dangling from her mouth) after he tells her children that he will kill their dog if they don't keep him out of his yard.  The gorgeous Christina Hendricks (who wears some padding to make her figure more Rubenesque and who was wonderful in the recurring role of Saffron on the Sci-fi series FIREFLY) plays Joan Holloway, the office manager.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|I don't really know why I like Death Proof as much as I do. I mean, this movie has a storyline barely enough to make a 30-minute TV episode. But Tarantino made a 90-minute movie out of it - and a very satisfying one at that. You will notice its scrathcy print, imperfect sound, sloppy editing and switch between color and black & white. But please keep in mind that all that is done on purpose. Why? Because this is not a regular movie. Its a parody of the kind of B-grade movies commonly shown in drive-in theaters during the late 60's to early 70's. Such theaters were known as Grindhouse. This movie goes out of its way to give you that authentic old-B-grade-movies-from-60's feel and look. Death Proof's beginning is very boring but necessary. It gradually starts building your excitement towards the middle and by the end it gives a very solid adrenaline rush. If you like voluptuous females and car chases, give it a shot. You might like it too!
B0017JKEL8|5.0|MAD MEN is one of those series that is almost impossible to praise too highly.  It is also one of those series that puts on display the inherent superiority of television to the movies.  That is a sentiment that I find offends many, but one that more and more thinking men and women are coming to embrace as television gradually turns out one amazingly intelligent series after another.  Cinema is inherently limited on how much an individual movie can achieve in developing a complex narrative just as it is limited in how deeply it can explore character.  The reason is obvious:  a lack of time.  Delving deeply into the lives of a group of characters is a luxury movies simply can't afford.  The clock is ticking.<br /><br />MAD MEN will, when it is finished, be a narrative of the sixties.  Season One begins in 1960k, shortly before the Kennedy-Nixon election.  Season Two moves almost two years ahead of that.  Subsequent seasons will move the story ahead by a couple of years each time, before coming to an end at the end of the decade.  The sixties was clearly the most remarkable decade of the twentieth century.  The world of 1970 has more in common with today in many ways than it did to 1960.  The changes in our attitudes can scarcely be assessed.  At the beginning of the series women all have their place in the office as servants to the men, accept passively their roles as eye candy and objects of sexual innuendo, and aspire to no more than moving up the secretarial rank.  A gay man in the office is so completely in the office that he seems oblivious to his homosexuality.  But by the end of decade would come the Stonewall riots and the Second Wave of the women's movement would be in full bloom.<br /><br />One of the dominant themes of the show is the contrast between the world of today and the world of \\"then.\\"  One of the most striking moments in Season One comes when Betty Draper's daughter runs into the living room wearing a body length plastic launderer's bag.  Betty sharply upbraids her, hoping that this doesn't mean that her laundry is laying on the floor.  To modern sensibility a child wearly a deadly plastic bad is shocking.  Or in a late season episode Don Draper allows his completely drunk boss to leave his house with a drink \\"for the road.\\"  He merely smiles when he shouts, \\"That's my car!\\" as Roger drunkenly tries to find his own.  A pregnant woman at a party can be seen smoking while holding a martini glass.  One of my favorite MAD MEN scenes comes in Season Two, when after a picnic with his wife and kids, Don shakes the blanket they have all been sitting on, leaving the paper and trash on the ground.  It all highlights some of the progress we have made in discipling some of our more indefensible behavior.<br /><br />As others have noted, the show centers on several ad executives at the Sterling-Cooper advertising firm.  In particular, the film focuses on Don Draper, a brilliantly creative ad exec who has been just as inventive in recreating himself as he has been in promoting the products of the firm's clients.  A serial adulterer, the child of a prostitute who died giving birth to him, and the son of an abusive father, he has had to pull himself from his humble origins to the top of his profession.  All this while protecting his own dark secrets.  Don Draper is a great character, perhaps the most archetypal character to have arisen since Tony Soprano.  And it provided the opportunity for overnight stardom for Jon Hamm, a previously only marginally successful actor who had mainly been distinguished by a string of very small parts on various TV series and small budget movies.  But it is impossible to imagine anyone more perfect for this role than Hamm and series creator Matthew Weiner agreed after seeing his audition tapes.  When the network insisted that Hamm be passed over for a more established actor, Weiner declared that without Hamm he was not willing to move forward with the series.  Weiner won and Hamm went on towin a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination (which he should have won).  As portrayed by Hamm, Don Draper is the complete embodiment of Thoreau's individual who lives a life of quiet desperation.  Draper is a world of contraditions.  At times unscrupulous, he is also capable of great magnanimity and moral rectitude.  A womanizer, he yearns for the ideal home.<br /><br />The cast is stuffed with great characters and wonderful performances.  I absolutely detested Vincent Kartheiser as Connor on the series ANGEL, though even then I suspected it was more the way he was written than his performance.  Though he isn't asked to perform acts of daring do on MAD MEN, he is exceptional as Peter Campbell.  Like Don Draper he alternates from petty, self-serving moments to acts of kindness and loyalty.  He is capable of being wonderfully protective of Peggy Olson, a woman with whom he has had a couple of moments of physical intimacy, though he can also behave viciously towards her.  John Slattery is outstanding as Roger Sterling, the number two man in the firm and the son of the Sterling-Cooper cofounder.  Robert Morse, the great Broadway musical star of the sixties (including HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING), plays Betram Cooper, the head of the firm.  The almost unbearably beautiful January Jones (at one point in the season much is made of her resemblence to Grace Kelly, and she is gorgeous enough to make it not a silly compliment).  Not to jump ahead to Season Two, Jones performance over the two seasons as Don Draper's trophy wife Betty is noting short of brilliant.  Betty is someone who detests her life as a beautiful manikin, but isn't able to achieve happiness because she doesn't know who she wants to become.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|After viewing this movie, I had to learn all about it's wonderful actor, Mr. Richard Armitage, came to learn that North & South was never meant to even be on DVD, but this was SUCH a hit in England, that the BBC Message board literally CRASHED on the count of all the women who was posting about Thorton/Richard. How funny is that! The ending is purely delightful.  Darcy (Pride & Predjiduce) was great, but Thorton is way above, he delivers one kiss you will not soon forget, I would rate the most passionate kiss in a Period Drama scene -Ever to date.

0143038419|5.0|This is a wonderful inspirational book - I felt like I was going through the travels and the journey with her.  I related to a lot of the things that she had and was experiencing in her life.  Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.
0810994739|5.0|So i bought this book for my daughter's birthday and she told me mom thank you and thank you very much for the book and after she was done she was like wow what a great book and that's kind of what like life is like she said that there was a lot of humerious jokes in there!!!
0375831002|4.0|This is the strangest book I have ever read.  The phrasing, word pictures and narrative form are exceptional (and sometimes unfathonable) and take some concentration to understand.  Some parts have to be re-read to get the meaning and sometimes I never did get the meaning. This book makes you think and I am glad I read it. I went immediately and got another novel by this author.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Madonna's new cd is a combination of old and new sounds. My favorite songs on this cd are incredible and give it to me. I'm a die hard Madonna fan, but this cd isn't quite five star worthy.
0439023483|5.0|Stephenie is my favorite author and she recommended this book to all her fans and boy she didn't disappoint ! I LOVE THIS BOOK AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT FOR YOURSELF !!!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|People might think this is Madonna's attempt at a hip hop album because of '4 Minutes', but this CD offers a huge array of sound. The urban producers who Madonna brought in to make this project actually manupulated their sound toward her style, and it works great! There are a lot of hot beats and synths in this album, and Madonna always sings a fun melody. My favourite tracks are Give it 2 me, Miles Away, Heartbeat, Incredible, Beat Goes On, Dance 2night, Devil Wouldn't Recgonize you, and Voices... excellent work again Madonna!
B001GNRNQE|5.0|Very impressive for a debut album it has 13 tracks and 12 are good the im not in to is  the one with ludacris im defiently getting this album 2 copies  highly recommended.
0142412147|5.0|It's Christmas Eve, and one of the biggest storms in memory has hit, isolating tiny Gracetown, Virginia. For Jubilee, Tobin, and Addie the storm will bring them together in the most unconventional of ways. Jubilee, on her way to Florida, is stranded outside of Gracetown when her train gets stuck in the snow. Rather than endure Christmas Eve night on the train with a mass of perky cheerleaders, she ventures out and heads to the nearby Waffle House, where she encounters Stuart, who is still nursing a broken heart.     Tobin and his friends JP and the Duke are enjoying their Christmas Eve holed up at Tobin's house and watching a James Bond movie marathon when they are enticed out into the night to the local Waffle House. What should be a twenty minute drive on a clear night turns into a crazy race to get there before the intimidating Reston twins...but when they get there things don't go quite how they planned.     For Addie, the holidays have been filled with misery since she and her boyfriend Jeb broke up. But this year she'll gain some perspective (and possibly more) during one very long and very snowy shift at Starbucks the day after Christmas.     All three stories are cleverly woven together, along with each author's inimitable style and brand of humor. The wholly unique, ironic, witty, intelligent, and heartfelt plots that Myracle, Johnson, and Green have become well known for is strongly present in Let It Snow. The varying and colorful characters are authentic and highly realistic, allowing for the book to appeal to a wide range of reader interests. The dialogue, the jokes, the slang, and actions are all pitch perfect to this generation, and wildly appealing, even as they push the limits of reality. But even so, most readers will be more than willing to hold on tight and enjoy the ride as this sweet and sarcastically funny holiday read unravels.
0307455378|5.0|The book is very good, even if not nearly as great as the shadow. I feel the author wanted to make the book longer, but he was probably stopped by the editors.   If you liked the shadow you should definitely read it, even if the tone of the book seems more sad I suppose. You will see some characters from the shadow that will make the book more fun, so don't read it unless you have read the shadow of the wind.   enjoy it!
0525478183|5.0|To everyone who surrounds Margo Roth Spiegelman, she is an adventurous, unconventional, and intelligent person and a highly admired someone that everyone puts on a pedestal. So when Margo sneaks into Quentin Jacobsen's room one glorious night and involves him in her crazy exploits, he can't help but feel as if a new page has been turned, and just maybe he can be a part of the marvelous Margo's life.    But the next morning all of Quentin's hopes are dashed with Margo's disappearance. Her parents and the police think this is just another one of her stunts, but Q's not so sure. Because Margo has left him a string of clues, one right after another, which just might lead him to her. But the thing is, he's not sure what he'll find.    John Green brings readers another surprising, witty, and fully honest book in Paper Towns. His writing is captivating from the very beginning as multitudes of details, no mater how large of small, flow seamlessly together. Green has a knack for highlighting the little distinguishing factors that make us human, making for more believable characters and completely enthralling book.     The mystery in Paper Towns is clever, and will leave readers scratching their heads as Q and his friends struggle to piece together the clues with some frustration and tons of humor. But the teens are just as quick to get serious as they contemplate what has actually happened to Margo and as Quentin especially comes to see her in a completely different light with a little help from the poetry of Walt Whitman.     Though Paper Towns did slow down a little bit in the middle of the book as Quentin hits a brick wall in his search, this novel is suspenseful, hilarious, and quirky, and especially appealing to the well read teen. The characters are as real as your own friends, and teens can't help but see pieces of their own lives in this amazingly candid book. Read at your own risk though--Green's works are completely addictive, and once you start, it's impossible tostop.
0385340990|5.0|This book is a good read, i.e., once you start it you won't want to put it down.  And from begining to end, you'll feel good.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|We all knew this was going to be great but we also felt the same thing for spider man 3.  Now this is a movie, great acting, effects, actors, villans, the works.  This movie is so good i think i will buy both versions, ultimate and 2 disc.  If it comes out again next year, i will make another purchase.  It was like seeing movies like sixth sense for the first time, with regards to such a outstanding movie that came out of nowehere.  Batman Begins was great also, but this was sooo much better.  I know it will be sold out everywhere.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|First off, let me say that I'm a fan of every Kings of Leon cd, with Because of the Times being my favorite. That being said, I find this new album to be a step backwards. The songs are very short, the guitar interplay is much simpler than on previous albums, and the production has a very fuzzy, raw quality which, in this case, doesn't work well for me. It's not a bad cd, just not great. On the plus side, the vocals sound better than ever and the drummer sounds excellent. I hope they take more time with their next album. (There is one great song... \\"Crawl\\")!
0060989157|5.0|Certainly, will be more enjoyable for Crue fans. However, I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not being entertained.
0738702994|5.0|I have been through several other tarot decks in my quest to learn to read the cards. None have spoken to me the ways these cards have. The illustrations are inspiring and the Welsh mythology stories that accompany the major arcana are wonderful. They bring to life the cards and make it much easier to understand the myriad of meanings that the cards hold much more easily than memorizing key words. What I was most impressed by was that there were no cards that I disliked. I typically do not like the death card (the illustration, not the meaning), the sun card, and sometimes a few others. In this deck, all are visually appealing. Also noteworthy is the detail and skill the illustrator shows in conveying the expressions and, what I feel, are the thoughts of the human figures in the cards. Truly amazing!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a wonderful book! I find myself recommending it to people all the time. It touches you, makes you smile and sad and read in anticipation of whatever will come next. It is not your typical World war 2 horror story but you feel the horror in nearly every chapter. Read it and you find yourself with the urge to share it with everybody you know.
0060763892|3.0|This was my first James Rollins book and i do have to say that overall i enjoyed the book very much. So how come it only got 3 stars? well true believers read on to find out.<br /><br />With out ruining the plot of the book to much lets say that it involves a Bio-Terrorist group, a covert government agency, a world ending virus, a famous explorer and of course completely over the top action.<br /><br />This book will keep you very entertained if your an action junkie. Most of the action is completely over the top that it becomes kinda silly. This was pretty much the downfall of the book for me. I love action as much as the next guy but when \\"Secret agents/scientists/scholars\\" can do everything from deciphering century old puzzles in one breath and dodging rockets a second later it kinda gets ridicules. I mean one guy even has a prosthetic hand that can clamp down with superhuman strength.<br /><br />But if you can look past the cheesy action sequences you will find a truly compelling story involving a very well known explorer....it should be noted though that the characters in this book have stared in a book from this author once before and a few references were made to past relationships. I think the book is called \\"Map Of Bones\\". However since this is the first James Rollins book that i have read, i cant really say should read the other book first. After i read it ill let you know!
B001AW9DKK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Deja Vu Live. The music is excellent. It reveals the band members' enthusiasm and true belief (particulary that of Neil Young) of what they're trying to get across.  I admire they they're taking a stand. This country is really screwed up, and somebody has to stand up and say something!
B000FA57RG|4.0|I'm Going To Tell You a Secret by Madonna is a CD/DVD combo following the Queen of Pop on her Re-Invention Tour in 2004. Madonna is a stunning performer, no one does it better than her. Vogue, Crazy For You, and Nobody Knows Me are some of the tracks I enjoy. Backstage footage is also shown and many more. Highly recommend for Madge fans only, enjoy!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Awesome show, amazing package, you get a sweet box and all of the episodes of Alias with special features, it's perfect.
B000002LCD|4.0|Who's That Girl is the ultimate Madonna soundtrack. There are 4 original songs that Madonna sings which include: Who's That Girl, Can't Stop, Causing a Commotion, and The Look of Love. The last song I have mentioned is Madonna's most beautiful ballad of the '80s, too bad it was never released as a single. I highly recommend this fabulous purchase if you are a huge Madonna fan like myself. Enjoy!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Don't trust the other negative reviews! This is a great series and well worth the $18.00 bucks.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|basically the reason for this movie's existence is that sony acquired the rights to the beatles songs a few years ago.  The 50-50 joint venture -- Sony/ATV Music Publishing -- owns rights to more than 250 Beatles songs.    sony also owns columbia pictures, which made Across the Universe.    so basically all this movie is is a device to popularise the beatles back-catalogue to make some cash for sony, which is stuggling a little in today's download culture.    all Across the Universe wants to do is remind you of the beatles and their tracks - which it does by cramming/culling as many of their songs into the running time as possible - so you go out and buy them.    which is why this movie is bereft of a decent storyline, decent singing, and very little charm and none of the creativity for which the beatles were famous.    I don't think the filmmakers care if Across The Universe sucks or not - Julie Taymor was replaced by the studio and the film was recut by Sony itself to its own specifications - as long as it gets the punters to fork out for old beatles tracks.    Across the Universe is just a cheap and nasty exploitation movie.  fortunately it was not very successful. [[ASIN:B0006383ZK Bowl Brush Holder]][[ASIN:B000KKKPTG STAINLESS TOILET BRUSH W/STAND]]
0375826726|3.0|I don't know why this day and age expects everyone to go to the web to find out the latest; supposedly the change in book numbers was announced on CP's website. All I know is that after finishing brsingr, I felt like I was robbed, bait-and-switch, made a dupe of the marketing machine.  I was fully expecting a climactic finish, a feature length movie, wrapped all up nice and neat after waiting nearly 3 years.    Instead of a feature length movie, I get a someone's vacation slide show.     Each chapter tries to create a picture, there's a lot of commentary about each picture, but in the end, like the vacation slide show, you wonder what did I just see...there's no real thread to tie it all together. A lot of pretty pictures, some in focus, some not, but no real story.  Sooo many chapters devoted to things that don't seem to have any reason for moving the story forward except to expound on the various societal aspects of the different races and how they are different from one another. You think you're going down a path to reach a conclusion but then you just move to the next picture in the slide show. No reason for even reading the last chapter...what was the point of the last chapter?  Very disappointing.    Am I going to wait another couple years for the conclusion???  Do you want your uncle to show you that slide show of their vacation again???

0375826726|5.0|I loved Brisingr. I had just finished reading Naomi Novik's books about dragons then came back over to Brisingr after a long wait between books. Eldest was still the best of the 3. I still consider it a great read. Very interesting how he includes the politics of each race.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|Both volumes look great on blu-ray, i recomend to anyone whos looking to upgrade their blu-ray collection, these would be a great addition!!!
B001CD6FKI|4.0|Speed Racer was unfairly blasted by stuffy critics and fans alike.I disagree with em all,This movie really retains the spirit of the Original Classic Cartoon<br />The cast is all very good,Fox as Racer X steals the Movie in my humble opinion.He chews up the screen.For me who grew up watching the Original..I really loved it!
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I watched this show primarily because it was made by the producers of Doctor Who.  The show starts off with a good concept and some very intriguing story lines.  However, after half-way through the season it appears that all of the characters are nothing but shallow sex-craved individuals with little moral character.  The stories appear to be just written around an excuse to get the characters into compromising positions.  If this series was a typical prime-time drama that would be expected but since it is supposed to be a science fiction series I would expect a little more of a plot.  In the end I found myself fast-forwarding through the episodes just to get to the end and see how things turned out.  I will not even bother watching Season 2.

B000002QWD|5.0|You can never go wrong with Bing. Better even than Sinatra in my opinion.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Christmas albums. Bing's voice is so rich and warm, it can't help but put you in the mood for the holidays.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|After crashing on the scene with three comparatively rowdy albums (KoL are huge in the UK) the boys seem to have relaxed and settled down with this one, a very self-assured and mature album it is too, not one that hits you in the balls but thoughtful and professional. The sound quality on my vinyl copy is stunningly clear and natural sounding - a treat to have the guys sitting playing in my living room, it's that good!   The playing is as assured as always whether live or on record, this could be considered their best album to date, the chemistry within the group is amazing, i hope they stay around for many years to come!
B00005JPO1|1.0|I went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. And I'm sorry, I had no idea that I was WATCHING STARGATE 2!!! Or maybe A.I. or E.T.'s GRANDPARENTS!!!!<br /><br />I know the movie had something to do with Indiana Jones because I could have sworn I saw Harrison Ford in there somewhere. However, I kept waiting for the Stargate-SG1 team to appear because surely this was some SG1 movie I somehow didn't find out about. It had to be one of those adventures where they went back in time. A used but sometimes acceptable plot device.<br /><br />At some points I thought I must have been watching Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow because of all the glowy effects they used in this movie to cover up the fake looking jeep/fencing scene. Remember when they actually blew stuff up in movies. Actually had stunt men fighting on actual ground. I'm pretty sure an ancient episode of MacGuyver had ants attacking a town that LOOKED REAL!<br /><br />So it must have been every other movie I was watching except Indiana Jones. I see...that must be it. Because seriously!!?? Freaking aliens!?<br /><br />Maybe I was watching another Star Wars movie that was all about Han Solo. Who started wearing a hat. And carrying a whip. Yeah that must be it.<br /><br />You know, for an Indiana Jones movie, it just didn't cut it. I liked those movies for the fact that they were believable. I could see Indy running from tribesmen and giant boulders. Or stopping a mining cart with his boot heels. A stretch yes but within the realm. I watch those movies for adventure. They're fun and the archeology is based at least in some reality. Lending credit to the story.<br /><br />I saw Close Encounters Of the Third Kind once. I just didn't know I was watching it's sequel.<br /><br />And I'm starting to get tired of special effects. Granted the effects are fantastical, but they're fantastical for a cartoon. You have to let me know when I'm watching a cartoon or I feel a little robbed. Like when I realized Attack of the Clones was basically a giant cartoon.<br /><br />Special effects are starting to look, at least to me, too artificial. I know movies are exactly that but they try to play at being real. There's too much use of the Green Screen. Actors and objects react differently with things in real life. Sun, wind, random movements - they add depth to movies that blue screens can't. Just sayin'.<br /><br />And the plot was a bit disappointing. It's like Speilberg and Lucas had all the action shots mapped out but not the binding agent as to how they all fit together. And George Lucas must have been stumbling drunk because when Speilberg said let's string it all together by putting aliens in it, he had to have coerced Lucas into signing a cocktail napkin contract that he lamented when he sobered up.  Because Speilberg is a sneaky one.<br /><br />Lucas: \\"I don't know Steve, aliens? You think the fans'll go for it [hic]?\\"<br />Speilberg: \\"No! Dude! It'll work...cause see, man, by the time they're invested an hour in the movie, they can't leave cause they spent $10 bucks a ticket. Trust me mannnnn...has anotherz shot mannnn.\\"<br />Lucas: \\"Mmmm tequila. But a deformed monkey skull thatz magnetic to glud...glod...gold! It's filled with bubble wrap dude, wherez the brain go!?\\"<br />Speilberg: \\"Screw the brain cavity man, they'll never notice becuase we'll make it glow! No! We'll fill it with tiny little galaxies and starz mannz. They'll never notize. Yeah!!\\"<br />Lucas: \\"Okay....here's you're napkin back by the way.\\"<br />Speilberg: \\"Dude! Do me a wookie roar!\\"<br />Lucas: \\"Naw man. Don't be silly.\\"<br />Speilberg: \\"C'mon man! For me dude! I love it when you do the wookie!\\"<br />Lucas: *some weird drunken gargling sound* \\"Howz?\\"--*crash*<br />Speilberg: \\"Aw dayyyymm. He passed out. Barkeep! Can I get another tequila? Thank aliens he signed my napkin!\\"<br /><br />BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE MADE SENSE TO PUT ALIENS IN AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE!!!ok, at least to me, too artificial.

B00005JPS8|5.0|I've never really read much of the iron man comic. I limit myself to a few titles because if left unrestrained I would go into debt via comic shop.<br /><br />So I can't attest to the authenticity of character portrayal. Though friends who do read the comic say it's close enough.<br /><br />With all that, in my opinion, this movie was a great super hero movie. I really loved the two new Batman movies but have heard some people argue that Begins was a little slow. And while I can see what they're talking about, it didn't seem boring to me.<br /><br />Meaning: I like that they're doing these origin movies. Iron man could have been a flop but it wasn't. I looked at my watch afterwards and thought, holy crap, that was 2 hours!? There was absolutely no chance to be bored in this film.<br /><br />The movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. I had my doubts about Downey Jr pulling off the role. And let's be honest, it was Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr. It was a perfect role for him. He made the character believable.<br /><br />That I didn't realize time had passed is the best compliment I can give this movie. Unlike the Matthew Broderick Godzilla a few years back where I looked at my watch and realized it had only been twenty minutes into my suffering.<br /><br />My copy of the DVD is on it's way to me so I can't attest to the special features. I'll try and review them when I've watched them.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, rent it and see. But I don't think you'll be disappointed. Buy it so they'll continue to make movies of this caliber.
0141439513|5.0|There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner.  There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.<br /><br />It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be \\"a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.<br /><br />I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This review is gonna get lost in the shuffle. Oh, well.<br /><br />This movie lived up to the hype. I got to see one of the early cuts in the theater before it was released. It had no music or credits. One of the special features on the DVD is Joss Weedon's preamble before those screenings. It's ridiculously funny. But then it's Joss; he's ridiculously funny.<br /><br />If you're a Firefly fan, you should love this. Even with what he does to the characters, the writing was superb and made the movie that much more dramatic.<br /><br />I've also got to say that if you're not a fan, you can still enjoy the movie and never see the series. I have friends who were introduced to Firefly through Serenity and have since bought their own copies. Everyone who has borrowed it from me has gotten their own.<br /><br />Weedon's ability to mix humor into very serious material is remarkable. He'll make you laugh, cry and clench  your fist in almost the same breath. It's a gift.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have about the film is that the FX in the chase scene with the hover craft and the Reaver ship, didn't look real. It was surprising for otherwise fantastic FX sequences.<br /><br />This is rambling, I know. Suffice it to say that you'll thoroughly enjoy this as a Sci-Fi movie. It's got all the classic parts. It rivals even Star Wars (OT) in my heart.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have watched the A&E film version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" more times than may seem reasonable.  However, this is really a fantastic production that is true to the novel without being overburdened by the text.  The acting is superb and truly brings Austen's characters to life, especially Mr. Darcy played admirably by Colin Firth.  You will not be sorry you purchased this film nor regret the 6 hours it takes to reach the end.
B000021YQV|5.0|I'm not much into speed metal, nu-metal or death metal. I like music that plays great and lyrics that make sense. After hearing Chop Suey and Toxicity, I knew I had to have this CD. Upon listening to the entire CD and comparing the lyrics and sheet music, I rated this as one of the best CD's to come along since Rush's Moving Pictures. As for it being catagorized as nu-metal, Amazon should replace who ever does that job. This is far from being nu-metal. It's more of a fusion of modern metal and progressive rock, leaning more toward the later. My suggestion is to add this to your collection. You won't be sorry.
B00006AG5N|5.0|The 30 #1 singles on this CD were #1 in either the U.S. the U.K or both.  I understand, as the liner notes explain, that they stuck strictly to the \\"Pop\\" chart #1 singles and didn't attempt to included songs that hit #1 on the U.S. Country charts and/or R&B charts as it would exceed a single disc format.  Nevertheless, there is one very big #1 Elvis \\"Pop\\" single in the U.S. that is not on this set but is saved for the follow up CD \\"2nd to None\\".  The song is \\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\\"  It is on the the \\"Number Ones\\" CD from 1987.   On the \\"Top Ten Hits\\" cd from 1987 it shows the songs highest chart peak  as # 1 with the month and year.  I understand that they may have had to sacrafice at least one #1 single for this 30 song set, but seeing as how \\"Wooden Heart\\" which was #1 in the U.K. but not even a hit of any kind in the U.S., is on this set, it seems that \\"Wooden Heart\\" could have been left off and saved for 2nd to None instead of \\"I want you, I need you, I love you\\" which was #1 in the U.S. and and # 14 in the U.K.  Then when you consider that \\"Burning Love\\" was not #1 in the U.K. and actually a #2 song in the U.S. according to Billboard but makes this set because it hit # 1 in the U.S. on the Cash Box chart, then it is even more unfair as \\"I want you , I need you, I love you\\", actually hit # 1 on Billborad.  I understand that \\"Burning Love\\" adds more weight to the 70's songs on the set and I'm not assuming that Billboard is better than Cash Box but every other #1 U.S. song on this set was #1 on Billboard and RCA does not include \\"Burning Love\\" on the \\"Number Ones\\" cd form '87 and on \\"The Top Ten Hits\\" CD from '87 they list it as #2.  Still a great collection, but the fact remains that of Elvis Presley's five #1 songs in the U.S. in 1956, one of them is not on this collection.
B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music's Avalon is a remarkable record both in it's songs and the fact that  often makes me wonder what would have been next had they continued, but they left on a high note.    This record is steller from the first track to the last and the songs are just beautiful.  More Than This, Avalon, Take a Chance With Me and To Turn You On melt mmy heart.      Turn down the lights and listen, it is a special experience.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Death Magnetic is no Master of Puppets. But it is at least an improvement of Metallica's more recent works, like Reload and St. Anger. Finally we're back on track. With Death Magnetic, Metallica has finally sealed the deal on their claim as the greatest metal band ever.
B0013LPS8E|4.0|This is one of U2's best albums. Almost every song is great and 3 were hit singles, including Sunday, Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day and Two Hearts. New Year's Day has become a radio staple classic and is still fresh 20-something years later. I bought this cd for the remastering and I wasn't disappointed, the remastering is excellent. I would rank U2s albums in the following order.    Achtung Baby  All That You Can't Leave Behind  No Line On The Horizon  How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb  The Joshua Tree  Pop  War  The Unforgettable Fire    If I didn't list it then I didn't care for it much. I'm talking to you Zooropa, October, Rattle & Hum and Boy. Those albums all have their respective moments but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone but hardcore fans.    For those of you that have never listened to War, you are in for a pleasant surprise. It was one of their most MOR(Middle of the Road) albums and it features their trademark anti-war protest lyrics. Very accessible, original music. One of the classic cd's of the 80's New Wave movement and a huge influence on other bands at the time.
B001D08SK0|1.0|Another rip-off reissue!  How many more times can they repackage this classic? : (1.) original off-pitch LP with miss-titled tracks (All Blues/Flamenco Sketches) , (2.) off-pitch LP with miss-titles corrected (except in Europe!), (3.) off-pitch CD issue, (4.) correct pitch CD reissue, (5.) CD digital remaster with bonus out-take, (6.) Davis/Coltrane box set, (7.) SACD, (8.) HQ LP.    Now a reissue which includes (5.) & (8.) plus a (9.) CD in session order including breakdowns and studio chat.  This latest CD has been available as a bootleg for years - it is really only for obsessives (like me) and is not particularly interesting except that it shows how quickly they created this masterpiece.  But why an LP and CD? Any music listener with a quality sound system and good ears will always prefer CDs despite the variable remastering.  LPs are for retro listeners who prefer the sound of vinyl.  The markets do not overlap!  Every time I put on an LP to transfer to digital I wince at the noise - clunk-shoop-shoop-shoop-crackle-shoop-click- music-click-music-crackle etc etc.    Do not buy this - get the boot of the full session from the net and listen for interest.  Issue (5.) has great sound and if you have a SACD player and surround sound sound system get the SACD to listen to a transfer of the 3 channel master recording (turn off the rear channels).    The DVD has also been around for many years in much less expensive issues and only includes 'So What'! Hardly 'Kind of Blue Live'
B0019FOC5E|5.0|A fun movie to watch, more of a chick flick.  Even the next day I felt happy. Tunes keep running through my head anf feel energized.
0439023483|1.0|Seriously?? People, Suzanne Collins is stealing ideas from different books and movies and piecing them together, creating \\"something completely new.\\" Come on. When I read this book, the only thing I could think was, \\"Hmm, where have I seen THIS before? OH YEAH, \\"Battle Royale\\" by Koushun Takami, \\"The Long Walk\\" by Steven King, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, the movie The Condemned, et cetera.\\" This is plagiarism at its worst, I mean this book has been written a thousand times, and she didn't even try to change any circumstances.    ...And now she is being recognized as inspirational, bringing a \\"completely new concept\\" of kids killing kids?? IT'S BEEN DONE! It disgusts me that no one has sued her for this second-rate version of amazing literature. Also, if she's going to completely steal their story lines, she could at least do it well; Her writing is terrible.    Not only that, but she's using a textbook example of a dystopian society. Like, there's not a thing that makes this society new or different. It's all so cliche! Can't she think of a single new concept? I mean, putting things in the blender isn't a skill.    Well, that pretty much ends my rant. Please, if you're going to buy something, buy an original! Try Battle Royale, that's a personal favorite of mine, but whatever you do, don't buy this unoriginal cra p.    Congratulations, Suzanne! You've just proven that idiots without brains in their heads can be successful too!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|This album is something buy. IMO I really don't see anything wrong with how the production of this album went. I think Jennifer & her producers put out great tracks. Jennifer didn't imitate anyone on this album. A lot of people wanted to hear a Whitney sound or a Aretha sound but your not gonna get that your gonna get Jennifer Hudson. Listeners should want to hear Jennifer and not Whitney or Aretha. This album has her own style and own stamp of what R&B is all about. This album is not about duplicating what we get from Whitney when she first came to the scene or Aretha. It's Jennifer Hudson as her own and before you write it off as bad you really need to hear the album looking for Jennifer not other music legends.     Key songs like \\"Invisible\\" & \\"Giving Myself\\" are real listen too's and should not be skipped when listening. Emotion comes out from Jennifer in these songs and I've been blown away.\\"We Gon Fight\\" is another example of something we really don't get from current R&B. She brings something different to the table that I haven't heard in a long time from anyone. And \\"Pocketbook\\" gives off that sassiness that I've seen in Jennifer since she was on AI. For me definitely a club banger or a morning work-out song. And the duet with Fantasia \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" for me injects thats same flavor into music that we got from the collab of Brandy/Monica but it's majority captures the essence of the song \\"Woman to Woman\\" which is also something that many fans of that song will love. For me the only song that could have been left out was the duet with T-Pain, other than that it a great debut for the Oscar winner. I bought two copies. For you to enjoy this album you really need to sit down and listen to the whole thing like I did and I was blown away.     SO again don't expect a imitation of Whitney's first album or Aretha because you're gonna get Jennifer and that is who your focus should be on.
B0016CZKX8|3.0|As far as reading the text goes, it's easy to read.  It's just like any other version of Austen that I have read.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I do want to make a very important point for those considering this version and others by this company.  The pictures really ruin the flow of the book.  You will be reading, then there is a huge blank space after the text.  Click next page and you get a picture that is really hard to get a look at, then next page you see the caption and some space before the text continues.  It really disrupts the reading to have this randomly throughout the chapters.<br /><br />Aside from that, the kindle version is decent.
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|If you're looking for something different, thought provoking, inventive, and fun, This is a good album to get. The trick is to listen to it a few times because the sound (or style) is weird. To my ears and soul, this is not Led-Zeppelin's weaker second term. It is completely different than anything that you can find anywhere in music. Robert Plant's love for music and dedication to finding cool new sounds is stamped on every track. You will listen to this for years and love it more every time you listen to it.
B0013RV3PK|5.0|Just to note: This review is of the Almost Sunday Publishing kindle edition.<br /><br />If you are like me, you want to buy books at the cheapest price you can get, while still getting good quality.  Good news!  The kindle version of this book is flawless as far as I can tell.  It is simply the text, with chapters that you can jump to.  There are NO annoying pictures among the text at all.<br /><br />The story itself is VERY good, and easy to read even though it was written over 200 years ago.  I found it very amusing to read Emma's antics, and I could definitely relate to her and the other characters.  For more on the plot, you can easy look at the other versions.<br /><br />The bottom-line is if you are looking for Austen for a low price, this one is the way to go!
0143038419|3.0|the first chapter was so, so, The second chapter a little more enlightening, the third,  wellllll . Not sure what this book was suppose to inspire me about? Would return it, if possible.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|Jeez, everyone wants Sadeness and Return To Innocence all the time! Well listen to them and let the bias go! Yes, it was a magical time then. How many \\"artists\\" junped on the bandwagon and went so far as to even steal the Enigma beat?! (Delerium, anyone?) This is the Cretu we have all loved and needed for 18yrs now. This is simply the best Enigma (or anything like it) product in years! True fans rejoice! Cretu is still the Father of our most beloved music. Buy it! Remember Enigma 3? This is it for 2008.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is one of the best made films I've seen in my lifetime. Catinca and Lee really make the movie, but there is no shortage of excellent cinematography. Spectacular scenery and breathtaking shots make this film a good (and much needed) departure from the formulaic dramas around now. I'm not going to lie... it made me cry like a baby. This movie pulls you into the story, expertly weaving fantasy with reality. 6/5 stars.
0375826726|3.0|This was a good book.  I like stories about magic, which is why I wrote \\"Sorcery at Caesars\\" - a true story about a boxer whose victory over a fierce opponent was real magic.  In 1987, Sugar Ray Leonard was the boxing version of Brisingr.
0307455874|5.0|I enjoyed listening to Obama's first book on CD, \\"Dreams of My Father.\\"  I respected how honest he was about his struggles of growing up, being raised by a white mother and grandparents, but appearing black to others.  Dreams of my father was about his childhood and early adult years.  Now that the election is close, I wanted to know more about his political positions, so this was exactly that.      I view myself as a logical, sensible person, so I connected with this book.  The story gives a good historical overview of politics from what we could read in textbooks, in addition to the inside scoop and a veiwpoint from someone with a law degree, professor and U.S. Senator.      I'm a pediatric nurse, so I am very aware of the greatness and downfalls of our medical system.  People may not believe the stories like he told; the man who had been a foreman at the closed steel plant, lost his health care coverage, was willing to and would be forced to sell everything so his son could get a needed liver transplant.  For middle-class America, those stories are plenty.      This book was on the dry side compared to Dreams of my father, but it was about politics!  It was more interesting than any other poliitcal book I've read.  Barack was just as open about the stuggles and the issues he pondered.  He genuinely wants to make the best choices and really consider the impacts of decisions.    He has my vote.
B00009W0U4|5.0|..how this movie gets to your mind then to your heart. First shock and confussion, perpetrated by images so brilliantly real and painfully brutal, followed by an intriguing -but not that uncommon- plot that slowly unfolds the real story of Irreversible: one about LOVE AND CHOICES. That's what this movie is about, how sometimes we are just blind enough to not see the danger or what we are truly putting in risk in every decision we make, even when it is in front of our eyes. Or in the worst case, when we willingly sacrifice our good inner self for other temporary pleasures that ultimately lead us to a nightmare.<br />So, putting aside the violence and revenge secuences (that just enhance the whole storytelling) you'll get an actual love story.<br />In short..it's just a wonderful film about LIFE itself just like it is, inmensely beautiful and cruel.
B00005K3O4|5.0|A rare occurrence, when a film this silly turns out to be so great! 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space' is a wonderful homage to the Sci-Fi and monster movies of the 50's. While watching this ultra campy \\"Cult Classic\\" you can't help, but think of 'The Blob' film from 1958. The story pretty much follows the same basic story line except no blob, just really sinister looking space klowns!<br /><br />The clown make-up is fantastic and the sets look like Pee Wee's Playhouse on acid! Clever use of all known Klown props including funny little car, balloon animals, puppets, shadow puppets, popcorn, cotton candy, pie throwing and the big top itself....you name it's in here! Although the Klown make-up is quite creepy, the film is played purely for laughs.<br /><br />It would have been interesting if this film had a couple of really good scares in it! I think they missed a golden opportunity there.....anyone remember 'Night Of The Creeps'? Another campy Horror comedy from the 80's, but that one had some tension and scares in between the laughs. That is why I deduct half a star. The DVD transfer is excellent and this release has a nice amount of extras including commentary, making of, FX, Klown concepts, trailer,deleted scenes and much more!<br /><br /> Thanks \\"C\\" for reminding me to watch this one! Happy Shocktober!
015206396X|4.0|I liked this book- I agree hard to put down once you start. I will not go over the plot, since this has been done by other reviewers. BY the way, I am a Mom who pre-read it before giving it to my child to read.<br />Pros:<br />1.Strong message of girl power. Katsa is brave but not fearless, which I liked. I also enjoyed the format in which we see the story exclusively from her angle and hear her thoughts and emotions.<br />2. Nice beta male hero. Po (hate that name) is cute, supportive and not intimated by a woman/girl who can beat the pulp out of him.<br />3.Good cast of supporting characters.<br />4.The romance was well done. Much more realistic than most straight romance novels.<br />Cons:<br />1. I agree with the comments regarding Katsa's anti-marriage stance which seemed odd to me beacuse there was no background data to support her stance on this.<br />2. Katsa has her first sexual encounter with Po. This is described in vague terms but she makes a clear decision to take him as a lover not husband. I am OK with this but some may more conservative Mom's may disagree. Not really a con.<br />3.During her first sexual encounter, there is a description that she experienced pain with penetration. Again, some Mom's might feel uncomfortable about their younger daughters reading this. Po and Katsa have sex a couple of times. However it is clear their love for each other is deep.Again not really a con.<br />4.Ending is so vague. They seperate and go their own ways, clearly indicating a sequel in the works. I would have preferred it as a stand alone, with sequels set in the same world. Perhaps Skye's story or Raffin's or Bitterblues'.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly to young adults/older teens and of course adults. My personal opinion is that the above issues would make it less appropriate for Middle Schoolers. Again, this is my humble opinion. Others will probably feel differently.
B000W796OM|3.0|While Azkaban is one of my favorite HP books, the movie is not. Once again, the script writer kept essential character scenes out of this movie- it's been like this with ALL the movies! And just like with all the other movies, Snape's character gets his lines widdled down to a toothpick. Azkaban really lost a lot of suspensful elements toward the end, too, not to mention some dark humor. For ex, Snape just \\"shows up\\" in the Shack bedroom, but how? It wouldn't have hurt the writer/director to show maybe 1 minutes' worth of Snape discovering the cloak, map, etc. I gave this a rating of 3 instead of a 1 for it's cinemetography. And that's being generous.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|This CD had 3 of my favorite songs on it, so, it was a winner even before I opened it (they are: Ticks, I'm Still a Guy, Online).  I admire his versitility, with fun songs, ballads, love songs and message songs.  Not to mention his guitar playing skills.      Brad is the Man!!!!
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|\\"Hit\\" is a double-CD collection of Peter Gabriel's greatest hits, one disc labelled \\"Hit,\\"  and one labelled \\"Miss.\\" The great Mr. Gabriel is the former lead singer of Genesis and one of pop/rock's greatest talents because of his clever and inventive lyrics, and notable visual style on videos and in concert. Moreover, his selfless devotion to popularizing world music has made him a champion of otherwise unknown Third World musicians.<br /><br />\\"Hit\\" captures early Gabriel (\\"Solsbury Hill\\" \\"Shock The Monkey\\"), middle Gabriel  (\\"Sledgehammer\\" \\"Steam\\") and later Gabriel (\\"I Grieve\\" \\"The Drop\\") and many other songs that capture the flavor and essence of Gabriel's soulful, eclectic style. But as good as this collection is, it's not comprehensive. Missing is \\"I Have The Touch\\" and \\"Mercy Street,\\" and other fans would think of other songs that should have been included.<br /><br />But this much Gabriel is always a great thing, and \\"Hit\\" is worth having for that reason alone.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I bought this for my two little girls, who love the movie, but I find myself watching it every time it's on.  I especially love the musical numbers in it, and I'm just amazed that this wasn't done on a computer!  It's incredible, the amount of hard work that went in to this and it's quite impressive.  I highly recommend it for all ages, and there's nothing scary about it for the kids.  At least not my 5 and 6 year old!
B000002LGA|5.0|I make no bones about it.   For a long time when I listened to Lou Reed, I just never got it.   For some reason, I always had Reed pigeon-holded as a one hit wonder artist (i.e. \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\") with a cult following.   Let's also face it, when it comes to vocals, Reed isn't going to be mistaken as an all-time legendary vocalist.   Then something changed - I heard Reed's \\"Dirty Blvd\\" from his 1989 album, \\"New York\\".   This song just got me.  I don't know if it was whether it was the guitar work, the sociological lyrics that told the story of a boy named Pedro living in a world of poverty or abuse, or simply Reed's narrative-style vocals.   Whatever it was, this song had me hooked and for the first time, I began to reconsider what Reed as an artist.  Usually when a song gets me, I immediately seek the album.   When I put \\"New York\\" in for a listen, I discovered something even more - a conceptual album.  I typically love conceptual albums with a theme and in this case, Reed sings about many songs about New York City and the issues that affect the people in New York.  I also saw an album that was not your standard \\"cookie cutter\\" 1980s pop synth.   This is an album that clearly was an innovative album with a variety of music styles and deep lyrics to go along with it.    One thing that I like about this album is that Reed encourages you to listen to the album as a whole.  In the liner notes, Reed makes a comment, \\"It's meant to be listened to in one 58 minute (14 songs) sitting as though it were a book or a movie.   Many artists construct albums like this, but I haven't seen an artist recommend this to the listener.   I've put a synopsis of each of the songs below to give some recommendations or pointers of things to look for from a musical perspective.   Conceptually the picture of society painted by Reed is not a positive one.     \\"Romeo Had Juliette\\":  While the chorus may indicate this is a song of two lovers living in New York named Romeo and Juliette, this song is loaded with sociological references to New York City.  Listen to Reed's references to the crack dealers, a cop getting shot in Harlem, and the polluted Hudson River - he definitely paints a grim picture in the pre-Rudy Giuliani New York City.   The guitar work is simply outstanding.    \\"Halloween Parade\\": This is one of several songs on this album with a country-western sound.  However, once again the references are right back on New York.   Lots of references to streets in New York such as Christopher Street, Avenue B, and Avenue D.    Under the title it says AIDS, and Reed also references several times \\"to be here without you\\".   Reed's narrative style vocals are outstanding.    \\"Dirty Blvd\\":  As mentioned, this song tells the story of a boy named Pedro living in a world of poverty and abuse.  Reed uses the narrative style vocals to almost make the story sound three-dimensional.  Reed once again makes references to landmarks in New York City such as 39th Street and the Lincoln Tunnel.  Look for some great background vocals from Dion Di Mucci toward the end of this track.    \\"Endless Cycle\\": Another country-western sounding track.  While this song isn't loaded with New York references, Reed hits the themes of alcoholism and drug use on this song.  Once again using the narrative vocals makes this story three-dimensional.    \\"There is No Time\\": This is the strongest track on the collection.  Reed switches gears an opts for a high energy guitar jam with terrific percussion.  This song is more political as Reed says this is no time to rest on your laurels.  In particular the last line of the song, \\"This is a time for action, because the future is within reach\\".       \\"Last Great American Whale\\":  Reed uses his narrative style to discuss the plights of the environment and of the Native Americans.      \\"Beginning of a Great Adventure\\": This is a more personal song as Lou discusses the Great American Dream and in particular dreams of having a family.  The references to Lou's name and his wife give this a personal touch.  Perhaps the best part is the blues sound to the song.    \\"Busload of Faith\\": Another blues sounding song.  Reed sings about not being dependent on others.  While Reed sings about having faith, he also does criticize religious establishment on this track.    \\"Sick of You\\": This song might be the most country-western sounding on the collection.   Reed references \\"Staten Island\\" as a part of New York, but also references social figures of the time such as Oliver North, Morton Downey, the Ayotollah, and the Trumps.  Pretty much the title of the song is how Reed feels about a lot of them.    \\"Hold On\\": Very much a New York themed song.   The turmoil of Howard Beach in 1986 and Bernard Goetz are all referenced in this song.   Mike Tyson, who grew up in New York is referenced here.       \\"Good Evening Mr Waldheim\\": This might be the most political song on the album.  Reed criticizes the Pope (some might take offense), Kurt Waldheim, and most notably Jesse Jackson (lots of references to his \\"Common Ground\\").       \\"Xmas in February\\":  Reed goes back to the sociological issues and discusses the plight of the Vietnam veterans.  Great work as Reed weaves his his narrative style on this song.    \\"Strawman\\":  Great Anthem-ic Rock sounding song.   Filled with lots of socio-political commentary.   The hard rock sound is great.    \\"Dime Store Mystery\\": This is tribute the Andy Warhol - whom Reed had an association with.  However, the analogy to the crucifixion might be too much for many people.    Overall, this is a powerful album.   It definitely is one of the better albums from the 1980s and not your cookie-cutter music.  Highly recommended.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Being a huge Star Trek fan since I was old enough to sit up in front of the TV watching TOS reruns, I was blown away by the remastered quality of this DVD set.  I'm sure anyone who has a favorite episode can attest to that.  Two standouts for me are \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\" and \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" (Season 2).  Both of these are captivating in their original broadcast form, but the remastered (read: new) SFX shots of the Enterprise struggling to attain orbit with an Air Force jet in pursuit, and the multiple angled shots of the Enterprise and Constellation, having been attacked by the Doomsday Machine, are of such quality, I felt like I was watching a preview of the upcoming \\"Star Trek\\" film.  The Enterprise, while not becoming a victim of \\"big screen surface detailing,\\" now has a believeable mass and weight as she cruises thru space, and the various \\"beauty pass\\" shots in space as well as in orbit had me jumping up and down like I was at a Pistons game!  The sound quality now lets one feel the danger when the ship lurches violently to and fro, throwing people all about the bridge.  Even quiet moments give new perspective on the characters and guest stars' roles.  I feel that the more adventure-driven episodes pack the most punch, though!  I can't wait for Season 3 to see how the treatment has been applied to those great episodes, especially \\"Turnabout Intruder.\\"
B00192KCQ0|5.0|The best heavy metal/hard rock album in years.  For those of you dissapointed with St Anger, I can't imagine this album is going to be a let down. People are making waaay too big of a deal out that \\"clipping\\" issue than it really is.  Its only a bit of an issue if you plan on cranking it up on a crappy stereo system.  1 and 2 star reviews just because of that???  Just buy the album, you wont be dissapointed.
0316067601|4.0|Bought this book going on hols for a quick read, somewhat drawn by the No 1 New York Times Bestseller Tag. Little bit sceptical initially about further US special forces heroics and admittedly knowing very little about US Navy SEAL's. However the book does not disappoint - it keeps you hooked all the way. It's hard not to feel huge admiration for these guys at the end, their steely determination and willingness to pay the ultimate sacrifice for their comrades or their country. Thought the part in the middle where the team deliberated whether or not to execute the goatherds left me with a bit of an uneasy feeling but I suppose it goes to illustrate the fine line between the life and death decisions associated with some of these missions. Book is engrossing at the tactical level and does not stray into any operational or strategic analysis. Would highly recommend this gripping page turner - it won't disappoint.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|The thing that makes Iron Man great is that nobody expected to be great. I mean people were skeptical because Robert Downey Jr. hadnt been in a lead role for a decade so it was questioned if he would fare well or not. After seeing this movie , we all can agree that Robert Downey Jr not only was perfect for the role of Tony Starks, he also gave the man personality.<br /><br />Brief spoilers: Tony Starks gets into a near fatal accident in a Middle Eastern country and is forced to build a weapon for some millitia group there. He builds his first Iron Man suit(which looks like the Iron Giant) and escapes from the terrorist group's clutches. He is found lying in the desert and returns home to say that he is through making weapons comes as a shock to everybody. Meanwhile there is something fishy going on with his longtime partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />Opinion: Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Starks. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his assistant Pepper Potts and even though I had Michael Jai White in mind as Rhodes, Terrence Howard does just fine as the Colonel. Jeff Bridges is in top form as Obadiah Stane. I like how they took time to show how Tony Starks tested his armor out before he decided to finally use it. I also like the fact that the movie sticks to the comic book without being cartoonish and silly. Iron Man was the first superhero movie to come out in 2008 and it unexpectedly set the bar high for superhero movies in 2008. Two thumbs all the way up.
B000FJA1BO|5.0|I finished reading this book today. From the first moment I picked it up at Barnes and Nobles (although I recommend buying it here on Amazon, it's cheaper...), when I just read the first few lines on the cover, I was hooked. Up until this trip to the book store, I have never heard of Chris McCandless, nor did I hear about the famous magic bus in the Alaskan bush. Honestly, my opinion of the book is that it is certainly a very good read. To me, it was fascinating to learn about Chris/Alex's personality, adventures, and sojourns into the west. I thought this book was riveting, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in unconventional traveling, outdoor skills and sports.     That being said I want to say something about Chris himself. First of all, Chris reminds me of Thomas Hardy's Jude. I don't know why. Throughout this entire book I felt more and more saddened. I'm sorry to disagree with the majority of Amazon reviewers here, but Chris was no doubt mentally disturbed. If you think it is in any way normal to go out into the wilderness alone and unprepared and further more, to curtail any personal relationships, think again. I am positive that many psychiatrists would have loved to have Chris on their couch, because he had a rare psyche. Open any psychology 101 book. Human beings are social animals. I have no doubt Chris was mental and I truly feel sorry for him because his demise was unnecessary, had he was brought up normally and was given attention. His parents were always busy (sounds like his dad was especially busy making children) and I blame his parents for not taking the time to seriously check up on him when he showed severe signs of being a recluse.     I know he had problems with his parents, so ok, but he did show love for his sister. I don't understand what kind of a person who says he has in a great relationship with his sister, ends up sending postcards, wishing all the best, not to her, but to a couple of strangers he met on some hellhole corners of the earth?!?!?!? To me, that seems exceptionally crazy, not to mention cruel. This does not add up. Chris's life does not logically add up. I'm sorry Chris, you really were either incompetent or suicidal, neither of which is a good thing.     BTW - Am I the only one who finds it ironic the Chris donated all his money for an organization to end hunger, when at the end, it was hunger that that killed him?
B00192KCQ0|1.0|This album is very bad. It's a combination of every style Metallica has played.....I have to say that St. Anger is way better than this album...and St. Anger sucks!.
B0019X3YXM|4.0|Would you be attracted to a seemingly bi-polar, erratic and extremely domineering young woman (Jordan) you met on a subway just as she was passing out in a drunken stupor? Well you might if she looked like Elisha Cuthbert. That's just what happened for conservative and highly motivated Charlie (Jesse Bradford) and from that moment on he would forever divide his life between the time before he met her and the time after.<br /><br />The '07 American remake of the Korean film of the same name, `My Sassy Girl' is an entertaining though inebriated love story that I like to refer to as `Serendipity' with alcohol.  For the majority of the film the viewer will most likely find themselves in a state of confusion, yet fully intrigued and engaged in to film. You will wonder more than once exactly where the storyline is heading, so much so that the fate of the film depended on a really good ending to weave all the disparate, unanswered aspects of the tale into an acceptable conclusion. Fortunately, the ending does exactly that providing the audience with not only understanding but a bit of unexpected depth. Well worth the time and effort I would say.
1573229725|5.0|I LOVED this book. My heart was pounding during several narrative moments in the novel. There are lots of plot twists and turns, and the reader will never see them coming. I lost many hours of sleep reading this book because I just couldn't put it down.
B001CLG6RC|2.0|Several listens and it's clear that this release is the weakest work of the Enigma catalog.  While there are good elements scattered throughout the album (the vocal on 'La Puerta Del Cielo' is a highlight), the obtrusive, heavy handed \\"hip-hop\\" beats are overbearing and just don't fit.  Creating a mellow mood is what Enigma has always been about, but this album makes me feel anything but mellow.
B00011CZRE|4.0|Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make Seven a must see. There are enough twists and turns to make the story go. Sometimes more obvious than it  needs to be, it still has great acting, solid story line, believeable characters and action.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is incredible. There are a few downsides, however the results make it worth the 5 stars.     1. I have completed the DVD and haven't lost 20 pounds, however I have lost so many inches all over my body that everyone asks me what I've been doing.  2. You can't skip the intro I suggest starting the DVD and then changing into your workout clothes. It's ready to go when you come back down.    All in all a great workout that will get you in shape in 20 minutes a day.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I saw Skynyrd in 1974 when Sweet Home Alabama was released and didn't know much about them then. I saw the 2x more and they just got better every time. This new release of One more From the Road is probably the best live album ever! I know that's saying a lot but just close your eyes and you are front row center at the Fox Theater. This should be in everyones CD collection!
B001GAPC1K|1.0|Literally one of the worst Movies I have seen. Glad Robert is sober.  He was a better actor when he was on drugs. Two thumbs way down.    The popularity of this movie shows how boring America really is.    You all suck for making this the top grossing movie of all time.    IT SUCKS IT IS A BAD MOVIE ROBERT START TAKING DRUGS AGAIN YOU NEED IT!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Got just what I wanted for cheeper than in stores. Product shipped exactly as described.
0375826726|4.0|I have read the first 2 books and I liked them so I read the third,I was dissapointed when I found out that Brisingr was not indeed the last book in the trilogy.It is a good book with some minor glitches in it.              First of all,the way eragon sentenced Sloan to a one way trip to elesmera had something wrong with it although I dont quite know what.I was thinking before Brisingr came out that it would be a book that would be mostly war seeing as the way eldest had left us off and I was suprised when I read it and found out that it was really just a bunch of minor battles.     When  eragon goes to elesmera again and finds out that morzan is not his real father but that Brom is his real father I find it a little suspicious that in the first book when Brom died and eragon made his grave he wrote on it HERE LIES BROM HE WAS A DRAGON RIDER AND LIKE A FATHER TO ME:I came to the conclusion that either CP thought back to the time when this happened and decided it would be good for it to come true, or he had in mind when he wrote it  in the first book that in the third book eragon would find out,of the 2 the first is far more likely.                    When the fourth actually does come out it will be more of a continuation then all the other books.The first book ends off that eragon will go to the elves, the second book ends off that eragon will go with Roran to Heligrind, this book ends off in midlle of a war finished the war should have continued. I cant wait for the 4th book to come out:
B000UX6THK|5.0|I can't believe they ever aired this show. It was so ahead of its time, and it still seems that way because there hasn't been a show like it since. If you like David Lynch, you cannot go another day without buying this collection, but make sure you get some cherry pie and coffee before you sit down!
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|Time-traveling, teleporting. I've been always kind of a sucker for these sci-fi premises. What would you do if you could teleport yourself to basically any place on the face of the earth? Steven Gould, in his novel Jumper, uses this premise and gives his characters the innate ability to instantly teleport themselves. It is definitely an interesting foundation, however, Director Doug Liman and screenwriters David S. Goyer, Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg do little to exploit this promising idea, and come up with a movie that takes us through NYC, Rome, Egypt, Tokyo, but ends up going absolutely nowhere.    Hayden Christensen is David Rice, a normal teenager until he finds he's got the ability to teleport himself from place to place when he first \\"jumps\\" spontaneously in order to escape his abusive father (Michael Rooker). Having run away, he learns to control his ability and then does, I guess, what every one of us, being a teleporting teenager, would do: go into a bank's vault and get away with several thousands in cash. The good thing is that Jumpers do not have to worry about mingling their own molecules with a fly's, as they can actually hold onto anything: other people, cars, even parts of a building, and teleport to another place arriving safe and sound on the other side with whoever or whatever they were carrying.    David grows up and, by that time, he's already got a penthouse at a luxurious NY building and he's been all over the world. The usual day for him involves having breakfast on top of the Giza's Sphinx in Egypt, spending the afternoon surfing the best waves of the season in Hawaii or Fiji, and having a drink at a popular pub in London while checking out and hitting on the hot babes at night.    Yes, life is good for David, that is, until the bad guys appear. He learns that he is not the only one with that unusual gift and also learns that there is actually a group of people that hunt Jumpers for a living. Roland, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has been following David since he first broke in at his first bank. He is the leader of the Paladins, that particular group of individuals whose only goal in life seems to be killing all the Jumpers and, apparently, this war between Jumpers and Paladins has been going on for hundreds if not thousands of years.     But David doesn't look like he is the type of guy that'd enjoy messing up with other people's lives. Granted, he steals money, but then he is basically a good guy that likes to pamper himself and enjoy a low-profile, big-shot-like life and spend big amounts of money. I'd bet the IRS would nail him before The Paladins would. Ok yes, I guess with time David could get bored of all the indulgences and turn to the bad side; maybe teleport himself right into the Pentagon secret archives and steal some sensitive material and then try to sell it or just give it away to a terrorist organization. I haven't read the book, but I understand that, in the original Gould's novel, there is no Paladin organization and the villains (or at least the guys chasing David), are actually NSA agents who are trying to understand these powers and get them to \\"good\\" use. I think Roland says that he works for the NSA, which initially made sense to me, but then, this character turns out to be just an obsessed, fanatical hunter. This is where the movie starts going nowhere. We spend the rest of the time watching Roland following and fighting David, while he drags with him his love interest, Millie (Rachel Blison), around the world. Throw in the appearance of Griffin (Jamie Bell), another paranoid Jumper, and the brief and inexplicable appearance of David's mother (Diane Lane), who's a Paladin herself (!?), and we end up with this 88 minute mess.      There are so many inconsistencies in this movie that it is hard to follow. For instance, I really never bought or understood Roland. What's his motivation? Nobody knows. The movie doesn't stop to elaborate on this issue. Maybe he's jealous because he can't teleport himself, but, in any case, he seems to be pretty much settled as he can travel all over the world and it is obvious that he doesn't depend on commercial airlines schedules.    Roland utters at some point something like: \\"God is the only one that should have those powers!\\", and if you consider that the name Paladins has been associated with the highest officials of the Catholic Church, the religious connotation is inevitable. I assume that most religious people don't question what their religion says, they just comply. Liman and company are like that, they don't care. They don't give the Paladins a cause, they just let them hate the Jumpers so much, and then they give us Roland, an overzealous, inquisitorial-like priest whose religion states that its worst deadly sin is teleporting.    Roland is blind for mysterious reasons, but I'm not. If David's mother is a Paladin and she won't kill her own son, why not convince her to enlist David as a Paladin? Paladins can not \\"jump\\", so it might be helpful for them to have an actual jumper in the ranks. Why not convince David to partner with him and do something good for the entire human race, or just themselves? Can you imagine the possibilities? This is what saves this movie from the worst rating. I've spent myself quite some time thinking about these, and when movies make me think, I like them. Forget about having David teleporting medical supplies to a disaster stricken, inaccessible region, or having David rescue a bunch of people from the top of a burning building. How about being the world's most feared paparazzo? Jump into a celebrity's home, catch him or her off guard, and get away with some photos that could be sold to the tabloids for millions, or how about just establishing the world's fastest and most effective courier service? Anyway, if I ever come across a Jumper, watch out FedEx!
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|We love this CD. We wish, however, that the music would have been ordered as they were presented in the movie.
031606792X|3.0|I liked this book mainly because... it had a happy ending.  The rest were all...blah.  Spoilers!  My main problems with this book is that during the whole book, Edward and Bella have hardly any 'feelings'. Meyer TELLS you they do this, the look at eachother like that, etc. but you dont feel it. It's not like the first three books, when you can actually feel Edward's pain, and Bella's love. This book just says that Edward is in pain, that Bella's in love, that Jacob's angry.  My other major problem is the whole Volturi situation. They don't fight! Why? I wanted bloodshed, resolution, revenge, anything from Meyer. I wanted to know that in the future, the Volturi won't come after the Cullens again. I understand if they still exist (because who could keep order of the other vampires?) but I wanted something to be done.   I still fairly liked this book, but it wasnt the best one.    P.S, You can find the Twilight Saga in paperback at airports (e.g. Hong Kong International Airport), inculding Breaking Dawn. They're a lot cheaper too.
1400097029|4.0|Banville's novels that I have read are all about alcoholic old men full of self-hatred.  The Sea is another item in this genre.      The narrator in The Sea, Max, is a half-hearted art historian whose wife has recently died of cancer.  The most intensely and empathetically described events in this novel are of Max's and Anna's cancer episodes.  Anna's disease and lingering death are not easy, and are touchingly described in bits and pieces of Max's recollection.  Anyone who has been through the \\"cancer-wringer\\" with a loved one will find themselves weeping again.       After the death of Anna, Max has returned to a beach resort where he spent his youthful summers.  This return Max recognizes as a self-imprisonment.  He reminisces in absurd detail about his attempts there to frolic with the Grace family when he was eleven or twelve years old.  Ultimately disaster strikes the troubled and bizarre Grace family, but how this affects Max is difficult to fathom--both for him and the reader.  There is little plot or story to this short novel, but there are vastly many overcooked ruminations about multitudinous subjects--none of which seem to add up to much, or to be particularly interesting; just like Max's life.     Actually, self-loathing, or self-hatred seem too heroic to describe Max's tepid contempt for himself.  He can't even manage a decent self-destructive moment.  Max is a weak, helpless, failed individual whose only entertainment is to dwell on minutiae of the past. And why is Max writing this memoir anyway?  The reader never learns.  In any case, as self-described, Max is a failed art historian who has been living on Anna's inherited wealth.  Evidently Max has accomplished nothing of value.  Love and connection to other people, even his daughter, seem to elude him.       I wonder what the florid and difficult writing that is typical of Banville mean and how it is connected to Max's self-contempt.  What kind of man writes using many words that he is sure his readers will not know or be able to define?  Does he expect the reader to turn to the dictionary and look up these bizarre words?  Does he expect the reader to feel inferior?  On the contrary I get the sense that the narrator, or maybe it is Banville himself, feels deeply inferior and using big, obscure words and la-de-da literary allusions is a way of hiding from himself if only thinly his own inability to live.      The only thing powerful and real for Max are his grief over the death of Anna and his solipsistic recollections of his summer with the Graces.  These are also powerfully evoked for the reader, and thus this novel is a wringer for the reader.  But do we always want the easy and pleasant?  How are we to confront our own demons if we always flee them in mere entertainment?
B00125WAWS|5.0|Great cast, even the student actors, but Washington and Whitaker bookend the whole movie.  Strong and challenging script with several emotionally charged scenes.  Mixes history, logic, rascism, workers rights, and drama with convincing authority.  Excellent.
B0018M6J90|2.0|Not a bad film, and it contains a good deal of enjoyable performances from all the cast. Yet, in the end, both my wife and I felt there was not quite enough there to make it stand out. Bet you Leonard Maltin gives it 2.5 stars, and I would too, but Amazon doesn't let you give half points!
006029129X|5.0|I used to love reading this book to the kids, before the baby became a toddler (see below).<br /><br />The drawings are clear.  That little Harold is so darling -- all head and crayon and cuteness.  The stories take Harold on adventures that always end safely at home in bed.<br /><br />They are a fun way to imagine... what comes next?  When we make up family stories, sometimes we try to find new directions to take a story, especially when one gets sidetracked (by silliness, grossness, etc. -- I have boys).  These Harold stories do exactly the same thing:  when Harold gets stuck, or nervous, or in danger, he just imagines his way out of it.<br /><br />The books are very clever.  The illustrations are basically line drawings, but they convey the story perfectly.  I like this collection because it has 4 Harold stories together.<br /><br />Anyway, my youngest went through a book-ripping phase about a year ago, so we put up all the books with pages and kept the board books down at his level.  Somehow, Harold got misplaced.  We got it out again this week, and to my joy, yesterday the 6-year old was reading it to the 3-year-old.  They were laughing and giggling about the book, and I fell in love with the story all over again.<br /><br />Awesome book.<br /><br />***updated*** this book includes four stories:<br /><br />Harold and the Purple Crayon<br />Harold's Fairy Tale<br />Harold's Trip to the Sky<br />Harold's Circus
B000VDDDY6|3.0|I've seen some of the new CGI effects, and some are very nice. Others, flat and artificial. In that sense, they aren't any more \\"real\\" than the original grainy footage done with mattes and models.     But even if the new effects were state of the art, they are married to an old series where the sets are obviously plywood and cheap paint. The heavy makeup is not subtle either. Some of the medical instruments are literally oddly-shaped salt shakers. The rocks on the planet surfaces are a plastic or styrofoam-type material. This show was not meant for high definition. It was meant for standard definition analog television transmission. If you like seeing all the flaws, fine. That's not my bag, and maybe not yours either.     For me, the remastering is an exercise in futility. The show was what it was -- episodic S-F done quickly on a relatively modest budget. I loved the show, and spent a lot of my own time and effort trying to get the show revived back in the 1970s. All of you who enjoyed The Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and the motion pictures can thank me and those like me -- who convinced Paramount that there was a real market for the continuing franchise.     But I've bought the first DVD sets of The Original Series, and I think they are a better representation of the show. Feel free to buy what you like, but newer is not necessarily better. Higher definition is not necessarily better. Why is it better to see all the pores on Captain Kirk's nose? To me, that's a distraction. The script's the thing. The acting is the thing. The anachronistic sets and costumes and grainy shots of spacecraft models... well, you're going to have to suspend your disbelief. Shakespeare had the worst special effects and sets imaginable back in his Globe Theater days. Imagination beats CGI any day of the week. Ultimately, the CGI does not look \\"real\\" either. And it clashes with the style of the live-action footage.     I fear that many purchases of these remastered editionswill be knee-jerk responses by fans enticed by something new and different, without regard to whether it is truly an improvement. If you think the new mastering and effects significantly adds to the joy of this classic series, then that is certainly a valid reason to buy. I only want to caution people that they may have the same tepid reaction I have.
B0019T9FL6|1.0|I have waited so long for Jennifer to release her album. I woke up at 5:30am tuesday morning so I could download it before I got ready for work.  Needless to say I should have stayed in my bed for another half hour.  I tried to give it a chance a listen to it over and over.  I am still not feeling it.  I also agree the song with T-pain and ludacris are horrible. I also agree that I was expecting a classic first debut like Whitney Houston's.  I truly wish I-tunes would do refunds.  Go by Jazzmine Sullivan's album.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|and surprisingly, the live crowd didn't ruin the entire recording as typically happens. I think everyone was so amazed to even see them. This set is definitely worth the purchase. You can feel the energy in the music and it sounds like everyone there had a good time. I'm kinda jealous.
0156034026|5.0|I was hooked at the first page. I love the narrator's style: you are the listener and can just imagine sitting opposite Changez in Lahore's Old Anarkali: definitely those who have been, and I hope also those who have not. Since, I believe, this book gives a wonderfully nuanced insight into the beautiful hospitable country Pakistan is and how external events and categorisations trigger in people emotions that are often misunderstood and which trigger further events into a vicious circle.    It is not a pessimistic book, but a personal recount which could lead to breaking the vicious circle of mistrust by bringing better understanding through a beautiful piece of prosa!
0743455967|5.0|This book is a combination of autobiography and instructions on writing. Mr. King selects incidents from his youth that led him to become a writer, and illuminates us on his progress. Should be a delightful book for anyone who wishes to become a popular writer, and appreciates this man's books. I find it helpful and fun to read.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|I really had my mind set on this debut from her, I've loved her since American Idol and saw both of the movies she was in: Sex & The City & DreamGirls. She can sing and she can act, so when i got wind of a definite release date on her debut, I was soooo excited. I got over the fact that they wasted a track on rehashing the song from Dreamgirls. If they really wanted to blow me away, they should've made it a duet with her and Jennifer Holliday, no holds barred singing either.  Spotlight grew on me and I ended up singing it around the house when there was no music playing at all. I got over the album cover and I got over her fake forced laugh at 106 and that sudden engagement to a reality tv star (not her boyfriend since high school). This girl has chops but when it came to the album, the material wasn't as strong. It reminded of not only the \\"too-much hype\\" theory but also it sounded like a record by an artist who didn't have good material to work with which seems to be more the cause of first class divas that have been around a long time (Patti Labelle, albums in the 90's). Pocketbook is a really good jam but came off like a \\"we've got to put a hood jam on here\\". Some of the songs came off to Idol-y to me, She could've did better without T-Pain instead getting a more capable male duet singer like Babyface, Jahiem or Raheem Devaughn who can rift and melisma like no other male singer. The whole vocal machine thing is tired; Only Zapp can pull that off and do it well, and maybe Teddy Riley. She did really good on \\"Jesus Has A Home For Me Over There\\" but she didnt blow me away. She was pretty underwhelming on the Diane Warren song. However, the song she did with Fantasia is on point; That was one of few highlights on the album and I think if she did an entire album around that sound of old school r&b, she would have gotten a solid 5. It had that \\"Woman 2 Woman\\" feel to it and Fantasia is the only other female artist that can hold her own against Jennifer. It still givesme chills. It's too many misses for me and it didn't smesh well. I really tried one night to play this through and through and like it really hard, but I wasn't really impressed.

B001AKTZOG|5.0|PENDULUM was Creedence Clearwater Revival's last great album. Among the wonderful songs here are \\"Hey Tonight\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\\" As a person who listens to classic rock bands such as the Eagles, the Allman Brothers Band, Jackson Browne, the Outlaws, Deep Purple, Steve Miller, Fleetwood Mac, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Santana, Bruce Springsteen, Heart, Ted Nugent, REM, Blue Oyster Cult, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Foghat, Tom Petty, and Bob Seger, I feel That Creedence fits in with all of those great bands in their own way. This album is a must-own for any classic rock fan.
0307269752|5.0|Very suspenseful, taut mystery with well rendered characters.  The character driven plot sucks you in and keeps you guessing what's next. Kudos to the translator for a translation from the swedish that was not awkward.  I liked this book a lot for the story and characters and was shocked that the author died in 2004.
B001AW9DKK|1.0|As a fan of C/S/N/Y, I own dozens of albums by the four guys in various combinations and solo.  Again in different combinations, I've seen them in concert several times and enjoyed the shows each time.  But this Deja Vu Live CD is excrutiatingly bad.  It's a bad recording, something like a third-rate soundboard mix.  Their harmonies, once a trademark and a major reason I've liked their music, are at different volume levels so they don't sound balanced.  (Ex., on the sadly poor version of \\"Find the Cost of Freedom,\\" C is at about volume 4 out of 10, N is at a 6, S is a 3, and Y is a 7.  So the harmonies aren't right at all.)  The vocals, guitars, etc. are often very sloppy, I think possibly from boredom at having to play these songs for the five thousandth time or whatever.  Stills has a terribly muttered and slurred way of singing \\"For What It's Worth\\" that made me cringe.  And on and on.  There are just too many problems with this CD for me to list them all!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|After a wait of over *gasp* 15 years, Metallica have finally released another album that fans can be proud to crank up in their cars.    After straying since releasing the Black Album, Metallica have once again found their way.  With long songs, long solos and even an instrumental, this is Metallica back in form.
1582701709|1.0|Amazon.com    You are just gotten too big.  Your customer service department is useless.      I never received my book.  I have made several attempts to start a search to track it down but your system is just too big to care for a small person like me.  I will never buy a book or anything from you in my life.  I am glad that it only cost me 20 dollars to figure this out.    Walter
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I've stuck with Metallica regardless of what many have said and love the new \\"Death Magnetic\\"...I didn't stop liking them after \\"Justice\\" and have liked thier different sounds.The songs are electrifying and rock hard.You can't please everyone,especially critical 'Tallica fans.But I feel that all or a few of those bashers will enjoy this album.If you are like me and have stuck with Metallica through \\"The Black Album\\",\\"Load\\" ,\\"Re-Load\\",etc..what are you waiting for??? Go get this one now.It will rock you hard!!It is strong from beginning to end!!!!
0765356139|5.0|One of the main things I dislike about fiction is that it is fiction! In the sense that authors tend to shy away from the grim reality of life and tend to find easy solutions to problems in their works of imagination. Not so with Brandon Sanderson who is one of the few authors I have ever read to have both his feet on the ground and totally aware of the reality of the world around him. Happy will eventually turn not-so-happy. That which we consider as failure and misforture might provide beneficial assistance somewhere later in life. People are neither wholly good nor wholly bad - most are somewhere in the middle, their goodness or badness surfacing dependent on the circumstance and situation - and their own inevitable human weaknesses.    Not to ramble too much about the relativity of the world we live in - yes Sanderson is fully aware of these paradoxes and it is well reflected in his books. So the stories are much more complex, evolved and truer to life (though they be fantasy) than most works of fiction - but still very accessible.    Elantris was not too bad. The final kingdom was much better. And the Wells ... is even better. Great storytelling. Sanderson does a twist on the prophecy-hero formula which is quite in line with his realistc worldview.    I can't wait to get my hands on \\"Hero of the ages\\" now!

1604244674|5.0|This novel is about a very good-looking guy named Dorian. And like many extremely handsome guys (you know who you are ;), he thinks he can get away with anything!<br /><br />This is full of wit and clever one-liners. Written by Oscar Wilde in the late 1800's, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is as true today as ever.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Good movie, kind of long though and more drama than action.  Maggie is very good in this movie.  I'd recommend it only for adults though, pretty provocative.

6303614493|3.0|Casper  Many people have asked me when I was going to kick off the Halloween Season recently, and now I have. Casper is a child-friendly ghost story that is based off an old cartoon series. Considering this film was made in 1995, Casper has held up very well. If you are looking for a fun movie for your children to watch, you might want to check out Casper. If you are an adult, avoid this at all costs.    The story is very light hearted. Carrigan, a greedy woman, has just inherited a haunted Manor. There are three threatening ghosts: Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso. There is also a friendly ghost, Casper. Carrigan knows of a treasure somewhere in the manor, but needs to get the ghosts out of way to get to it. After many other choices, she settles with Dr. Harvey. Harvey and his daughter, Kat, move into the home in hopes to drive the ghosts out.    The CG used for the ghosts is phenomenal. Even in today's world, this CG stands up well to the rest. You can see through the ghosts, but at the same time they have a thickness to them. You will never complain about having a dated movie.    The relationship between Kat and Casper is the most interesting part in this movie. As an adult, the corny story telling will not keep the amused for long. Kat and Casper have a couple deep altercations. Casper asks Kat \\"Can I keep you,\\" and Kat agrees. However, Casper tries to kiss Kat, but Kat only feels a chill. It is tragic.    If you are an adult Casper is worthless. If you are looking for a fun Halloween flick for your children, this is for you. There are a few derogatory words, but nothing a mature child cannot handle. Then again, Casper usually comes on television each Halloween. You might want to avoid this one on that note.
0684830485|5.0|This tackles several questions: How war shapes men, past and present and what a real hero is.<br /><br />Set in the Spanish Civil War, the story revolves around the experiences of a volunteer fighter, an American college professor named Robert Jordan. Filled with idealism at first, watch him reconsider as he faces the prospect of his own death.<br /><br />One of Hemingway's finest.

0439023483|5.0|Based on the review by Steven King and the recommendation by Stephenie Meyer, I bought the book. I could not put it down even though I cried most of the way through it. God help us if we ever allow out world to turn into the one Collins created for this book. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B000002HMH|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it up front: this does not sound like the Metallica we were used to. That said, the album is very good.<br /><br />Metallica experiments a little on \\"Load,\\" trying out some new styles. This is most noticeable on \\"Mama Said,\\" which almost sounds country. As a whole, the album has a slower pace than any other Metallica album, but makes up for it with depth: \\"Hero of the Day,\\" \\"Until it Sleeps\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" sound totally different from what we're used to but strike us still, relying more on lyrics and metaphor than, say, \\"One\\" or \\"Master of Puppets,\\" which are still amazing pieces of music but use different tactics to get there.<br /><br />Comparing it to other Metallica works is where the argument begins. Standing alone, this is a great album.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Absolutely brilliant soundtrack which is dark, menacing and brooding, perfectly complimenting the excellent Dark Knight. I must confess I paid little attention to the soundtrack while watching the movie at the cinema (3 times), but I am delighted that from the first track it conjures powerful images from the movie and so perfectly describes in music the three main characters. As an added bonus it alarmed the kids, so at least they won't be running off with it to play in their room!!! BUY IT NOW! You will not be disappointed.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I thought Daniel Day Lewis was outstanding and evil in this movie, but I thought he was the only thing good in the movie.  It has a good story about an oil man, but it is very long and it gets boring.
B000002HRE|3.0|The Metallica fans are divided, with some saying Metallica has evolved and others saying they betrayed their fans. Make no mistake: \\"Reload\\" sounds nothing like \\"Master of Puppets\\" and bears only a passing resemblance to \\"Load.\\"<br /><br />The album is distinctly heavier than its namesake predecessor, yet tries to maintain its feel by including softer songs like \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" (a good track in its own right, but I digress). What this amounts to is a bunch of songs, some of which are great and some immediately forgettable, all tossed into a blender and put on the album in whatever order they came out. The album doesn't flow well, a cardinal sin when coming from the same people who brought us \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning.\\"<br /><br />Most of the songs are good, but the album is laid out terribly, leaving us somewhere in limbo when it comes to forming an opinion of it.
B0015FML06|5.0|In it's longest form (official) yet, this video highlights U2 at what some may say was their peak. The rain didn't damper their fire (if anything the smaller crowd, and dreary surroundings make them even more exciting) and this was a showcase for the band and the venue.    I first saw them right around this time on the tour and this was how I became a lifelong U2 fan.     As far as the picture and sound, it is top notch. Much brighter and crisper than the previous Laserdisc / VHS. The sound is a bit better than the old laserdisc, but not as improved as the picture.     The concert is missing just a few things. \\"I Fall Down\\" is not included in the set at all because of (from the liner notes) \\"A camera malfunction\\" and Two Hearts is missing a snippet of \\"Lets Twist Again\\" and Electric Co is missing about 2 minutes of \\"Send in the Clowns\\", cutting out the Edge's on FIRE guitar solo.    All in all, nice to see a more complete, better looking package. While I miss the solo/send in the clowns bit, I would rather gain the additional tracks, much improved picture and lose 2 minutes than go back to the laserdisc.    -Chrisedge    Edited to ADD: Many folks are complaining about the red lines or streaks in the picture. This is the result of using tube cameras to videotape the concert. Before CCD Camera Technology, Tube cameras were used to videotape, and any time they are pointed into a bright light, then moved, it can cause the streaking that you see. This is not a defect of the DVD, nor something that could be easily corrected. It was in the original version as well, but the better clarity is probably showing it off a bit more.
B000P12LWY|3.0|I have now viewed all of the first series, well, there is now doubt the emphasis is on sexual content, rather than historic content.  It may be that the historical content is so well known, that they had to do something to make it interesting!  Why, did they have to make a show of the king masturbating into a towel held by one of his man servants!!!  That aside, the costumes were stunning and the casting was excellent.  If you want to watch a softporn series, great, go for it.  I await the second series with anticipation . . .  Just to see if the producers can come up with something interesting in the story line, if they dare!
B00000FCBC|3.0|I really, really wanted to give this a positive review, but I can't. Individually, the songs on here are fantastic, especially the cover of Bob Seger's \\"Turn the Page\\" and \\"Whiskey in the Jar.\\" As an album though, the band shifts styles dramatically from track to track, making it extremely difficult to listen to straight through. It sounds like I played it on random.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent album. I would have just liked to see it flow a little more smoothly.
B0019T9FL6|1.0|This CD is very disappointing. For all of the hype around Jennifer Hudson, I expected a stellar debut on par with Whitney Houston's classic. Jennifer's CD suffers from mediocre, lazy material and ill-conceived collaborations. The song with T-Pain is beyond terrible, and the \\"Pocketbook\\" song with Ludacris is equally bad. \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" would have been a decent song, but it is such a blatant rip-off of Shirley Brown's soul classic \\"Woman To Woman\\" that I can't even take it seriously. I'm thoroughly disappointed with this CD.
0061537934|5.0|What a great book -- not in the sense of masterful literature but, rather, a satisfying \\"read\\" with a wonderful message. Check out the review by Jesse Kornbluth for a taste of what the book has in store for you that I wouldn't attempt to recreate. I read it 3 weeks ago during our vacation in Maine.  Had occasion to describe it to a new-found friend we just met at dinner one night whom we learned happens to own a Doberman and gave the book to him (I don't want to disclose much about the ending except to say 'paying it forward' is a theme). So, why am I here? I'm buying another for my daughter who is about to get a \\"rescued\\" dog. Enjoy!
B000002H2H|5.0|Talk of Metallica albums usually passes over \\"Ride the Lightning\\"; you hear how great \\"Master of Puppets\\" is, the transition that was \\"the black album\\" and general disgust at \\"St. Anger.\\" The truth is, without \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" we never would have seen any of the others.<br /><br />\\"Ride the Lightning\\" was Metallica's sophomore album, and it represents a quantum leap forward over \\"Kill 'Em All,\\" setting the sound that has come to be known as \\"Metallica\\" to us. The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into \\"Master of Puppets,\\" arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track \\"The Call of Ktulu.\\"<br /><br />Definitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you're just getting into the band.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|\\"John Adams\\" is one of the best , if not the BEST Historical Video Presentation to come down the pike in a long time. The casting, acting, wardrobe and photography were SUPERB!    The only critizism I would give is the lack of DETAIL in some of the scenes and to increase the length of the video another 2 hours.    The packaging of this video is EXCELLENT and has become a HIGHLIGHT of my VIDEO LIBRARY.
B000002H33|5.0|Simply put, this is metal at its finest by arguably the greatest metal band in their heyday.<br /><br />Besides playing host to the ubiquitous \\"Battery\\" and the titular track \\"Master of Puppets,\\" the album contains \\"Sanitarium\\" and \\"The Thing That Should Not Be,\\" two other great tracks. The rest of the album is solid, including the instrumental track \\"Orion.\\"<br /><br />This album is great but not for the faint of heart; you have been warned.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|A holiday perennial along with \\"Miracle on 34th St.\\" and \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", this new release brings a new perspective to a yuletide classic.  As someone who is adamantly opposed to colorization of black & white movies, I've always pondered what this film would look like it in color.  Had it not been wartime, perhaps Holiday Inn might have been made in color; who really knows.<br /><br />Fortunately, the technical methods of colorization have improved 10 fold vs those horrible Ted Turner productions of the 1980's.  The release of [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO It's A Wonderful Life (Two-Disc Collector's Set) (B/W & Color)]] showed that the colorized version was very good.  I found myself watching the color version first, saving the B&W rendering for closer to Christmas Day.  I'm sure this colorized edition of Holiday Inn will be fine as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that digital remastering is NOT the same as a complete digital restoration, and the B&W version does need touching up.  Maybe someday we will be treated to yet another release which has been restored to its original pristine B&W splendor.  Meanwhile, this edition looks worthy for anyone's Christmas collection!<br /><br />UPDATE: 11.04.08<br /><br />Super kudos to Legend Films, Inc. for a magnificent job in bringing color to one of America's perennial holiday classics.  What is most striking are the background details that color brings out.  Most notable, for me, is the Independence Day sequence; the stage curtain for example.  But all of the holidays are delightful making this edition pleasing for purists whom are curious to know what the holiday colors are and those whom just prefer color v B&W.  And everyone blessed with good hearing should watch the movie at least once with the cleverly placed English closed captions.  Just a brilliant job by Legend Films, Inc.
B000002H97|5.0|Before I get into the meat of my review, I must acknowledge that this album was one of several that distanced the \\"hardcore\\" Metallica fans from the band. Many felt betrayed by the band, which they had seen as moving away from their thrasher metal roots. This is indeed true; the album is very radio-friendly. That said, the album on its own is very solid, whatever your opinion of how it compares to the band's previous work.<br /><br />From the distinctive opening noted of \\"Enter Sandman\\" all the way to the end notes of \\"The Struggle Within,\\" there is not a bad song on this album. Several Metallica staples, including \\"The Unforgiven,\\" \\"Sad But True\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" also make appearances on the album.<br /><br />I know the above-mentioned \\"hardcore\\" fans find a positive review of this album a heresy, but for many who have never sampled metal before - myself included - this acts as a gateway album for getting into Metallica. An avid fan myself now, I would have never delved into \\"Ride the Lightning\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\" if I hadn't heard \\"the black album\\" first.
B000063DHL|4.0|While this isn't \\"Number of The Beast\\" or \\"Powerslave\\", this is still a solid, better than average release from Iron Maiden.  This was the first album that Maiden would incorporate guitar synths into their music.  The synths add texture to them and make them more acessible.  I'm not going to use the C word (commercial)because the songs are still very progressive and too long to be considered made for radio.  Adrian Smith wrote alot of the material on here (Wasted Years, Stranger in A Strange Land, Sea of Madness) and it's obvious his song writing is more pop oriented incorporating sing along choruses and hooks galore.  Pretty much after listening to this album it's not hard to see why he would do just one more album with Maiden before leaving the band for about a 10 year hiatus to go out on his own.  His songwriting was heading in a different direction from the stereotypical Maiden style.  Nothing wrong with that because I found his songs to be a nice change of pace.  His solo on \\"Stranger..\\" is easily one of his five best of all time.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I found \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"Alexander the Great\\" a bit subpar.  \\"Alexander\\" doesn't hold up with Maiden's other epic closing tracks like \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" and \\"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\\" although it is better than \\"To Tame A Land\\".  Overall this is a solid album that I feel is a slight bit better than \\"Seventh Son\\" although most people feel that was the album they perfected the guitar synths.
B000002J0P|5.0|When I was 13, my older cousin took my brother and me to an ice cream shoppe in Westport, CT (don't know if it's still there, don't even recall the name). The shoppe had an area that sold candy, merchandise and vinyl records. My cousing bought this album for me. It was my first exposure to rock (being raised on Mantovani, Peter Nero, 101 Strings and Perry Como). The shop was a colorful, magical place, and my cousin took the lp from the shelf and put it in my hands. When I played it at home I was blown away by the harmonies and lush sounds that originated from vinyl records. This is my first rock record, and has always been my favorite.

B001CD6FKI|3.0|I use to watch the \\"Speed Racer\\" cartoon series as a kid and enjoyed it a lot. In turn, I enjoyed \\"Speed Racer\\" the movie with its futuristic special effects, the way it looked like it was a cross between a cartoon come to life and an actual Japanese anime, made this movie visually stunning.     The costuming was perfect and it fell in line with the cartoon series. The acting and cinematography were also perfect. I am happy with the fact that this movie kept true to the characters and how they reacted in a manner that was in line with the cartoon series.     \\"Speed Racer\\", the movie, was a little too kiddie for me on the whole as an adult viewer and a little too long in length. I think 90 minutes would have been better than two hours, fifteen minutes.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion has an amazing voice.  Every song on this CD can touch the heart and soul.  There are several cuts on the CD that I just love.  They are love songs that you can relate to, as far as loving your man.  Celine Dion is truly gifted with a beautiful voice and songs that can move mountains.  I am a fan of her music.  I bought several of her CD's and would highly recommend them to any person that like love songs.    Mildred Peebles
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I loved watching this HBO Series immensely and was sad to see it go off the air! So, when \\"Sex & The City\\", the movie came out, it felt like catching up with old friends you hadn't seen in a few years....    The movie still has the same cast of actors playing the roles of characters we've come to know and love. Everything in the movie clicked and felt right from the storyline, the funny situations and the blips that happen along the way. Watching the movie version of \\"Sex & The City\\" was like watching an extended version of one of the television episodes, letting us, the viewers, see where & what the characters are up to now.     The entire movie was well done. If you liked the television series, then you'll like the movie too.
1569474680|3.0|This is definitely one of those books which should be read for the journey rather than the destination.  The solution to the central mystery was contrived and unlikely, and ultimately unsatisfying.  The reader is left uncertain as to how much of the earlier narrative was true and what this says about the sanity or otherwise of both Alice and David.  Despite this flaw however, I thoroughly enjoyed 95% of the book.  It was a gripping psychological thriller which kept me turning the pages.  Worth a read if you don't expect too much from the ending.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|many of the songs from this concert are same as from the last dvd, 'remember that night'.the question then becomes - so what? As most can guess, each performance of music is always different - each time it is reinterpreted, caressed and massaged into perfection, yet unique. This is the case with Live in Gdansk, and my reaction was one of sheer aural bliss.<br />I thought the ending of 'take a breath' was transcendent, with Gilmours' and his friends' playing with the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony Orch. was literally stunning. Gilmour's voice is dark chocolate silk on my favorite 'pocketful of stones'. Richard Wright, his last appearance unfortunately, god bless this angel and may he rest in eternal joy, received a roar from the crowd who then broke into a chant of 'richard..richard..' . If you can stay dry eyed after that you are a stronger person then I am.<br />'Astronomie Domin&eacute;' and 'echoes' are simply astounding,aurally perfect.<br />Gilmour once again soars into comfortably numb, which has been voted the best guitar solo ever performed. These cd's and DvD's are simply something no floyd fan could possibly afford to miss.<br />the number of songs in this dvd + cd, with the dvd performances of the other included excerpts from concerts and the barn jams, the documentaries, make this set worth every penny it cost.<br />I don't know how many more concerts can be expected from Gilmour, many of us are getting a bit older, but 'pulse', 'remember' and this concert from Poland are simply gifts that i have been privileged to have experienced. thank you David.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|I thought all of Enigma's previous CD's were great, but \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\" is even more amazing than their previous ones.  It has a mixture of beautiful sounds, which are so other-worldly that it gave me chills.  And you can't help but get up and start dancing to the unusual sounds and rhythms. Love, love Enigma!
0064400557|3.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Well.  I liked all but the ending.  It's written in a way that it's interesting, although the details are really annoying, but the dialogue is all very child-friendly and realistic [even though it's animals talking XD]<br />Charlotte should not have died.  That was a horrible ending, and way too obvious, couldn't be any more predictable.  If she absolutely had to die, there shouldn't have been all those prior hints, it was just too much.  I mean, is there anyone who didn't cry upon her death when they read this book as a child?  You can't not cry.  It's heartbreaking to the little kid reading the book that their favorite character is dead.  Charlotte symbolizes that adult in everyone's life that they unconditionally love, and NO, this is not a good way to introduce death to children, it's traumatic.<br />But um...other than that random rant, great book.  Love all the random characters, and I'm kind of disheartened by the lack of love I see towards Templeton!<br />I dunno.  I guess analysis in class has kind of ruined the childish magic of the book for me...

0767903862|4.0|I read this book before returning to Australia after forty years. I'd been there as an exchange student in 1967 and returned in 2008 with my grown son, for two weeks. I'd asked my son to read it to after I finished so that he'd have an idea what Australia was about. Bryson reports fairly and with humor. Even though it's been a while since it was written, what he wrote still holds true, although we found the music in public transportation in South Australia was all the way up to the 1980s, not the 1950s!     My only gripe with the book is his editorializing about how Australia has treated the Anangu (aboriginals). Americans have no moral high ground to stand on with respect to how we've treated native peoples. And while I do not pretend any expertise in the history or current affairs of Australia and aborigines, I believe Bryson's opinions in this area are inappropriate.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I really like this album.  The music is great - Metallica doing what they do best.  The lyrics aren't as strong as Puppets and the sound could be better as many have noted.  However, this is the best Metallica album since ...and Justice for all.  The multi-layered assault is there, along with the time shifts, aggressive rhythm guitar, and everything else Metallica can deliver.  In the Metallisphere this is easily a top 5 album, just below Puppets and Justice and above Lightning.
0316010669|5.0|\\"Blink\\" almost instantly made it to my shelf of favorite books of all time.  I won't go into a detailed description of Gladwell's theory of thin-slicing, as other reviewers have already done this in all the detail you need to know before you decide to purchase this book (which I highly recommend you do)  Instead, I'll tell you what I took away from \\"Blink\\", and why I think it's such an important read.    \\"Blink\\" is more than just a series of entertaining anecdotes that support his theory.  It is a book of lessons that provide insight into our minds, and the minds of those around us.  Armed with this knowledge, we are better prepared to not only understand our own decision-making process, but to see, for a blink of an eye, what others are seeing when they make decisions about us.  Many of the experiments and studies he describes contain information that can be directly applied to one's life.     A good example of this is the study done in Germany that turns our idea of `feeling happy' on its head.  While everyone knows that when you're happy, you smile, a team of German scientists found that it works in reverse as well.  The simple act of smiling improves your mood.  One could just take this interesting factoid and store it in the lumber room of your mind along with all the other trivia.  I chose to make it relevant.  I can't tell you how many times it's happened since reading this book that I felt angry, frustrated, impatient, or irritated in some way, and then turned my mood around just by forcing myself to smile for a little bit.      Another sub-chapter of the book (\\"Arguing with a Dog\\") describes what Gladwell calls \\"temporary autism\\", a kind of mind-blindness that occurs when one is excited or stressed to the point that the heart rate rises above 145.  I found this chapter very helpful in understanding the physiological process, as my work often requires me to deal with very stressed out people. (It helped with some easily excitable friends too!)      The sub-chapter titled \\"The Storytelling Problem\\", which detailed the vast difference between what people say they want in a mate and what they are in fact attracted to, made me feel a lot better after reading it.  After years of hearing women describe their \\"perfect man\\" to me, and then seeing them fall for a perfect jerk instead, I've gotten more than a little frustrated.  But now I know there is a psychological reason for this insanity.  I wish I could make every single woman in the country read this chapter (or at least the single women in my city!)  On a similar note, I wish I could make everyone read the chapter called \\"The Warren G. Harding Error\\", which details the power of looks and our subconscious predilection for \\"tall, dark, and handsome\\" men.  This chapter is especially relevant in an election year, when we are looking at our two candidates and judging them.  Do we really know upon what basis we are judging?  Are TRULY picking the best man for the job, or are we voting on who has made the more \\"presidential\\" first impression?  As much as most people won't admit that race plays any part in their vote, mightn't it anyway, even among those people who truly DO deplore racism?  Do we like a candidate because of what he or she truly stands for, or are we voting for them because they smile more often, or joke more often, or were wearing our favorite color the first time we saw them?  One section of the book even describes how people can be \\"primed\\", subtly influenced to think and behave differently, at least in the short term.  Are we, as voters, being \\"primed\\" by the various media?  I think these are all very valid and relevant questions we need to ask ourselves.       This is what I took away from \\"Blink\\"- a deeper understanding of the decision-making process, and what factors assist or subvert it.  \\"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory\\" is a portrait of a decision-making model that works.  \\"Pepsi's Challenge\\" describes a situation where thin-slicing doesn't work out.  \\"TheChair of Death\\" describes an interesting hiccup in the thin-slicing process, where peoples' initial reaction can be negative, not because something is genuinely bad, but simply because it is unfamiliar.  And \\"Blink in Black and White\\", which not only relates the problem of automatic subconscious racial stereotyping (even of ones OWN race) but supplies a test you can do yourself, was nothing less than chilling.    OK, Gladwell is a writer, not a scientist.  If you're looking for an airtight theory complete with control group testing and a detailed analysis of every possible permutation of the concept, go read a scientific journal.  And, as another reviewer pointed out, he does tend to end his books with a thud rather than a conclusion.  Nonetheless, I think this should be required reading in every American high school.  The idea is that compelling, and the issues involved are that important.
B0015FML06|3.0|This isn't as much a review as a question.  Did anyone else notice that the Clannad song on track 1 (pre-concert footage) is very muted and pushed back? (It's a tad better on the closing credits, but still muted.) After an initial listen, I pulled out my well-worn VHS tape, and \\"Theme From Harry's Game\\" is right up front, which gives a very moody and contemplative intro to the concert footage.  I also thought the VHS sound is--overall--brighter and more alive than the DVD PCM remaster.  I know that The Edge has really emphasized bass on all his remasters, but here it seems to be at the expense of the high end and the drums.  I also know the trend in remastering these days is lots of compression, but normally PCM is supposed to be the least compressed of the formats, is it not?    I'd really appreciate an answer from someone, because I'm wondering if I got a bad pressing of the DVD, and need to return it.  Until I get that figured out, I'll stick with my 3-star rating.  Please comment on this issue. Thanks, Rick.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Pixar has always made great films and Cars is no exception.  The pure digital transfer looks beautiful in HiDef with a BluRay player and 1080p HDTV (Sony PS3 and Samsung 40\\" in my case).  Colors are spectactular.  I love the music and voice acting Pixar put together as well.  Click and Clack, the Tapert brothers from NPR as the Rusteeze owners was an especially nice touch.  The plot of the film is kid friendly but also takes adults back to the time when people drove cars to drive cars and meet people, not get somewhere.  Now the occasional car meet at the local drive in diner (if any are left in your town) is about all that is left of this culture.  Cars reminds us all of that time not long ago.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn was a fascinating book. I personally thought it was better than the rest. I liked how Stephenie Meyer brought the two main characters, Bella and Edward, together at last. I really liked the creative plot twists and how the conflicts were resolved. It always kept me on my toes and kept me looking out for what whould happen next. It was interesting that unlike many other books, this one was hard to predict. I like that in the end Stephenie Meyer brought suspense and puts the core characters lives in danger. The only criticism I have of this book is that it seemed to go on and on and on with too many details. At times I was ready to get to the end and skip some minor details. Out of 754 pages probably 50-70 pages could have been eliminated.   I recommend this book to all kinds of readers. Those that are already fans of the series should read this book cover to cover which isn't hard to do because once you begin you can't put it down. And anyone who hasn't started the series should do so because these books are excellent.
074356619X|5.0|I'm here to tell you IT WORKS. I was using the Secret long before I knew what it really was as I had learned it from authors like Napoleon Hill. Within 48 hours of watching the film, putting some affirmations on an mp3 player, playing them back to myself in the morning and at night...I had the first desire of my heart come into my life. The house of my dreams. It was..down to the very last detail...exactly what I had put on my mp3 player. Be specific, believe in magic, look within. Your whole world lies there, waiting for you to discover how powerful your mind is.<br /><br />I'm here to tell you it works. If you think it doesn't, I feel sad for you. Belief in yourself is what we all have been looking for.<br /><br />Be grateful for what you already have, and more will come to you. For each of us, what comes is as different as we are.<br /><br />So far, on my list, I've already accomplished 3 huge things just by believing they were on their way. One of these was to sell my house in 1 week when houses all around me had been sitting for as much as a year without selling.<br /><br />My realtor started believing after she saw the film and saw how we sold our house. And her houses started selling one after another. It was nothing short of miraculous. Negative, angry skeptics would say it was because she tried harder. Nonsense.<br /><br />And recently, I started listening to the audio book version, and it is even 100 times more inspiring and fascinating than the film was. Wow...<br /><br />Those who think like children and believe in dreams will love this book.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|After seeing a performance of Tennessee Williams' gripping play \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" at a local event, I immediately bought the award-winning film. I was unsure how a brutally powerful story about the demise of one woman's reputation could be translated into a film, but I was not disappointed. This two-disc set restores some of the \\"objectionable content\\" that almost derailed the film's production, and the movie is as enjoyable and thrilling as the play itself, with the exception of an ending that was tweaked to appease 1950s sensibilities.<br /><br />The performances are simply stellar. Brando is both hilarious and frightening in his breakout role as Stanley Kowalski, and Vivien Leigh turns in a graceful and haunting performance as Blanche DuBois, the Southern belle whose attempts to right her world when she moves in with her sister Stella and sister's husband Stanley go hopelessly awry.<br /><br />Funny, heartbreaking and moving \\"Streetcar\\" is a classic.

1416575464|2.0|I just received this book last night and was quite disappointed.  First, the size is too small-it is smaller than the magazine and the images are just not large enough.  Second, I had hoped that Domino would have included new  photos of rooms, not just a rehashing of old images.  I can look through my collection of Domino magazines if I want to see the same rooms and read the same text.  Not very inspirational or interesting.  Save your money.
B000002J1U|5.0|The light/heavy ideas of Led Zeppelin really come to fruition with the third where much has been written about its obvious folk leanings, certainly Page's twelve string guitar is a treat but these arrangements have the orchestrated detail of a symphony. This musical collage doesn't in any way impede the powerful sense of spontaneity, with Bonzo creating a jazz feel to keep his boogie backbeat loose (dig the extended coda to Out On the Tiles).    The single release for this album was the magnificent Immigrant Song, a Viking saga in miniature but Zep III also contains what may be considered their finest moment with Since I've Been Loving You; a monumental piece that provides big climaxes for stretching Plant's rambling vocals, to where he delivers all the feverish emotions of an Anglo-Saxon blues opera, while Jimmy Page's flowing guitar solo has incomparable strength. The sheer transcendence of these two tracks alone makes accusations of plagiarism seem irrelevant!     Led Zeppelin covered a lot of musical ground in a very short space of time but with their third album a mature disenchantment begins to show through as on That's the Way, the black humour to Gallows Pole, and Since I've Been Loving You; proof that the blues creeps into every corner of peoples lives. Despite negative experiences Zep's optimistic spirit surged on.    Alongside all of this one can't help but feel the fine touch of John Paul Jones arranging talents combining with those of Jimmy Page; married to that sophistication is the creative rawness, range and energy of Robert Plant and John Bonham. No small wonder then that the results are of a volcanic artistry way out of reach of any heavy metal band. Consequently I've often found the fourth or so called Runes album bordering on the bland in comparison to this jewellery box.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This album is awesome! On first listen i was a little disapointed as it felt like the hooks Trivium had used with their previous albums had gone and replaced with just performance. After listening to it a few more times i cannot say there it one song i don't like and all members playing is excellent on every track!
B0018M6J90|4.0|This movie is not about realism but its an escapist film.  The performances are a bit over the top, just like Hepburn/Tracy/Grant type films.  The plot is thin and the appeal lies in the creation of pre WW2 London.  Adams and McDormand carry the film and the men are mainly supporting their storyline.  Adams shows her range as an ambitious singer who uses men to further her career and lifestyle.  McDormand plays an out of luck nanny who's still trying to find security.  She and Adams have a type of mother/daughter relationship.  This type of film is not for everyone as it can become overly sweet and implausible.  The trick is to let yourself fall into the fantasy world and enjoy 2 great performances.
0143038419|4.0|This book has great humor and her description of places and her thinking is impeccable. BUT, with that being said, her trip to India took forever and could've been shortened in the book.  I liked her open mindedness to other belief systems and opportunities. I wish she would've described more of the love with Felipe to balance out the lust factor. I like the colorful people she meets, esp. Richard from Texas. Overall, with the exception of India's chapters going on forever, I love this book and feel it is a great read.

1416575464|5.0|Unlike the previous reviewer, I adore my new Domino book. First of all, the compact size is perfect for throwing in your bag when you decide to hit the shops and boutiques. You can pull it out and it lays flat easily; the sections are divided into easy to read and easy to access room-by-room descriptions that make referencing easy. Each section starts with layout, then design, then accessories and tips and in true Domino fashion, the tone is casual, friendly and accessible. There's nothing snotty or stuck up about Domino, which is one reason I love it. Second, I'm glad they used material from past issues. I certainly don't have the room to save all my magazines! For those unacquainted with the Domino magazine ethos - green, friendly, idiosyncratic and affordable design for all - this is a great intro to the monthly features and to home design itself. I think the thing i love most is the subtitle: \\"a room by room guide to creating a home that makes you happy\\" which, in these volatile, dangerous, lean economic and political times, is especially meaningful.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I am a bit old now to be a Metal music listener but as a former Metallica band fan, I should say I liked this album. It sounded like their old stuff. I didn't like the St. Anger album. It was crap, I think. But this one is a stellar performance from a proud band. Good one!
B00005K9LM|4.0|Definitely the last of the classic albums. It's a solid rocker, but I still hold Stained Class as the ultimate Priest masterpiece.
B001CLG6RC|4.0|Enigma suddenly released their seventh album only 2 years after A Posteriori, and it's easily one of the best ones they've released!  While the lackluster A Posteriori went for a more new age sound, Seven Lives Many Faces returns to the days of Enigmas 1-4, only with a more modern element.  The album is heavy on samples of chants (particularly in the second half), but it also features very heavy beats and basslines, which makes this their most ambient and trance-like outing yet.  This goes perfectly with the miscellaneous swirls of soundscapes that move this album along.  The production on it is outstanding!  To me, the music sounds perfectly layered, almost 3D.  You can listen to it on headphones and always hear new nuances whispering in the background with each listen.  Standout tracks include \\"The Same Parents\\" (easily the most moving Enigma song ever), \\"Touchness\\", \\"Hell's Heaven\\" and the string & hip-hop infused \\"Seven Lives\\".    Included also is a bonus disc containg 4 extra songs and a remix of \\"The Language of Sound\\".  The extra songs are even more abstract than those found on the album, but they're stunning nonetheless.  I would compare them to the songs found on Nine Inch Nails' experimental Ghosts I-IV album, but Enigma style.    Overall, this album is extraordinary!  While it's not my pick for best Enigma album ever (that honor goes to Voyageur), it's still one of their strongest and most complete offerings.
B00005JPO1|2.0|At the age of 12, I loved the Temple of Doom when it came out.  I re-watched it before seeing the new Indy, and man, is it silly.  So maybe the 12 year olds and younger will like the Crystal Skull in the same way I loved Temple of Doom as a kid.  Good for them, and I do not want to take away from anyone's enjoyment of this movie.  Clearly Spielberg/Lucas have targeted this movie to the 12 year old audience.  But 12 year olds today are way more sophisticated than I was back in the day, and I think Spielberg and Lucas have seriously underestimated them.  [spoilers ahead] There is one truly gripping sequence - the opening chase through the warehouse is pretty cool.  The rest of the action scenes are not so gripping because there is simply no sense of danger at all in this movie. Its like a lame theme park ride.  The whole movie is about Indy trying to find a second-rate  plastic Halloween decoration called the crystal skull.  I love movies about aliens.  I love Indy movies.  It does not follow that I love Indy movies about aliens.  And Shia trying to be Brando from the Wild Ones?  Give me a break.  I am sure Shia is a nice fellow, but he is bland in this role.  And what's up with the terrible CGI animals?  Were the Ewoks not available?   From the prairie dogs at the beginning to the monkey near the end, the CGI animals wouldn't have made the cut for Evan Almighty cast.   The real snakes in the first Indy are much more scary than a bunch of computer cartoon ants.  And Cate Blanchett - is she supposed to be remotely threatening?  Harrison Ford is the only saving grace, and only because of him is it a watchable movie.  If you are a die hard fan of this series you may want to see it out of curiosity.  But remember, you can't unsee it, and it could tarnish your whole view of the series.
0375826726|4.0|This was a very good book from the start. It was very easy to pick up the story from where it left off in Eldest. The best way I can explain this book to you without giving the plot away is that it reminded me a lot of the sixth book in the Harry Potter series. Not a lot of action, but good story and mainly written to set-up the final book. Many questions are answered and new questions are raised.    The only bad thing with the book, and the reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, was that at time it seemed the Paolini used a thesaurus for his text.    Unlike other reviewers, I understand that this is his first attempt at writing, and in my opinion it is pretty good. I can't wait to see what he comes up with in 20 or 30 years.    In closing, if you like the first two, and want to relax from a long, hard day, then this is the book for you.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I just watched \\"Donnie Darko\\" last night w/my son who is 16. My son said, he loved it, awesome. You can really take this movie 2 ways, not getting it at all, or totally loving it. I was somewhere in the middle. It was both funny, and chilling at the same time. It reminds me of a movie I saw a long time ago, called: Jacob's Ladder. Without spoiling the end of the flick for those who haven't seen it, I do encourage you to check it out. I saw someone's earlier review stating it was kind of like a Napolian Dynamite Nightmare, in that, it's again, kind of like, you either get it, or you don't. I can see alot of people coming off of this movie with a question mark....but, I totally get the end, it was fantastic. I saw it on cable, one of the reviews said they has watched the commentary a second time around, and connecting the dots was very well put. I can very much see how this flick has and will become a cult classic. Check it out!    ;)
0143038419|2.0|While the book is well written and sometimes amusing, it has an overall air of arrogance and self-indulgence.  It covers a lifestyle no one should want to copy.  After a while, the whole thing becomes sickening.
B00102FELM|2.0|As mentioned by other reviewers, this DVD is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds.  If you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details, forget it!  The editor(s) didn't do the Scorpions justice.  The music is good, but since this is a DVD and not a CD, I'm giving two stars for the spazoid video technique.
B00004RFFS|1.0|I think I've tried 2 or 3 times to watch this movie, but failed. This time I lasted about 20 minutes before I gave up, fast-forwarded, skipped chunks, and left before the end. It is quite incredibly boring. There's an interesting atmosphere to start with. Gradually you realise that it's all going nowhere, very slowly. Yawn, snooze. I've read all the one-star reviews and they all, except the one who's being funny and has reversed his star grading, hit the nail square on the head. I haven't read the book, or books, and I never will, now I've been exposed to this. I'm not a marathon film-watcher. Christopher Lee for ever! Cushing is ace!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I am one of the millions who felt a huge let down when 'St. Anger' came out. I am also one of the millions who wish that Metallica would do like some of their peers (Testament, Exodus, Slayer, Annihilator) and stick to what made them big...namely, blistering thrash songs with interesting story-style lyrics. That is why I was looking forward to 'Death Magnetic.' Everything I read said that it was a return to the 'Master of Puppets' style of music. When I first put it in my CD player and heard the opening that sounds like it could have been written during the 'And Justice For All' sessions, I was even more excited. The song definitely starts out on a thrash path, but then comes the verse and Hetfield's vocal delivery and I wasn't so excited anymore. The music for the verse is very good, but Hetfield sounds like he is still singing on 'St. Anger.' Instead of his sing/scream of yester-year, Hetfield almost talks the lyrics in a very mechanical way. Then comes the pre-chorus which sounds like it was written during the 'Re-Load' sessions. It's not bad, but not thrashy. The chorus is another big disappointment. It is more akin to punk rock than metal. It could have been made more interesting if they had done anything to it, but they just blandly down-stroke the chords. The good news is the song does have guitar leads. Overall, I would give the song a 3. If I had unlimited time and space I would write a blow by blow review of each song, but since I don't, it is safe to say that what I said about 'That Was Just Your Life' can be said for the album as a whole. There are some really great thrash parts that sound like the Metallica that we all love from the 80s. There are other parts that are like their 90s material: good, but not great. And, unfortunately, they just couldn't get St. Anger completely out of their blood, because they have parts that could easily have been included on that album and people would still say that it was a let down (for another example listen to thechorus of 'The End of the Line. It's truly awful). Buy the album because it's Metallica and there are some good parts, but don't expect Master of Puppets volume II.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|I really like this CD.  Some songs are a little creepy, like Disturbia and Question Existing.  I really like Breakin' Dishes and Shut up and Drive.  I would reccomend this CD if you have listened to and liked Rihanna's music before.
B001AQXZZA|2.0|My problem with the book was less with the writing than with the central character.  That said, her half-hearted, directionless but still self-important quest to find herself went on for too many pages before she finally realized it was just an affair.  Even that eventuality was lame as Mamah appeared more distressed about unpaid bills than she did about the effect of the sacrifices she'd been expecting from everyone all along.  The book might not have been such a painful read if it had been simply shorter.
0385340567|1.0|I won't belabour points that others have made so well.  Jack Reacher used to be so cool, but I won't be able to spend any more time with him after this sucker punch.
B000GRUS22|5.0|This is a GREAT album and if you're an Enigma fan you will already know that almost ALL of their CDs have ONE main 'tune' or melody that Cretu arranges/mixes in many different ways. I find myself humming one arrangement and skipping to parts of another track on the same CD. They blend together naturally. That's also the reason why most of the tracks continue on right into each other-without pauses in between.<br /><br />There is definitely a 'Cosmos' feel....i.e. futuristic/other-worldly feel to this CD.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|This is a great CD, it's as good as their others in its own way.  You are going to read other reviews that don't like this CD cause it doesn't sound like their other albums, and this is true it doesn't in a lot of ways, but if it did then these same people would rag on it cause it sounds to much like their other stuff and that they need to \\"grow\\" and \\"mature\\" their sound.  Which is what they are trying to do with this and their previous album.  So what I'm trying to say is I love this album, does it sound like their others?  No, but does that make this a bad album, No.  So take a listen for yourself and decide.
B00005JMX6|3.0|The Girl Next Door is the precursor to the highly successful Superbad. The film has a fomula feel to it. It features the \\"nerd\\" trio who seek sex before heading off to ivy league colleges; the madonna/whore good girl gone bad who is the nerd's object of desire; and a backdrop of stereotypes including good looking dumb jocks and oblivious parents.    The film works on a number of levels. The actors all have fine comedic timing, and the plot, while corny, has enough interest and twists to maintain interest. Most importantly, the r factor (drugs, sex and rock n roll) will engage most males 15-19.    A fun film.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|This series has the best story line, the best acting, and the best of every thing. When you watch it, it is as if you are there in the 50's and 60's. I really can't put into words just how good this series is. You just have to try it and then you'll say, I love it.

B001GAPC1K|4.0|There have been many good adaptations of comic book stories coming to theatres lately; it's truly a golden age for the super hero on the silver screen.  Iron Man is an enjoyable addition to this growing catalog of films, but it could have been truly outstanding with a few additions.<br /><br />The basic story is about a great industrialist who gets out of weapons manufacturing and into costumed heroism, having a change of heart after he spends some time imprisoned by warlords who have been acquiring his company's weapons.  This character turn had the potential to become preachy and obnoxious, but the movie wisely limits the peacenik blabbering to one minor character encountered early in the film.<br /><br />The movie underutilizes its two best assets: Tony Stark, and the suit.  Iron Man's combat suit is quite impressive, is equipped with a wide assortment of weapons, and seems to have enormous potential for elaborate action scenes.  Unfortunately, there is really only one scene in which we see him use the suit to its full capacity.  The film would have benefitted from one more big action sequence at that point in the story, or at least extending the scene we do have.  As for the man inside the suit, the character of Tony Stark is quite entertaining to watch when he's free to exchange verbal barbs with another character, or when he is let loose to adopt the larger-than-life billionaire playboy persona.  However, when he is constrained to trudge through plot-advancing dialogue, or when he has to share a more personal moment with another character, he seems to lose all his charm in an instant.<br /><br />But hey, if my biggest complaint is that I wanted more of a good thing, the movie must be doing alot of things right.  I solidly recommend it.<br /><br />PQ:<br />Blu-Ray picture quality was very good.  The only distracting digital noise I observed was when we see from a point-of-view inside the suit, which was clearly deliberate.  The daytime exterior shots are very nice, showing plenty of detail.  The dark, interior shots are not as impressive, but I've yet to see any movie on Blu-Ray that handled them perfectly.  Overall I would say the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is quite good, similar to (and maybe just a touch better than) Spiderman 3.dark, interior shots are not as impressive, but I've yet to see any movie on Blu-Ray that handled them perfectly.

0375826726|1.0|I am not going to offer up any spoilers, just my opinion.  The first book has some unique creativity.  Book 2 smacked of LOTR, Star Wars and serveral other author's concepts.  This book was highly disjointed, and is more fluff than a real adventure.  More than all else, Christopher's core theme of the books is truth, honesty and honor.  Is it his idea of honesty to change his \\"trilogy\\" to 4 books?  Had I known this wasnt the end, I would not have bothered to purchase it.   Even the synopsis above implies more than the book covers. Seems that Christopher now is milking his readers into purchasing another book. However, I for one, am done with this author.
1931559317|5.0|I wasn't sure what this atlas would be like.  I mean, how many stars could you pack into a \\"pocket atlas\\".  The answer - a lot.  This atlas, in fact, does a very good job at putting most of the important stars and deep sky objects found in the 2000 sky atlas.  The thing that impressed me the most, however, was the layout and organization of the book.  After struggling for years with trying to find the right page or chart to see a particular portion of the sky, this atlas makes that job easy.  It's opened up an whole world of casual sky browsing.  Of all the atlases and guides I own (about 10), I like this the most.

0679746048|4.0|It's actually one of the better memoirs of recent vintage (it came out in 1993 and became a bestseller in 2000, with the film's release). Not that SK is very insightful about her `borderline personality' disorder, nor capable of extended moments of insight nor poetry, but she compensates for her lack of great craftsmanship in wordplay and sentence/paragraph construction with a daring approach to the memoir.<br /><br /> The book, with larger than normal print, is not even 170 pages in the Vintage edition I read, and there's plenty of white space, as well as transcripts of SK's mental diagnoses within. In a sense, this sets up the piece to be quite poetic. In fact, this is where the poesy of the prose comes from, not the ability to craft gorgeous prose. Most of the few dozen `chapters' are brief- 3-4 pages is usual, and they are often dreamy or hazy recollections that sometimes briefly, violently come into focus, in describing a fellow patient's ill or death. In other chapters SK goes off rambling about mental ills, philosophy, her sexual precocity, and other things. While many of these individual reminiscences and airies fall flat, the way they are woven together and contrast with each other allow make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />  This synergy got me to thinking of a poetic equivalent, and the manifest answer was the long Maximus poem series by Charles Olson- another Massachusetts resident. In that poem series, one of the few `experimental' works of poetry that actually coheres and is good, CO strings together many poems about his hometown, yet each poem/stanza is, in a sense, lacking- it fails as an individual work because it is incomplete. Yet, read one after the other the incomplete figurines each `poem' makes connect up. It's like looking at a single Matissean line on a piece of tissue paper. The individual curves and twists seem random until you lay each tissue paper over the next. Then, the full, intricate, and interesting picture emerges. Such it was in CO's poem sequence, and such it is in SK's memoir- each `chapter' a single line, sometimes non-chronological, that gives a better representation of her mindset than any straightforward prose could. Interestingly, in looking up reviews of the book, I was struck by how not a single published review (at least those online) ever mentioned this, even though the form of the book jumped out at me. This is evidence of piss poor criticism. It's akin to reviewing the first edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass, dismissing it as smutty, and not even commenting on the breakthrough structure of the free verse.<br /><br />  There is little bitching, and poseur pity.... In short, Girl, Interrupted is a very good work, and what any memoirist should strive to achieve. The very fact that many critics criticized it for, when boiled down, not filling their conventional needs as a reader, and chose to review it against what what they wanted (expected) it to be, argues for its specialness, and I'd bet that it will be read long after Prozac Nation or A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius have gone out of print.

0345440900|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my sister when I was about to lose my mind from lack of sleep. My 7 month old was waking up multiple times during the night and always took short naps throughout the day. Being my second child, I assumed that I could do what I did with my first. Offer to breasfeed him whenever he woke up, needed to sleep, or was fussy. I guess that I took the \\"feeding on demand\\" to an extreme. I picked this book up and read through it in a day (I skipped a lot of the parts about newborns as I was well beyond that point). I tried her recommended techniques, specifically pick up/put down and her suggestions about establishing set routines, and to my absolute amazement my little toughie responded incredibly well. The first three nights were brutal, but by night four he was sleeping 11-12 hours straight. He has also drastically improved with his napping. I am now recommending this book to everyone. I breastfed my first child for 12 months and am planning on doing the same for this one. I did not feel once that the author was trying to talk me out of breastfeeding. I think that it is nice that she offers encouragement for both sides as I have a lot of friends who chose not to breastfeed and they receive a lot of negative comments from breastfeeding advocates. Neither of my kids took pacifiers either (why would they they had me), so I ignored any suggestions about them. The basic ideas make a lot of sense and unfortunately following my maternal instincts led my down a very sleep deprived path. This book saved me!
0486424545|3.0|Simply put, EMF is no Wilde, not even close. His characters are, in a sense, the stock sort of British characters one is well familiar with from PBS productions like Masterpiece Theater, or the Merchant Ivory films of the 1990s. In fact, this book was adapted into a well regarded film by that company back then. Yet, I could not shake free the notion that this solid book would have been infinitely better in the hands of a master like Wilde. There is none of the witty repartee, and none of the ferocious characterization. Yes, Wilde's plays were comedies, while this book is not really a comedy, but I kept thinking, it should be a comedy.<br /><br />  Howard's End is the name of a wealthy estate that entails the lives of two clans- the wealthy Wilcoxes and the plebeian Schlegels. There are all of the typical episodes of class envy and snobbery, a possible budding romance between a wealthy scion and a poor girl, and the like, but the meat of the tale kicks off when Margaret Schlegel and the matrician Mrs. Wilcox become buddies, with the old lady hobnobbing with young Margaret's pseudo-intellectual bohemian pals. The two women then holiday at Howard's End, the Wilcox estate, and bond more closely. Mrs. Wilcox then dies, but not before willing Margaret Howard's End after finding out Margaret's clan are about to lose their home....it's the look into Wildean heaven that most undoes EMF. Let me give you just a few samples of the difference. Here is a quote that seems to be quite Wildean:<br /><br />  `It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. That is not imagination. No, it kills it.'<br /><br />  Note that there is no real hyperbole, the speaker is rather dour. There is a ruing, without a wink. Perhaps a better quote is this:<br /><br />  `What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?...Haven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion? I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you were one of these.'<br /><br />  Again, note the dourness and resignation. Wilde, were he expressing either of these sentiments, would have done so with more flair, uplift, and bite. These are not examples of bad prose, mind you. They are good- even very good, and that's the difference- Wilde and his characters are utterly brilliant!<br /><br />  A final quote:<br /><br />  `Love and Truth-- their warfare seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.'<br /><br />  I do believe Prospero, in Wilde's hands, would be far from reconciled. But, again, that may just be my lack of weaning from the Master. In short, the tale told is by no means unique, and its preachments rather bald, but it is solidly told, and in comparison to the dreck of recent years one may regard Howard's End as a classic. It's just in light of its contemporaries it shines less brightly.<br /><br />  In a sense, this sort of tale, when stripped down for a film or PBS production, works better, because it is shorn of its soap operatic worst elements of unimportant sub-stories, yet, damn it, without the Wildean wit, I ask, why bother to lather up?t enter into our daily lives?...Haven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion?

B000002H33|5.0|Despite my decidedly non-metal oriented tastes, I'm a pretty big fan of Metallica. Especially this album, a pure masterpiece, Metallica's greatest album ever. Ride the Lightning is also an excellent album, but I'm not a big fan of \\"Escape.\\" By contrast, I can think of NOTHING to complain about here. Wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor, every song is very close to perfect.<br />Choosing highlights on this album is hard, but one that especially stands out to me is \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium).\\" I've always loved Metallica's power ballads, and this is arguably the best of them. It's my favorite Metallica song after \\"Fade to Black,\\" a haunting song undercut with strong emotions of anger and confusion.<br />Also great on this album (I mean, besides everything) are the three extended epics on this thing. The title track and \\"Disposable Heroes\\" both speed through piles of brilliant riffs with surprisingly great melodies. The title track is a just classic, one of Metallica's greatest songs ever, but for some reason \\"Disposable Heroes\\" gets something of a bad rap. But it's amazing as the title track, with just as many spectacular riffs. And the instrumental \\"Orion\\" is even better than the previous album's \\"Call of Ktulu,\\" which was a classic to begin with. Not bad!<br />Ah, and those other four songs score big points, too. \\"Battery,\\" \\"Damage Inc.,\\" and \\"Leper Messiah\\" all really work as fast, angry thrashers - I especially enjoy \\"Leper Messiah's\\" anti-Televangelist lyrics. And the Lovecraft-inspired \\"Thing That Should Not Be\\" is quite an eerie song, between its lyrics and the sound effects.<br />Some have complained that Master of Puppets borrows the sequencing from Ride the Lightning, and I can see that. Both albums open with a deceptive acoustic introduction that gives way to a powerful thrasher, move into a complex title track, which becomes a doomy, sound-effect laden song and, lastly, a power ballad. The second side contains three thrashers and one epic instrumental, though the instrumental here is second-to-last rather than last. But I think they PERFECT that formula here, so no complaints!<br />Another fantastic thing about this album is its lyrics. This is REAL stuff, not the D&D fantasies of Black Sabbath or the sex god decadence of Led Zeppelin (though I like both the Zep and Sab, don't get me wrong there). The lyrics are about drug addiction, insanity, child abandonment, religious hypocrisy, and other very real issues. Really down-to-Earth band, Metallica. Great one, too!l here is second-to-last rather than last. But I think they PERFECT that formula here, so no complaints!  Another fantastic thing about this album is its lyrics.

B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I discovered Avenged Sevenfold through their self-titled album and really enjoyed it so I decided to pick up another one of their albums. Little did I realize that they had changed their style so drastically from where they began. Waking the Fallen has very good guitar and drums and such and usually has a very catch rhythm and melody but unfortunately the singing, er screaming, just isn't up to par. If you're a hard rock/metal fan that enjoys being able to understand the words to a song don't pick up this album. This album would have been a hundred times better if the screaming was converted even to a shout. I'm not saying he should have tried to sing like he did in City of Evil and self-title but screaming definitely isn't the answer for any band.
0375826726|3.0|After reading \\"Eldest,\\" with all those numerous uses of the words \\"ablutions\\" and \\"crimson,\\" I wondered which words he'd overuse in this book. This time, it's \\"countenance\\" and \\"crimson\\" (again). It's definitely pretty noticeable that Paolini is looking for any chance he can get to extend these books (the Dwarves' clanmeet), but there are quite a few cool action scenes. Unfortunately, the book is bogged down in countless talks of politics that bored me to tears, but overall, I liked the characters, and the relationship between Eragon and Saphira is touching.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Ah, 70s science fiction... ridiculous costumes, campy visual effects, social commentary... and an underlying weirdness you just can't ignore. Logan's Run is something like THX 1138, only to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World instead of Orwell's 1984. And in the words of the character Logan himself, \\"It all made sense until Box...\\" In the future, mankind survives in a mall-like bubble of society that entirely subsists off of pleasure and materialism. Everyone is forced to die at the age of 30, basically to prevent the knowledge of suffering from getting into their minds. Those who do not want to die at 30 are \\"runners\\" that get tracked down by \\"sandmen\\" who blast them with what essentially amounts to flare guns. Despite this, the walls are not TOO scorched with spent rounds, and most people go on happily. Unfortunately for the status quo, this world is a lie and not everyone is happy, resulting in one particular sandman, the eponymous Logan 5, to have to become a runner himself.<br /><br />There are some pretty bizarre scenes in the lieu. The whole rite of the carousel is actually quite disturbing if you think about it. An entire quadrant of the city is filled with derelicts and gangmembers, and of course this part is the one called \\"The Cathedral\\". On the other hand, there's visual candy as well, with superb modeling for the cityscapes and, yes, Jenny Agutter in a miniskirt that only gets more revealing as it slowly falls apart over the course of the movie.<br /><br />Unlike THX 1138, Logan's Run doesn't end upon successful exit of the city; that's only the first half. Afterward the audience is treated to a gorgeous vision of the empty and abandoned Washington D.C. The movie kind of drags at this point, but is made up for mostly by the disturbing visions of American landmarks in various states of decay. When all else fails, science fiction's greatest asset is the ability to displace the audience with what they feel are familiar landscapes--just look at Planet of the Apes or 28 Days Later...<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable movie, nonetheless. People who like the fact that Star Wars is a Campbellian construction of the Hero's Journey should definitely check this movie out--it might as well have been the primary source for George Lucas' later work. And for science fiction fans as a whole, it's a classic example of the form.<br /><br />But MAN, was that robot and the ice cave WEIRD.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBter...

B00005NTJK|5.0|I was in high school when I first heard Jethro Tull. Back in those days I had the vinyl of both these albums. My friends and I watched as Tull transformed into a blues / rock giant! To finally find the replacements after searching off and on for years is amazing. Thank You Amazon!
B0000C9JCM|5.0|I can listen to any Pachabel collection, but this one is great.  I play it over and over & can never get sick of it!
0345494997|4.0|The book is immensely readable, however I could not reconcile Mamah abandoning her children with the deeply thoughtful person Horan paints her to be.  She had to be more self-absorbed than she appears on these pages.  DO NOT make the mistake I did and reasearch the characters before finishing this book.  I inadvertently discovered the shocking end to the story by reading on-line articles about FLW.  Mamah was woman born 100 years too early. FLW was, by Horan's account, irresponsible, a terrible money manager, and quite the narcissist.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|This album is excellent.  They take the best of Ascendancy and The Crusade and combine them to produce there best album yet!  The DVD has the making of the album along with instructions on how to do the riffs on the songs.  I would have liked some music videos or some live performances on the DVD but I gotta say, I love this album and honestly think that the quality you get is fantastic.  My fav metal album this year.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Here is the King at his best. The subtitle \\"30 #1 HITS\\" is slightly misleading, because you get the bonus track of \\"A Little Less Conversation.\\" I can't imagine life without \\"Don't Be Cruel,\\" \\"It's Now or Never,\\" \\"Return to Sender,\\" \\"Suspicious Minds\\" and \\"Burning Love\\"! These are a few of my favorite Elvis songs. Your favorites will be on this CD too! A must have for loyal fans of the King!
B001CLG6RC|5.0|This latest effort from Enigma is, in my opinion, on par with Enigma 3. Simply breath taking. I have been listening to this on my iPod around campus for the last 12 hours and all I can say is that I cam thoroughly impressed. Same Parents has one of the coolest messages and the song itself certainly expresses the melancholy found in the lyrics. Overall, the album is amazing. Same Parents, however, particularly stood out for me just because of the message. I would have to concede in that, this album has become my new fav from Enigma. It does not disappoint. Bravo Michel Cretu, bravo.
0670034711|5.0|having been to many of the places she is describing I really appreciated the humor in her descriptions (especially how she describes the Indonesian island of Bali and the people there is simply hollarious!!!). She manages to really make you like her in this book and you feel close to her after reading it....she could be a Guru herself but I reckon she already sorta is. I have friends with depressions and it really helped me to grasp what they have to go through. She is a refreshing honest and direct person, reading about her was fun and entertaining and did leave me with lots of value and ideas what all I personally should do or stop.
1592332803|5.0|I really like this cookbook. I agree with other posters that it doesn't focus on super-healthy recipes, but she clearly states that most of the items in the book are treats in which one should indulge only occasionally. The ingredients are pretty easy to find and you can always substitute whole wheat or alternative flours and other ingredients if you so desire. I, for one, really enjoy having a traditional kind of baking book in vegan form. It makes it much easier to make things that I know all of my omnivorous friends will like, and it's not always easy converting recipes myself. The photos are lovely, and almost every recipe I've made from this book has turned out very well. I even bought a copy for my non-vegan mother, and I know that she's used it a few times when baking for her friends.     Another thing I really like about the book is that it includes short educational sections about the negative aspects of dairy and egg production, and on good baking techniques.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|My husband and I happened to stumble on to this movie. We first heard about it from some award show (maybe the Emmy's) last year. This movie won best song and when they accepted their award we noticed first because of their heavy irish accent, but also becasue they were so genuinely excited about it! So once we saw it come on one of the movie channels we had to watch it. We were both so moved how amazing this movie was for it's simplicity, love and heartache the main character portrays, and wonderful music. It even brought me to tears at one point. I think if you have ever loved someone and had a bad breakup or just even missed that person you will relate to this movie. It's really great, I'm telling you. We had to buy the movie and the soundtrack and add it to our collection. Totally recommend it :)
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  A few times, I laughed aloud- quite unusual for me if I am alone reading.  Honestly, I was sorry when I finished the book-
B0007M22TI|5.0|An excellent product. I had the CD and now I have the DVD. I saw them perform live in the DFW area and just wish they had more recordings.
B00008NRI8|3.0|This seems like a dream match-up. As likeable and engaging as these two stars are, this film suffers from a weak script and direction. It never reaches cruising speed, but just plods along. There is unfunny scene after scene, many with clumsy resolution, the actors just standing there looking uneasy. What should have been a bunch of perfectly written and executed small character roles were mismanaged and presented, none truly having any bearing on the story. This is not an awful film, it can be enjoyed, but sadly it didn't reach it's full potential.
B001AJVR5M|3.0|The most incredible thing about The Jonas Brothers' \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" is just how much it doesn't blow chunks: the youngsters in my family really dig on this CD, and I am actually pretty glad about that for a couple of reasons. The sound is unabashedly power-pop in orientation and I am not having to wonder how to explain away cuss words or the incessant crass commercial pandering (think Gwen Stefani's wretched [[ASIN:B00064AEJW Love Angel Music Baby]]). The two lead songs, \\"BB Good\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" are the kind of crunchy sugar-pops Eric Carmen churned out in his prime [[ASIN:B00006YX8N Raspberries]] days. I could even picture [[ASIN:B00004YC1W Robin Zander]] wrapping his pipes around \\"BB Good\\" and the halfway decent ballad \\"Sorry.\\"<br /><br />For now, that's about as far out the limb as I'll go for The JB's. Teeny Bopper Filler starts to intrude after the 4th song (the dreadful \\"Lovebug\\") and the songs start to blend together. As a collection of hit-singles-to-be, however, \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" beats the pre-digested pabulum turned out by most of the manufactured 90's Boy Bands (that the brothers write their own material and do the bulk of the playing most certainly helps) and their ain't a forced-dance number to be found. Given that the title track is a song written about Nick's diabetes, the boys are starting to turn their pens towards more personal matters. They may escape the trap [[ASIN:B000001ES7 Hanson]] fell into (after all, they did not have a weekly Disney Show to back them up: \\"Video Girl Syndrome\\" indeed), but like many under-rated Teen Idols of the past ([[ASIN:B000000D3I Shaun Cassidy]], [[ASIN:B00006830V The Monkees]]), The Jonas Brothers may have more up their sleeves than many bargain for.
B001BKXUOQ|3.0|This album is a little different than previous. It has a bit less angst I feel. Several tracks have more Corey Taylor Stone Sour sound. I like it the more I listen to it. Don't even waste your time watching the DVD. It is just a bunch a video clips of them in various parts of recording. No interviews or anything to make you feel connected to the band, like seeing them goof around.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|The Kings of Leon sound like they're going for broke here. While the previous album, [[ASIN:B000MRA3NU Because of the Times]], the slickness was creeping in but the wild hairs still had not been completely plucked (Example: the wild screeches on \\"Charmer\\"). However, for album four, the grease and the grit is all but vanished. The Followills still sound distinctly southern and still are a singular voice in the current pop population, but the songs here all sound like the edges have been sanded down.<br /><br />That's not to say \\"Only By The Night\\" is a an album to avoid, far from it. On a level of consistency, it's easily better than \\"Because\\" and maybe better song for song than [[ASIN:B00078XKD4 Aha Shake Heartbreak]] (my personal favorite KoL CD). The spacey groove of the opener \\"Closer\\" gets things off to a promising start and \\"Crawl\\" has a fuzzy crunch that is prime Followill. And while it is the catchiest thing on the disc, \\"Sex On Fire\\" is a bit pat.<br /><br />Then comes the oddest moment, as the Kings go into full-on anthem mode for the single \\"Use Somebody.\\" All those comments about the effects of touring with [[ASIN:B0006399FS U2]] all come to roost here, as the song aims Matthew Followill's guitar into the reverberated heavens and the vocals pile on like so many layers of home fries. It's the most obvious single the band has ever done, and then \\"I Want You\\" slinks along with another KoL song about dopey sex (think of \\"I'd come all over your party but I'm soft\\" on ASH or \\"you caught me with my pants down\\" from BotT) and swagger. And I love the picked solo here.<br /><br />Along the lines of swagger, Caleb Followill has the cock of the walk rock singer style down on this CD. From the eerie wails of \\"Cold Desert\\" to the strutting confidence of \\"Be Somebody\\" and \\"Sex on Fire,\\" he's becoming more and more assured a vocalist with each passing CD. Much like the gradual maturation of Chris Robinson's style as [[ASIN:B00112A6HS The Black Crowes]] kept on plugging, Caleb's voice just keeps growing richer without losing his southern roots. You can even understand most of the singing on \\"Only By The Night,\\" and that's a good thing. Despite what some of the naysayers may have posted on the reviews, The Kings of Leon have gone four for four when it comes to making solid albums. This may be the Kings' smoothest album yet, but that does not make it a bad one. In fact, this may be one of 2008's best.ps growing richer without losing his southern roots.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|I do love this movie. Pure escapism and entertainment. What's wrong with that? I don't particularly think Kris K. was the best choice for the part, but he did have that burned out old hippie sensibility and he really did a fine acting job, conveyed sensitivity and the low self esteem of his character. Barbra was charismatic and despite that  really bad hairdo, quite adorable. Her singing and phrasing are just phenominal. Listen to her commentary, very enlightening and fascinating! I love how they did all the music live ! She explains why, and it really is what adds so much warmth and excitement to the music scenes. Such a 70's Los Angeles feel!<br />I shocked myself, after not seeing this movie for years, when I recently watched it again, damn! I needed Kleenex!! I could not believe this shmaltzy corny movie ( which I do love however) got me all teary eyed! There is something about Barbra's warmth and talent...I swear, people like to bash her, but really, there are little to no \\"stars\\" like her anymore. The woman is gifted, truly.
0375826726|1.0|What a disappointment!  The first book was great, the second quite good, the last one long, very disjointed and boring.  I was intrigued that a teenager wrote Eragon.  But it is a shame how this has turned from a great story to a disappointing money making scheme. I guess they want to continue milking this success ... shame on you Paolini!    If Paolini contained his story in a trilogy, as promised, these books would stay in my library.  Now, I just want to throw them away so that my kids don't get sucked into wasting time on the series.    Don't buy Brisingr, it is a waste of your time and money!

B000JK8OYU|5.0|OK, you are talking to a pretty jaded Beatles fan here. It seems that every 5 to 6 years, Capitol Records (and EMI) just have to push some new Beatles \\"product\\" on the unsuspecting public. Let's take a minute here and think at all of the compilations the just re-hash their original material. Past Masters, 1, Rock And Roll Music, Love Songs, Reel Music... (I know I am throwing in some old vinyl LP's here but you get the message)So when this came out you can imagine my lack of enthusiasm. Yeah OK, it's a soundtrack to a show. Big deal. Yeah so some of the songs have been remixed...mega yawn. Just another let's fleece the Beatles fan out of more money to prop up our business model this year album. A friend of mine told me to give it a listen...if I was half the Beatles (and music) fan he knows I am that I would enjoy it thoroughly. So I did. I put it in my CD player...and heard the birds chirping...and the vocal tracks of \\"Because\\"...then the swell started. Low, rising, getting louder until you hear the first crashing chord of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", and then starts this amazing CD. I turned it off after the first two songs, waiting for the weekend where I could hear the entire CD on my way down to the beach so it would not be interrupted.     What you have here is a CD remixed by the Beatles original producer, George Martin and his son. What they have done is taken parts of Beatles songs and mixed them with other Beatles songs, making what is refered to as a \\"mash-up\\". So in one track, you will actually hear \\"Drive My Car\\" infused with the guitar solo from \\"Taxman\\". My personal favorite mash-up is the vocals of \\"Within You Without You\\" mashed up with the instrumentation of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". The results are simply amazing.     Not every song gets this treatment though...for instance, the original demo for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is used with an orchetral score filling in the second and third verse. Absolutely beautiful. \\"Hey Jude\\" also deserves a mention because it's been shortened from the absolutely ponderous 7 minute version down, while at one point taking out everything except the vocals, then adding the bass in before everything comes in again. Makes me wonder why they didn't do that on the original version. Would have made it much more listenable and enjoyable in my opinion. Even if you know every song by heart, there is something a little different in each mix you can pick out from the original.    The only track to me that really doesn't sound good is \\"Octopus's Garden\\", it just tries too hard to fit in with the rest of the well-mixed songs and it just doesn't. Well, considering how great the rest of this CD is I can forgive its inclusion.    I know some people see this akin to painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa (which to me is a pretty elitist attitude). And this does have the opportunity to become a disaster, but with the Martins at the helm, this instead is an enjoyable career spanning CD. The words tastefully done I think are appropriate here. If you are a Beatles fan (new or old) I really cannot reccommend this CD enough. Everybody who has heard this just loves it. I just never get tired of listening to this CD, simple as that. Buy it!     T

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|THE FALL reminds me of films by Bergman, Fellini, and other such directors. It draws on the gamut of film techniques to create a world that is, beneath its ordinary surface, sublime and magical. The images are fantastic and beautiful, like the early paintings of Salvador Dali, the work of Magritte and Ernst. However, director Tarsem is not merely a visual artist, but also someone who can create those deep moods in which you question reality and consider the possibility of other ways of being. Truly a tour de force.

0930289234|5.0|Don't call me a comic book! I am one of Time magazine's top 100 \\"novels\\". And I won a Hugo. So there!<br /><br />Indeed. This 1985 graphic novel by comic book great Alan Moore is one of the most impressionable pieces of literature that I've read in years.<br /><br />Is Watchmen some comic book about superheroes? Wait! Who you callin' \\"comic book!?\\" And we'd prefer \\"costumed adventurers\\" instead of superheroes please...with the exception of one character in the book. The difference between superhero and costumed adventurer here is the difference between super-powers and plain old bravery and smarts. And just plain old bravery and smarts can't protect you from a bullet or a stronger man (or woman).<br /><br />So when one of the approximately five still practicing costumed adventurers is murdered, Rorschach, a tough, ink-blot mask wearing anti-hero makes it his business to find the killer and warn the other adventurers of a villain potentially bent on getting rid of the remaining \\"masks\\".<br /><br />I mentioned earlier \\"an exception\\" to the costumed versus super-powered adventurers...that exception is Dr. Manhattan. The question is not what can Dr. Manhattan do that's so special; the question is, what can't he do? So with a guy like Manhattan on your side...whether it's literally \\"your\\" side or say \\"your county's\\" side, ya can't lose, right?<br /><br />But what if Dr. Manhattan decided to skip town for a while? Yeah. Exactly. You guessed it. Like if Tiger Woods left golf for a season due to injury...who'd watch golf anymore? Who'd watch the Watchmen?<br /><br />Alan Moore tells a sensational tale here and Dave Gibbons brings the words to life. This novel is a must...not just for comic book and graphic novels fans, but for fans of Truth, Justice and the American Way! Add this to your cart.<br /><br />Side note: Speaking of bringing the words to life....It's no secret that Zack Snyder ([[ASIN:B000Q6GX5Y 300]]) plans to bring Watchmen to the big screen in 2009. Can't wait!!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This show is great, i loved it when it was on HBO and i just love all the girls!!!!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Color me stupid. I send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and I never watched Dexter until the first two seasons came out on DVD? What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.<br /><br />How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the series in like two weeks versus like 12 weeks per regular season. I think that we even watched three episodes in one night. Alas, season 3 started this week, and now it's one episode of Dexter one week at a time.<br /><br />So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.<br /><br />Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO's [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]] fame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.<br /><br />The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this \\"stuff\\" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />Add this bloody-good show to your cart. [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Season 1]] is just as good as season 2, so I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from the beginning.<br /><br />Buy both seasons, and get your Tivo going on season 3!
0739368044|5.0|I really enjoyed Brisinger. It is Christopher Paolini's best book yet. One of my favorite chapters is when Eragon, Roran and Saphira attack Helgrind.  It is amazing that the three of them dare to attack the fortress by themselves while trying to rescue Katrena. Another is when Eragon and Saphira attack Thoren again. I also liked the election of the next dwarf king I hope that Orik takes part in the siege of Uru'baen and I hope that he stays alive to witnness the final battle between Eragon and Gallbatorix. I hope that Eragon can defeat him.
B000007R1M|5.0|Forget Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\", Kraftwerk's \\"The Model\\" single-handedly invented synth-pop as we know it. The song is all melody, but it still has that certain chill that radio just didn't consider very friendly at the time. It could have been a huge hit in 1982, but in the year it was released, 1978, it didn't resemble disco, so it didn't get the attention it deserved. Gary Numan would have loved to have written this song. It remains probably Kraftwerk's most influential moment because of its eerie similarity to much of the synth-pop of the early 80's. Here's the best part though: \\"The Model\\" isn't even the best song on The Man-Machine. That honor goes to \\"Spacelab\\". While \\"The Model\\" influenced the synth-popsters, \\"Spacelab\\" influenced the more serious electronic artists such as Depeche Mode, Paul Oakenfold, the Chemical Brothers, and The Orb. \\"Spacelab\\" is the one song on The Man-Machine that sounds like it could be recorded today. It truly is a high-water mark for electronica. There really are no clunkers on the album. It is remarkably consistent. The only flaw, and it's a minor one, is that \\"Neon Lights\\" could be about two minutes shorter. It's the longest and least hypnotic song on the album, although it is not filler by any stretch of the imagination. I am a big fan of ambitious double albums, but The Man-Machine is proof that all you really need is about 38 minutes or so to churn out an ambitious masterpiece. Everything great about Kraftwerk is right here and it only continues to grow on you after repeated plays. When I think Kraftwerk, I think The Man-Machine.

B000TSJU0E|5.0|ZZ Top's 1983 MTV classic 'Eliminator' brought a change of scenary for the band. Gone are the days of the \\"Texas tornado blues effect.\\" This album is driven by the synthesizer work of Dusty Hill, who plays the synthsizers (uncredited), and does a pretty good job with it too.    After hearing 1981's 'El Loco,' I kind of figured ZZ Top was heading this way. And that's not a bad thing, either. While this isn't one of my all time favorite albums from them, it's still pretty awesome.    While I loved 'Sharp Dressed Man' and Hill's funky bass playing on 'Thug,' the real highlight to me on this album is 'I Need You Tonight,' a bluesy jam with no synths and no drum machines. Just Gibbons, Hill and Beard jamming. It could have easily been a hit on the 'Deguello' or 'Tejas' record.    'Legs' was a crucial MTV hit for the band; the video was extremely popular. 'Gimme All Your Lovin' was also a big single for the band, and achieved commercial success.    Another one of my all time favorite ZZ Top songs is 'Got Me Under Pressure.' It's one of their best songs, and definitely the second best song here (besides 'I Need You Tonight').    While I'll be the first to tell you that if I had the choice between 1981-1990 ZZ Top or the 1971-1980 ZZ Top, I pick '71-'80 every time. But, I really do enjoy 'Eliminator,' and it's much better than 'Afterburner' and 'Recycler.'    Now that I've talked about the album, let's move forward into the remastering and the \\"collector's edition\\" bonus disc:    -The sound quality is superb! Compare this to the original '90s Warner Bros. CD edition of this and you'll be stunned. There is no comparison, this is hands down the version to own.    -The DVD is awesome! Great music videos, although why is 'Tube Snake Boogie' on 'Eliminator' even though that appeared on 'El Loco'? I do question Warner Bros. move to include that here. It's almost like adding 'Sharp Dressed Man' as a bonus track on 'ZZ Top's First Album' from 1971.    Now, here are a couple of sidecomments that do not relate to the album or reissue, but are questions that I would like to know?    It's nice to see Warner Bros. reissuing the 1983 classic 'Eliminator,' but where the heck are the reissued versions of 'Tejas' and 'El Loco,' from 1976 and 1981, respectively? If you are gonna remaster 'Eliminator,' at least remaster those! Unlike some ZZ Top fans, the drum machines/filtered drums don't bother me, but since 'Eliminator,' 'Fandango!,' 'Rio Grande Mud,' 'ZZ Top's First Album' and 'Tres Hombres' have been remastered, why not reissue the other two albums? It's only logical!    Overall, if you don't own 'Eliminator' and you want to get it, hands down, buy the collector's edition. The bonus DVD and the exceptional remastering job make it worth the entire price of admission.    Highly recommended for any ZZ Top fan. The music is five stars, and so is the music. ZZ Top are the greatest band to come out of Texas, and anything less than five stars is criminal in my books. Closing statement: REISSUE 'EL LOCO' AND 'TEJAS' ALREADY!!!    ENJOY!!!
B0019T9FL6|2.0|The long-awaited debut is a huge letdown. The voice is still powerful, but harnessed to mediocre songs. Jennifer needs to go and listen to debuts from Aretha Franklin,Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand and hear what an exciting debut sounds like. These artists created distinct musical personalities and an amazing listening experience. This album is flat and makes me appreciate Jordin Spark's debut all the more.

B0019T9FL6|3.0|Jennifer Hudson blew moviegoers away with her movie debut, \\"Dreamgirls.\\"  What astounded them most was her powerful alto singing voice.  Couple that with the fact that she played the role of Effie White to perfection, and never wonder why she held everyone's attention.  It also doesn't hurt that she seems to be a down-to-earth and sincere individual.  If you want to know what makes me say that, check out her blogs, home videos and interviews.  However, never mistake her for a pushover, because she can be frank.  For example, Jennifer Holiday said something smart about the fact that Hudson redid the song \\"And I Am Telling You\\" and Hudson gave Holiday a piece of her mind in a magazine.<br /><br /> \\"Spotlight\\" is one of the standout songs of 2008, make no mistake about it.  The song has the Neyo signature sound (he wrote and produced the hit song) and Hudson really did a magnificent job.  As for the album, I was a disappointed with it as a whole.  There are highlights and memorable moments, but, really, they are the songs that were released to radio, mostly.  This album has its share of bland moments.  Some people will lose interest by the middle of the disc.  Jennifer's voice shines on each and every track, though.  She is an effortless talent and she makes that obvious to anyone who observes her.  Fantasia, T-Pain and Ludacris all make guest appearances.  I was gleaming with excitement when I heard Hudson and Fantasia singing together.  What a nice move!  The song, \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" mimics \\"The Boy is Mine\\" by Brandy and Monica and \\"Same Script, Different Cast\\" by Whitney Houston and Deborah Cox because all three songs feature two R&B singers and in each song the women are fighting over men.  It's a concept that is being recycled, but, personally, I am entertained by it.  The ladies do a great job together and it is one of the better songs on the album.  \\"We Gon' Fight\\" is another standout.  The hook and beat are nice; you'll be replaying this one if you invest in this album.  \\"Pocketbook\\" features Ludacris.  The two of them sound so nice together.  This song uses what made Doug E. Fresh famous, a technique called beatboxing.  I'm glad she stepped outside of her box and did this because it is a good song, namely the chorus.<br /><br /> Jennifer Hudson's voice is sometimes way too strong for R&B.  Her niche would no doubt be gospel music.  However, a lot of her songs are good.  I granted this album 3.5 stars because it is pretty enjoyable, but it is not something I will be listening to on a frequent basis.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Spotlight\\"<br />2. \\"And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going)\\"<br />3. \\"We Gon' Fight\\"<br />4. \\"Pocketbook\\"<br />5. \\"I'm His Only Woman\\"album.  \\"Pocketbook\\" features Ludacris.

B0000VCZKM|1.0|I don't have much to comment on this item as i could not view it. When I put it in the DVD player it asks you to check your area code. There is no area code for you to check, so therefor I cannot view the film.    My children were very dissappointed when they could not watch it and it was a waste of money buying it and having it shipped over,
B000MTPANQ|5.0|The disc is outstanding, marvelous live album, the sound is wonderful, the concert is an intimate setting.  The whole disc puts a smile on my face while I listen.  A must have in any collection.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a better book than the kite runner in my opinion. The pages exude genuine feeling...it is amazing how the author captures the full sentiments of betrayal with his candid descriptions. This is the heartbreaking tale of two women, both struggling to find their way in a world that seems bent on caging them in. Despite the odds, they manage to find their escape from hardship in their mutual friendship. Beautiful... a must read!
B00004YA0T|5.0|The words of praise I have about this set are innumerable.  It was my first Bruckner cycle...I grew up with it.  It accompanied me in all my times...and it changed my life.<br /><br />Jochum completely understands Bruckner, and his love for him shines out of every Symphony in this incredible set.<br /><br />Here's a few things of why I think Jochum's 2nd set surpasses all others:<br /><br />1) His answering to Bruckner's many spiritual questions.<br />2) His searching and quest like feeling he brings to the music.<br />3) The meaning, weight and believablility he gives to Bruckner's vision.<br />4) The consistency of dedication throughout all of the symphonies.<br />5) The recorded sound is warm, clear and sumptuous.<br />6) The orchestral playing shines splendorously throughout.<br />7) It seems from the magic aura these recordings have, that it wasn't just Jochum who loved Bruckner but also the players, the engineers and even the producers who all worked on this production.<br /><br />I set this bar above Karajan's recording, Celibidache's, Haitink's, Masur's, Chailly's, Wand's, Eichhorn's, Skrowaczewski's, Furtwangler's, Knappertsbush's, and also Jochum's first set.<br /><br />A MUST in all households!
B001CLG6RC|4.0|I've seen several other people make good points so I'll not be redundant.  I put this on par with, though definitely distint from, A Posteriori and both of these as better than Voyageur.  If you're already an Enigma fan, this is a strong release, except one thing...  What is that awful sound in Hell's Heaven that sounds like a telephone throwing up!?  I would really like that song, and have given this entire CD five stars, had it not been for that jarring, fingernail-pulling-off sound.
0375826726|2.0|Both my wife and I were excited to get this book... so much so that my wife re-read both of the first two books a few days before this one came out, and we purchased it the first time we saw it for sale at a store.  But now it has been almost a week since we purchased the book and neither of us is even halfway through it (and we are each becoming less interested by the day).  The book has sooooo much useless dialog, and moves along soooo slowly that reading it is almost a chore to do.  About once every 150 pages you will find something slightly interesting.    I will eventually finish the book, but it is not something that I will ever re-read.  Book 4 had better be worth the read... I am tired of the sagas that last forever, never go anywhere, and never end (Seventh Son, Wheel of Time, etc.).
B0010X745K|5.0|I love this movie based on the short story from Stephen King. I didn't expect much from \\"The Mist\\" since nearly all Mr.King's works had turned into bombs upon bombs, but fortunately, there are a few good and really excellent ones too.<br /><br /> Still, the interpretation of the amazing written works of Stephen King were not justified whenever they're turned in either a couple of miniseries,a-made-for-tv movies and movies to satisfy the cravings of the cinemagoers.<br /><br />  With \\"The Mist\\" the characters and plot blended so well that I can even forgive the half-hearted CGI that is being done on the many creatures. What makes this film one of the greatest in its genre is the ending. I'm so surprised and shocked with its ending.<br /><br />  You don't know whether you wanted to jump with joy that help is just a couple of minutes away, or to cry out loud and be so mad at the higher people who did this catastrophe. *It's so right and wrong at the same time, when this film ends, it kept popping back in my head and makes me think about the last scene that gave such an impact to my humane senses. I still think about it, but I like this gem of a film.<br /><br />  It is simple straightforward story without any of those pretentiousnes. The characters are real and believable. The plot is top notch. Humbly, recommended!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|My all-time favorite movie series. I started with vhs format to dvd and now on Blu-Ray. It makes viewing the best you could ask for.  Duvall & Jones paired together in this series have no equal. The closet second would be Duvall & Costner in Open Range.
B0013HA838|5.0|A wonderful performance, imaginatively staged (which is far from always true in this day of Eurotrash, or even of Covent Garden, as witness the ridiculously staged Falstaff they put out a few years ago with the splendid Bryn Terfel). Why it was necessary to move Figaro's action from the late 18th century to the early 19th, I don't quite know, but it does the piece no harm. Figaro, the Count, Cherubino and particularly Susanna (Miah Persson, the center of the opera, virtually always in control) are all terrific, and the Countess just a tiny notch below them. The only egregious piece of miscasting is Barbarina, who's both visibly older and larger than her paramour, but her role is pretty small, after all. David McVicar, the producer, pays tribute in his notes to Nicholas Till's wonderful book, Mozart and the Enlightenment, which conceives of this opera in terms the far transcend the usual conception of an Upstairs-Downstairs piece of class warfare.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|Deep Purples last with Coverdale & Hughes was probably not popular with<br />die hards but is still one of the best. With Tommy Bolin on guitar this<br />has more funky/blues & slow numbers but still rocks. Its worth a listen<br />just for the classics Gettin' Tighter, This Time Around & You Keep on<br />Moving which is one of my favorites. The band still plays great & this<br />music should not be dismissed. I'm sure fans of Coverdale & Hughes love<br />this as I do! It's a must for any fan of all!
B001CTA1T8|4.0|Cosmetics entrepreneur Vivian Ashe (Jamie Lee Curtis) lives a lavished lifestyle.  She makes sure her Chihuahua Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore) lives that same lifestyle with designer doggy outfits and diamond encrusted collars.  But, business calls for Viv to go overseas and unfortunately that means Chloe has to stay behind with Vivian's somewhat irresponsible niece Rachel (Piper Perabo).  Rachel decides to take a trip of her own, to Mexico, and Chloe gets dragged along.  A rather unfortunate \\"dog knapping\\" leads to a series of unfortunate events and the long way home with some comedic twists thrown in.    \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is an updated version of \\"Homeward Bound\\" with a Mexican twist.  It also has a bit of canine cop and a doggy love story thrown in.  The humor can be aimed at an adult audience (depending how you interpret some scenes), but overall the laughter is kid friendly.  Also to take note, the film contains some child oriented themes...don't give up on yourself and keep your promises.    \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is a fun movie to be enjoyed by all, especially those who fancy their dogs in attire.  Cute pooches and plenty of laughter make this a good family fun movie.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Marilyn Manson puts out good albums, the guitar riffs are catchy, lyrics are awesome and the guy has a great voice for this type of music.  The mid-nineties was the last great hurrah for heavy metal/rock and roll thanks to guys like Marilyn Manson and Smashing Pumpkins.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Right from the start- this is way better than the Crusade, which was good but did not blow my mind like Ascendancy did. Take thrash metal, hardcore, death metal, classic heavy metal and a tinge of progressive rock/metal mixed in with even a smaller one of alternative rock/country and throw it into a cauldron. Allow it to melt, creating a bubbling molten lava of steel. Take Trivium's all 3 past records and throw them into the cauldron. Stir vigorously. Take Metallica's, Megadeth's, Machine Head's and Iron Maiden's best elements and add to the mixture. Hint: you will NOT need any Killswitch Engage this time around. Allow it to simmer and sit until cold and solid. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve best cold.<br /><br />What separates this record from the Trivium's past is the incredible variety in tracks themselves. Granted, you can still hear the same band in all 11 songs (no instrumentals this time), but you are given something else to munch on in every one. Moreover, the album FEELS like an epic, conceptual piece. Some people have complained that it starts off like one of Metallica's classic records- with an acoustic segment, but this is done for the purpose of continuity with the last track on the album. The intro to \\"Kirisute  Gomen\\" is the main melody from the title track \\"Shogun\\". If there's any comparison, I would say Machine Head's \\"The Blackening\\" uses the same motive and it is no coincidence, because that album had a huge influence on \\"Shogun\\". From the first minute, then, you are treated to a variety of sounds and influences, Matt Heafy switching seamlessly between his clean vocals of Crusade, clean vocals of Ascendancy, his \\"screams\\" of Ascendancy and a new style, a brutal death metal growl that would not be out of place on a Malevolent Creation record. Just listen to the mid-break in insurrection- pure sulphur! This is another interesting thing about the new Trivium- every song has radio friendly and even rock parts to it, but they are encased in a heavy - as - Godzilla's - balls mixture of death/thrash core wall of sound. The riffs and melodies on this album are simply top notch, the band exceeding themselves creatively and in performance. Every member of Trivium gave it all on this one and it shows. The catchy parts are so hummable, they will torture you with earworms for all eternity, and the solos rival the best of 80's thrash/death metal. Matt Heafy has evolved from a mediocre sound-like everybody else-in metalcore vocalist to one of the best and most versatile in metal. His clean vocal performance is top notch and his growls are brutal as brutality itself. What Matt does vocally on this album just has to be heard to be believed.  Finally, Matt has written the best lyrics of any Trivium record.<br /><br />Since all the songs get 5/5 from me, individual rating would have been redundant. Onto the songs, a brief description of the best elements in each:<br />1. \\"Kirisute Gomen\\".<br />This is both Crusade and Ascendancy sounding song. The best moments are mid-song melodic chorus/break and the harmonies of the bridge, and of course, lyrics (\\"...I'll take their f@#$ing head!\\") Another new element is the brutal, low tuned guitar sound, which reminds me of Hypocrisy.<br />2. \\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\\"<br />My personal favorite track of the album, it has amazing guitarwork, if slightly on the progressive side, two choruses, one mid-paced and one slow, amazing bass solo worthy of Cliff Burton in the mid-part and this song is the most varied and complex, except for the title track.<br />3. \\"Down from the Sky\\"<br />This is the video-single, a good video, in my opinion. As for the song, it is one of the outstanding tracks on the record, it features the opening country/metal? riff, that ultra-brutal death metal growl from Matt, great bridge before the chorus which is also very addictive. Great musicianship, overall.<br />4. \\"Into the Mouth of Hell We March\\"<br />I told my friend Chris, if you don't like this song, youdon't like metal, man. This just a pure melodic thrashfest reminiscent of Rust in Peace/Countdown to Extinction Megadeth and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" Iron Maiden. My second favorite.<br />5. \\"Throes of Perdition\\"<br />This one will no doubt polarize many with its super-radio friendly chorus which sounds like...Nickelback. Even Matt sounds like Chad Croeger on this one, on purpose, I think. But that is not all that is to it. The song also features ultra-brutal guitar breakdowns and riffs with that Hypocrisy sound. So even if you want to put this on the radio, the teenagers will still freak out over the \\"scary man growling over the sounds of the construction site\\" or something like that. I like this song, it's different, it's still Trivium and it shows that they are capable of much more than thrash/metal core. And, of course, everything is superbly executed here and that friendly chorus WILL haunt you.<br />6. \\"Insurrection\\"<br />Thrash metal at its finest. This would not have been out of place on the Crusade, but it's way better than that record. There is a lot of \\"Embers to Inferno\\" on it, too. The mid part, as I have mentioned earlier, has that ultra-brutal Malevolent Creation death metal break. Brutal.<br />7. \\"The Calamity\\"<br />Another example of Crusade done better, mixed in with \\"Embers...\\" this reminds me of \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" Megadeth. It has an absolutely addictive, superb melody in the chorus. Matt soars vocally and gutarwise.<br />8. \\"He Who Spawned the Furies\\"<br />Another weird one. This has been influenced by Opeth and doom metal. Different than the rest, which to me, is a plus. I don't like to hear one song and then 10 worse versions of the same on the record (cough, new All That Remains, cough)<br />9. \\"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\\"<br />This ties in with track 2 for my favorite track on the album. Spectacular, highly original, and the best chorus on the record with superb melody and guitars. Matt exceeds his own ability as vocalist, and I mean the clean vocals. He is one of the best in the biz, now. Awesome, simply, awesome.<br />10. \\"Like Calisto to a Star in Heaven\\"<br />More melodic bliss. It builds up on the last song but stands on its own. Uses some weird spoken vocals in the middle. Some thrash crescendos in between, reminiscent, again, of Trivium's first album.<br />11. \\"Shogun\\"<br />The crown jewel of \\"Shogun\\". 11 minutes of unbelievable musicianship and vocal prowess. It has all the best elements of Trivium, and serves as a summary to all we have heard on this album. It is Trivium's most ambitious, most creative song to date. Heavily influenced by \\"The Burning Red\\" Machine Head as well as MH last album. And then, Matt breaks into this Hetfield-sound-alike ballad-like vocal line that sounds like \\"Load\\"! It sounds so eerie, as though Hetfield actually guest singing on the record! But, like with imitation of Chad Croeger's earlier, I believe Matt has done it for fun, and I appreciate his sense of humor in this matter. And it fits songs perfectly. It ends like \\"Embers to Inferno\\" with a mournful, melodic riff, at a slightly faster pace. Ladies and gentlemen you have just heard the album of the year 2008.<br /><br />When I reviewed \\"The Crusade\\", I was very disappointed with it, but I expressed my hope (the same reserved for the next All that Remains record now) that Trivium will recover from that setback. I am happy to announce that they have not only met, but far exceeded my expectations for their new music. Personally, I thought they would never top excellent \\"Ascendancy\\". I was wrong. They have easily done that, while, in my opinion, totally burying the legend of Metallicas and Megadeths of the world (most certainly those of recent, at least). Why? Because they did not try to sound like them but better, they decided to stick to what makes them sound best-like Trivium.<br /><br />Now this is what happens when an incredibly talented band swallows their pride, recovers and learns from their good butnot great last recording (The Crusade), looks back to the best of their creative past (Ascendancy, Embers to Inferno), abandons their insane sound-alike contest with Metallica (without shaking off all the healthy influence), allows appropriate time between last record and a new one (over 2 years, unlike barely a year between  Ascendancy and the Crusade), incorporates all the best elements of their past records, combines their sound with experimentation not only from metal, and, in the end, creates their masterpiece. It is a work complete, not one note too much or too little, a quintessence of a band's over 5 years in music business/art. Shogun is a record that even Trivium themselves will have a hard time topping. This is how modern metal should evolve, drawing from other genres while still staying, essentially, metal. Otherwise, it becomes stale and a parody of itself. I am aware that we have yet to hear the new Unearth, God Forbid and Omnium Gatherum records, but for me, \\"Shogun\\" is easily a contender for the album of the year as of now. And Matt Heafy IS the Chuck Shuldiner (Death) of the 21 century, period.0. \\"Like Calisto to a Star in Heaven\\"   More melodic bliss. It builds up on the last song but stands on its own.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes' debut full length album is a pleasant, folksy good time. It doesn't really reach the heights that some more intense bands do, but the combination of good acoustic guitar work, alternately catchy and haunting vocal harmonies, and unique song structures make for a record really worth listening too.  The hippie-looking Robin Pecknold is probably the band's driving force, writing all the lyrics and taking charge with the vocals, but you get the feeling they just like playing together as a group and working together to create one memorable sound.  I had heard that this album was one of the year's best indie releases, and decided to check the video for \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" on Youtube.  I was a bit surprised by what I was hearing, because it doesn't sound like something from this year at all, but still captivated by it, and I shortly found out that this same thought carried throughout each of the tracks.    From the near prog-like constant shift in pace of \\"Sun it Rises\\" to the solitary howling at the end of \\"Oliver James\\", every song does something unique while still fitting the band's central feeling.  I almost feel like I've heard some of these before, and I'm sure that's partly because it's hard to come up with unique music these days, but that quality of familiarity is part of its appeal to me.  It's hard to really describe what makes each song good, because it's never a single hook or element, it's always the sum of the parts.  Some favorites are \\"Ragged Wood\\", \\"Quite Houses\\", \\"Your Protector\\", and \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\".  It's really one of those albums that has to be listened to as one experience and not a bunch of disparate tracks to throw on your iPod's shuffle.  Although \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" is still pretty awesome by itself.
B001CC7PN0|5.0|A different type of Cinderella story. Although many times the wording used in the film was too American 20th century it was a good clean romantic film.<br />Drew Barrymore shined brightly for a change.
B0002SROSQ|3.0|Abattoir Blues / Lyre of Orpheus being Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds 2004 release and the first since the departure of Blixa Bergald whom left the group to foucus all his attention on his mani project/group Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten. This is a quite good record. However, if one compares this to their magnum opus, i.e., Let Love In, then it is not as good. One problem is that for some reason he has included a little too blues influenced sound. I like blues alright, but it is definitely not my favorite genre. Still and all, this is a quite good record that has some fine tracks, for instance Messiah Ward and The Lyre of Orpheus.
B0015FML06|5.0|I was about 14 when I first saw this on a friends Hi-Fi system about a year after it came out. Until that day I didn't care much about Rock music. This was unlike anything I had ever seen or heard and it blew me away. It's about time they put it on DVD.
B000003Z4C|5.0|Let Love In was Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds 1994 and it sure is a dandy of a release. In fact, I would have to say that it is their best record so far. There are so many amazing tracks that I astounded by the quality. It starts out with the haunting track \\"Do you love me?\\". After this we get the solemn and sad track \\"Nodbody's Baby Now\\". Loverman follows with it is twisted lyrics and frantic singing. Jangling Jack is a track that I did not like at first. However, it is a track that grows on you and not being a favorite but I still enjoy it. As you can easily see from just these first tracks this is truly a gem. Nick Cave is such a good lyricist and he sings about love it does not trite but sincere. Red Right Hand tells the story of a demented man with a red right hand. Let Love In tells about the darker side of love. The thirsty dog is a song about remorse and I must up until I was not so wild about it. However, tonight I finally understand the lyrics. Ain't gonna rain anymore is a heart wrenching song about lost love. Lay me low is such a hillarious and twisted song about about a fictious funeral and it really spins out of control. Then this amazing record's last track is Do you Love me? (Part 2). This is one of the best records that I have ever listened to and I would recommend it to anyone that likes quality music with witty, inteligent and insight full lyrics!
B001GAPC1K|4.0|First off, I was not disappointed when I saw this movie in the theaters.  Pretty good story arc, believable characters.  A little slow at times, reminded me of Superman Returns,  The problem I have with my purchase is I was expecting to be bowled out of my chair by the audio.  Compared to the audio effects and low-end bass found in Transformers, Iron Man was kind of a let down (use of all channels was fine/transfer was nice)  The scene where Stark demos the Jericho was a major disappointment (had to crank my receiver).  Anyway, as a whole the movie was fine, but I think people should rent it first, not only because of the known issues with compatibility, but simply to make sure this is a movie you'll watch again.  I'm fairly certain that now that I've seen it twice, I'll be skipping through the slow areas.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|The first time I watched Tootsie was when I was 12 years old, heard this Stephen Bishop song on the TV, and surprised to see an oldmaid clutching a baby and looking admiringly at the baby's mom. The song seems out of place....  [After I finished that second half of the movie, I rewound the Betamax tape--my brother had already watched it full--and re-play the whole thing just for me.]     But later, how Dustin Hoffman made me believe he was a legitimate old lady in heavy makeup, in love with Jessica Lange but cant express it, was amazing.     This is one of the first movie that demonstrated great acting to me. Even Sydney Pollack's (the director himself) banters with Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels are remarkably funny, something that many other movies has imitated afterwards.     It's a comedy, yes, but it also touched on unemployment, single parenthood, struggling for art and principle, how tv soaps are made,... what more can you ask more of a movie? Strong script, great actors, fantastic direction, good song...    The I Might Be You song has since become one of the quintessential wedding songs ever, but everytime Im hearing it in FM, it always reminds me of a man who cant express his love because he's disguised in drag out of necessity. What a combination, but it worked.     This DVD has no interesting special features whatsoever. But I dont need any thing more to give it 5 stars.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This CD, I am tempted to say, is some of the best I've heard in a long while.  I loved Ascendancy, and respected Crusade, and now Trivium has figured out how to combine the best of the two styles.  It has the metalcore aspects I missed from The Crusade, and has a nice mix of screaming and singing (from Crusade).  Buy this album!  You won't be disappointed.
B0019X3YXM|2.0|I thought from the trailer it would not be that bad, but after watching the korean version, it did not even come near it.  The acting wasn't that bad, but I guess i do not like remakes.  But this just my opinion anyway.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|This is my first Blu-Ray purchase and I couldn't be more pleased.  This is one of my favorite films, even though I only had it on Laser Disc before this.  Will watch this many more times!
0307265730|5.0|I read the first story in this collection with a lump in my throat.  The way Lahiri describes her characters and their stories is so simple, yet so incredibly heart wrenching that I found myself aching along with the characters.  Her writing is amazingly simple, no overwrought descriptions or tediousness, but I just found myself gliding into her characters' lives and feeling all the emotions:  the loss of loved ones, sadness, isolation and hope.  I think her stories are so universal that everyone can find something to relate to.  Read this book--you will not be disappointed.  The stories and emotions will linger long after you put it down.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Each season of Supernatural is somehow better than the last. Season three is truly incredible, with the scripts and acting being absolutely mind-blowing. Just when you think it can't get any better, it totally blows you away.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This calculator is very advanced, it has more functions than I know what to do with. The 12c calculator is smaller and has more features than the BA-II. It also comes with a cool carrying case.
B000WC4A8O|5.0|The mothership is as grand as its' title.  Amazing packaging, has a colorful booklet that let's a fan into the world of Led Zeppelin, and all the vinyls sound epic.  Each song in the collection is a classic for both the average fan and a true fan.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|The song writing is worse than St. Anger and the production quality is slightly better.  Lars needs to learn to tune his snare drum.  The lyrics are corny, as if someone told Hetfield to write something \\"angry and metal sounding.\\"      Overall, a huge disappointment.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I love this show soo much... My boyfriend and I pop the dvd in and \\"tele-binge\\" whenever we have a long afternoon to do so.  I love Neil Patrick Harris's character, Barney (Swarley, you'll see why I say that in Season 2), he's my fave!! I love how they flashback at stuff and the characters are in college again getting high and being stupid!! I highly recommend this show for anyone who needs a seriously funny show with a wonderful cast!!
B000P46QTA|5.0|This movie deserves the oscar! This is a character study on the level of \\"The Conversation\\" Like some of the reviews say, the movie does take a while to get going but it's suppose to be that way. Others have criticized the subtitles - not a problem, the acting is so well done you can read the actors faces and body language and you know what's going on. As for the realism - I don't know - but I think it makes for a great movie!! If you love movies this is a must see.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Being Marvel Studios' first self-financed film, Iron Man is a pure treat from start to finish.  I won't bother going into the storyline, since most already know it by now considering how smashing a success the film proved to be at the box-office, but it does go without saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel film to see the light of day, outshined only by X2: X-Men United.  Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.  It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.  As a superhero film, Iron Man is definitely close to the top (but nowhere near The Dark Knight, which takes the notion of the superhero movie and turns it on it's head), with the only drawback for me personally being that I just couldn't get into Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.  I don't know what it is, I jsut don't find him all that well-casted as Rhodes as I do everyone else in the film.  Still though, Iron Man is a pure blast for nearly it's entire running time, and here's hoping that Favreau, Downey, and co. can keep the magic coming.
B00005JPY0|5.0|I saw The Dark Knight in theaters when it came out in July.  I loved it!  What I want to know is given that the street release date of December 9th was announced over a week ago, why is this film still not available for pre-order?
0446310786|5.0|it was all great the shipping was fast the price was just right loved it
B0002TJGQS|5.0|They appear to be legitimate Maxell batteries. They are working great for the device I put them in and I am very satisfied. I bought them from Best Price Mirror and the delivery time was about 3-4 days via USPS, I think. They are selling them dirt cheap so the $4 shipping fee is probably used to boost their profit. Still, that makes the cost less than $1 per battery. Which is really good for these batteries.
0312427999|5.0|This is great service, it is sent immidiately after placing an order. It take a few days, I can read a book.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Where Clint's production of the best-selling book by James Bradley about the Iwo Jima fight came off as slightly disappointing, his retelling of the battle from the doomed Japanese soldier's point of view is brilliant. I normally do not like subtitles, but here the story is so interesting that the titles are just a minor annoyance. This one deserves the honors it brought to Eastwood, and to the major actors in it. The emotional wallop here is what eluded Eastwood when he recreated the American side of the month-long fight on that island in 1945. If you care about World War II, this is a \\"must see.\\" If you hate the Japanese for the cruelty of their troops, and for their stubborn refusal to surrender even when battle outcomes were obvious, this film explains their reasoning. It will not convert you to their side, of course, but it does humanize their patriots. Watch both \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" in the same week, and you will be a graduate of a mini-course in the psychology and horrors of war from two different major world cultures.
B000LV63SQ|3.0|This album is by no means a \\"must have.\\"  There are one or two great songs, namely \\"Annie.\\"  There are also some pretty good songs.  However, much of the album is forgettable.  This may be surprising to Who fans, but Pete Townsend's efforts pale in comparrison to Ronnie Lane's.  If you are a Townsend fan, stick to his Who albums.  If you're a Ronnie Lane fan, you are buying five good songs.
B000001XN2|4.0|I originally had this as 5 stars, but then I recalled that the album came without a libretto, so I knocked off 1/2 star. While I am not usually a fan of Karajan's conducting, I thought he moved things along crisply, so no deductions there. But opera's about singing, and this one has Franco Corelli and Leontyne Price, two of the most exciting singers of their era or any other. Add Giulietta Simionato and Ettore Bastianini to the mix and you have over two hours of glorious sound.
B001AW9DKK|1.0|It is these naive baby boomers that have ruined our country. Neil's only live backup band is Crazy Horse. Period. These are the first people to die when the radical Muslims take over. So, yea, lets fight them over here, especially after Barry takes our guns.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|Voyager was Enigma's most underrated CD.  I challenge anyone who claims to not like it to turn the lights off, turn the music up loud, and pour a glass of red wine (or your preferred equivalent :))    This is a great CD-Vocal songs are much more hard hitting that A Posteriori-it is great that Andru Donalds is back in classic form.  He literally carries the 2nd song (Seven Lives).  Much more MUSIC and much less space than A Posteriori-with especially hard hitting vocals on   The Same Parents and  Distorted Love.     Great instrumentation throughout-a return to more classical elements, but with minimal Gegorian chant, which is fine.  If I want more, I listen to MCMXC A.D.    As with Voyager-if you say you don't like it-you need to turn off the lights and turn the volume up.  This is easily in Enigma's top three CDs.    I am thankful that it IS different than early Enigma.  Artists that don't expand seem to go away and I want Michael Cretu to be around for a while.
B00005JPSM|5.0|From director Scott Hicks comes a sweet story about love, loss and fire in the kitchen. \\"No Reservations\\" starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin is a family version of the FOX TV hit \\"Hell's Kitchen.\\" I half expected Chef Ramsay to come out and begin cussing everyone out. I loved this tender romance film. Coincidence that I saw this movie a week or two before \\"Waitress,\\" a similarly-themed movie? I don't think so. While \\"Waitress\\" had some rougher language, this movie has a mild use of \\"Hell.\\" The scene where Nick was singing \\"Nessun Dorma\\" from Giacomo Puccini's final (and unfinished) opera \\"Turandot\\" brought back vague memories for me. Great film. Rated PG for thematic elements.
031606792X|2.0|This book broke my heart. This author had an amazing trio of books that preceded this book, but simply failed completely to deliver a fitting conclusion to the series. She truly missed several opportunities to take these characters through greater experiences. The three prior books made a point of stressing the fact that there are consequences to our choices, yet Bella never had to face any consequences or solve any real problems of her own. The Merchant of Venice reference in the 4th book never went anywhere, and could have been a great feature of the story. Also, I believe the book \\"jumped the shark\\" with the birth of Renesme. I almost need a 5th book to get the taste of this book out of my mouth.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I got cd for the song the Beast and the Harlot. That one songs rocks! Everthing else sound like soloest at boy's choir backed by a metal band. After a few listens is starts sounding the same. I am sure that the emo kids dig it. As metal head that I am I have heard better. Like the Priest, 3 Inches of Blood, or even Lillian Axe. If you are into real metal, I would pass this one by. As the saying gose NO FALSE METAL!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I got hooked on this series recently.  I have now seen all 5 seasons that are available on DVD.  I thought I was hooked on CSI Las Vegas.  But this is just as good, at least in my opinion.
0143038419|4.0|I enjoyed reading Ms. Gilbert's account of her travels and experiences. She writes really well and is very entertaining. However, I found the extremes she went through to quell her emotional pain and find her center well outside of the \\"norm\\" (I mean how many of us can take a year off to travel the world because we've had a divorce or breakup with a significant other?) and a little ridiculous for a grown women if you ask me, but to each his/her own, I guess. If you're not looking for anything too spiritual or enlightening, this is a good read. Just hearing about all of the customs and characters is fasinating. If it were a movie, it would definitely be a \\"Chick Flick.\\"
B0000C9JFO|5.0|.. or should I say young adult matures his attitude about what is important in life. I really liked this movie. If Amelie is a 99 and Tall Blond Man is a 98 then I give this a 97, almost perfect. Film buffs will see where the director has used things he learned from others but nothing is distracting and it's a great little story.
B0015AARJI|4.0|The saying 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' would have been a fair response when deciding what to do with the next gen Playstation controller, and Sony seems to have agreed for the most part. The PS2 Dual Shock controller was easily the best design of any of its competitors. Unfortunately, Microsoft's mild tweaks to the Xbox controller were brilliant, and Sony's few additions were useless except for the wireless capability, and it even took them a while to get around to bringing back the rumble feature.<br /><br />Microsoft smartly resisted overhauling their controller and recognized how to perfect the basic design by downsizing, rounding off some hard edges, and moving the black and white buttons as well-sized, nimbly responsive shoulder buttons. The PS3 controller is still a fine controller, and the best one for the Playstation, but Microsoft stepped out of character and actually made a brilliantly improved product (along with the Xbox itself) that now has, to my mind, taken the throne as best designed controller.<br /><br />This controller coupled with a nice rubbery silicon covering for it makes it the perfect controller for the PS3, just avoid the Six-axis use whenver you can -- more gimmick than benefit.
B001AIRUP4|4.0|Our family has had a copy of this movie on some format or other for a long time, so it was a natural addition to our Blu-ray collection.  The high definition is great for this film because it lets you see the detail of the models so much better.    It's also our first experience with the digital copy feature, which I like because the kids can run the movie on the PC without having to fire up the home theatre or handle the disk.    My interest in Danny Elfman's music predates his film scoring career, so I found it fascinating how he worked with Tim Burton to get the songs written before a script actually existed.  It's my favorite portion of the bonus features.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I was unable to catch Iron Man in the theatre during the summer and so I was waiting for this on Blu-ray quite anxiously. I was pretty confident that it would be good picture and sound as Marvel has yet to make a disappointing Blu release, but I was blown away by Iron Man! This is the definition of a reference disc! Flawless 1080P picture, lossless audio that lets you hear every little nuance of sound from the explosions in Afghanistan, to the ice freezing to the Mark II suit on its first flight. If you want the true theatre-at-home experience, this disc will definitely bring it to you!    Downey is a great actor and a great portrayal of the troubled Stark, he comes off as a complete natural throughout the whole film. The supporting roles are all filled by extremely talented cast and that is what sets this movie aside from previous Marvel films like the Spiderman films or HULK, which rely too much on the superhero factor and don't seem to worry too much about the cast.    Oh and this definitely is not a movie that should be limited to any specific audience as it is something I would watch with anyone from a little brother to a friend, my mother or grandmother, it is an enjoyable, reasonably realistic film for just about anyone.
B000UD08HW|5.0|I just recently purchased this video on Blu-Ray, and I have to say, it is fantastic.  I didn't actually expect the video quality to be that great, considering the fact that you need some pretty nice cameras to capture a very high definition picture.  I was partially right, and I think it has a great deal to do with the lighting.  Certain cameras at certain times with the right lighting look wonderful, where as other views of the concert look somewhat grainy.  The picture quality is still great, and the lighting effects are mind blowing.   With that said, I will now mention what I believe to be the most amazing part about this video, the audio.  I can't speak for the DVD version, but the Blu Ray version has crystal clear audio.  It literally sounds as if you are sitting in the audience, or maybe even better.  Great picture and amazing audio would be worthless if the music itself wasn't also great, and it is.  Some tracks worth noting: \\"Echoes\\" \\"Shine on you Crazy Diamond\\" \\"Comfortably Numb\\" \\"High Hopes\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life\\".  If you are a Pink Floyd fan, I cannot see how you could be disappointed with any of these songs.  Seeing Rick Wright do his thing on the keyboards, with such delicate perfection, smiling the entire time, makes this video worth purchasing alone.  I cannot recommend this video more, if you are considering buying it, I suggest to stop thinking, and buy it now.  If you have a high def output and surround sound, you are in for an unbelievable treat.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|amazing family classic. The video and audio are top notch and although it might lack some extras the digital copy is a nice touch. Highly recommended
1592533868|3.0|[[ASIN:1592533868 Art of Paper Quilling: Designing Handcrafted Gifts and Cards]] A beginner could use this book as it has basic instructions for most  of the techniques. What I like about the book is it covers a wide variety of quilled pieces from cards to boxes. It also has a newer technique for hand fringed flowers. The pictures of the finished designs and the techniques are large and clear. It is a nice addition to a paper quilling library.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|Great commentary by the director and producer in the special features section.  This movie is a cult classic!
1847245455|3.0|I think the problem with this novel, which other reviewers have ably summarised, is that it is an artificial construct.<br /><br />I mean, I didn't find the story boring, tne number of characters excessive or the plot (there are in fact two; which is the main one in human terms, possible future reader?) difficult to follow, as other negative revs have. On the contrary, for me the narration flowed agreeably, the twists were unexpected, and the book didn't pretend to be what it was not (a semibrow literary piece). But it, or rather its main characters, are implausible: cardboard, not flesh-and bone. At all times you're aware you're reading a story, not something that could have been real life. Here we revert to an Ellery Queen type of novel without its intellectual tease, which leaves ... nothing.<br />So the book is basically a kid's one (although full of episodes a real kid souldn't read), with heroes that are decent, loyal, intelligent, charming, truthful -one of them agonizes over a moral dilemma that could find a place in Lincoln's hagiography-, with liberal worldviews, etc.; with a convenient deus ex machina that finds out everything that's needed at the drop of a hat; with corrupt -and worse- financial tycoons/villains; with real dark, dark imperturbable villains with awful perversions and insatiable bloodlusts; and with a closing tirade about the evils of finance (for maximum impact the book should have been published after the current Wall Street turmoil) with words lifted almost straight out of Keynes.<br /><br />Perhaps I could summarise it all with three words: it's a politically correct book. Nothing against them, of course, and for that (and the research it inconspicuously packs) I give it three stars. But if you have read Lehane's \\"Gone, baby, gone\\" (a book less grisly by far, but that poses a real moral dilemma), you'll understand what I mean.
0385340990|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read this year. The characters are real; the humor is just right; the seriousness doesn't overwhelm.
B0018CWWLE|5.0|This was a great show!!  I caught it on MHD and just had to have it.  It is a very well recorded show. Dolby Digital and dts 5.1 are both offered.  I was a little spoiled by watching the performance in HD.  Overall, a nice package that I would recommend to any Genesis fan.  If this comes out on Blu-Ray, I'll be first in line!!    Cheers!
B00005JPO1|1.0|THIS is the movie Lucas, Spielberg and Ford were all excited to make??? We've come to expect this sort of childish nonsense from George Lucas, but Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford also thought this was a good idea??? This is an absolutely awful excuse for a movie much less an entry into the Indiana Jones canon.<br /><br />Fortunately for me I had the time of my life laughing at it's stupidity. I was in tears for most of the whole film because I just couldn't believe how bad it all was and just when I thought what I had just seen was bad enough, something even more ridiculous happened.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Only a handful of guards at the US base protecting our most important secrets and artifacts, including the ARK!!!<br /><br />It seems we've all over-reacted to the threat of atomic bombs as you can just get inside a refrigerator at ground zero and survive it. Oh yeah, then you'll be able to get out of it instead of getting locked inside and dying like others have before.<br /><br />We also now know that boxers and MMA fighters are just a bunch of fragile weaklings because Indiana Jones took about a 1000 punches to the face and barely had a mark to show for it.<br /><br />Tarzan swinging??? Are they serious??? He catches up to 2 speeding vehicles doing it!!!<br /><br />The car scene, where it jumped off the cliff onto a branch and then they drove into the water??? Uh, yeah right.<br /><br />How about Dr. Jones and company going over not 1, not 2, but 3 WATER FALLS in a freakin military jeep and surviving without or scratch on them!!!<br /><br />Giant Ants??? Where do you find those?<br /><br />Mayans just waiting inside the walls to pop out and attack intruders. How did they get in there anyways???<br /><br />The skull was far too light to be crystal and looked like plastic filled with aluminum foil. Sure was easy to find too.<br /><br />Every time they get wet, five minutes later their clothes are dry, pressed and cleaned. How about some consistency here?<br /><br />And then the capper, it's all about........(drum roll)..........ALIENS!!! Yes, our standard, prototypical aliens with elongated heads and a flying saucer. E.T. go home indeed.<br /><br />And there you have it. Indiana Jones has gained superpowers over the years and an experienced, award winning director has managed to make a movie with all the ability of a 5th grader. Whatever drove Lucas to madness has spread to Spielberg. Somebody put a stop to it before other talented film makers turn out nonsense like this! Oh well, at least I didn't pay for it and I laughed harder and longer during this mess than anything in recent memory. Although, people usually want you to laugh with them, not at them. I hope that's enough for them. I'd still like my 2 hrs. back though.<br /><br />If you want to see 2 hrs. of what not to do in a movie and enjoy laughing at other peoples mistakes, go right ahead and check this out. But if you value your time, like the other Indiana Jones movies, quality films and consider yourself an intelligent person and like movie makers to treat you like you are, RUN, don't walk away from this movie. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the NUMB Skull.rd, prototypical aliens with elongated heads and a flying saucer. E.T. go home indeed.    And there you have it.

B000E6UWE4|5.0|...but well worth the effort.    \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" has to be one of the most confusing books I have ever read. However, if a person gives the series a chance, they will be pleasantly surprised. It has quickly become my favorite series of all time. The characters are unique, funny, heart-breaking, cold, soft-hearted, kind, and every other adjective a person could think of. I am now on the sixth book in the series, and loving it just as much as I loved the first five. There is no end to the creative \\"monsters\\" Erikson has created, and not once reading this series did I find myself saying, \\"I know who he copied that from!\\" The man is truly gifted.   Once you get through to book four, things magically start falling into place, and all of the work and concentration is well-rewarded. It is indeed a \\"hard\\" read, but it only takes getting used to. Don't give up, because it would be a sad loss for any true reader to miss such a vast, well-written, treasured story.

B00004RF9B|4.0|It's been more than twenty years since I've seen this movie and the remake is absolutely awesome. I watched the film with my 10 year old grandson and he said the film was great. He couldn't believe that the film was made over 50 years ago. The color and graphics were great and the audio was very good. I couldn't recommend a better movie for entertainment.
B00005JMK0|5.0|An angelic Virginia Madsen, a dorky Lenny von Dohlen and a fried pc formed one of the funnier and oddest of romantic threesomes. This \\"period piece\\" is full of obsolete and hilarious computer references, amazing 80's fashions and one of the more eclectic, fun soundtracks (along the line of the 'Footloose\\" soundtrack, if you were there, then you have heard the songs) from the era. The day that this movie comes out on DVD will be legen......wait for it.........dary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Until that bitchin' day arrives, check out the soundtrack. My teenage daughters listen to it more than a lot of today's \\"hits\\".
B00009W0U4|4.0|Its a fairly good movie. Runs from the end to the front in sections. It is a french movie with English subtitles. Has a realistic, brutal rap scene that is extremely disturbing. Affected me for 3 days.
B000005J56|5.0|this cd is amazing and would have been a shame if it was never put on a cd. Even if you don't know spanish, pick this cd up because it has an upbeat vibe to it. It's something that you can just put on the stereo and clean the house to, or listen on a road trip. Inside the cd you get a nice little booklet with info about the songs, artist, and the english translations to the songs along with pictures of the band. I highly suggest this cd to any music fan.
B001CT877Q|5.0|Great movie for Arnold. Vanessa did a great job as well. The Blu Ray transfer is Fantastic!!! A must for your collection.
1843106698|5.0|It has now been several months since reading Tony Attwood's excellent book and I have pulled it out to read again.  It provides invaluable insights into myself and many people that I know.      Tony's light-hearted approach keeps it readable.  As he says, he has discovered a means of removing almost all of the symptoms of Asperger's from a person.  Simply put that person in a room, by themselves, alone.  The symptoms have now disappeared.    When it comes time to understand what happens when other people are in the room with someone who has Asperger's Syndrome, then read this book.    Mike Mazzetti
B00007GZR5|5.0|I love this movie.  I have watched it countless of times.  If you believe in God and that life does not end after you pass over, see the movie.  Absolutely Beautiful.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I am a big fan of Coldplay anyway, but really enjoy their new CD, especially the title song, Viva La Vida. It makes me just want to get up and dance along with the music and I am an \\"older\\" fan so it probably isn't pretty when I do. :)  Coldplay's music is just so vibrant and has such an energy to it, that I love to listen to them!
0618918248|4.0|While he makes many good points, it seems like the book constantly comes back to Dawkins defending himself instead of attacking religion.  As an atheist I understand what its like to live in a religious world and be ridiculed and mocked for not believing in the supernatural, but Dawkins seems to take it a step too far.      I've also never seen someone quote themselves so often in one book.
0307269191|1.0|Like many people I love Murakami. I don't have 1 favorite. It can be Windup chronicles, Kafka on the shore, Dance dance dance or even Hard-boiled wonderland and the end of the world. Yet, if you do like Murakami like me and don't want to be disappointed. I strongly suggest you avoid this book. It's autobiographic and has nothing of that magic of his fictional books. The only reason to read this book is when you run like he runs. If you want to read about other people preparing for a marathon this book has some insights you want to know about. If you don't run long distances and just like literature in general and/or specifically Murakami avoid this book. Don't spoil your feelings/associations/recollections by reading this book. Preserve Murakami as you know him!
