B005KAH7QU|4.0|This was a good movie and I really enjoyed the action, though much of it was somewhat over the top.  Her training gave her a good heads up on her adversaries.  Plot was kinda thin but that's what you get with many of the action movies.  Still, it was fun to watch.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I never knew Adele exist , I herd 1 song of hers from this cd so I purchased it to my surprise I'm happy that I did.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|The trailers looked good, so I thought this would be a really interesting movie, even based on some sort of pandemic.  Brad Pitt is a good draw, so I thought this might be good.  Within the first 5-10 mins, I knew I was watching another stupid, dumb Zombie movie.  I cannot believe Brad Pitt succumed to playing a role in this movie.  Woody Harrelson in &#34;Zombieland&#34; was at least somewhat predictable, but this just sucked!!  I wasted $3.99 on this one.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is a fun new edition to the Star Wars Angry Birds family. I like the continuation of the Star Wars theme and my son who is a Star Wars fanatic - loves the take on the series. It was a little limited on stage - but it seems like they will be adding more soon. Hope so.
B0072NWJRK|1.0|As a  true crime fan, this is one of the most disappointing  buys I've read.  It dwells on politics, geography, places and  people that you would have to be very familiar with history to find interesting.  The actual crime takes a back seat to the aforementioned.  Characters are dull and there is much repitition.
0399226907|5.0|Invited to a baby christening I wasn't sure what to bring. I new the little guy would never want for clothes and money didn't seem right. So I bought the Melamine Dish set, the Hungry Caterpillar book and bean bag toy. Hit gift! have heard from mother how much he loves the set and from others that they too gave the gift (or similar) . Oh and the items are fantastic.

B00EABEHF4|5.0|Very helpful!!!! And a well written guide to the philiphines :-) Nice pictures too!!!!! Gets you excited about going there!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|As human beings you never think this could possibly happen, then go on living with this secret. Just try and imagine how a family would accept this tragety when discovered. I felt horrible for all  sides.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Great to see talented artists get together and create some a great album. I especially liked &#34;Don't Want Lies&#34;....excellent song.
B00190N4E4|3.0|Gandhi is a great movie. I feel as the movie gave out a lot of mini messages about how we need to really think about how we live today. Although the time and era of his movements were 1914, he had already done a lot in other countries. The movie was about Gandhi trying to overall make peace within his home land and the Brittan's. For he had already been to South Africa and England. So he was already trying to make things work at home too. The movie started out by him realizing how things at home are just not equal at, he felt by even simply wearing westernized clothes that his efforts In trying to change the thinking of others around him was not helping. So he decided to change first by his clothes. Stripping down to just a `cloth' and trying to get his message of equality across. He then asks many higher people to help him with getting independence from Brittan. He needed to also get all religions together in order to getting them their independence. It took a while for them to even realize that what he was trying to get across would really benefit them. In the end he was able to fully make amends with everyone. Although counties slip, everyone was not in their own place without fighting or harming one another. How this relates to world religions would be the simple fact of one person trying to make a change in the world. He not only wanted peace in where his home land was he wanted others around the world to actually see that without violence many things could be accomplished. You just need to stand up for what you believe in. he tried many ways to keeping things by using their laws and just showing them they are not `savages' that they are indeed people of their own kind. For the Brittan's felt they would not ever be able to fully understand why the are needed their and with help they could make them `civilized'. To me I felt like this just makes things wost when others try and come into a place and `help' them when they clearly know what is going to happen.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|One of the best new albums I have heard this year. The guitar and vocals have continued to be the winning combination for the band.
B0053O89RY|2.0|this is a 3 disc set and the 3rd disc will not play in anything I have, not the DVD player, not the computers.  It is very dirty and has what seems to be a spray on the disc that does not clean off.  I am very dissapointed as I cannot see the end of this tv shows season!
1401235417|5.0|my son will love this! thank you This will be his fourteenth birthday gift . He will be so excited about this gift!
B00000J0O2|5.0|It is great to have a source for ink cartridge for out-of-production printer.  This cartridge works well and fits the printer.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|The game is lots of fun it works great. Very frustrating though. Many levels have to be played over and over and they constantly want money.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It'd be nice if you started where you crashed, but it's a fun game. No problems on my Fire HD.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|His storylines are poignant and his characters all have many layers and nuances - all of which make it a good read.<br />This is not a four states read for me bc I felt like parts of the story were incomplete (the fate of Iqbal's family, the druglord's son; Theirry's reconciliation for example).<br />I did find the carefully interwoven global politics truly compelling.
1612183956|5.0|The story landed at a fast pace and kept it up throughout the entire book. No second guessing here, the ending was fresh, new, and unexpected. This was a fantastic read, all sci fi readers should love it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's habit forming! I'm looking forward to many hours of enjoyment. A great device to help improve concentration and decision-making.
1452126577|5.0|This book is much funnier than I expected.  When people visit the first thing they seem to do is flip through this book.  It is cute, funny, and fun for all ages.  So pretty much the perfect coffee table book.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Great for decision-making and eye hand togetherness. Should help younger players with observation. This should be a good game for senior citizens.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Unfortunately Olympus has changed its card format so this is the only place to purchase these cards...and with limited supply, comes a higher price.

B006PFC2S2|5.0|I really liked this movie. Though some of the dance scenes were a little long and odd, I loved the music and the story line.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book!  The whole series is wonderful!  Especially if you are interested in mythology or want to get someone interested in it.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Buyer beware!<br /><br />The free TuneIn Radio is great and has become my<br />daily application.  I paid for the Pro version so that<br />I could do timed recordings of my favorite programs.<br />That feature either does not work at all, or has<br />hidden/unadvertised restrictions that are impossible<br />to figure out. (Other apps work just fine on that<br />device.)<br /><br />If you want alarms or timed recordings do not buy<br />this product.<br /><br />I have wasted way more than the $4.99 I paid.<br />Now it is $6.99. I've written off the $4.99 to support<br />the _excellent_ free version.<br /><br />The TuneIn CEO was on the spot in relaying my<br />concerns to TuneIn technical support.  That support<br />has been reasonably responsive. I am quite happy<br />there, even though my issue remains unresolved.

B009GEPPYC|5.0|I saw the play on Broadway with Constantine in the cast and it was a great show - although maybe cocktail service at the seats throughout the performance had an effect. The audience got pretty rowdy toward the end of the show. I was prepared to dislike the movie. There are not too many movie adaptions of musical plays that I have enjoyed. In fact, I did not see it in the theater; however, I was looking for a movie to download to my Kindle Fire. I had read that Tom Cruise was quite amazing, and when I saw they had an extended version with extra scenes and background footage, I figured, \\"Why not?\\"<br /><br />I am so glad. I love the movie. It is not the stage show, but it is equally entertaining. All of the cast members do an excellent job. Even Alec Baldwin's awkwardness in his musical contributions is appealing, as he discovers some important truths about his life.<br /><br />I just posted a review for the soundtrack album [[ASIN:B007PKSN6Q Rock of Ages:  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]. It is also excellent. I was already in my thirties when these songs became rock anthems, and they became the soundtrack of many lives, mine among them. Take me down to Paradise City where the grass is green and the girls are pretty! Take me home!!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I saw the show on Broadway when Constantine was in the cast and loved it. Only show I've ever heard of with cocktail service during the show. The last act got pretty rowdy. I had so many doubts that I did not see the movie in the theater. Then, when I saw they had an extended version with extra scenes and behind-the-scenes footage, I couldn't resist. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire so it would be portable. I really wanted the music too, but I wondered if some of the songs would be truncated, as they were in the movie. Not the duets, trios and quartets interweaving songs, those are great. My greatest frustration was the opening number, Paradise City, a song I love. Tom Cruise did such a terrific job (as he did on all his tunes) that it was very frustrating to hear only a few bars. Well, on the CD, it is all there and then some.<br /><br />There are 20 tracks. The entire cast does a wonderful job. You do not have to have seen the play or the movie to rock out. You don't have to know the plot or who the characters are. The music stands entirely on its own merits.<br /><br />I would also recommend the movie [[ASIN:B009GEPPYC Rock Of Ages: Extended Edition (plus bonus features)]] if you love the music as much as I do. It is the soundtrack of many lives including mine. I was already in my thirties, but started loving rock in the 1960s and have never stopped. Come on down to Paradise City where grass is green and the girls are pretty! Take me home!!!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|What a refreshing action flick. Great action, great story, gritty, and well acted. A truly original movie. BTW, nothing like the Stallone movie. Way better.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The is the second book in the new Follet series.  The first was the Fall Of Giants. Follet is doing a great job of carrying on the essence of the families all of the world into the next generation. He is a master at this. I love the second book as much as the first.  And it is a new era - WW II, one of my favorite periods of in history, and the families are in Germany, Spain, Russia, England and the U.S. Your only challenge is keeping track of the expanding families! I would have not reservations recommending this if you are a Follet fan, but read Fall of Giants first.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I listen to this album over and over. There are many great songs on it. My favorites are &#34;Everything&#34; and &#34;Lost&#34;. We went to his concert and it was great too. I'm getting his newer albums now!
B000088E6D|3.0|I like a lot of what he sings, so this CD is great for that. I bought two of his albums for the first time, this one and a newer one, I personally like the newer one more. I had a chance to see his concert two days ago and he puts on a great show!
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I wasn't expecting that I would like this show - I'm well out of my teens, so I thought that I wouldn't be able to relate to the characters much less sympathize with them.<br /><br />I was wrong. Jenna is a slightly awkward teen (though not nearly as awkward as she thinks she is), and the actress who plays her handles the role deftly. I find myself rooting for Jenna even when she makes stupid, teenage, hormonal decisions, mostly because I seem to remember making one or two (or twelve) of those myself.<br /><br />In short, this show is entertaining, light, and the episodes are short enough that if you haven't tried it already, you should go ahead and check it out now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What I like about this game is the minions and especially the baby minion it sounds cute when they cry and when they suck on the thing.
B00008G8M4|4.0|It was in very good condition:) It wasn't open and was in original wrapper. This was a good purchase and great gift.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Murder investigation games are awesome they are so fun you should get crime games if you love mystery this game is awesome
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found Walter's writing excellent. I am an avid reader, but I found myself looking up a few words, which I love. I like to learn new things, and the kindle edition is great for that! It took me a long time to read, as it's very detailed and descriptive- so I was glad I didn't borrow it from a library, or I would have had to renew it a few times!
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|First experiment didn't even work for me! I guess it doesn't work that well..<br />Great for motivation if you need it
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What can you say about Andrea Bocelli's voice.  A voice of an angel  Andrea Bocelli can not produce a CD or sing anything that is not magnificent
B002RKXO5E|5.0|I recommend! Gary Barlow, Jason Orange, Mark Owens and Howard Donald perform all together an exceptionally talented group. Beautiful voices, always perfect, very professionals and enjoyable. Extremely entertaining; a show beautifully choreographed, supported by a high standard cast.  An amazing experience, a performance full of surprises!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great Musical  The story and the music could not be any better.  Brings you into that era in France's history
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was quite entertaining and kept you guessing.  I definitely like the first part of the book better than the last part as I had figured out a lot of the plot.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|Douglas and Damon shine as Liberace and his sometimes lover Scott in this story of the gay entertainer and the drama and heartbreak that went on behind all the glitz and glamour.  For mature audiences, of course.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creepy and addictive, totally lived up to expectations from watching first season. Background and everything about this series is scary.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've gotten super far and have been playing on multiplayer with my friends. The graphics are great too and I'm Addicted to the fun
0307120007|1.0|Cheaply and poorly made spiral bound book.  Not like the great ones I used to buy.  Very disappointed.  I would look for a better made copy of this book.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher is the perfect mentor as we charge into a new world. He doesn't just give advice, he tells us how to implement it. I can't thank him enough!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's  peaceful, cute, competitive, fun, and a unique experience. This is very well made technically and artisticly. The game reminds me of Neopets and Sims. Play it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is mentally challenging - lots of layers and variations to keep it interesting from one game to the next.  And how great to have the adorable Minions available 24/7!
B00AG473GE|5.0|Classic 80's movie. One of the greatest. Some of the 80's most famous movie actors. A must see love story.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A interesting take on what man would do for survival... Would we train children to be ruthless killers if it meant the survival of the species? I really enjoyed the strategy and inside thinkings of Enders mind. I was fascinated :)
0062255657|2.0|This is not what I expected....I am not fond of books that are based on fantasy. It reminds me in that way of The Night Circus. I understand that it takes an extraordinary mind to conceive of a plot, but it is not for me.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a fantastic book at the intersection of liberal arts, technology and business.  It was thoroughly researched and is well written.  Steve Jobs was a complex man and this book does a great job at highlighting or explaining those complexities.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Ends horribly without any answers. I love the relationship but you should finish a book feeling satisfied! I'm disappointed in the effort to force you to buy the next book!!!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this book.  There are VERY few non-fiction books that I can't put down, but this was one of them.  I'm definitely a &#34;high reactive&#34; introvert.  This book explained a lot of what makes me me.
B007SGM084|5.0|The title of the book says one thing, but once you start reading this book, it will began to pull you into it and you will be hook... Awesome Book!!!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|i love it it is very useful to me because i love muice i love to listen to bangarang and radioactive.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This has all the features that I was looking for at a decent price. Try the free version first and the ability to play your own tunes is worth the upgrade.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandberg nails it with respect to working conditions for college educated women in the US and offers good advice to those who aspire to leadership positions.  Her insights and suggestions apply broadly, not just to those with degrees from elite schools. As a recently retired &#34;female&#34; senior executive, I can personally endorse the messages Sandberg delivers.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Many people are under the impression that you have to spend $50 to get a good RS-232 cable with the null modem and crossover wiring. Not so. I got two of these for around $25, and finished the job in less than half the time that they contracted me for.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|How do I even begin to talk about Fangirl without flailing about like an actual fangirl?<br /><br />First off, the cover is pretty adorable. I really like that it complements the covers of Rowell's other published books. Honestly, my expectations for Fangirl were set pretty high because of how deeply I fell in love with Eleanor and Park. Well, I don't know why I would have worried because Rainbow Rowell is a an amazing author and her writing really shines in Fangirl.<br /><br />Cather and Wren are identical twin sisters who are separated for the first time when Wren decides she doesn't want to be roommates their freshman year in college. This puts Cath's anxiety on high alert as Wren has always been there to help her get through her rougher moments in life. Without Wren as a roommate, she's stuck with Reagan and Levi.<br />Rainbow couldn't have done a more perfect job nailing the character's voices. I was completely lost in this story, almost nothing felt out of place or forced. The pacing was dead on. At first I didn't realize fan fiction would play so predominately and that worried me a bit. You see, I'm not the biggest fan of fan fiction. Not only that, I'm not really a fan of non-canon. So when I started reading this and realized there was non-canon fan fiction about a Harry Potter-esque book I got a bit worried. After about the first chapter all my fan fiction worries were over. I was still a little weirded out about the Simon Snow books because in my brain it just felt like a cheap Harry Potter knock off but at least the fan fiction wasn't a problem.<br /><br />Like Eleanor and Park, Fangirl tackles deep issues extremely well. The characters and their messed up situations are both heartfelt and depressing. Rainbow toes the line between the two which kept me from being too overwhelmed with the sad stuff mixed in. Reading Cath's experience with college felt like I was given a window to look at my freshman year. I grew up a homebody that never liked sleepovers, always preferred staying home and reading over going to parties and that didn't change when I went to college. Luckily I did make friends but it was hard at first. I remember the same anxiety Cath had about going to the dining hall. I even had a roommate that would try to drag me out places, and I'm sure she was over me.<br /><br />Just like Eleanor and Park, Rainbow Rowell comes at us with another five star worthy book.lways preferred staying home and reading over going to parties and that didn't change when I went to college.

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The first time I read &#34;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&#34; I was 10 years old and it was in Greek. Since then it has always kept a warm place in my heart. I really enjoyed reading the original many years later.

B00003CXFV|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and still it catches my attention and reminds me of what determination and gut instincts can do for you when applied and followed up on.  This is a classic movie not to be forgotten.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I saw a review for 1 star because they didn't know how to play it..... Linda sad dude. this is probably the simplest game I play. other than the fact its a 3 dollar game its probably worth it considering the play time I got out of it

B00BSWMITK|5.0|He is a groovy guitarist! Just seeing him live is an experience! This album is alot of Fun! I love this album alot!
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Well-developed themes include the meaning of adult love and what a father owes a son.  As entertainment the film engages the audience and builds suspense.  It has an appealing texture of river culture with some rural/Southern values thrown in.  It's actually refreshing in that it touches on life in the South (though not the Deep South) without the often-mandatory and sometimes heavy-handed, unflattering race relations bromides.  The film isn't as tight as we'd like but that aspect is offset somewhat by the interesting character of Mud, played well by Mathew McC.  Joe Don Baker as the protagonist doesn't live up to the advance depiction of him by Mud.  Sam Shepard, as the hesitant force for good in the background, conveys just the right scoop of mystery and authenticity.  The actor playing the central role of the 14-year-old kid does a good job of pulling the audience into the narrative.<br /><br />In the end you wonder how much more grippingly this worthwhile, if not epic, story could have been told.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Great eye opener into the tragic treatment of Jews by the Nazi. Like Anne Frank but this occurs in France. Very sad but well worth watching.
B000FC13UE|3.0|The stories started out fun to read but just became a means of shocking the reader towards the end. The last several stories in the collection are the first from Gaiman to disappoint me. Not that they're bad, just not my thing. Read them and judge for yourself.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|movie was entertaining, but lacked strong suspense. did not encounter any scares while watching this movie, but for the most part seemed to be done well
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|Its ok kinda slow but story is ok if you like Jodie foster you will like the movie for sifi
B00CATONCA|5.0|Sure you can pay half as much for just the discs, but you are totally missing out on this sweet zombie head tank!
B0041VV03A|2.0|Its a ok movie but its not that good is kinda of stupid in ways but its ok to watch one time
B006LSZECO|2.0|Everyone recommended this book to me, so I thought I needed to read it, but I kept waiting to care about the characters.  It was suspenseful, as you are never sure what the truth is or if you can trust the thoughts of the characters.  But to me, that just made it annoying.
B009AMAJPA|4.0|I think the people who gave Dead Man Down negative reviews are much closer to the mark than those who rate it highly.  The dialogue is banal, starting with the opening line. It doesn't get better.  The plot is improbable, derivative, and highly predictable. The last 30 minutes move at a snail's pace as we watch characters in the film figure out for themselves--in a series of \\"duh!\\" moments\\" what we knew 20-40 minutes ago.  Why watch the film, then?  For the acting and the cinematography.  Colin Farrell and Roomi Mara actually do a lot of very good work with a pretty empty script.  And here's another reason: Isabelle Huppert is in the film--who knows why.  Terence Stamp also delivers an amazing performance.  The film is highly watchable. The shots are original and the pacing excellent for the first 90 minutes.  My guess is that this was originally a great film until someone demanded it be dumbed down and seriously slowed down near the end so Dead Man Down  could compete with such wonders of cinema as The Hit Man or The Punisher.  Or perhaps it wanted to follow The Professional and La femme Nikita and failed.  In any case, it is a decent time-waster.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Cute movie for girls especially. Enjoyed sitting down to watch it.  *Spoiler* I didn't realize shape-shifting was involved, that made it a little strange for me.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|A trusted source for weather remains trusted....but please explain why it now has me earning points. I think it's an advertising thing, but it is annoying. The overall operation is clean and works consistently. Using it on my Kindle and I like that I can turn off alerts.

B00ARF92HK|4.0|This one was much better than &#34;Judge Dredd&#34;. The story line was still a little weak but more &#34;believable&#34;, the acting was on par for this type of movie and the action sequences did not disappoint .
B009KS4XRO|5.0|-keeps me in the game. great pastime. find this to be one of the best stress relievers for PTSD!! Love to play these games.
B007ZYK3CE|2.0|Not my type of movie. If it had revealed a direction by the 30 minute mark ... I might have stuck around, but as far as I could tell, it wasn't going to get any better.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like every thing except the coin options. Seems us gotta spend real money to get the good things. So I just run without them. Still a lot of fun
B005LJKEXS|5.0|My wife needed this to connect to a \\"smart whiteboard\\" product that was a long way from her computer. I bought this hoping that it would reach/work. This active extension worked perfectly, even with the extra 10 feet at the end (a total of about 42 feet). Very pleased.

B002SSUQFG|1.0|When I purchased this watch I felt confident it would keep good time since it was a Seiko product. I knew it was low end, and figured that the lack of quality would show in durability, not in functionality. As it turns out, after 2 months of use, it's in great shape but from day one has been UNABLE to keep good time. I've recorded it's malfunction and it will run 5-6 minutes fast within 48 hours of setting it. As a long time Seiko timepiece owner, I am VERY disappointed with this product and wish I could return it, as I feel confident mine in particular is a defect. However, just to be cautious I wouldn't recommend it!
B0006J28BO|3.0|(coming from a viewer who is far from childhood...)<br />This sounded much better than the delivery -- I felt the adventure in the kingdom of cats was predictable and not that innovative.<br />The graphics weren't as fun as I expected, since I love to watch cats of all kinds.

B007EC27QM|5.0|When I was looking for a calculator there was one function I really wanted and that was the ongoing tape feature. This app has that and when you don't balance that is the greatest thing to have. It lets you see what you entered and where you made your mistake. You will not be disappointed in this app if all you need is a basic calculator. Thanks for a great user friendly app.

B009WUAK2M|2.0|i was not expecting much so i wasn't disappointed.  acting was not good, especially Arnold. there was action and isn't that the whole point of shows like this?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|A good read, but the stories were too disjointed to weave together into a whole.  The POV makes for an almost perfunctory &#34;news reading&#34; sensibility.
B008469DGY|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. Flicking a golf ball feels like a much more fluid way to play a golfing game, and it really gets you into it.<br /><br />However, it can be very difficult. The first couple of levels aren't too bad, but with the rest of the levels you have to get a high amount of hole-in-ones to even get to the next level. That may need to be dialed down a bit.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It captured and held my interest from the very first chapter.  I will recommend this book to my friends.  I will also check out other books written by this author.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|I heard all about it. How could I not? I love death metal and have followed Morbid Angel ever since I got into the genre. Altars of Madness remains one of my favorite albums of all time. So of course I saw the bad reviews and ringing denunciations of their \\"I\\" album from all corners of the metalverse. But now, more than two years after its release, I finally gave Illud Divinum Insanus a chance. The verdict? It's almost as bad as I feared. Not a total disaster, perhaps, but still a betrayal of epic proportions.<br /><br />The two-and-a-half-minute intro track is so cheesy it could open a power/folk album, and when it segued into the halting, ridiculous 'Too Extreme!', I knew this one would hurt. \\"We are your new religion, no religion,\\" David Vincent barks endlessly over redundant pseudo-industrial guitars. This is capped off with a layered and artificially repeated roar at the end. The song sounds like an ill-conceived demo recorded inside a port-a-potty, and it doesn't stop there.<br /><br />The rest of Illud sounds like two different albums put together. Half of the tracks are mediocre, watered-down death metal. There are a few decent riffs and guitar solos in there, but the songs are marred by Vincent's weak vocals and a dreadful snare drum. It sounds like a hyperactive four-year-old tapping on upside-down paper plates with plastic utensils,. Everyone points to 'Nevermore' or 'Blades For Baal' as the best of the death-ish songs, though I give the nod to 'Beauty Meets Beast' for having some actual intensity.<br /><br />The other half of the album is more nightmarish wankery like 'Too Extreme!': lame, posturing electronic rock songs with knuckle-dragging chants and ego-stroking lyrics about how great Morbid Angel are. One of the worst offenders is 'I Am Morbid', which kicks off with a simulated crowd chant before launching into embarrassing lines like \\"We stand invincible, not just a dream, straight from the underground we SCREEEEAM, Morbid Morbid Morbid!\\" News flash, Morbid Angel: weak self-promoting drivel like this is about as far from the metal underground as you can get. And I won't even get started on 'Radikult', which sees Vincent chanting either \\"kill a cop\\" or \\"killa cult\\" over a stark, uninspired rhythm that sounds like the same four-year-old from the drum kit is kicking aluminum siding.<br /><br />Overall, this was a painful listening experience and I don't plan to repeat it. If memory serves, Morbid Angel said they would be incorporating a more industrial sound in this album. And naturally I thought \\"okay, so it's industrial death.\\" Well it isn't. Nailbomb and early Fear Factory were industrial death. This is hideous industrial experimentation conducted on the body of their now dying death metal legacy. Rest in peace, guys.h, Morbid Angel: weak self-promoting drivel like this is about as far from the metal underground as you can get.

Some do it because they don't have a clue about Morbid Angel and think this is really ROCKIN'. Some want to believe it's an ironic masterpiece or a fantastic joke. News flash guys, the emperor is naked. This is not what you wanted to hear from Morbid Angel, nor can I in good conscience call it death metal. This is nothing less than a self-penned career obituary. Rest in peace.

B002TZ3FE2|4.0|Apart from the semi-autobiographical echoes of Atwood's own father, this book resonates for me because it covers the same social history that I grew through in Australia.<br />Atwood has woven tangible links through her artist heroine's life story, including the cats eye marble and a red plastic purse, along with recurring appearances of a childhood friend.
B00D5LC4GY|1.0|Don't bother with this app - you may think you're getting something like tetris but it's only a simple puzzle where you're given &#34;pieces&#34; you have to fit together to make a cube.
0030565812|5.0|Enjoyed it very much. A very compelling and informative autobiography. Enjoyable read. Keep track of the acronyms, there are many of them.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is by far one of the best television shows on network tv! I'm so happy that Amazon Prime has instant video with this show. Besides watching recent episodes on the CBS website, this is the only outlet that you can watch all seasons and get caught up for Season 5!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|While I am more of a \\"The Next Generation\\" and \\"Voyager\\" fan, I have fallen in love with Karl Urban's Bones in the new movies. IMO, this movie is actually better then the first one! The comedy is there (the argument between Uhura and Spock while Kirk is stuck between them is my favorite), the bonding has taken place from the first movie to where you believe these characters have been together since they assembled in the first, and a bit of tradition thrown in there for long-time Trek fans. The movie is fast-paced, sometimes I think a little too much, but I appreciate that they don't linger on details like some of the previous Star Treks have done. I love the return of some of the favorite lines from the first movie like Scotty's \\"Get down!\\" So while J.J. Abrams is building on the Star Trek so many Trek fans know, he's also building that what he has created new for us. I do have to say to something that has nothing to do with anything else in this review.... the moment that Uhura turns to kiss Spock in front of everyone really surprised me, but I loved it when he lowered his head to allow it.<br /><br />All in all, J.J. has done a great job. I love this movie even more the first and have watched it already more then I have watched the first one. I think both non-traditional Trek fans and true-blue Trek fans will love it if they don't go digging for reasons not to. J.J. has rebirthed Star Trek, a tradition that was lost to many new potential fans, and he's doing awesome at the helm!<br /><br />But forget Spock and Kirk (even though the actors are perfect), it's Bones is my new favorite thanks to Karl Urban! And let's be honest... that's who I loved returning to my screen!
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Too many twists and turns in this drama. By the end of the movie I did not care for the characters any more.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Simple to install and use but only streams video from predetermined apps.  Should be able stream any video from my phone, tablet or laptop.<br /><br />After some online digging found a way to stream screens from Google Chrome browser after adding a Chromecast extension to the browser.  Note streaming static screens to my BSTV was okay but streaming videos from Chrome was not - - jerky/halty video stream from Chrome still does no fix the problem.  I should be able to stream ANYTHING from my laptop to Chromecast.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|A love story about the rich and the poor. A little slow and long. If you are in the mood for a love story and are a fan of Dicaprio worth renting.
1781162646|5.0|This novel is a fine coming of age story set in a fun park on the North Carolina coast.  It is also a love story, and also happens to be an excellent example of the horror genre by the well established master of the field.  The story focuses on three young college hopefuls - Devon, Tom and the red-headed stunner, Miss Erin.  By definition, we all learn valuable lessons at this juncture of our lives, but over that classic summer, young Jonesy and his friends learn much more than the average 21 year old will ever learn.<br /><br />Social commentary abounds in Joyland, like it does in many other Stephen King classics.  The first one to jump up and poke me in the metaphorical eye came from page 99, paragraph 4:<br /><br />' ... A boy with bad thoughts needs to be visiting a haunted house like he needs arsenic in his mouthwash.  Kapish?'<br /><br />This is not overly deep but it is a nice reminder to stay on the safe side of the street, and keep away from the metaphorical shadows that exist on the edge of our consciousness, tempting, tempting, always tempting...<br /><br />Mr King's writing style is subtle, sweet and as always, potentially terrifying.  His ability to turn on the scare factor virtually at will after  moving the reader virtually to tears is legendary, and just before we hit the half way mark of this tome, we are gifted with the supernatural highlight of the book so far as the trio of friends (and soon to be lovers)  decide to experience \\"horror house\\" for themselves.  Their first mistake.  As it turns out, this exercise affects just one of the trio, but the specified party member is never the same again.<br /><br />Talk about a high cost of admission.<br /><br />Anyway, the second half the story takes an interesting twist when Devon meets and befriends Annie and young son Mike Ross.  The story gains depth and credence from a horror perspective when he learn of the psychic abilities of Mike and of course long term fans of Mr King can't wait to find out what happens in this half of the book.<br /><br />So, in summary, JOYLAND is at once a fantastic addition to the extraordinary collection that is the library of Stephen King, and also the perfect entree to the forthcoming sequel to one of Mr King's early classics (THE SHINING).<br /><br />The purchase of this book is another no-brainer.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!happens in this half of the book.<br /><br />So, in summary, JOYLAND is at once a fantastic addition to the extraordinary collection that is the library of Stephen King, and also the perfect entree to the forthcoming sequel to one of Mr King's early classics (THE SHINING).<br /><br />The purchase of this book is another no-brainer.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I know people say that they can't get passed the air plane level. Just press the settings button and turn airplane level off and then your set. The video is also really funny.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I would recommend this book to everybody who likes adventure and just plain old interesting books. I gave the book four stars because it was a really good book, but there were a little bit of boring parts. Not much, and definitely still interesting enough to read, but that ended up giving it four stars instead of five.
B00007LTIL|5.0|If you love great song writing and playing to a standard rarely if ever seen any more, just go buy this album and its \\"companion\\" Workingman's Dead, two of the best records made by anybody any time! Both are \\"greatest hits\\" albums in the very best sense in that every single track is simply great music. Whilst I've seen most everyone in concert I've ever wanted to see, one of my greatest regrets is that I never saw The Grateful Dead live. I'm told they were a truly awesome experience in concert. At least we have their considerable recorded legacy, much of it live performances, Just buy this. Simply brilliant stuff!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The weaving of the characters story was fantastic.  I have not been disappointed by any of his books.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Like &#34;Ender&#34; this is a good book but I agree with Card where the children's roles become confused.  Hindsight is 20/20 but more could have been done with less confusion along the way. Pure escapism with a view of humanity on the darker side with a superficial and optimistic outcome.  Of course this would have lead to a much longer book but it may have come through the process as a far more satisfying experience.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I can't believe I did 300 algebra problems FOR FUN, but I did. I bought this app on the recommendation of my supervisor for my 8-year-old daughter who is very math-minded. Before I presented it to her to try, I thought I would try it myself. As a schoolteacher, I could recognize the skills being practiced at each level, but it was very subtle. I ended up playing all levels of the game before turning it over to my child. She also quickly completed multiple levels and only brought it to me twice to say &#34;I can't get this one.&#34; She did not get bored or frustrated, and was excited to see the dragons as they grew.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great book that I've read repeatedly.  You know it always end the same way?  Anyway each time you read it you can take different meaning.  Meaning is in the head of the reader.  Kind of like a story that can be allegorical if you assign the deeper side.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|This cover was exactly as described. Slim fit but so far has provided great protection. The case is very easy to assemble, apply and remove.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is the best game of our generation not just because of the fact that<br />it's the original version not one of those macho blow offs it's because of the zombies<br />and the other mobs I'd say you should get it!

B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed reading it and I felt it was dealing with things like coal and world tension that is very current.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I just wasted 3 dollars on a game that didn't work. that is why I'm giving it 1 star.  plz fix this ninjas kiwi, then ill give you 5 stars.  Ps. its on my kindle fire

B009NQZVKG|5.0|ROLLINS is always a lot of fun to read.  I love how he throws just enough real history and science that leaves you wanting to know more on the subject.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I wish I had gone to the theatre to see this.<br />I didn't because the title is so stupid; don't let that fool you, this is a great movie.<br />It's such an excellent movie, and Daniel Craig is a wonderful actor.<br />I enjoy it more each time I watch it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Ah the only bad thing about the game, to addicting!!!  It is amazing it's so fun to challenge ure friend to see who can reach level 20 or 5 first. Must have game. It's free for crying out loud!!!!!!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Really explores the divide between the rich and the poor.<br />It's very relevant to our times, and the acting is superb.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is awesome I loved the pod racer level and I loved Yoda when he spin and I loved Anakin.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|I was a little put-off by how the movie was shot, but it grew on me. The story line is your standard treasure hunt affair, but the story telling is first rate.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Great movie. Had me on the edge of my seat at many points-  don't know why so many complained about it when it was in theaters
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Enjoy playing the game,all seems so real, but wish it would give you move acorns through out the game in ice or though friends
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Oh goodness - the lives of the women in this book! Another book from Hosseini that gives insight into war torn Middle East. Another must read book!
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Really fun and addictive game! Hard to put down, fun way to pass time. Definately a recomendable game. Fun, fun.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Epic in the great big amazing sense not in the most wonderful don't miss it sense I had read the novel and it is hard to follow 6 stories in 1 different styles each one stopping in the middle as it builds then finishes in reverse order. One would think the directing team would decide to make it flow a little more but they chose to jump around in an almost arbitrary fashion. If I hadn't read it first I would never have known  what was going on. It must have been fun for the actors playing 6 different parts and is interesting trying to pick out the lead actors in each role.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Honestly, this movie really isn't a love story. It's something far better... it really connected with me. I felt like I could relate to how the characters felt. And, of course, Joseph Gordon Levitt is hot.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is very addictive that once you pick it up you don't want to put it down. So glad my friend recommended this to me
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|This book made me start a great Labor Weekend trip. I was reading it while I was flying to Cancun. Soft, interesting and great story.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Didn't expect much from it, but was pleasantly surprised. Very fun movie to watch, would definitely recommend it if you aren't wanting something super cerebral. A couple of good twists as well.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|There is another review of the blu-ray version that gives it 2 starts and says it is disappointing. After reading that review and buying it anyway I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised that the blu-ray it is a HUGE improvement over my old DVD copy. It has not been digitally remastered but it obviously has been rescanned in HD. I have watched the process being done on old Hollywood movies. Basically the studio uses a good good print of the film for the rescan then does some color grading. It is not a major overhaul of the film but it does bring the film into the world of HD. So if you are a big fan of Logan's Run like I am and like to watch it every few years, this is a great improvement over the basic DVD release. It has no frills other than the film itself.<br /><br />I am happy to find on MY machine that if I stop the film and turn off the Blu-ray player; when I come back a day later and push \\"play\\" the film starts where I left off - unlike a lot of other Blu-rays which then force you to watch all the FBI warnings, menu screens, etc all over again (I can't say it will start/stop on all all machines - but it does it on mine)<br /><br />Not to mention when I bought this on Amazon it was about $7.00. So for watching purposes I'm happy I bought it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is so I can do that when the remastered version eventually comes out.... if it ever does...

0385528787|4.0|Before I read this book I read or reread \\"Oryx and Crake\\" and \\"The Year of the Flood\\".  If I hadn't I don't know that I'd have understood or been as interested in \\"MaddAdam\\".  It's not a stand alone book in my opinion.  I thought the trilogy overall was good though I'd rate \\"Oryx\\" three stars and \\"Flood\\" as five stars.  \\"MaddAdam\\" had some great parts and some slow parts, mostly the sections where Atwood `told' rather than showed the action.  The parts concerning the storytelling to the Crakers especially drags however try and be patient with it because there are some important plot elements imbedded in the stories.  Atwood is a Goddess of metaphors and she out did herself throughout these books in that area.  The implications will have your mind spinning.<br /><br />I haven't read a lot of the kid focused dystopia lit that's popular right now but compared to the ones from that genre that I have read this is vastly more mature and complicated and believable.  In fact some of it is just a shade off what has happened or could happen in our current world which is what makes it so good.  It's just matter of degree.  As always Atwood's viewpoint is first of all human but also feminist though she isn't strident.  Toby, the main female character in this book, is an example of that.  She's concentrated on staying alive but also in being fully human which includes love for her partner and for the larger group.  I loved the bee lore that's sprinkled throughout the book.  Zeb, Toby's lover, is a study in contrast.  He's a big, manly man who carries a big stick.  Consequently it's comforting to have him around in this end of the world scenario.  A satisfying conclusion to this series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|THE Low Down<br />Lou has lived her 26 years quietly within the borders of her small English town, holding the same job for nearly a decade, helping her family get by, keeping her resentments to herself as she puts her family before her. Will has spent his time traveling the world, amassing wealth and a life list that many modern day adventurers would envy until a motorcycle accident derails his high flying lifestyle, leaving him a quadriplegic. Lou's life is also turned upside down when the loss of her job also shakes the stability of her neatly ordered world.<br /><br />Lou in need of a job and Will in need of a \\"companion\\", their lives are thrown together in a way both despise. Lou does not want to be the companion to someone who hates her; Will doesn't want a companion of any kind, or to continue living a life where he requires one. But there is much more to the story than Lou first realizes, as Will already has plans to escape. But not if Lou has anything to do with.<br /><br />MY Low Down<br />This has been touted as a modern day love story, but to say only does a disservice to this incredibly deep, heart wrenching novel that can both lift you up and knock you down in a matter of seconds. It looks at some of life's most difficult questions in a way that is so fluid and moving that you often don't realize the importance of the subject at hand, just that it has been presented in a way that is both readable and thought provoking.<br /><br />At its heart are the characters who are actually REAL. No, they didn't hop out of the book and start having a conversation with me, but it felt like they could have. Louisa is the child who has always been second fiddle to the \\"better at everything\\" older sibling. She compensated by dressing in bright colors, bringing home money to contribute to the family kitty, remaining stable in the face of her sister's \\"look at me! Love ME!\\" attitude. We've all known this person, been this person, and Lou embodies it in a way that is realistic, lovable, annoying and relatable all at once. While her stability has helped her family, it has hindered her personally. She's never left the shadow of the castle, her town's one claim to tourist fame, and she doesn't really care if she ever does. Will on the other hand was happy to leave it in the dust to wander streets of Paris, surf on exotic beaches, leap tall buildings (or off tall mountains, or planes, or whatever else he could get his hands on) in a single bound. Now, Lou has the ablebodiedness to do the exploring but not the heart to do it. Will has the heart but not the physical ability. The combination of these personalities brought out one of the many deeper messages from within the pages: do YOU live your life to its fullest? And if you're Lou, you also ask who has the right to judge whether you have or not? And if you act as your own judge and jury, from what are you basing your opinion? There are no actual answers to these questions, for anyone, anywhere, yet they are ones that many of us spend a great deal of time in life trying to answer. If we are lucky, we may someday know ourselves well enough to trust that our verdict is correct, or have enough faith in ourselves to follow through, but that is such a personal thing that I honestly don't feel it can even be described.<br /><br />The relationship the develops between Lou and Will is tenuous at first but develops into genuine love for one another, though the way they see their future and what that love means could not be farther apart from one another. Lou can't see her life without Will, who has opened her heart, her mind, and the doors through which she has begun to broaden her horizons. Will can't see his life at all, and even worse he can't see himself burdening Lou's newfound freedom and passion with his disability. To Lou, losing Will is unimaginable. To Will, losing Lou is the ONLY thing he can do. The manifestations of their love for one another are in such different realms of human thought that it is hard to believe that stem from a common bond, but JoJo Moyes takes you through their relationship in such a way that it ultimately more sense than you ever could have imagined. Don't get me wrong - it sucks - I cried like a baby - but it made sense. And I loved it for it. There is not happy anything here, yet somehow it is all happy. It forces you to look at a perspective that is not often brought up.<br /><br />Plus, the writing is just excellent!<br /><br />- Leah @ Yummy Reads -
B002SAUCBC|2.0|I could find no real message in this story which is surprising as I have enjoyed many of Stephen Kings books.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Who doesn't love the guy?! Still reading all I can by this author. You won't be sorry for choosing this one.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I found this book very informative.  I've followed the diet for 2 months and find it very much to my liking.  Everyone must find the right diet for themselves and this one works for me.

B005DOKM9M|5.0|My mom gave my dad a Kindle Fire for Christmas so I got him this case and he loved it. Very soft and protective on the inside. The leather strap is a handle - how awesome?!

B005Q1W10A|5.0|The British are so thorough..... it is always a real pleasure to watch their 'period' films.  I heartily recommend it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this app. It's exciting &amp; a boat load of fun. Every hour you can log in &amp; get to choose between 3 scratch off card which you win 2,3,4,5, or 6 coins for more game play. Plus each time you log in Your automatically entered into the ally drawing for points. With points you can get special power up' s, which are pretty cool like when another player lays down a draw two card on you, you only draw one. Or make them draw two as well! It's addictive &amp; loads of fun. I find myself logging in OFTEN.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.  AND ITS FREE!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|the writing and the story line is very good all the actors do an excellent job and it is quite refreshing
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does a good job of cleaning my system and freeing up space.  This is the best free cleaner application I have found
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Great actors and a great twist! If you have a history in the mental health field (especially in forensics) you would appreciate this movie.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|If you haven't seen it yet, do so.  It is one of the best submarine films and absolutely the most realistic.  If you haven't seen it in a while, it is a great way to spend an evening.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|The app is missing some really good artists like night c o r e (without spaces stupid auto correct) and Monster cat (without spaces again) they only play the popular artists. If they fix that I won't have to search for good apps!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was a really funny movie and enjoyed by my husband and I as much as our 5 year old!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is not something I needed, just had to have, here are a few justifications -- and how the device has performed<br />When streaming content in any room, or even on the road, when I find that I have enough time to relax and view media I attach Chromecast to any HDMI port, and I am viewing on full-screen.  This has allowed for the removal of two devices which were simply cluttering space, and unused until time permitted.  On the road, while visiting family I have used the device to share media and it performed flawlessly, it has been connected to it's home network, public wiFi and my mobile hot-spot, all with excellent results.  While not in use the device takes less room to store than a remote presenter, less space in my gear bag than a granola bar, and yet allows me to view and share content.  The Chromecast is easy to set-up, extremely easy to operate, and does exactly what it is designed to do...
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not sure why I never rad it before now.  Very thought provoking and fascinatingly sad, but hopeful.  Hope the movie does it justice.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Amazing series! Despite its action, blood, and sex, plot line and clever dialog take center stage. Too bad more series and movies nowadays do not keep this in mind. Highly recommended for anyone who like good drama and/or Ancient Rome.
0802473156|5.0|Even if you're single, read it so you can know yourself better. I read it in snippets to my husband in our first year of marriage, and it was one of the things that kept us together.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I kind of like this game. It was easy to learn, tough to master. And hard to put down. This is a unique look at Temple run. A definite must download.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|very easy to set-up, great user interface on the iPhone.  Would be great if you could categorise/tag your heart rate measurements for context. Very pleased with this product
B00E00GCF8|5.0|Besy Buy will be the only retailer selling Blu Ray edition of this live release in a cd combo pack!
B00D2I8E46|2.0|I am an insane Elvis Costello fan, and I like the Roots, and so I looked forward to this collaboration.<br /><br />But one thing that I think no other reviewer has emphasized:  most of the lyrics are from previous EC songs, and many of the tracks include samples from other EC songs.<br /><br />This may seem like a \\"creative remix\\" of past material, but my own reaction was:  so Elvis, you are collaborating with the Roots here, and you can't be bothered to write any new material?<br /><br />The whole album has the feel of having been cooked up by EC and The Roots dropping by a studio and singing old songs in a different register with a Roots backbeat. I'm sure it was a nice couple of days' work, but shouldn't be taken as more than that.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This timely book has many uncanny resemblances to recent events. Dealing with a terrorist American in Yemen. The various uses of technology adds much to the story. The drone strike against Corey is disturbing.
1423101499|5.0|I enjoyed reading the whole series of books.  I found myself<br />trying to figure out which mythological person he was meeting<br />by the clues before they would tell me who it was.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have never read any of Brown's books. My son gave me the hardcover edition, but I'd rather carry around the Kindle! If you are interested in the geography and history of DC, this book is for you. Very entertaining and informative with a terrific story line.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  Trying to get your minion through<br />the Lab, Residential area, or El Macho's lair.  The only draw back is<br />you can't have different games for different people playing.  Everyone<br />in the house loves to play from My 3 yr old, 6 yr old, 9yr up to me and<br />my husband.
B00DQVST76|1.0|I bought 2 MDNA DVDs from different shops both faulty. 5.1 only coming through 2 speakers, terrible sound. Such a shame as I was really looking forward to this DVD. I would advise people not to buy this product until they sort it out. Sounds like everyone else is having the same problems.
140120841X|5.0|Alan Moore is a fantastic writer.  The movie does not do the literary magician justice.  This book grips you right from the start with an alternate future-Britain under the grip of fascist agents who spout ideals of freedom while they continually crush the right itself.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|great story line. belivable charectors and roles, outstanding visual effects. kept me interested all the way. well worth renting, I may buy.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|Some of the footage is dated, but overall the picture quality holds up on my HD TV.  This is the edition of ROBOCOP that everyone who loves this movie really wants to own.  FANTASTIC FILM, great DVD, perfect for anyone's collection.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I am a boomer and remember when Star trek first came out. Maybe my mind set has changed, but these new treks do not have the same &#34;hold you&#34; that previous treks had.
B0067R0APK|4.0|So far this is the best radar map for Kindle Fire HD, covering southern Arizona. Stats and data are presented in sharp, professional manner. The easily streamed region specific video is also a pleasant component.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|It's slow and not up to date. It doesn't refresh very often and it like I said, loads really slow.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very entertaining. Even the kids like this game. Some of it was hard but still enjoyed it. We need more like this to play. Great Game. Love It.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Brings together a finish in an acceptable way.  Much darker than prior two in the series and doesn't do as good of a job bringing reader into story...
B00AEFXXUK|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting was superb! This is one of those movies that I will watch again and again!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything I need.  I especially like the big size.  Easy to read.  The colors are pleasing to the eyes.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|If we are thinking that this is a movie about zombies, this is the great movie until now. everybody is writing bad reviews saying that the movie is so poor in is to be compare with the book. I want to say that the book was not written by Shakespeare and the team of the book is long time expired. The movie is good for the theme and the effects are more that I was expected for an action movie, very original.
B009O07NMA|4.0|This is quite possibly the perfect debut album. Cruise, Round Here, and Get Your Shine On are the perfect debut singles-Get Your Shine On is my favorite. These guys have great vocal harmonies, and all the songs on this album are great. You will love this terrific album-guaranteed. I sure hope they stick around!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought it for reading on my Kindle while on a short vacation and could not put it down although I had seen the film. Sometimes it gets a bit too long-winded describing peoples' clothes.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse has been performing amazingly for over 3 months all the keys work and I can change them to whatever I want whenever I want. The macro is great and the precision is perfect, I would recommend this mouse to any gamer or any person looking for a great mouse
0061730335|5.0|This is a great book. Bought it for my grandson as it was a required reading. I read it and loved it. Good reading for anyone!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game. Some of the areas of the levels can be pretty challenging. I'm ready to take on more levels.
1476734941|5.0|The fast diet book  really has interesting concept to diet and keeping  the weight off. Its has simple menu and not so expensive.
030758836X|5.0|This was a great book to just curl up with,in a quiet place.I could not believe that it ended the way that it ended.In fact,I expected a sequel.However,this author has a pool of reference that really displays the darkness of the inner mind of some.I could not wait to be so far down the list,at the library,to get this book,having heard about how terrific it was.So,I got the audio version from Amazon.com.and it worked out great,because it came,by mail,within 4-5 days,and I was taking an auto trip..fabulous to listen to this book.My daughter read the book,and told me that she could not put it down,so she stayed up,half of the night.Terrific!
B0091X36GC|5.0|This is so very good.  What a cast!  I love it so much.  I have seen it 10 times at least.  Johnny Quid is great when he says &#34; Daddy&#34;-&#34;Nice wheels&#34;.  I fall out of my chair laughing.
B00B9ZBZ2C|4.0|I just purchased this book for my brother...I read it quite some time ago and have forgotten all the details...what I do remember though, is that this book was a page turner...one of those books that you just don't want to put down...I may not remember the details but I remember how this book made me feel...like I was on a thrilling chase...that's why when my brother asked me to send him a good book, I automatically thought of &#34;Child 44&#34;.
B009CFZLK8|5.0|This is the first Bourne movie.  It is unique; definitely the best of the three. Matt Damon was perfectly cast. Well written, great screenplay, outstanding direction and acting.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This Blu Ray collection is worth every penny. Video and audio transfer is very good. I highly recommend it. 5 stars all the way!
B008Y778ZG|4.0|Roland E. on a roll! He had so many big screen/huge budget movies going for a while.  This one is plausible, but is missing something.  He will never top Das Boot.  I strongly suggest you watch it in German, but subtitled in English-definitely. A true story, I believe.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|I give this 3 stars as it is middle of the pack compared to other very good literature of this our era.  King has excellent characterization.  A surprisingly touching love story.
B009CG23TO|4.0|This is much better than the second movie in the Jason Bourne trilogy, but not as good as the first.  I like how it ends. It is clever how  The Bourne Identity with Jeremy Renner picks up where Matt Damon ends.  But that is another movie.  &#34;The Hurt Locker&#34; (2008)with Jeremy Renner blew me away; a pun, sorry. That is Jeremy Renner's best movie by far. For what its worth, he won an Oscar in that role.  Matt Damon quit the Jason Bourne movies at the right time.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|this show is the best show i have ever seen. it is so funny I really enjoyed watching it. cant wait to the next season.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Oh this is a good one.  I do not want to spoil anything about it.  Tom Cruise is a badass, and is on a mission.  He is extremely clever as well.  It is a non stop thriller.
1401937519|5.0|This is the only valid book on NDE that I have ever read.  She has nailed it and I appreciate her honesty
B00A9X7X6C|3.0|It is a very clever plot.  I don't think they pulled off the Joseph Gordon-Levitt/Bruce Willis deal. Even with all the makeup, it still just doesn't work.<br /><br />That said, I liked the movie because it showed the versatility of Emily Blunt; especially after &#34;The Adjustment Bureau&#34; with her and Matt Damon.  A terrific movie as well.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Okay, this movie is just pure gold. GOLD I TELL YOU! But for real, the whole point (yeah right) of me owning this movie was to see the dang gag reel! The 2009 film's gag reel was brilliant, what with Quinto and Pine attempting (terribly on Pine's part) accents. I want more gag reel! They could have at least included Simon Pegg's prank he pulled on everyone. I mean COME ON.<br /><br />But the film itself, this deserves to be on every single movie shelf or whatever you use to store brilliant cinema. Benedict Cumberbatch shows us that he's not just a good guy, he's more than just Sherlock Holmes. He can be a bad guy, and a friggin good one. Which only adds to the amazing performances given by the usual cast of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin and Carl Urban. They really are the finest crew in Starfleet, and belong in your homes, and most importantly in your DVD/Blu Ray players. At all times. Always. Forever. Just buy this.
B008VZAJWK|5.0|My god this is a thrilling film. Excellent cast, extremely well played.  Won four Oscars - deservedly so.  I didn't see it until five years after it was released-my loss.  A must-see.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|To watch the entire season and get to see Rose back with the Doctor...but not only Rose. The entire crew comes back for one final stand against Davros and the Daleks. My goodness, if you like Doctor Who at all, you need this. You need this and you need it now. Actually, you need all of the seasons because the 50th anniversary is coming up soon, and you need to rewatch every little thing that has ever gone on. Especially because we know how Steven Moffat works. He'll bring back stuff you've forgotten about. So don't forget a thing, and buy this season and every season.<br /><br />Because you want to.<br />No.<br />Because you need to.
B00F91H666|2.0|Almost every movie that comes out today is either:<br /><br />A.  Apocalyptic<br /><br />B.  Has vampires in it<br /><br />C.  Has zombies in it<br /><br />This one has ALL 3!!!  I am a BIG fan of Brad Pitt-He is not just some good looking guy; he was just in a bad movie.  If not for him,  I would have given it one star.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Must watch if you love music music music.  Very cool how all the artist got together to rock out. And Paul too
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|I think this is okay.  Not bad, not good - JUST OKAY, like I starred it.  I like the way it starts;  I really like it when they go to the factory;  I really do not like how the screenwriter tries to intertwine it with Jason Bourne-it doesn't work.  See Jeremy Renner in &#34;The Hurt Locker&#34;.  A much better movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It's amazing how one choice can completely change the course of your life. Excellent read!
B00BYH6OJO|3.0|I thought this was fair.  I wouldn't see it more than once or twice;  it just seems to be missing something I can't put my finger on.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is a gem.  Real stories about real people finding out how the Universe works!  I'm telling everyone I know to get this book!
B009CFZGFI|3.0|I thought they really missed the mark in this one.  It's definitely the worst of the three Jason Bourne movies.  It concentrates TOO much on his obsession with reconciling the bad things he has done.  That is the director's fault, pure and simple.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Not the best but worth watching for the un-dead people.  Pretty neat effects.  Dialogue was hard to hear at times.
B006ISJQBC|5.0|It is GREAT to see William Monahan finally direct a movie, after so many great screenplays.  Colin Farrell, Keira Knightly, Ray Winstone, David Thewlis and Anna Friel (&#34;I haven't been drinking&#34;) are fantastic. It is perfect.  I wouldn't change a hair in it. The soundtract is to die for.  Every song they play came out when I was a young teenager.  I love it, I love it.  DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!
B0046B6X1E|3.0|I watched this classic after I saw a remake was slated to be released soon and I wanted to have the original fresh in my mind. I had forgotten that so many &#34;stars in the making&#34; were in this movie. As fits with it's age it is short on special effects and the ones that are there are pretty bad. It was a fun walk down memory lane but certainly not the most nail bitting edge of your chair movie I have ever seen.
B00A0SMTXS|2.0|My favorite actor, Clin Farrell just doesn't work in this movie.  It get's worse, and worse and the final 15 minutes are unbearable.  A stinker.  I liked the original version better, and that isn't saying much.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|We watched this just for the fun of it. It will never be a classic nor will it be in anyone's top ten list of best adventure movies ever made but it made for a relaxing evening of action. The story is based on the book by the same name. The actors were solid but not great (they are kids after all). I would sum it up as a fun movie.
B000TERK14|5.0|One of the best albums ever! I can listen to it over and over! 30 seconds to best is one if the greatest bands around
B001NLL93W|5.0|These books are quite simply the best series I've read. I literally couldn't put them down. I know they are technically YA books, but the themes and how they are handled are quite complex. The character development is so very spot on you feel like your best friends with the character. This whole series is a DO NOT MISS OUT ON.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I could not bring myself to give it four stars, even though the 1st season was better. The introduction of political celebrities is interesting but seems somehow &#34;attention-seeking&#34;. The character of &#34;Jackie&#34; (played by Mary Beth Peil) is evolving in an interesting way, or at least being revealed more. I dislike her, as she strikes the pose of Republican-type snobbery. The introduction of the characters &#34;Eli Gold&#34; (played by the diverse Alan Cumming) and &#34;David Lee&#34; (played by Zach Griener) are wonderful!  &#34;David Lee&#34; is absolutely hysterical, though not purposefully!  Christine Baranski as &#34;Diane Lockhart&#34; is fabulous! Her role seems expanded in this season. The more scenes she is in the better! Her style is different from the other attorneys, which is awesome. I did not find all the court cases as interesting this season. Seeing more & more of Archie Panjabi, (playing &#34;Kalinda Shama&#34;) is fascinating, as you learn she holds such mystery, but maintains this penetrating  presence, great abilities, super investigative skills, using what she has as a woman, a woman of color & her innate attractiveness.  &#34;Cary Agos&#34; (played by Matt Czuchry) is a conundrum.  I always see him as a &#34;snake in the grass&#34;, but he turns constantly. Whose side is he really on? I am never quite sure if he will do the right thing or stab people in the back. The complexities in the characters is a lot to absorb. Thought provoking none-the-less.  I see Emmy award winning performances, especially with Baranski and Panjabi.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I really think they could of done a better job with the movie missed a lot of key points in the story and was ramped up too fast.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Seems a rather inadequate follow-up to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Odd to see Elrond and Galadriel looking much older than they did in the Ring Trilogy, although that is understandable given the order in which the films were made. The second disc showed a too-fast tour of cast and productions personnel making brief comments, but showing little of what they were actually doing. Of course much of the interesting demonstrations and explanations of how sets, costumes, implements, etc.were made were extremely well-done in the Ring Trilogy. In the Hobbit it seems like the production was just glossed-over in order to just throw something out there. Maybe I need to watch the whole thing again - see if I come away with more than a ho-hum feeling.
030758836X|4.0|This was definitely a page-turning mystery.  I read it while on vacation and could hardly put it down.  It was difficult to anticipate what would occur next--just what I want in a mystery.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Basil Fawlty is rude, misanthropic, snobbish, miserly and likable in the strangest way possible. His domineering wife spends most of her free time on the phone, his waiter from Barcelona only knows a handful of English words and Polly, although highly intelligent, cannot always keep the hotel running smoothly. Through sheer cunning Basil, with Polly's assistance, can conceal the truth from his wife for the better portion of the series. In the end his lies are discovered and he ends up worse off than when he began. In the interim he spits venom at sometimes deserving targets, interacts with the senile Major and tries to manage Manuel. The plots are always tightly knit and the acting is superb. Also, for an American viewer the various British accents featured in the series add another layer of humor.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This is a great game but moves slow at times. You can speed up the game if you're willing to spend real money. The in-game purchases are expensive! The largest bundle is 99 dollars! You can buy a Kindle for that price!
1446249182|5.0|I'm finishing a Masters degree in the statistical sciences as they relate to psychology in prep for a doctoral program.  I liked the book because it was more accessible than the Tabachnick text (although Tabachnick offers syntax where Field does not), and also more accessible than Warner.  The only way to study statistics is with three to six textbooks on the topic at once so that the student can paint a picture.  I always started with Field's book here before evaluating what the other stats bricks had to offer.  If you're a parent or a student the following sentence may seem like more of a death sentence than the fact that somebody is taking Statistics, however...  It's worth it to spend $400-500 extra on stats books for one course like Multivariate Stats so that you don't have to waste your time scratching your head.  This is one for a Multivariate course you're going to want to have on the shelf.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|After watching the first season you just want moore.  Great series hope the next ones are as good looking forward to them
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Excellent graphics, easy to use controls, and smooth game play make this game a winner in the world of mediocre driving games. It is just hard enough to challenge you, while easy enough to learn quickly.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This movie brings to our eyes the tragedy of the Tsunami. Naomi Watts was wonderful. The kids were great. A very tense experience to watch; the special effects were superb.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This remake of Judge Dredd is true to the original comic from 2000 A.D., I loved it! Dredd is cold, cynical, professional and brutal - the character we grew to love as a guilty, violent pleasure as kids.<br /><br />This movie was done badly the first time round with Sylvester Stallone, including the cardinal sin of removing his helmet and making him into a cheesy character. Dredd is not a deep character, the comics only portrayed him in one dimension, as a faceless symbol of by necessity brutal, hard-bitten law enforcement officers in a grim future world - yet a man apart with his own legend and identity. Dredd is flawed, and Karl urban plays him to perfection, with surprising nuances in his performance. He brings to life a character that hints at something beyond the limited range one would anticipate from a man hiding deliberately behind a helmet - and brings us \\"The\\" Judge Dredd. His voice, movement, gesture and gravitas tell us all we need to know - it's a superb performance. He is Dredd.<br /><br />Dredd's  sidekick provides the emotional outlet, with a relatable, vulnerable character learning to cope and survive in a raw, gritty world. She is human with strong emotional motivation, yet she becomes a bad-ass judge as the movie reaches its conclusion.<br /><br />The villain is played to perfection - cold, cruel, ruthless and utterly callous. I would compare the movie to Die Hard and (maybe more so) Robocop as a Bad Ass cop movie, and it goes down in my Hall Of Fame for being a superb action movie with fantastic characters with a tense, totally bad ass story line.<br /><br />I've forgotten the Stallone version of the film, which was embarrassing (Love The Expendables, so all is forgiven ;) - this is The Dredd movie we always wanted.<br /><br />I hope we have part 2 in the works, I loved it and will see it again.<br /><br />Buy it on Blu-Ray, you'll love it.
B00E193TM2|1.0|I don't understand the massive appeal that this band has.  I have listened to all of their albums and they all sound the same...They are the Nickelback of Hard Rock.  And they come across as a bunch of douchebags.  Years from now when this band is playing the State Fair scene, this era will be known as Bro-core.  And just because they are popular, doesn't mean they are good...I.E.-Justin Bieber, One Direction, Miley Cyrus.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to embrace Janelle! This album is a pleasant surprise. I enjoy every track!
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|I like this book since it has rejuvenated my potentiality deep in my mind. Now at the age of 62, I am on my new path in life. Dr Joseph Murphy has really contributed a lot to this planet.
B002KCYIEA|2.0|The movie had no story line and was no Fatal Attraction.<br />In Fatal Attraction, something really happened between the two leads.<br />In this story, nothing happened, so it's just about a crazy woman who manages to get keys to cars and houses?? Who is she, the CIA???<br />Idris Elba is a truly good actor, although in this movie he had no one to play against.  Beyonc&eacute; is a vacant actress, and the Ali Larter character was ridiculously one dimensional.<br />In real life, the husband would have either had sex with this crazy person or reported her to HR and told his wife about it.<br />But then, you wouldn't have had a bad movie, would you??
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this PBS Television series! Catching up on this series and watching it in HD on my laptop is terrific.
B002MFX0RQ|4.0|I bought this for my 86 year old mother . She really liked it and has watched it  several times. She said it is very funny.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|This was a really great movie. Several scenes actually made us jump. Read the reviews of 1 1/2 stars but was doubtful, i'm so glad I was!!!
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This is my  second DVD as the first became unable to view.  I watch is every so often. Loved the movie
9382951008|5.0|My sister loves this author and was waiting for this book to come out.  She lives about a 1000 miles from me so it was great that I could surprise her with it for her birthday.  She was so happy which made me happy.  Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Do not buy Madden25 it a game called God craft get this game instead<br />Elsewhere macho is fat and minion beach is awsome
0307120007|5.0|This is a classic children's book and essential reading for toddlers. Gave it to a special little boy recently and he is still playing peek-a-boo with it. Great fulfillment by seller too!
1848549245|5.0|This book was life changing for me.  I have given a copy to several people and would recommend it a read for everyone.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was a selection for my book club...a group of retired professional women.  We loved it.  Although the first 40 pages are slow going (just like a library), it becomes a page turner pretty quickly.  I really enjoyed the peak inside the Silicon Valley culture of Google, and including a cult-like mystery was fun.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hey well i really dont like thus app the other the other one was way better i agree with the other diappointed rewiew sorry
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Very good show and entertaining. A show highlighting adventure of a young kid and his encounter with a mysterious man.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gairman in this lovely story gives us what we all truly know in the deepest part of our heart and soul, but have such difficulty remembering. In its own way it is the journey we took when we were little and truly knew we lived in not an imaginary world as adults suggested, but rather in the world between worlds that carried all the wonder and terror of our inner experience . This is the first book I've read of Gariman's and I look forward to reading more.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have created so far three profiles because I play against myself just to try to make more and more points on each game.  Wonderful scenes, colors and the different tile sets can be challenging.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun time waster. The more you play, the more stuff there is to keep you guessing and entertained. be sure to go for the prizes that add extra dimensions of play. I also like running out of coins because then I know it's time to get back to work.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Now, let me say something that might put a smile on you.  I am a 48 year old grandma!  My husband is 66 & we absolutely love Ben... Its funny, entertaining, hilarious.  We look like 2 I don't know what laughing specially in the talking back feature. Kids would have a blast.
6304602944|3.0|A small film to just laugh at the naïvet&eacute; and superficiality of action films. But it is a good think to laugh from time to time. The only serious thing is that the police in Los Angeles, LAPD as well as FBI, is rotten to the core of the core, the heart of the heart, soul, mind and brain, and even probably the tripe and the gut. But that is no secret and it is not close to changing in the near future.<br /><br />The two cops are heroes, then framed, then thrown into prison among the criminals they have managed to send to prison, then they escape, then they clean themselves up and destroy a whole drug cartel, and finally they are heroes again.<br /><br />The action is both spectacular and not too expensive. It is a film for teenagers, teeny boppers if I can say so, in the summer or something like that. Parents can sleep peacefully, there is nothing that can be seen as or said to be in anyway off the straight line of don't ask don't tell don't say don't do and any other don't you may think of.<br /><br />Enjoy the trip into mentally-challenged Hollywood productions, where big wheels means little brains<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This has become my bast tool on my Kindle Fire.  It's big numbers and the fact that it is free has combined to make it a most have on your pad if you work a lot with numbers.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Was a very entertaining movie and plays to Jim Carey's prevail brand of comedic abilities. Overall entertaining movie for most of the family.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Fun, time consuming great when at appointments and beautiful scenes.  I love match three games so this is perfect for me. ... .... ....
B0041KVZ18|1.0|Bought as a gift for a friend...found out months later that there were numerous stickers on the actual album cover that didn't come off w/o damaging the cover...yeah, i know, it is a plain white cover...but still.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is wonderful for those that love enigmas.  I'm not much into it but play it once in a while.  .... ... ...
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My children love all the new things that are in this version. They begged for me to load it and they love it.
B0064Z7RXS|5.0|This is the album that should define this often underrated and simultaneously overrated band. Bill Corgan tapped into the visceral nature of aggressive alternative rock and showed its humanity in the quiet often understated moments. The actual \\"sound\\" of this record is telling canvas for the 90's alt rock template so many less talented bands tried to steal. The hits on this album are timeless songs of bitter sweet longing, regret, awkward potential and sarcastic wish fulfillment. Corgan has always been an underrated guitar player who reaches his apex with Iha on this album. Despite their well known personal and creative tension, they have created an auditory landscape that makes Siamese Dream one of the landmark albums of the 90's and for alt rock to come. You can see how Silversun pickups used this album as a creative influence. Other quality bands and some of differing quality have also leaned heavily upon this album. Its a beautiful testament to a moment where popular music decided to be about something. And not about collecting something. This is what music should be.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is such a great show. My husband even enjoys watching it with me. I get sucked into every episode!  I love watching Alicia Florrick find her inner strength and rise up to be what her family needs after her husband is put into prison. Great show!
B000I0XLYO|3.0|I'm not usually one who enjoys dumb / inane comedies. Not surprisingly, I didn't enjoy this film. It didn't connect with me at all.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|After reading it and understanding how to grow and get stronger slowly ; I aplied all the techniqes that Michael explains here and it really made a difference in my workouts, more powerful, intense and shorter . Of course increasing my calories accordingly to gain a few extra pounds of lean muscle . I Really recomend anything coming from Michael  !!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I became attached to these characters immediately.  Gritty & exciting.  I couldn't stop after episode 1.  A great binge watch!
B004LWZW42|4.0|great movie to watch over and over. great action and great actors just a grat movie to watch!!! over and out Acezhigh13
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl write clearly about the work/life challenges that women in the 21st century face. She offers great new insight and ideas on how to overcome these challenges.  Great book for discussion and/or leisure reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome because you can play more than at least 5 players at a time. This game is awesome and it's totally worth the 7 dollars.  My name is Nathanael to I just wanted to say that cause I don't now any body who has the name Nathanael and I think that is awesome.
B003U53GK8|3.0|I felt the story line was getting stretched in this. I loved the earlier seasons, but sort of lost interest. However, I did want to find out how it ended. Amazon lets me do that - and without commercials too!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|They'll love the second season. And looks like a 3rd season is in the works This could go a few seasons more from the looks of it. As far as fantasy show's this is in the Top 3 or 5 for some. My wife loves it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|For drama, plot twists and interpersonal relationship stresses The Good Wife is a &#34;can't wait to watch the next episode&#34; type of show. The characters are so richly scripted that you feel like you know them personally after just one episode. You will indulge yourself with two or three episodes in a row without even coming up for air.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Loved the plot. Good twist at the end kept me on the edge of my seat. Recommend everyone to view
B008JFUOVI|1.0|After Todd Philipps witnessed success with the first film he and the studios quickly realized they had a money maker on their hands. Ever since then these movies have been pushed out as fast as possible producing 3 films in only 4 years.<br /><br />This is an unfortunate ingredient for failure. When a movie is not given a proper amount of time to be developed in the writing and plotting stage it can easily suffer from any number of things. First off the film is supposed to be a comedy and while the first brought the laughs by the barrel this one could hardly muster an occasional chuckle.<br /><br />Chow was an initial fan favorite but I feel at this point they've abused his power of being a good side character by bringing him too far into the spot light. I think to an extent the same thing happened with Galifianakis, he became such a cult figure after the first movie, it's almost like they gave him the headline in this movie, which goes against what made the first film great.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Loved the action and plot. Nail biting suspense. Brad Pitt was great. Will read the book. Great scfi action movie
B001SZ8Y72|5.0|This film is great, quirky, offbeat, intelligent fun. If that's your cup up tea, then I highly recommend that you see it.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|Good plot and action. Nick cage was great. Can't wait for the sequel. Recommend to my friends looking for action.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|if you're an avid reader, you know well enough that its hard to come by a really good book. but every few years, one does usually come along and blow your socks off. this is one of them. a page turner, totally addictive. the author has managed to draw you into his life and world and make you feel like you're a part of it. would definitely recommend to everyone.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I didn't like this as much as i thought i would. more for litter kids not my aged adults. just wasn't for my!!
B000FBJGKO|2.0|was long and a bit draggy. wouldn't really recommend. the idea was good but a little bland. not a page turner.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This was a dynamite season. So much happened. It was fast moving drug trade wise (lots of changes) and relationship wise for both Walt and Jesse with their significant others as well as their own relationship. Hank was involved in a big way; Saul, Hector and Mike were introduced and it ended with a surprising death. Addictive!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is awesome and very comparable to \\"pro\\" models.  I love that it doesn't have a camera specific logo on it, so I can take it out and no one knows it is full of expensive equipment.  The dividers can be customized so I am able to carry two pro model cameras, 4 lenses, all my cards, a flash and triggers.  Plus there are a lot more room left on the outside pockets.
0670014893|3.0|Not at his best. sort of rambles on and am having trouble finishing it. Of course it is<br />a hardback and I prefer my Kindle!
B005COO1X6|4.0|People that like Stephen King. My Daughter and granddaughter. It sure kept you reading . I did not want to stop till l was finished.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app literally saved my life. Our next door neighbor's dog barks incessantly through the night, usually waking us between 2 and 3 in the morning. The barking obviously doesn't bother him and when it's been pointed out, says he can't do anything about it. We have tried everything from moving to a different bedroom to purchasing a electronic device to deter barking (don't waste your money). Short of a gun or legal action (futile since he's a lawyer) we purchased this app. Now we can't hear her incessant barking and can sleep through the night. Wonderful!!! Would have given 5 stars but almost never rate any product or service perfect. There is always room for improvement.
B00BMCAM6M|2.0|Haven't had the time to get to understand it. Hopefully I can by Christmas and be jamming LOVE music!  Have to have my music.
0385523394|5.0|I was drawn to the show first, but upon finding out there was a book, I had to read it first. I ordered it in &#34;Good&#34; condition, and the book came to me, ahead of schedule, and it looked brand-spankin'-new! The book is better than the show, of course. And now I feel like I could survive in a women's prison!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Pretty good , maybe one mistake ....it's not necessarily good for you to put a bad review its ridiculous the way some people rate apps because &quot; ONE &quot; problem . Not cool.
1594202842|5.0|BMOTTM is not about some psychotic Asian mother hell-bent on destroying her daughters' good times during their childhood. It's about a mother of Asian decent that had to fight tooth and nail every inch of the way to give her offspring the best possible launch into adulthood. It's inspirational. It's messy. It's wonderful. It's my guide to successful parenting. Amy Chua is the only woman on this planet that I could possibly want to replace my own mother's attitude with- maybe. She is strict, strong, and her daughters benefited greatly from her parenting techniques. I don't think I can say enough about how awesome this book is, and I'm afraid that she will email me a message (&#34;This review was terrible, you've disgraced my book!&#34;), she's basically the Gordon Ramsay of mothers, but prettier.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed book two!!! It keeps you on your toes and wanting more!!! I highly recommend this book to those that enjoy romance with a kick!!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|More twists, less illness storyline, made this season more enjoyable for me than season one. looking forward to a new adventure
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this game better than the first I thank you should play it and give a rating.Ps  don't join the Bork side pleas.<br /><br />.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game because it is never boring. Every puzzle is different and challenging. Great way to spend idle time waiting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 8 year old and 5 year old love this game. This is a review from my 8 year old daughter:  You have to jump over things and run and it's kind of like subway surf. It 's fun and the minions are funny.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|This movie is a fast paced thriller that puts a new spin on a classic concept. The story takes Pitt's character all over the world, a refreshing detour from the normal route that follows a single group or family through their run-ins with the zombie hordes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book yet of the Heroes of Olympus with the mother of all cliff hangers. We meet new characters and see new gadgets and great villans. The next book better come out quick!,
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I definitely don't qualify for young adult or teenager anymore, but on occasion I do like to read novels for teenagers or young adults. I like to entertain the kid in me, but that does only work if the book in question displays certain characteristics, such as wit and charm. Also, the characters need to develop depth, they and the story need to be treated with respect. I cannot wait for the next book in this series. The quality of the writing makes it a joy to read not only for the younger crowd, but also for more &#34;mature&#34; readers.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Entertaining film if you like zombie movies!  Was concerned because didn't seem to have great reviews but found it entertaining.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes stories that get into the head of the characters and see how the movement of the story affects them. The acting was superb. The action is slow. You really start to feel sorry for the boy Ellis as he comes to terms with what's going on around him. It's not a high action movie, and it doesn't have much of a plot - it's quite predictable. I agreed with another reviewer who was disappointed in the ending. I also am not fond of having sexual comments being delivered by 12-14 year old boys. In short, if you want a soft, quiet drama that tries to speak to the heart, you will enjoy this movie. If you want more action and plot twists, look elsewhere.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved the way the author used 3 voices to describe the heroine's journey to finding her personal story.  It was a very interesting read.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This game is slow to load.  It has decent graphics, interesting scenes.  There is no avoiding the charge for the full game.  These games should be advertised as a trial
B001XITTHI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book when it first came out in print.  Stephen King is one of my few favorite and reliable authors.  I also have a weakness for popup books.  This one is completely delightful while staying true to the original story.  The scenes are well constructed and entertaining.  They also easily fold back down as the page is turned... a key element in being pleased with a popup book.  I don't think there were many of these made.  So I feel almost privileged to own one.
0307743721|5.0|I've always found Alice Munro's stories engaging and look forward to whatever new she writes.  I've picked one of the stories, &#34;To Reach Japan,&#34; for discussion at the next meeting of the reader's group I belong to.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|This movie is really great and the blu ray experience is really great. The movie has been restored and looks really great. You will enjoy the new look.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a well-crafted movie that keeps the attention despite its length. It causes one to think, and that, for me, is one of the most important things a film can do.

B0089LOG02|5.0|A WELL written novel about the parallel experiences two women faced in their journey of life.  Never boring at all.
B008133MDK|5.0|I had never seen the British new Sherlock Holmes before getting access to it on Amazon Prime.  It is so amazingly well done. The stories are interesting, the production values are amazing.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Great for adults and kids!  Graphics are unbelievable and storyline is so adorable.  Keeps kids interested and adults as well.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|In any great Western there's almost always a call to \\"hang `em high.\\" In the case of John Carter, Disney's 2012 spaghetti western science experiment that call came too soon for the legions of now unemployed production and marketing staff who brought this overwrought and under thought budget busting  sci-fi-western-fantasy-romance-unintentional comedy to our midst only to see it subjected to a fusillade of critical pounding and countless empty theaters.<br /><br />Originally envisioned as a franchise for the studio with two sequels already planned, those plans were immediately scuttled as Carter's Martian adventure brought with it an extraterrestrial write-down of $175 million for the Mouse House.<br /><br />To be fair, I have to admit a rather perverse fascination for films that by any objective measure - really suck. Not films that started with an interesting premise but wound up sabotaged by a bit of odd casting and leaden acting (Waterworld?) but productions that failed dismally through self-inflicted head shots at every stage of development from concept, production, continuity and marketing.<br /><br />Within a ridiculous, convoluted miasma of Peckinpaugh meets Leone meets Lucas meets Roddenberry meets Spielberg meets The Princess Bride, John Carter had no chance to ever present a cohesive storyline. Born on earth in the early 19th century, incomprehensively transported to Mars and thrust into their civil war all while beguiling a sullen princess who is promised in marriage to an enemy overlord.<br /><br />In this deep space muddle, the required suspension of disbelief is never the problem, it is the suspension of belief that always intrudes on the film through absurd dialogue, nonsensical plot twists and action sequences that would make a video game programmer wince. My only salvation being the $30 multiplex ransom saved by viewing this mess on cable rather than in a deserted theater. Tough stuff from beginning to end.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Pretty good thriller with a little twist on how long it takes for a victim to become a Zombie.  Otherwise, just basic story line on hero saving the day at the risk of his life.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|The game itself was okay, but that is when I could get it to actually play! Kept freezing so much that I uninstalled it the first day.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|I love magic movies and this one was very complex.  Good acting with great sets and scenes.  You'll love the end because you will find out who the hooded mystery person is at the very end of the movie and you'll probably be surprised.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I kept trying to download and install it, but it always showed it being downloaded, then it was no where to be found in order to install it. How is the game....I wouldn't know.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Didn't want to review this until I'd had a least 3 full listens and still plan to respond again after many more on this show. At this point it truly ranks up this as a great one. Top 3, top 5, top 10 surely in most minds, you'll need to decide, but it is a great set list, a great sound quality, great playin and the dead at their relaxed best. You can truly feel their love for this event to the point it almost feels they were playin at family barbecue, which in reality is was. Watching the DVD gives you the full feeling that this was an event with no security, nothing barred and the dead in full trust that the group could self-manage themselves. This was still the Dead evolving to the place that would grip a far wider audience and still the dead before they were so big that the machine started to chip away at their ability to produce consistent great shows. Workingmans Dead and American Beauty vaulted the dead to new highs musically and 72 was the year where they melded these tunes into concert mega shows.<br />At this point, I still have 5/11/72 Holland as my # 1 show from this year. It had it all and the sound is just a little crisper than the heat impaired, at times Veneta show. Keep in mind though that these comparisons are nit picking as both are fabulous. The point is if you need more Dead in you life, this is absolutely a no brainer.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Good watch for both Star Trek fans and fon-Trekies because the movie has suspense, action, good characters, and lots of good visuals.  Abrams did a super job.  Loved how the storyline was presented. Can't say more because I don't want to give the plot away.
B004R10N6O|5.0|The change in the life of one high school person by another is a living testimony about what living for Jesus can do. She never stopped praying for him and believing in him
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is terrifc as the 16th President. If you love history, you will want to watch Lincoln. The film is entirely about President Lincoln's effort, struggle and negotiations regarding emancipation. The actor is excellent and the movie score is rich. Understanding realism was important for the film makers, the only negative I have is that most of this film was shot with poor lighting.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|This is a harder version of solitaire but once you master the formula, you will love it for the challenge in figuring out how to shift things around to end up with a win.
B006JPML7K|4.0|This sequel to Kung Fu Panda is a very entertaining family film. We really enjoyed watching this one. The film continues the avdenture where the first one left off. Jack Black's character is both funny and loving. We cant wait for the third release of this series.
B005HGKWLO|3.0|It is the Hollywood version of trivia content and there is no mystery as to how it is going to end.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So many sounds to choose from and combine! I am enjoying trying out different combinations, and find this a very relaxing way to end the day and fall asleep. Many thanks!
B0000DJYQQ|5.0|A huge Rolling Stones fan, bought this for my old man for Father's Day, obviously he loved it.  Highly recommended.
B005544TRQ|4.0|A cross between LA Law and The Practice with a touch of comedy.  If you enjoy watching a TV show about &#34;the smartest guys in the room&#34;, this could be your show.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Gone to the Khan well, one to many times. Kinda like they got 3/4 of the way through a movie, realized they didn't have an ending, so stole and rewrote (badly)the ending from one of the franchise's classics. Too many momentary shots of corny looking alien characters, in make-up, appearing to be inspired partially from Mary Poppins, and part from the Star Wars cantina scene. Special effects weren't so well executed and what the story line lacked in comprehension, it failed to compensate for with a nervous urgency to move on to the next action sequence. The token homage to the original cast, by incorporating \\"original timeline Spock\\" into the story is really lame and cliche now, as it was the first time. Not much here to recommend, except the Spock & Bones characterizations, capture the original series portrayals, pretty well, while updating themselves, into their roles a bit. The rest of it, not so much. Like the Bond movies, Beatles tribute bands and Twinkies, these brands are reaching the end of their use by dates. Great in their day, but you had to be there to understand what the electricity was all about, and it's difficult to recapture that, at this later timeline.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As many others have said, reminds me of the Myst days, and hours in front of the old PC.  Well worth the money, cannot wait for the sequel.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have read every one and am sad for this adventure to end, however, Charlaine Harris did a great job of bringing it all together!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome. I would very highly reccomend this app because its great for if your friends have it because you can play multiplayer and if they have an ipod or iphone you can still do it with them.
B00E687MWQ|5.0|To keep it short, this album exceeded all my expectations. Everything about it is pure Satyricon perfection. The song structure and production are all that Satyr said it would be. This album just delivers on so many levels and is truly worthy of being titled Satyricon.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|I searched for this film because I just loved it when I was younger. I watch it over and over again.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|enjoyed this book, it was a fun read keeping your mind off of daily stresses.  good clean book to read
159463176X|4.0|If Verdi was alive, he would have a feast. There is the father-daughter duet, several arias; a few soprano-mezzo  duets; a couple of trios, chorals and even a quartet that could be found somewhere.<br /><br />While I was reading this book, I never ceased to be amazed by Hosseini talent. I pondered about Khaled Hosseini's greatest sin: his huge popularity. \\"How unfair is for the snobs to dismiss Hosseini!\\", I kept telling myself. American bestsellers authors often write the same book over and over again. It is just not right to put him in the same category as Dan Brown or Robin Cook.<br /><br />Hosseini so far wrote three books and each one has a different take on his universal topics: War, (In)justice, family, sacrifices, immigration, roots, Islamic culture, (bad) choices, extreme sadness come to mind. The wonderful \\"The Kite Runner\\" was the kickoff. Then we had the perhaps-even-more-wonderful, the Stephen King-esque \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and now this \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\", which is structurally quite unlike its predecessors.<br /><br />I read some of the one star reviews and I cannot feel anything but embarrassed by some comments. People whose deepest book ever read was \\"The Kite Runner\\" complained that they couldn't follow the story and had trouble figuring out where the action was taken place. It just tells me how little the mass market paperback authors ask from their readers.<br /><br />Towards the last third part of the book is where I started to feel the techniques of the bestseller author. I reckoned that the manipulation was over the top and my excitement cooled down a little bit.  Nevertheless it was a great reading.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|Love the CD....just about every cut....a few not so sure...all in all....very enjoyable.  I'm sharing with all my friends....they love her too!  Saw her on PBS special.....wow....very special artist.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Really like the blue-ray and new effects. In my opinion this is how Star Trek was suppose to look like when it was on TV.
0062202081|5.0|ive always been a belieber since day One in 2009 so i already know all his info but this book is great!!
0385742886|5.0|12 year old son to 48 year old husband. What's not to like about this great entertainment value? Read the series. Wonderful
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|One of the best games ever I cannot believe the graphics and the awesome cars put on there is nothing bad about this game and recommend it for everybody that wants to get it.
B00CNEVHMG|5.0|This album i remember hearing when i was about 12 yrs old and i guess its the only one that i like.<br />I had never heard a voice as brilliant as jon anderson's before and rick wakeman's keyboard truly<br />amazing,and with the brilliant drums from alan white and chris squire's bass,again they were<br />musicians very different to what i was listening to at the time(mainly top 40 charts).<br />Five great tracks with (turn of the century)and (awaken)being a touch of class.<br />I also found the album cover,and the inside cover just so good to look at while playing the music.<br />After this album i then purchased some more from yes,but this was the best one for me!.<br />Plus steve howe on guitar was the most intricate i had heard at the time of about 1979 when i was<br />given the album to listen to.
1444777556|5.0|I loved the story by James Bowen: &#34;The World According To Bob&#34; from the first sentence to the last.  The story masterfully weaves Bowen's and Bobs lives together where James seems to be the more in need of Bob, than, perhaps Bob of James.  The book is such a delight that it will lift any downcast spirit up of his or her doldrums.  I recommend this book to everybody but especially all cat lovers.
1934030597|3.0|Good book but dated.  Have 2011 Giant Anthem with Elixar disk brakes and no info .Disappointed, bought another copy for a gift .They were disappointed as well.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Lots of action, twists, and parallels to the original movie series. Enjoyed it so much that we watched it 3x during our rental period!!
0761172726|5.0|This is the best calendar!  I have bought this calendar the last 3 years and love it!  So easy to see what each person has every day!  I am a family of 5 and we are super busy so a calendar like this is a necessity!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's a page turner by the master of plot, and also gives an in-depth account of the Kennedy assassination, American culture in the late 50s and early 60s, with fictional characters who are compelling and interesting.  The time travel of a contemporary character back into mid-century America demonstrates all the big and small cultural changes since that time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I originally downloaded this game for my son and one day it was open and I started playing it and I have been hooked ever since.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|What more do you need to know? You'll like the bonus story too. All in all, this is satisfying stuff.
B000002AV5|5.0|This purchase was good. I'm a fan of Sade, so I couldn't go wrong. My Boise makes the music awesome!!
B000XXTCF8|2.0|didn't like the selection of his greatest hits album. he has better songs - but maybe those aren't his greatest hits.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enders Game is a compelling idea that falls short- it's ending is not fully realized and anticlimactic. To go from a first person struggle to a remote synopsis of the rest of the characters lives left me wanting more,  though not in a good way.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This was a FAOTD, but I would gladly pay for it. Suitable for all ages - I'd pit a 3 year old against an adult any day on this one - it's deceptively simple, and a lot of fun. The later levels take really creative multi layered thinking. My one and only complaint is that the replayability is limited for an adult, and there are not enough levels. I'd love to see a sequel.
B0013527I4|5.0|This review is from: The Muppet Show: Season One (DVD)<br />I LOVE the Muppets! Always have and am so very glad to have them on DVD! However, I was extremely disappointed to discover that they are not recorded in order. This may not be a big deal for some people, but if you're going to do something, especially something as special to so many as the Muppet Show, you should do it right.<br />That being said, the Muppets are fantastic and I'd recommend them to anyone of any age. This is the only reason I didn't take away a star for the annoying recording order.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|If you are into solving puzzles then this game is definitely for you.  It captivated me to the very end.
1400062071|4.0|I actually got caught up in this book inspite of the depressing story.  I was taken with the descriptions of nature and how she connected them with the mood of the character.  It was a fast read for me, however when I was recounting the plot to a friend, I couldn't believe I really liked it!  Great character study.
B00936A0ZW|4.0|Paul Gilbert does not disappoint with &#34;Vibrato&#34;. He nails tunes in all genres:  hard rock, blues, jazz, heavy metal, fusion etc..<br />Love the live covers of &#34;Roundabout&#34; and &#34;I Wants to be Loved&#34;. If you appreciate good musicianship pick up this album !
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My son uses this app every night to fall asleep. It calms him and he gets the relaxing night sleep he needs to be refreshed in the morning.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really cute game to get you out of boardam just pop out the the tablet or phone and start playing this game and you be in a chipped mood for the day
B00D5YNQMW|4.0|I saw the band 35 years ago when AC/DC opened for them. Didn't know who they were then but that's another story. Aerosmith came out and butchered the next 90 minutes. This would be when the \\"toxic twins\\" were at their highest high or lowest low...ya know what I mean. Because of that show I have held a grudge and never attended another Aerosmith show since. What a mistake! This disc kicks butt! Yes the interviews are annoying and cutting some songs into snippets is a drag but when they do play....HOLY WOW!!! This band really can put on one helluva show. The audio is fantastic, at some points you actually feel like your in the arena at the show. Feeling the tempo rise up and up with a wee bit of reverb from the building. Fantastic. Great disc.
0439023513|5.0|Incredible! Riviting!  Had a hard time putting it down. Very thought provoking. Makes you thankful you are living in a place where your freedoms are still being  protected. Or are they?
B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham nails another one. You get hooked right from the first page. Fast paced,a real page turner. You won't be disappointed.
1447231104|4.0|After reading book 1 and 2 of the clifton stories, I was not disappointed in the 3rd.  His writing is so spellbinding and it is impossible to anticipate what will happen next.  Archer is  a master of suspense and I cannot believe he doesn't know what he will have his characters doing from one chapter to the next.  I just hope I live long enough to read all the books now that he is going to do seven - I can't wait for #4.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|app won't load anything past the first two or three statuses on the feed, and I'm lucky if I even get to see the pictures on those few statuses.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|To be honest there was not a ton of scenes with the aliens. But over all it was a good movie
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|Love, if ur a Big fan, u will love it, the dvd is awesome too, n nice extras inside. nice
B00CJGP116|5.0|bought the cd for my wife as part of her birthsay present. she's a true fan of marc anthony and loves this cd very much.
0307463745|5.0|This book takes on a lot of the misconceptions of bigger businesses.  With its super easy to read sectioned chapters, the book goes though all the things one should do when starting any company (lots of focus on tech, but can apply to anything).<br /><br />Loved the book and will recommend.
B007XF4J70|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  Nothing needs to be added and taking away any part of the movie would reduce its quality.  Even if you maintain only a small library of physical video media this should be your first/next purchase.<br /><br />My parents were part of the World War II generation so watching the movie, at least a couple times of year, brings back many memories of them.  An amazing era, the greatest generation and wonderful movie.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Like the challenges not enough hints though Wish hints were easier to get .Kind of hard but fun Love it
B00B7Y0206|1.0|You see every time I go to watch a video it takes forever to load and freezes for no reason at all fix this problem and I'll leave a better  review
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Its so fun to read all the captured and clearly articulated nuances of human psychology. What a wonderful story. I look forward to reading it every night!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is very good movie. The acting is great, the action is fantastic. It is big budget zombie flick, but well done. Well worht watching. I cannot wait for a sequel.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|The cases are interesting, but the premise seems a bit much exaggerated. I'm only on second season so I'm wondering where this show will go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So awesome if you like possible but not too easy games you should get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I can't stop playing it is the best!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|This app truly allows us to listen to music according to our preferences, and I didn't give it the 5 starts just because it really shows its worth when you use headphones or good speakers, and isn't &#34;automatic&#34; and requires running it every time you turn on Kindle.
B00ABO573A|4.0|Even being slow and somewhat disjointed at times, it was interesting to watch the relationships unfold and change over time.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch. I didn't think I would like it but it turned out to be fun to watch.  It keeps your interest when you watch certain parts.  I love magic tricks and seeing some of these are a little on the outrageous side but what do you expect when you are watching a movie.  I do like seeing how they try to debunk certain tricks. It's worth a watch
B00CY5Y37U|5.0|Belinda Carlisle fans can rejoice.  Edsel Records has released her second thru fifth solo albums beautifully remastered with tons of essential extras.  And the package that is RUNAWAY HORSES is a gem.  The remastered sound of the original album is enough to make this a worthy buy for me so all the extras just become icing on the cake.  I have honestly never heard remastered material that sounded so good as with the clarity here.  The vocals are crystal clear and with the orchestration you can hear each individual instrument.  The musical track to SUMMER RAIN is mesmerizing.  The music pulls you in.  RUNAWAY HORSES had many hits and stellar album tracks including the title track, VISION OF YOU, LA LUNA, WE WANT THE SAME THING and VALENTINE.  Rock, pop and ballads arte perfectly mixed here.  The first disc has the original album with the single version of 7 songs.  Disc 2 has some amazing song remixes.  My favorites are a LEAVE A LIGHT ON mix and a glorious VISION OF YOU remix.  The third disc is a dvd with an extended interview with Belinda and promo videos on 6 of the songs.<br /><br />All of this comes in a beautiful hardback booklet with 28 glossy pages that includes extensive liner notes on the making of the album plus details on each track and the lyrics.  There are also tons of pictures.  Often when remixes are added to an updated release of an album much of it is filler.  Not the case here.  Every track is a treat and displays Belinda Carlisle and her musical magical gift at its best.  Highly recommended.  RUNAWAY HORSES is an essential part of Belinda's musical history.  Be sure to pick it up while you can.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A very sensitive story. The characters were portrayed in an excellent way. They all put themselves before Lou. She never gave it a second thought. Until Will! He ultimately cared so deeply for her and she for him<br />The main subject is so sensitive and the conclusion is heart wrenching<br /><br />Reading this novel brought me to tears!!
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|I love this movie and now it is even better on Blu-ray.  Great quality  and still my favorite over the new version of The<br />Great Gatsby which was good, but it is just not quite catching the time and era of the book quite like only Redford can do.<br /><br />This is a must see.
B0086449YA|5.0|This is the first of Mr Knopfler's albums I have listened to.  It will not be the last, terrific music.
0060531053|5.0|When you're ready to get serious about home brewing, you need this book. Easy to follow step by step instructions to walk you through your beginning  home brewing experiences. Also, in depth explanations of what is going on and why. Something for the more advanced as well as the beginner.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Now I know why I only have one disc of his.  Not great not bad, he is a singer. Not much more I can say.
B0098C69OM|5.0|Fabulous Chet Baker he has been put down for not doing screech I don't like the screech stuff his notes are airy and right on for a mans voice emotionally deep and I love his style he just makes it his own Miles does not have anything on Chuck, they both play their hearts and I love both of them.  This is great stuff guitar is worth it for a guitar player and the upright bass is fantastic also. My favorite track is Cherokee fabulous version. Chow not a big talker.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Again, another part of our history that there is not enough information credit given to the actual warriors who helped build this country.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|For younger ones just beginning or struggling to learn their ABCs, Alphabet Aquarium is a great app. It utilizes hand-eye coordination and enables children to put letters together in an interactive puzzle format which most young ones have been previously exposed to. Working in three stages, the child pieces together the letter, an animal which starts with the letter, and objects with the letter's sound. A plus is that the child or parent/teacher has the option of with letter they would like to work on so that the child does not get \\"stuck\\" or frustrated if they are struggling. The cute animations and sounds are a bonus as well!
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Wjhat is there to say, such a talented artist.  She takes me to what or where she is singing about.  A true artist with her words and music.
B00BLB6R1S|4.0|It's been 11 years between Poco's last studio effort: \\"Running Horse\\" (2002) and this new one entitled: \\"All Fired Up\\" and in the past decade a few things have happened: George Grantham suffered a stroke and is no longer a part of the band. Paul Cotton, a member of the band since replacing Jim Messina in 1971 has left the band (I don't know any details as to WHY Paul has left) and longtime bass player Jack Sundrud has stepped up in his role in Poco and is writing more and singing a bit differently from the way he was earlier.<br /><br />The new edition of Poco is: Rusty Young and Jack Sundrud joined by George Lawrence on drums and percussion and Michael Webb on keyboards, vocals and a variety of stringed instruments. The sound of the band is very different without Paul Cotton and his guitars not being a part of this. Paul,  always gave Poco a harder edge due to his playing skills as a writer he was very essential as he wrote some big hits and fan favorites for this band that leave with him. George, was an amazing singer and solid drummer and the harmonies aren't as strong without George and Paul.<br /><br />That said the songs found on this one are way better than the material that was selected for \\"Running Horse\\" in 2002. The biggest difference in the songs found on: All Fired Up\\" are Jack's songs as they are some of the best things on this record. The new and improved writing and singing from Jack Sundrud brings this new CD up higher by at least a few notches.<br /><br />The Title track: \\"All Fired Up\\" sounds like it could have found a place on: \\"Pickin' Up The Pieces\\" way back in 1968 as it really has the ol' time Poco feel and fire. Michael Webb contributes: \\"That's What Rock 'N' Roll Will Do\\" with some great saxophone from guest player Bobby Keys that rocks out in good style. \\"Regret\\" is one of those Rusty Young ballads that ooze like honey, \\"Neil Young\\" is about a guy that shares the same last name as Rusty but comes from a different family. \\"Rusty Huddle Stomp\\" is a brisk acoustic instrumental from that will be a showcase at the live gigs to prove just how great R. Young can play anything with strings attached to it.<br /><br />At first play I wasn't sure about this new record from Poco and I still miss Paul Cotton as he and Rusty kept this magicial thing called Poco alive for decades together. But, with more plays on the CD machine this one has really won me over as a migthy fine Poco record. Yes, the band has changed once again but...\\"There's still a little magic in the country!\\"<br />Four Stars!p\\" is a brisk acoustic instrumental from that will be a showcase at the live gigs to prove just how great R. Young can play anything with strings attached to it.<br /><br />At first play I wasn't sure about this new record from Poco and I still miss Paul Cotton as he and Rusty kept this magicial thing called Poco alive for decades together. But, with more plays on the CD machine this one has really won me over as a migthy fine Poco record. Yes, the band has changed once again but...\\"There's still a little magic in the country!\\"<br />Four Stars!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Talented, skilled, and in tune with what the world needs, intellelagent songs about real feelings and life. She does not have to use profanity or slang to get the messages out there.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|I cant put these books down and have recommended them to my friends<br />Fast moving and keeps up the action all the way with the twists and turns
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Just like the Matrix, I had to watch this movie more than one time to better follow. A lot of interesting concepts that are sometimes hard to keep straight when action moving so fast. One of a kind! Whenever I come across a movie I can't predict outcome, I am intrigued...and usually buy it to watch many more times.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|As above it's a great way to spend an evening. worth every penny.  Great for holidays. Perhaps the climate details could be added
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I know the times of volumes 1 & 2 but Follett clears up the historical background by using a continuity of the family stories tied in with facts and fiction. looking forward to number 3
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Well I liked the story line, I am now waiting for Amazon  to send me the next movie then my collection will be complete.
B001OKJXIK|5.0|I love this movie but not sure how to watch it on my computer I tried the other day I have it on my Kindle but would like to watch it on a TV
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|Personally  when I buy one movie i feel the need to get the whole collection. I did not like the fact they changed the girlfriend, but other than that it was good
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|e Love this movie Nic Cage does a great jobe and its a pretty good story what would you do if you could come bak and right the wrong
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Captivating.....Amazing story lines, all strung together like a beautiful symphony. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone,regardless of genre usually watched.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|This game is not for me. To much of a fast pace with the boxing, but my son is crazy about it. I will keep it so he can play when he visit.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this is one of the best games I have played. I love how different tasks together play into a level being completed. after playing the free levels I couldn't help but buy the full game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and generally challenging. I also agree with most other reviews.I don't have anything else to say
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Habit forming. So much fun and can't stop playing. Would like a few more coins to start but otherwise the prizes are cool.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|as I was playing I noticed little blips flashing all over the screen.<br />I didn't like that. other than that it has better graphics and faster animation. looks like a funngame. my kids love angry birds and star wars. so glad they came out with a second.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I like that you can buy( with coins you collect for free) all sorts of stuff and make it cooler.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|Pink tells us in a clear language that there`s hope for the western world in the global world in which we live. It is only a matter of acquiering and developing new skills.It is an interesting and an illuminating book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Complex, thought provoking, and wonderfully written. The first time I read these was about two years ago but this second time I was still totally sucked it. Can't wait to see Catching Fire in Nov!!
B00F35BV64|1.0|It's clearly horribly pixilated and after seeing this great technical effects film in HD or theater all you can see is mud and that your missing all the crisp detail here in the Standard Definition. However thanks to Amazon even if you order the HD one it won't play on any system that is not on the list. Really stupid as I can play HD on iTunes movies....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app really comes in handy when km picking our outdits for the next day. This app is very handy i hope more pwople decide to download it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love the game it is so addicting!!!!<br />Both my daughter and I play it together. It is fun to see what dragon you will hatch next.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|And it is, too!<br /><br />I am biased, I love the show, I enjoyed this season. Not as good as 5, but I am glad to have the Winchester boys any way I can get em!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An avid Grisham fan, I bought the Racketeer in digital version for my Kindle. From the beginning, it seemed \\"\\"off,\\" as though Grisham were working with a ghost writer.  Mystery solved (twice) at the end of this latest novel, when the author reveals he essentially did no research for this work. A bit disappointing for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What an interesting and intricate story. Loved it from the moment I started. I wanted more. Looking forward to reading more from Liane Moriaty.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|this movie was great in the theater and i knew i had to purchase it when it was released and i am happy that i did. im a huge fan of leo and i think he did a great job in the great gatsby.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Those that only want the facts and figures of WWII history can skip this one. If you want to know about the tears and fears behind the war, you need to read this. It's the story behind a picture that isn't unique in the types of aircraft it pictures, but is  unique in that the two exact aircraft it pictures (down to pilots and crew) met in exactly the pictured way during the war.
0062059963|5.0|its such a good book, omg, a little cheesy, but still good, a quick fun read c: Cant wait for the ladt one c:
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I love the history,  Also,  I have visited Colonial Williamsburg several times and was especially interested in seeing sections that were filmed there.  I actually bought this for a friend I was so impressed.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Brilliant and easy to use.<br />I know nothing about taking pictures and I have had great fun with this app and found it's a great help to get a chance to make a bad picture look good and I now have started sending pictures to my friends.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Stories and pic's are first rate, timely and to the point.  Easy to navigate.  Hard to shut down.  As exciting as when a 3rd grader opens a history book for the first read!  Keep up the great work.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I have never played games on any device before and I found this game addictive and great fun and the best thing that I have also found is that it's great for getting rid of any kind of stress.
B006PZBRCY|3.0|What can you say?  Hugh Jackman is always good and he makes for a good movie.  I am never a fan of movies wherein children have leading parts but the young boy in this movie was good.  The movie was good science fiction set in a near-distant future that kept the movie relevant and believable.  It smacks of all the marketing and corruption of professional sports though the premise of robot-fights is somewhat flimsy.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it was a fun, though fairly predictable romp that fit somewhere between rock-n-sock-em robots, old-school sci-fi, and an after school special on son and estranged-father reconciliation.

1781162646|3.0|&#34;Joyland&#34; is a pleasant,readable book.  It features very little suspense,gore,supernatural or mystery.  I find it hard to believe this is the same Stephen King who wrote &#34;The Stand,&#34;The Shining,&#34; Salem's Lot,&#34; or &#34;Desperation.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Joyland&#34; is a pleasant little tale of a college boy's coming-of-age in 1973.  In this book he is jilted by his girlfriend,his first true love,he loses his virginity to an older woman,he works for a carnival over the summer in North Carolina,which was the sight of a gruesome murder which still remains unsolved.<br /><br />Missing: Stephen King's very great ability to put colorful accents and speech into his characters.  For instance,the carnival locale is North Carolina, circa 1973.  One would hear heavy southern accents,and attitudes from carnival workers at that time and place.  Not a trace of an accent or local color here.  Ditto the landlady who runs the local boarding house.  Reading of her in this book she seems more English than a native of North Carolina.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the supernatural to happen,but alas,the few trifling events lead to nothing.  Ditto suspense.  A tad of suspense at the climax,but again,Stephen King Lite.<br /><br />I compare this to his masterly novella &#34;1922,&#34; a very dark tale of the Edgar Allen Poe genre,written only several years ago, and really wonder if this is indeed Stephen King writing the pleasant little novel &#34;Joyland....

B004SIP7F8|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoy this movie, though it's definitely his favorite of all time. The scenery and the way the story is put together is awesome. We watch this one repeatedly.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Classic coming of age story with some twists to make the story interesting. The boys and Mud were portrayed nicely, the rest did their jobs well but not as exceptional as these three main characters. McConaughey was magical to watch in his run-down, out of luck character. The river setting was a good choice, water always flowing, calm on the surface but cloudy and dangerous beneath. Small town Southern location is a refreshing place to watch the boys' adventure. This is a good movie that can be watched over and over through the years without getting old.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Yeah, I'm a grown-up (well, most of the time!) and I dearly love this movie. It's very well done and I think it's great.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Moss is an investigative journalist who explores what is going on, mostly with processed foods, in this book. It is not anti-business or an attack on an industry. It is instead an education about how the processed food industry functions and the challenges it has to become a more healthy choice in our daily lives.  It also uncovers the misdirection food companies use to make some things appear healthy by focusing on one ingredient while ignoring the rest and using labeling to their advantage. There are challenges with convenience foods and foods that can travel well and stay on store shelves for a long time.  A lot of science makes that possible, unfortunately science hasn't solved food alternatives to meet a healthy balance of salt, sugar and fat that serve a significant role in taste and consumer satisfaction. This is a good read that balances the industry's efforts with consumer desire and how all of that makes for a complex, difficult to change processed food industry.

B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I like Lee Child's books, but this movie was a disaster.  Charter developed is poor, plot is OK, acting is terrible, some action scenes were OK.  Nothing ever really 'came together'.  Every time I though it might start to get good, it just bombed.  I should have turned it off earlier.
B006LXQID8|5.0|This movie is extremely funny. At times whimsical, and at other times quite insightful. It manages to capture the pace and energy of living in Paris, but the entire film revolves around Amélie's efforts to maintain a level of warmth and human interaction that are missing from her life. The movie presents Paris from Amélie's singularly unique point of view, and it's impossible not to love.<br /><br />The story starts with a number of vignettes as we see young Amélie growing into adulthood, while the remainder of the story centers around a set of coincidences that convinces her to try and change the lives of those around her for the better. The pacing with which this movie jumps from scene to scene is often quite energetic (and in some ways similar to the films of Baz Luhrmann).<br /><br />Yann Tiersen's soundtrack is in my top 5 of the best ever composed, and probably #1 for how well that score fits the film. Its unique combination of accordion and piano is so good that it kicked off more than a decade of very bad imitators any time a movie or tv show was set in Paris (the most amusing rip-off of which I heard was in season 3 of Project Runway).<br /><br />Parents be warned: Quick but slightly graphic depiction of birth at the beginning, a few scenes depicting sex (mostly comical with mild female nudity), and one of the characters works in a Sex shop. The sex shop is more of an issue on High Def screens, since when I first watched this 10+ years ago I hadn't even realized that character was putting price tags on (boxed) sex toys.<br /><br />The subtitles, while adequate, do fail to capture some of what's being said, particularly by the narrator. Though this doesn't prevent you from following the movie, some of the poignancy and detail of the narrator's comments are lost.

B001F6ZIXC|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is very well-made, well-written, and extremely well-acted FICTION.  Though engaging and entertaining, it won't offer any insights into a real motorcycle club.  Kurt Sutter's speculations and story threads have woven a persuasive, enthralling TV show.  Let's keep all this in perspective:  excellent entertainment draws the viewer in, makes them feel as if they know these characters, and makes viewers envy and wish to be part of such a story.  But at the end of the day (and each episode), it's TV at its finest, and not a statement on real life.<br /><br />Some other reviewer mentioned ...\\"for people who don't know any 1%-ers,\\" but I would argue that those of us on the outside will never know anything about 1%-ers, because Motorcycle Clubs are secret societies, like the Masons. They fiercely guard those memberships; thus the need for prospects.  Even if you happen to be a family member of a patch-holder, you won't know anything more about the club than any average citizen. They do not and will not share club details with an outsider.  Any no 'old lady,' even one of a club president, could or would ever wield the kind of power and sway that Gemma does.  Women are regarded as p*ssy, and that is all.  Katey Sagal adds another dimension to the story threads through Gemma, but it's an entertaining and compelling farce.<br /><br />The actors in this entire series bring humility, reason, and understanding to a subculture of folks that just aren't that nice or interesting in real life.  Remember that they call themselves 'outlaws' for a reason.  They're an unknown quotient, so it's easy to speculate about them and give them the benefit of the doubt.  This makes for outstanding entertainment, done by fabulous  actors in realistic settings. Keep all of this in perspective:  you can envy them, buy a Harley, and ride on the weekends, but leave it at that.  They're the 1% that you wouldn't want to join, even if you could.  Go read the book, \\"Three Can Keep a Secret if Two Are Dead,\\" if you disagree.f Two Are Dead,\\" if you disagree.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|As a gamer, I needed a mouse that offered more than the basic left/right clicking capabilities. I moved on to a mouse with two side-buttons, but I really began to yearn for that extra third one.<br /><br />This mouse was exactly what I needed to fit that niche. It takes a little bit of time to get used to, but it is such a nice feature for binding specific abilities in games like Mass Effect 3, Battlefield, and Guild Wars 2. The DPI switch allows you to customize your sensitivity on the fly, allowing you to switch between 2-4 modes for precise aiming or quick camera turns.<br /><br />My only draw back, and why I gave this 4 and not 5, is that the side buttons aren't separate functions. They have to be bound to either a macro within the Anker mouse software, or a keyboard button. This can be overcome by assigning each to a key that you rarely use, but it would still be nice to bind in-game keys with MOUSE3, 4, and 5 instead. My mouse wheel has also started to squeak after about 5 months, but this isn't at all an issue worth complaining about.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gaming mouse within a small budget, I highly recommend this. You can't go wrong with it.<br /><br />EDIT: The squeaking has been gone for a while now.

B005P1YCNK|4.0|This is the 2nd time I've read this book, and like other personal development books I've read, when re-reading it, I get something new from it. Often times, if there had been enough time in between, it seems like it's a brand new book!<br /><br />I've gained considerable knowledge from \\"The Compound Effect\\". The only drawback I have with this book is that Darren Hardy was able to start life off on the right foot, with a father that was present in his life and fulfilled his role as a father the way we all would dream to have our parents do. Darren was taught, and learned, how to be successful from an early age. Many of us were not and have had to take much more time to reach success in areas of our lives. He definitely does not have a \\"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\\" sort of story, like many others in his field.<br /><br />That doesn't really take away from what Darren it teaching in this book however, unless you allow it to. By reading (and re-reading \\"The Compound Effect\\"), you will learn that it's the small, daily actions you do that will lead you to ultimate success. That you have to be consistent in what you do, regardless of the area of life you are working on. That there are ways to stand out from the others and to be extraordinary.<br /><br />There are worksheets he's provided that will help you determine your goals, find ways to eliminate distractions, and to keep you on task. Of course, just like anything else, they only work if you use them CONSISTENTLY!<br /><br />If Darren had a more compelling story as far as his start in life goes, I would have given this a 5. I'm a sucker for \\"rags to riches\\" stories, and am a walking example of that myself. And there are only 6 chapters in the book, which means each one is long. The way the book is set up though, it seems that is the how it needs to be. Otherwise, this is definitely a book that is a must read and one anyone and everyone should read several times on their road to success.
B003204MQS|1.0|This movie was obviously produced without a screenplay.  Horrible.  Not scary at all.  Nothing about it was scary.  After the first 15 minutes of being bored to death I ran the movie on fast forward the whole way through.  I guess if you thought Blair Witch Project was scary this is right up your alley.  Nowadays people can't make a good scary flick.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|Great rental if you have not scene it. Mystic River is one of those movies that is better the less you know about it. Especially if you are a family man, then this movie will speak to you and force you to think through difficult questions. Well written, great directions (by Clint Eastwood), and a quality cast make Mystic River an enjoyable watch.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is sooooooo addicting and fun it has no viruses and doesn't freeze u should defiantly get it its freeeeee!!!!
B006TZBGBW|3.0|First of all I'll start by saying the content is beyond great. Many of the albums are Masterpieces: Sad Wings of Destiny, Stained Class, British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, Defenders of the Faith, Painkiller... along with their oddities like Turbo and Ram It Down, right down to their three live albums and their more recent outputs, Angel of Retribution and Nostradamus. Judas Priest are pionners of metal in both sound and image and their reputation stands strong, having influenced directly or indirectly a lot of the bands that followed them. Their body of work is impressive, with some of metal's landmark albums and incredible album's worths of music, they certainly deserve a box set containing and celebrating their career. It's worth noting that even though the box says The Complete Albums Collection it is not in fact, complete. It's missing the Tim ''Ripper'' Owens era studio and live albums. It was aware before purchasing and it's not a huge deal as most will want this solely and majorly for the Halford recordings alone, but if it says complete it would be nice if it really was. I'm not trying to be difficult I just think it would have been neat to have ALL the Judas Priest albums in one place, and that includes the Tim Owens years, regardless of preference or opinion.<br /><br />On the positive, having all the albums in one place is fantastic. The box itself is nice but seems rather frail from being such soft cardboard. It nicely holds all 17 albums in a very compact space and it doesn't take much room. The booklet is nice and has liner notes at the beginning, and pictures and lists the songs and credit. Having the ''Killing Machine'' corrected on Hell Bent for Leather sleeve is a nice touch. My main grippe with this box set is the cardboard sleeves, mini vinyl replica sleeves that the CDs come in. I don't mind cardboard CDs cases, they may not be as strong as the more traditional jewel cases but they do the job and usually are for more special album treatments such as deluxe editions and they do feel nice. The problem here is that the discs are so tightly fit into their sleeves that it gets hard to pull them out and they tend to be more prone to scratches and damage.I'll give them that this was a great concept, having all the Halford years and there's a lot of good to this set (compact and the artwork on the discs etc) but the execution is just not what it maybe could or should have been.<br /><br />Based on money value alone, I think that all of the 17 Halford outputs in one box for less than a hundred dollars is great value. I picked this up because while I owned many Priest albums, I didn't have any of the live albums, and I was missing 5 albums so it made sense for me to buy this since it had all those albums and looked like a cool box set and I would have paid just as much if not more to complete my individual Judas Priest CD collection. I really wish the box was made of more solid material as it feels like it could break in two very easily, plus the sleeves are just too tight for the CDs and again, having the Owen recordings would have made this a truly complete set. At face value, 17 albums for this price is absolutely great but the package takes it down a little. I would say it's more of a budget release than a real collector's item. 3.5 stars.s such as deluxe editions and they do feel nice.

1594202273|1.0|The only words I can use to describe this book is disappointing. I only wish I would have taken the time to read other reviewers comments before purchasing this book.  Perhaps the author was still suffering from \\"Reefer Madness\\", his previous work.  A competent editor could have restructured and edited this book to half it's original content.<br />and still produced a decent text on the subject.  Unfortunately this book has all the qualities of a schizophrenic bipolar girl friend on a meth fueled jag. One can only wonder if the author was getting paid by the word or the editor was suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder. Other reviewers comments \\"Frayed & Verbose\\", \\"Half Tech Manual Half Almanac\\" and \\"Hugely Flawed\\" accurately describe the books short coming's. Perhaps a title of \\"Erectile Dysfunction\\" would have been a more appropriate for this Thermonuclear bomb of a book.

But I also love 'Oceano', 'Mi Mancherai', 'When You Say You Love Me', 'My Confession', and 'Per Te'. Buy it and fall in love, buy it and treasure the wonderful music always.

This is a wonderful compilation of songs, from the beautiful, soaring melodies from songs like 'Un Giorno Per Noi' (which is my personal favorite), and 'Mai', to the lovely English songs, in which Josh's voice shines: 'You Are Loved', 'So She Dances', 'In Her Eyes', and 'Febuary Song', to name a few. An absolute MUST for the collection of any Grobanite, or any music fan. My only complaint is that the title track 'Awake' was not included. I love every song on this album, all for different reasons. Bravo Josh Groban on a job well done.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have a couple of Roku Hi-Def streamers and a Vizio Co-Star Stream Player. I wanted to try this inexpensive method to get my computer and Ipad on my big screen TV wirelessly. I ordered and received it within a week. It came packaged very nicely with everything you need. A neat feature is you can connect the USB directly to your TV ( if it has an input. If not, it also comes with a power source that plugs into the wall or strip.) to power the gadget. The set-up is straightforward and easy to download Google Chrome from, in my case, a laptop. It synced my laptop to the TV and in short order and I was up in running. I first tried Netflix which was immediately flagged until I installed Silverlight. Okay, that done, I was flagged because the content I was trying to play ( Breaking Bad episode) was not supported. Huh? I tried an Amazon Prime episode of Alpha House and it was cast in whatever less than 480p is, just horrible. It consistently froze and disconnected. The final straw? The app store DOES NOT offer any way to stream your own videos. You are left with an inferior streaming device. As a way to get the internet from your laptop or other device to the TV it does a so-so job, mainly due to the glitches. Roku and the Co-star do a much better job of streaming movies, Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime content . Although they cost more, I feel there are better, more versatile alternatives out there.

1401207529|5.0|As usual with great graphic novels, I'm late to the party again.<br /><br />BATMAN: YEAR ONE is as the title states, the beginning of Batman's origins.<br /><br />But, and this is a big but, this is also a deep look into the life of Gotham City's new police chief, Gordon, his wife and new baby, the corrupt city he's now charged with policing and the complicated relationship he has with his lieutenant officer.<br /><br />This is not the kiddie Batman of my youth.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Frank Miller writes in very complex but intriguing terms.  The story is understandable by human terms and not supernatural in comic book terms.  Batman is equal in terms of his complexity as Gordon and Gotham City is.  Bruce is conflicted and tormented by the events of his youth and you see clearly how he fights off his demons.<br /><br />You also follow how the events of the city and its corrupt officials try desperately to hold on to the mechanisms that keep them in power but puts them at odds with Gordon and subsequently Batman.<br /><br />The illustrations are one that I'm most relieved with.  Having recently read, \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" and being GREATLY disappointed with the illustrative work of Klaus Janson, YEAR ONE has an illustrator who gets it: David Mazzucchelli gets it. (If it weren't for the masterful storytelling of Miller, DARK KNIGHT would have been an epic fail.<br /><br />This was a perfect collaboration to say the least.<br /><br />BATMAN: YEAR ONE is a stellar piece of work and most definitely a work of art.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is so much fun! The only thing I don't like is that you have to use real money! Other than that it is AWESOME!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I, along with hundreds of other fans of the novel, think that Defending Jacob is a fascinating read.  Landay hurls forensically correct information, family drama, and murder--possibly two--at the reader, never allowing the narrator to judge anything he states; Landay uses first person objective point of view to lure in the reader to make his own decisions concerning the who, what, and how of the plot.  This is a &#34;WANT TO&#34; read novel.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I just love this app! It has emoticons, you can communicate with people, its just really cool! I love it!
B005LAIIMG|1.0|Watched the dvd today and want my money back!<br />Nothing like the book whatsoever,and a cliched,plotless,snorefest.<br /><br />Save your time and money and avoid this like the plague(no pun intended)
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so much fun! I downloaded it a while back but never got the chance to play it but now that I've started it up again I can't put my kindle down! I would recommend it!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|It came fastest then I was expecting work fine I wound highly recommend them. I would for sure use them again
B007PFD90G|2.0|Good grief - way too long - too much name dropping mostly names I have never heard of. This book should have been no more than 300 pages.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This is a great movie my nephews love this movie and we purchased the dvd and they watch it all the time.  I now have it on my kindle for when we have road trips.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|How can you do better than Emily Bronte?  This is a classic love story that is timeless.  Every woman (and man) should read this book.  It takes you away to another time and another place. I have read it so many times that I could almost recite it from memory.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Though a bit darker then the old original ones, this series I hope continues as I like the humor and the plots.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Starts off interesting enough but quickly devolves into a drawn out, boring slog. The dialog is inane and full of movie cliches you've heard a dozen times before. Ruffalo is so uncharismatic as to be distracting. He looks like a homeless guy and I felt as if I could smell him through the screen. Isla fisher is nice to look at but utterly unconvincing. Michael Caine and Morgan freeman turn in bland performances as the plot turns from a caper flick to a silly, mystical mess.  Eisenberg is fun to watch and may be the only bright spot.<br /><br />This movie could have been fun and was a surprise hit. A surprise because insiders probably knew how bad it was. A sequel  is on the way. Let's hope they don't use the same writing team.
B007PJ8RNQ|5.0|Rickie is always interesting. She never sounded better. Personally I prefer the sound of this disc to vinyl. All of richie's recordings are interesting and compelling. this is one of my favorites.
B0057567P0|1.0|The card comes with a Mac OS 10.8 driver (so sonnettech claims). I am using it with my Intel i& 17 inch MBP. When I first installed the driver and restarted the card recognized my Seagate 4.0 TB external USB 3.0 drive. However , the drive soon disappeared from the desktop but kept spinning. Unplugging the drive, reinstalling the software and restarting the computer allows the card to temporarily recognize it, but  I need to reinstall the software which requires restart to use it. As a result, my Seagate USB 3.0 drive is used by my USB 2.0 ports. Don't waste your money.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|A great movie that requires one to think, not for those who want to just sit back. While visually stunning in its beauty, the dialogue is subtle and deep. This movie speaks to the human character, what do you choose to believe, how will that determine the future.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was a great romance, but it was so much deeper than most. It really tackled a serious issue but through great characters and an interesting plot! Also it was very well written, unlike most romance novels.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie on my 120 inch screen at home.  Most zombie movies seem to be about how much carnage directors can get on screen to shock us.  This was more of a thriller, adventure zombie movie.  Most of the zombie-munching-on-live-brains shots were fron a distance.  In short, not much gore.  The pkot was fine, acting was above average, and the suspence was pretty good.  There was no nudity or simulated sex, and profanity was kept to a bare minimum.  Overall, great movie.  I look forward to more from this production team.
B001BANK32|5.0|This Novel by Stephen King I  I e of the best novels. The movie is nothing compared to the great story telling in this novel.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I love it! My small knives are very sharp now. it fits int a bug out bag, or a pocket.

B0042X9L6A|4.0|I love this flash, still so much to learn and experiment with and looking forward to the learning curve. Great addition to any Nikon camera bag.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|I bought it as a birthday gift for my daughter. She loved all them and it was a great way to have all of them in one case. The beds are clear and sound is awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy playing it to kill some spare time when I have nothing else to do for a lil while
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I love the Daily Mail and its the only news source I really use (and I live in the US). This app is much better laid out than the&quot;online&quot; version, but it force closes often immediately out when I'm trying to view photos. Also, the last week or so, I haven't been able to open it at all. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I'll be downloading the online version for my kindle now but I'm not happy about it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is my favorite game I play it all the time. It also has a great story line and the graphics are awesome!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|I truely love it. don't think it's over priced.it's the most awsome game.it's nothing like you have ever played.you should get it
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and was thrilled when the movie came out.  It was a spectacular film and was a find reflection of the book.  I was so excited to see it and really enjoyed it.
1623360277|5.0|This book is a compilation of all of Dr. John McDougall's work since the 1970s.  Having attended two of his programs, and being a firm believer in his message, I highly recommend this book.  The information is based on science and is essential to good health. Mary McDougall's recipes are simple to prepare and delicious.  I personally have reversed Type 2 Diabetes while enjoying wonderful food, including starches like brown rice, whole wheat pasta, potatoes (yes, even the much aligned white potato), vegetables, fruits and legumes.  It dismays me that this message is not wholeheartedly endorsed by the media and the medical and pharmaceutical establishments.  (Of course, there is no money in broccoli.)  Oh, and by the way, you will lose weight and have no trouble keeping it off.  I eat more than I ever did before, while weighing less.  I not miss meat and dairy at all, and in fact find them quite repulsive!  Please help your health and the planet by following a whole food, plant based diet, or starch-based diet, the term Dr. McDougall prefers. This  book contains all the information you need to do so.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Loved the characters.  The movie was very violent but it also had a great story.  Loved it.  Recommended it to family and friends.  They liked it as well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The whole idea of time travel to right the wrongs of the world has always been fascinating to me, this book fits the bill!
0545586178|5.0|Collins manages to do something that many authors of trilogies can't do -- produce a second installment that's significantly better than the first. Catching Fire picks up right where the first book ends -- Katniss has outsmarted the Capitol by surviving the arena and winning the Hunger Games... with Peeta. And here is where the games really begin. Katniss is now seen as a rebel -- a symbol of hope for all districts desperate to escape the gritty slums the Capitol has forced them to. She is now a problem that the Capitol is bent on eliminating. As a result, she and several other past Hunger Games victors are sent back into the arena for what can only be described as an All-Star Hunger Games. The best of the best battling it out in an arena even more sick and twisted than the forest-like arena Katniss faced in the first book. I'll end the review here -- so as not to give too much away. But I'll say that Catching Fire will suck you in from beginning to end. It is, in essence, a suspenseful, witty, edge of your seat love story. Themes of rebellion, power, and courage are explored in what is quite possibly one of the best books I've read in recent years. Highly recommended.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Package came as ordered. Show is a good SF epic. Too bad they canceled the show. Does a good job of explaining some of the background
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I thought it was fun.  The graphics are really great. Game play is very smooth. Best of all it was free. This is one of the better pinball games out there. You need more like this for free.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was worried when I heard about the changes. The story really is not like the original, but might be what Tolkin would have written if he had planned to include this story in the with the others. well worth watching.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|We are happy and we own every season of Supernatural and we are looking forward to purchasing Season 7 of Supernatural
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is really a look at what a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMO) would look like with virtual reality.  Kind of living a Dungeons and Dragons adventure in a quasi \\"Matrix\\".<br /><br />After reading the negative reviews (before reading the book) I was waiting to get annoyed with all the 1980s references.  While the references are definitely there, it didn't annoy me in the slightest.  I think it was well executed and not much of a distraction from the rest of the story.<br /><br />The story is exciting and flows extremely well.  While I don't think this book will go down as a literary masterpiece to put on the shelf next to The Count of Montecristo and A Tale of Two Cities, it is a fun and exciting read.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Amazing the entire family loved it an  this movie was so great we have now purchased it, we cant wait to get it in the mail so we can watch it again
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Though the author's celebration of companies like Phillip Morris and Fannie Mae now seems (with the passage of time) a bit off-key, the book is a remarkable, scholarly study of companies that consistent beat the competition (and the market generally) and the habits they share.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|If your looking to write well this book is a blessed asset. Not only that he shares his personal struggles and triumphs.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|This is a cool special effects movie.  The plot is not great but it is worth seeing in 3D. I would not recommend unless your going to watch in 3D.
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|I downloaded this app multiple times over the last few weeks. I have yet to play it, because it always says there is an error in my download! Very frustrating, might as well just throw money away!!
B000T2EXXO|4.0|If you know who Kenny Burrell is then I probably don't have to tell you that Kenny is one of the finest guitar players in jazz. The songs, arrangements and musicianship are all top notch here.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Once again, Guy Clark delivers a great total music experience.  Wonderful lyrics/writing.  A master at his craft.  Totally enjoyable CD
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was very well writen. It makes you think how the simplest action can affcxt someone 500 miles away. It also makes you think about what you would do if this ever happened to you.
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|Although most of the time I get stumped when on the upper levels. It will periodically freeze, however, causing me to reset my phone.<br /><br />The game hangs every time I get to level 27, just going through game over, restart, without allowing any play
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Does what they said it would do.  Still hoping for more providers to sign on.  For the price you can't go wrong.
B00AHHODH2|1.0|Poorly written and edited.  Read more like a screenplay for a dreary comedy than a thriller. Not worthy of Gordonston!
B006G35QGI|4.0|Funny, appropriate for the whole family.  Sad to See Lindsey Lohan's life go south after this.  Our 7 and 9 year-olds loved it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can't quite put my finger on it but is strangely addictive. It's very repetitive but full of interesting adventure and you some how keep finding out new ways to do things though you run it 100 times. I mean if anything it's frackin free shat so give it a whirl.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I purchased this E Book because I was interested in getting into Aquaponic's, I found the book to be very informative and detailed<br />I'm still reading it at this point, but I know I will use it as a bible to Aquaponic's and refer again and again to it.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how we keep using the altruistic good guy versus bad guy, or girl, theme and still have some form of originality. it was reasonably good for an old platform.
0802473156|5.0|Wish I would have read this years ago.  Have given it out to other family members.  Use it and live a good life.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|I was bored one night, found this available. I watched it and laughed all the way through it. Incredibly funny with a strong moral point about integrity of self.
B00AO7HNFY|5.0|I too have been playing this new Eric Burdon release over & over again. Great effort by one of the elders of British blues interpreters. What I am wondering is how is the audio quality on the vinyl version? I have posted & reposted my comments on facebook regarding this great record. 96 reviewers can't be all wrong ? Not a bad track on the whole record. Kudos to Mr Burdon for releasing this excellent recording. Add to the mix some kickass players. Listening to the CD version thru Audioengine5 + Premium Powered Speakers. If your musical tastes run to Blues & R&B music played on real instruments with a singer with a life time of dues paying with some great soulful, heartfelt vocals buy this record. You can't go wrong. A life long music fan.[[ASIN:B00AGKH7K0 Til Your River Runs Dry]]
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Brad Pitt continues making quality films although this is probably a blockbuster in his recent film roster.<br />This new film is supposedly went through a lengthy and troubled production(refer to Vanity Fair's article)<br />but the resulting film is very satisfying as an edge-of-seat entertainment.<br />It was probably due to the backings of Pitt's production company \\"Plan B\\" under Pitt's direction to \\"fine tune\\" the film.<br />Zombie movies are overdone but this one is different.<br />It comes with a coherent and possible scenario of the cause of virus outbreak that turn humans to zombies spreading<br />so fast that the world couldn't cope.<br />It is basically a run and chase film with several intensely written and directed action sequences that linked the film together.<br />Although the concept of Brad Pitt alone who saved the world is a bit over the top but the resulting film is<br />saved by a satisfyingly intense action thriller from start to finish with Pitt leading a fine supporting cast.

B00DWZHTOU|3.0|The premise of this film is basically a Magnificent Seven in the world of magic.<br />Someone has a score to settle so he/she recruited a band of second tier magicians around the world<br />to assist.<br />The film is fast-paced with characters speak fast, camera work moves fast and story line runs fast<br />and leave no time for the audience to think and question the logics of the story.<br />The credit must be given to the filmmakers and the engaging cast for this entertaining caper that comes<br />with a \\"it doesn't make any sense\\" script and mundane and disappointing ending.<br />When the film ends, you feel kind of being cheated.
B008LV8TSU|3.0|I would recommend Mercedes Lackey Fairy tales (Tales of the five hundred kingdoms, Beauty and the Werewolve. The Fairy God Mother, The Sleeping Beauty...) or if you have never read it The Princess Bride by S. Morganstern as being better written in the same genre.  The Princes Bride is a must read novel, then rent the movie for further enjoyment.<br /><br />But if you love this type of novel this one is a good read.  The author does make the triumphant battle with evil unnecessarily complicated with trying to figure out which body part belongs to whom; but it is a fun novel that could be loaned to young juveniles with no concerns.  In keeping with the fairy tale theme true love and good triumphs over evil and evil has no redeeming qualities.  It is fun, although not to be taken too seriously.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|To start with, I am not a Star Trek fan although I found the previous one was well-made and entertaining.<br />This one started on a wrong foot with Kirk chased by a band of natives covered in white paint in a land of<br />blood red trees and vegetation while a volcano is erupting!<br />Could someone in Hollywood come up with a more inventive set piece to kick off the film?<br />The rest of the movie is a patch work of borrowings from this film and that film with some intense action sequences to wake<br />up the viewers' senses.<br />The saving grace of this instalment is Benedict Cumberbatch who lends some credibility and class to this mash while<br />Chris Pine's Kirk has become an embarrassment to this franchise.<br />A disappointing instalment.
1881273377|5.0|This cd has shed some light on romantic relationship understanding. I enjoyed it the details of the author ability to understand his clients.
B008JFUO36|4.0|I am not a Tron fan and came to this film without much expectations.<br />I was pleasantly surprised.<br />This is one of the best film in Tom Cruise's recent film roster with a good story, great production design<br />and great action sequences.<br />Critics tend to put down Tom Cruise's films but Guys, this is the hardest working actor in Hollywood who<br />continues making good quality entertainment for the mass audience!<br />Watch it, you would not be disappointed!

B005EJNAO0|3.0|Bruce Willis is good but the plot got a bit iffy towards the end. Overall, I enjoyed watching this film but cannot imagine seeing it again or recomending it wholeheartedly to anyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started out slow for me but really became intriguing half way through. I was not expecting that ending though! Great read overall!
B004JHY8A8|4.0|I liked this book but what the Nazi's did was horrid and it is a wonder that any person survived.  The book switches from modern to war times and I found the modern characters a bit unreal and I could see where the story was going and where it was to end.  A good read though.
0792846443|4.0|Misery, based on a Stephen King novel of the same name, is the second film adaptation of Stephen King's work to be directed by Rob Reiner, who also directed the classic 1986 Comedy-Drama Stand by Me, based on King's personal favorite work, The Body. This is a tense, thrilling, and finely crafted film that even has hints of dark comedy thrown in from time to time, mostly revolving around the sometimes awkward and sometimes disturbing conversations between Paul Sheldon (James Caan), and Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Seeing Bates playing a complete psycho was certainly interesting and a bit fun, if I may be so bold. While at times her odd speech and behavior had me laughing, even in some of the so-called dramatic moments, at other times they had me filled with terror and unease as I realized along with Paul just what sort of grave situation he had found himself in. He's crippled from an accident in the house of his self proclaimed \\"number one fan\\", who's one of those obsessed stalker types that tend to pop up from time to time in our celebrity obsessed society. In fact, she reminded me a bit of Sandra Bernhard's character Masha from the disturbingly hilarious black comedy The King of Comedy. She has a definite air of unpredictability about her, and you never know how she'll respond to a certain situation, making her perhaps one of the most frightening villains in cinematic history, right up there with Hannibal Lecter, Patrick Bateman, and Johan Liebert from the manga/anime series Monster. Kathy Bates put on a real good performance here, I will say that, perhaps one of the best of her career, and certainly superior to her role as Dolores Claiborne in the other Stephen King adaptation she starred in. James Caan also did great in his role as Paul Sheldon, a hapless writer trapped in a nightmarish situation that is all too real for many famous people, who often fear meeting obsessive fans like Annie. Of course Annie isn't all bad, there are moments of true kindness and sweetness that when looked back upon during some of her more psycho moments, seem almost unreal. It certainly doesn't seem unrealistic though, as many psychopaths and serial killers appear kind and friendly, even charming, to most people, but have a hidden dark side that most people would never suspect. Just look at murderers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy. Great Film but no masterpiece due to the fact that there was a bit too much unintentional humor in some scenes. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.ness that when looked back upon during some of her more psycho moments, seem almost unreal.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My husband thinks I'm nuts for crying over a book. He just doesn't understand.... First I would like to say that this book is far better than I thought it would be. It's so heart wrenching. Everything about this book is amazing. August Waters and Hazel Grace will forever be in my heart. Never have I read a book that makes me reflect on my own life and the people I love. Never have I read a book that makes me appreciate life. Thank you John Green.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great British series...couldn't stop watching after 1st episode!!  Must watch television!!  A real whodunit that will keep you guessing episode after episode.
B006FPFTMS|1.0|7 inches sceen is too small to readers sometimes and need to change position. But, Foxit Mobile PDF still keep the original position not flexible.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|A friend turned me onto Dream Theater a number of years ago.  He knew I was a big Rush fan and figured I would appreciate the talent.  I was impressed by the studio work, but was convinced there was no way the band could reproduce their studio work live.  I was proven very wrong.  As impossible as I may have thought - Dream Theater is even more impressive in concert.  Seriously.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Tolkien for the 21st century. Vision, pacing, plot, scope, character development, and authors' craft are all superb. If you enjoy binge-watching seasons of TV shows this is the way to read the series!

B00F91RYL8|1.0|Other than stealing the title from the book, this movie had absolutely nothing in common with the book. Except that there are zombies... The book is written post  zombie apocalypse... the movie made me wish I was living through one so I'd have an excuse to tear my own eyes out....  fail. fail fail fail...
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it if you like a gripping read.  I have recommended  it to several friends.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great color, perfect fit. Not too bulky. Great quality. Hate how these reviews require so many words, cuz sometimes there's just nothing left to say.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|this was a great season. I was glued to the TV waiting for the next episode. All the characters are changing and making<br />the show more and more interesting. Keep watching it seems to just keep getting better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Needs better instructions. Took me quite awhile to figure out what I needed to do in the first room. I was also able to get through all 10 floors in one day, so they definitely need to hurry and add more floors.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|great cast, great storyline, well told.<br /><br />compelling characters.  particularly touching if you are in, have been in, or know people in the arts.<br /><br />if you like this, you may also want to check out  SING FASTER - THE STAGEHANDS' RING CYCLE.  the San Francisco Opera's production of  Wagner's RING from a backstage perspective.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great shows enjoyed every min. of it. Hope more coming in the future. Recommend Downton Abbey to anyone that enjoys a good family type play.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I watched one show and was instantly hooked! I actually all of the seasons over the course of 5 days since I couldn't get enough. The main plot is obvious from British history but there are more than enough subplots to keep one interested. One doesn't have to be an expert in British history to keep up, but it is very entertaining with a lot of plot twists, turns, etc. Very graphic with some sexual scenes in it however. I would never allow little ones to watch it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved it. As soon as I saw it I new I would love it. And because I played this game befor.
B00881VLCE|4.0|nice puzzles. they keep you occupied and the pictures are nice too. if you like puzzles this is a good app to buy.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Inspired by Twin Peaks, Pines combines elements of Twilight Zone, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Lost, and X-Files in an engaging thriller that is nearly impossible to put down. Unlike Lost, Crouch provides a satisfying conclusion that both makes sense and sets up the next book in the series, which should continue for a long, long time. Definitely fodder for a big hit on TV.
B005COO1X6|5.0|A short story but full of that Stephen King punch. A simple little story that starts off innocently enough, but then, this is Stephen King. It builds and builds, you don't know where it's going but you willingly follow along. Little book, big punch.
B00CXQL828|4.0|Superb playing. I had to get past first 3 tracks before I really got into it.  I love all the tracks after that.  I found the first 3 too busy.  More soul in the rest.

B000FCKPHG|2.0|If you think you can achieve something, you most likely can; if you think you can't achieve something, you most likely can't.<br /><br />I was told I had to read this book prior to starting a class that I feel is important for my career. I started to read it and I thought, \\"What is the woman babbling about?\\" As others have said, she could have summed up the book in an article and gone on her merry way. Instead, she somehow believed that she could pen a tome that would be all encompassing and that could be applied to every situation that human beings might encounter: school, jobs, dating, marriage, ad nauseam.<br /><br />She basically posits that we have a \\"fixed-mind set\\" or a \\"growth-mind set.\\" Okay, that's great. And that we can change our fixed-mind set to that of a growth-mind set. Okay, great.<br /><br />So, that's good to know and I believe she's right that we can change our mindsets if we are even aware of what they are. That is why I did not give this book one star, because at least she attempts to point out certain ways of thinking that identify one as having one mindset over the other.<br /><br />The problem is, I think, she relates all this information in an incredibly chatty, friendly, gossipy, finger-pointing way. I did not feel that I was reading a well-researched, well-written book. It had that feeling of a 1970s self-help book, told in a kind of conversational, simplistic way. Along the way she shares numerous  stories about other people, including famous ones, and their mindsets. Of interest, yes, but she goes on and on. She also seems to have it in for certain CEOs and sport stars and I felt she was very judgmental about them.<br /><br />People struggle with mindsets, yes. The fact that she is attempting to make people aware of the mindset they have and that it can be changed is good; the way she goes about it is not.<br /><br />As others have said, the book essentially repeats itself over and over.<br /><br />I think the whole thing could (and should) be reduced to a nice tight article for Reader's Digest.uld) be reduced to a nice tight article for Reader's Digest.

6304708483|5.0|This movie shows some great, and sometimes funny, Beatle performances from their early days in the sixties.  John snorting &#34;Coke&#34; on the train is one joke that few people got at the time and that slipped by the censors.  John compliments George &#34;nice job that, George&#34; (or something thereof) on his rendition of &#34;I'm Happy Just To Dance With You&#34; -- as I understand it; this is a song that John and Paul thought was rather formulaic and were loathe to sing, thus giving it to George who actually nails it.  The jazz dance piano rendition (whether you like it or not) just before the boys take the stage is rather unique and will only be heard in this movie, and is probably an inside reference to it being a &#34;formula&#34; song.  However, that being said, I genuinely enoy the intro chord structure and lifting melody of  &#34;I'm Happy Just To Dance With You&#34;.  And of course, the instumental version of &#34;This Boy&#34; with Ringo in a funk while walking the town is a classic (according to Ringo, he really was feeling out-of-sorts that day).<br /><br />All of the Beatle first top hits are in this movie, and considering it was a monoural world back then, this edition has been rendered to look and sound just fine coming across your TV set.  You can't go wrong in owning this piece of history in the making.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|We did not have Showtime when this came out but it doesn't matter.  Being able to watch all 4 seasons without waiting for a week in between was great.<br /><br />The series is compelling way to learn the gastly history of Henry the 8th.
B009LDD54K|5.0|By far, the 3rd season of this series is the best.  The actors and storyline are outstanding.<br />Graft and political corruption to this day are still going strong....it is just a way of life in our society..<br />From cinematography to the clothing the characters wear, this is believable and very entertaining.
B008602KQI|5.0|Gruesome to think what these kids were put through, and there is no way that it nk they will ever be able to forget or get over what they went through.<br />If you liked this film, try the Japanese Version, not as good, but it's a Classic! Battle Royale- is the title.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I bought this to prepare my grandson for seeing a live presentation of the show at the Fireside theatre in Wisconsin.  I thought the plant that eats half the cast might be a little scary.  He was only 4.  The DVD movie was great and of the best quality imaginable.  The live show was fabulous.  His aunt played Crystal. At the  end of the first show he was singing the song \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" and begging to see the play and movie again.  We saw the show twice and he has seen the video over and over again.  This was a great purchase.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Leonardo Dicaprio is always amazing and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. I was tentative about watching it, because I'm not a huge fan of Tobey Maguire, but I liked it.

1781162646|5.0|If you're expecting a typical King horror story then skip this one.  Yes, there's a long ago murder that's key to the plot and the book finally builds up to an exciting climax but this is mostly a coming-of-age story about a 21 year old college student who spends his summer working at a carnival in North Carolina in 1973.  It's about the friendships he makes, the responsibilities he learns and the experiences that will leave an impact on him for the rest of his life. It's not an edge-of-your seat thriller at all but it's a well-written story that brings back a simpler time when carnivals hadn't given way yet to major theme parks and when life as a whole seemed a bit simpler.  Rather than compare it to King novels like Carrie, The Shining or The Stand, think more of The Green Mile.  If you're looking for an exciting read then there are better choices out there for you.  If you want a well-written, enjoyable read that will take you back in time then I'd recommend this one.

Hardy's performance is what I loved, and the way he transformed to become his character. The chemistry between the actors was transparent. They all made an amazing movie.
0393339882|5.0|If you like learning about physics and the history of physics discoveries you will love this book. Manjit goes into account after account relating the discoveries and interactions among the likes of Einstein, Bohr, Born, Pauli, Heisenberg (the real one not the Breaking Bad guy) Planck, Bohm, in short just about anyone who had something to say about physics in the 20th century. At the center of the book's theme is the tension between Bohr and his team's Copenhagen Interpretation where the Quantum is all and Einstein's lingering feelings that there is something more at work that would allow complete understanding of the mechanics of the micro-atomic world. It will leave your head spinning in a good way - but I'm not really sure if the spin is up or down. If only I could measure it with accuracy :-) Thanks for a great book Manjit.

B00D2PIUAM|5.0|Speaking as a fan who never entirely give up on Placebo, Loud Like Love is a true 5-star album.  I was quite surprised to hear an album from them that's so perfectly executed and emotionally rich.  It effortlessly references the band's past, while encapsulating what their best at right now.  I cannot recommend enough to listen on headphones or a nice stereo because the album is recorded beautifully, and computer speakers won't come close to doing it justice.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game cant get enough of it. Very additives. Great game to play. Great images. And its very fun to play.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Howl's Moving Castle takes us through the lives of a young, working-class girl and a wizard, who are (literally) from different worlds. Such a story clearly has a lot of possibilities for greatness. Most of the book lives up to those possibilities.  The book was a longer read than I was expecting, but the ending comes with unwelcome haste. We wait through the whole book for the face-off at the end, but the author rushed through it. Other than the book crashing to a conclusion, I felt this book was very interesting and worth reading.
0307352153|3.0|Latter portion of book lost some focus and political viewpoint of author showed through.  I would have preferred to not be able to discern politics of the author.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|Wonderful to see TV shows that include great writing and character development. These characters are intelligent, driven, and sometimes flawed; but believable and human.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I love how the characters' stories keep unfolding, and how they changed the pace of the plotting putting a major event/cliffhanger into the middle of the season, as well as at the end.  Still going strong!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so realistic an  the kids like it with the real actual horse to care for so they can get a responsibility on actually taking care of a real horse.

1451695195|2.0|Having a medical degree in my background, I always like to read what people believe is true.  I am a devout Christian and do believe that there is an afterlife but this novel really doesn't do it for me.
B009RX85N0|4.0|Great acting from all the leads,Robert Carlyle in particular.  The sets and special effects are really good, and some the characters costumes, such as the Evil Queens are fantastic.<br />The writing within the series is very clever, with plots and subplots weaving in and out of the storyline and flashbacks showing hidden and unexpected depths to the fairy tale characters.<br />This series starts with the curse of Storybrooke broken.  We get to know more about some of Storybrookes residents pasts and discover Henrys father.<br />Lots of Action and intrigue, series two finishing on the brink of another adventure.<br />If I had one criticism to make, I would say the series is slightly cheesey at times, but then it is based on fairy tales.<br />Cant wait for series 3.
1781162646|4.0|Student Devin Jones spends a summer working at an amusement park Joyland, located in North Carolina. In 1973, Disneyland has not yet gobble up all the other parks in America and become a monopolist, and organizers expect a steady flow of visitors. In addition to the old-timers are hired temporarily students - to do a dirty work. Devin will have to dance in the heat in a fur dog suit, scrape the vomit with seat rides, pick up trash, control a cart train, and he is ready for it all. Working in the park all day long helps the protagonist to forget his first love, who broke his heart. Description of the park everyday life is mixed with supernatural element: in the horror pavilion once a girl had been murdered. The killer was never found, although the police had even photos of the suspect taken by park workers. And some old-timers say that the ghost of the murdered girl sometimes shows up to children and adults in the horror pavilion.<br /><br />Stephen King has written a short novel for the publishing house specializing in pulp classics. This novel is short only by King's standards, it's only 280 pages, but by the standards of paperbacks of 50s and 60s it's 100 pages too long. Good two-thirds of the novel is devoted to the everyday life of the park, just in the spirit of King:<br /><br />«I ride-jockeyed. I flashed the shys in the mornings-meaning I restocked them with prizes-and ran some of them in the afternoons. I untangled Devil Wagons by the dozen, learned how to fry dough without burning my fingers off, and worked on my pitch for the Carolina Spin. I danced and sang with the other greenies on the Wiggle-Waggle Village's Story Stage. Several times Fred Dean sent me to scratch the midway, a true sign of trust because it meant picking up the noon or five PM take from the various concessions. I made runs to Heaven's Bay or Wilmington when some piece of machinery broke down and stayed late on Wednesday nights-usually along with Tom, George Preston, and Ronnie Houston-to lube the Whirly Cups and a vicious, neck-snapping ride called the Zipper. Both of those babies drank oil the way camels drink water when they get to the next oasis. And, of course, I wore the fur.»<br /><br />With nostalgia in his voice, an elderly narrator recalls this summer in \\"Joyland\\", and then a fall, for Devin decided to postpone his admission to college. The abundance of details does not seem excessive, you can feel the era with your skin. In «Author's Note» King writes that «much of what I call\\" the Talk \\"doesn't exist» - carnival slang used in the novel was half-invented. But all these greenies, gazoonies, rubes, points, etc are not only organically woven into the text (you never uknow what was invented and what was not), but also will make you laugh. And if King removed the mystery element Joyland would become a normal production coming-of-age novel.<br /><br />But King did not remove the mystery, though took it to the side, making the novel crooked to one side. Pulp writer would never allow himself to write this book: the thrills here are one on hundred pages, not enough. Only in the last 50 pages King seems to recall, and mystery element breaks through the surface. Though whodunnit here is so-so and puzzle is rough. King, alas, failed with a serial killer plot.<br />I was confused also with the author's use of the grammar. Italian «Capisce» suddenly becomes «kapish», and the characters with accents on paper suddenly lose all apostrophes:<br /><br />«When a guy does that, I notify em that they're foulin the line. The points? Never.» If consider the scene where mentioned the driver who ran down the child to death because he was on the phone while driving (in 1970, it is unlikely that the driver worked at law enforcement agencies), the editor deserves a reprimand.<br /><br />King has not lost the talent, but there is little joy for the reader in this Joyland.
B00459EZLW|5.0|I have not really watched the other Star Gate much shows but I really liked this one. Perhaps because it is a bit darker than the others. I liked DS9 over the other Star Trek shows for the same reason. It is more of an exploration of peoples souls than of space.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Great movie can't wait for the second anchor man to come out. If you like will Farrell you will love this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a page turner...I finished it in one afternoon.<br /><br />Lots of characters to keep track of, and keep their intertwined relationships straight, but the storylines are interesting and make you think \\"huh, how would I react if I were in that situation?\\" I enjoyed it.<br /><br />As a personal beef, I didn't care for the name John-Paul.  Just felt too fancy or formal for the story. Maybe because that feels like a French name to me, and his character was apparently Australian?<br /><br />But, overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good game<br />Good for  kids of all ages and even parents very entertaining and time fillin<br />Not hard to understand or too difficult to follow
0399159347|2.0|With all of the 5 star reviews I guess I was expecting a really great story.  I found all of the characters introduced in the first couple of chapters to be very hard to keep straight.  I had to go back and check earlier pages to make sure I knew which family they were from.  After a few chapters that problem went away but I found the story to be so very boring.  I skipped many pages, read the letter, and tried to continue from there.  It really wasn't much better and I never finished the book.  It seems like it could have been so much better.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Even in light of grand theft auto five, this racing game has still astounded me. It's like having all the chocolate you could want, but you still find tucked in one small corner a piece of wonderful hershys chocolate.

B004LWZW2E|5.0|This movie is an absolutely terrifying flick from James Wan (who directed The Conjuring, Dead Silence etc.) Must by for a horror movie fan!!!
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I bought the movie for my 6 year old son. He is in love with tornadoes so we are very happy he watches it whenever possible. Thank you for having the old time movie's I grew up watching so can share them with my kids.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Again it's displayed as the trilogy and I only got the first book of the set otherwise it would have probably gotten a five star.  Went and bought the other two later and the series is excellent!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this is one of my favorite shows. Its s must see. once you watch the first season you will be hooked.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read it out of curiosity as to why it was so big.  I wasn't really impressed (but I'm a guy - right?)!  Also by the way it was titled when I bought it I thought this was the whole set but it only turned out to be book 1.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much better than the first one. The graphics are better and overall visually pleasing. Recommend for anyone who loves/d playing the first one.
B008PZZYB2|2.0|I could only watch the first few minutes.  I have never found Stiller to be much of a talent.  Take  pass on this one.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Congratulations Graeme Simsion.  A well written, entertaining book.  I am a medieval history fan and for a change, more recently read Burial Rites, an excellent but sobering book.  So, when I purchased The Rosie Project and found it so different, probably uniquely different from any other book I have read, it was such a pleasant surprise.  Light, easy to read, never boring.  I would recommend this book.
B005544V6A|4.0|Absolutely love the premise of this show, and the characters - regardless of their flaws (which are many) - are so likable. Definitely coming back for episode 2.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Great movie. Item was as advertised. Not cheap at all. Very nice package. Will watch this movie over and over.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Chris's book and its exposé of micro business! It is so inspiring to read how so many people have developed great-paying opportunities with a small infusion of cash and a great investment of time and energy. Thanks again for this compelling read...hope to see more from this author!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun,enjoyable and crazy. Best sequel to Temple Run ever! Little minions running around to get employee of the year. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B008ULM7HU|4.0|This selection contains the most popular hits plus some moderate hits.  Overall, it was a great buy, and most DD fans will enjoy.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book.  Some of my book club members gave up after the first couple letters because they said they couldn't follow it but keep reading.  It gets better and better as you go and you don't want it to end.  The book is written in letters from an author to her best friend and to her editor.  It takes place at the end of WWII and she meets, through letters, a man in a book club, or society as they were called then, and opens up a whole new world for her.  Interesting why it's called the Potato Peel Pie Society, although I don't think I would try the recipe!  The island of Guernsey off France sounds beautiful and I would now like to visit there someday.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I'm sure that other reviews detail how badly the source material was butchered. But additionally, it appears that the zombie plague rendered the non-zombie cast implausibly stupid. Literally one of the worst movies I've seen.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I love this movie so much. Speaking as someone who never felt the book lived up to the hype, I think this film captures both the essence of the book and the magic of the time. It's so well-acted and theatrical and there is never a dull moment.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Well it finally happened.  For years I had joked as Elvis Costello pursued numerous musical ventures that would soon have the EC Gansta Rap album.  This is not, but I can assume this will be about as close as he will get, and it's a truely inspired union.  Elvis seems inspired to be backed by the Roots.  The Roots meanwhile in taking the backing band role, lay down a laidback funky background that fits thes songs just right.  This has the sound of a classic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not put it down.  A great 2nd book that delves deeper into both of the characters and their emotions
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game seems to lag on the kindle fire from time to time. But it works for a free game.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Wonderful movie. I love how they wove it together so it kept you in suspense. Love it. Will watch again & again
B009MYARIK|4.0|This was a funny, cute book. I love to read Sophie Kinsella's books!! This novel was funnier than her others.
B003Z0BWRM|2.0|The trailer for the movie looked interesting, so I thought I'd better read the book first. Turns out both were rather mediocre. I think the basic idea is interesting - I like the thought of angelic descendents living amongst us, taking care of demons right under the noses of oblivious mundanes (rather Constantine-like), but the execution was lacking. The writing and dialogue felt clumsy, the plot was predictable and the villain's motivation not convincing enough. Clary started off as an interesting character with the potential to satisfy the feminist in me, but lost credibility every time she woke up somewhere strange after being knocked unconcious and rescued by Jace, yet again. And as the obligatory love triangle became ever more melodramatic, my interest soon waned to the point where I just wanted the book to end as quickly as possible. Not even the (not very) surprising reveal at the end redeemed this story for me.<br /><br />I don't know if this was Ms Clare's first published book and the rest in the series get progressively better, but I'm afraid I don't care enough to find out.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I loved this movie.  The songs and dancing are very catchy and my son loved dancing along (21 months old).  Would recommend for family movie night.
B000FC10WU|4.0|This was the first Agatha Christie book I had ever read.  I enjoyed the book and will not pass another Agatha Christie book by again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I needed a PDF reader to access the on-line content available through our university library, as well as PDF files of my preprints and my colleagues' preprints.  It works perfectly for that purpose.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Absolutely perfect for a proud, first-time grandmother...  Kindle Fire makes a perfect brag book!  Access to photos wherever I have internet access!  What more could I ask for?
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love playing bingo blitz. The game also has slots which gives you ways to use the coins you win while playing bingo. I would highly recommend  to anyone who likes both bingo and slot games.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie is another zombie movie in warp speed to find a cause and cure to the apocalypse. This movie is an adventure in warp speed.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Very predictable...pretty much the same story as the first one just added some new characters. Don't think I will buy the next one .
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game.. It has challenging levels.. Just hates to having to use my coins to get it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book.i chose the rating because it had lots of action and love in it.<br />I recomend reading thi  book.it is very interesting.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Interesting plot line.  Superb cast.  Great first installment.  This show is not for the faint of heart.  It contains adult themes.  It is well worth the 12 hours.
B005HP2JAM|3.0|It was filmed beautifully but should be a shorter film. Less interviews may have possibly made the subject more interesting.
B001CB4SRW|5.0|It works awesome. better then the leather one that came with my original Leatherman. Stronger for what I demand out of the case
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was an action packed romance and I loved it! I couldn't put it down!! Glad I kept my manthang around! ;)
0307743659|5.0|So I re-read The Shining over this  weekend (21st/22nd Sept 2013)  in preparation for Dr Sleep - the sequel - which landed on my doorstep on Saturday morning, all shining (pun intentional)  and new. Reading The Shining first seemed appropriate and was like having the best homework assignment ever!<br /><br />Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a `shiner', aglow with psychic voltage. When his father became caretaker of the Overlook Hotel his visions grew frighteningly out of control.<br /><br />Do you know I adore Stephen King novels and yet I hate reviewing them - why? Because each time I just want to yell \\"Its brilliant damn it, its King. Just read the darn thing you don't need to know anymore!\\". In fact the temptation to leave it at that and just go and dive headlong into the next part of Danny's story is a burning need right down in my reading soul right now but hey, I'll squash that and do my best...<br /><br />Stephen King. Words are his Power. Yes they really are - now I'm aware that he is not universally loved, and even many of his constant readers have been disappointed in his later novels, but that isnt the case for me. They have all held me captive for the entire reading experience. Yes, even the much maligned \\"Cell\\".  The Shining of course, is an older release and generally well loved by fans of Mr King, so for them I can't say anything they don't already know...<br /><br />For those of you who have not yet dipped a toe into the weird and wonderful world of King, this may well be a good place to start. It is one of his better novels (yes even me, unapologetic fangirl that I am, will say that some of his books are better than others). Its a haunting tale - haunting because Danny is haunted and he is just a child. A child who will have to grow up before his time and understand what he is seeing, feeling and hearing, in order to survive whats coming...<br /><br />The creeping sense of menace that pervades the pages of \\"The Shining\\" starts immediately. Mr King does not molly coddle his audience - despite the rather mundane situation Danny is in when we first meet him (sitting on a kerb, waiting for his Dad to return from a job interview) we immediately become aware that he is different..not your average 5 year old boy. Oh no indeed.<br /><br />I expect you have all seen the film. Jack Nicholson rocked that movie, but it wasnt The Shining. Not really - not for me. The Shining is a tense, creeping, emotional tale that grabs you by the throat and will not let go....the sudden \\"shocks\\" of the horror movie version will not happen here...but slowly and surely you will feel more and more nervous. Hedge animals. Aaargh! I'm hiding. No really I am....keep that axe proof duvet handy...<br /><br />The Overlook Hotel sneaks up on you...what it hides behind its facade would affect the most mentally stable of people and Jack Torrance, Danny's father, could never be described as such. As he descends further into the mire, the sense of apprehension is tangible...clever clever writing.<br /><br />So I loved it. No surprise there. This must be the fourth or fifth time I have read it and its still as terrific as ever and still compels me to read every word and not skip a thing. Ok. Thats the best I can do. I hope it helps. Now...Doctor Sleep is calling....<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!e Shining\\" starts immediately.

B000GUJHD0|5.0|Book is a glimpse into the future of business and social behavior. This book in years to come, many will look back and realize that the author was so insightful, and how many people missed the boat by not listening to author. Many will regret never reading the book.
0064431789|1.0|I never read this book as a kid because I was born and raised in France. I bought the book for my children to read it prior to watching the movie. They hated the book and hated the movie. They are five and six years old and told me that the little boy is so mean and that the beasts are scary. They looked confused throughout the story and when I tried to explain the story to them they looked at me like I was crazy. Finally when we were done reading the book and then watching the movie they said they didn't like it and don't want to watch the movie again or read the book. As a parent I too was a little disturbed with the whole story and after watching my kids reactions to it, I am certain it isn't a book which will remain in my library.
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|This book dealt with many places further south than where I planned on going. From the places I've been, I think there are many more 'amazing' places that are worth seeing.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|This game is def for kids only. I quickly realized I was clearly over the max age limit. Recommend for kids 4-8.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The actors, storyline, and sets are believable yet fresh with a modern edge. Wonderful entertainment and very addictive. Very pleasing for those who love Jane Austen style stories.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what rendition of the movie I was buying when purchased due to price and confusing description. I was a happy camper with my purchase.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Best performances by Bogey and Bergman. A genuine classic. They don't make movies of this caliber anymore. If you haven't seen it, give it a whirl!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I really enjoyed the puzzle solving and adventure of this game. I found myself having to refer to the user guide many times, just to figure out what I was suppose to do.
0792833279|5.0|My brother should actually be doing this review. This was a present for him and is his favorite movie. When he got it, he was like a little kid! He already has watched it 5 times!!!!!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|This is my favorite horror movie. No one other than Jack Nicholson could have played the role of Jack Torrence. The only movie to ever have given me a nightmare.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book recommended by a friend at work, who devoured them as they were a feast of chocolate treats. The characters are intriguing, interesting, and exciting. I look forward to reading the next installment of this series.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Simple concepts that if we all lived by the world would be a far better place. I listened to the audiobook then had to have the written copy to keep referring back to.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Far better than the Paltrow 1996 &#34;Emma&#34; movie - although I enjoy that one, too.  This TV series gives a greater insight into the characters than the 1996 movie did, and I appreciated that effort by all involved in the making of this series.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Enjoyed the book so much.  It made clear to me some concepts I have had for a long time.  Would definitely recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an awesome app and luckily free. its like you can care and love a horse of your own. the only bad thing is that when you first download it, it takes awhile to load.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the best apps that I have gotten for my kindle fire. This has helped me in slot of ways.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Get your Walker fix. I really liked it but found the ending a little anti climactic. Still, great show. Action, violence, scary, fairly intelligent. I recommend it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great book! Recommended for those who were hooked on the fifty shades series also! This is a must read! Yes
1401941893|5.0|My 18-year-old daughter is not a big reader, but she devoured this book in one sitting!! She loves Miranda Kerr and her wholesome look on life. Treasure Yourself is a gem and I hope Miranda Kerr writes more books like this telling girls to value themselves.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Story was well moving and kept you interested all the way through. Very descriptive and it was easy to visualize the scenery as well as characters.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is probably the BEST on TV. Benedict Cuberbatch is a fantastic British actor who makes Sherlock his own. It is thrilling to watch these actors. Martin Freeman as Watson is amazing and the rest of the cast is so good I can't take my eyes off the screen. WATCH THIS SHOW!! AMAZING!!
B000H30B2C|5.0|I loved the extended version. All the scenes that were left out. I figure it was, to make it not to lengthy for movie theaters. Quality excellent.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved everything !! Literally it kept me up Ll hours I the night. so glad I decided to read this trilogy
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like it at first for playing on brake at work but it killed my tablets battery fast so it wasn't good for long road trips with friends but it could have been just my tablet that was bad i will edit this review in the future if i can after i get a new tablet to give a further review
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had an idea of the premise, and I wasn't sure if I'd like the book at all. Once I started reading it, I literally couldn't put it down! Amazing story! Can't wait to read the others!
B008XBHIEY|5.0|This was not my first viewing. I still remember seeing this in the movie theater when it was released in the 70s. First movie that scared me so much, I not only screamed, but stood up in shock. Someone posted just a clip on FB and watching that made me want to watch it all again. A classic movie that has remained in my personal top 100. Thank goodness for movies on demand. :-)
1905236042|5.0|I work in a private practice sensory based pediatric occupational therapy clinic, and we often use yoga to help with balance, sensory regulation, static strength and endurance and anger management among other things. My co- worker had these cards, and took them with her when she left the practice. I missed them so much (even though we have another set of cute yoga cards) that I had to buy some for myself. I highly recommend these to parents and often send home a pose or two for families to work on over the week.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought it for my nephew. He and his siblings absolutely love it and his parents love it because it keeps them busy and away from the tv!
B004GYY714|4.0|Enjoy Tunein Radio, but I do experience times where it hangs and I have to restart. It could just be my connection. I can get most of the stations that I enjoy.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Can't really stand most criminal lawyers and I really dislike most of the characters on this show as well, but it is entertaining nonetheless.
630289915X|5.0|Continues to be my favorite Christmas film!!! Mainly because it shows the essence of human passion and compassion for people.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|So far the game is ok. I am not a fan of having to wait to get energy and have not been playing long enough to actually buy any. I will continue to play for a few more days and we will see what happens.<br />Great graphics I do have to admit. I might be back to up the stars after some more playing time
B009WUBERW|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie. Full of action all the way. In fact watched it more than once it was so good.
B001IF252M|5.0|This product works perfectly when connecting a Mac to a PC set up. Anyone with a Mac should own one.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Great show, fabulous cast. The story lines are inventive and interesting. I've gotten several friends hooked. The best thing is that it only gets better!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Do NOT like the upgraded version.. give me old one back.accidentally deleted app then downloaded again to some new version... It's shit
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I've seen just about every zombie movie out there.  My husband and I were so excited to watch this after the kids went to bed.  We watched it...and when it was over, we just stared at each other in amazement.  It was different.  It wasn't as gory or bloody as the usual zombie movie.  It was lacking the buckets of blood-splatter and the sex/nudity that adds nothing whatsoever to movies. But it was awesome.  I see a lot of people didn't like it, but we certainly did.  The zombies were absolutely terrifying in their relentlessness and their movements.  Brad Pitt was perfect in his father and husband role.  It was an intense and realistic ride and I'm glad we purchased it.
0761169253|5.0|This book has been used in our staff professional development meetings as a way to inspire and ignite teachers on ways to engage students in the inquiry process.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|THis was by far one of the best Star Trek movies made. It rates right up there with Star Trek II and Star Trek IV. The plot line though similar was fresh and the plot twist were great. It is action from beginning to end. A movie for true Trekkers!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is awesome . It definitely passes time and its really fun . I was a little skeptic at first but such a good entertaining game . U should definitely download it .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm not too good at this type of game, but it is a lot of fun. Get it if you like the movies.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|thought it was well worth the price, is very fun to play, and has different characters to take out. awesome
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is fun. need to keep your mind and eyes open. very good for the brain and other senses. great workout
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I love this series of books and the related TV show, Bones.  They are about a forensic anthropologist named Temperance Brennan.  The character is very different on the TV series from the one in the novel series...but I love them both.  This book was a disappointment.  Just didn't have Temperance doing forensics.  She just took over a crime from the police.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|like the boxing. get to chose the clothing, and that's fun so no one can wear the same thing while boxing.
1250010403|3.0|\\"The Sins of the Father\\" is a fine sequel to the Clifton Saga. The writing is very engaging, as can be expected from Archer although the twists in the plot were fairy predictable. If you're interested in a fast and light read, this will be a fine choice. Just don't expect too much.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really love this game but the only problem is that I have is I can't seem to login into Facebook.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have just started reading it which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I have read the other 2 in the series & was waiting for this one to be released. I hope it is as good as the other 2.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|I love sonic the hedgehog and sonic x this makes my sonic love go beyond the max sonic the hedgehog rules so does this game thank you Sega
B000SINT52|5.0|What an idiot Beorge Bush was and this documentary proves it. He was a clown with very little intelligence. How this buffoon got elected and elected twice is beyond me. The only thing dumber than GB is the American people.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This app is my favorite. Mostly because of this one is free. I was so glad when I saw there was a free version. I can't wait till the next update!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Amazing how the US can't have a healthcare system that takes care of all ot its residents. So many other countries can do it. Why can't we?
B007ED9FIY|4.0|the only objection I had with the film was we thought that some of the language was unnecessary.  There are other ways of transferring a dysfunctional family other than having the kids using foul language.  The music was wonderful.  May eventually purchase the soundtrack
B0016K40KY|3.0|This high definition remastered DVD is disappointing.  I have seen the 50th anniversary of Lawrence of Arabia at Fox Theater in Atlanta recently, and I've also seen the original movie, with no remastering, several times.  The DVD version is stark, too clean and too pristeen to tell this desert story the way it was meant to be shown on screen in 1962.  The scenery seems to work fairly well in HD, but the characters have an outline around them, making it look as it they were cut and pasted in front of the scenery. I felt like I was watching a documentary of The Making of Lawrence of Arabia from 2013 technology on National Geographic TV.  I hope to find a more authentic version of Lawrence to watch at home.<br />I have read Seven Pillars of Wisdom twice, and I'm currently reading Lawrence in Arabia.  I'm very familiar with the story of T.E. Lawrence and the Arabian revolt.  David Lean's masterpiece is a beautifully artistic retelling of this piece of history.  It is most definitely a 5-star movie.  This DVD, however, is like a compressed CD compared to a Vinyl recording of a masterpiece in which the fullness of the music is lost in compression  As a history buff of this story, I will probably enjoy the Special Features.  But, I hope I can find a less starkly compressed version of this masterpiece of a movie.
B000ECX0QU|2.0|I am a huge Hitchcock fan but this one is a definite clunker.  Too many characters, too much meaningless dialog and really bland acting.  I can't imagine what he was thinking.  He really made some masterpieces, and I have all of those on DVD at my house. This is not one of them.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I will watch it again, liked how the characters were linked with previous show/movies. It kept it real to character
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Intuitive, easy to use,  cloud access.  I created a text document and accessed documents (including pictures) from the cloud.  Excatly as described.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent plot and excellent legal drama. Love the sub-plots and cast. We cannot seem to stop once we start watching. We like the way Alicia handles things.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|This is a terrific set of tracks from Neil Young's prolific past. It is also a great mix of musical recordings of his own genre from hard rock to simple song.
B002M5ZCEU|5.0|One of the most powerful songs to praise God with. Whitney's voice draws you into the music. The words express full commitment to God.
B00CA6WLAE|4.0|(Spoiler alert)<br />Good book overall but I really really really really really wish Conner didn't have to leave Alex in the ending:'(  (when I say ending I mean at the VERY end of this book) But something tells me that they will see each other again.......
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Whether you are preparing a meal or chopping down a small tree...this knife will work.  While it's not super razor sharp and little too large to carry everywhere it is still a very good addition to your collection.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book affirms what I have long believed- we are all connected and life after death should hold no fear- we're going home.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I find myself going to this movie for a mood lift.  I have been home bound with shoulder surgery and limited in what I can do.  So I watch movies- far superior to watching paint dry.  I have recommended the movie to others, usually they have already seen it.  As I work in a retirement community, I find much of it dead on for the mental trials of older people.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter recommended this book as she has chosen to work in a lab fighting cancer. The characters were heartbreaking but so easy to connect to them in mind body and spirit. You prayed for a different ending yet knew what might happen.May a cure be found to stop such beautiful lives from ending.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is the best!  It brings back great childhood memories. It is also a family friendly show.  I highly recommend it.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|enjoyed watching the first season.  it brought back many memories when it originally aired.  Can't wait to see season two and work my way through all the seasons.  one of my favorite series.  Really like Richard Dean Anderson.  He made a great MacGyver.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Nothing worse than starting a series where there's no telling when the next one will arise. 2 of 3 so far. Let's get on with it. Name of the third book?
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We have a special appreciation in my house for Shaun..  My spouse is English.  All of my children find Shaun to be very entertaining..  They now have all of their friends watching...  We really enjoy watching as a family.  And because it is primarily  visual show, the kids enjoy the action, the animals and all of the funny things that happen...<br /><br />Just another great day on the farm with Shaun & friends...
B004SIP6BI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. chocolate, Gipsies and Johnny Depp, whats better than this?! a romantic about chocolate dance and loving strangers.
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|Decent quality but nowhere even close to professional levels. Obviously without a boom mic and sound crew you won't get there, but this was just slightly above my camera's default mic quality.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I began watching Walking Dead with my eyes covered slightly.  Watching 'zombies' eat is stomach churning but the storyline is GREAT!  I can't get enough of it.  Again good TV is hard to find so glad to have found a series I can look forward to watching.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Great special effects.  Warm, tender performance by Brad Pitt, especially with his wife and kids. But it's just another zombie movie.
B00005R23S|3.0|and if you like Bruce you'll tolerate it. If you love Bruce you'll hate my review. sorry he's another that you have to see in person.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|This is not your typical zombie movie. Fast pace with lots of action. Good plot with just the right amount of zombies. Not your typical zombies either they move fast.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I play this game a lot. My  mommy bought it for me and it was a surprise. My sister plays it with me.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I recommend taking your time reading the books especially the second and third.<br /><br />Parts of the second and third seemed rushed but still well done.<br /><br />I really loved how overall I got a really good picture on what was going on there was a lot of description and detail to what was going on.
0062255657|4.0|like all of his books, Mr. Gaiman makes you ask the question, &#34;Where do these great authors get their ideas?&#34;  This is a good book, not his best but definitely one to pass along to family and friends.  I enjoyed it and, as always, I was disappointed that it had to end.  Now I have to find something else to read.
B004D2CPO0|5.0|I enjoyed the film.  I felt it was a pretty good story of the Yakuza mob that was quite believable.  I felt that the high level of violence was appropriate for the film and that they did not shy away from it.<br /><br />  The acting was good.  Heck in a lot of ways you could have titled this Sopranos Japan!  I don't do spoilers otherwise I would in detail praise the film more.
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|I thought I'd use this app more, but it was more of a novelty for me. Nothing to complain about for the price though.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The director must have been salivating when he ended up with this ensemble cast.  All give superb performances.  The story is absurd and far fetched but WORKS!  Give it a rent and will find it well worth it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game to play! Sometimes frustrating but i have a good time playing it ! Lol hehe ok just get it!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very intriguing. cool concept. very enjoyable read. I fully enjoyed the take on space and aliens with future technologies mixed in with the amazing adventure for Ender.
B006RXPUR2|3.0|ben affleck always gosses me out. morally. he's a rich white man who thinks he can understand what it is to be a truly poor single mother. And seeks to solve that &#34;problem&#34;. Jonathan Swift would have fun with him.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Couldn't get into this at all.  Clunky, confusing.  Don't really need seven more words to say I don't like it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is the best law drama since Boston legal- I can't v believe I just found out about it.  I'm in love with Harvey Spector!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I enjoyed some of the historical aspects of the story, but it got very predictable towards the end.  I was in a hurry to get to the end of the story.  I liked the style of the 2 narrators who told the story of their life on the plantation.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|What you see is what you get.  Works as advertised. Fast turnaround and fun to experiment with too. Just do it!
B008PZZYB2|3.0|Not Ben Stillers best.I expect a really good laugh with Ben. This movie was very disappointing. Would ask for a refund if I could.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Back in a time when Hollywood produced quality motion pictures, The Exorcist gives us something to fear again.<br />An instant classic
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|Disappointed.....played it once and put it away....Born and Raised we play over and over and over again....maybe just our taste. All the songs sound a like....or maybe we just got bored with it......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game I love it fun game for all ages entertaining love itttttttt great game in the minds and keeps you learning
B00005AR3G|5.0|I'm in my 40s and I have to admit, this is my favorite Disney movie, and I think my kids would agree! The adults laugh as much as the kids. David Spade's voice for that character, is perfection!
B00447G2MK|5.0|A great album,their best album.<br />i really liked it,i can stop hearing it .. .<br /><br />it's the best band ever!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is like having an excellent book played out before your eyes. After viewing a season, one wonders what the characters may be doing right now. It takes the viewer into another world.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Ok, first I should tell you I bought this movie on a whim.  I was simply curious what they'd done with it.  I went in with very low expectations and it surpassed them.  This is not what I would call a good movie mind you but it is entertaining.  It would be, for instance, the perfect movie if your 9 year old boy was having a sleepover party.<br /><br />The acting was ok for the lines they were given.  No one had a well written part.  The special effects were pretty good.  It was akin to Transformers and probably as well written.<br /><br />Basically, it was worth the dollar i paid (I had some credits burning a hole in my pocket) but not more.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|This is the first time I'm leaving feedback voluntarily. I got this game for free during it's free app a day. I'm really glad i did, because I've spent hours of my time enjoying it. Would recommend it to any grown up that likes puzzles! Enjoy!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Ordered this to go with my Mac Air for travel. Delighted with how light it is compared to the USB 1.0 and 2.0 devices I've used previously. Since my Air is a 3.0 device, why sacrifice speed? The cost was pretty stellar, too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While post apocalyptic tales are nothing new, the perspectives and quality of story telling raise this one to a much higher level than most.<br /><br />I have to admit that after the first two sections I wasn't sure I could continue. If you read them you'll understand why, but once past them the story picks up steam, eventually turning into an unstoppable thrill ride full of captivating characters and an impressive plot.<br /><br />Howey has done a great job introducing a seemingly hopeless world of the silo, setting a stage for what promises to be an epic series exploring the brightest heights and darkest depths of humanity.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This series is my favorite since it has interesting characters, unique plot twists and good direction.This goes way beyond the ordinary.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was an AMAZING book! I could barely stop reading it once I started! I recommend, it was well written but a bit hard to follow in some parts. If you like fantasy and romance, read this.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The demo is entertaining, but after trying it, I realize<br /><br />1. It's very short<br />2. It's addicting<br />3. Night comes very soon<br />4. There's no explanation of what to do<br /><br />But even after that, it's hard to resist buying the actual app.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|doesn't  work on kindle  I have down loaded it but I cannot get  to play on it so what good is it
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old loves this game.<br />Every time he correctly uses the potty he get 15 min. of play.<br />THANKS ANGRY BIRDS!!!<br />:)

B002WV5A9G|4.0|Pretty good movie. Still partial to motion picture series. I give it 4 stars. Nice to see a story line that shows the beginning of it all
B000W93CHC|4.0|Another great book by Ken Follett! It is a great continuation of The Pillars of the Earth.  It drew me in right away had a hard time putting it down.

B00F35BV64|2.0|Jesus, what a crappy movie. The first Star Trek remake was pretty good but this thing was just a bad movie all around.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought this book was awsome!!!<br />I am giving it a 5 star rating.<br />I would recommend this book to Percy Jackson book lovers.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Just love these books. Such a good story and what an awesome love story.  Can't wait for Outlander the series to come out on Starz.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The middle of this book takes an unexpected dark turn which is a nice change from the all lovey dovey books. Can't wait to read the follow up, Losing Hope.
B00F35BV64|3.0|But it was good entertainment and I loved the new Star Trek crew.  Plot line was a little thin but I'm going to watch the first one now.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Thank you so much for allowing my daughters & I to purchase this CD, plus past CDs.  I love dealing with Amazon with everything that I have (& will) purchased.  You all ROCK!<br />THANK YOU!!!
B00F35BV64|2.0|All I see is the slow death of a franchise in an effort to make it \\"younger, hipper, and more actioney\\".<br />Sadly there was little space opera in this film or the previous one, and it seems that coherent scripting has flown out the window,only to be replaced by more fancy special effects. (ooohhhh shiney......)<br /><br />As for all the \\"trek fans\\" that love this film I can only ask why?<br />There has been little \\"Trek\\" in any of these movies save for characters,background,and similar ships.<br />the scripts have been sorely lacking in the meat of a story.<br /><br />Am I the only person that has a problem with the fact that kirk never really completed the academy, never held down any<br />other command,let alone served any other duties?<br />Yet they just \\"hand\\" him over the command of the newest ship of the line?(would not happen, no matter what)<br />Talk about a reflection of never having to earn anything and things just get handed to you.<br />Interpersonal relationships are and will be frowned upon.(really a relationship spat in the middle of a mission? come on)<br /><br /> I did give a 2 star instead of 1. I felt the casting for Spock,Bones,Scotty and Sulu were spot on.<br />As this is only my opinion feel free to phaser me as needed.<br />But ask yourself this what made Firefly,Farscape,Voyager, Next Gen. (for the most part),and Classic trek popular?,<br />engaging stories. Which is what these movies have lacked. JJ makes great movies but not good trek.<br />Ideas for JJ to reboot: Space 1999,The Black Hole, Event Horizon, any of the old \\"atomic hero\\" sci fi serials come on JJ you can do it.

B008469DGY|5.0|This a great time waster and has taken up a great deal of my time!  Now I have to get perfect shots!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun and responsive game. They have updated the game regularly and it seems to be pretty bug free.<br />However, some major annoyances.<br />-It gets to a point where you cannot realistically beat the challenges without spending money<br />-There are appearently cheats available which the weekly challengers either use liberally or they pay for extra upgrades. I don't see how a person can run 499370m within 10 minutes of a challenge beginning<br /><br />Overall, fun distraction, but in order to get far you must pay.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have read thousands of books, and this is one of the most valuable ever. Anita's journey is beautifully and authentically shared from her heart. It resonates with so much of what I've learnt on an intellectual level and here, she's actually LIVING those principles.<br /><br />I'm a student and big fan of The Sedona Method - and Anita describes in a wonderful way ALL of what's behind The Sedona Method principles. I loved reading every single page of this book and will probably read it another few times - so valuable and inspiring, a great reminder of who we REALLY are.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Liked the character depth and the story itself, a lot more going on than the movie, and the movie was good as well.
B000I0XLYO|1.0|If Ben Stiller had good material, he could make it as funny a Gibson's \\"Passion of the Christ.\\" The drugs people must take to find this guy funny must cost a lot and damage a brain permanently. Or maybe that's Stiller doing the brain damage.

B00DL7TSAM|4.0|Very nice collector's edition. Too bad it is sent in a single non-rigid envelope which does not promote optimal protection of the object.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|There was little plot. Little action and the lead actors were horrible. Not sure how anyone thought this could be good in any way.
0805086846|5.0|This morning I finished reading Dee Brown's great 1970 book.<br />What a story. What an injustice. What a record of our recent European racist intolerance and ignorant, arrogant brutality.<br />I can highly recommend it and I think it would be a great thing if this were to become required reading in our education systems.<br /><br />Here is a story of the 'holocaust' that our OWN forefathers perpetrated, but which we interestingly don't get to hear much of, and to which regretably (and to our shame) there are no memorial museums.<br /><br />The book, and the story it tells so well, is a tragic testament to the 'white supremacist' mentality that we all are heir to and which I now clearly see I was unknowingly indoctrinated with when young. (E.g I and my generation grew up watching false dramatisation TV depictions of 'white guy heros' versus 'cruel savages'.)<br /><br />Reasons why I found this book so powerful:<br />After reading it I realised how much I myself and our whole societies are disconected from nature and the natural world.<br />I was reminded anew - but with more force than before - how we do not value our environment nor respect it.<br />I was also sadly reminded how we STILL lie and deceive ourselves with our histories and our entertainment industries. With our justifications for the destruction and dissipation of our dwindling natural resources which we refuse to share equally and fairly.<br />This book showed me very powerfully how, to an 'outsider', our society's value, it's rewarding of greed and dishonesty and it's celebration of self-centred, economic 'success' looks (and is) quite perverse and strange.<br /><br />E.g. This book relates how Chief Sitting Bull, near the end of his life, escaped from a depressing life on reservations when he was invited to tour as an 'attraction' with Buffalo Bill Cody's 'Wild West Show'. Getting to see 'white man' culture up close for the first time he had the following conversation with Annie Oakley. He often gave away much of the money he received to the hungry and poorly clothed boys who used to hang around the 'Show'. After doing so on one occasion he said to Annie Oakley that he couldn't understand how the white man was so unmindful of its own poor people:<br />&#34;The white man knows how to make many things, but does not know how to share it!&#34;<br />How true still today! :-(<br />I am very glad I read this book.<br />Dee Brown has done our society a great service by doing the research and then putting it altogether in such a respectful, fair and riveting manner. Excellent!e away much of the money he received to the hungry and poorly clothed boys who used to hang around the 'Show'.

B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Not certain that I'll continue the series. I think this book quenched my thirst for this particular storyline.  The End
B0027MJU00|4.0|Very well written, suspenseful book. However - NOT for the wimpy!  Graphic descriptions make for a gruesome read. Gillian Flynn is a writer with so many twists and turns in her novels you need a seatbelt for the ride! Enjoy!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I found it really boring, but I think it was the flashback dossier style format of the book. However, it was better than buying a physical book.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|He has been waiting for this one to come out for awhile.  He says he is not disappointed.  I'll have to take his word for it because he has been playing it non-stop!
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Loved the new disc, and the bonus disc of live tracks! This is an awesome album. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes 5FDP.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm in love with Downton Abbey! But I also love movies from this time period as well.<br /><br />The only downside could be some of the phrases they use are too modern for that time. In one of the series &#34;what's up&#34; is used. Not a big deal by me though! I'd recommend to a friend!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have been playing this game on Facebook for the longest time and I was pleased to find it on the kindle fire. It works exactly how I would like it to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun, it is only 17 more days until the next update comes out. The one thing they need to fix is that you don't have to redownload the game and lose all your progress to get the update.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I really did love this one, and found it proverbially VERY hard to put down. Can't wait to red the next one.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Fun game. Good price for th  full version. It is so worth it. It is challenging but so much so that you will be frustrated.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Not your typical zombie movie.  Great special effects, which I would have preferred to have seen on the big screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Looking for a game where you could survive and build, well this is the game! The new updates get even better to this game (it could also creep you out by herobrine) . If youre wandering whose herobrine, he is a random person who joins your world a haunt you, but that's rare. It also have local multiplayer, but there working on the online mode called realms so you could only play local.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|While the philosophy driving this book, Moran's notion of modern feminism, is strong and important, the execution is jarring at times.
B00BMKGZVA|1.0|Is a good show , but this box set was poorly made. no clear sound or picture. what was a real shame is the seller of this box set has really bad customer service. They charge way too much for a product that has poor quality. I strongly do not recommend to purchase from this seller.

B0019NG73G|3.0|\\"Gettysburg; The Director's Cut\\" has been around for a while. It was shown on TNT a number of times in the 1990's, but is just now being released on DVD and Blu-ray. I just finished watching-again-the theatrical cut. Some very fine performances, with actors being given big set pieces with excellent dialogue.<br /><br />As I recall, the extended version contains a scene between General Lee and General A.P. Hill, who always wore a red shirt into battle, and be briefly seen in the theatrical version.<br /><br />However, some of the re-enactors, especially on the Confederate side are just...too fat! Historical reality: given the condition of army rations, there were no fat soldiers on either side, except maybe for generals. The scene where Harrison the spy rides up to the Confederate picket line and is challenged by a fat Confederate soldier is just not historically believable. Plus, it sounds like that re-enactor was dubbed by a professional actor.<br /><br />Because \\"Gettysburg\\" was originally intended for television (under the title...\\"The Killer Angels\\"), the final act of the movie is a bloodless Pickett's Charge. With no realistic depiction of what solid and exploding cannon balls do to the human body. Let alone what grape shot, canister and double canister do. Lots of smoke, cannon shots and rifle shots, but if the bloodiness of Pickett's Charge were accurately depicted, the theatrical release would have been rated NC-17, the kiss of death for advertising and exhibition. So the movie has a bloodless PG-13 Pickett's Charge.<br /><br />Historical accounts of Pickett's Charge describe heads, arms, legs and torsos flying out of the clouds of black powder smoke and into the air, and whole lines of Confederate infantry mowed down, from grape shot, and especially canister. As another review on this page says, \\"Gettysburg\\" definitely does not have the battlefield realism of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".<br /><br />Rumor has it that when the film was screened in Atlanta for all the Turner Broadcasting  employees, the audience cheered when Ted Turner, in his Confederate officer cameo, got shot and killed.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I enjoyed it so much I plan to read more by this author and more of the Sigma Force books.  i recomment it as it was recommended to me.  Read and enjoy.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Have always loved this movie, but streaming in HD made it seem brand new! Highly recommend watching this movie on a regular basis.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Audrey Tautou is charming and witty in this movie. So much of the movie is based on the players facial expressions and body  movements you will not miss any of the action by reading the subtitles.The story line is explained at the very beginning so pay attention. I have to admit my second viewing was a far better experieence since I could enjoy the movie without having wonder who or what was happening. This is one of my go to movies when I feel like just having a good time for a couple of hours. Ms Tautou has made many French movies but Americans will remember her as the female police officer who helped Tom Hanks in the De Vinci Code.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Fantastic story line which weighs the life struggles of the aristocrat and the working class.  I can't for season 4.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is a great movie about a family changing the life of a child and the child changing their lives by just being himself.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever girls centers around Sophia who is having problems controlling the noises in her head, to make matters worse she has to deal with town stigmas and a strings strange events making life harder for her. The story is very interesting and makes you want to discover the town's secret and unravel Sophie's part in it. I enjoyed being able to learn about Sophie's ancestry and the mysterious voices she kept hearing. This book was a surprise, It was full of interesting characters and complex characters. I recommend this book to fans of paranormal romances.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I am not religious at all, and this book has a fair bit of god in it, especially towards the end. This may explain why I got far more out of the first half of this book than the latter half. If all you read were the first half, you would enrich your life greatly. If you can stomach the rest of it, then read the whole book.  Take what you like and leave the rest. That's my strategy with such things. That said, this book was extremely powerful. A brilliant, enlightening way of looking at life. I absolutely loved it. I would dock 1 star for the last part of the book which consists of prayers, and was of zero value to me, but I wanted to give this book the highest possible rating to encourage everyone to read it. I am very glad I did, and I am confident you will be too.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|Great idea for a show with good characters and actors...but he action is too slow and there's not enough dialog.  Too bad, because otherwise the storyline appears to be well-constructed and thought out..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superbly written. Amazing acting and script. So many characters and sub plots to the show you can talk about it for hours
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This was scary enough to make me scream and hide my eyes, but the ending was a little drippy. All in all, it was great fun and I would recommend it to others.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over especially when i needed inspiration or thought I needed a better perspective on things.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Treasure Island was written 130 years ago and it remains one of the great adventure tales of all time.  I originally read it when I was about ten years old and, fifty years later, I recently re-read it in the Kindle edition.  The fact that the book brings as much pleasure now as it did then is an indication of how good it really is.  Stevenson truly hit the ball out of the park with this one.<br /><br />Much has been remarked in many of these critiques about the outdated language Stevenson used.  In  that regard, I have to say that the Kindle edition that I downloaded lacks one thing that was included in my old printed edition, which was published by MacMillan way back in 1924.  The old edition has a set of notes following the text, explaining a lot of the nautical terms and old-fashioned jargon.  It even includes the complete lyrics to \\"A Bottle of Rum\\".  I never found those notes necessary but they might prove useful to some of the younger readers, to whom such language might be unfamiliar.  Personally, I think the language is part of what has given this tale it's lasting appeal.  In addition, I don't know whether 18th Century pirates really spoke the way Stevenson has them speak in Treasure Island, but there is no doubt that it is the way they will forever be remembered, \\"...and ye may lay to that, Matey\\"!
B000000OAC|5.0|While admittedly I'm not the biggest queen fan in the world; their 1977 album \\"News of the World\\" is simply one of the best of the decade. Queen has always been one of those hit-and-miss type of bands. Some albums are really solid throughout, and then others are lackluster and seemed rushed. This was absolutely not the case with this particular album, and Queen show why their still considered one of the best rock bands in history with this release.<br /><br />\\"News of the World\\" was Queen's sixth album in five years. This is actually quite hard to imagine in this day and age with artists taking two or three years, or sometimes even longer to get records out. The problem with this is, sometimes the quality of the albums suffer, and I feel some of Queen's work fell into this category. However, with \\"News of the World\\" that would be washed away. This album is solid the whole way through, and you can tell the band put a lot of time and effort into writing an amazing record. Songs like \\"It's Late,\\" \\"We Will Rock You,\\" \\"Sheer Heart Attack,\\" and \\"Spread Your Wings\\" are some of Queen's all-time best songs, and the rest of the album is just as solid as well. To me, this is the pinnacle that Queen reached throughout their illustrious career spanning almost twenty years.<br /><br />If you enjoy classic rock music and don't have any Queen albums, then by all means buy this one first. There's no way any fan of classic rock wouldn't love this album, and you just might be surprised how many great tracks are actually on this baby!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I started with my document in .docx format so the instructions (for Word) were straight forward - removing tabs, etc. Setting up the toc was also easy and MUCH simpler than smashwords' version. But I  was only reformatting text, so I cannot speak to books with images. Overall, I would highly recommend \\"Building Your Book For Kindle\\" for the first-time e-book author (as I was when I e-pub'ed my fiction novel \\"The Long Take\\" - by Mark Barbour).
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The acting on the show is amazing!  My favorite thing about the show is that its characters are 3 dimensional.  Not of its characters are all good or all bad.<br /><br />The show is a little to violent for me but everything else about the show makes me tolerate that violence.  I realize that the violence is part of their message.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|I'm not going to re-hash the plot (plenty of people have done that already, and if you're like me, you want to read the book for yourself anyway).<br /><br />Things I liked about this book -<br /><br />1. It features a cool YA main character who is a boy (for a change). From that respect, it made me think of Harry Potter several times as I was reading. This kid is smart. He has family issues, cool friends and isn't crushing on every girl in the book.<br /><br />2. The writing is error-free (a HUGE bonus in kindle-land, as anyone who reads a lot of Amazon books can tell you).<br /><br />3. There's some deep stuff here. As the main character tries to figure out why he keeps having these dreams that are scary-real, and end with him dying, he meets all sorts of interesting people and has discussions about life, death, time-travel, reincarnation and much more serious stuff than you find in a typical novel of this sort.<br /><br />4. Even with all the serious stuff, there's plenty of action. Secret government organizations, plots to save people in the clutches of the bad guys, chases, near-death experiences and even hints of romance (though not as much as I've come to expect in books like this that feature a female lead character).<br /><br />Things I didn't like about this book -<br /><br />1. It went on a little long for me as it sometimes got bogged down with the airy-fairy stuff. When it went there for too long, the voice left that of a young boy, and the voice of the author started creeping in. Still, that's a very minor thing (and people who are into this sort of thing are going to LOVE it).<br /><br />2. The book does end on a cliff-hanger, though the main plot points were wrapped up. Now, I'm going to have to get the next book!<br /><br />All in all, this was a solid book written by someone I'll definitely read again.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Recommended by a friend, I was drawn to the story-very funny but with a serious and common theme serious. Creative.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|It's hard to describe this book in a few words. It's very well written, funny at times, but overall just an incredible account of both the cruelty and mundaneness of war. It's hard to put down, and hard to forget.
B00AQMQBKK|2.0|1) There is no skill to this game at all it is sheer random luck if you complete a task or the whole board, most of the time you will die, almost never will you win.<br /><br />2) the glyph system is terribly broken. You have 1 skull glyph, 1 peril glyph, 1 lore glyph, and then you have up to 5 investigation glyphs. This skews the ratio of investigation glyphs horribly and you will notice it.<br /><br />  When you try to accomplish a task it will ask you for glyps to drop on the taks. You will have maybe 1-3 tasks. You get 6 random glyphs. To finish all the tasks with. Most of the time you will get an ungodly number of investigation glyphs and almost none of the others. This becomes tiresome when you need 6 lore scrolls but instead you get investigation 1, or investigation 3, all in a row. You can change a glyph here and there but not enough that it changes the fact that it is sheer luck if you win.<br /><br />The character cards are flawed as well. Don't bother with any character card that restores sanity or health. It is a waste of time. You will lose more health and sanity per turn than these characters are worth. The only characters you want are the ones that can give you more glyphs. That is the only thing in this game you need to worry about.<br /><br />Also some of the character traits are just novelties. One character can turn 1 peril into 1 skull... its almost laughable how much you will use this trait. Most of your glyphs will be investigation glyphs anyway.  Get the characters that can give you yellow and red glyphs every turn.<br /><br />The art in this game is great that is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.<br /><br />This game needs a redesign... big time. the developers  need to take this back to the drawing board. Balance the glyphs. Balance the character cards. Make the skills better. And mostly make the game interactive... wich it is not right now.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Great fun read!  Evanovitch never disappoints and Stephanie has all the fun.  I would recommend for all.  No more required.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A Higher Call is more than a war story. It is a story about how men in extreme circumstances never forget that they are first and foremost all children of the same God. This book is extremely well-written. Being a female, I usually don't like war stories, but our book club was reading it, and I'm glad we did. The story kept me rooting for both men. I would recommend this book to everyone, whether you like war stories or not.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I owned this on VHS after the movie was first released and wanted to experience it on DVD. This is still a classic film and superb animation from the folks at Disney. The story touches young and old alike. Rarely does the animated world embrace all ages with visual context, story depth, and timeless music as this film has clearly done. The DVD is great and a wonderful addition to my collection.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I saw this product on the Today show & thought it would be perfect for me.  I have Amazon prime that I would like to watch on the big screen instead of the laptop.  I was under the impression that it would play anything from your computer on the TV.  Nope.  It will only play certain file types from Google chrome internet, Netflix, & youtube.  Not at all what I was led to believe from the review on TV!  And yes I see now on the description that it says that but I was going by what the review on TV said.  Not sure if I should send it back or keep it hoping they will add more options later (ahem, Amazon Prime video!!!).<br /><br />I will add that it would be good it you have a Netflix account, so if that's what you will be using it for I am sure you would like it more than I did.
B00821OX98|3.0|Plot is somewhat sketchy at times.  Often quite predictable. When jumping back and forth between plot lines explanations of how problems were solved are lacking.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Was enjoyable. King glossed over the ending...not nearly enough time spent developing the last quarter of the story plot. But, interesting read
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is a great game.  See game reviews from reputable sources if needed.  I liked it enough to buy it on Vita even though I have it on PS2.  And I'm glad I did, because it look so great on Vita, so sharp, so fresh and so clean.  And some story elements have been slightly changed.
B009LDD590|5.0|great way to buy you can watch blue ray , dvd , even ultraviolet tells how all sides worked and hostiles take overs to rule the booze
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Did you know Brody is a terrorist? He's got a Qur'an, but he's not a terrorist.<br />Is Brody a Terrorist? He can't be, watch out Angela Chase.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|much better than expected lena heady was awesome she actually almost scared me and the special effects were superb one more word
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This version is different from one I previously played and I am learning it.  Enjoying it and find it to be very fun so far.
B000002GK1|5.0|Ah grunge! This takes me back to the days of my youth when grunge was king. I actually like this better than some of their newer stuff. If you haven't heard this one before it's worth a listen.
B002EMESSM|5.0|Gene Rodenberry's epic vision of the future of manned space flight brought to the big screen for the first time, if you call yourself a &#34;trekkie&#34; then this film has to hold a special place in your cinematic heart.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It's basically the same as the computer version, and if you haven't played it, it's a bubble-shooting game. Now let's just wait for Candy Crush Saga to be released.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|What a great spiritual movie. Powder was one of the best movies that I have seen. I would highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was hipped to this game by my brother and wish it had not been a limited game. This game causes for you to use memory, common sense, patience and practical skills. Great for the puzzle solver.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Having done some study in theology, Christology and biblical, the set up the statement, repeat the statement, add fact or factoid, garner some agreement and add the directional conclusion.  I like the overall presentation of the Historical Jesus or lack of... I have no problem with the author not being of &#34;Christian' but for me that maybe the fact that  moved this book to sell because not much of what was in was new.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I love the Iron Man series and I can't wait for the Pt. 3 to come out on DVD.<br />I'm hoping for a Pt. 4 soon :)
B005UG542S|5.0|Having read and been to the movies and have them all on my shelf I like this one too.  Harry Potter grew up in front of our eyes and became a nice man who is a wizard.  I truly liked the adventure and sharing it with my granddaughters (who have also grown up to be lovely ladies).  I recommend this if you have followed Harry.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hate this! it's boring once your at it right away and you get bored all the time the bears are so annoying
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I really love this art app! My 4 year old figured it out in an instant. There are so many options - from backgrounds, to materials to use. I got it for free, but I would definitely have paid for this app!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|the game is fun<br />I would recommend it to my friends and other people that I like<br /><br />that's all I have to say
0307730697|5.0|He read it cover to cover in a matter of days and he never reads. In fact this is the first book I've seen him read. It sounded introspective, deep, and very honest from the standpoint of the writer, and a very moving story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an awesome game on the tablet. A matter a fact Me and my cousin Bendy when we grow up we are going to make a show of Subway Surfers with the actual characters and graphics and everything.ps.That's the thing that inspired us both!
B000FC2L1Y|3.0|Great series. I'm rereading it becuase I hear the author is FINALLY writing another book in the series. And I wanted to refresh my memory. This book is kind of mundane.  After all the adventures, wars and romance this book deals with a lot of daily life. Which is interesting and will set tbe stage for events to come in further books. Good book from a great author.
0307593525|5.0|I did so comparing and you cant beat this price!! Good idea for a gift but I'm keeping this cooking set for myself lol
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Love all the angry bird games including this one but where are the rest of the levels? Plus Amazon is notorious for not having updates out in a timely manner or if ever.
0312933541|3.0|Typical Archer story. Easy to read with a fun plot. Not up to his usual suspense and drama.<br />Pleasant bedtime book.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|I cannot change the laws of physics..but Scotty could evidently change just about anything else with alittle duct tape and cardboard.  the garage mechanic soul of this fire stocker nuclear engineer.. or<br />whatever energy they were working with,  crystals was it?  ..  wouldnt that be wonderful?  nuclear energy that does not kill all life,  and crystals that catapult us through outter space.  Outer,  or perhaps inner is the best way to travel.  The second season began with Spocks brain being stolen by a group of women who can time warp,  and whose relationship with the computer far exceeds any the the crew of the Enterprise have known.  This theme shows up quite often,  women who,  with the help of machine,  rule men, or rule astroids,  unground female compounds,  etc,  yet without the machines are totally helpless and clueless as to how they came to be in power.  There are some great episodes.  The Medusa episode is one of the greats, -  no spoiler here but I love that dress.  In this season I see the return of actors in different episodes,  too bad really.  Spocks father is also a Romulin or a Klingon in an earlier episode.  The crazy doctor in one of the two crazy house episodes shows up as the insane guy in a later Prime Directive aborted episode,<br />and the lovely woman in the Medusa episode is in an earlier one where benevolent beings take over the crews bodies in order to build themselves robots to live in.  Spock gets a chance to smile.  its kind of creepy.<br />  Of course my favorite episodes are best for tiny reasons.  When spock goes back in time and falls in love with the woman who cannot return with him. Who among us has not thought of her,  long dead,  trapped forever alone?  Or<br />the Horta,  the mother of her kind,  crying in pain,  trying to communicate with things who see her only as a monster.<br />No,  in spite of the repetitions the second season dug in there with many levels of social comment,  the engines stoked by the ever faithful Scotty who seems hapless in love and yet falls in love an inordinate amount of times for a rather unsexy older crewman,  who seems to drink a wee too much even in space.  The (I'm just as country doctor) Bones' prejudice and aggression at the most inappropriate times,  when Spock is trying to save everyone and Bones is ragging on him that he is not Feeling. lol.  a thin veneer for American nationalism.. be like me or be damned.  well,  its was a reflection of the times.<br />We finally settle with the very funny Chekov and ..perhaps the first major roll for a Japanese American on a tv show . the Russian and the Japanese,  our earthly 1960's  hot and cold war nemesis' - now our brothers in space. Finally our Captain,  cool and sexy,  someone I am growing to love even more as I watch these old episodes. Shatner seemed to give the captain the one thing we all needed,  absolute control and confidence in himself.  For those years were torn and wild,  and we loved seeing one place where everyone seemed to know where they were going, because of the captain. Even the mystery and power of Spock was checked by his devotion to his captain,  and he says as much in one of the episodes.  In spite of having no map,  and in spite of seeking out new life and new civilizations,  their personalities dominated the stars, time warps,  and galaxy boundaries. In the first season there were cries of ''we dont belong out here'  but by the second season they damn well did belong,  and no lost Greek Gods or shapeless threats of insanity were gonna take that away from their five year mission.
B00C5R8364|5.0|This was my first book I have read by this author,  but it won't be my last.  It was a good book really glad I read on Kindle so I could find out meanings for some of the words.
B005HED08I|5.0|T his first episode is a great beginning, and in fact the first three seem to deal with man kind becoming larger than he,  and she,  are able to be.  we have evolved just this far,  and no amount of unweildy power will change that.  I love<br />the first disposable crewman,  reminds me of Galaxy Quests Sam Rockwell character crewman number nine from episode 81.  One reflects,  am I already doomed and so can hero out the episode,  or am I the comic relief?<br />  So much of the series has become iconic,  and I hope the casts knows that We know.  I celebrate Uhura,  and really I marvel at the absolute integration racially,  far before its time,  and I mean integrated that no one is self conscious as so many shows became ,  all the characters are good and bad no matter their color.  There is an interracial embrace,<br />I believe Kirk and his mirror image girlfriend..  and Uhura herself is dignity and sensuality,  and her hands are always<br />on the buttons that make her seem like - more than any other character - she really is 'opening a channel'  Anyone notice how the device in her ear looks remarkably like the prototype for bluetooth ear devices.  ?  And the little computers ship to ship look like the little monitors we would have used in 1999.  What a grave responsibility science fiction really is..  blue prints for the inventors to use as the guide our wee ship through the uncharted future.  I think too,<br />when the series was being taped,  not more than five years after the Kennedy presidency and the famous new frontier..  here we are in the Final Frontier.  The other side of that first step that had not yet been taken when the series was being filmed.  I hope the characters finally have shared in the profits,  because the deserve to be well in their old age,  they are a part and will continue to be a part of our mythology,  the new mythology,  created by film and music.
1416955070|5.0|Great book! As soon as I put this one down, I started the next one.. this is the kind of book that you think about while doing other things and you hurry to get back to it.. lol I don't think this book could be read as a stand alone because you need to read the next two books to get resolution to all the unanswered questions.. I highly recommend reading this book as well as City of Ashes and City of Glass... :)
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I had remembered my mother watching the old Upstairs Downstairs years ago in the 1970's, so when I saw this available on Amazon Prime streaming, I decided to give it a try. I will say that the first episode started out a little slow and I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but then, about 20 minutes in it really took off. I love the characters and felt the show was cast very well. Enticing story lines, and all around very entertaining television viewing. I highly recommend it.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|This book was perfect! So good in fact, that I'm worried to start the next books... This book ended everything in a very satisfying way and Im not sure how the series will continue.. That being said---> I'm starting City of Fallen Angels right now so !!!hopefully!!!! the next books will be great as well. I highly recommend this book and the two before it!!
B004OR199G|5.0|This is my bible of diet books. Kris Carr is my Hero and I am so glad a friend recommended it. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is claymation based on a Nick Parks story.  It is funny for all ages from the kiddos to the adults.  Cleverly done and fascinating take on home farms in GB.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun, I stay up late bcuz I can't stop playing this game. It's good we don't have to continue to spend a ton of money to play.
B00F1BFRA6|5.0|With a global audience of over 125 million, Downton Abbey Season 4 is probably the most anticipated show this year.  This number of followers is set to increase as Chinese State TV has, apparently, just started to broadcast it, although what the average Chinese television viewer will make of the antics of the Crawleys I shudder to think!  This time round we pick up six months on from the tragic end to the Series 3 Christmas Special.<br /><br />Downton has moved with the times, and, as usual, great care has been taken to make the setting, including all the small details, correct for the period.  Hence clothes and hair styles have changed and advances in technology, such as the telephone and even new fangled electric kitchen gadgets are evident.  The cast has all the significant characters who survived the last series, so Maggie Smith continues as the matriarch who dominates every scene she is in, and Shirley MacLaine makes a welcome reappearance after her all too brief involvement in the previous series.  Seeing her sparring with Maggie Smith must be one of the more memorable aspects of this show.  There are some new faces to look out for, one of whom is Kiri Te Kanawa, the New Zealand opera singer as well as a couple of other well known characters in cameo roles.<br /><br />More of the scenes this time round have been filmed on location in London.  Meanwhile at Downton itself, the antics and interaction of those `below stairs' continues to contribute some very interesting story lines and their trials and tribulations are, in many ways, one of the most interesting aspects of the show.  Above stairs initially Lady Mary is, understandably, rather subdued whilst Lady Edith really seems to be coming into her own having, perhaps, been somewhat overshadowed previously.  The producers have publicly promised no more deaths, at least for a while, but I will not be giving away any key parts of the plot here as I certainly do not want to spoil anyone's enjoyment!<br /><br />Downton Abbey has certainly continued to go from strength to strength and has confounded those critics who thought it would peter out after a couple of series.  If you enjoyed the previous seasons then Season 4 is unlikely to disappoint, and there is every sign that the show is set to continue.  I do not believe any announcement has been made about Season 5 yet but apparently some of the key figures have already signed contracts for it.  However, personally I would not be surprised to see it run up to the 1930s in due course.  I certainly hope so!<br /><br />For those of you interested in additional features this set includes 'The Making', The Downton Diaries and New Arrivals.<br /><br />Edit in January 2014 - Just to clarify following a number of comments on the review.  This review was written when Season 4 was released in the UK three months ago.  The set issued in the UK did not include the Christmas Special episode which is the finale as it was not aired until December 25th.  However, this North American issued set being released on Jan 28th certainly does include the Christmas Special (even though it is subtitled UK Edition!) ie this set as sold here does include the Christmas Special. Hope this makes sense.nton Abbey has certainly continued to go from strength to strength and has confounded those critics who thought it would peter out after a couple of series.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not sure what all the hype was about. Maybe the next two books are better, but I am not sure I care to find out.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The Impossible movie was just that! Impossible on how they eventually did the impossible and found each other once again.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable worked just as it should no problems at all would reccomed to anyone who needs or wants one.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was not a fan of Harry Potter when it first came out. I did not let my kids watch it back then. Once it started to come back out on tv I watch the first few ones with my kids because they are late teens then and feel as though they can judge more what it real and not real.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Another great game really loved the star wars characters. I like it for my kids nothing bad in this game
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've thought since I first heard this album that it was great, but after many, many, listens, I realize that it is truly a masterpiece through and through. My favorite songs are \\"Fairweather Friends,\\" \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory,\\" and \\"I Appear Missing.\\"
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Very addictive game. Wish the extra games at the end u didnt have to buy. Other than that awesome game
B00F91SCXC|2.0|The story had too many plot holes and a poor ending for me.  Zombies were scary but nothing special about this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved that the story was about several characters, instead of focusing only on one. The end of each chapter really left me wanting more, so I couldn't wait to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Loved the alternative endings at the end of the book.<br /><br />Thoughtful, fast, good read.
B00CPWTRAA|4.0|Placido Domingo is a force of nature.  He is in his 3rd career: first a tenor, then a conductor and now a baritone.  While his voice may have lost that burnished tone of earlier years, he still sings with power, passion and intelligence.  This album is a joy to hear.  Bravo Domingo!
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|Rating at 4 stars... Highly entertaining. It definitely stands on it's own as a zombie movie. The book is obviously superior but this does not even try to attempt the scale of it. Excellent action thriller.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Took some time (for me) to set this little bugger up but it does function as advertised. It is somewhat annoying to have to use my iPhone or computer as the control device for bedtime TV. Would really like to be able to use my Kindle Fire for that task.<br /><br />The streaming is acceptable. The only content included that I value so far is NetFlix (and of course, that is a paid subscription). I understand that more content is on the way :-)  So for the $35.00 that I paid for for the unit......it is OK
140006922X|5.0|A great book to read inserted with facts rather than passions. Have thoughts for both religious and non-religious persons alike..
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Excellent product, it is amazing to be able to see your little one from where ever you are and know they are ok
B000002MK8|5.0|I love Rod Stewart, so no matter what he sings, old songs, new songs or in between, I love it all!!!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|i get it, i understand the concept. you see, this should work, but no 13 more words.like im writing from some gulag. I love Amazon and will continue to be a loyal customer. i would like to meet the idiot that decided so many words would make me fit in better OVERKILL !!!!! it's what destroys more and more good solid company's these days. Please , this same sharp knife in the drawer wants to give me some tips to view, wow ; even guidelines. will someone lay this guy off already, pink slip his butt, then have him write a report on why he was laid off in the first place.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This movie is a love hate story all in one movie. It leaves you waiting for the next show and the story lines are very real life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson is 8 and I don't think I have to ask him how he likes this one, he plays it all the time.  However, I did ask him and he said he loved it.  He and I take our rating very serious and when we look at games to buy he looks at the number of stars a game has.  (I explained the process)  Hope this info helps.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show. I can not imagine jumping in midway, but we have watched from the very beginning.  The story line, the relationships and most of all the wittiness of the writing is just great!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|So happy to see it has made its way to Kindle Fire! I've been using this program for two weeks on my other devices and have really been learning a new language. My child is in a language immersion program and I don't speak the language taught. Over the past two weeks I've been able to truly comprehend more of the books he brings home from the library. This review is for the program in general.  After I try it on the kindle, I'll update.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|One of Lady Gaga's catchiest songs to date, \\"Applause\\" has a cool, retro 90's dance kind of sound while simultaneously being current and innovative. The song first caught my ear while viewing the new Kia Soul commercial featuring the Kia Hamsters (a very clever, amusing marketing campaign, by the way). \\"Applause\\" is a well crafted pop song that you'll want to hear over and over again. Say what you will about Lady Gaga's over the top theatrics and unconventional fashion sense, but there's definitely no denying her talent.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Very touching and inspiring story of kindness, courage and life.  I would recommend this book to everyone, not only for kids.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This CD was new and I truly loved it.  The songs from the past are great and is exactly what I was looking.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A pebble thrown in a pool of water creates ripples; never just one, but countless of them. This is what this story is all about. An uncle’s suggestion led to a father’s decision, and there was no stopping what happened afterwards. The ripples were so vast it looked almost impossible to trace back to the central plop that the pebble created; but secrets are meant to be revealed, truths are meant to be uncovered. The story played out through many decades in at least five countries among a myriad of characters, and yet not once did I feel lost or confused while reading it.<br /><br />Another masterpiece from Mr. Hosseini, and may I say that in this third novel, he put the notch for himself much higher that it should be an exciting wait for the next one.<br />(less)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game starts out easy and gets a little more challenging on each level. It isn't so difficult but keeps you thinking. The graphics are decent and there aren't any glitches.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I had great fun watching this movie again. It has been quite a few years since I last saw it. I can say that some of the lines and the premise of the story in certain areas  seems  a bit corny. Having said that Patrick Swayze still made my heart do flip-flops watching him moving that oh so fine body of his. When it all comes down to it... Nobody puts Baby in the corner! I still cannot believe he is gone, and yes there were several times I did cry knowing that the magnificent human being he was is no longer with us.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It fun but the controls are yanky and half the items I didn't know Wat they are  and you can't go in to the nether I found red stone  and mined it with an iron pick and I got nothing and I have found a cave also the world is only 100 blocks or so and the border of mining is about 20 blocks down but it a good game except those things  that is why it is only 4 out of 5
B002K0WBXW|3.0|From Ryan Reynolds chiseled bod, to Betty White's awesome Gammy portrayal this movie had the potential to be a truly funny flick. The chances were even doubled when you threw Sandra Bullock, Craig T. Nelson, and Mary Steenburgen into the mix.I loved the tension between father and son, mother and husband and Betty White's goofiness. Sandra Bullock's extreme awkwardness as she desperately tried to play cool was also endearing. Yes there were times when I did laugh out loud, but there were also times when I cringed at the desperate lengths they went to in throwing too many one-liners into the mix to try to make up for the lack of character development. Somehow it just never lived up to the movie it could have been. Please don't misunderstand me, the Actors all did phenomenal with the material and the time frame they were given, it just seemed to be another tired reboot of The Taming Of The Shrew, or My Fair Lady if you prefer.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game challenges you to find a way to get the sugar to the selected points. The method is not always obvious.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Funny, I don't remember the plot of this movie<br />too well. But I'll go to see any movie with<br />Wahlberg and Crowe in it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging game. Makes you look for clues and put them together!<br /><br />Would recommend this for anyone who likes to use their mind!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Sending people back into the past to be disposed of<br />poses a real complication for Mr. Willis in this movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great app. page sync feature is awesome. able to sync the pages I've read on my droid to my kindle.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Ridiculous and inconceivable plot line. Never explains<br />how these four illusionists had time to set up all these<br />complicated tricks.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This movie is more plot driven with suspense rather than the gore and horror usually found in these types of movies.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Pursuit of Kahn again? Didn't we see this twice<br />before?  Another fantastic voyage by the indestructible<br />Trecky crew with lots of destruction along the way.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|If you have enough battery power to allow for it, attaching the LCD Touch BacPac makes the GoPro Hero camera even better.  But be warned, it does suck up juice, so have extra batteries handy.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I want the candy crush game the level guide!!!!  I play on my computer. please work on getting the app for the kindle.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I have seen all the Star Trek movies.  The originals were movies that only a Star Trek fan would really like.  They were cheesy and poorly made, but seeing Kirk and Spock and the gang on the big screen was awesome if you loved the show.<br /><br />The first JJ Abrams Star Trek was a huge step up, but you could tell that while Abrams is an amazing film maker, he was not (yet) a Trekkie.<br /><br />In this film we now have the best of both worlds.  The touch of a world-class director with the touches only a Trekkie would add.<br /><br />I found the characters (in terms of writing, direction and acting) to be absolutely perfect.  Jame T. Kirk without the cheesy Shatner acting.  Bones in a believable persona.  The struggles of Spock in more than one dimension.  And an Uhura like you have never seen her.<br /><br />If you love Star Trek you will love Into The Darkness.  But even if you are not a Trekkie you'll love this film.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I haven't finished watching the whole season yet, the first 2 were good a story on their own so not necessary to hurry into watching the next one.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Granted there are some holes in the plot of this movie big enough to drive a truck load of Zombies through, but all in all its really a cut above your average Zombie apocalypse film. A few notable variations...<br /><br />(Possibly a spoiler alert or two here...)<br /><br />The movie doesn't rely on trying to out-gross other zombie films. (At least in the rated version) No graphic depictions of brains being splattered, etc. Instead it relies on the story to carry it through.<br /><br /> The climax isn't a final, bloody battle to the death (Or undeath as the case may be). Instead we get a somewhat quiet and very tense final reel.<br /><br /> The characters are all three dimensional. No one screaming \\"You go out there if you want to but we're staying right here!!\\" No one going all Mad Max on anyone.<br /><br /> Instead of focusing on just surviving, a lot of the plot involves an effort to understand what's happening in a scientific way and come up with a medical solution to the crisis. Its sort of Contagion with zombies.<br /><br />  Add in strong performances and you get an eminently watchable addition to the zombie oeuvre. (Mirielle Enos is money in the bank no matter the roll. If I needed an actress who could convey sympathy and intellegence with one look my first three choices would be Mirielle Enos, Mirielle Enos, and Mirielle Enos)

B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Good work from all involved.  Lots of puzzles to keep you going.  Totally worth the money.  It's not necessary to be a genius to enjoy this game.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|Very good product. To avoid prolems with the recording, don't forget to raise the volume of the device. I've converted french lessons to MP3 and I can hear everywhere in a MP3 player. I was an &#34;addicted&#34; to tapes and recordings but was difficult to carry more than 5 cassetes.

B000X2H8G4|4.0|Will help my mom and her TV viewing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />it does amplify quite a lot.<br />only one AAA battery needed (included).<br />lightweight<br />can substitute favorite headphones.<br /><br />Cons:<br />at high amplification you pick up a lot of side noise<br />the looks are a bit overmarketed to look like a &#34;boom mike&#34; or spy device. really you can get an electret mic for $1 at your local electronics store and....diy. (but i dint have time).<br /><br />the more i look at it the odder it looks. overdone....as in &#34;whoa! the mic is only 3 inches long?&#34; size matters?<br /><br />but it works.
B00C2IN76C|5.0|Great. An unusual super hero movie.<br />Almost As good as the comic (Sorry Mr Alan Moore- you re the best).
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I do love the story and the sheer epic feeling to the story and the setting and the characters etc--but the wordiness of the prose does tend to muddle the plot and can leave the story feeling tedious.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Excellent movie if you love magic at its best, suspenseful and keeps you interested:)I love the high intensity and mystery:)
0142412147|4.0|\\"Sparkling white snowdrifts, beautiful presents wrapped in ribbons, and multicolored lights glittering in the night through the falling snow. A Christmas Eve snowstorm transforms one small town into a romantic haven, the kind you see only in movies. Well, kinda. After all, a cold and wet hike from a stranded train through the middle of nowhere would not normally end with a delicious kiss from a charming stranger. And no one would think that a trip to the Waffle House through four feet of snow would lead to love with an old friend. Or that the way back to true love begins with a painfully early morning shift at Starbucks. Thanks to three of today's bestselling teen authors--John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle--the magic of the holidays shines on these hilarious and charming interconnected tales of love, romance, and breathtaking kisses.\\"<br /><br />This is most certainly not the kind of book I normally read, but John Green's story was in it, so that was enough for me. I'd never read Maureen Johnson or Lauren Myracle before, so I wanted to see what their writing was like. I have, of course, seen Maureen Johnson on the Vlogbrothers channel. Maureen Johnson's story, \\"The Jubilee Express\\",  is the first in the collection, when Jubilee's parents are arrested for a minor crime, and she must travel by train to her grandparents in Florida. But the blizzard intervenes, and things don't go quite as planned...The writing wasn't great, but it was pretty amusing. Maureen Johnson's stories are so ridiculously absurd, much like her personality. The three writers are very similar, although John Green still remains my favorite. It's kind of funny, because John Green's books always seem to get grouped in with the ladies. Most of his audience is female, and in this collection, the other two authors are female. As Hank Green so eloquently puts it, \\"Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, John Green.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, Maureen Johnson's story was very entertaining, although notbrilliant. It's a sweet and funny tale, and very enjoyable. The premise of it was very silly; that Jubilee's parents get arrested at a sale for a certain type of toy, basically. This changes all of her plans dramatically. It's interesting to think that getting involved in violence would set off this whole chain of events that will impact Jubilee's life enormously. I also did really like the romance, since Jubilee and Stuart have been kind of in the same boat, and they can really relate to one another.<br /><br />The middle story, \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle\\", is by John Green, and is really, really good. Three friends get a call from another friend telling them that the Waffle House has been flooded by cheerleaders. They set off on a drive that normally takes twenty minutes, but in this deep snow, things (of course) don't go quite as planned. This story is connected to Maureen Johnson's in that the cheerleaders were on the same stranded train that Jubilee was on, and Jubilee herself had quite a few (negative) opinions about them. I definitely enjoyed \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle\\" a lot. It was different in tone than the first story, but really funny, as John Green tends to be. It reminded me a little bit of Will Grayson, Will Grayson. There were a lot of jokes in it. It was kind of annoying how the three teenagers took so many really stupid risks for some cheerleaders. They could have gotten themselves killed. But what matters is not that but what comes of it, and it was a very good story.<br /><br />\\"The Patron Saint of Pigs\\" is the final story, written by Lauren Myracle. It's narrated by Addie, another resident of Gracetown, who had been briefly mentioned in both of the previous two stories. It certainly has a great title, and was lovely. One of Addie's friends is obsessed with pigs, which is where the title comes from.<br /><br />I really enjoyed all three of these stories, and I loved that they were interconnected. Each of the stories adds more to the overall picture of Gracetown, and different threads are picked up in different stories. I wonder how the authors wrote the book, but they certainly did it very skillfully. Each story is unique, but they're set in the same place. I loved all of the romances, and would definitely recommend Let it Snow. It's a very sweet book.<br /><br />[...]
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I bought this almost a year ago for my new Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and i haven't notice much wear and tear on it. It's true that i mostly use my Kindle for reading and i don't carry it around with me on many occasions, but from what I've noticed the cover should support that.<br /><br />Other than that, can't say i see anything worth improving for what this is designed for.
