B006CDCWDM|5.0|I was fascinated by this book about Rafa.  It covers his mental and physical preparation for matches, his family life, his training with Uncle Tony, what goes on in his mind before and during big matches (and chronicles some of his biggest wins).  We get insight into what it is like in the locker room before Wimbledon.  There are plenty of examples of his ability to concentrate, focus on the moment and not let other thoughts enter into his mind.  Very inspiring stuff ---lets you into the like of a tennis great!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I can play this game forever its a good one. it plays without interruptions and downloaded fast. the game itself is long so there is always something to do
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hesitant to give into the whole 'fifty shades' erotica, but finally decided to find out what all the fuss was about. I could not put the book down - finished all 3 within a few days. It really transports you into another world. Was looking for more of a story line and got that in books 2 and 3.<br /><br />Ladies, if you're a romantic at heart, this is a must read for you.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I love it!!!! I play it on my knidle fire everyday! its cool....I LOVE TAILS SONIC AMY EEGMAN AAAANNNDDD METAL SONIC
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book. Well written. Captivating story. The heroine is likeable and enaging.  A must for older children and adults! If you enjoyed the movie you will definitely LOVE the book.
B002VHI8T0|5.0|This is an exellent book. It gives the reader an idea of any addict's suffering  and thoughts. I couldn't put it down.
B007THA4FI|4.0|If you enjoy stories that employ the point-of-views of multiple characters, then this novel is the right fit for you. Similar to the 2004 and 2005 films Crash and Syriana, The Casual Vacancy presents the, at-times sordid but most of all imperfect, lives of several characters as they invariably careen into each other in the tiny, gilded community of Pagford.<br /><br />The linchpins to the story are the sudden death of Parish Council member Barry Fairbrother, his links to the surviving community members, and the race to fill his seat. Throughout the story are the conflicts of us vs. them, city vs. country, and new vs. old. While party to those conflicts from afar, readers must decide whether they support the old guard of Pagford, and the pursuit to rid the town of the quasi-tenement housing in the Fields, and the newcomers who want to hold onto the socioeconomic diversity--for better or worse.
B00932AA5G|5.0|It pulls you in from the moment in starts.  When you think you've got it figured out, it leaves you guessing again. Must watch!
B009VB97EY|1.0|I watched this as part of my bachelorette party and well the story was pretty lame and the whole stripping thing just made me want to close my eyes the only decent dancing was done by the main character and all of it was before he had most or any of his clothes off. Basically if you like watching male strippers this is the movie for you but if you are looking for a decent story look elsewhere.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Once again, Rick Riordan has masterfully hit the mark with his third book in the Heroes of Olympus series!  It was a perfect blend of the first two books that answers plenty of questions but, more importantly, leaves you with plenty more.  It deserves six stars! Cant wait for the next book!
B00540G3G6|4.0|This review is not about The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I  am sure it is a wonderful movie by itself. Although, to me in looked very dated.<br />I have a great 3D TV.  Every single movie I have ordered in 3D has been amazingly beautiful to watch.  Except for this one.  I know it cannot  be the 3D<br />or my TV  because the minute it started the menu that says play just popped out of my screen perfectly.<br />There were two choices  play in 3D and play in 2D.  I chose 3D.  But the movie looked flat flat flat.  There was nothing about it that looked like 3D.<br />I am wondering now, as I write this if somehow I thought I chose 3D but did not move the chooser to 3D.  But then why would the menu look so 3D.<br />Please, others of you with the move,  does it look very flat to you too?  Was it a mistake with my DVD player not moving the chooser to play 3D correctly.<br />My stupidity?  Does this movie really  play in full dimensional very noticeable 3D. Because I tried 3 times and each time I could not see the 3D at all.  And<br />I have tons and tons of 3D movies. And always can see the dimensionality perfectly.  I returned it because of this problem i had viewing it. But would gladly<br />repurchase if you tell me I just did not get it to play properly.  I want to know if this movie really pops out like all 3D movies do and matches the quality of<br />the menu before the movie plays. I'd appreciate your help.  I wanted to love this so much.  Was I just careless and not viewing it right?  I did try a couple of times<br />and thought I chose 3D version.  Thanks in advance for your help  and kindness.  Thanks so much.  I gave it four stars for the movie. And left one star for the<br />3D so far.  :)

B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely captivating. The kind of book you think about when you are away from it. The kind of book you set need-to-do-things aside for. I recommend it, and the first book in the series (Hunger Games) as terrific good reads. Am just starting the third book and look forward to it as well.
0316228532|1.0|Characters do not flow and the language was R  rated. I was going to read it because it was JK Rowlling and I loved Harry Potter.<br />I couldn't get past the first chapter and had to take it back. If profane language does not bother you, give it a try.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love the game.  The graphics are excellent.  The brain teasers (puzzles) are awesome.  Living in Wisconsin, during the fall, I thought I was IN the game.  At this time of the year, the leaves are falling, the church bells are ringing and a storm can arise in the blink of an eye.  Excellent!!!!

B00555X8OA|5.0|This a  book for a reader who want to know more about thinking and want to have high quality book which is easy to read.<br /><br />Full of good practical examples to help understand.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|There are enough other reviews of the movie itself, so I won't go into that.  Suffice it to say that we LOVED it.  Sure, you have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief, but the title should have told you that.<br /><br />The biggest surprise for me, after seeing it in the theater in 2D, was the 3D.  Wow!  Definitely some of the best 3D effects I have seen in a film.  More than just perceived depth, there were a lot of things in the foreground - smoke, dust, flying embers, tree branches, grass...and of course from time to time, blood.  The 3D really was not only impressive, but well - used...truly added a new dimension to the film.<br /><br />If you have a 3D TV/Player, this is a must have.  Visually on par with Hugo.  Enjoy!
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Oh my lord, i'd never cried for so long while watching a movie lol. Usually, there's a scene or two that'd make me tear up, but this film, from almost from the beginning til the end, i blubbered. To me, this movie was more moving than the novel. Casting and setting were perfect too. The actress playing Kathie was great, but i was more drawn emotionally to the actors who played the big hearted, innocent Tommy (especially the older Tommy). The film looked and sounded and felt like how i'd imagined 'em while reading the book.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book broke through the notion that we are locked into the habits we have formed.  I particularly liked the fact that just reading about habits and their unconscious hold on us helped me become aware of them and begin to change things I don't like. I wish I had read this book before I retired.

0316228532|1.0|My daughter, with an English degree, said \\"It is a good thing J. K. Rowling wrote the Harry Potter series first.\\".  I completely agree.  This book was populated with uninteresting, mostly dreadful, people doing things which held no interest for me.  After reading the first few chapters, and in order to give it one last chance, I read the last few chapters and found the people were still uninteresting and mostly dreadful.  I have told our friends that it is awful and to not waste their money on it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie because of the non stop action. I loved the subtle, behind the scenes storylines and references. It was well written and I loved the history of the various action heroes. The graphics are so realistic. I loved the way the Hulk looked. I enjoyed Captain America in this movie much more than in his own movie! Loved the Black Widow and Fury. Just great characters all around.<br /><br />My only con is that it could be a hair shorter in length. I thought the scene where they fought the creatures could have been shortened by about 5 minutes...<br /><br />But overall it was great. I watch it weekly and am very much looking forward to the follow-up!
B0041OT9W6|4.0|a diary of a thirteen year old girl jewish girl hiding from the nazis with her family  at the top of a building in a dingy small space.. sounds like a great work of fiction.. yet it is all true,and in the end tragic.

0345803493|4.0|They call it literary crack.... and the definition could not be more fitting.<br />These books are as addictive as they are badly written (the writer might definitely use a Thesaurus, for instance), a real mistery to me.<br />Sadly, Mr Grey even loses most of his wicked appeal as he heads for the Hearts&Flowers finale.<br />I will read the last (sure there won't be more, come on...) episode, of course... on my Kindle, behind my \\"Wuthering Heights\\" cover.<br />Shame, oh, shame Betty..<br />I imagine Jane and Charlotte shaking their heads at me, appalled and disappointed.<br />I wonder how I'll get back to my old, good books... do you have to go on reading this kinky crap (see? it's contagious, I have even started using swearwords) forever once you've started or is there a way out?

B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is the first book of Follett's new trilogy.  It is extremely well done, as usual.  Many characters, thankfully not as many as Russian novels, and many plots and sub-plots.  An enjoying look into American & European society in the early 20th Century.  Follett has no axes to grind on whom is right and who is wrong.  Rather, he is focused on a believable expose of the era and the societal forces at work.  It is not academic or boring - rather, it is engaging and generates thought by the reader.[[ASIN:0451232852 Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy]]

B006RXPTNM|5.0|It left all questions open and on the table; the viewer must wrestle with a number of issues. The movie addresses not just pedophilia, but also hypocrisy, bullying, truth, and one's capacity for compassion and justice.
B007SGM084|4.0|While this very graphic it is a compelling read. From the perspective of a virgin she explores her own sexulaity as well as the darker sidoe
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoy a good mystery with suspense, full of human interest and plots that are complicated. As I read I try to figure out where the story is going...who the bad guy is. Gone Girl certainly allowed me to go in all of those directions and my mind was active as I discerned just happened to the Gone Girl. The moment that what I call evil,became apparent,I was discouraged and even sickened. The book ending sucked it was without hope and not only that but with a sign that the evil would continue, that the life of a child would be involved in it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|From the very beginning of this story I was a part of her journey. After losing my mother at a young age I could relate to so many of her feelings of loss, rage and also of self-destruction. I also wanted to run but would never have the courage to go it alone. How I admire her strength!
0062213423|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! i was never a really big directioner until i read this book, i recommnend it to anyone who likes the band or has heard if them! The pictures are fantastic and i really got to know each and every single member of the band. I cant chose a favortite beacuase they all seem so nice and kind! I hope you enjoy the book as much as i did.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the third book in the Fifty Shades series, and the only bad thing is that when  you are finished there are no more books! I was sad for it to end, but the book met or surpassed all my expectations and I loved it!!!
B005NFJAT4|5.0|Like this movie so much I decided to buy a Blu-ray copy. Never get tired of watching it because of the way it details the lives of so many civil war heros.
B007B8GI28|4.0|It's not for all. I'm not really into this type of movies, but the story is exciting. I won't recommend this for anyone with a weak stomach.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in the Fifty Shades series is even hotter than the first,in a completely new way. I loved it and will probably be reading it again-miss my Fifty!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book keep me on my toes one minute I was pissed off at the characters the next loving them. The thing I will take away from this book is when we stop trying to be out best self we lose out, life stop being good and trys to crap in our eyes. It when both of these characters stop trying to be there best self life turns to crap for them. I really enjoyed the book and already miss the crazy messed up life of Nick and Amy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is wonderful Mr Grey finally know what love is and found the love of his life to share it with.  THE BOOK IS EXCEPTIONAL I WOULD LOVE THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK TO WRITE A BOOK 4.
B005U9REFA|5.0|Ordered to watch with the family. Completely enjoyed the movie which although dated remains charmful. If you have children 6 to 11 this should be near the top of your list.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I have to be honest -- I didn't expect this to be any good.  I've read The Dark Knight Returns probably 500 times.  It's the greatest Batman story ever told.  I didn't think any adaptation would do it any justice.  I was wrong.  They pretty much adapted the story panel for panel.  All the characters look the same as they did in the book.  The newscasters, the lady who gets mugged by the guy who says, \\"Mommy, come here, Mommy\\", the cab driver with the beard and pony tail, the psychiatrists, Lana Lang, all of them... they didn't change them one bit.  The artwork overall was very Milleresque, but they added just enough of their own flavor to it.  The pacing is good, and they scored it like the Nolan films.  I absolutely cannot wait for part two to come out.  I cannot recommend this enough!!
B0053B347M|1.0|This is the second one of these I've bought. First one I bought with no problems, last one had two dead LEDs and I am very disappointed.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! This book is about two people Travis and Abby who are emotional diasters but the love they are fighting for is so beautiful. In order to really embrace this book one must have an open mind in order to fully understand and embrace the character of Travis in particular. This is why I can stand up and cheer their struggle to let go and give into Love.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire wrote a phenomenal story. I couldn't put this book down, and I'm so glad I went with my gut and read this story. This is definitely one of my favs and I'm very excited for the release of Walking Disaster which is Travis' account.

B008BSPQ3E|5.0|As a long-time fan, this box set exceeded expectations. The gem is the So DNA disc that chronicles how the grooves and lyrics took shape for every track on So. Loved all of the Gabrielese (kudos to the team that came up with the concept and painstakingly pieced together all the demos). The DVD and CDs from the last stop on Peter Gabriel's 1986-87 world tour capture the band performing at the top of their game and it fills in the gap between the Plays Live and Secret World Live official releases. The 60-page book does an outstanding job of telling and showing how the record came to be. And the 2 unreleased tracks & alt version of Don't Give Up are an added bonus. Sure, the b-sides aren't here but you can find them easily enough in other places and the live version of In Your Eyes has that much loved extended opening and close (and do we really need to revisit the extended dance mixes of Sledgehammer and Big Time?) Far better to explore the DNA / source code of a great album. It's not too early to start your Christmas shopping -- the perfect gift if there's a diehard PG fan on your list.
078322608X|1.0|There are few movies I have hated more than this one.<br /><br />I always try to give films the benefit of the doubt, but I was highly disappointed with this one.<br /><br />Great idea.  Terrible implementation.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Engineers, Scouts and problem solvers will like this one. This game is not at all like angry birds. If you like solving a problem by building different contraptions using the parts given to you this is your game. You will be amazed how quickly time flys by while playing this game. Try this one before buying the full version, you definetly need to be creative. Works fine on the kindle Fire,  but seems to use a lot of battery. Not sure if its my kindle battery or the game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It grabbed me from the first page and never let me go. The story is so gripping and relatable, both heartbreaking and hopeful, that I was sorry when it ended. The writing is rich and well-crafted. The story is not maudlin at all even though the subject matter, kids with cancer, seems like it might be depressing. It is not a depressing book but rather a wonderful lesson in living life to the fullest, grabbing opportunities whenever you can while realizing that life will never be perfect. The optimism and reality is this book are mixed deftly and I never thought of the characters as victims of a disease but as normal teenagers with real lives apart from their cancer. And the adult characters are also wonderful--no ogres, no cliches just real people dealing with their children's illnesses and their successes. I know want to read everything John Green  has ever written. I can't imagine how he could have created the world in The Fault In Our Stars, his vision and voice are just amazing. I recommend this book whole-heartedly.
B008NABUU8|4.0|great little game. children even enjoy it.  you have to use a lot of counter balances in order to succeed, I don't think an the county would approve of my designs
B003OCFJ7U|5.0|I'm a big Dario Argento fan particularly of his output starting with \\"Bird with a Crystal Plumage\\" up through the ferocious 1987 film \\"Opera\\". While his films after \\"Opera\\" in my eyes saw a increasingly depressing drop in quality that unfortunately continues to this day, those films from BWTCP up through and including Opera are all great films that are just stunning to watch purely from a craft & filmmaking standpoint. \\"Phenomena\\" was released in 1985 to lukewarm reviews as the film was just so out there from a purely stylistic standpoint that many people didn't quite know to make of it. It also didn't help that in America almost an entire half hour was cut out of the film for its release under the alternate title \\"Creepers\\". You had a 13 year old Jennifer Connelly who could communicate with insects, Donald Pleasance with a pet monkey that was also his helper and a dwarf killer running around murdering young girls at an all girl school in Switzerland where the film is set to name a few of the delightful oddities that make this film so much fun. I can't neglect to mention the heavy metal soundtrack that plays along with most of the murder scenes too. The film is also puncuated with his trademark over-the-top graphic violence throughout. While I don't think it's Dario's best film, it is my personal favorite movie of his that I come back to the most.<br /><br />Prior to this blu ray release, Anchor Bay had released the 110 minute Europeran cut of the film first in non-anamorphic widescreen DVD and then with a new anamorphic transfer that also preserved the film's original 1.66:1 theatrical aspect ratio. What some people didn't realize at the time was that there was still a longer Italian cut that was close to 116 minutes in length. For the film's blu ray release, Arrow Video decided to release the full 116 minute Italian cut. Since English dialogue hadn't been recorded for these additional scenes, the film occasionally switches back to the Italian language track with English subtitles similar to what Anchor Bay had to do with their DVD/blu-ray of Dario's classic film \\"Deep Red\\". It's not nearly as as jarring as it sounds.<br /><br />A lot of people have taken Arrow Video to task for their transfers used on their blu-rays of Argento's amazing 1982 film \\"Tenebrae\\" and some of Lucio Fulci's great horror titles. There was also complaints about the transfer of Phenomena too. I find all of these complaints hogwash for the most part because even with the blu-ray's imperfections visually, it still blows the old DVD's away without even trying.<br /><br />The complaint about Phenomena is that digital noise reduction was used to erase some of the film grain which gives the film a cleaner look than people would like. The DNR isn't overdone though and the cast never begin to have any waxy looks like when DNR is used egregiously like the ultimate hunter edition of Predator or Fox's initial blu-ray of Patton. Would I preferred for all of the film grain to have been left in, most certainly. But there is still a ton of detail that is a massive leap both over the older DVD's and the colors really pop in a way that it's truly like seeing the film again for the first time. The difference between this blu ray and the older Anchor Bay DVD is truly like night and day.<br /><br />The sound is presented in two channel stereo which sounds fine. Cool extras include a 52 minute making of featurette, a little over 6 minute discsussion on the original music by Cladio Simonetti and an almost 19 minute Q&A with Sergio Stivaletti discussing the film's creature and gore effects. None of the extras from the Anchor Bay DVD have been carried over including the commentary track so completists will want to hang onto that old DVD.<br /><br />The blu-ray is region free NTSC format including all of the extras so it plays perfectly in all US blu ray players. This is well worth picking up for fans of this criminally underrated film and a great upgrade that all fans shouldenjoy greatly.enjoy greatly.
B0073RQMBY|4.0|Good detail but a bit small and not entirely up to standards for Schleich quality. My 2 year old granddaughter thinks it is fine and immediately included it with the carniverous gang.
0374214913|4.0|This wasn't quite the complex or intellectually engaging story I was expecting after coming across this book in a review in The Economist [...]. It wasn't any 1Q84 or Cryptonomicon, however it was a great page-turner with a well constructed story, likable characters and a good introduction to cloud computing, maker-spacers, data visualization, start-up culture and the inner workings of Google - perhaps this is why The Economist recommended it to it's readers! But, as the book says: \\"If this sounds impressive to you, you're over thirty\\" - and I'm not sure how well this book will age - so read it now!    Looking forward to Robin Sloan's next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A most enjoyable read. Without giving too much away, the book had a surprise ending.  Every woman is looking for her Christian Grey. I will read it again.[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]
0446580848|3.0|I am a big DeMille fan and have thoroughly enjoyed all of the \\"John Corey\\" books.  So of course, I was anxiously waiting to read the Panther.  And unfortunately, it was a letdown.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the plot moved very slowly. It took about 2/3 way through the book for it to get moving and even then...not so much.<br />I don't want to spoil for those who did not read, but I was disappointed by the lack of actual conflict between the Panther and Corey.  Also, while we knew some of the bad things the Panther had done, that was really all we knew about him.  As an American raised terrorist, I think DeMille could have explored his character a little further to show how and why he came to hate the country he was raised in.<br />To be honest, I feel like this book was simply a means for John Corey and Paul Brenner, two popular DeMille characters, to have their paths cross.  Even the \\"conflicts\\" between them (jealousy over Kate) felt very forced and weak.<br />I won't give up on DeMille, just truly hoping for a better story next time...

It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive.<br /><br />There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie.  Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of \\"where do babies come from?\\"  Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse.<br /><br />Objects are person-fied in this movie.  such as the train that talks.  Animals are more like people then animals.  The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork.<br /><br />Commedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children.  I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States.  The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud.<br /><br />My favorite song is \\"When I See an Elephant Fly.\\"<br /><br />Some negative elements:  there is alcohol in this movie.  We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk.  They have a wild vision...
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Here's the whole plot of this movie: A gooey substance is ingested by a guy who has sex with a girl who cuts a squid fetus out of her which then grows up and impregnates an alien who gives birth to another alien that looks like the alien used in the artwork earlier in the film. Other gooey alien babies come along and join the party.<br /><br />This movie has an amusing concept but sadly it is six years too late - South Park already used this plot device in the episode Go God Go. It would have been nice to see Prometheus use an original plot but apparently Ridley and James are huge South Park fans and decided to enact Mr Garrison's explanation of evolution in a live action sci fi film.<br /><br />In case you're curious, here's the Prometheus plot as explained by Mr Garrison in Go God Go:<br /><br />\\"In the beginning, we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this retard frog-squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a monkey-fish-frog, and then this monkey-fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey, and that made you. So there you go, you're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!\\"<br /><br />Hope I didn't ruin the movie for you.

B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Forget all the negative reviews. This movie is awesome!!!!! Halle Berry is in it and Halle Berry is hot as hell and my favorite part is the shower scene where she takes a shower with all the other mental women and I saw some of the women checking out Halle Berry and they have a look on their face like \\"Hey Baby!\\" ;) \\"Ooh Lookin Good!\\" Then Halle Berry's former client licks her tounge at her in the shower. Then Halle Berry sees things and starts screaming in the shower and sees all these distorted faces and this crazy blonde girl who carves \\"Not Alone\\" on her arm and then the naked fat women all start running naked out of the shower like \\"Aaaaahhhhh!!!!!\\" Halle Berry's hot and I would love seeing Halle Berry naked. She's hot and I don't care what anybody says. Then my other most favorite part is when Halle Berry escapes from the mental hospital and is in the room and then the invisible crazy girl starts throwing her around wall to wall and the nurses think she's hurting herself. Then the guys come in and so does the nurse and the nurse wants to sedate her more but then the guys say \\"What for?\\" \\"She's already out\\" Then the nurse gets all snippy and says \\"Don't argue with me!\\" Then she wakes up and grabs the nurses keys and says \\"Stop her!\\" \\"She's got my keys!\\" So Halle Berry runs out of the jail cell and out of the room where the R.A. was about to close the door but she's fast enough and kicks the door before the R.A. closes it and then she runs up the stairs and on the basement running as fast and carefully as she can and then runs to a fense area and the Nurses found her but falls to the lower floor and then runs in the swimming pool room and she has to hide and hold her breath underwater to hide from the Nurses, Security guards, & R.A's and once they get out Halle Berry sees the crazy girl under water and screams right after the security guard left the room. Then she runs to the front desk and right when the lights the front dest guy sees her but decides to help her by giving her his keys and then she runs out of the mental hospital and drives away and a song plays and a guy singing \\"Disconnected!\\" Then Halle berry drives as fast as she can and goes over 100mph and as she sees a train passing by she can't slow down and so she's holding on to her life and suddenly barely passes the train with the side reavue mirror smashed off and almost falls over a cliff and stops the car and then Halle Berry screams \\"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!??\\"<br /><br />I love this movie and would watch it over and over because I love seeing Halle Berry's naked body and the shower scene and the part where she escapes from the mental hospital. This movie is excellent!

I liked them so much I bought 2 of the photos in this book from his website littlefriendsphoto.com and one \\"on land\\" print.  Ive seen much of his other work (including a spread in the NY times the other day involving fish in Alaska) and in case you are wondering this guy is NOT a one hit wonder and he has amazing talent in all different styles of photography. I saw him the other day on \\"the insider\\" and he seems like a cool guy (especially the tall hair- i bet he does a great impersonation of Ace Ventura.) Hopefully he comes out with another book soon.

B005P4PAZG|1.0|My wife accidentally purchased the digital copy of season 5 Big Bang Theory thinking that she was buying the DVD's.  No problem, right....WRONG.  We have been trying to download the movies so that we can play them on our PC but have no idea where they were supposedly downloaded too.  This site is horrible and leads me to ask the question, why is Amazon trying to compete with iTunes?  They obviously have morons designing their site and this service!!!!<br /><br />It now shows that we have downloaded 1 of 2 copies, but we haven't downloaded anything.  At this point I'm scared to select anything because it will tell me I've downloaded 2 of 2 and I will have spent nearly $40 on something that I will never see.<br /><br />AMAZON, get out of the business of downloading movies, music or anything else...you have been totally outclassed by the REAL PROFESSIONALS at APPLE!!!!!  Your site is hard to navigate and that's putting it lightly.
B000002MT0|5.0|It would likely be hard pressed to find any part of Prince's career more enigmatic and provocative as the mid 1990's. The man was dealing with not only a battle for creative autonomy from Warner Brothers because apparently,he didn't have as much control over the financial aspects of his music than we actually thought.  At the same time there was a personal change occurring within him and these two factors came together in a name change to an unpronounceable symbol that would begin his liberation from the excesses of the recording industry. This decision earned him a lot of negative attention in the press. And commercially? Well it was almost the musical equivalent of \\"jumping the shark\\". But Prince was on a mission,away from his name and himself and this album,clocked in artwork resembling a gravestone reflected this mission. Musically however,it's a whole other story. There's been so much time passed since I fully absorbed this that I forgot what a funky album this actually was.<br /><br />  Likely recorded during his 1993 battle with Warner's from the production values of it,the title song features a 10 minute JB type horn funk send up with some production nods to the jazz-hip-hop fusion of the day. Really a very musically incredible tune. \\"Pheromone\\" and \\"Papa\\" are every bit as funky,while both taking on very dark and serious issues such as (what sounds like) cocaine in the former and (definitely) child abuse,very explicitly in the latter,with Prince stating at the end \\"Don't beat your kids or they'll end up like me\\". \\"Space\\" is rather a melodic 90's variation on funky-soul,not outside the spectrum of what TLC were doing at this particular time. \\"Loose!\\" is one of the most musically aggressive songs Prince has ever done with it's mixture of industrial house and speed metal.  \\"Race\\" again finds Prince in his hip-hop/funk places with another strong number,this time taking on the issue of race in a more direct manner than before,even taking on the whole \\"our blood is the same\\" racial universalism concept head on. \\"Letitgo\\" explores similar territory only with a tad bit more of a deeper bottom. \\"Dark\\" is an excellent contrast,a warm and melodic retro-southern soul ballad with lyrics that couldn't be more opposite.<br /><br />  \\"Solo\\" finds Prince poetically musing in near acappella cries and growls over a harp like sound while the ending \\"Orgasm\\" is...well too descriptive in it's graphic depiction of voyeurism. But that's nothing new for Prince is it?  I've heard this album be accused many times of being derivative, boring and an album released only to fulfill a contract and embark on his own creative pursuits . Honestly I'm not sure how Prince could do that. It's just not part of his musical ouvre. And he doesn't do it here one bit. It's no accident that he at last decided to release his shelved 1987 recording [[ASIN:B000008JLN Black Album]]' this same year. On the crawl up into middle age at this point,aside from the personal changes he was dealing with Prince was in a position to put his music back in the harder funk direction he began his career with. Not only that but again he was playing up the somewhat darker side of his emotional and carnal fantasies much the same as he had in the late 80's.  And that's what he did with this album as well.s the same\\" racial universalism concept head on. \\"Letitgo\\" explores similar territory only with a tad bit more of a deeper bottom. \\"Dark\\" is an excellent contrast,a warm and melodic retro-southern soul ballad with lyrics that couldn't be more opposite.<br /><br />  \\"Solo\\" finds Prince poetically musing in near acappella cries and growls over a harp like sound while the ending \\"Orgasm\\" is...well too descriptive in it's graphic depiction of voyeurism.

B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbra is still at the tip of my list for song delivery. The music and her emotion merge into soul stirring melody.
B003D83DPA|5.0|.....get back here and buy this thing.  I'm totally blown away!  I have the Blu-ray version, and while I wouldn't know the diff between the Blu-ray and DVD versions (others have reviewed that aspect), I can attest to the amazing sound quality.  I have not setup my surround system, but listened to it on my Bose headphones with the Blu-Ray player set to 5.1 and Straight through my Yamaha Receiver.  My ears are still ringing!  Yes, I'm not a techie, but it sounded awful good to me.<br /><br />The Bonus Features are just awesome too.  Actually for me the bonus was the feature.  Whereas I remembered every riff....every snap....every pluck of the strings.....every beat of the drums....every bar of a rhyme....every strange sound out of MK's throat on the Alchemy feature, the bonus documentary showed some excellent variations I had never heard.  The version on the documentary of \\"where do you think you're going\\" is just absolutely mind blowing and put the icing on the cake for me.<br /><br />I have always been a HUGE Dire Straits fan, but having grown up in parts of the world where behind the scenes access was impossible, this documentary brought a whole new dimension to life for me.  The group come across as unassuming and you see them putting compositions together.  But it's really cool to see those bits and pieces and then the final product is mind bogglingly perfect and genius.  I come out of it thinking, \\"you mean THESE guys did THAT?  Holy Smokes!\\"  Coolness existed off stage even in 1983.  Dire Straits do not come across terribly \\"cool\\" in the documentary.  But on stage, Mark Knopfler is the definition of coolness.  In control.  No hurry.  Supreme confidence.  There to deliver.  And especially in the documentary....in the moment.  Consumed by his passion.  The rest of the band followed suit.<br /><br />Although it is not overtly discussed, the documentary allows comparisons between Pick Withers vs Terry Williams and David Knopfler vs Hal Lindes.  Things that are notso obvious just listening to the CDs.<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase.  A must buy for anyone who loves or loved Dire Straits.  Yes the video is old school.  I guess I can't expect that to change.  But that's just it.  The music never disappoints.  They were a band.  They weren't (really) making movies!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I would have to say that I am on the boat of SPN fans who are not overly fond of this season. However, it is still thoroughly enjoyable. The worst thing you can do is to compare it to the first seasons (which I think set the bar too high). But, Leviathans and all, this is a good season. And hey, you can't go wrong with this show so long as Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are still in the lead. They really hold the show together, though there are still a lot of amazing side characters (Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel, to name a few favorites). If you love this show and own seasons 1-6, then you're obligated to get Season 7. It's worth it, I promise. And if you were like me and cringing with each episode as it premiered on TV, they are much better a second time around when your expectations aren't so high.<br /><br />As far as the product itself, I am happy as usual. The cover design is a little better than the somewhat odd photoshopped picture on Season 6, and the packaging is simply pleasing on the eyes. It has a gag reel (as it should!) as well as some deleted scenes for some episodes and a fun outtake of Jensen singing an alternate version of Air Supply's \\"All Out Of Love.\\" Friggin' hilarious and makes the entire collection even more worth it. However, it was missing one thing that I was sure would be included in the DVD. There was a joke outtake posted by the CW some months before the release of the DVD of a scene from \\"The Mentalists\\" where Sam (Jared) is doing his exercises and such in a hilarious way while continuing the serious dialogue, and Jensen all the while miraculously keeping a straight face. I loved it so much, but I haven't found it on the DVD. If it's there, then I stand corrected.

0446343129|3.0|Interesting concept. I do believe that sugar does more harm than good. I want to get right into the facts but this book is difficult to read. I made the mistake of googling the author and reading about his wife, Gloria Swanson who was his informant about the ill effects of sugar. I discounted what she says because she seems crazy due to her bio (married 5 times). I will try to read this book again but I want more of a diet plan and hard facts.

It started out a bit slow for me but I quickly became interested, and although I was a bit disappointed at the ending, I came around and it did make sense to end it that way. I'm planning on reading many more of Spark's books.

B005LAJ212|5.0|Cmon, who in their lives have not secretly dreamed of getting even with all those who have wronged them.  I know I have but I also know that revenge brings satisfaction but only momentarily.  I will say that I wanted to watch the show because of the name REVENGE.  I hadn't really seen any of the advertisement but decided to give it a try and like two of my other favorite shows, Grimm and Once Upon A Time, I was hooked.  The whole show revovles around a girl named Amanda Clarke AKA Emily Thorne who has the means ($$$, help from outside sources and the determination) to get revenge on all of those who framed her father for being a traitor by funding money to a group of terrorist that blew up an airplane full of innocent people.<br /><br />This show works for me because Emily is so darn smart, cunning, focused and she lets nothing stand in her way although I wouldn't call her completely cold and calculating.  She does have a heart even if she has a hard time showing it.  Although the show is deemed a drama, there is many comedic moments provided by Nolan (Emily's partner in crime and billionaire).  Of course what show like Revenge could prosper without villains, in this case Victoria and Conrad Grayson to start of with.  I must admit that I have never seen a couple who double cross each other as much as they change their underwear.  LOL.  You will find it easy to hate Victoria as she is to me the biggest villain of them all (watch the show and you'll know what I mean).  After the first few episodes, I wanted to slap the smirk off her face.  Now you know it is a great show when a character can evoke that much emotion.<br /><br />Of course what show would work without a love triangle.  There is Daniel Grayson (privileged son of the Graysons-spoiled brat at times) and Jack Porter (Amanda's best friend before tragedy struck) now owner of the local bar.  They are both so cute but of course there is no contest.  Just like in the Twilight series (Team Edward vs Team Jacob), I'm on Team Jacob and so it is with Revenge.  If there was a Team Daniel vs Team Jack, I would pick Jack all the way.  A good heart goes a whole lot further than a fat wallet.<br /><br />Of course there are many side plots but what is great about this show is how everytime you think you know how \\"low\\" the Graysons will sink (and they have sank lower than the Titanic) in order to save their good name, they will go and do something equally obnoxious and always spin things back to their advantage.<br /><br />Don't bet on the Graysons though, Emily is a very resourceful girl and has a knack of getting herself out of trouble with the help of a few but namely Nolan (love him).  I watch this show because it is by far the most engrossing show on TV and I want to see how far the Grayson conspiracy goes and what Emily will do to exact revenge for her loved ones.  I must admit I don't advocate revenge but In Emily's situation, I think I might have done the same.<br /><br />Season Two just started and oh boy,,,,,I won't spoil the surprise only to say that there are plenty of surprises ahead (no pun intended).<br /><br />Please feel free to comment on my review and or the show.'m on Team Jacob and so it is with Revenge.

B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie is a great example of a movie with great visual impact, but unfortunately, I felt it lacked in the story and depth of characters. Some of the scenes are so interesting in their cinematography that you sometimes forget there is no real plot! Ok, I might be exagerating. However, at times it felt forced to contain many unnecessary characters and plots. Is there really a need for fairies in the story? Possibly not. I wanted to like this film, but unfortunately the only really exciting parts were those with great special effects.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Rented this b/c of all the hype. What a disappointment. I was almost uncomfortable watching it all. It seems like the best filming was during the stripping/dancing, and then the rest was low budget, fairly poor acting. I like C.T., I think he has skill...in this movie, he is just the meat. Matthew McCaughnehey was over-acting the entire film. Storyline was extremely predictable, and the ending was...well, what ending really? It's almost as if the writers just threw in a \\"love story\\" plot without taking the time to develop it, then the end comes and all of a sudden two people end up together? I could've skipped the flick. I've never reviewed a movie until now...just wanted to forewarn people. Wait till it's free for Prime Members!

B008WCP2PG|3.0|I will have to say that \\"Magic Mike\\" is one of the most depressing movies I've ever watched.  Channing Tatum plays the title role of a male stripper, who tries to pursue the American dream during the day, e.g. owns a roofing company and designs avantgarde furniture, but strips at night--I'm thinking because that's where the money really is.  He cannot get credit to pursue his entrepreneur dreams, beds as many women as he can (never even remembering their names), and believes there isn't a person he can't literally charm the pants off of.<br /><br />His dancing buddies are managed by Matthew McConaughey, who train them in the fine art of jiggling their junk in the faces of drunken females.  McConaughey's character is despicable; his performance very noteworthy.  Mike meets Adam (played by Alex Pettyfer), a 19-year old out-of-work, hot headed, unemployable mess and soon they become friends.  Mike talks Alex into stripping one night, Alex enjoys it tremendously, and soon is being groomed to be the new, YOUNG version of Magic Mike.  Along the way, he falls prey to every vice that could be associated with stripping:  womanizing, drugs, self-abuse--it's all in there.  There is another character in the entourage of this all male review.  His stage name is \\"Tarzan,\\" and the role was played by former WWE wrestler Kevin Nash.  He is (by far) the oldest of the lot, and I could only imagine his backstory.  Perhaps if director Steven Soderbergh would have delved into how pitiful it must be to be in your 50s--and STILL stripping--that would have made for a better story.  But that's not gonna' happen; there are too many young buff bodies to show off here.  I did not for one second buy the obvious sell of the romance between Mike and Adam's older sister.<br /><br />Rumour has it that this story was based on Channing Tatum's own experience with stripping when he was growing up in Florida.  I'm sure to some men that scenario must seem like heaven:  all the women, drugs, and alcohol you can have--and you get to shake your bon-bons at night to a packed house of boozed-up, drugged out women.  Thanks...but NO.<br /><br />Magic Mike is rated R for language and nudity.  It was directed by Steven Soderbergh.ou can have--and you get to shake your bon-bons at night to a packed house of boozed-up, drugged out women.

B007L96VCY|4.0|Definitely not my favourite Macca's album, but some very stuff in it, though. Worth buying after those of the 73-76 and 82-90 periods which ARE those I mostly love.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|The series overall is reprehensible, sinful, wicked, and AWESOME. This season is no different. The characters and their internal struggles get under your skin and you feel the discomfort through the television. I was on the edge of my seat and biting my nails the whole time. I have purchased all 6 seasons as Instant Video and love the ease, quality, accessibility, and utter lack of clutter.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|I knew this movie would be eye candy for girls but I was holding out hope that there might be a decent if somewhat cliche story. Yeah it was very predictable and you could see the plot points from a mile away but hey it had enough to be a serious movie.<br /><br />Ugh what a complete joke. The movie had no direction what so ever. Stories and characters that lead to nothing and have no resolution what so ever. It was a joke really. It's a pot of different ideas with no where to go or tie them together and it's all left unsolved. Almost like a rated R Chayote Ugly but with dudes. I think Strip tease might have a better story than this.<br /><br />So in other words. Unless your a girl, gay or a really really unlucky guy who got roped into seeing it by his evil wife/gf/friend then please avoid at all cost.
B007K8ILUQ|5.0|Finally the long forgotten first film by the legendary director Stanley Kubrick has been released on a home video format for the first time and it is truly a sight to behold.<br /> There was believe it or not a time when Stanley Kubrick wasn't one of the biggest names in film history, Yes, that's right, Stanley Kubrick, a man who's Career in the industry has no equal started out as a nobody who had to raise funds from family and friends to start production on what would be his first full motion picture, and like most directorial debuts, it was a box office failure, even after having been given high praise by some notable critics at the time, audiences just didn't care for it.<br /> It's been said many times that Kubrick was before his time, and the same can be said about this film. At a mere 60 minute's, it is by far Kubrick's shortest movie, and lest polished, but contained in it's short run time are the ideas that gave birth to the style of film making that Kubrick continued to used and hone throughout the remainder of his career.<br /> My personal thought's about the film the first time i watched it(this was many years ago) were that of the audiences, i didn't see anything of the man that Hollywood considered one of it's best. Now Many years latter and after several reviewing's i've realized that i was so so wrong. It's easily understandable for a person to say that a older low budget film like this sucks when they've seen films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, you have to look at this film a little more deeply to see the true skill of it's creator at work.<br /> Throughout the rest of his life Kubrick shunned this film, was embarrassed by it, he even tried buying up as many original film prints as he could find, with the plan of preventing it from ever being seen again. Thankfully he didn't get them all, and now it has been beautifully restored in high definition and released for the world to enjoy and to see first hand how one of the greatest directors of all time got his start. If you are a Stanley Kubrick fan then you must own this film, cherish it, and be happy it still exists.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Ending was a little weak and left me hanging a bit.  Very interesting subject, pretty well written but a little vague and ambiguious in developing characters.
B007L6VR6M|1.0|I thought this movie was great, but I will NOT purchase a bluray DVD where the producers are so miserly that they include no special features what-so-ever. In this day and age an anemic offering such as this is simply unacceptable and I won't buy it.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very addictive. My daughter is always taking my phone to play it. Just wish I could put it on her nextbook.
B000ZPPS0W|1.0|The booklet's print is quite small. nearly impossible to read. I originally tried to order the 2007 perf with the 3 and Bonham's son.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|Book one in this series, Uglies, was an enjoyable enough beach read. It wasn't great literature (the author seems determined to never use a word that would send even the shakiest reader to the dictionary), but there is a place for \\"junk-food\\" books in this world. Uglies is the sort of book that one reads to relax after Crime and Punishment or The Grapes of Wrath. It's like pulp fiction: it offers comfortable, escapist, insubstantial fun. And it was fun
B0052RDHTM|3.0|The book is great for historical fiction, but too heavy and detailed on WW1 facts to interest me.  Since I paid for the book I read it till the last big chapter.  Then I scanned pages for interesting sections to the end.  Excellent research and author especially if you enjoy military details.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I never thoroughly enjoyed games where I had to rely on unattainable objects such as gems and items in rooms that never appear. What a drop rate! It's quite frustrating.
B009G8GRX6|2.0|I'm an enormous Muse fan.  I feel that many of thir songs... Hell, MOST of their songs are a touch of genius,  and unbelievably deep,  rich,  complex,  over-the-top,  and off the chain.  But The 2nd Law only contains 4 songs I feel that way about.  I love Supremacy,  Madness, Survival,  and The 2nd Law: Unsustainable.  Sadly,  the rest of the album is horrible. I've tried to let the other tracks grow on me,  but they're so difficult to listen to.  So much so,  that I wouldn't have even been able to tell they were Muse songs if I didn't know I was listening to their album.<br /><br />But I love Muse so much that even this horrible album can't ruin the band for me.  They're just too amazing,  and if there is any possibility that a subsequent album could possibly be as good as any of the previous albums (except Showbiz... Only like 3 songs on that one) then I'm sticking with them.  Muse is still amazing.... But The 2nd Law is not.<br /><br />However,  I still recommend anyone who likes Muse to listen to this album,  and see if you love it or hate it.  I don't think there's much in between,  but what do I know?  I only have been listening to them for 10 years and own all of their albums.  ;-)  So check it out,  and see what you think..... Or at least go on to Amazon MP3 and download the ones you like.

B00884GR0W|4.0|I have both minecraft and this and overall I like block story more.  the graphics are a little better and so is the gameplay.  however there are a few things that need some improvement.  for example water and lava do not flow at all and that is something I would personally like. to see as it is annoying that you cant channel either.  also random skyoceans aorta mess things up sometimes for me when trying to get from island to island and then randomly drowning.  the infinite world is both cool and cumbersome, yes it is vastly big but it becomes harder to find certain items that you need to progress on the quests.

0763619779|4.0|This is such a lovely story. Willy is a lonely chimp, picked on by others when he literally bumps into Hugh Jape (great name!) in the park one day and his whole life is changed. He has a friend.<br /><br />Friendship is always a good theme for children's books and this works on many levels. Willy is no longer lonely, and when Buster arrives on the scene Willy finds he has a friend who will stand up for him and look after him. They enjoy sharing time and experiences together and best of all Willy even gets to reciprocate and help Hugh when he finds a `terrifying creature'! As an adult reader you can spot a whole host of subtleties in the writing that you could talk about with your child if you so wished.<br /><br />There are great touches of humour in the story and in the illustrations. The pictures are really well done, adding much to the text in the way only good illustrations can.<br /><br />Verdict:This is a brilliant read and a fun book to share.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|We liked season 1, but found the twists and turns in season 2 to be even better.  Worried it is headed in a dark direction and hopeful it is not.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|It was a great book even though you know the story.  Seeing it from a different angle was what made it interesting.
0679720200|4.0|Written by a French existentialist (at least at the time he was) and in an american style. Camus tried to make his main character without a conscience in the first half of his book. The main character has a short character arch and comes across as very shallow and indifferent.<br /><br />But the beauty is in the details. Meursault finds himself pitted against a world that fails to understand who he is. Sometimes his appetites for physical pleasure clouds his senses and dictates his reactions; he is brave enough to admit this. The last ten pages or so is what makes this book what it is. The build up of the character of a man who is amoral, yet kind, and a man who still enjoys the company of others. In the last moments he spends with the chaplain, a man who he has refused to see 4 times but that comes anyway, Meursault finds himself through Nietzsche's expressions. Of course the book itself makes no explicit references to the german philosopher, but the words used by Meursault does. And at last, when the chaplain is ripped from Meursault's grasp Meursault realizes what he lives for. He lives for the moment, the excitement, the boredom, the life he made--because he himself did make it. The chaplain, has killed himself for a world that is only present in the minds eye, no reality of which is being or can be experienced.<br /><br />This book is for those exploring classical literature; for the existentialist; for the philosophers.
1451695195|5.0|I must say that this book offers a compelling description of a profound spirtually transforming experience. But to assert that such an experience is proof of heaven and God goes a bit too far. I have no doubt that Dr. Eben experienced something profound and life-altering that defies a reductionist explanation.  However, like many of the great mystics of history such experiences, and their descriptions, need to be evaluated in the light of the understanding that they are impossible to describe in this-worldly concepts. Dr. Alexander makes this point in his book. What anyone sees in a vision is only a partial revelation at best. For believers, God is so much more than our capacity to understand and articulate in human language. Certainly, Dr. Eben makes this point. Our language and concepts can only approximate our encounter with the Divine.  Whatever we experience in a profound spiritual experience will always be a glimpse of the Divine that we can only fully come to experience when we cross the threshold of death into the new life.  Nevertheless, this account by Dr. Alexander bears careful study and discussion by all people, especially those of various religious traditions.  He does not claim to give an exhaustive description of the new life, only a description of what HE went through. So we ought NOT expect him to use a langauge that may be solely that of a particular religious tradition.  After all, since God is the Absolute Mystery we know that our language has to be stretched when speaking about God for God is always going to be more than we can understand and describe. Our languiage is always provisional. Dr. Alexander makes this point in his book.  That is part of what makes his book so compelling. He was shown what he needed to be shown, the rest will come later.  God leaves room for us to decide about these things in order for a real decision of faith to be possible. Other reviewers of this book may need to take this into account<br /><br />Also, his book was written not to describe \\"heaven\\" in detail, an impossible feat as he remarks in the book, but to provoke the scientific community to better discuss the \\"hard problem of consciousness\\".  Some comments in the reviews of the book seem to miss this point. I congratulate him for his willingness to advance the discussion and to share his experience.  A professional person who is greatly respected in his field may finally provoke those in the health care profession and the clergy to finally come to grips with Near Death Experience. This work may contribute to more fully understand ourselves, the nature of our world, and the reality of the Ultimate Mystery of God as best as we are able. After all, God has so many more suprises in store for us!<br />Thank you Dr. Alexander for your inspiring and provocative book!
B000068FXX|5.0|first off, the sound quality of the remastered cd was great. i've enjoyed supertramp scince breakfast in america, in which i expeirienced the album, if you know what i mean. this album has several quality songs on it which i'm glad i added it to my collection never owning a copy before.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After finishing the second book I had to start this one right away.  It is well written and a fast read which made me a little sad when I was finished.  I enjoyed how the author concluded it, don't want to spoil it for anyone.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Easy and very pleasant to read. Based on experience, it connects the dots with situations we face daily in business. It gives you the opportunity to progressively test \\"frame disrupters\\" and build your own \\"strong frames\\". I highly recommend this book if you need to step back and quickly build your strategy towards pitching.

B005LAII12|4.0|Have you ever had a friend who held you back? Someone who encouraged you to blow off your responsibilities and abuse drugs? What if this was a friend who was only alive because you wished him to be? What would you do?<br /><br />  John Benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1985. Then, on Christmas morning, he received a plush teddy bear he called Ted. One night, lying in bed, John wished Ted would come to life. That wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while John was making it. Ted came to life shocking John, his parents, and the world at large. But by 2012, no one cares. John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) is working at a car rental agency and has been dating Lori (played by Mila Kunis) for 4 years. Ted (now voiced by Seth MacFarlane) shares an apartment with Lori and John but makes no contribution to the household expenses, entertains prostitutes in the living room, and rushes into bed with John and Lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and John. Eventually, Lori can't take anymore and tells John that Ted must find a job and a place of his own.<br /><br />  Now, I am not a fan of Family Guy and I've never watched any of MacFarlane's other, less popular series. The most popular shows on Fox all seem to follow the same formula. One or two smart characters surrounded by idiots. In Family Guy, the smart characters would be Brian and Stewie. In The Simpsons, the only smart character I can think of is Lisa. That aside, Ted is a hilarious film. Not particularly intelligent, mind you, but what were you expecting from a movie about a teddy bear brought to life by a wish on a falling star? Shakespeare? I won't say it's perfect; it isn't. I will say it was worth the price. See it.

B0073PPNE8|4.0|I just watched [[ASIN:B0073PPNE8 Cold Mountain]], and it did, as I expected it would, bring a tear to my eye. It's been years since I've been moved to tears like this by a movie.  To avoid spoiling the story, I won't get into details, but it was very well acted, executed, and beautifully produced and directed.<br /><br />And I love and have visited many times, western North Carolina. I really do. Which I'm certain added to my appreciation of Cold Mountain.<br /><br />It is an historical romance.  So if you enjoy them, you will enjoy this one, it's pretty wonderful in that genre.  If you don't, well, maybe you won't.
B00913DPW2|2.0|If you want to use a walk through the whole game,  then this game is for you.  I personally want to figure it out the puzzles myself,  and enjoy a true hint.  This is not like Snark or the other games I have played.  Really disappointed.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This lovely book has  touched my heart in so many places I don‘t know where to begin............take the journey.....you won‘t regret it.
B0018QQQKS|5.0|This is centered on the premise that the need to pay for war throughout history has been the primary driving force on the creation of money and banking systems. It's sort of the financial equivalent of \\"An army marches on its stomach.\\" Ferguson covers the history of paying for the march. Most interesting is the account of USA banking and currency. He describes the failure of the S in attempting a cotton backing system for it's currency. Ferguson points out that civil war greenbacks were worth about 50c at war's end while the Confederate greyback was worth about 1c when the N declined payment on S bonds. It's where our government learned how to inflate away debt, so significant in our time.<br /><br />I think that Ferguson makes a mistake in his analysis of Nathan Rothschild's bond and bullion transactions around the battle of Waterloo. If Nathan anticipated a long war, he was not operating on precedent. Napoleon won a series of short wars. Each time he destroyed an army in battle he ended a war. That is until the next one. Is that what Ferguson means?<br />There's a very good job of describing Nathan's switch into bullish bond purchases and nerve in holding onto an investment. It's interesting that he credits Nathan, more than his father, with the founding of the Rothschild fortune.<br /><br />Ferguson attributes bubbles to easy credit. Financial corruption follows easy money. Corruption of banking and loan agencies certainly exacerbated the recent downturn, but it wasn't the cause as so many liberal economists contend. In considering bubbles on a mathematical basis, he is somewhat ambivalent between \\"fat tails\\" and non-statistical events.  That's especially true in the section describing the LTCM failure in 1998. Both ideas are advanced, with the text not in agreement with the Afterword.<br /><br />Hedge funds are analyzed with emphasis on the development of LTCM by quants Merton, Scholes and Meriwether. There is a partial presentation of the Black-Scholes equations for option evaluation without either derivation or application. In citing the causes of the LTCM debacle, there appears to be some confusion between use of B-S for option pricing versus evaluation of probabilistic odds. LTCM continued operations for a while after the bailout and it's model is being successfully used in subsequent hedging entities. The LTCM business model appears to work successfully most of the time, with one spectacular crash. The financial analysis is incomplete. If Soros offered $500 million on condition of another $500 million, why did the eventual arranged bailout total $3.6 billion?<br /><br />The chapter detailing development of the insurance industry is particularly interesting and informative. This section is worth the price of the book, or at least the effort to read it. Starting with the origins of insurance in Scotland, Ferguson traces development and theory with social consequences up to the present time. Failure of government insurance legislation and subsidy is illustrated with aspects of financial derivatives and the litigation surrounding losses from The New Orleans Hurricane Katrina. He does a good job of relating financial derivatives to the insurance industry.<br /><br />International finance has a good chapter, starting with development of the China trade in the 19th century. The modern section features the career of George Soros, with a sparse introduction to his philosophy of reflexivity.<br /><br />This is a very interesting and informative history of money in all it's forms, but the sections purporting to analyze risk are very incomplete.

B000002JSN|3.0|Physical Graffiti has some great tunes it would have made a stellar single album. There is some filler however the more listen to Down By The Seaside the more i like it.

B0068ZZ6CI|4.0|A good sampling of their music. Fans that already own their cds aren't missing much with the regular version but this special version has some nice remixe's. I'm especially fond of the Scooter remix and the Feuer Frei one. I feel like they missed a few of there better songs as well but that's my personal opinion.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first book is definitely the best, but the story goes on.  I had to see what else happened, if for no other reason to see who survived the love triangle (I can be that shallow ;) The action was no where near as intense, but that's to be expected since the games are over.  The story moves so quickly though, and things I'd normally see coming from miles away hit me like a brick wall. Maybe because it was a continuation of the story, but I found it almost as riveting as the first book!<br />After the first book I expected Katniss to remain tough and invincible. But I was reminded she's a 17 year old forced to grow up too fast because of the cruelty of cowardly, selfish people. I had to remind myself I wouldn't, actually couldn't, have reacted with half the maturity or mental strength that she did.<br />Just like the first, I don't recommend this book for younger children.  Older ones may read and begin to understand the unjustness of the described society.  It might be too much to hope that kids will be more grateful for their freedoms after reading this book, but who knows?

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was incredibly hesitant to read this book after hearing it was about children killing each other.  However, EVERYONE who told me they read it said I would love it, so I eventually gave in.<br /><br />The story is so engaging and the picture painted so detailed, that you almost forget children have to kill each other.  The society described is basically nothing anyone would want to live in (oppressed poverty) and is ruled by a caricature of a corrupt government and indulged existence.  The citizens of every district but the ruling one have to choose one child to send to this survival event, held every year to remind them of \\"the dark days\\" when humans almost destroyed themselves. It is a fight to the death, leaving only one survivor.<br /><br />Still, I see why the book is so popular.  I was hooked so hard and fast that I read the entire series in a week.  It's very well written.  The scenery was so detailed (without being boring) that I felt like I could be dropped in the middle of District 12 and find my way straight to every location mentioned. The characters are detailed and likeable, or dis-likeable if that's their  purpose.  The author also manages to keep up so much mystery in their personalities so there are twists and turns in their fight for survival. Thankfully, the actual killing scenes are brief.  So brief in fact, that you almost gloss over them.  I couldn't wait to get to what happened next so I am ashamed to say I barely acknowledged them unless they made me cry.<br /><br />Parents in doubt, I'm telling you it's a brutal, disgusting story.  I have no idea how this became a children's book!  I certainly wouldn't want any child of mine reading it before they were... 14?  At least old enough to discuss the issues presented in the story. Trust me, there are plenty. I wish I could better explain the positives, which are mainly in the overall writing and description of the character's journey. It's a story focused on survival, not death. The reassurancesI received from my friends were all spot on, and I certainly do not regret reading the book.  However, I encourage you read it before you let your child read it.  Borrow it from the Kindle library if you can!

I have waited in line for hours, enjoyed every hour of reading and rereading Ms. Rowling's prior series, but this was disapointing as her first adult selection offering. I so look forward to her characters vividly coming to life but this one didn't do that for me. I will admit I didn't finish the book, and that almost never happens. Wish I had read a sample.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|She has a nice mix of arrangements, allowing each song to stand on its own. While she's one of a great number of wonderful female '1-man bands', she has a distinctive sound that is the equal of any of them.

B0091XIZO0|4.0|As he turns thirty, Lang Lang continues to create divisive reactions. His worldwide celebrity status makes him critic-proof, a fact that brings out even harsher opinions. contrary to the worst detractors, he isn't a fake; in concert the technique is spectacular, and he has a flair that throws the music over the footlights. The crowds adore him personally and always will, I imagine.<br /><br />On records the story is different. As this Chopin recital shows, Lang Lang's playing can be blunt and without nuance. compared to the freshness and delicacy that was evident when he first appeared, the pianist has followed Kissin in becoming somewhat hardened and impersonal in his interpretations. the opening work is the second set of Etudes Op. 25, and where I admired the flash and dazzle of Lang Lang's recent Liszt album, his focus on extrovert display in Chopin plays to the gallery, reaching for big effects without delicacy or much personal feeling. Tender, reflective Etudes like the C-sharp Minor (no. 7) afford a lovely respite. Lang Lang has a poetic side, which I find is most convincing attribute as an interpreter. The famous, spectacular \\"Winter Winds\\" Etude (no. 11) begins with finesse before it virtually explodes and the roof caves in. It's a crude reading, even though one admires the ease with which the right and left hand parts are voiced without fudging the difficulties.<br /><br />The two Nocturnes that come next appeal to the pianist's lyrical side, but in Op. 55 no. 2 the phrasing is impersonal and a tad proficient. Lang Lang has such a precise touch that he can create air in between very fast passing notes, which is a marvel when Liszt write up a firestorm. The same quality gives a nice open clarity in Chopin, but legato passages sometimes feel disjointed - I'm not naming a serious flaw, only noting that the singing line isn't always brought out enough. The second Nocturne here (Op. 15 no. 1) is the most successful item so far; it's quietly reflective and touching, with restrained passion in the contrasting middle section.<br /><br />Lang Lang mentions that the popular Grande Valse Brillante (Op. 18 no. 1) was among the earliest Chopin that he learned. He splits the difference between the elegance of Lipatti and the boisterous exuberance of Kissin. the result is perhaps too much of a hybrid to sound distinctive on its own, but the reading holds it own, certainly. You feel that a musical imagination is expressing itself, if somewhat cautiously. The Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise, which is so rhapsodic that it can fall apart, wasn't a work that I expected Lang Lang to excel at, but it turns out to be very impressive. His touch and phrasing are lovely, and real personality comes through.<br /><br />Just as engaging are the two numbers that end the recital, the Nocturne Op. Post. in C-shapr Minor and the \\"Minute Waltz\\" (not played for speed - Lang Lang takes 2 min.) If only the rest of the recital had risen to this level, revealing what he is capable of. Like his other albums, this one won't earn unreserved praise, but the best parts won me over. The recorded sound and the piano itself are fine.<br /><br />(There's a bonus pop crossover song that I will leave as a surprise, as well as a 14 min. DVD about Lang Lang's love of Chopin, which wasn't part of my download.)<br />Why no voting buttons?

0618526412|1.0|\\"When one puts [this book] down, it is with . . . a feeling of having been nourished by the truth.\\" When I put this book down, I just kept asking myself what made me pick it up to begin with.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I enjoyed the HP series from Ms Rowling and was looking forward to reading a grown-up novel from this author.  I have had the book for approx 1 week and normally would have had a book of this size read in just a few days.  I am only half way through \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" and not all that impressed.  I found the first several chapters to be confusing, garbled if you will.  It's as if a high school student desperate to impress thier English instructor, sat own with a thesaurus and used as many alternate words as possible.  It was rather unpleasant.  I do like the story line and it has gotten a bit better but I still find it just a bit difficult to follow.  Too many characters.  Perhaps it was the garbage I had to sort through in the beginning that just makes it less than joyful to read.  I don't know...maybe her niche is in writing for teens/pre-teens.  I will finish the book, eventually.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. I have read the book and this movie misses allot of key things that happened in the book. Don't get me wrong this would be a good movie if you have not or never will read this book but if you have just avoid this one.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it's alright but can't there be a calculator that does 6th grade division D-:!?! I mean really that just makes H.W. cheating harder D-:!!!

B009331ENC|5.0|This entire series is very frightening!! The writers make you really think about how fragile our secret services agencies seem to be. But in real life this would never happen.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Just good, good music, 1st song to last.  Good music, and important music, too.  It's been a long time since I put an album on and didn't realize I'd listened to it a couple times through before I came to.  Buy it for yourself, then buy it for somebody else.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|As the author of [...]I've got some experience in building on mythology and history and Gaiman nailed this one! Great characters, great story, by far the best book he's written, and I've read them all. One of my all time favorite books!

B0058VW36U|5.0|Okay- so I am a late arrival on the android game scene- but this game is just plain cute- his noises of joy and dissapointment just make you smile. The variety of levels and the games with in are numerous enough to keep you engaged for a very long time. Great to kill time in the car while waiting for the draw-bridge!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Being the author of [...], I've read a lot of zombie and demon stories and this is the best one I've read by far. Brooks writes about a zombie apocalypse but does it from a non fiction stand point consisting of a reporter speaking with survivors of the plague from all over the world about ten years after the war is over. Great writing done with a global view of a world catastrophe. On a side note, I bought the zombie survival guide after this and didn't like it anywhere near as much as WWZ.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I first heard Passenger's 'Let Her Go' on Sirius Radio while slinging coffee at work. It took me awhile to notice the song and like it... but I really enjoy it. It was nice to find it free on Amazon along with other free gems I've stumbled across on here (The Veils come to mind..) I think though if you are buying 'All the Little Lights\\" and you have nice headphones, a good system or you have a picky ear you should stick with a CD and rip it at 320 kbps yourself. I notice a lot of clipping on this particular album, but it does include a few more tracks than the American cd pressing. You can (as noted by another reviewer) buy the import and get all the tracks.  I've been happy with most of Amazon's mp3 albums but this one has too much compression applied or something and it just doesn't sound like it should. I'd never take away a star because of the quality of sound this album deserves my rating even on an 8 track.
B0086700CM|5.0|considering they are my second cousins that created imangi studios I have to give them a big five stars now I realize its just running jumping and sliding but still is very fun and addictive
B005K17RU0|4.0|Downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire. Works well - I have not run into any trouble with it. I can access information more quickly and much easier than opening the web browser and going to weather websites. Convenience and the satellite view is a big plus.

0425263916|3.0|This is the second novel of in the Crossfire Trilogy.  These first two books have spent weeks in the Top 10 books sold on Amazon. This trilogy, as well as the erotic romance genre, has become extremely popular.  The third book, ENTWINED WITH YOU, is scheduled for release on May 7, 2013.<br /><br />REFLECTED IN YOU picks up rights where the first one left off.  Gideon and Eva are still early in their relationship and continue to spend their days and nights wrapped up in each other's lives.  But, in this novel, the past continues to be more of a problem for their relationship.  There is still a lot of passion and hot love scenes, but this time, jealousy, anger, and control raise their ugly heads.  Eva's best friend, Cary, also makes more of a presence in this story.  His life quickly becomes entangled with Gideon and Eva's and the results are life changing.  Other characters are more involved as well, including Eva's father and mother.<br /><br />I have to admit, that I began to get frustrated while reading this one.  Each chapter seemed to have the same pattern of sex, fight, get jealous, fight, have more sex, etc, etc.  I continued to get frustrated with Gideon and his manipulations and with Eva and her immaturity.  But, as I read on...the pieces started falling into place and suddenly the whole story made sense.  Did I feel it drug out a little too long? Yes.  But, the last several chapters really grabbed my attention.<br /><br />Again, this is a fantasy type of story.  The jealousy, anger, and infatuation we can relate to, but the private planes, homes, private drivers, and New York City life, maybe not.  That is what makes these stories so likable.  We can escape into the emotions, the sexual chemistry, and the fancy lifestyle of these characters and maybe even realize our lives aren't so dull after all.<br /><br />Sadly, I will now have to wait a long 6 1/2 months for the conclusion to Gideon and Eva's story.  Luckily, I have plenty to read until then.
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Fun Movie for whe whole family, a classic turned into a modern fun time. Not a Shrek but definitely worth a watch.
098478280X|2.0|EDIT Nov 6, 2012: To those who felt my original review is an overreaction, I went back to the book to try a few algorithms AGAIN to hopefully be inspired and benefitted by the book.<br /><br />All I want is the truth about what does/doesn't benefit the software community collectively.<br /><br />To review my stance: this book is AWESOME, but it's worshipped like crazy by famished and job-hungry programmers. But also, it teaches bad habits, which is what triggers my need-to-troll a bit. Just enough to balance these perspectives out. One example of a bad habit is, the book uses Java but doesn't use Java naming conventions, i.e. most variables have meaningless names that aren't obvious at a glance. Doctors get to scribble on a pad, but applying the same attitude to code will make the next person in charge of your work, well, become the next incredibly frustrated hulk. Pads end up in the trash. Your code is expected to survive the apocalypse.<br /><br />On page 97, there's a solution to the problem of \\"Erase all recurring characters in a string without creating a second string.\\"<br />Copied the code there into my IDE, made sure it was verbatim, and it DOES NOT do what it says at all.<br />Reading through the code, even to my mind, the approach made little sense. So I started coding my own--it worked and was simple (and I'm pretty slow at algorithms in general). So what is the point of finding that flaw?<br /><br />Simple. Algorithms are an internal art of the logical mind tempered by a reasonable drive. The BEST don't challenge people at a whiteboard. We have computers now, didn't you know? The BEST aren't putting their faces in a Q and A book, filling their brain RAM with trivia.<br /><br />When Einstein was asked to recite his home phone number, he looked it up in a phonebook, because memorization is a vain way to go long-term. If you believe in keeping all your data in the front of your brain (RAM) instead of storing it to disk for later, you'll have a rough time figuring out why your server crashes every time someone uploads a 20mb file. Jackie Chan in Forbidden Kingdom: \\"your cup is already full.\\"<br /><br />It teaches non-holistic ways. Which is fine for a regular job. But applying to the top companies by memorizing 'X out of 150' algorithms...I guess that style is fine for the Microsoft side of things. But it's the reason why companies HAVE to be so strict now. Too many zombies/duds applying.<br /><br />It took 20 years and a team to create a viable formulation for Quicksort. Experts who try to optimize it almost always make it worse. As a Java developer I lay my trust in true subject matter experts who work together to create solid tools we can all reuse. What a waste of life time to reinvent low level code for any reason other than research and practice. I never thought I'd see a cult following in the software industry but here it is. Want to see a book with GREAT interview questions? Java/J2EE Job Interview Companion by Arulkumaran K. Thank me later.<br /><br />Algorithms are opinions. It's 'how I see the problem and the solutions that happen to come to mind'. They are snowflakes. So be a snowflake, like algorithms. Then you'll understand more and faster. Don't be another sweatshop coder if you're aiming for a fulfilling lifestyle.<br /><br />Visit careercup.com and you'll see the primary audience there. :/<br /><br />============== ===Original=======================<br /><br />I've had this book for awhile, and was first enamored with its promises. But the entire book and Gayle's career has a pompous side to it, that shows 'need of approval' and staying 'in' with the boys at the top. That's fine for those who've cruised the Ivy League wagon all the way but not helpful for people who need to meet real market needs, like building enterprises and leading best practices.<br /><br />Books like this only help you memorize, keep your head filled with answers, and no mental energy left to ponder the evolution of technology itself. I personally spend day and night, minus sleep, investigating \\"the best and greatest\\" in software land (because there's enough people in the world who naturally enjoy learning data algorithms already); but what I find here is an author who has a short-lived career in practical product development, and more of a theoretical counselor helping you to jump hoops. This life coach helps you give in to a dying legacy system instead of finding your own way, unique strengths, and opinions that challenge the guys at the top. If we all sat around and studied the same 100 algorithms, we'd be a society that knows 100 algorithms collectively. Let people specialize and shine so we can have more progress. This stale fashion of revering tradition is labeled \\"groupthink\\", something a serious HR should know about. You want to be another sweatshop coder? Or someone who can't be replaced, easily?<br /><br />Notice that the author mentions this 5 star book and that she is \\"founder and CEO of CareerCup.com\\" everywhere, but at the end of the day, it's just a book and a website. And a whole lot of theory about the social workings of big companies in their 15 years of fame. If data algorithms be your passion, read something written by a true artist and practitioner of code, not an honorary HR/whiteboard scribbler. Here's a sample of a gem you'll get from this book:<br /><br />\\"Proofreading: Some companies will throw out your resume just because of a typo Please<br />get at least one native English speaker to proofread your resume.\\" ... how intuitive.<br /><br />The saying \\"There are those who can do and those who can teach\\" comes to mind here. Gayle honestly reminds me of myself when I'm in a desperate mode, being apologetic to employers, and basically having to act less than human to get a shot. I went another way--found out what companies REALLY want and can't find much of, then became that. As much as they'd like to tell you, you can't pick up api knowledge overnight and start winning,after 6 years of just toying with sorting char arrays. By the time you become \\"the perfect student\\" you'll find in front of yourself a world that demands more realistic skills, the kind that has only come into existence recently. And guess what? Everyone's grandmother will know how to bubble sort by the time you finish this book. But only a fraction of developers in the world will know how to throw a cloud in the air and make it stretch and dance like big businesses want and need.<br /><br />Life skills: they don't teach you that in school.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Great animation from the the people who do the best effects. The blu ray is stunning. The story is engaging and nuanced. Vendor is great.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good story, well told. This is the first book by this author that I have read, and I enjoyed it!I was looking for something to fill-in my Fifty Shades with-drawal:)unfortunately it did't quite fill it. I loved the relationship between Christian/Ana. Gideon is not as charming as Christian Grey (I loved Christian) I like Gideon I wish he had been a more dominate/controlling and not quite so angry. Story moved as a good pace, kept me interested. I will definately read other books by this author. I look forward to the third book in the Crossfire series.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was pretty great.. Very fast paste going from one thing to another. But I love the intensity of the love Eva and Gideon share for one another. It will keep you on edge the whole book!
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I have read every book written by Jo Nesbo and translated into English, including the Harry Hole novel, 'The Redeemer,' which is, for some reason, less available that the others. For me, 'The Phantom' is less interesting than its predecssors. There has been a cleverness that is akin to Michael Connelly, the sense that the reader can never be certain of the outcomes and causes of outcomes until the last page; this quality is not evident for me in 'The Phantom.'
B002VECM6S|5.0|I just can't get enough. Wonderful movie. There hasn't been a good one like this in awhile. I.m glad I bought it.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|Ok we thought it started off very slow. We of an audience of two here...almost gave up within the first half hour. But once it finally pulled itself forward it gained some momentum. Once it started to cause you to smile or laugh and so humorous the Depp bouncing on top of the side kick's lap all the way down the back steps their pathetic car bounced. If you cut it out and showed it as a short take it would be famous. And then there was that feeling that you had seen some of these characters not long before. The tall skinny one bad eye dude, the high pitched cackle of the black witch, the sidekick and even the menacing roommate that brought rum filters to make some sort of odd high octane booze. Hadn't we just seen these people in Pirates? I feel too many people tried to make this film too serious. Once it took off we lost ourselves and went with it and it was pure fun. And whew as we waited for that other shoe to fall...it never really did. I mean we never saw the super ugly happen and there were all sorts of possible uglies. I was afraid half a dozen people might be killed but didn't happen. So except for nod to tragic there was the cock fights but even they were tempered down a bit so most squirmish like myself could get through. But the suspense it might be otherwise also kept you in suspense. I was glad the ride was over but we both enjoyed this movie ride. Will watch it again as a re-run sometime too. I haven't read the writers books it's based on but will be interested in at least his written version of this one. Half the time if you've read the book you hate the movie. I'm right there and I see a lot of people's negative or neutral reviews here are in that category.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As always i can't put it down .Thanks for another great book...keep up the good work always enjoy her books._
B007TK77QE|1.0|Well I've had this book for a couple of weeks now and I still can't get into it. I keep trying to pick up from where I left off but I've skipped so many pages the story has slipped away too.Maybe I'll try it again one day!
B008RV5K4U|5.0|If you loved the comic book, don't hesitate, you'll love this movie. The adaptation is faithful and impressive. I was blown away at how natural the story was and how well it played out. The art was great, the fights were iconic, the voices were spot on and the story made even more sense.<br /><br />If you haven't read the comic book, read it. It's one of the best.<br /><br />*If you are thinking of buying this for your little children, just know that this is not a cheesy tv-friendly Batman story. There is more swearing and violence than you may be expecting (breaking bones, killing, etc) Just be informed.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I purchased this for my 99 year old aunt. She has lost about 80% of hearing. She can't use the usual hearing aids. Her face lit up when I put them on her. She can now HEAR when we are talking to her. Very easy to use, she can place it on herself-the volume can be turned low to high. GREAT PRODUCT!!
B004X80QNG|5.0|I've had Pocket Informant before on a different platform.  It gave me everything I need then, and gives me what I need now.  I can't think of anything it doesn't do, except it would be nice if it had its own widget but I took care of that with Simple Calendar widget so problem solved.
B0025KW29U|5.0|With nearly 600 5-star reviews, this doesn't really need my support. But when a movie changes you the way this one changed me, you feel inclined to do your part. WATCH THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it!
0811870413|5.0|For over 15 years I have been making bread, buying and trying new books and methods-  all in pursuit of that \\"artisan, rustic\\" loaf.  I wanted what I had eaten in Europe and in high end bakeries in the States. Many methods have given good results and some have been very good.  This book is the one that took it over to where I have always wanted to be.  I was ELATED with the results I got.  It does take a few days to get the starter going, but its so easy.  Much easier and less wasteful than many other starters. I have made this with and without the cast iron pot.  It works well on baking tiles even when the bread is not covered.  True, it doesn't rise AS much as when its covered, but its still a large, open chewy crumb, crackling crust bread that will WOW all who eat it.  The starter, when stored in the fridge and then refreshed before using, does get a little more tangy than when made the first time, but its still great.  ONE BIG BONUS--- the method of using a wet dough, not mixing much and doing the lifting and folding in the rising stage--can be applied to other bread doughs!  I have done this with some other doughs (without this particular starter) and made them slightly wetter-- the gluten develops wonderfully and baking on tiles in the oven gives the 'spring' we bakers look for.  THANKS, Chad!-- this is a great method with amazing end results. ( The other book I'd recommend that gives amazing results is Jim Lahey's - MY BREAD )
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child scores a big hit with A Wanted Man.  The story line is not predictable and it takes many twists and turns throughout the book.  It is one of those books which is hard to put down.  I finished the entire book in two days.  I was so pleased with the book I will probably read it a second time to gather more details.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album has great variety. It is quirky and emotional and you can easily lose yourself in this sound. I'll recommend Alt-J to anyone.
B0086700CM|4.0|at first I started playing it on my friends IPOD and then I got my kindle and got it.  BTW  ITS KINDA CHALLENGING
B0038KSEVQ|2.0|Just couldn't really get into this movie. It was slow and I found myself pretty bored. The effects were not very impressive and they seemed to want to just rely on the effects and gore more than the lame story. Lots of gross out moments, few actual scares.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|This is an excellent album. Has a great variety with different sounding songs. Musically very talented band.  I would definitely recommend it.
B000E9910W|5.0|I love this item and it came to me fast in the mail. I really enjoy it and works great with no problem at all.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Open network sockets?!  On a calculator?! Keep dreaming. Uninstalled.  Extra words, extra words, extra words, extra words, extra words,  extra words.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|more money?? screw you, i will never buy another alawar game. what a complete rip off! do not purchase!! you can't finish what you paid for!
B00631VJIC|5.0|I love the series so wanted to get the cd. it came fast in the mail, the cd plays great and no scratches at all and the case looks great.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it can not stop playing it wish I could play all day lol. I do not know if its monkeys or birds chasing me but it is a fun game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome Game but a quick word of advice SAVE ALL YOUR PRIZES to get the bonuses exspecilay the whistles to get the prizes that fall off the edges I'm now level 165 and have 3028 coins and unlimited coin regenerion in game and all prizes and puzzels once you hit level 100 its like the game never ends I never went below 100 coins bonuses don't go past 9x so if you go past that then its ok to sell the prize and don't waste them to and always fully charge up you shake bonus to get the most out of it so download and have fun also this is great to burn time when your wait due to coin regenerion rate in early in your leveling
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I love this item and it came to me fast in the mail. I really enjoy it and works great with no problem at all.
B006CHML4I|4.0|- i used to wear my watches 24/7.<br />- it has a distinctive color (not vivid badly)<br />- this one really suits me; it is very light (sometimes i doubt i'm wearing it), it is silent when i put it near my head while sleeping, luminated hands.<br /><br />- the only con, it is little more sporty and for younger ppl (i'm 35), so in work it only fits when my whole style is casual and liberated.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was a very good story in my opinion! I liked the character development and the flaws each character has. I find the characters and how they are interwoven better than in Fifty Shades. Anastasia had friends but i didn't really care about them like I do Eva's.
B0063GORYU|5.0|like this game, even though it is hard to win - stay at it and you will finally win. This will test you and the more you play the more you will like this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it.  I'm now reading Mockingjay.  Hope it's as good.  It is so far. I only wish there were more books in the series.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Am quite used to English speak, but this one was a jumble of mumbles and very hard to understand - turned if off after about twenty minutes-will try again if they come out with a clearer version
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in you is an easy read, it's fun for when you just have a few minutes and want to get lost in a book. Enjoying it so far.
B0083IUF6K|4.0|until he matures and has REAL experiences to write/sing about, he's goanna be something special! If... he surrounds himself with the right people. Overall pretty good first release. And the style is similar to late 50's and early 60's rock and folk. Its \\"retro\\" but hopefully hell come more into his on as he ages...he's  only 19!

0316228532|5.0|Within the first chapters, the reader knows that Rowling spent a great deal of time developing the characters. What makes the book good is that the characters are believable. The book centers around the death of a small town councilman. Anyone acquainted with small town life and idiosyncrasies, will appreciate and relate to the characters of \\"The Casual Vacancy\\". If however, you are looking for anything like the Harry Potter series, keep looking. Rowling has demonstrated her gifts as a diversified writer in writing this wonderful and insightful novel.<br /><br />Any number of reviews will tell you the issues that are tackled in \\"The Casual Vacancy\\". It was fascinating because it was not written from the perspective of one side of the tracks or the other. Its characters were beautifully believable; human and flawed with prejudices.<br /><br />It showed, like Rowling's other works, the human potential for good and evil. The triumph or defeat of the human spirit in association with the other overarching theme, death. Like the Potter series, in \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" centers upon the reality of death, and the characters' reaction to death. And, to a lesser extent than the Potter series, the potential for resurrection in the individual life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An enjoyable, quick read.  None of the characters are particularly endearing but they're not meant to be.  It was one of those books I really wanted to see to the end.
0425263908|2.0|I just finished 50 Shades of Grey trilogy a few weeks ago and was looking for a book similar to it and found Bared to You.  The reviews stated it was way better than 50 shades, so I had really high hopes.  Honestly, I don't think it compares at all.  My sister-in-law, who also read 50 shades, did not like the book either.  I feel like it didn't have any \\"meat\\" to it at all.  I feel like pieces of information/details were left out and right when some drama started to unfold, it barely got into it, and then the book ended!!  It didn't capture my attention like 50 shades - in fact, I had to convince myself to read it at times.

0143105035|5.0|Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.<br /><br />But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.<br /><br />During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.<br /><br />But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.<br /><br />But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.<br /><br />Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.<br /><br />The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow.the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work.

0307730697|5.0|Bought this book based upon a friend recommending it for my son, who is going into the military.  I read it in three days, my teenage daughter read it in two days and I haven't seen it since because everyone wants to read it!  It is not a story about the Navy Seals.  It is about Adam, the person.  Who he was, how he lost his way after graduating high school, the love of his life supporting him as he found his way again serving our country and the brotherhood/sisterhood of life in the military and military spouses.  I highly recommend this book.
B0093LE30U|4.0|One of the big arcs of the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.<br /><br />It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually), known as \\"Stargate: Atlantis.\\" The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.<br /><br />At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.<br /><br />So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking \\"shadow,\\" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.<br /><br />\\"Stargate: Atlantis\\" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of \\"Stargate SG-1,\\" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.<br /><br />It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that \\"SG-1\\" had in ITS first season -- a few duds (\\"The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you\\"), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.<br /><br />And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.<br /><br />And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (\\"This device must be using an older version of Windows\\"), and Sheppard (\\"I am your death. That is all you need to know.\\" \\"I prefer 'Steve'\\"). But there's humor from everyone (\\"Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!\\").<br /><br />The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.<br /><br />\\"Stargate Atlantis\\" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.lves nicely at the end of the season.<br /><br />\\"Stargate Atlantis\\" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles.

1455519006|5.0|I am never unhappy with the decision to read a book by Mr. Baldacci. This one is a real \\"Feeler\\" as he has a young girl more or less as a partner. She comes from a very bad enviorment but has super intellect. The story  runs through their exploits which are not only interesting but exciting in the pursuit to find who tried to kill them both at the beginning of the novel. In the last fifty pages we see a plot appear that no one would have imagined. I have kept this review more to the far edge than to get \\"heavy\\" in description and ruin your reading of the novel. One thing I will adamantly state though is be sure to obtain the Novel and enjoy it. It's great.
1452101248|5.0|The first time I used this cookbook, I picked two things from it to make for my boyfriend and myself. He's a meat-eater with no interest in my vegetarianism, so I was unsure about his reaction to the food. First, he ate the entree on the cover of the book (the eggplant) and loved it. He enthusiastically told me it's the best thing he's ever eaten! Then we got to the second item from the book, stuffed onions. THEN he told me THAT was the best thing he's ever eaten!<br /><br />This book truly is full of wonderful, delicious recipes. It's the first cookbook I've found where I get a meatless selection, but the recipes are good enough for him to forget he's not eating meat. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Donald Fagen does not know how to write a bad tune.  Even what he considers his worst is better than most artists' best.  That's not to imply that Morph The Cat is his worst.  There is no such thing because matter what, Donald is a multi-gifted cat who does everything at a high level.  He always has a way to reel you in.  If the music doesn't automatically grab you, the narrative, lyrics, solos, instrumentation, arrangements or Donald's fantastic vocal performances has a way of prying its way into your soul--at least in my experience. My initial disappointment with Morph stemmed from my trying to impose my musical ideals on Donald.  I wanted his music to sound the way I thought it should--something that's at the heart of most every criticism about the record. After getting over myself, I found Morph to be another Fagen Masterpiece that is still revealing its nuances to me. Point is, don't tell DF how his music should sound.  Just listen and enjoy.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|So... I am and have been a Taylor fan for a while now... so, like all others, was super excited for this album to come out. I got the Target edition (bonus disc woohoo!) the day it came out. And I think it's absolutely fantastic. The thing that I really appreciate about this album is that there is quite a bit of diversity in terms of her sound. She took a risk and worked with some new sounds with these songs, while also remaining true to the sound she's developed. There are tracks that make you want to get up and dance, smile, cry, and whatever else you do when you listen to music.<br />I have to admit that there are a few songs that don't quite hit the high mark for me, either because I think some of her songwriting abilities have fallen a little flat (22 is one. It's cute and dancy, but definitely not her best.) or it sounds a little repetitive (there are a few songs on this album that have tunes similar to those found on Speak Now or before.). Though there are those songs, the songs that DO hit the high mark definitely hit it.<br />In terms of other editions, I would DEFINITELY recommend getting the Target edition, as it comes with a bonus disc that has six extra songs. The unreleased tracks on this disc are really, really good (I honestly think that they could potentially replace some of the songs on the normal album). The demos are fun to listen to and see the differences, though they are semi-limited. The song that I think this really is worth getting for, though, is the acoustic version of 'State of Grace'. I honestly was not expecting much from this track, as the \\"acoustic\\" tracks on the Target version of Speak Now were pretty badly done (they stripped out some of the instruments to make it softer). However, for this song, they completely re-recorded the track, and the softer vocals and guitar definitely fit the song beautifully.<br />Overall, there are a few songs that aren't perfect, but it's hard to find an album that has songs that are perfect. This album is definitely a high point for Taylor and surely my favorite album from her so far. I recommend it highly! Enjoy! <3 RED

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|It took me a while to buy this album, as there was all the buzz about Lana earlier in 2012, but I didn't really pay much attention. However, I saw this item at a good price and decided to buy it (I'd heard a few of the songs and found them decent). But I must admit that this album blew me away.<br />Lana has a very unique musical style and vocal ability, at least for me. She possesses a pretty impressive range, and she can hit the high and low notes really well. It's unique among today's artists, if anything because she actually utilizes her vocal abilities. Her songwriting is both easily understood yet hard to grasp at times. I, for one, find the obscure themes and meditations on life to be really interesting and great to listen to.<br />The music can seem a little repetitive in the beginning, but as you listen to the album more and more, you really get to love the songs and see their uniqueness. OVerall, this album is amazing, and if you are on the fence, I would definitely say go and get it! Love Lana!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Truly entertaining.  Mostly for the more muture audience.  It is a lite way of dealing with life situations of retired adults.<br />A Hollywood ending that all the main characters find their place in life as valuable citizens.<br />The film was well done, not a lot of sex and swearing, something I find a sweet change from American films.<br />There is actually dialogue.  Not just attitude and four letter words because Hollywood can't write dialogue.<br />Highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B005EHQGTS|2.0|I had the free version & didn't use it very much with my Acer 500. Then after reading some of the reviews for the HD version got it as was looking to use the Tab as 2nd monitor. Wasn't too thrilled to paying $9.99 seemed expensive. Well learned after contacting tech support when got stuck in some kind of mode which I can't get it to respond to my fingers that it can't be used as I intended. Still can't use it anyway as it's stuck it something. So it's worthless to me.<br />Web site isn't too helpful. I do no like having to go on & search the forums or incomplete FAQs to solve what my issue is. A big time waster.<br />Then the having to upgrade the streamer version get new set up is not related to the previous version. I also now have both the free & HD version on the Acer rather than just the one.
B008R14YBK|2.0|Mendler's voice is somewhat weak and processed in this CD that may make some die-hard fans of Demi Levato happy (the two sound a lot alike on some of these) but the songs are mostly mediocre and a few have suggestive lyrics. Ready or Not is catchy. And 5:15 is an interesting lyric. But the album is not up to the caliber of previous Disney Channel stars like Miley Cyrus and Hilary Duff. While Mendler is an adult, her audience is made up of children and many of these songs are not catchy enough for the younger pop crowd. From a parent's perspective these are mostly forgettable and it's disappointing that they don't match the youthfulness of her audience.

B008B11R1Q|5.0|Some years back I got The XX on a recommendation from Amazon.  It quickly became one of my favorite albums, to the extent of putting it on random and listening to the 12 songs in loop for 7 hours straight.  When I heard they were splitting up due to personal differences, I was heartbroken.  When I saw the pre-order for the NEW ALBUM (!!) Coexist, I did squee with delight.<br /><br />Coexist did not disappoint.<br /><br />When I first listened, I was dismayed at what could have been an inferior product.  I realized quickly, though, that it was just a matter of not being as familiar with the new songs as I was with the old favorites.  And I was right.  In less than a week, I was appreciating the poignancy of Angels, the insistence of Fiction or the sweetness of Tides.  I have a playlist of the first 2 albums and can happily listen to them all day.<br /><br />Coexist is much more produced than XX was.  It lost some of the raw emotional impact of the first album in the slickness.  Also, the conversational back and forth of the two lead singers is not as prevalent in Coexist, but when they do, the chemistry is still there.  Closing with Our Song, the story of the turmoil of Coexist is brought full circle, where the two singers return to a state of, well, coexistence.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Okay, here's your challange: Search through Amazon and find me a book with over 1600 PERFECT 5 star ratings. (That's how many there were when I bought it.  There's more now!) Trust me, you won't find many. One that is on that short list is Wool by Hugh Howey--and it's there for good reason.  The Wool books are exceptional!  It's the little indie book that could, despite the weird name!<br /><br />Consider . . .<br /><br />Your entire world is a huge underground silo, 148 levels straight down into the earth.  No elevator, only a giant top-to-bottom spiral staircase.  No one even knows what life was like when people actually lived aboveground--those people have been dead for centuries.  Life goes on underground in the silo.<br /><br />Everyone has a job--you might wear white overalls and work in the nurseries where babies are born to parents who've won a lottery to allow them to try for children.  Maybe you wear green and work in the gardens, where you manage the food supply.  Maybe you are assigned to wear the blue of mechanical, and you live in the downdeep--the very bottom. It's your job to keep the lights on, the air breathable, and the pumps running.  Maybe the mysterious red-wearing IT?  What do they do exactly?  No one knows for sure, but part of their job is to develop the suits you must wear if you've committed a crime worthy of the ultimate punishment: CLEANING.<br /><br />In your world, if you should dare to even vocalize that you want to leave the silo, you are immediately obliged--and banished into the toxic and deadly aboveground.  Your last task?  To clean the cameras that broadcast the view outside the silo to the belowground world.  IT swears that this time they've solved the problems, that the suit will provide protection for you to survive . . . that the seals will hold . . . that you won't die a horrible death when the suit fails and the toxic aboveground air floods into your lungs.  After all these years, they still haven't successfully developed a suit that works.  Strangely, there is always just enough time for the cleaning before the suit fails and the criminal dies, collapsed into a miserable pile on the dead grass outside--right in front of the camera--where the body remains eternally, visible to all who remain in the silo below. . .<br /><br />This is the world of Wool, and you should already have a strong suspicion that everything is not exactly as it seems . . . at least, not how THEY want it to seem . . .<br /><br />The writing is outstanding and the characters are rich.  The imagery is vivid and the pace of the action, especially in the last 1/3, is edge of your seat exciting.  Seriously, a few times I had to look up and take some deep breaths to gather myself--I was stressed out!<br /><br />Unfortunately there is some language--mostly from one character.  Looking back, I can see that the language helped to define this character, and as the stress built to the climax and this character's language got more colorful, I could feel him spiraling out of control.  I would have preferred to not have the language, but in this book it wasn't a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />The writing in Wool took me to another place.  I completely enjoyed reading this book.

1612183956|2.0|I usually don't review books and I guess I shouldn't complain as I got this book for \\"free\\" as a Prime member, but I was just so annoyed by it that I just couldn't resist. The book starts with an interesting, if overused, premise of a Secret Service agent lost in an unknown town and suffering from amnesia. It appeared to be a mix of a thriller with an unreliable narrator, I was hooked. But then it just does a 180 and starts throwing every Sci-Fi cliché that the author could think of. It's an incredible jarring change of tone. The parts for two or three interesting novels were there, they were just wasted on a single one

B007FEFLTO|3.0|i did enjoy reading this book but i think it was not as good as the first book in this trilogy & neither of the books is anywhere near as good as his old book, pillars of the earth; i think he is putting less background history in these books, although what he does include is accurate but not enough for my tastes; i will download the third book when it comes out but i expect it to be average but worth reading if first two were any indication
B007MDQW3W|4.0|I've always been a sucker for a good woman's voice and a piano (such as Norah Jones or Fiona Apple), and when I caught a late night appearance of Ms. Spektor one evening last spring (Leno or Fallon), I was hooked.<br /><br />I was vaguely aware of her name, but this is the first album of Regina's I purchased, and I haven't been sorry.  It came out at around the same period of time as Norah Jones and Fiona Apple's released have, so it makes for a nice comparison to have listened to these three albums in rotation over the last 6 months (give or take depending on the album).<br /><br />First off, I find Regina Spektor to be similar to Fiona Apple but I can only say that loosely.  Her piano and vocals seem to show parallels with Fiona's in that she relies on style that is quite melodic and harmonic in that the piano seems to always move even when the vocals aren't.  It makes for a nice dynamic that isn't all that different from a syncopated rhythm in jazz.  The looseness of the comparison comes more from the subject matter of the lyrics and the tone.  Regina Spektor sings in a higher pitch and voice and her lyrics are overall brighter.<br /><br />I love the lyrical content and vocals of this album.  While they occasionally have a dark quality there is a rhythm and melody that is upbeat that can somewhat mask the meaning behind the songs.  It is a quality I've liked and is similar to Norah Jone's last two albums.  It is a quality that keeps me wanting to listen to more and is going to lead me back through Regina's catalog a bit to discover more.  It is also a quality that I liked about Fiona Apple's Extraordinary Machine. At the same time the lyrics and her use of them are quite unique.  Odd vocal phrases and imagery make you think twice on what you hear.  The closest in terms of similarity I could think of is Andrew Bird.<br /><br />Now given all these comparisons and parallels, you may ask yourself why buy this album or give Regina Spektor a try.  Well, all these qualities I hear in her voice really come about as snippets of similarity that just seem to work together in a package that in some ways stands above Norah and Fiona or at the very least with them.  What We Saw From the Cheap Seats has probably been my second most listened to album this year, and it isn't so much because it is a better album that Norah Jones or Fiona Apple's but it is because it does have a style that is different and enjoyable to listen to.  Fiona's album is excellent but quite a chore to listen to.  Norah's is fantastic but a bit dark.  Regina's seems to hit a happy medium.<br /><br />As for those who know Regina's other work or hope to know where this stands with respect to it, I don't know, yet.  My feeling is that some people suggest a couple of her earlier albums over this one.  The one con I find in this album is the production seems to be falling into that over-produced world that many modern albums are falling into.  It isn't enough to stop me from recommending the album, but it has a polish that seems to hold things back just a tad.<br /><br />If you aren't intrigued much, yet, I suggest giving All the Rowboats or Small Town Moon a try. They are two stand out tracks on this album, but any of the other tracks can be a joy to listen to.  As always, I also encourage a sampling via the web.  Regina's work is out there be it live performances or streaming services.  The production and recordings might not be great, but as a manner of trial, you'll get more than you will from the 30 second clips here.ties I hear in her voice really come about as snippets of similarity that just seem to work together in a package that in some ways stands above Norah and Fiona or at the very least with them.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|This is, without a doubt, the biggest disappointment I have ever purchased.  The music is far removed from the style and artisanship the I have come to expect from Ms.Krall.  It may be an attempt to expand into different styles or types of music, but she has failed.  Please listen to the previews before purchasing.  I just wish I could get my money back.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I found that the Amazon disk of Paul McCartney's Kisses on the Bottom was all that I hope for, after seeing his rehearsal and recording session on Ed TV. This album puts one in a mellow mood as it plays while driving to and from the college sessions that I teach. Also the backup musicians are some of the best in the world and they bring their best to this recording. McCartney surprised me that he could handle this kind of material (which I thought only Tony Bennett and a few others could master). In other words, I loved the album.

038572179X|5.0|On a deeply personal level, this is an amazingly beautiful novel.<br /><br />The language and tone are perfect. The characters and settings are painted in vivid detail. And the emotional impact is devastating. I've been a McEwan fan for awhile, but this novel transcends with its overall scope of life and betrayal down to its moments of individual truth found in a simple sentence.<br /><br />This is exactly the type of novel that makes us all wish to be writers.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012.  My how times have changed.  The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music.  If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.<br /><br />Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.<br /><br />Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix.

B006YTTVHO|1.0|Anthropophobia: Fear of people, society.<br /><br />Basically useless, for anyone who is 'social' to any degree. The advice is repetive through subsequent sections, and seems directed toward an audience who has absolutely zero social skills.<br /><br />After I had read the review I believed this would have advice on making/sustaining conversations and small talk. Instead of providing examples of 'how' to think (such as when someone has kids, or an in-common hobby), i was told to be confident and dress comfortably. i would much prefer advice on the odd-silence moments and how to best recover from the pause in conversations (such as asking the person if they are thirsty, or about an 'interesting' watch, or jacket, where your level of knowledge doesnt matter and most probably the person will be more than happy to talk about it).<br /><br />The one positive note is the book didnt mention talking about the weather (unless imbedded within a conversation, not to fill the silence).<br /><br />If this book wasnt free, i would have tried for a refund.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have long enjoyed playing Mahjong on my PC so I looked for it once I bought a smart phone. This is the best version I have found. Many of the other games that I have tried have boards with such small tiles that it is difficult to differentiate the patterns. Other games may have larger tiles but the graphics make it hard to determine which tiles are eligible to be played. I also enjoy competing against my previous attempts either by the number of stars I earn or the time required to complete a round.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|I did not go see this movie anticipating a riveting story and if you're offended at the fact that the story is uninspired or poorly acted then I really think you missed the point of the movie.  The actors, director and producers knew what they were doing when they made Magic Mike.  It's a movie for us ladies to drool over, and we went in DROVES to see it.  Although I realize Channing Tatum is probably never going to be an Oscar winning actor, his acting isn't offensive and he is definitely nice to look at.  I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised that there even WAS a storyline.  Matthew McConaughey is a great sleazeball and the rest of the guys in the cast did exactly what was expected of them.  Look good and dance.  My only complaint is the lead actress.  I wish she would have changed expressions at least once or twice.  Who really cares, though.  I didn't go to see her so it really didn't matter.  OH!  I do love Olivia Munn in this movie.  I wish she had been the lead actress to be quite honest.  2 stars for acting; 8 stars for butts and bods.  That averages to a 5 star movie baby!
1452657661|3.0|3 1/2 stars - I'm reviewing the unabridged audiobook.<br /><br />Imagine doing something criminally dumb as an impetuous twenty-something, getting away with it and having it come back to haunt you just when you've got it all together? That's what happened to Piper Kerman.<br /><br />Piper was a young, adventurous college graduate who fell into a lesbian affair with a slightly older woman who was making her money in the drug trade. Piper quickly realized she was in over her head after Nora asks her to do a job. She does it but breaks it off with Nora soon after. Several years later she has fallen deeply in love with a great guy named Larry and has a respectable job. And that's when the FBI come knocking.<br /><br />The title, Orange is the New Black, makes it sound like some sort of chick lit novel which it isn't. This is Piper's firsthand account of her relatively short (a little over a year) stay in a minimum security prison. It was nothing at all what I was expecting when I picked up this audio. Basically it is clean (with some F-bombs thrown in) and trauma-free; there one almost scuffle and a little pee-pee episode but that's about as graphic as it gets. Clearly I've watched too many scared straight documentaries and sleazy horror films because I was expecting something much rougher. She mentions a few things that were slightly disturbing but they always happen around her, never directly to her. Maybe she was just lucky or maybe she blocked out the ugly stuff? I'll never know but do have to wonder. Though Piper's freedom is gone, she never seems in real danger and is almost always surrounded by friendly, nice people who help each other out. The food and surroundings are less than ideal but she gets in killer shape, reads books, has loads of visitors and learns some handyman skills. Not too shabby, if it's all true.<br /><br />There are a lot of people that come in and out of Piper's life during her stay and I would've liked to get to know at least a few of them on a deeper level (especially Delicious) but instead Piper focuses more on the details and drudgery of her day to day life inside the prison and her minor epiphanies and thoughts. But what the hell, it is her book.  It wasn't boring; don't get me wrong, it just could have been so much better. I never felt an emotional connection to Piper or the many women in the story which is a shame. She mentions time and again how easy she has it on the outside compared to these women (and she does) and I had to wonder how she was able to fit in so seamlessly. Almost everyone seemed to like her and it didn't seem realistic that she wouldn't have more of a struggle considering the culture/personality clash.<br /><br />I did like the fact that Piper wasn't a \\"poor me\\" type. If she had been this book would've been a DNF early on. But she knows she screwed up and that it's no one's fault but her own. She has to pay the consequences leaving behind her supportive family, friends and fiance and doesn't whine about her situation; instead she makes the best of it and takes notes of many of the injustices inside the prison system.<br /><br />Narrator Cassandra Campbell reads capably. I liked the sound of her voice which was soothing and likable as Piper and many of the other young women but when she's voicing some of the gruffer and/or older folks, or those with accents, she doesn't always fully succeed. Many of them sound too young or too sweet and not at all like the rough and tumble people many of them surely were. But I can live with that because mainly this is Piper's story.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in life inside a minimum security prison you should check this out. The routines, the character interaction and the complex relationships that develop inside the prison were fascinating and parts of it were even funny. I only wish Piper (or perhaps a co-author) had been able to imbue her recollection with the emotion that would have made it memorable.n a deeper level (especially Delicious) but instead Piper focuses more on the details and drudgery of her day to day life inside the prison and her minor epiphanies and thoughts.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Winter of the World, by Ken Follett is Book #2 of the Century Trilogy. It follows The Fall of Giants which was published in 2010 , and it covers the period of history from 1911 through 1924 with World War front and center.  Book #2, Winter of the World, is another hefty tome at nearly 1,000 pages covering the years 1933 through 1949, and follows the rise in power of Hitler and Stalin as well as World War II and Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />I was happy to see the (5) somewhat inter-related families return in this installment. The families run the gamut when it comes to nationalities - significant players include Americans, Russians, Germans, Welsh and Englishmen.  It's refreshing to see that once again, although a work of fiction, the story seems so very real because Follet has a way of expertly weaving \\"real characters\\" like FDR, and Harry Truman into the story.<br /><br />Expertly researched, the novel covers so many facets of life and global events from a major, worldwide economic Depression, unemployment, hunger, Hitler's rise, the atomic bomb and the bombing of Pearl Harbor -- I'm sure I left something out.  It's not all about history either, it's the dynamics between individuals and families that make this novel work so well. There is romance, touching scenes involving families, all of which result in an obviously page-turning story about a world in major turmoil.<br /><br />It's one of those series where once you begin reading, you'll be in for the long haul.
B0097BTSSS|3.0|I was so looking forward to having this. This is one of the worst sounding vinyl records I have. It's at least 25% lower in volume than even my worst albums. The quality of this should be looked at by the record company. It's too many songs per side, and if you are going to charge $20 on a vinyl it should sound pretty good. I'll revert back to the CD for this release, but it's disappointing that a big artist like this doesn't get a higher quality release on vinyl. It should have been put on a heavier weight vinyl and less songs per side to improve the quality of sound.

B007BLCGNU|1.0|1st Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand. 2nd Note: Amazon deleted my original review, so I have lightly edited it.<br /><br />I saw this film because I was interested in it, as Clint Eastwood directed it. However, the movie is a huge disappointment. It's too long, bloated and homoerotic. I mean homoerotic in that it's heavily implied that Hoover and Tolson were lovers (which was probably true), or that at the very least shared a mutual attraction for each other that went beyond friendship. A lot of scenes had either both of them holding hands and whispering heavy innuendo to each other, and one scene had Tolson kiss Hoover when Hoover mentioned that he'd been intimate with a woman. One scene is enough to imply their sexual perversion or mutual attraction to each other...and it CAN BE DONE DISCREETLY, instead of the shockingly overt manner in which it was portrayed (Hoover saying pathetically that he loved Tolson after the latter stormed out is the only example I can think of where a person's sexual preference can be implied without anything else).<br /><br />Rated R (a kiss between two men, two uses of a vulgar term for a gay person, a sexual situation between a female & a male via very suggestive sounds & shadows, one use of the f-word and some violence).
0671004107|5.0|Carl Sagan's Contact is a very well-written, enjoyable books that manages to get a scientific point across and be fun to read at the same time. Many books have approached the problems of first contact, but few have examined it as thoroughly as Sagan does here. Also, he approaches it in a different way from most. Rather than have the aliens visit the earth, the human race instead picks up artificial radio signals, which allows us to go to them.

There are various story lines that initially seem unrelated yet converge together like streams into a river. The description of the surroundings is so eloquent and makes you feel like you are right there in California. The plot can essentially be boiled down to good vs. evil. You can read the other reviews for more informative plot synopsis. Essentially you just NEED to get this book, sit back and enjoy.

B0084AYLK8|4.0|I found this book a very interesting read. Although I do not feel it is one of Hardy's finest, it was, never the less, entertaining. It did not seem to achieve the level of pathos, or engender the concern for the main characters that \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" did. There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens' \\"Little Dorrit\\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story. All said, I am glad I read \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\". I enjoyed it very much, I just didn't LOVE it.
B005JOHORO|3.0|I purchased this mainly because I had heard of them since the 70's but had never listened to them, plus I was going to a concert where they were in the line up.

The production on this album is terrific too.  Just not my style.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follet's sequel, second in  the Century series, is a difficult book to put down. It is story telling at its best, about British, American, Russian and German families during the World War II period. Character development follows the first book in the series that dealt with an earlier generation of the same families, but can stand alone so that the reader finds a continuing plot building out of a new generation unique in itself.Involves the reader with political developments and living personalities that shaped a history still at work today. Purchasing at Amazon for Kindle use makes the large volume of the book easy to handle for any age person.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|I loved the book, I think it puts things into prospective as far as were we are today.  Read it from cover to cover in about two days.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'll admit the only reason I read this book was because it was offered through Kindle's Lending Library. However I truly enjoyed it and thought Suzanne Collins did a fantastic job of drawing the reader into this fantasy setting, creating relate-able characters and developing the plot at a perfect pace. I will definitely read the rest of the trilogy.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Excellent production, different twist on Snow White, with an excellent cast to pull it off. I would recommend it to adults that appreciate fantasy.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|A little bit of drama, a little bit of comedy, and even some light thriller/horror- my husband and I both really enjoyed this movie.  Johnny Depp's roles are so versatile and he did not disappoint in Dark Shadows.  I would definitely watch it again.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Works well. Allowed me to access files on the kindle and browse the other computers on my home network. Also able to use the built in camera.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app,  it is a lot of fun for when I have a few minutes of extra time or when I am looking for inspiration. Easy to use also.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Truly enjoyed the book bar the end as that sightly let it down, when caricatures just kept on going even after just having been so close to death, this made it a bit unbelievable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game but its so laggy on my kindle fire. I play this all the time nd I always die beacuse of the lag
B005HSL626|2.0|I got the game because I had played it on an Ipad and loved it. I came to discover that it was Fruit Ninja Free HD that I was playing on the Ipad and it has more features than Fruit Ninja Free. Thinking about deleting it.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|People say that it is depressing, and in a way it is.  However: The fact that one man, a quite average guy, stood up and did so much for the Jewish people is encouraging.  Germans should take heart that in a time when their country seemingly went nuts, there were some with the courage and decency to take the risk and save people.  Acting was excellent.  Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley were as real as could be.  You had to admire Schindler, Hate Goth and love Stern.  The rest of the cast, right to the extras, was great too.  This is more than a movie; it is, like Schindler, part of history.  Shindler's list is at the top of my best flick list of my life (and I'm 65.)  and Schindler is one of my heroes.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I was really psyched about seeing PROMETHEUS and it was a big visual feast in an IMAX theatre with 3D glasses...but, afterward, thinking about the story...this movie was a wreck.<br /><br />There's a hilarious youtube video where one guy rants about all the things that don't add up in the film (and he's right).  I can't link it here, but it's really funny.  Some guy on a couch sitting next to another guy sitting mutely.<br /><br />Basically, scientists assemble cave drawings that point to an outer space connection to life on earth.  The aliens who probably started mankind, as well as life on earth, are called the Engineers and the scientists head into deep space to find them.  Good start.  Man searching for his origins.<br /><br />But then the story begins to fall apart.  And the scientists appear to be the dumbest people on this mission.  The usual corrupt elements who want to screw over the hapless humans on the mission to get alien specimens jump the gun for some reason and turn the crew into their little experiment...a long, long way from home...and threatening to cut off their way home...wait...WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE?  Knowing this film is somehow tenuously connected to ALIEN is like waiting for another better movie to barge into the movie you're watching.  And then it happens.  And you have no idea what's going on.<br /><br />But, hey, it looked awesome on the big screen in 3D.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The Game of Thrones peaked in book #3 for me.  These last 2 books have been dragging and not as exciting as the first three.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|instructions? must have screen zoomed in to start therefore you cant see the rest like you could in Angry Birds.  Off to delete this app.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book.  I typically go for girlie books and not american history, but I found this story to be exciting and a page turner. Would definetly reccomend.
B009EAO38C|5.0|combining the classics in music with new hits in a classical style by musicians who can actually play their instruments = music to my ears.
B004NS710C|4.0|I really like this movie, it is exciting, and has moments of humor, to help spice up the scary stuff. Hard working men, doing brave, manly stuff, and saving the day. What's not to like?
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not as good as I hoped but decent with great graphics. It is pretty much the average item finding game.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This book was soooooo good and i recomend that you read the entire seires. This is one of the best series i have ever read.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Great way to contact your friends from a mobile device. You can look in the store too. Send requests and accept them, this app is awesome.
006016848X|5.0|I loved this book so much and it helped not only my relationship with my boyfriend, but my brother and my coworkers. I have now bought 6 additional copies for other people. The book arrived quickly and in it's stated condition, so it was perfect. Thank you!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|These are my go to shoes. Comfy and, in my opinion, super cute since they seem give your feet a slimming look. I am normally a size 9 across the board, but with the Toms I a consistent 8.5, which makes sense, considering they tend to stretch with wear.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I am very happy with this blu ray. It has sound and sub titles in spanish. The images is excellent. I recommend it
B009VB97EY|4.0|I could not resist. I got sick of seeing the posts on facebook and pinterest-all about Channing Tatum and his hotness. I called double standard, because if it were a movie of women the women of the world would be slamming it. I love Channing though, and I do love to see him dance-which he does all over this movie. For all the female slobbering over this movie, it really is not what you would expect. It is choices and life decisions and knowing what you are worth.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I would like my money back! There is no reason this program should be sold in bits and pieces. It,s  rip!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Great movie. Great cast.  Great special effects, and great soundtrack. I don't understand why people were disappointed with it. This is an excellent movie for people who love the Fairy tale/Fantasy Genre. The dark mood  was perfect. Not too much corniness, a la LOTR.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Saw this at the cinema on 84th & Broadway, UWS, NYC, NY. The 3d in the theater was acceptable.<br /><br />Buy these 3D movies because I like 3D a lot. Have the latest 3D TV and 3D Blu-Ray player with the latest patches.<br /><br />Fact or fiction? Who cares. The news is such a lie that maybe they were covering up vampires in the days of Mathew Brady's reportage...<br />But now through gutsy journalism 150 years later they are revealing the truth. Who knows the World Trade Center lie may be cleared up starting with 9/11 is 911 the police emergency telephone number and what a hoax the telephone company and TV are in the year 2160.<br /><br />As far as 3D is concerned, the picture was pretty depth oriented a good deal of the time. Abraham Lincoln etc, lacked, regretfully, 3D in your face in many instances.<br /><br />I want ViewMaster 3D. I want pop up story book 3D. Spent a lot on equipment to have my 3D.<br /><br />Expect dynamite 3D and nothing less.<br /><br />Recommend this movie for a 3D experience even though the experience could be stronger.<br /><br />The plot, absurd. Who cares. It is ingenious and entertaining.<br /><br />I ain't no employee of no theater production company or Amazon.<br /><br />Want my 3D. 3D is what I want. If they could 3D at the San Francisco World's Fair, circa 1913 they must be able to turn out a better product than one a hundred years old. Yeah! Well, They ain't doing no such thing. Educational 3D discs are far better in 3D than movies at the theaters,
8866131350|2.0|Why fix what ain't broke, Moleskine? The whole reason I bought this was for the block calendars, and now they are gone. I wish I had read reviews FIRST. The size is perfect for my bag, but the new line design is going to be much more inconvenient when planning out my monthly schedules. Boo.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|The movie as a sci-fi thriller, murder mystery and a little humanity thrown in is entertaining. However, the 3D is for crap. If you want a 3D movie as it should be done, don't buy this. Brother, I'm disappointed in this Blu-Ray 3D flick.<br /><br />It is another example of the studios as a business entity lying to the sucka public. I feel as if a member of the carp family.<br /><br />Would have never bought this knowing the 3D was lousy and close to non-existent.<br /><br />Titanic has awesome 3D and it was originally made it 2D. I Robot has no excuses for this lackluster 3D. If it ain't true 3D then they got no right in calling no movie 3D. It proves again that 3D when I was kid is better than 3D now. I 'll be 69 in May 2013. Cardboard glasses work.<br /><br />This movie can be bought as a regular DVD for one penny plus $2.99 postage right here on Amazon. Sure, of course, the older DVDs have a sharper picture than newer DVDs.<br /><br />Once you open the packaging you can not get a refund.<br /><br />My 3D TV and 3D Blu-Ray player sport the latest patches, My equipment is state-of-the art.<br /><br />This studio stinks. Almost all the studios stink.<br /><br />Shame on Will Smith. The Fresh Prince stinks.<br /><br />Buy it for a penny. There are literally hundreds on Amazon selling it for 1 penny plus the $2.99 postage.
B00902MCVY|4.0|... I really dislike the fact that they released this in two parts. It makes sense for them financially I guess (2 x $9.99), but this makes for two short albums with Time I having essentially 3 f****n songs because two of them are short needless instrumentals! They really are great songs and the instrumentals are superb, but honestly I've heard enough of this from Nightwish and others! For that reason they lose 1 star for presentation.
B003MC5N28|5.0|the giver was a very good book and if you start reading it you wont be able to put it down it is the best book i ever read[[ASIN:0547995660 The Giver (Giver Quartet)]]
B00425S1H8|5.0|Loaded the driver and plugged it in. Works as you would expect. No issues to date.<br />Good quality build. I considered some of the shorter converters as well as some cheaper ones but this one rated well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was very well written...it kept my interest the entire time and really threw me off....however the ending could have been better....instead left me coming up with my own ending!!
B009K45Y62|5.0|There is a way to solve the problem of there currently being no plans for a \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\"--Blu-ray + DVD Combo With Limited Edition Bat-Cowl Display Case that would also include \\"The Dark Knight Reborn\\". \\"Reborn\\" is a documentary on the making of \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\". It seems that this documentary will only be available with \\"TDKRises\\"--Limited Edition Steelbook Best Buy Exclusive.<br /><br />Obviously, most all of us true fans would much prefer to own the Bat-Cowl plus \\"Reborn\\", and not have pay for both the Steelbook and the Bat-Cowl just to have the coolest packaging along with the documentary. Also, I am sure that we all want to know what contents will be included in \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\"--Ultimate Collector's Edition Set, coming in the fall of 2013, before we decide to buy \\"TDKR\\" in December.<br /><br />Since these products are manufactured by Warner Bros., please go to their website, bottom of page, \\"Help - Tell Us What You Think\\", take a survey and send them the following letter in the alloted text boxes. You may also go to the WBShop site, to the bottom of the page, find \\"Customer Service - Contact Us\\", and paste the same text into a message and send it to them. Feel free to write your own message, if you can. You may also print the following message and mail it to Warner Home Video, 4000 Warner Blvd., Burbank CA 91522. If enough of us participate, we may get the results that we deserve!<br /><br />Dear Warner Bros. Home Video,<br /><br />According to the BestBuy website, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\"--Blu-ray + DVD Combo with Limited Edition Bat-Cowl Display Case will NOT include \\"The Dark Knight Reborn\\", which is a documentary on the making of \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\". So Far, \\"Reborn\\" will only be available with \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\"--Best Buy Exclusive Limited Edition Steelbook.<br /><br />We the fans of the Trilogy and the loyal followers of you century's great roster of movies respectfully request that the Bat-Cowl Limited Edition be made to include the coveted \\"Dark Knight Reborn\\" Blu-ray Disc. While Steelbook packaging is cool, we many serious collectors will definitely much prefer to have the Bat-Cowl displayed on our shelves. But we do not wish to have to double-dip and buy both the Steelbook and Bat-Cowl, just to have the most prestigious packaging plus the documentary.<br /><br />If it is too late in the manufacturing process to have the \\"Reborn\\" BDs inserted into the Bat-Cowl boxes, then they may attached to outside of the box within a simple cardboard sleeve or else distributed in limited quantities to the first-coming customers. I am confident that Warner Bros. Home Video can find of a way to resolve this problem.<br /><br />Furthermore, please post the product details and box contents list for \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\"--Ultimate Collector's Edition Gift Set, which is purported to be released in early 2013, as soon as possible, hopefully before December 4th, which is when \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD. Doing so will enable us Batfans to decide on whether to acquire \\"TDKR\\" in December, or to wait for the Trilogy Ultimate Set.<br /><br />If there are some other powers that be that we should instead be contacting in regards to these issues, please forward this message to them or else let us know their names, phone numb#rs and/or e-mail addresses.<br /><br />Thank You So Much for hearing us!<br />Sincerely,<br />(type your name here)

0756697875|5.0|This is a good book that gives you a lot of info of bateman mini-figs and things you might not know. Great book if you like bateman and Legos.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|unable to download this on to my kindel fire, it aparently is not compatable with my kindel what a disapointment that is.
0756686970|5.0|Good book with mini-fig. If you like Star Wars and Legos it give you discripton of each mini-fig, thing you do know and things you don't know. If you collecate mini-figs this book is for you.[[ASIN:0756686970 LEGO Star Wars Character Encyclopedia]]
B003B02O7I|5.0|Loved it! Buy this book now but be careful if you read it on the train. . . You may miss your stop
B001JIHGO0|5.0|When I am getting in the mood for Halloween my family is watching this movie over and over again. We wore out the DVD so we actually re-bought it for Blue Ray. This is such a good movie and it combines a lot of monster legends. The cinematography is fantastic and I loved the costumes and drama as well. Excellent movie and my family never tires of it.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|i enjoy playing the game :~) until it freezes in the middle of playing :-[ really makes the game suck :%(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read.  It keeps you intrigued from beginning to end.  Love it and would recommend it highly.
0316228532|5.0|Started a bit slow but picked up very quickly.  Lots of twists and turns along the way!  I can almost see Pagford in my minds eye.
B003T6GVWI|5.0|Another great effort from Kylie. Her best CD ever?? I listened to this almost all the time for over a year straight whenever out walking/running, and it never got tiring. A few really great songs and everything is good. Really puzzling why some of these songs don't make it onto American radio.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I purchased the DVD copy, thinking I was getting the full length dance scenes. Except they arent there! What a joke. We dont own a Blu Ray player, so I didnt really want to get a combo pack. This is poor advertising.<br /><br />  Can anybody tell me if, in the combo pack, both the DVD and Blu Ray have the dance scenes? There is no way im going to order the combo pack and then find out they are only on the Blu Ray and have another bad dvd.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the bible study options we use this daily the family devotion is fun for my 8 year old son
B008SOS63S|5.0|The collaborations with John Hiatt, Paul Rodgers and Beth Hart bring an even greater life to his amazing skills as a guitarist and his voice continues to evolve into something where he can no longer be \\" a guitarist that sings a bit\\".  It seems the only reason he is not a huge star is because he chooses not to be.  Dont change a thing...it works.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An avid reader in the past, I am rekindling my reading with the extensive ebook library that exists.  This first book was captivating by forcing acceptance of a future that was both advanced and limited for the human species.  The segregation into specific districts defined by their specific contribution to the Capitol was interesting to unfold with references to a well known American geography.  The Capitol is not in the District of Columbia.<br /><br />The tests that are posed for the contestants are vigorous, yet primitive.  This is skillfuly manipulated by futuristic capabilities that add to the story.<br /><br />It was a satisfying adventure.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I think this story is a very good story for all kids and adults of any age. A nice clean cut story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I hadn't read a thriller in a few years so I was excited to read this book.  It was everything I hoped it would be and more.  The author was awesome at pulling you into the story and making you care about the characters.  The story was very well written.  I had a hard time putting it down to go to bed.  I loved this and and I will definitely be reading Gillian Flynn's other novels.  Read this, you will not be disappointed.
B000IB681Q|3.0|I loved this movie. I saw it originally in the theatre. Ally doesn't come off the same way she did back then; women were demure and when she said \\"bull shit\\", it was both shocking and endearing. This is very much a 70's film. If you are not from that time, unaware of all the issues, I think it falls flat where it would have been compelling.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of the best things about the British is that they always find ways to use their actors during long and distinguished careers, unlike the U.S. where we too often decide that actresses are over the hill at 30 (Sally Field playing Tom Hank's mother in \\"Forest Gump\\" when she was almost exactly the same age as her \\"son\\") or where we pair 60+ actors with 22 year-old ingenues in romantic comedies as if the actors don't look more like the ingenues' grandfathers than their lovers. \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is a slight movie in terms of plot and it is a little too neatly tied up at the end, but the performances of the seven wonders of the British acting tradition in this film, with the help of several talented younger Asian actors, make for an enjoyable experience and an acting lesson in how to play flawed (and sometimes not very likeable) characters with depth and compassion while avoiding the easy cliches the script might suggest. The film is often very funny, making use of British understated humor which depends more on character rather than situation. If you are older yourself (as I am) or if you can empathize with age, this film is a delight.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love this series! It is definitely worth reading and I would recommend it to anyone. I've heard mixed reviews from so many different people but it was actually very easy to follow and flowed very well.
B007704HO6|5.0|This book was fantastic. A heart warming tale about a former drug addict and lost soul trying to get back on his feet and stay clean, aided in no small part by his love for a stray cat! A must read!!!
B000YE3MZ2|5.0|I really love listening to this record. It's pure 80's at it's finest. If you are a Madonna fan, then this is an essential album to own!
B005IQZB14|3.0|I prefer to read non-fiction and this book did not disappoint. Her journey was intense, funny, soul searching. I recommend it for anyone who wants to know that no matter what kind of decisions are made in life, there is always the possibility for purpose and redemption.
0525953728|5.0|Riveting read. An inside look at what really happened up to and during the Bin laden mission. You'll discover what it takes to become one of America's true warrior heroes. I found it extremely difficult to put down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. And its free so that made it better. I use it all the time for everything. Would highly recommend
B008E374PO|4.0|Oh man this album so so so so catchy. If you want to have his amazing songs buzzing around youre head for weeks and weeks well then this is for you
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Prometheus has everything you would exspect from an alien film, great production values, talented actors, good sountrack, scares, suspense and should interest fans of the series as the film uses alien creatures designed by HR Gieger, which look like a disturbing cross between sex organs and something animal which is really what the film is working around and why some people dont know what the hell is going on the film. The film explores faith and religion and the origins of mankind a theme that was going to be explored in the third film but wasn't realised because of production problems. The film leaves alot of an questions, which is good as the aliens should have an air of mystery about them, and would leave the doors open for a sequel I hope. The performances are excellent especially Michael Fassbender and Charlie Theron and Niomie Raspace in the challeging role of female heroin after Sigourney Weaver, but the real star of the film is Ridley Scott who makes everything frame of the film look like a work of art and the film is innovative instead of going back to Ripley/survivers vs face huggars/aliens/alien queen sinario. Also I like the improvised scenes between Fassbender and Marshall-Green and a hilarious scene between Theron and ships captain played by Elba when out of nowhere he starts talking about sixties legend Stephen Stills, which for people who want to snigger at the plot and dialogue will be given a cheap thrill. Definatley worth seeing!
630529142X|5.0|The cool, crisp air of football season is about, and as such, pigskin fans need something to hold them over until next Sunday, when they can get their next fix of games. What better way to fill the football-less void than with this classic of comic cinema from the late 1990s? It goes without saying that any fan of Sandler or slapstick comedy will get a kick out of \\"The Waterboy\\". However, another demographic will surely get just as much enjoyment from it... those who love big hits! In \\"The Waterboy\\", Sandler's character delivers the most wicked, bone-rattling hits ever recorded on film. Sure, they're spruced up a bit by special effects, but damn! That water boy can HIT! Sandler's antics and interactions with the wild, whacky cast that was assembled for this gem is a real treat. Join him in his efforts to lead the lovable Mud Dogs to victory in the Bourbon Bowl, in this ridiculous spoof of the college football system.
0812993292|5.0|I just finished reading the Pilgrimage of Harold Fry And I loved it I felt that I was walking with him on his journey.  I enjoyed reading on how he decided to go a little farther to mail  his letter that it changed his ideas about people that he met. and how faith went with him on his journey.  I also liked it because of some surprises while reading this story.  It also brought me to tears. I really liked this person for who he was and what he became. I cant wait to read another book from this author.  ILOVED THIS BOOK.
B000EXZI1E|5.0|This CD has some great new songs from the Bee Gees. All of which are as far away from theit Disco Days as can be. For that reason alone I recommend getting it! It's like they completely reinvented themselves all over again. And I LOVE it !!
0393343405|5.0|The book should be mandatory reading for all university students no matter what their major as it chronicles the development of knowledge in its base literary format.  The insights it provides not only into philosophical emergence but the sciences as well, allows the reader to better understand and appreciate the accent of the educated mind.  The physical inscription process, the recordings man has made of his life and times on caves to stone tablets and then onto papyrus, parchment, paper to the digital age is itself filled with intrigue as the agendas of not only the authors but those who continued to transcribe their original works is a fabulous journey.  Before being directed to read assigned textbooks and other reference materials on curriculum directed subjects this is the first manuscript one should read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used this for over a month.  It works well. I enjoy having this on my kindle fire. Glad this is out there.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After the way book one concluded I was so \\"depressed\\" and \\"sad\\".  Dove in to the second book and read 120 pages in no time at all.  Really began to grow fond of Christian and Ana in FS Darker.  The plot twist in Chapters 13 and 14 took me by surprise.  Read this book twice as fast as the first one.  Absolutely loved the story and upon finishing immediately purchased the final book in the series.  Never have I become so engrossed and \\"wrapped up\\" in any character(s) as I did in this story.  Love, love, love this book.  Not for kids for sure...but quite enjoyable for a mature, sexually experienced married woman with children.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|slightly uncomfortable. This is definitely what everyone else said. $8 well spent on a pocket sharpener for a $8 pocket knife. More or less.<br /><br />dont expect miracles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Paced myself a little bit on this, the third and final installment in the series.  Enjoyed the continued development of the characters, the adventure, suspense and the romance.  The way Christian and Ana were so \\"in tune\\" with each other, the way Ana handle Elena, Grace and her reaction to learning of Christian and Elena's prior involvement...all these situations were so enjoyable and satisfying to read.  The Epilogue and SHADES of Christian - Fifty's First Christmas and Meet Fifty Shades were the perfect ending to the story as far as \\"wrapping it up\\" and bringing it all to a conclusion.  Thank you E.L. James for writing the trilogy.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Im a Burton Fan, but this was way off track.  The computer animation was terrible.  I feel bad for the actors; as they did their job.
B0090X4HES|5.0|I'm not going to do an extra-complex review, but I just listened to this whole album in one sitting and I loved it. EVERY song. Kanye's first CD is still one of my all times fav's, (before he got ahold of that koolaid from that pornstar), but this cd (and J. Cole's after this one) is a great 2012 refresher in the game, for me personally. It spoke to me because it was purely thoughts from a man's head about sides of life often forgotten, and not objects or big booty h**. So for me, this was a nice switch-up. Sorry Rick Ross.<br /><br />As far as the production, it is more simplified from the usual club beats (what a relief), it's got that studio session vibe IMO, but it's still catchy enough to keep me focused on the songs. It would've been super easy to make another 2chains, but he took the harder road to try and blow up( even mentioning his religion whoa). So I hope that even people that hate the album at least appreciate that form of personalization he put into it, and not spread negative speaking of another person like they did Lupe...now the poor man wants to quit the game...
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Being a PIC guy I thought I would never buy an Arduino. But the thing is: it is ready. Nothing to design, etch or solder. It simplifies most of your problems... If you need something more from your boards, design one using a PIC24. If you`re considering using something simpler, stick to the arduino.<br />The original board is inexpensive and well built... Deserves a try!
B0038KHTI0|5.0|The double album deluxe edition is really good choice for people who know and like the Avantasia style. It's cheeper to buy this box than \\"The Wicked Symphony\\" and \\"Angel of Babylon\\" separately. And you have also 40 pages booklet with documentary and photos about \\"The Wicked Trilogy\\".<br />Music is great as in all Avantasia albums.<br /><br />But, the box itself and digipacs in it are poor. The materials used for them are cheap. After few times of using I have scratches on the box and the paint from digipacs are gone in some places.<br /><br />Anyway, I can still recommend this item because of the music, the booklet (wich is well made) and the price.

B008WCP2PG|4.0|I loved the movie, for all the reasons everyone already listed (super hot man candy, sexy dance moves, acceptable plot), so I won't beat that dead horse. I just wanted to throw some info out there about the blu-ray extras.<br /><br />* Extended Dance Scenes<br />This is the whole reason I bought the blu-ray combo pack. I was super excited when I first started playing it; I thought it was going to be an extended scene for every guy. Imagine my disappointment when it ended after only three.<br />Joseph Manganiello in gold body paint: That little gold thong has to be stuffed. There's no way it's that big. That would be scary.<br />Matt Bomer as Ken Doll: This was so great, it almost makes up for the lack of more extras.<br />Adam Rodriguez as Navy Man: Meh. This one didn't do much for me. It was a lot shorter than the others, he didn't interact much with the audience, and pretty much ran off stage after getting down to his thong.<br /><br />* Dances Only Option<br />I forget what they actually called this option, but basically if you select this, it skips directly to all the dance sequences. I have a feeling I might wear this one out.<br /><br />* The Making of Magic Mike<br />This was interesting if too short. You got to see some different parts of the dance sequences than were in either the movie or the extended scenes. Also the actors talking about the dancing, and some fun behind the scenes stuff.<br /><br />That was really it for the extras. Kind of disappointing, but I like the movie enough that I don't care that much. And the blu-ray looked gorgeous on my TV, especially the Raining Men sequence.

1423113454|5.0|The Red Pyramid is the first book in the Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan.  I had high expectations for the Kane Chronicles, having read his Greek mythology series.  Rick Riordan, in the Kane Chronicles, uses the mythology of an older civilization, Egypt.  As in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, Rick Riordan had to give a lot of background information about some of the gods and goddesses to tie them to the plot line of The Red Pyramid. Rick Riordan gave the reader the background information in a way that tied into Egypt's mythology and history. The transitions to the background information were very smooth and they did not interrupt the plot line that much. Rick Riordan did a very good job writing The Red Pyramid so that you understood the mythology and history of Egypt, as he did in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of Greek mythology.  The Red Pyramid at first seems to be a very long book of five hundred fourteen pages in forty one chapters, but all that text is needed.  All of the information sets up the scenes for more books in the Kane series and starts the adventure of Carter Kane and Sadie Kane.<br />The action in The Red Pyramid is centered on the two main characters who are the narrators of the story, Carter Kane and Sadie Kane. Carter and Sadie switch the point of view in the Kane Chronicles many times.  Each time Carter and Sadie switch, you get their point of view of the events, and sometimes the views of Carter and Sadie over lap.<br />The basis of the story is around Egyptian gods and goddesses and the Magicians of the House of Life. In Egyptian mythology the struggle is not between good and evil, but chaos and order.  A god or goddess from our point of view may seem to have an evil character, but in Egyptian mythology, that same god or goddess may be the protagonist character of a legend.<br /> The House of Life was formed when Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun, gave mankind magic.  The magic was passed down from parents to children and blood lines formed. Carter Kane and Sadie Kane were part of a long blood line dating to two families when Egypt was ruled Egyptians.  Over the generations the bloodlines were forgotten and very few continued the traditions.<br />The plot of the story begins at a museum in London, where the Rosetta Stone was on display. Doctor Julius Kane, a magician and Carter and Sadie's father, was trying to revive his wife, Ruby Fausts, a diviner, meaning she could see the future, magician, and Carter and Sadie's mother. Julius Kane succeeded in his task, but at a great cost. He released Osiris, Set, Horus, Isis, and Nephthys. Dr. Kane was only looking to release Osiris, but they were all together. Each of the five gods and goddesses took a host of their choice, the gods did not try to take full control, and the battle began between the House and godlings and between Horus and Set, but a greater threat lies hidden.<br />I would recommend The Red Pyramid to anyone who enjoys reading mysteries, adventures, or history. Rich Riordan has done an excellent job telling the beginning of the struggle of order and chaos. The Red Pyramid is a great base for the Kane Chronicles. I have enjoyed this book very much and would recommend reading the rest of the Kane Chronicles.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|A Wanted Man is pretty typical Lee Child: an intricate plot, devilish bad guys, sufficient violence for most of us couch potatos, and a satisfactory ending.  His ultimate bad-guy face-off was a little too difficult to follow easily without a floor plan, so one just had to visualize the layout...okay, but not easy.  What the hell, we have to contribute something to the adventure!  All-in-all a fine read.  Yes, typical...but that's why I buy his books.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I don't know how he does it. Every single book he creates is a masterpiece.  My favorite thing about Riordan is how he doesn't go by the obvious. You can never predict what'll happen next. I would definitely recommend this book.

B003SI9WYG|5.0|I love this movie. We had just gone to Disneyland and ridden the Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion ride, so when we got back we were in the mood. It's the perfect mix of creepy holiday. Definitely Tim Burton's best animated movie, in my opinion.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|\\"Homeland\\" is totally enthralling, but after watching all the episodes on Disc One, there was a cast \\"commentary\\" included in the extras; unfortunately the gorgeous Clair Danes gave away major plot points concerning an assasin and the terrorists' target, thereby spoiling the suspense for Disc2 and 3. DO NOT listen to the cast commentary for Disc One until you have watched the entire season! Otherwise, \\"Homeland\\" is a superb thriller.
B00866JL96|5.0|Arrived very promptly! Love this movie and was so happy to get it for a decent price. This is a must have movie.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|For those who still need to watch the show. Just go ahead and give it a chance. The show is not about zombies or killing them, but The Walking Dead are the survivor characters. Which just makes this show great to watch as you see them evolve troughtout the series. Yes they do make stupid decisions but don't think that is just bad writing because that is how it's meant to be. The first two seasons are meant to show how they deal with the situation and how they are not used to anything like it. By the 3rd season you see how they have already figured things out and stoped being stupid. Which makes you feel proud of the characters and that watching each stupid thing they did was worth it. Now this show is based on comics (that are great!)so the foundation for the whole show is already there, just with some differences. Mostly what happens on the show varies in that some characters are taken off the show and things those character do in the comic are done by other character in the show. This makes it a lot more interesting for people who already read the comic because you don't really know what is going to happen to who, you just know it's going to happen. Can't wait till crazy events unfold in season 3 with the most sadistic villian -The Governor.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|She is the exact opposite of Taylor Swift! Lyrics are good and rough. Guitars are great. Couple of soft songs but well worth 10 bucks!!
B008NA3I30|4.0|Before I decide to rent a DVD, I tend to read the 1-star reviews to see if there might be some valid reasons for not renting it. I admit that I almost didn't rent this one because of some of the things said in the one-star ratings.<br />However, I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. It is definitely not one of your run of the mill \\"cheat on your spouse\\" movies. I found it lyrical, understated and subtle, with a haunting soundtrack that definitely added to the mood.<br />It was a two-hour movie. In my experience, most two-hour movies could have been condensed into 90 minutes, but I didn't find any \\"wasted time\\" in this movie. It kept my interest from start to finish.<br />Unlike some one-star reviewers who found the characters dull and uninteresting, I found them quite captivating. The movie provided some neat character studies.<br />Admittedly, some of the dialogue, particularly near the beginning, was a bit artificial and seemingly contrived. However, it overcame that after awhile.<br />And I felt the ending (the last 10 to 15 minutes) was a bit strange and disjointed, which detracted from the seamless flow that had been developed through the first 105 minutes.<br />Other than that, though, I thought it was an excellent movie.<br />Certainly, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, because not everyone would like this kind of movie. However, if you feel like relaxing for a couple of hours and experiencing how some people try to make sense of their relationships, this might be worth a look.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good read could not put it down. recommend to all.  Glade I read it when i did. That's all
B003B02O7I|5.0|Grisham can be known for some difficult to follow legalese, but this easy to read, emotionally compelling story was humorous and entertaining. Not what I expected from the author, yet totally entertaining! I was entrigued and compelled by not only a beautifully told story, but surprised by a well written ending. Everything I look for in a great book.

1451648537|5.0|There's not much more I can add to the thousands of reviews of this book. A very well-written and balanced account of one of the greatest innovators and titans of industry in history, Steve Jobs. While it speaks rightly of his one-of-a-kind ability to foresee trends and create or remake entire industries, Isaacson's book also talks honestly about Jobs' numerous shortcomings, especially with regard to his personality, bipolar view of the world, and often dreadful -- even abusive -- treatment of others, including members of his own family. That Jobs gave the author, Isaacson, the freedom to portray him as he really was with some terrible flaws is a testament to possibly the biggest takeaway from the book -- he did it his way. His is both an inspirational and a cautionary tale for anyone who wants to emulate him.<br /><br />Highly recommended and five big stars.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Headhunters is Norwegian and has subtitles but don't let this deter you.  The tight logical plot is easy to follow and provides some thrilling action.  It is one of the best of its genre I've ever seen.
B000000WGL|4.0|Great little Rock/Funk/Blues/Obligatory Ballad album from The Stone's axe-man.<br />Richards sticks to what he knows best with this record, unlike Jagger, who seems obsessed with constantly trying to modernise The Stones music, which usually end up sounding flat & a little sad.<br />Richards vocals on this record aren't bad either, admittedly he's closer  Dylan than Pavarotti, but they don't distract from the music.<br />This album didn't change the musical landscape upon it's release, but it's certainly stronger that a lot of Rolling Stones albums since \\"Some Girls\\".

B0094BB4TW|3.0|obviously not as easy to navigate as on a cpu but not too bad. Took a little getting used to.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Overall, hands down, this movie has all the elements I'm looking for. The best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), the best actress (Kate Winslet), and the best supporting cast of all time. I mean, Mali Finn really did a stunning job casting actors and actresses that resembled their real life counterparts. Isn't it amazing how similar Kathy Bates compares to the real Molly Brown? Even Mr. Ismay and Mr. Andrews had actors that portrayed them really well. I could say the same thing for the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Thematically, this film was everything beyond it's time, and I think it's everything beyond our time today. Avatar is an exception, as there are many recurring themes throughout both movies (love, technology, man vs. nature, etc.) and the fact that James Cameron wrote them at the same time, still an amazing movie regardless. The fact that Titanic speaks on so many levels, and the fact that it was an event that really happened, makes this a journey I had to experience over and over. Of course, one of the reasons the story is so good is because DiCaprio and Winslet did an absolutely unbelievable job working together and putting out work that is instilled in all of us.<br /><br />Visually, this film was years ahead of technological feats. I mean, for a 1997 film, they really went in and created lifelike digital water that could stand today. There are plenty of other feats they accomplished that were years ahead, but the most important part is that they did their job of engrossing us into the movie that makes us watch it over and over again.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic movie that will stand the test of time. The story captured us, the themes inspired us, and the drama overwhelmed us, but most importantly, was a powerful message: \\"only life is priceless, and to make each day count.\\"
B005USZYDU|3.0|easy reading but not as intriguing as Grisham's other more intricate books.  more of a short story and interesting but thats all.
B00913P6G0|5.0|This is a true film in sound form. I sat down and listened to the whole album from start to finish, on my Senny 598's of course, and the way Kendrick can paint an image of what is happening is beyond extraordinary. His story-telling ability is through the roof, his technique is stupendous, and his combination of the two makes him a master chief in the game. Marvelous job on a remarkable album, Kendrick Lamar. Enjoy a classic in the making. 15 years from now, we can say we experienced a rare breed of talent come through and really wish we could go back to these days.
B001J9EHSC|4.0|In general, Fiona Apple is an extremely talented singer, songwriter and composer with a formidable knack for channeling raw emotion.  \\"Tidal\\" is a very strong debut that effectively showcases the young Fiona's burgeoning talent.  The album mixes her rough edges with sadness, humor and a surprising youthful sweetness. My personal favorites from this album are 'Sleep to Dream', 'Criminal' and 'Never Is A Promise'.  Overall, I highly recommend this album.  Enjoy!
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game that seems to never end.  Just don't like that u have to pay to play after a certain point.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was a fast read that would be great at the beach. It gives us all something to think about....what would you do in that situation? How would you feel if someone you loved did really bad things? Emotions are high in this fun read and when you think you have it all figured out.....a huge twist happens and it evokes thought.....not great but really good.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love it because it makes you try to beat the machine and is more challenging than the regular one
B0063GORYU|2.0|I love spider on the computer so I downloaded Amazon's Spider solitaire on my smart phone. When I got to the point of no more moves and wanted to shut it down I couldn't find any way to stop it, shut it down, or delete it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is lots of fun. You don't have to &quot;buy &quot; anything.  As you progress through the levels and acquire more neighbors you get more items with the money. (The game money,  not real money.) You have the option to spend real money,  just like other apps. TeamLava,  great update with the autoche k for sending neighbors gifts. :-)
B0076DCT2G|1.0|After reading about 30 pages I deleted this book from my Kindle.<br />John Corey is extremely irritating with his stupid remarks. I had the urge to give him a good SLAP. I hope the extremists beheaded him to shut him up.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Interesting.. The theme of why the main character is the way he is (shades of Grey) developes throughout the book, as well as in the following books.You really need to read all three books to appreciate the development of the story.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Mayer Hawthorne's Strange Arrangement is one of a handful of cds that I can listen to from beginning to end without having to skip a track. He's phenomenal-the harmonies-the lyrics-the catchiness of the songs definitely stick out from the junk that other performers having been attempting to pass off as music.
1442444053|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new book! I am a huge Watership Down fan, and I thought it would be nice to see another illustrator's perspective. I own the versions illustrated by John Lawrence, so I have a good basis for comparison.<br /><br />This new edition is hardcover, although it lacks a dust jacket. In contrast to John Lawrence's subtle black, white and grey drawings, Aldo Galli's illustrations are vivid, futuristic looking color renderings.<br /><br />If you are a traditionalist looking for a new printing in the old style, you will be disappointed. I am a huge fan of John Lawrence's originals, but I like most of Galli's images. It is a very different approach, but I think that is what makes it fun! They do a nice job of conveying the upbeat or dark mood of each scene.<br /><br />Aside from the lack of a dust cover, the quality of the book is very good, with good quality printing and paper. The print is fairly large, which is great for aging and young eyes alike!<br /><br />For the price, you cannot go wrong, and if you have never seen an illustrated version of this book, it is a treat. If you can find an old John Lawrence illustrated version, buy it for a contrast. There are two versions, a limited edition of 250 that is nearly impossible to locate, and a regular edition that is hard but not impossible to find.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a bot, programed by Hugh Howey,  my purpose is to SPAM Amazon with great reviews and 5 stars rating on his work.<br />Great book, Great Author<br />I really liked Wool, picked it up early in 2012 because I spotted it at a cheap price ! Yes I'm cheap.<br />I'll probably end up buying every books he writes from now on and before they actually go a cheaper price!<br /><br />I don't want to say to  much about the book in this review, There are a few unexpected twist and I hate reviews that end up saying  too much.<br /><br />It's cheap, don't worry, pick it up.

B004JN1CW4|2.0|Ok so this was one of the most disappointing endings to any series i've ever read. First of all their were so many plot holes you couldn't tell what was happening half the time. Also in the second book....Brenda. I mean, who really gives a crap about her? She  is really only their to fill in plot holes and make the book longer so they can charge you more for it. In the last book she is only their to complete the &#34;love story&#34; part of the book. When Teresa died in the last book, i just about lost it. How could Dashner just kill her like that? And Thomas didnt really care at all about it. I mean I know he is mad at her and all,but just forgive her. She was just doing what she thought would save his life, and he seemed so heartless about it.<br /><br />Then their was the way they talked. If you had everything in your mind erased except your name, you wouldn't  be able to talk. The author seams to think that somhow the never forget how to talk.<br /><br />A lot of the review's that say the book was good, say that it is perfectly clear how the flare started. People who say this, please tell me…………HOW THE HE** DID IT? l?!!!!?!?!!???!<br />The author never ever ever ever ever ever ever says how it did, and is probably never going to. They also never explain why WICKED hd to go through all that sh** to find a cure for the flare. Why couldn't thay just study people's  brains to figure it out.<br /><br />The book was a really big disappointment, and most fans of the series will think so too. But i guess if you just finished the second one, and wnt an ending, read the last book. (even if the author did a poor jod with it).
0307278409|5.0|A fascinating exploration of the linguistic and cultural peculiarities that can make it difficult for people of different backgrounds to understand, let alone love, each other. As a linguistic experiment alone, the book is already worth reading. The author does an excellent job of showing the protagonist's gradually improving command of the English language, and the subtle transformation from a foreign student's hilariously crippled narrative into a fully competent one is utterly believable. It's also an effective literary device: I found my own reader's view of \\"Z\\" as a charmingly naive visitor to an alien world shifting accordingly, to the point where I realized how much her limited grasp of the language had coloured my initial perception of her as a person. As her English communication skills improve and her understanding of the host culture grows, \\"Z\\" paradoxically becomes only more estranged from it. Again, the more I learned to appreciate Z's difficulties in adapting to an alien world view, the more my own perspective shifted away from an ingrained, uncritical familiarity with Western values and sensibilities to the vantage point of a visitor who finds these neither transparent nor self-evident. It's the kind of paradigm shift you usually only get after an extended absence from your own country; this book is therefore a must read for the serious armchair traveler. Intriguing, funny, sometimes cute and sometimes shocking, this book is strangely refreshing in spite of the unhappy undertone... I love it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While I have enjoyed the past Hunger Games books, this one I was a little disappointed with. It seemed to drag out and the ending was what I expected, but didn't want to happen.
0316228532|5.0|Recognizing that Harry Potter is for younger readers, although many adults enjoy the novels as well.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is most definitely for adults. It bears up well under comparison to William Faulkner: a small town populated by characters who run the gamut of human frailty, the human heart in conflict with itself.<br /><br />I loved it and hope that this is just the start of a series of novels about this postage stamp of native soil.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I loved this movie! It's about a man (Hugh Jackman) who takes in his son for a couple of months. Robots replace humans for boxing matches and father and son rebuild a robot for boxing. You can't not love the underdog in this movie..very heartwarming.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|This is a sprawling story that may or may not be one's cup of tea. Thankfully, it was mine, because it's also quite a hefty thing, as Mr Franzen tends to do. I think the other reviews have gone over the story - I found it very easy to sink into the world of the family B, see through their eyes and experience. The \\"4th\\" wall was very much intact for me. The story winds around and touches on common subjects (marriage, kids, career, neighbors) that you can laugh at, cry with, whatever, but also weaves in the birding, the environment, and possibly a great other many things that you had forgotten (college after life) or want to forget (family trials). One might say much of it was superficial - if you want to take that camp, then it holds water. But if you want to enjoy the technical skills or a writer who follows his characters around to the point of excessive, then seamlessly switches to another character to also develop, then a third, moving back and forth with such skill that the reader does not tire nor does the story lose momentum (momentum being relative here, this is a steamboat pace, a walk in the park, no joggers), then this is a wonderful book to enjoy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|started playing this on my husbands ipod when we were on the plane to cabo...so much fun I downloaded it to my kindle..
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Given the subject matter and as a book lover and a completely converted Kindle user, I found it ironic that I couldn't put this book down, or rather, I had to find it on whatever Kindle app was handy so I could keep reading.  At one point I was reading at 4am on my iPhone 5 under the covers like a kid.<br />It is such a modern story and so directly addresses the collision of new technology and the emotional and intellectual yearning for knowledge, old knowledge, substance; SOMETHING REAL ( and not housewives or Kardashians.)  It is also an adventure story, a coming of age story and a mystery.  The voice is fresh and the writing is good.  The climax leaves something to be desired, but the ride is fun.  It takes you to the place where all good books should, reading under the covers at 4am.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great ending.....the characters stay with you and the story line grabs you from the very beginning.  I can't wait for the third ( and possibly more) installment(s)!  Know what I'll be reading New Years Day...,

Cut the Rope is toatally worth the money. What I like about the game is that it is cheap and you don't have to pay for extra stuff during th game. It is a game of skill and it's hard, which I like. If you are thinkng about bying this game, please do so. It is a great game. Remember my name and listen to my reviews. You won't regret it.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was funny and it showed the real-life problems that an engaged couple could encounter when one of their careers is taking off and the other one is already established.  Emily & Jason, both did a great job of acting.  Highly recommend this film!  :o)
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Hi. My name is studmuffin. I am on the road of fame to become the best critic of all time. If you support my critism about this game, then please listen closely to what I have to say. The game is fun don't get me wrong, but the levels are quite easy, and when I got this game on my old Kindle, it wasen't free, but now it is! So, basically, I just wased my money. What a rip off! And  I'm not done yet. There's not much levels and there's not much planets. And to top it off, there's one planet that costs extra money! That's crap! If you are thinking about getting this game, take my advise and don't. Remember my name. I will make sure that you don't get ripped off.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Puzzle games are fun sometimes, but other times you just want a fun, brainless action game. Sure, it looks a little young for me (numerically I've been an adult for quite a while) but I don't care cause it's fun, and not too easy to find all those paperclips. And he looks so cute when he spins on his double jump. The dragon run game doesn't work so well, it'll be fine for a while and then he just won't jump. But the actual game is good. :)

1609611543|5.0|I'm still reading this book, but so far I've been totally amazed at some of the things the author asserts regarding government recommendations for foods that continue to addict us and increase our fat and blood glucose levels.  The basic reasoning on this is something that I've been slowly coming to believe from other authors and experts on health, but this book explains why things work the way they do now because of the tinkering that has been done with plant dna.  Truly enlightening and well worth the read!!!
1439152802|5.0|What is the cost of keeping a secret? How much does it affect your life? Laurel Nicholson is sixteen years old and enjoying life, when she sees her mother surprised by a visitor. Laurel is the witness to something so shocking that she buries it for fifty years. But....<br /><br />This is the story of three young people who meet before WWII and find themselves totally connected forever. Their lives may have seemed separate later in life, but one of them has to tell the story. That one is Laurel's mother Dorothy. Laurel had put that awful day behind her and had become an actress. But her mother was turning ninety, so she went home for a visit and found it was time to ask the questions she had buried for so long. As Dorothy tells her story, she introduces Vivien and Jimmy. The reader is treated to new facts through the use of flashbacks, and is transported through time from before WWII through the 60's and to the present. Will Dorothy tell the whole story? Will Laurel accept or reject what her mother has to say? The story will keep readers enthralled as they travel through time unraveling mysteries and deceptions, finding friendship and passion.<br /><br />I love Kate Morton's writing and have since she wrote \\"The House At Riverton\\" in 2006. Her stories and characters pull me in quickly and I am transported through time with their memories. Readers of all types will enjoy Ms. Morton's books, and I for one can't wait for the next one. There are many lively topics that reading groups will enjoy discussing. I received my free review copy from Atria Books through Net Galley.

B008Y7Y0AM|4.0|As most would expect, this is quite familiar My Dying Bride material in as much as that there sound is mature and unique to them.<br />On the first few listens through it seemed to have a bit more in it to me than their last couple of albums but time will tell how this develops.  This may also be in some ways due to the production, but the opening track \\"Kneel TIll Doosday\\" is  certainly an attention getter.  While there are many other great parts on this album, it is this first song that right from the start says \\"pay attention\\".<br />Would I say this is their greatest album ever?  No.. I still prefer their first three full lengths personally.  Is it a high quality album?  Yes, for sure.  Do I recommend that you buy this?  If you are already a My Dying Bride fan, you probably already know what to expect and have made a decision to purchase this or not - so I do not expect to sway anyone there...  if you are new to the band, check out the song mentioned above, \\"Kneel Till Doomsday\\"... if you like it then you will like this album I think.<br /><br />Are you a collector type?  Make sure you get the version with the DVD, the hour+ interview with the band members is interesting enough for a couple of $ more.<br /><br />All in all, not an absolutely essential album, but a very good album that will sit well with a lot of their current fans... this may also be my favourite album of theirs that has been released in the 2000's.<br />4 stars for a strong album.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I have played minecraft on my kindle for months now...yes on 4shared.com... it is a great game and I love the Pc version.... however this is NOT the Pc version... there is.almost no caves and the crafting is all done automatically. no servers or multiplayer either...so its not as good but is still pretty good... however a game called blockstory is very good with more mobs such as dragons and sharks and you can get quests and more weapons...also there is the real crafting system and its much cheaper... so until we get more upgrades and a price reduction I suggest blockstory as it has much more variety and its cheaper
B000W93CHC|3.0|I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON HOPING FOR A CONTINUATION FROM PILLARS OF THE EARTH.  IT COMMENCED THREE GENERATIONS LATER WITH MUCH THE SAME STORY LINE.  DESPITE THAT, I DID ENJOY READING THIS AS I HAVE KINDLE AND CAN PUT IT DOWN AND PICK IT TO READ ANYWHERE.  BOOK BUT I DO NOT THINK I WOULD READ  A THIRD.  A BOOK MADE INTO A CRONICLE IS NOT SO BAD IF CONTINUES FROM ONE BOOK TO ANOTHER.<br />STARS OUT OF FIVE, I WOULD GIVE 3 STARS.
0307959856|2.0|This is not a work in homage to Pride and Prejudice, but a story largely devoid of the insightful musings for which Jane Austen is noted. Instead, it appears to have an apologist's slant. It does present a passable foray into the writing style of the early 19th Century, and the initial section provides a believable setting for the idyllic married life of Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam Darcy. And, there is a properly intriguing mystery surrounding a death that questions, once again, the extent of the villainy of our ever-present antagonist, Mr. Wickham.<br /><br />From that point on, however, I was startled to find our two bright minds completely at a loss and perfectly willing to sit passively while events unfolded around them. The majority of the book is taken up with rehashing the tragic event with no effort on anyone's part to suss out the peculiarities. I don't understand why a mystery author would take two such mentally vibrant characters and write them as weak and ineffectual types who are seemingly stymied by social convention. These are not your usual Austen protagonists. Elizabeth seems concerned only with dealing with the domestic challenges, while Darcy, though initially active in heading up the search party that discovers the murder scene, can't even manage to handle with authority the duties of a witness, much less take any active roll the story's resolution.<br /><br />Even the climatic events simply unfolded around Darcy, a mute and inactive observer. As Wickham is found guilty of the murder, there is an outlandish suicide (a mysterious woman in the courtroom runs out into traffic), followed then by a deathbed confession (really?) from the real killer.<br /><br />All curiosities of the story are eventually resolved, but only through a series of other unsolicited revelations. The only part for the Darcy's in all this is to listen to the confessions and to provide the funding to send Wickham and wife off to America where they can get away from all the sad events that were, yes you guessed it, ultimately caused by Wickham after all.<br /><br />If that were not enough, James completes her book by adding insult to injury, quite literally. For some reason James felt compelled to expand Austen's ending with Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam deciding to explain and apologize for their early faulty judgments of one another, as though these points wouldn't be obvious and unnecessary to such people, much less to Austen's readers. I see no reason to add this in a sequel.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Great movie! It was very full of suspense and action, but not so much action that it was not believable. We have watched it several times since it first came out and have enjoyed it every time. To me, it was very scary because I think the premise was very possible to actually happen. Makes me want to lock my granddaughters up.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I love the walking dead comics. I have read them since 2005, and because of this--I may have a bias.  This being said, I absolutely LOVE this show.  It is among my favorite shows, if not #1. (Along with Breaking Bad and American Horror Story). Season 1 contains doesn't quite fulfill my need of zombie-intake, but I believe that the emotional connection is what makes it a truly remarkable show.  Every time a character is alone, you worry something is going to happen to them.  This is because of the show's success in luring you closer and closer to each character.  I could rant on and on about the exceptional aspects of this show, but I believe it'd be best for YOU to be the judge.  If you are into zombies, and dramas, then the Walking Dead is DEFINITELY for you.  You will not regret it, I promise you that.  The only negative feature I could think of is the lack of a good CGI, but the unique zombie-kills make up for it.<br /><br />The product itself (3-Disc Special Edition) has a decent design.  It opens up to a cartoon drawing of the characters alongside a painting of the iconic zombie, and pictures of zombies on the discs. There are some webisodes (that you can watch for free online) and a few commentaries featured on the special edition disc, but nothing that makes this a truly essential buy.  It is a must-have for hardcore Walking Dead lovers, but if you ONLY like the show, then I suggest buying the regular blu-ray edition. The only complaint I have is that the product shipped with a crack on the blu-ray case, but that is reasonably irrelevant to future purchasers as it is particular to me.<br /><br />Besides that, I recommend this show to all zombie lovers!
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book reminded me of a Chris Bohjalian book.  Troubling issues, but so well written that it is a joy to read.  I'm looking forward to her next book whether it is another HP, another like this one, or something totally different again.<br /><br />As many others have said, this isn't a Harry Potter book.  It isn't even a book Harry Potter might want to read.  There is no positive correlation between enjoying HP and liking this book.  If anything, people who liked the HP series might be somewhat less likely to enjoy this book.  But that doesn't keep this from being an excellent book.  It is possible to love both -- I did -- but many people won't.<br /><br />In Casual Vacancy, Rowling takes us on a tour of the internal life of what might appear to outsiders to be the idyllic British village.  She shows us a vision of the world that many of us might prefer to ignore.  If HP showed us the optimist version of Rowling, Casual Vacancy shows us the pessimist Rowling.  Families that should be strong are actually unhappy when you get a glimpse of their inner lives.  And as Tolstoy said, each is unhappy in its own way.<br /><br />This could have been a depressing book to read, and there are certainly sad points in it.  But it also a book of redemption.  Many of the characters do grow and improve through the several weeks covered by this book.<br /><br />I read a lot of books just to escape and have fun.  Mysteries, historical fiction, and some non-fiction.  Other novels force me to think and examine life.  This book comes from the second group.  Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy reading it.  I did.  Once I got started, I couldn't put it down.  But I wouldn't recommend it for an airplane trip or a day at the beach.
0345803507|4.0|I liked more the first two books, but this one is still is a good read if you like romance + sex, and some action.
B000002G8J|5.0|To tell the truth, I only found put about this album about a month ago and even though I'm a huge music person and very into classic rock, I had never listened to that much non-radio album solo Clapton. Then a friend played me this album. It is freaking amazing. I have never posted a review on amazon before and the only reason I'm doing it now is because I want to know everything there is to know about this album and when I google it the only thing that comes up are bullshit reviews by people with no taste in music saying how weak it is. Trust me here people, if you have good taste in music, you will love this album.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|After listening to this highly controversial album, I understand why so many reviewers have to feel a extreme hatred for this combination. Indeed, I guess many of them are relatively young matallica fans or are the ones who just remember the name \\"Lou reed\\" singing and playing softly \\"Sunday morning\\", \\"Femme fatale\\" or chanting melancholically \\"pale blue eyes\\". However, some old minor fans, who have been heavily influenced by and enthusiastic for white light/white heat-styled repetitive chaos for a long time, can deeply appreciate what such an old reed wants to express intensively, strongly, and beautifully. About this album, I think there is so much room for being reappraised, and just for me, He surprises me once again after a long time. I really enjoy this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this app!!!  I also LOVE Survival Mode!!!  GET THIS THING NOW OR SUFFER BOREDOM!!!!!  Who in the world would take away such an offer...  All this app needs in minecrafts, and life in the minecraft world would be better!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has once again produced something above the ordinary. Secret Keeper easily meets the high standard set by her other books. It is not just another deep-dark-family-secret story, primarily because of Morton's excellent prose and evocative imagery. When I describe it as riveting, I mean that I read it from start to finish rather than sleeping, and it was unquestionabbly the right choice.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice big face and great look. makes basic functions easy. the large full display makes usage easy and attractive. so far do good
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have always been a Follett fan just love the way he tells a story.  In Winter of the World he continues his brilliant writting and story telling and just makes you want to read faster and faster to see what happens to these wonderfully developed and real characters.
1451637500|5.0|I have just read the entire so-far published series of the Vorkosigan saga, and loved it all.<br />Thinking back on the whole series, I could recall only two critiscisms.<br />\\"Ethan of Athos\\" was a bit below the standard of the other books; it was bit lightweight and didn't advance the series.<br />And Ekaterina somehow, and inexplicably, morphed from the character she was when she first appeared in \\"Komarr\\", to something very like Miles' mother.<br />Apart from those two (minor) comments, I found the whole series enthralling. The characters are well-drawn, believable and develop from one book to the next. The world-building is superb, the action, suspense, adventure and touches of romance just great.<br />Cannot recommend highly enough!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this series.  Had to watch it on my Kindle Fire.  I wish PBS would air it so everyone could enjoy this heartwarming series.<br /><br />Laura is so beautiful and Dorcus is so lovely and very wise.  I love the historical value and the human struggles of the poor in England.  I like it so much I purchased the DVD and sent it to a friend.
1451695195|5.0|I received Dr. Alexander's book today, quickly read it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />I find the book absolutely convincing, as his account of the higher dimension ties with accounts that I have read elsewhere, e.g., The Ra Material, Seth Speaks, Secrets of the Saucers, The Doors of Perception, David Wilcock's columns.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's background -- academic and clinical neurosurgeon, NDE skeptic, nominal Christian -- made him a perfect, impeccably credible spokesman for his experience, examination of it, and the resultant conclusions.<br /><br />I think that his account may help awaken humanity as we move closer and closer to December 21, and what I think will be our move into a higher dimension.  My sense is that his experience was divinely directed and his book was divinely inspired.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Best movie I have seen all year.  Worth it all.  Although it has a few things that seem similar to Transformers, it still delivered the action in it's own unique way.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action.  The fights are awesome.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is the best new album by Rush in years.  I know that they have a newer one now but this one is incredible.  The live show for this tour was also great.  Too bad they are now only touring in the larger arenas again.  Saw them in Dallas 3 times in a medium sized outdoor venue and it was great all 3 times.  This time they are at American Airlines so I will pass.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|First of all. I do not recommend this book for younger then high school. Simply because I don't think they can handle such a beautiful book without being immature about it. I picked this book up because I wanted to see the movie but it wasn't showing in my area. second I read interviews with cast and author. That aside. I fell in love.<br /><br />I read this book in a day. And completely understood and loved the characters. All of my life, never had real friends until junior year of high school. I always quietly observed others. It was wonderful to read a story about someone similar but different then me. Someone who truly sees a person. Someone who listens and learns and observes and loves. Someone who learns all of the awkward and heartbreaking parts of becoming a teenager, through his own and others eyes. I love this book and I'm asking people who read it not to read it because there is a movie. Not to read it because its what everyone is doing. Read it for yourself. Don't read it and skim it. Read it in depth. A part of me likes that I bought the kindle version because I do believe this book is going to be reread by me over and over.<br /><br />Please read this book with an open clear mind. Please read it. Enjoy it. Laugh and cry with it. It is wonderful. But I do not think for everybody. I don't think just anyone can truly understand this book. But I urge you to try.

B007THA4FI|4.0|This book was not at all what I expected. That aside it was filled with characters that were fully drawn and multifaceted. I really came to care about these people and therefore was rather disappointed with the ending and that us why I only gave it 4 stars.
0062193929|4.0|Patti's voice and accent make this story about her devotion to art, and to Robert Mapplethorpe, even more interesting than the words on the page.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|Nesbo continues to intrigue and amaze with twists and surprises and an uncanny ability to make his characters real. Love all his books!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a fun game the more you get into it.  It does not require the internet to keep playing it.  Their is also many different variations to the game.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was a little disappointed.  I thought this was like the original version.  It is nothing like the original version.  This one yet settle and create a town.  You do not actually travel the Oregon Trail like the original version.  You can only play so far before you need to use the internet to download more items to play.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Slow to load.... and it has frozen up on me once.  But having said that, it's worthwhile anyway.  I picked it up as an Amazon freebie, but I would definitely buy it.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|I went to see Magic Mike with my 60 year old mother, and we had a BLAST!  This movie gave us the opportunity to laugh together and enjoy a bit of naughtiness we wouldn't have had otherwise.  The men in the movie are gorgeous, and it DID have a good storyline.  I thought the story really did a good job at portraying what the sex industry can do to a person over time, and how what you thought was the perfect job in the beginning can really be a let down.<br /><br />I plan on buying this for my mother's birthday!!!  I know that she and I will watch it together and get the giggles all over again, just like the first time.
B004C0WVP6|4.0|Let's be honest, there are not a lot of things to review when it comes to an internal hard drive.  The main things are if they work and if are stable.  I ordered four of these for a NAS device (the [[ASIN:B0049MPQGS Synology DiskStation 4-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS411J (White)]] if you're interested) and one of the drives was dead on arrival.  Amazon replaced it quickly and the system has been running for 10 months with no drive problems what so ever.  The speeds I'm getting are exactly what would be expected with the NAS device running in RAID 5.  I'm getting about 30MB/s writing to the drive and 60MB/s reading from it which is more than fast enough to stream HD content.<br /><br />I'll update this review if any of the other drives go bad, but as of now all the tests show perfectly working drives.  I'd definitely recommend these drives.

B008NEMPTO|4.0|Perfect popcorn movie with lots of action . 3D is top notch so I highly recommend if you are looking to try out that new 3D TV . Great movie to have in the library for THE Halloween season year after year.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I purchased this product based on the positive reviews here and I am honestly sorry that I did.  Thankfully Amazon is great about returns.<br /><br />One of the primary reasons I purchased the headset was for the G Keys that would allow me to bind a Ventrilo push to talk.  However, all that happens after mapping the function in the G930 software is that the software crashes after pressing the G key.  It never did transmit the signal to Ventrilo.<br /><br />Now one would hope that updating the software would fix the problem.  I honestly could not tell you as the updated software that is supposed to run all of the Logitech devices would never detect the headset.  Add to that the fact that as long as the software was active, the headset could not establish a connection with its receiver.  Less than 5 seconds after I closed the software.  Connection.  Kind of pointless when the software is needed to run all of the advanced features like 7.1, G Keys and voice morphing.  An hour long support call to Logitech did nothing to resolve the issue.  The best the tech could tell me is to use the older software.  I would have been fine with that and probably kept the headphones if the G Key functionality actually worked with the older software.  Sadly, no such luck.<br /><br />I also had a lot of comments on the mic quality being horrible and choppy while in Ventrilo.  I cannot totally blame the headset for this as I stopped messing with the configuration after two hours of irritation with everything else.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this headset 2 stars is the audio quality and comfort.  I watched a couple of movies and listened to music and the quality was great.  If all I was looking for was a set of wireless headphones, I could not complain about the quality.  The headset, while large, is quite comfortable and I have a VERY large head.
0385344333|4.0|I bought \\"A Wanted Man\\" in Hardcover and enjoyed it I then sent it to my Dad for his birthday...can't do that with an e-reader. Be careful folks.
B005LAIHZE|2.0|This is simply an awful spectacle.  Historically, Lincoln has little resemblance to this infantile character (e.g. Lincoln did not support emancipation until the very end and only as a means to finally end the war.  Slavery was not an issue that was \\"dear to his heart.\\" In fact, he punished the \\"anti-slavery crowd\\" severely when they broke the law and was in favor of runaway slaves being returned to their owners).  This vampire hunter spends most of the screen time ranting anti-slavery slogans as if he were John Brown while whipping an ax around like a bad kung fu movie hero and all the while questioning whether or not he should hold hands with Mary Todd.  There is no suspense in this lifeless, dull, and wandering piece of drivel.  There is nothing remotely scary about the movie.  The vampires are dull and stereotypical.  They have huge teeth and the effect has been seen previously in numerous films. They seem impotent for the most part and are too easily killed (Lincoln single handily dispatches with about 8 of the them at once!) The BIG SCENE in which Lincoln jumps from horse to horse during a stampede while he attempts to chop up a really bad vampire is silly.  It gives a bad name to CGI.  Save your time and money.  If you want a good vampire movie try 30 Days of Night.  It is a good scare (at least until the Hollywood ending).
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|The game as such is all about physics and very interesting but you have to figure out most functions by yourself, such as you can turn a building element by clicking on it while it is already in place.<br />At the sandbox level, it's hard to do without a mechanic.<br />It would be helpful if you could review the course as long as you want before starting it.
B005DC68NI|4.0|In truth, I was somewhat interested in this book, but I was afraid that<br />it would be boring.  It proved me wrong.  It is an insightful look into<br />the world of self-publishing and it even talks with actual authors who<br />have self-published.  I would recommend this for any up and coming author<br />to read.
B003PGNBO8|3.0|I would have given this series five stars but they never released the second season seperatly. I bought the first season when it was released then they decided to cancel this series and then released it as a complete series forgetting about all those suckers that bought the 1st release and waiting for the second that never came.  WHY would I want to pay top dollar for this complete series when I payed top dollar for the first season, I'd then have the 1st season twice, I DON'T NEED IT TWICE but would be willing to buy it again and own two copy's of the 1st season only if they made it cost worthy and not take me to the cleaners again !  other than that...  this was a very promissing tv series , it could have gone a few more seasons before burning out. If you haven't bought the 1st season then this is worth it, but for those of us who thought that if we got on the buy it band wagon now that we then would have told the networks that they had a keeper and to keep producing this show, But quess I was wrong,  I'll wait in the future before buying another brand new tv series until it has a succesful 2nd season with the third ready to air.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I own several bootleg versions of this concert; on DVD and video tapes.  Therefore, I ordered this DVD just to stay \\"complete.\\"  But, I was very impressed.  I almost felt like I hadn't seen it before.  Of course bootleg material is usually sub-standard, but I thought the most recent version was pretty darn good.  Turns out there was a lot of room for improvement, and this disc delivered.  Don't forget, the recording is from 30+ years ago, and it's not professionally filmed.  It was probably shot on the usual in-house video system.  So don't expect \\"Shine a Light\\" quality, but it's very good; all things considered.  This copy must have come right off the original video tapes. Super!
B005EGXNLS|4.0|This is the best novel in the Saxon Chronicles. I hope there`s another novel in the making telling the rest of Uthred`s story
B0083V2W6I|4.0|Music is not only the greatest thing over this movie. It is also a master piece of british culture over the 60´s reflecting the conflicts that young \\"mods\\" faced to \\"fit\\" on an all new society model. I saw it many years ago in a film festival when I was a young teenager. Finally I could see it back again, and even now that I am an adult, I still got that unique sense of seeking the essence of my human emotions and feelings.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was different than what I would normally read but because I had heard so much about it I wanted to see what everyone was talking about.  I must say I couldn't put it down and am now into the second one!
B000002LND|1.0|I have several complaints about this transaction. The first is that it took awhile for this item to ship/ arrive. My second complaint is that when it finally arrived the CD case was obviously not in new condition. It was not wrapped, the case was cracked and the CD itself turned out to be a knock off and not a very good one at that. The sound quality was awful...it sounded as if someone took a recorder and recorded the music from the radio and burned it to a CD. I wrote an email to the vendor and they apologized that the CD case was broken and said that it typically happens in transit and assured me that it was new and that I could send it back and they would issue me a new one. Did not feel like it was worth the cost/ effort.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|In his book Dr. Alexander's describes the experiences of, and surrounding, his Near Death Experience (NDE). His audience from the Prologue:<br />\\"I am especially eager to tell my story to the people who might have heard stories similar to mine before and wanted to believe them, but had not been able to fully do so.\\"<br /><br />I am not one of his intended audience since I'm very familiar with NDEs from Moody and others and belong to the scientific/mystic group. Scientific and Religious dogmatists (skeptics) will find no solace in his wonderful story.<br /><br />He tells his story simply and eloquently. I particularly enjoyed his observations about the difference between having/being an experience and being able to explain that experience to others. Kinda like stuffing a million pounds of sugar into a teaspoon. Or as a friend put: \\"You can know what you think, but you can't think what you know.\\" Thought as a symbolic representation in language is an experience, yet not the same as the originating experience.<br /><br />Additionally, at the end of Ch 28 Dr. Alexander writes:<br />\\"...I had been alive, and aware, truly aware, in a universe characterized above all by love, consciousness, and reality.\\"<br /><br />This \\"love, consciousness, and reality\\" is a restatement in his words of his experience of the ancient Sanskrit concept/experience of \\"Sat-Chit-Ananda\\": Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander, with his story, adds himself to a growing list of scientists who propound the truth of Science and Spirituality as two non-dichotomous aspects of the same reality.<br /><br />I do differ from him wrt \\"Evil\\", in the sense of my experience of: \\"All there is, is Love. If you are not experiencing Love, you are deluded.\\" Thus I see \\"Evil\\" merely as \\"Delusion\\", and, still another aspect of Love.<br /><br />For me, the last chapter held a special joy and beauty.<br /><br />Finally, thank you Dr. Alexander for sharing your magnificent story with the world. You, we, are the reason.<br /><br />Om Prema, Mahalo Nui Loa, and Aloha.. Al, are the reason.<br /><br />Om Prema, Mahalo Nui Loa, and Aloha.. Al
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I'm not sure which cable all these folks are talking about..but I bought this cable and it will not charge my Kindle Fire from my computer or my car's usb ports.  Actually the description never mentions charging...but the reviews do.<br /><br />My new car has a couple of usb ports and I was thinking I could charge my Kindle while I was driving....did not work. (even the auto charger that was sold for the Kindle doesn't charge it).  I've read on many forums that charging the Kindle Fire with anything but the AC adapter that came with it is troublesome.<br /><br />Still waiting to hear from Amazooo on this one...but I still love them and will keep buying from them...
B007VUA7VO|3.0|at first its great...but then after it gets announce because every time I plug my kindle in it exits and goes to this app.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|It isn't always easy to find a movie that is suitable for children and also interesting for adults.  This was one of the most enjoyable Family Movie Nights we have had.  The kids (ages 5 and 8) were squealing with laughter and the parents and grandparents were having a great time.<br /><br />For the adults, it was kind of bittersweet to watch the late Natasha Richardson, and a young, unspoiled Lindsay Lohan.  They are both so talented, but I think that knowing what has become of these two gifted actresses mitigated our enjoyment of the film.  I do hope to someday see Ms. Lohan get her life on track.<br /><br />I wish there were more movies like this one.  I have a feeling we'll have plenty of re-runs.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Love this type of music and definently worth a listen for anyone who like new age or techno music. Hear the main song on the TV show âLongmireâ; after that it seemed to appear everywhere. Itâs very catchy. Enjoy!
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Young adult women with and an overwhelming sense of entitlement who follow their patrician families to overseas diplomatic postings in the 1930's often found a freedom from convention not available in the home country. These days all this seems hopelessly quaint, and words like convention are meaningless in 2012. But if you are over 60, you actually recall a time when to be female was to be a person without choices in life. This book reminds me 'In The Garden Of Beasts' about William Dobbs and his daughter who were posted in Berlin at the same time as the family in this book.
B000002O1Q|5.0|I love 80âs soundtracks and this is a great addition to any collection. Saw this movie on tv and loved the music more than the movie itself. See the movie first and then get the soundtrack.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|It is the perfect gift for a child, original design, pretty colors, the material is a bit weak, allows that the children should amuse themselves
B0081BU42O|4.0|Not as enthralling as Excession or use of weapons, but an excellent space opera nonetheless. I would highly recommend for anyone interested in the culture series.
B0029XIWCY|5.0|Great collection.  I wish they'd have given technical info,  such as where the transfers were from, individual's copies or masters. Could have done without the article, \\"Literary Lady\\" and replaced with more info on the transfers.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|This guy is at the top of his game both musically and engineering wise. I'll forgo all the accolades of the music. If you like Lee and the last 10 years or so of his work you will like this. What I'm happiest about is that along with his last Blu Ray release \\"Overtime\\" the engineering / mix / sound is absolutely first rate. If you have the capability download the 96/24 or better version from HD Tracks. Stellar Sound!
B005FRF6PC|5.0|A must read if you're a Rafa fan ... or even just a tennis fan. Really loved the structure of the book - a chapter from Rafa, then a follow up from Carlin, with a look back into how Rafa grew into the player he is today. Provided a lot of insight into what makes Rafa tick, and what makes him such a force in tennis. With Rafa, Federer, Djokovic, and Murray now on the rise, it's quite an exciting time for tennis fans. Expect Rafa to win many more and can't wait for the second book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent series. I was so involved that when I finished \\"Wool\\" I  wanted more. Luckily, I was able to purchase \\"Wool Omnibus\\" for my Kindle immediately. The author, Hugh Howey, created a world that I want to know. Characters that were believable,flawed and compelling. I became so involved during a harrowing escape that I could not read fast enough..I recommend the series which is about a world that can be imagined clearly with the author's descriptive and entertaining writing.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is perhaps the best comic book movie ever made and an argument can be made that it is the best action movie ever made. It is exciting, funny and smart at the same time, a rare trifecta for anything put out by hollywood these days. The special edition has some fun extras including a blooper reel. Its a little excessive to include the DVD version along with the blue-ray, but since I don't have a blue-ray player on the laptop, I can just use it to watch the movie again while travelling.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|More fun and challenging than other match games. Nice graphics but tends to be a bit laggy. give it try, you wont be sorry.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen is a true master.   Her characters and phrasing linger long after the book has been set aside.  Austen should be required reading for all.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I loved all of this series it is the best series i have read in a long time. thank you.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|insightful, provocative and a wonderful rule of thumb for a well lived life! I can recommend this book to anyone who is seek meaning in their life and is open to alertante paths. Add reading to Honoring the Medicine to your book list if you like this one.<br />BTW All Ruiz books are worth reading and studying
B000L3CHC0|5.0|For years I've always been disdainful of super-expensive watches, when the logic is simply \\"why spend thousands of dollars on a Patek Phillipe or Rolex when a Casio will serve me just as well?\\"  As I closed on my 40th birthday, I began to research and found that good, sturdy watches can be found for far less than I thought.<br /><br />What sold me on this particular watch is the stark contrast of the yellow second hand on the black background (my team colours, no less!), which resembles the speedometer of a racing car, but still somehow maintains enough refinement so as to go well with a tuxedo.  Initially it feels heavy--like a serious watch should feel--but upon wearing it you appreciate the heft a lot more.  I opted for the stainless steel band merely as a personal preference (I don't care for leather bands, and I feel the steel is more secure), and you will need to clean it every so often, just like any watch.  The sapphire crystal means that you also won't be treating the watch like it's made of fine china or worrying about scratches or dings.<br /><br />I get a lot of compliments on the watch, and like most of the other reviewers have said, it looks and feels like it should cost much more than it actually does, but you don't sacrifice quality.  It's a man's watch but my wife absolutely loves it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This has to be one of the most disappointing books I've ever read.  I had it on my Kindle and have to say that if it had been an actual book, it would have finished up on the other side of the room after the first few chapters!  There is no doubt in my mind that it will suit the likes of the frustrated and dirty old men on this planet but give me an interesting and gripping storyline......something to get my teeth into.  (forgive the pun!!)
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Did not watch the series. Saying that did not regret purchasing this movie. Enjoyed watching it with the family. Hope you enjoy it also.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|You could not ask for a better reboot than Casino Royale with regards to the 007 collection. Daniel Craig and Judie Dench make this Bond movie \\"not another Bond movie\\". It's refreshing, more realistic, and the most suspenseful of all the 007 movies preceding it. It starts as a time capture of Bond's earning his license to kill. Throughout the movie M (Dench) has some doubts about whether it was too early for Bond to receive 007 status. It is the only Bond movie that ends with an obvious hint that the story continues in a next movie. The Solace being a secretive organization representing Mr. White and LeChiffre will keep this movie train going for years to come. The acting is riveting. When Bond and LeChiffre are at the table there is a period of silence. However, the looks and the body language speak volumes. It is so intense. As for the Vesper Martini? Love it. I can't find a bartender in the Chicago area mind you that knows how to make one. This is the only Bond movie I have seen as well as the \\"Quantum of Solace\\" more than three times. I find new things in it as well as the beauty of the Italian Riviera throughout the movie. Daniel Craig is a phenominal actor and reinvents the Bond character. Even the music rocks \\"literally\\" as sung by ex-Soundgarden Chris Cornell.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|This tells a lot about life as a musician; however, more than that he intersperses stories about other celebrities.  He had a rough childhood, but I think for the most part he is together now.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I've very glad that this book was written.  An objective reporting of all the details needed to be done.  Easy reading, good story telling.
0316228532|2.0|By the end of the first 20 pages, I still didn't really care about any of the characters.  That's an enormous minus for this book.  There was too much information given about too many characters, and not enough reason for me to wonder what happens to them.  I simply didn't LIKE any of them.  Yes, I finished the book but when my Kindle died halfway through and I had to wait a week for a replacement, I didn't miss Casual Vacancy at all!  I think that says a lot.  Yes, the ending is thought-provoking, but it's no much work - work, not pleasure - to get through this book.
B003U4XP1E|5.0|Does tbhis really need my review?  I think nott. I do not think there woul be anything i can say to either make or prevent people from purchasing this tv series.
B008B3EQPI|5.0|amazing album all in all. well blended genres and energetic. i just dont have any more time to review it.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Ms. Rowling is still my idol.  This book is impossible to put down.  The small English village life is so spot on and her characters are so believeable that I felt like a fly on the wall. Imagine Peton Place in 2012 in an English village but with a much better plot. Lovely, lovely, lovely story.  I would have to tell the whole plot if I started describing the story.  READ IT!  LOVE IT!  Pass it on to all your friends.  It's on my Kindle so that I can read it over and over again.<br />A. June Mackie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game every day. I play it a few times daily. It's relaxing to me! I will keep on playing!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This was such a fun movie. It's a sweet, nostalgic, and offbeat flick with an all-star cast. If you're looking for a feel-good experience, this is the movie for you. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app and has not caused any problems.  I really like the report that can be swiped down from the top even when you are doing something else.
0316228532|1.0|I did read to the end, but things never got better.  If you like unrelieved death, despair  and disappointment here you go.
B008XG1X18|4.0|such a great app! it is very addicting but very helpful. I love that all my ideas are saved in one place
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This series has been a fun read for my spouse and I, although not the best writing around I was caught up in the story and the characters. Believable? Not really, but how much of modern romance literature is believable. The sexual relationship is quite enjoyable however and explains the huge popularity of the novels. Mainstream porn, finally.
1558908846|5.0|Movie came a day early and watched it right when I got I in the mail. Really fun light hearted movie to watch.
B004QX07G4|1.0|The sample of this book made me laugh, but I was so surprised to see that the rest of the book was a bit of a rambling mess. I figured there would be some sort of linear fashion it would flow through, but it seemed to be a collection of random thoughts slapped together in a haphazard manner. The biggest bummer is that Ellen is usually so funny - with a little guidance & structure, peppered with additional funny chapters like \\"Covergirl\\" this may have been a decent read.
1476712042|5.0|Okay so I have to admit I was worried I was not going to end up liking the book and I was right. I don't like it, I LOVE IT!!! It's like a breathe of fresh air considering it is not your typical love story, it has so much reality to it. Sometimes you simply can't fight against the person you love from the very first moment you saw them. Amazing book, I have not read such an addicting book in a long time! Honestly, people READ THIS BOOK you will not regret it at all. Promise :)
B0048LPRD2|5.0|This is one of those movies that after you watch it, you can't get the images out of your head.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|My six year old son and I saw this movie together and we both loved it!! This is an amazing story especially for a mother and her children. He is very adverse to anything that might be \\"girly\\" and Merida is such a tomboy that he didnt even think of it as to girly for him at all. I already have this movie preordered and am counting down the days until it ships!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Best superhero movie ever love the hulk and iron man in this movie well made can't wait for part 2.
0062193929|4.0|This was a gift from my sister, very good audio book. Love to hear Patti Smith read, it's a joy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book when I was a teenager, and was so happy it was available on Kindle. I bought it so I could read it again before the movie came out and it was just ad good as I remembered!
1476715904|4.0|This was a very cute, nice, sad, and sweet book to read.  I read it in 1.5 days.  It is a easy read. I felt every pain that Will and Lake felt with the lost of their parents. I did feel like their feelings for each other was a little rushed. They were in love with each other within 3 days of meeting each other. The brothers didnt act like a typical 9 year olds. They seemed a little younger like maybe 5. I have a 9 year old stepson and he doesnt act or talk like Caulder or Kel in this book. Maybe mine is just very mature for his age. IDK.  I did fall in love with reading the poetry in this book.  It has somewhat inspired me to write poetry when I find it hard to express my feelings. That is what made me really love this book. You can say so much in a few words of poetry.  I loved every single one including the one Lake wrote called MEAN.  That had me cracking up. The one thing that frustrated me the most in the book was how Lake responded to finding out her mother's illness.  She wasnt so much precious time being mad at her mother like it was her fault for being sick.  She ran to Will instead of being there for her mother(in the beginning).  Other than that.  I loved this book and would recommend it to others.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The Mahjong deluxe game [ASIN:B004DWEL0Q Mahjong Solitaire] is challenging and a delight to play.  Because there are many variations of the game, it makes playing the sets interesting and even playing the same sets are a fun challenge to see if I can play the set faster or more effeciently.
B008NABUU8|5.0|fun little game that keeps u thinking and I am very addicted I need 8 more words to submit this
B00899DR40|5.0|Excellent growth from beginning and amazing vocals. Awesome album For everyone. I love every song on the album especially fall!!
B0041D843M|5.0|I was astounded by the facts presented in this book. I had suspected a lot of it but never had the proof to back it up.<br />I could not read it and not take action. I changed my eating habits because of this book and I feel so much better, physically and emotionally.<br />I have more energy and a clearer mind. I highly recommend it.
B000002GY9|5.0|Excellent artistic quality cd and beautifully written. I recommend to all. This cd needs to be well reproduced from an audio quality first, so its technical qualities are demonstrated.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Its a good game but I was a little upset when my friend and I were on turn 302 and I drew a tractor and when it got to her she didn't have any of the right letters. and when she gave up, it said right after the word was tractor. On my kindle fire the game may glitches pretty frequently so just be careful of that. otherwise a great game!
B008XG1X18|4.0|works great on the kindle fire.  beats using the web.  much faster n easier to choose which board to pin items to.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|All of the male Avengers were marvelous, but the role of Black Widow was that of a woman agent with a pop gun. She was reminiscent of the old Cold War KGB. Her role was truly disappointing. She did get bad and pop back at the enemy, like a woman gangsta' character in a badly produced rap song. If you omit her Avenger character tis' one great film I'll say. Maybe someday Microsoft will create custom movie industry software to do just that. ha ha ha...
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Charlton Heston. He was larger than life.<br />Standing over 6 feet, and broad enough to match, with chiseled features and a chin Bruce Campbell would envy, Charlton's gravelly voice and intense charisma all added up to a man born to play characters larger than life: Moses, Ben-Hur, George Taylor, and, of course, El Cid.<br /><br />And what a performance he puts on!<br /><br />The word epic is the most misused word in the English language. On social media sites, and especially Youtube, ignorant people use \\"epic\\" to refer to anything that remotely amuses them or is considered out of the ordinary. That is not the true meaning of epic. Epic means \\"heroic; majestic; impressively great\\", epic means The Ten Commandments, Lawrence of Arabia, and War and Peace.<br /><br />Epic means El Cid.<br /><br />Have you ever seen a good battle scene in film? The Battle for Hoth in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Aqaba in Lawrence of Arabia, The Battle of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers? You haven't seen anything until you've seen El Cid. Tens of thousands of extras, hundreds of horses, countless swords, huge siege engines, giant castles.<br />All right here!<br /><br />What a sweeping spectacle El Cid is! Back when there were ACTUAL epics. Not CGI. Everything you see on the screen: giant battles, deadly jousts, tragic romance, giant castles, and amazing actors. Are all right there.<br /><br />5 Stars. Strongest Recommendation!!
B0049VZ222|5.0|We discovered AMC's hit show \\"The Walking Dead\\" midway through season 2. Let's just say the show has been great from the beginning. Don't miss it.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Steven Spielberg always watches four films before he directs a movie: [[ASIN:B000SOYEQY Lawrence Of Arabia]], [[ASIN:B004D1CK32 Seven Samurai]], [[ASIN:B001M432XA It's A Wonderful Life]], and The Searchers.<br /><br />The Searchers is arguably the greatest collaboration between The Duke and John Ford. When David Lean shot his masterpiece \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" he watched The Searchers because he thought that the cinematography was the best in any film.<br /><br />And he was probably right. Never have I been in so much awe staring at vast desert landscapes and canyons and rivers as in The Searchers. Never has there been a character in a western so compelling as Wayne's Ethan Edwards.<br />Never has anyone equaled the action, the acting, the heart, the suspense, or the drama of The Searchers.<br /><br />It is truly one of the greatest Westerns, no, one of the greatest FILMS of American cinema.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation!
B007THA4FI|4.0|It was a shift from young adult to really adult reading for Rowling. It was well written and a sad story.

159562015X|5.0|In StrengthsFinder 2.0, Tom Rath of Gallup seeks to show how we can identify our strengths and capitalize on them instead of focusing too much on our weaknesses. Using highly researched assessments, the book provides hundreds of techniques of that we can use to maximize our strengths and capabilities.<br /><br />I was particularly pleased by how this book was organized; making it easy to identify your top strengthens. I find that the tests were thoroughly accurate and the revelations about my strengths have really helped me to focus on leveraging those strengths. I also like the fact that the online assessments focus less about your weakness and more on your capacity. You can actually determine the kind of people you are better collaborating with and you can even know how other personalities will react to your capacities.<br /><br />Rath uses the formula Talent multiplied by Investment is equal to Strength. This goes to show that by investing in your talent and skill areas, you will be able to bring out your strengths. I highly recommend this book to managers, educationists, entrepreneurs and anyone looking to determine what their strengths, the type of people they would work best with and thus move ahead to profit from these strengths

0307730697|5.0|I loved this book.  I am inspired by the story of Adam's life and what he overcame.  I have a lot people who are hooked on drugs in my life and have the attitude \\"Once a druggy, always a druggy.\\".  The life of Adam Brown proves this is simply not true.  You can break free from it.  You can have the life you dream of.  You can get out of the pit you feel is inescapable.  Through the gospel of Jesus Christ anything is possible especially changing yourself.  That is what repentance and coming to Jesus Christ is all about, putting off the natural man and changing.<br />Not only did Adam overcome and spiritual and mental trials, but the physical trials he overcame were outstanding.  He proves that the human spirit, the desire to not only succeed but to excel despite physical handicaps is possible.  I personally believed I would have threw in the towel if i was dealt with what Adam was dealt with.  But he pressed on.  He pushed the limits on what is possible if you have the desire and faith to succeed.
0316228532|4.0|I am not entirely done reading this book, but I am more than half way through it. I think it is fabulous. It is multiple families stories all in one book. Some families lives are more boring than others. But I think the book is amazing. The writing is phenomenal, and the stories seem so real.<br />Many people are disappointed by this J.K. Rowling for this book, but not me! I hope she does more adult books, but maybe with just more fantasy/mystery/excitement!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read The Giver over 10 years ago when I was teaching middle school. I was pleased to learn that there are 3 other books in the series. Now my own children are middle school age and enjoying them!
0060557818|5.0|This book is outstanding. The writing is amazing, the story is amazing, and the fantasy is amazing. I have read this book about three times now and have never gotten bored with it. This is by far one of my top 5 favorite books. Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer and the things he imagines bewilders me! I hope he will one day write something like this!<br />There needs to be more books like this in the world!

B008XNZMOU|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1FYKXDIHV6YA0]]I bought Taylor Swift's new CD \\"Red\\" as a gift for my daughter two days ago and received it on time via Amazon Prime, but not only had it been opened (seal broke and plastic removed), the case was broken in many pieces.  The gift note was folded sloppily and not much regard for it being a gift.  I am very displeased with this purchase and would think Amazon would do a better job at packing and making certain a GIFT was unopened and in excellent condition. Was this even a new item?  Very unhappy!
0307592731|5.0|I read this on my Kindle after my sister-in-law called me telling me she just read it and I just had to read it! My friend went on a hike with her daughters with similar things as in the book happening with her hiking boots so I knew she had to read it too (also her daughters). I bought it for her.  I loved this book even though I'm not a hiker. It was well written and a very good read. Interesting.
0316228532|2.0|I'm a big Harry Potter fan.  Okay, so that out of the way, I was obviously looking forward to seeing what J.K. Rowling would do with her first post-Potter book, 2012's The Casual Vacancy.  In her new novel, Rowling displays her usual ability to build deep characters and intricate plots.  Unfortunately, all the characters are so dreary, being pitiful, a jerk, or a pitiful jerk, and and the plot so full of life-at-it's-smallest drama that you feel beaten down by the end.  Maybe that's what she's was going for.<br /><br />First off, there's a large, large cast, with a lot of complicated relationships.  That's fine.  Large casts don't bother me.  But I did feel like it took me half the novel just to finally keep straight who everyone was, and meanwhile, the plot was moving very, very slowly.  And the characters themselves, as I described above, are just so hard to care about.  There's no protagonist, it's a definite ensemble book, and no one is entirely on the right side of anything.  Rowling appears to be trying to put as many flaws as she can into the cast, and it becomes depressing.  Everyone has some terrible thing that's happened to them in their life that has scarred them.  At the same time, everyone is horrible to at least one other person in town.  Just when you feel sorry for someone about the first angle, they go and screw over someone else to fulfill the second.<br /><br />Are the characters interesting?  Yes.  Do I like any of them?  Not really.  Are some of them sort of understandable in why they do what they do.  Yes, but I still don't like them.  And then there are a few who seem to be unremitted jerks.  Simon Price has no redeeming features, doing nothing but committing theft and beating his family.  Maybe he was abused as a child, too, and Rowling forgot to mention it.  And then there's my absolute least favorite character, Stuart \\"Fats\\" Wall, the teenager who seems to be trying to take his Holden Caulfield impersonation up to \\"11.\\"  Since I didn't care for Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, this didn't do much for me.  And he and his quest for \\"authenticity\\" leave a path of destruction in his wake that screws up the life of just about anyone who ever so much as has been in the same room with him.<br /><br />The plot is divided into two main threads, with a lot of smaller threads going on alongside and weaving through them.  First is the politicking for the vacant council seat, which is just so petty and horrible that it's depressing.  The other is the \\"wrong part of town\\" Weedon family. They're also depressing, but at least the miserableness of their lives truly is misery.  The Weedons are the horrors of drugs, poverty, and social apathy writ large.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a tough book to like.  Rowling has certainly produced a well-written book, but I just can't get past how small, petty, depressing, and dreary the world it depicts is.  I kept wishing there was someone, anyone, I could root for, instead of feeling like I watching dozens of slow-motion train wrecks.  I think, overall, Rowling has done what she set out to do in The Casual Vacancy, but it just isn't a book I can really recommend to anyone who's enjoyed her other work.  If you like books about the small dramas of modern life, this will be just your thing, but unfortunately, I'm not in that category.for Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, this didn't do much for me.

B003DZX44I|5.0|My three year old daughter has been a little Beauty and the Beast obsessed lately.  When she wasn't feeling well one Saturday my husband and I finally caved and ordered her the movie (until then she had only read the book).  We watched it with her the following Tuesday and she was elated!  A few parts were a bit too much for a three year old (some of the scenes with Gaston, the Beast), but she watched most of it without getting scared, which is saying a lot as she is a VERY nervous movie-watcher.  My husband and I enjoyed watching it again and introducing it to our little girl.  I have a feeling it will become a favorite!
B008DVJO8C|1.0|If you're a true metal head stay far from this band and this album..ive been a fan of them for years and this album seals their fate. Its terribly oversexed and the lyrical content is immature and substance lacking. Their first album is great...and every one after steadily declines further to radio rock / mall metal fame. They've sold themselves out to the mainstream tern rock hoards. Maria disrespects herself as a gimmick for this band and her outfits have grown more and more provocative as the years have passed. If you're looking for a great female fronted band that is truely metal try Kittie...truely hard working..no gimmicks..solid discography!

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this app a lot but it does get frustrating running out of coins and having to wait so long for more.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Before reading this series I wondered what was all the hupla. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did it have the obvious content, but it also had suspense and even humor. I read each book within a week. I used to be an avid reader, now I am wanting to start reading again.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|Its not to long and not too short its just the story line isnt really well constructed. You get the goth or creepy feeling from like all Tim Burtons films yet the movie wasnt that funny and in most of the other films Tim does a good job showing the development of the characters and their feelings in this one its more choppy.
0545128285|5.0|Since I heard about this book in he Harry Potter books then heard the character Hermione Granger read a passage out of it, I wanted a copy if the book for myself. I really liked the fact that the version that I have has an introduction and side notes from Professor Dumbledore I knew that I couldn't put it down and I am reading it to my grand daughter. I recommend this book to the true Harry Potter fan it is a good read.

B000FC0V3E|1.0|chose this expecting to be blown away, cannot see why it rates as a classic.  Kept reading to see if it would get interesting. Along the same lines of Great Gatsby, perhaps it rates as a study of the attititudes of the times, but not entertaining. Will read others by this author as I search to find the real gems.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|We loved it so we sent a copy to the married son/daughter-in-law/kids. They had never heard of this happening and they live in Alaska! They also said it was a keeper. the little ones will ask to watch this one a few more times at least as time goes on.

B0035S996U|5.0|This movie was awesome. The action scenes were great and were performed very well by the cast . Can U Dig It?
0143038419|5.0|I LOVED this book! The book really opens ones perspective on life. As Americans, many of us are lead by our culture to believe that success means getting married, make lots of money, buy fancy house and pop out lots of kids. Elizabeth Gilbert addresses a different perspective on life, the wanderlust! I related to this book because I have never had dreams about getting married and living happily ever after. My dreams have been about exploring the world and exploring my inner self.<br /><br />Shortly after I read this book I was offered a job in Germany. I moved overseas and stayed in Germany for two years. During my stay in Europe, I traveled extensively across the continent as a solo woman. Eat, Pray, Love really empowered me to travel alone!
B00920HMNM|5.0|As a solo artist, Steely Dan frontman Donald Fagen has amassed a great body of work- even if he wasn't as profilic as his counterparts in the rock world. Throughout his 30 year solo career, Fagen has recorded only four solo albums. The first of which was the stunning \\"The Nightfly\\" followed by the concept album \\"Kamakiriad\\". He linked up with his former partner Walter Becker to reform Steely Dan and released the 2000 Grammy winning for Album Of The Year \\"Two Against Nature\\". Three years later, they released what many people viewed as their swan song, \\"Everything Must Go\\". In 2006, Donald resumed his solo career with the death driven concept album \\"Morph The Cat\\". After six years of laying low, he returned with his new album in 2012- the surprisingly upbeat \\"Sunken Condos\\".<br /><br />On his new album, Donald produces the record with Michael Leonhart- a session musician that worked with Donald on his previous record as well as the last two Steely Dan albums. This time around, Donald gets funky and decides to lighten things up a little bit. He struts around town with a much younger woman on the James Brown inspired \\"Slinky Thing\\". He rejoices being a better person after a bad breakup on \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" and admires the collection of antiques on \\"Memorabilia\\". He sings of being heartbroken on the blues influenced \\"Weather In My Head\\". Donald steps back into his trademark snarky attitude on \\"The New Breed\\", where he ridicules his ex as well as her new flame. For the second time in his solo career, Donald does a cover song. This time, it's Issac Hayes' song \\"Out Of The Ghetto\\"- a song in which Donald sings of a woman who has seemingly changed her ways...at least until alcohol and the nightlife comes into the picture. He recalls memories of a regular bowler on \\"Miss Marlene\\" and closes the album with the song about an energetic woman \\"Planet D'Rhonda\\". Overall, Donald Fagen's \\"Sunken Condos\\" is yet another great album from the legendary musician. This album is a clear contender for being the album of the year- it's just that good.is a clear contender for being the album of the year- it's just that good.
1608871517|5.0|Dressing Michael Jackson is quite the coffee table book, so sumptious you just want to eat up each and every page. But what you don't expect are for the pages to sing with a beautifully told story that is as much about integrity and friendship and loyalty as it is about the iconic style of a brilliant artist and the key players behind the smoke and mirrors of fame. Intelligent and visceral, a yummy must-read; an elegant statement of literary design.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Just like tetris, but having to use a little brain power when playing. It's pretty easy at first, but does get faster like tetris. Decent way to pass the time, but not all the addictive, won't be playing for long stretches at a time.
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|I ordered this controller back in September.  I've been looking for a compact controller for use with my android phone for a very long time.  At first this looked amazing.  From the screen shots it's just the right size, small yet sturdy, and several youtube videos show just how easy pairing this playpad with your android 3.0 and higher device is.  All of this made the product look very attractive.<br /><br />Well, I just received it today.  It comes in a nice plastic case and looks very nice, but it's much smaller than it appears(not a deal breaker but takes some getting used to).  The slider sticks remind me of the Nintendo DS or PSP nub(only of lower quality).  The real problem I have with this playpad is that it doesn't work.  It charges and turns on, but once paired it refuses to connect properly with any of my devices.  I've tried it with my wife's tablet, two phones(one running 3.2 the other a custom 2.3.5 rom) and even my laptop.  With the exception of my laptop none of these devices were able to connect with the playpad.  When my laptop did connect it failed to register ANY button presses on the playpad.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't waste your money.  Wait for a better product.  I really wanted to like it, but right now it just doesn't work.<br /><br />I'm going to let the playpad charge overnight and see it improves.  I'll update this review if anything changes.<br /><br />______________________________<br />EDIT: After charging overnight the Playpad finally connected with my phone.  In my excitement I immediately launched my favorite emulators and games only to find that none supported the controller, and even with supposedly supported apps(mentioned on the box and Nyko's website) the controller had limited functionality(I have yet to find the game that acknowledges the triggers, or even the face buttons for that matter).  Undaunted by this I downloaded Nyko's Playground(BETA).  This was a mistake.<br /><br />  Nyko's Playground isn't a BETA it's an Alpha.  It has very little functionality and when installed it nullifies other installed non-standard keyboards(playground works by creating a virtual keyboard and assigning Playpad buttons to it.  In theory you should be able to switch between these on the fly, like any other keyboard, but Nyko's app is just full of quirky bugs and somehow disabled this on three different devices, our two phones and my wife's tablet.).  To make matters worse the Playground app NEVER closes.  Even with a force close it launches itself and remains in the background.  I've installed the app multiple times in the hope that something might have gone wrong.  It didn't.  The App simply doesn't work.  And because the Playpad has almost no functionality without the Playground app installed(Outside of acting as an oddly shaped mouse.  I will say this, the mouse setting worked flawlessly on all devices.)the Playpad doesn't work.<br /><br />Revised Bottom Line: It's clear that Nyko wasn't ready to launch this device.  Which is a shame, it really has a lot of potential, but wait until Nyko gets it working.  I know they were in a hurry( there are other bluetooth controllers launching in the near future, including the likely superior Steel Series Free Mobile Controller.), but that's no excuse.<br /><br />In response to the comments: I'm glad the Playpad worked for some of you, however it hasn't worked for me and I doubt I'll be a special case.  Maybe my Playpad was defective but I think it more likely suffers from being a working prototype pushed to market far too early.  It's not uncomfortable after you adjust to the size and shape, but the nubs feel cheap and have a smooth plastic finish around the edges that causes them to slip around your thumbs in normal use.  There is a lot good(the portability is amazing and the case really was designed with a 'throw it in your pocket and game on the go' attitude), but there is more bad and when coupled with the fact that the device is hit or miss in its usability, it's hard to recommend.
0761163808|5.0|About 15 years ago at the Annual Toy Fair in New York I first saw some hanging mobiles using a technology called scanimation where the revolving image would appear to move. They were new clever but basically black and white images on a translucent piece of plastic. There is a book called \\"Gallop\\" that was published including a few of these.<br /><br />At this year's Book Expo (in May) I spotted this new book - \\"Safari\\" - that appeared to use the same technology. A closer look at the mock-up (it only had the cover image at that time) showed me that technology has really advanced and a new photo technology, called Photicular Technology, allows full color motion when the pages are moved. I was told the book would be \\"something special\\" and it is! Inventor and photo artist Dan Kainan has produced eight images - each of a different wild animal (Lion, Gorilla, Rhinoceros, Zebra, Elephant, Gazelle, and Giraffe- and the 4x6 images are accompanied by a page of text from National Geographic photographer Carol Kaufman.<br /><br />It's a beautiful and educational book you can share with your kids (but be aware that it is not sturdily bound so it will need tender treatment. Put this book on a table when you have company and watch everyone's face when they pick it up and open to the first image page!<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

Amazon is once again literally turning down customer money!<br /><br />Sure, I put in a \\"let me know when it's also out on Blu-ray\\" request for it awhile back, but heard nothing. Why bother releasing it in plain def, without a Blu-ray choice as well?<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory situation, among others, seems to have it together - both a regular and Blu-ray has always already been available at the same time for all their seasons. So why not The New Girl?

B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have read all of Jo Nesbo's books and found this to be the best yet.  Lots of twists and turns to the plot, very believable.

I did think he did a great job of making the characters believable and sympathetic.

B0084I9QI2|5.0|This is one of the best anniversary re-releases EVER done. The original BAD album has been beautifully re-mastered. The extra bonus tracks are great to have. But the PRIZE of the box-set is the OFFICIAL release of Jackson's BAD concert on DVD and CD. The DVD performance is just AMAZING. Its fun to see a very young Sheryl Crowe singing with Jackson(YES...she was a back-up singer before she got famous)! I wish other artists would take a clue from this collection: if you are gonna release a live audio CD with a concert DVD, then release THE ENTIRE AUDIO of the concert, not just selected cuts from the show. I wished this set had included another DVD featuring all the videos from the BAD album (that DVD is a bonus DVD if you buy just the CD at TARGET). Oh Well. If you are a DIE-HARD Jackson fan, GET THIS! If you loved the 80's, GET THIS!! If you are a fan of GREAT POP MUSIC, GET THIS NOW!!! You will THANK yourself for years to come!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have been awaiting this book's publication for months and I just finished reading it, and couldn't get back to amazon to give my 5 stars.  I am an avid reader, but this is my first comment on Amazon, the reasoning for this is that I fully want to support the message of this book. I am glad I can read a well written book on NDE from a direct experiencer who can intelligently explain this amazing phenomenon to simple folks like me.  I am interested in spirituality, my place here on earth, and the mystery of the universal force, but I want to understand the truth from a spiritual and intellectual place without any materialistic religious dogma attached to it.  NDE's like Dr. Eben Alexander do this for me.  There is authenticity in his experience, you only have to watch his video on the Bioethics forum to see that (which got me interested in his book in the first place).  Obviously reading a book can never be the same as experiencing the majesty of what he experienced, but he encourages you to explore it on your own if you are invested in such an exploration.<br /><br />In critique of his book many (online publications) have focused sarcastically on the butterflies and orbs as angels, etc.  To me descriptions like these point to the fact that he is stating his experience authentically as he experienced it, not as he should have to be more palatable to the so called \\"skeptics\\" and intellectual community. Reality of a blind person is different that the reality of a person who can see and experience the grandness of this earth.  Similarly, Dr. Alexander has experienced another type of grand reality that is a real, but because most of the human population is \\"blind\\" to this reality (including me), we choose to deny its existence even when it's as real as earthly reality.  And when someone like the author points to this reality, we choose to attack him and his body of work with sarcasm instead of authentic skepticism and inquiry.<br /><br />Simply, what I love about a booklike this is that his experience is authenticating that neither the material reality (I believe it if I see it and prove it) espoused by the scientific community is 100% correct neither the religious bodies' material-spritualistic view (My way is the only way) correct.  There is a third way which values both the temporal material existence of the body and timeless spiritual existence of the self, and this reality is personal as each NDEer experiences his own unique reality in this other realm.<br /><br />One-time read to grasp the concepts is not enough, I will be re-reading this book.  I am appreciate Dr. Alexander's efforts to bring this book to us and the courage it takes to do so.  I am glad the universe choose such a perfect subject for exploration of this truth and I am glad a major publication house picked it up to give it further credence.  I can feel his struggle to explain what he experienced with limited language at his disposal, can you imagine reading a translated book or watching a foreign movie with subtitles - so much is lost in translation- that's why I appreciate this author's efforts.<br /><br /> In my personal critique of the book, I have to say that discourse with God \\"Om\\" could have been explained in more detail- it leaves one wanting for more or not fully satisfied.  More details were needed, as Dr. Alexander pointed out that much was explained to him in this realm- well that doesn't come forth in the book.  So, I have agree with others who reviewed the book that it's \\"good but lacking\\".  Also I think the possible arguments listed at the end for why this was an NDE not a brain produced phenomenon, the book should have gone into it  with supporting evidence to make it into a more complete case for NDE and put forth a good argument for the skeptics.

B005IGZUTC|5.0|I adore Lindsey Kelk's novels and I Heart Vegas is no exception. In fact, it might even have vaulted into my favourite of the I Heart Series. Full of Vegas drama in typical Angela style, I laughed out loud and even shed a few tears with this one right along with Angela's ups and downs.<br /><br />Angela Clark is back with all her antics, insecurities and amusing decisions. For some reason, her plight in I Heart Vegas felt the most real to me - perhaps why I connected with this novel the most. I could understand the reasons why she didn't want to bring up the subject with Alex and why she didn't want the outcome her friends were pushing on her, although I could see their point too. I also loved the revisit to Vegas, which I've travelled to once before and enjoyed reliving it, albeit not quite at the same intoxicated pace and emotional duress that Angela explored it from, but I loved reading about her adventures there.<br /><br />Angela's internal dialogue and predicaments are as amusing as ever. I've said it my last two reviews of Kelk's I Heart series before, but I'll repeat in case you haven't *gasp* read them yet - I love that in these novels the heroine already has a boyfriend and isn't just searching for love but instead they explores their relationship. There are few novels like this - Many are either; single and searching, boyfriend pre breakup or married and managing.<br /><br />I loved the unpredictability of I Heart Vegas. Kelk dragged it out mercilessly and I wasn't quite sure how the end of would play out even though I thought I did from the beginning. Kelk convinced me that what I had anticipated wasn't going to occur after all and with already knowing the title of the next novel, I was bamboozled right up until the end about which way things were going to go both with her life and love.<br /><br />I suspect this novel would stand alone well if you didn't want to read all the novels in the series, but why would you want to do that? And if you're already an Angela fan, you definitely won't be disappointed!  I can't wait for the next one in the series now!  Bring on London !  And I only have to wait a few more months!  SQUEE!<br /><br />Thank you to HarperCollins Canada for our review copy! All opinions are our own!an Angela fan, you definitely won't be disappointed!

I have never laughed so hard in my life...this book makes me very happy!<br />  I bought Underwater Dogs after I happened to find Seth Casteel and his facebook page online. I look forward to each and every post so I knew I HAD to have his book.<br />  I have been sharing this book with my students at school. I enjoy their reactions to each photo whether they laugh or pretend to be scared. I've used the book to point out that good books do not always need to use words to tell a story.<br />  I highly recommend this book for any one...not just dog lovers. The quality of the photos is outstanding. Seth Casteel is a very talented photographer and it amazes me how he is able to capture each dog's personality in each of his photos.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|awesome app! use it every day and have never had an issue with it! highly reccomended! Nice to see how much life my kindle has left.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It is great and you definitely do NOT have to be a boy to enjoy it (often my experience when the protagonist is male).  It is really one of those books that you can't stop reading and are just so sad when it is over.  I read it about 6 months ago and I STILL miss it!  Great book.  If you like this book, or the dystopian genre in general, you will also love WOOL by Hugh Howey.  [[ASIN:1469984202 Wool - Omnibus Edition]].  It is also in my top five and just GREAT.  Disturbing without giving you nightmares, can't put it down, miss it when it is over type of book.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|If you have read and enjoyed any of the other Percy Jackson books then you will surely enjoy this one. It was another book that once I started it I had to finish it and am now hungry for more.  If you have not read the other two books from the series, I strongly suggest you read those first.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is fun for everyone! I play this with my 50 y/o parents and the 5 y/o I babysit. Whenever I have a spare twenty minutes I grab this out of my bag and play with coworkers, friends, classmates, and even a professor or two. This game is very easy to learn, and highly fun. I have had games last from 2 minutes to an hour, it all depends on the luck of the dice. I've only won a few games, but it's fun no matter who wins, as everyone has a blast betting on dice and cursing the sky when they get 3 shotguns. I would recommend this to anyone who likes quick easy games that have a lot of replay value.

B0060ZJ74O|5.0|After watching this movie, I am practically speechless; I kept waiting for it to come down, but it was always kinda high, to me; I wondered to myself \\"What's the big deal? Or: Why is the price not dropping?\\", even on a used DVD. I have to say: If you like baseball or sports in general, This is an amazing movie. Brad Pitt is outstanding in this movie, as well as the entire cast. It may well be one of my favorite all-time movies, and I have many, many favorites; I keep putting the DVD back in, and watching parts of the movie, over and over, when I have a couple of hours to spend; It is a 2 hour+ movie, but worth the investment of time. Thanks to Brad Pitt for his flawless performance, and to Billy Beane, for an outstanding professional effort, year after year, and Kerris Dorsey, for the song she sings and the portrayal of a loving daughter. Pure Magic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! The only regret I have is not reading it sooner!!! No words can best describe how great this book is.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|\\"Bones Are Forever\\" by Kathy Reichs in the latest in her Temporance Brennan series about a forensic anthropologist who solves crimes.  In this one she is working in Canada and is trying to solve the case of the woman leaving dead babies all over Canada like some sort of morbid Hensel and Gretal.  I don't read the Brennan books in order so I haven't figured out why she sometimes works in the US and sometimes works in Canada.  But, anywho, she's in Canada.  The trail of dead babies leads her to the severe North of Canada where the baby trail leads to a drug/prostitution ring and a diamond mining saga.<br />My opinion of this one is that, though all of the Brennan I have read thus far are great, this one is not as great as the others.  She gets very technical about not only bones and forensics, but also diamond mining.  Probably a little too technical.  I kind of gazed over some on it.  However, the baby story line is incredibly intriguing without being more than one can handle reading.  It also has lots of action and even a little humor.  Definitely worth the read.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|This is the most important book you will read this year. Let me repeat that, this is the most important book that you will read this year and here's why, it outlines just how through innovation and new product development the world is about the change. It's pretty common knowledge that innovation especially in this country is the key to our recovery and automation is the key to new product introductions.<br />From the book:<br />\\"Automation is here to stay-it's the only way that large-scale manufacturing can work in rich countries. But what can change is the role of smaller companies. Just as start-ups are the driver of innovation in the technology world and the underground is the driver of ne culture, so, too, can the energy and creativity of entrepreneurs and individual innovators reinvent manufacturing and create jobs along the way...The great opportunity in the new Maker Movement is the ability to be both local and global. Both artisanal and innovative. Both high tech and low-cost. Starting small and growing big, and most of all creating the sort of products that the world wants bit doesn't know it yet, because those products don't fit neatly into the mass economics of the old model.<br />Anderson spends a lot of time talking about how new products are being developed and how they are being built using everything from now affordable 3D printers to using companies that can built the new products for the innovators including helping them with engineering, design, fabrication and assembly of the new products all in the small quantities required for product development and leading to mass production when the product takes off.<br />By using companies who are offering integrated solution all an innovator needs is an idea, a credit card and a computer and he can see his product go from concept to reality in just a matter of days. It is not overly dramatic to say that a person can invent something on Monday and have Fed-Ex deliver the prototype to his front door on Friday! If that isn't a miracle of our times, I'm not sure what is.<br />From the book:<br />\\"The use of common design file standards that allow anyone, if they desire to send their designs to commercial manufacturing services to be produced in any number, just as easily as they can fabricate them on their desktop. This radically foreshortens the path from idea to entrepreneurship as the Web did in software, information and content.\\"<br />And there is optimism with Anderson talking about how \\"Real countries build things\\" and how that is want is really the backbone of our American culture.<br />But we have to be ready for the changes that are occurring. That now and in the future we are going to see many many more companies building specialty products that are capable of changing the world.<br />\\"The days of companies with names like \\"General Electric\\" and \\"General Mills\\" and \\"General Motors\\" are over. The money on the table is like Krill: a billion little entrepreneurial opportunities that can be exploited by smart, creative people.\\"<br />I have to admit that I have read this book twice already, and I think it's because I like the message so much. I love the optimism, the idea that creative people can get their ideas to market as quickly and cheaply as possible with a few barriers as possible.<br />There is no more dealing with rigid gate keepers putting up barriers to keep people out. In publishing for example the days of the arrogant editor with his pile of manuscripts from anxious would be authors over. Now it's \\"The hell with that editor, I'll publish it myself!\\" the proof of that being that there are now a number of bestsellers that originated through electronic self-publishing. I love that idea.<br />And now in terms of new product develop and in terms of people with great ideas being able to get those ideas to market as quickly and simply as possible, there has never been a better time.<br />From the book:<br />\\"On the product-development side, the Maker Movement tilts the balance toward cultures with the best innovation model, not the cheapest labor. Societies that have embraced \\"co-creation,\\" or community-based development, win. They are unbeatable for finding and harnessing the best talent and more motivated people in any domain. Look for those countries where the most vibrant Web communities flourish and the most innovative Web companies grow. Those are the values the predict success in any twenty first century market.\\"<br />If you are feeling bad about where we are today and want to feel better, then read this book, if you are worried about the election and where this country is going read this book. And finally if you want to learn more about how you can go about getting your ideas developed and to market read this book because the author even provides a step of directions on how to develop your 21st Century Workshop.<br />Like I said this is the most important book you will read this year and from the buzz that it is creating I believe it will become one of the cornerstone books of our generationt tilts the balance toward cultures with the best innovation model, not the cheapest labor.

B00422LESO|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.  It is one of my staples.  I go back to it time and time again.  I also love chick lit books so when I saw this, I had to buy and read.  It did not disappoint.  I was able to identify with the main character because she was just obsessed with Mr. Darcy and the Bennett romance as a lot of us are.  Bringing it to modern day and adding a humorous twist to it, made it a very good read.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|Adele's global rise to stardom came with 22 an album you could listen start to end with each track being worthy of its own release as single. Katy Perry's rise came with Teenage Dream that scored 8 hits, a new record for the most singles ever from one cd by a female artist.<br /><br />With RED, Taylor Swift is going to join this elite group of mega-stars whose albums will be played for years to come.<br />It is simply perfect, the right blend of pop, dance, and country and of upbeat tunes and ballads. There is something for everyone be it young tweens (fans of Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez) who can relate to the infectious \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" to us older music fans who grew up on U2 and Duran Duran who will see that influence on edgier tracks like \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" and \\"Red.\\"  These two will easily become future singles.<br /><br />\\"Begin Again\\" (Taylor's next single) is a great ballad and reminds you of Adele's video \\"Someone Like You\\" in the fact that both capture the beauty and magic of Paris as the drawback to love and relationships... \\"Everything Has Changed\\" with one of England's rising young pop stars Ed Sheeran, will serve to widen Taylor's appeal beyongd North America.<br /><br />Taylor should be praised for broadening her musical roots, involving different producers and artists. Being only 22, the world is her oyster and hopefully we will all enjoy her musical talents for years to come! I am officially now a huge fan and proud owner of the deluxe version of this cd!

B0044RUSZM|2.0|I have the rain design mstand for my setup, and for my wife I ordered this to add variety. Well, they do the job, they are just stands afterall, but my mstand feels so much sturdier. The difference between an American car and German car. Everything feels very fragile, low quality and lightweight, but the mstand seems like it was made by Apple, same look and feel as my MacBook Pro.
B004132HZS|4.0|First off, I am a diehard fan of the Jeremy Brett/Granada series.  I bought this for my wife, assuming I would be forced to sit and stew whilst some new director transmogrified my favorite literary character beyond recognition.  To my surprise, I very much enjoy this series.  The actor playing Sherlock obviously did his homework and actually does a very nice job of making Holmes his \\"own character\\" while at the same time channeling Brett by his facial expressions, movements, and vocal cadence.  Witty, funny, and intriguing.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the ending to episode 1 is quite lame.....all I could think of was Princess Bride \\"clearly I cannot chose the cup in front of me.\\"<br /><br />I eagerly await purchasing the second season.  Why can;t they make funny, witty, intelligent shows like this in the U.S.?
B008AX18Y6|4.0|Salman Rushdie's memoir is quite riveting with lots of narrative and detailed accounts on what he went through during his run from the fatwa. The book also brings out his point of view and how his detractors used the book to criticize his intentions without even reading it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a young adult novel told through letters by Stephen Chbosky. I bought this book for book club and ended up tearing through it in one day. It's an intense read. The author takes the events in the book and spins them on their head a few times and it's... intense. The Good: This book was very well written, very very very engaging, and all kinds of literary fun. The twists were unbelievable. This is definitely a book to reread because you'll get a whole different story the second time through The bad: The character felt too young to be in high school. In retrospect that makes sense, but in the context of the book, other characters react to him or situations like he's in seventh grade. There's lots of \\"Do you understand what just happened?\\" and OMG, a senior is going out with a freshmen, the perv. When I was in high school, and now, teaching high school, there wasn't much in the way of an acknowledged age difference between seniors and freshmen. There is from an adults perspective, but not from the kids themselves. It just kept throwing me, but by the end of the book that attitude was mostly gone.<br /><br />The spoilers: WARNING.... SPOILERS I couldn't get over the suicide note/poem. It was so sad that his friend showed him this poem, and Charlie latched onto it without understanding it was a cry for help. It really added another layer to everything about Michael. I kind of liked that Charlie still never seemed to get that the poem was Michael's suicide note. It made all his thoughts that much more tragic.  The thing with the Aunt just put this whole new spin on the entire book. I'm really curious how all of this is going to translate to film.

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I don't understand how ANYONE can rate this book under five stars. I read it during a cold fall, and it was marvelous. I hope this author continues to write. It is one of the best modern novels I have ever, ever read. Seriously...this book deserves TEN stars or more. Ignore the people who rate it lower. They are obviously looking for something more simply written. This book was FANTASTIC!!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I've been a Reacher fan from the very first and always looked forward to the next book and Reacher's progession. Now after findind out that Tom Cruise is playing<br />Reacher in a movie, I'm done. Can't get the image of Cruise as Reacher out of my mind. It's just so totally wrong. After reading part of this book, I had to put it down. Boring, boring, boring. Mr Childs has sold out. Goodbye Jack, I'll miss ya.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is an ugly story about two ugly \\"beautiful\\" people who torture and manipulate each other, as well as many others in their lives.  It was the first time, in a very long time, that I considered abandoning a mystery about halfway through the book.  Character development is what usually grabs me in a novel, but these two shallow characters had no redeeming qualities that would make you want to root for either one.  I'll admit that I finished the book, just to see which character would \\"win,\\" but they are both \\"losers\\"--deservedly so!  This was the first book by Gillian Flynn that I've read, but it will also be the last.
0307386171|5.0|I have slowly, since ATONEMENT, entering the somewhat claustrophobic, always engaging world of Ian McEwan. This is the fourth novel of his that I have read and continue to be amazed at his tight prose, deeply felt characters and flawed emotions. ON CHESIL BEACH is a simple, brief tale of the honeymoon night of Edward and Florence, two educated Anglos in 1962 England. Both are apprehensive about the wedding night, for different reasons. Their awkward evening is interspersed with their back story, complete with descriptions (vastly different) of their families and childhood. Like the other novels of McEwan I've read, this one is at his most masterful when it reveals what we humans do when faced with an ambivalent, frustrated or fear-inducing situation, which is the case with but the honeymooners. I have always preferred American Lit to its' over-the-pond counterpart, but McEwan, much like Alan Hollinghurst, is able to use the English system of class, history and culture to examine multiple sides to what in America might be cut and dried. ON CHESIL BEACH is a perfect, though slight, novel about the pre-Beatles generation of Englanders keeping the stiff upper lip despite the receding of their own time and place.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|This game was a lot if fun and very pretty. But where is the ending?? I get all the crystals and it just asks if I want to play again. I was expecting a beautiful scene of Atlantis, maybe an angry Posiedon, but it was literally just nothing.
1451695195|3.0|I find this book by Eben Alexander to be both provocative and dissatisfying. It will, I am certain, provoke a lot of discourse but it leaves me, at least, with a lot of unanswered questions. Dr. Alexander tells us that his brain was infected with E. Coli and that his cerebral cortex was rapidly being destroyed, so that if he did survive, he would be a vegetable. And yet on day seven he wakes up and starts speaking. Was Broca's area of his brain destroyed or was it not? If it was destroyed, did it miraculously recover? We are not provided with any evidence (MRI, EEG, etc) one way or the other. I am not opposed to miracles. I just want to see the evidence, so that I can make my own judgment.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander describes some of his experiences in the spirit world, somewhat vaguely, I might say. In other words, he tells of all the knowledge that he received and yet he fails to share any of his new-gained knowledge with us, other than God is Love. While this is important, I am thinking of Tom Sawyer's description of his NDE and the specific knowledge that he purportedly received. He shared some of that with us and thereby we can make our own determination of its validity. Is Dr. Alexander waiting to share some of the knowledge he gained in some future book?<br /><br />Dr. Alexander gives a list of possible physical explanations for his experience, rejecting all of them primarily because his cerebral cortex was purportedly non-functional. Again, no supportive evidence for this. But I would have found it interesting if he had reported in detail some of the responses he received from his fellow scientists when he described his experience to them. How do they explain it? Do they just reject it out of hand, because such experiences are impossible, or do they give some valid alternative explanations for what happened?<br /><br />I am bothered by the extensive Reading List and, especially, Index. I do not see this as a reference book in which I will want to look a lot ofthings up in the Index. Furthermore, there is only limited discussion of NDEs, such that this does not, in my judgment, warrant such an extensive Reading List. A few seminal references would have been fine, as well as a few links. No index.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander is to be commended for his willingness to share his experience. I just wish that he, as a scientist, had provided us with more concrete medical information of what happened to him in this physical world, and more details on the information he purportedly received in the spirit world.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book was a very informative account of the heroism and bravery of Marcus, and his crew and the sacrifices the SOF community makes, and will forever be one of my favorites.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this, partially because I'd never seen a Channing Tatum movie and partially because the male stripper plot looked like fun. Manganiello and Bomer both really built up the entertainment and humor in their interviews. They must be good actors, because they had to know how deadly dull parts of this movie were.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />I would have given this more stars if the seasoned trained actors in addition to McConaughey had been given more screen time. Bomer, Manganiello and Rodriguez could have used more screen time and better sound recording. If their lines were meant to be background noise in the dressing room, house and beach scenes then it didn't work for me. I wanted to actually hear what was being said.<br /><br />I would have given it more stars if the strip routines had been longer than the trailer cuts. Seems the tease was all there was. I saw interviews with Bomer and Manganiello about their routines and actually expected to see more of their work. Yes I admit to prurient interest, it's not a crime.<br /><br />It seemed strange some plot points just disappeared. Manganiello blows out his back during a lift and nothing is followed up. Kevin Nash's Tarzan is on the floor from what looked like an OD, which was the motivation for getting Pettyfer on stage, but no indication of what happened to Nash afterward. Bomer and his wife are into foursomes but we only see his wife once, why bother casting his wife, a groupie would have served the plot?<br /><br />If there was a half star available I would have given this a 2 1/2 because Tatum is pretty wooden, his love interest even more so.<br /><br />And the topper: nothing says decadence more than a baby pot bellied pig at a drug fueled orgy.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great Movie! Lots of action with very good special effects.  Great for the whole family.  A must see movie for action goers
B005ERYEGU|5.0|This book caught my eye due to the fact the author worked at salesforce.com for several years which was before my time when I worked there in 2006-2009.  I saw the impact of his work setting up the lead generation system which was second to none of the companies I've worked for and with.  So being able to see into the window of how he accomplished this growth was fantastic.  I've taken about five really great ideas and implemented them with success in my own prospecting system.  I recommend the book highly.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Brilliantly done.  part 2 as good as part one.  Can't wait for the final book in this trilogy.  Follett's research is impeccable and his story telling compelling, which makes for most enjoyable reading while you are picking up a bit of social history as well.  Thoroughly recommended.
1439152802|5.0|The Secret Keeper by Kate Morton is truly the best kind of book - it is a thrilling story full of heart and humor, and has a delightfully unexpected ending.  It kept me guessing the whole time.<br /><br />The story centers around Dorothy and her daughter, Laurel, and a secret that impacted them both one summer afternoon.  A teenage Laurel peeks out of her tree house loft to see a stranger approach her mother and baby brother and watches as her mother stabs him.  Laurel tries to make sense of it, but pushes it to the back of her mind for fifty years until her mother is in hospice care and nearing the end of her life.  Sparked by a dated photo in an inscribed copy of Peter Pan, Laurel becomes intrigued by a chapter of her mother's life that was hidden for so many decades.  Determined to understand who the man was, why her mother would do such an unexpectedly out-of-character thing, and whether her mother can be blamed, Laurel (now a famous actress), must uncover Dorothy's secret.<br /><br />With beautiful voice and power, The Secret Keeper unravels the events of the past by looking back at Dorothy as a young girl, Laurel in the present day, and those who have crossed their paths over the ages.  Through painstaking research, Laurel comes to discover that her mother isn't exactly who she appeared to be for so many years, and that a shocking series of events in WWII led her to live a life filled with regret and dreams of the past.  This story is magnificently told, and despite its length, I found myself wanting to know all the details of Laurel, Dorothy, Dorothy's former boyfriend, Jimmy, and Dorothy's former friend, Vivien.  The powerful connections between mother and daughter, and all of the sisters in the family are a timeless backdrop for such an original story. The ending is a complete surprise, and I was thrilled that Morton kept me engaged and intrigued the entire time.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough.  The Secret Keeper is a real winner and offerslots of discussion opportunities for book clubs.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book held my attention all the way through. I am so glad I read this series as it is not the type of book I generally read. I am currently home bound due to a illness and this book helped me escape my discomfort as well as my boredom
B008XNZMOU|3.0|My initial impression of Taylor Swift's new album RED was that it's very good, and that's probably a fair assessment, but there are two things that I have to say about it. First, a little history...<br /><br />You see, Taylor's albums have all come two years apart. Her self-titled debut dropped in 2006. FEARLESS followed in 2008, SPEAK NOW in 2010, etc. So it's been six years since her debut, and four since what was, in the opinion of myself and many others, her best album. FEARLESS showed some of the true potential of an emerging young songwriter who combined outstanding pop sensibility with a maturity beyond her years that was both fresh and wholesome. And SPEAK NOW saw her exploring different influences and directions in songwriting. The problem for me comes with RED and the fact that, two years after SPEAK NOW, and four years after FEARLESS, her music leaves me no reason to believe she is any longer mature beyond her years; in fact, she is still singing about the same kind of whimsical experiences that only a person like herself -- young, wealthy, gorgeous -- gets to have. Compare the song \\"Fifteen\\" on FEARLESS, which cautions young girls about the danger of falling in love too young, with \\"22\\" on RED... a song about the mania of being 22 and dancing with guys who are \\"bad news\\".  One shows wisdom not necessarily common among young women her age, while the other eschews that wisdom for potentially reckless whimsy.  So the first thing is this: whatever credit I once gave Taylor Swift for being mature beyond her years has evaporated.<br /><br />The second thing is more easily explained, but also warrants some comparison to older albums. Taylor's debut album was clearly country music. FEARLESS, however, tightly walked the line between country and pop, and this fact is probably why it took off the way it did. SPEAK NOW was, if FEARLESS wasn't, a pop album first and foremost; there were tracks on it that could have just as easily been performed by Evanescence or Paramore. RED not only follows in this tradition of moving away from country and towards pop, but is basically the culmination of this movement. RED is the kind of pop album one could expect from any of a countless number of industry-produced pop stars who are largely disposable. So yes, it's catchy as all hell, but not the way I personally want a Taylor Swift album to be. And I get that much of this might be due to outside pressure. And no, I don't blame her for wanting to be a bazillionaire. But the reality, as far as I can tell, is that she sold out with this album.<br /><br />Do I trust her as an artist to find her way again? That's the question someone essentially posed to me while we were talking about this. My answer is: I do. I think RED probably marks the end of one phase of her career, even knowing that it will be ridiculously successful from a commercial standpoint, but I think she has the talent to reinvent herself before she really does become just another disposable popstar. And if not, well, I'll still have FEARLESS and the best tracks from SPEAK NOW to remind me of what she could've and, in my opinion, should've been.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|For fans of Lee Child and Jack Reacher there is a lot that you will be familiar with. It seemed to me that this novel was more descriptive than the previous ones which maybe padded it out a bit.<br /><br />I also found the final scenes a little far fetched in that Jack appears to have become more of a super hero than in the previous novels, never the less I did enjoy the book and will no doubt read the next in the series.
0345803485|3.0|Here's the bottom line to this book; It's not well written. I joked with friends that you could easily turn it into a drinking game. Take the word \\"murmur\\" for example. Down a shot each time you see that word and you'll be thoroughly trashed by Chapter 3. Yet, for some reason even with the juvenile writing, disjointed sentences, lack of character development (I mean, come on, NOTHING about Christian Gray tells me he's actually smart enough or savvy enough to be so successful and rich) and you still find yourself reading this book. It's like a train wreck. You know its awful, you know you should turn away and yet you keep on reading. You actually want to know what happens. It's sort of like one of those horrible reality TV shows that America is so engrossed in anymore. While you can actually hear your brain cells dying you keep moving forward through the chapters. So, if you are willing to get past the horrible writing, lack of character development and oh so \\"Twilight-esque\\" childish romance then buy this book. Just don't expect much because you'll be disappointed.

1468179993|5.0|I read this book a few weeks before giving my TedTalk. Even though I'm a professional storyteller and have years of performance experience, this book really helped me tailor my talk for my audience. With tons of recommendations about other great talks throughout the book, I had my work cut out for me. I watched every video the author recommended and learned a ton in the process. The book is an easy read in a good way. Once I read It once I knew I was going to go back and reread it. Many of my friends who have given TedTalks were jealous that I had a book like this to use. I highly recommend it!

B006LSZECO|2.0|The premise of this book is so creative and it keeps you interested until about half way and then you realize there is no likable character you can root for. Plus, the ending is a big dud.
B009IJJ712|3.0|The beginning really put me off, but I decided to keep watching and I'm glad I did. The one after the pilot is even better. I do hope this series makes it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book is very well written with historically correct dialogue and settings.  The author gets you interested in the story from the start and leads you on an emotional journey.  My overall review would be that it is a 4 out of 5. my only criticism being there are a few 'frustrating' moments in the book, which are a bit unbelievable. other than that I think it's a beautifully written well told story, and a great read.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Set aside a few days to get lost in the landscape that is this book....be prepared to be stunned, dazzled, and provoked....to laugh, to cry, to be astonished, horrified, thrilled, mezmerized, and ultimately provided with a rich and wonderful read....This book went to the very top of my \\"all time faves\\" list...You'll be thinking about it for a long, long time...

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland features the best writing and acting I've ever seen on TV. The complexity of the characters and the plot development are without compare.
B002MGIIZE|5.0|Though I appreciate the theatrical version of Donnie Darko, the cutting of the film for the big screen only manages to create questions. Here, in the director's cut, those questions are answered and our hero Donnie Darko begins to make as much sense as a born enigma might.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Some good stuff here.  If you don't like superhero flicks, why would you like this? But if you do, this is one to get under your belt. Good action, decent story line, and not just a repeat of others...although there is some Transformers- aliens-invade earth stuff going on.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very thought-provoking book. When I finished reading it, I couldn't bring myself to read anything else for a week. I wanted to savor it and all it meanings. I read them in January 2012 and tried to tell all my friends about it, but it was only out in Kindle format. So glad that it is getting a name for itself. Good job Howey! Keep 'em coming!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was surprised.  I actually loved Wool and was sorry to see it end.  One of the things I liked a lot was how \\"IT\\" was portrayed.  I work in an organization with IT as a pivotal focus and where it definitely feels like they have more power than the executive team.  This book only confirmed that feeling.  It was entertaining to see the spin the author put on it.  There is still room to grow with this novel and I hope to see that there is a continuing story in the future.

B009AMAM9S|5.0|David Mitchell is one of my absolute favorite writers, and Cloud Atlas is among my favorite novels. It was my top pick for 2004.  I've previously blogged about my unusual first encounter with Mr. Mitchell while he was touring for Cloud Atlas. (Google \\"David Mitchell returns to San Francisco\\" if you're curious.)  Good times!<br /><br />Anyway, considering my love of the novel, you can imagine that I've been looking forward to the film with equal measures of anticipation and trepidation. You always want the film to do the source material justice, but it's rare that it actually happens. Especially when you're looking at a novel as complex as Cloud Atlas. It was said by many to be unfilmable, and if asked, I would have agreed.<br /><br />And I would have been so very wrong. What Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer have achieved is nothing short of astounding. I'll cut to the chase and tell you that I LOVED this film. It will surely be my favorite of the year.<br /><br />Have you read Cloud Atlas? The novel has a very unusual structure. Mitchell's an experimental writer. The novel is composed of six linked stories taking place in six different time periods and comprised of six different literary genres. Yeah, that's not too ambitious. The novel opens with the most distant story in the past, a 19th century adventure at sea. Halfway through, the story ends abruptly, mid-sentence. Next, we're at the home of a once-eminent European composer in the early 20th century. That, too, ends abruptly, and now we're embroiled in a mystery in early 1970's San Francisco. But halfway through the tale just stops and we're on to a high comedy set near the present day. After reading half of Timothy Cavendish's ghastly ordeal, we're suddenly in the science fiction world of a futuristic and dystopian Seoul--for half a story. And finally, we're in far-distant, post-apocalyptic Hawaii, in a tale written entirely in pigeon English. And at last, the story goes all the way through to the end, after which the second half of the Seoul story commences, followed by all the others in reverse order.<br /><br />The film is... totally not like that. It's structured completely differently, with quick scenes from all six stories rapidly juxtaposed against each other. There is constant shifting. It's an amazing way to tell the tale(s), but it works. It more than works. It really drives home the novel's abstract themes of connectedness. After the film, one of the things my friends and I commented upon was the staggering job of editing this film. I can't imagine what went into it, but it was masterful.<br /><br />What these three writer/directors--apparently with limited input from Mr. Mitchell--did with this screenplay is extraordinary. It is brilliant. Now, it's been eight years since I read the novel, so my memory of the details is not so fresh, but by my reckoning, the screenplay was remarkably true to Mitchell.  I recognized dialogue taken verbatim from the novel.  Yes, there were elisions, but they were minor. The composer's daughter was removed entirely. She's a character that stands out in my mind due to a memorable later cameo in Mitchell's Black Swan Green, but you know what? She was superfluous. The film didn't need her. I'm sure there were other minor changes, but nothing at all that made me cry foul. No, as I watched the film, memories of the novel came flooding back in the most wonderful way. These filmmakers did a magnificent job of realizing the world(s) that David Mitchell had created.<br /><br />The film boasts an impressive a-list cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, and so many others. And you've never seen these actors like this. No one has. Go to IMDB and read the cast credits. They're all double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, and sextuple cast! You can't possibly catch or recognize all of their iterations. The actors change age, race, nationality, and gender across the roles. The makeup work is extraordinary, and if the film doesn't win the Oscar, there is simply no justice. Trying to spot Hugh Grant (mostly in smaller supporting roles) buried under old man or cannibal makeup is all kinds of fun, but this is far more than Hollywood stunt casting. The casting reflects the novel's themes. It gets the message across at times almost subliminally. It also gives these stars the opportunity to really flex their acting muscles.  Tom Hanks brings down the house in a brief comic turn as a thuggish author. When have we seen this actor play so many different colors in a single film? It reminds viewers of just how good he is. Oh yeah, that's what those Oscars were for. The same can be said of much of the cast. I strongly encourage you to stay for the credits--at least long enough to see the photos of the actors in their many roles flash by. You will be shocked by what you missed. THAT was Halle Berry? you'll find yourself thinking.<br /><br />Oh, and look for author Mitchell in a cameo as a \\"Union Spy.\\" I didn't catch him, but I'll be on the lookout next time. Because I plan to see this film many, many times. There's just too much to take in. I'd venture I'll catch something new every time I see this film in years to come. Even at the lengthy running time of 2:44, I was ready to walk right back into the theater and start over from the beginning. The film held me transfixed, and I can't wait to see it again. Not to mention, I've already got a wish list in my mind of DVD extras!<br /><br />I don't generally write movie reviews, but Cloud Atlas has inspired me. The ideas, the themes, the imagery of David Mitchell's wonderful and ground-breaking novel have sprung to life. It is magical. I attended an advance screening with several members of my book group the other night, and there was equal enthusiasm from those who had read the novel, and those who hadn't. Among my group, there were six thumbs way up, and one lonely dissenter--but she can write her own review. Mine is an unqualified rave. Go. See. This. Film.ionality, and gender across the roles.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a highly captivating book about the relationship between two very different people with their own set of needs. It is an interesting how they work together to meet those needs.

B0024FA18K|1.0|The translation is fine. The content is delusional, spacey, and generally badly written. My reason for reading the book is to try to understand how hitler's Germany could have existed. Only gave it a star because the review pg won't let me finish with no stars...

B0095R64AO|5.0|This movie was two snaps up and a circle. I just love romantic comedies and this one is suited my taste well. there were some slow parts but overall it rocked!!!
B008QE9XD2|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this film. In a nutshell: it seems as though Tim Burton is trying too hard to be \\"Tim Burton\\". We've all seen up and coming director's trying to copy the style of previous great directors and completely fall short of the mark. In this case it's Burton trying to copy himself.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I have been a huge Tim Burton fan since the beginning, even using his work for a final in my film class. After all who can go wrong with a guy whose dream was to be the guy in the Godzilla suit!<br /><br />Sadly, his movies of late are missing an element that made his movies unique and quirky masterpieces. It's almost as if a child has gotten bored with his favorite toy, yet still goes through the motions in playing with it.<br /><br />This movie is DULL! Lackluster performances by ALL the actors/actresses involved. Every character is flat out boring, and gives you absolutely no reason to become invested in them. The humor is tired, unoriginal and just not humorous. The beloved quirkiness of Burton's previous films like Edward Scissorhands (one of the best films ever) is absent. The story-line has the same affect of fingernails on a chalkboard. The bulk of the characters have zero purpose.<br /><br />Quite frankly, Burton needs to get over his man-crush with Johnny Depp. His movies are beginning to prove that directors shouldn't direct their significant others. It's time to bury the Burton/Depp/Bonham-Carter triangle. It's becoming old and too comfortable...with each providing a \\"lazy\\" product. What previous chemistry there was has evaporated and these great talents are going to waste.<br /><br />There really isn't anything good about this film. Each aspect, directing...acting...writing...style...cinematography...all sub-par and boring. Nothing here to stimulate your senses to make you want to sit through this cinematic train wreck!
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read! It was hard to put the books down and I wanted to keep finding out what was going to happen next! This is truly a love story!!!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I purchased this for the Kindle because I have it on my iPhone.  It is not nearly as good.  It is s;low and cumbersome to use.  I don't whether it is due to the software or the Kindle,.  Either way I would not recommend it.
0321811984|5.0|I got this book at the library and read it and felt it was so good and such a great reference book, I decided to buy it.  It really keeps you on point to putting together great presentations, and the results for me have been really good.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their presentations and improve the level of how they think about making their presentations more effective and interesting.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This is a pretty good bridge builder game as bridge games go, but the load times do seem excessive considering what is being loaded.  The graphics are prettier that any other bridge games I've played.  The actual analysis is about as good as similar programs, or perhaps a little better, but this is obviously not STAAD that you're getting for two bucks.  The touch control has an interesting gimmick in that when you are placing a member, the end being placed is not directly under your finger.  The means that you can see where you are putting the member, but it is confusing at first.
1401238580|1.0|I'm really disappointed.<br /><br />No need to spend any words on the book. It's a classic.<br /><br />But I'm still trying to figure where's the deluxe finish or the collector's level in this pityful set that I've just received. To make it simple, it is not the one in the product pictures. The mask seems to be one of those that kids get for free in birthday parties. It is made of a cheap plastic, full of stickers in the inside. Besides that, you can easily notice how it was poorly handcut, probably with common scissors and by someone that don't have steady hands. It also comes with a hanging tab that, guess what, it wasn't shown in product pictures.<br /><br />The box is also not the one in the pictures. A cheap cellophane completely loose and unglued at the time it arrived. The box was full of smashed edges. Well, not just the edges, it was all smashed. Even the book could have a better quality paper.<br /><br />There's anything deluxe in this set, and anything for a collector. It was cheap, indeed, but customers deserve to know what they are buying, no matter what price they are paying. If I knew, I would have bought any other hardcover version of the product.<br /><br />Right now, I feel deceived and disappointed. Dont buy this, go for any other version.<br /><br />P.S.:  Sorry for any grammar mistakes, my english is a little rusted.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Jack Reacher carries the day, with a little help from his friends. he dealt with his enemies in true Jack Reacher fashion. It was great.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|I found the book very dark, lacking in believability and thus suspense, rather repetitive and if there was a love connection, I didn't accept it. I would'nt recommend it to readers of over 50.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Reacher is a man for all reasons. He sees a wrong, and corrects it. He is loyal to his friends, dangerous to his enemies. A great read.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|I love Sylvia Day books and this one didn't disappoint.  She keeps you captivated throughout the whole book.  I think this story about Gideon and Eva is better than Fifty Shades.  Have already pre ordered the next book.  Can't wait for it to arrive.  Keep them coming Sylvia.
B000IK8JTG|5.0|I loved this movie could watch it over and over felt like I was right there living it and it is the best Wuthering Heights ever I will forever long to be with Cathy and Hecliff. I even just bought this one I'm saving it for a cold rainy day. :)
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I too agree that George Martin is getting lost in his detail.  His writing which has been good, now feels like he took a writing course from Jaqmes Fennimore Cooper.  A chapter of the book could be reduced to a paragraph.  I also am tired of hearing the word \\"C__t\\" when referring to any woman.  It may be appropriate to use this highly offensive word occasionally for emphasis, but I started wondering if the author either dislikes women or has \\"had enough\\".  It degrades the books overusing it.<br />I also am listening to this book on CD and the reader, Roy Dotrice, is fluent in speach, sounds like he is 80 years old, and his characters, especially the young women, sound like they are old crones.  Even children sound 90.<br />I tend to always finish a book once started, but this gives me pause to reconsider doing this.<br />The series is taking on the same tired writing that Stephen King had in the last books of his \\"Gunslinger \\" series.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|This is a good police procedural. If you like the feel of the show, you'll like the book. This is a nice mix of mystery, humor, and a little bit of steamy-ness.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love love the game! I bate that it is to be continued but at this price was totally worth it would recommend !
0439023521|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a book written by the author Suzanne Collins. In my opinion, this book  has a number of genres, such as: actions, adventure, maybe even some romance, sci-fi, and a little bit of drama. I especially like the action parts of this book, when the main character, Katniss, is hunting for food, or when she is training to enter the Hunger games. The main theme of this book, I would say is the inequality of the rich and wealthy people, and the poor people of the lower districts. The rich people have to barely work at all to gain their money or are just born into it. The poor people have to slave around all day in mines and other places, and they barely make pennies a day. I also like how Suzanne Collins writes this book, because when this book starts to get really suspenseful a little bit after the beginning, that suspense stays inside of your mind until the Hunger Games are over. I also thought that a lot of the characters were very extraordinary, especially the ones in District One.<br />I enjoyed the setting and the plot of this story very much. It was unlike any book that I had read before. It was almost like a post apocalyptic feeling even though it only took place in the non distant future.  It felt post apocalyptic because there was a massive civil war that took place, and an entire District in Panem. I also enjoyed the characters very much because I can relate to them very much. They all have to work hard for what they can get, and once they have it, they have to keep working harder to keep it.<br /> Panem is basically America in the future, but it has been separated into thirteen districts. Then the districts became enraged at the capitol and revolted, a war broke out and ended with huge bombs dropping on District thirteen, completely obliterating it and ending the war. That got me wondering if the people fear the capitol and its people, or just the power that those people posses. Then I figured it all out, they do not fear the people there, they just hate them so much because the capitol people have everything and the other regular people have nothing except for the top three districts. They also fear that the capitol posses because the President could decide to drop bombs on them at any given time, and to the capitol people, killing is merely a game, and they kill mercilessly.<br />I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that you enjoy reading it as much as I do.

B009NCM248|5.0|As a disclaimer, I am a Slipknot fan first, and it took me a little while to warm up to Stone Sour back when their self-titled debut came out. I think that debut will probably always be their best, although I did enjoy Come What(ever) May as well. I was extremely disappointed by Audio Secrecy, however, since there were only a handful of decent songs and the rest sounded like generic watered down pop jingles that I couldn't believe Corey Taylor lowered himself to sing. Which is why I was so thrilled to hear their newest, House of Gold & Bones Pt 1.<br /><br />It still isn't as grimy and grungy as their self-titled, but it is just as dark and heavy in many ways, and is definitely comparable to Come What(ever) May. I think a lot of people forget that Stone Sour was never supposed to be a death metal band, and get so upset when it doesn't sound like Slipknot. Whatever you want to label them as, on this album especially, they effortlessly blend crunching riffs and heavy beats with beautiful, catchy melodies and choruses, and I just can't stop listening to it. James' and Josh's guitars are blistering and haunting, Corey's growls are brutal, and I also loved the subtle addition of strings and electronics into the background of a couple of the tracks. The only song on here that comes close to feeling a bit contrived is \\"Absolute Zero\\" and for me it's mainly the chorus and the rest of the song more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Corey Taylor has once again proven why he is one of the best hard rock/metal vocalists out there today, and his lyrical brilliance has never been better. \\"Taciturn\\" is a perfect example of a song that at first seems very simple and something we've heard before, but the verse lyrics and melody are simply beautiful. If you loved Come What(ever) May, buy this album. No question. Even if you loved their self-titled debut, I would say give some of the songs a chance. There will always be haters, but I know I can't wait for Part 2!<br /><br />Stand-out tracks: \\"Gone Sovereign\\", \\"Rumor of Skin\\", \\"RU486\\", \\"Taciturn\\" and \\"Influence of a Drowsy God\\"

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't know how anyone cant like this game! it has a challenge to it and fun for almost any age! I say almost because if u let a 4 year old play it... I honk they would just acre up your screen... well I went on a tangent. anyways... GREAT GAME!
1469984202|5.0|What an amazing piece of science fiction. Proof that self-published novels can be every bit as good (and probably in most cases so much better) than what the publishing houses decide is fit to print. Spend $5 and enjoy yourself.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This one of the best books I've read this year.  Interesting story, one most parents would not like to think about. The characters were well developed.lots of twists and turns in the plot . But the ending will keep you thinking, and not knowing for sure what really happened.  I'll be looking for other book by this author.
1416596585|4.0|Google is hardly perfect, but it is the perfect example of the world's first true \\"information economy\\" company. You can't help but realize, when reading this, that the corporate model and strategies that Google developed are the future, and corporations who are risk-averse, slow, or weighed down by bureaucracy don't stand a chance in the early part of the 21st century. Highly recommended.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Great great cd! Corey and the rest of SS really knocked this out of the park. Best album in a long time
1439170916|5.0|Such a coherent and eloquent book - everything I thought it would be. Doesn't pull any punches. It's not overly encouraging, but neither is it a huge bucket of cold water. This is a book anyone with even a passing interest in cancer should read - and anyone who is suffering from or knows someone who is suffering from cancer as well. I can't recommend it enough.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Would highly recommend this movie!  Lots of surprises, comedy moments and thrills as well.  I definitely see us re-watching this as a favorite for many years.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is amazing. I am really hard to get up in the mornings but this app does it! I love this app so much! It can give you math problems with a certain difficulty for each alarm, and that's what I like to do! I like this app and would highly recommend it for heavy sleepers like me.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love it! Had a similar game on an old lap top and I've missed playing it. When I got my Kindle Fire, I discovered this app and have really enjoyed playing the game again. Lots of setting choices.[[ASIN:B0063GORYU Spider]]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|it was the best books that i have read in a long time i hope there is more to come
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2yo is obsessed with trucks, diggers, etc, and he loves this game. When a puzzle is completed, balloons are \\"released\\" for the child to pop, which is almost like having a 2nd game.
034552554X|5.0|Bought used and the book arrived as it was advertised.  Great service.  Arrived prior to estimated date, which is always a plus.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Awesome! Great story line and character development. Fast paced and no needless rambling. Cannot wait for the next book in this series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book wasn't the standard courtroom or even whodunit drama. It was much richer.  Anyone who is interested in how genetics impacts our behaviors will enjoy it. It is well written, thought provoking and believable.
B009329ZF2|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Even though it is absolutely an action flick, there were also several scenes that made us laugh. The CGI is off the charts; it is so realistic as to be totally believable. The section of the movie that used the actual Battleship game board setup was really cool. We whole-heartedly recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good action flick or (fantasy) war story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is a brilliant writer, and sets a bar that will be virtually unattainable.  I expected it would take me a summer of weekends to finish the Omnibus, but I couldn't put it down and was done in a week.<br /><br />I've now hunted down and read everything he's written, and value every moment.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|It had a great storyline and I could tell where Chris Nolan got some of his ideas for the Dark Knight Rises
B009NQKPUW|5.0|People who just rated the movie 1 star are being highly unfair to the creativity of the script and the talent of the actors. I bet that many of those \\"1 star voters\\" didn't even catch the symbolism in most of the movie. Sure there are moments that the audience cringes saying: why did that character DO THAT? But that adds to the suspense of the film. In crisis, not everyone makes the wisest of choices. Half of the movie I was yelling at the screen: \\"Bad Robot!\\". For me, he was the most interesting character besides Elizabeth (who by the way did a good job). As an audience member, half of the time I was wondering \\"why is he doing that?\\" and \\"what is he thinking\\"?<br /><br />There are surprise moments in the film. I thought it was well paced and not slow.<br /><br />I'm rating it 4.5 stars for the overall combination of the concept, script, art, character design and acting. The symbolism is noticeable. It's all over the place. I won't spoil it here, but if you want to know more about it, google it.<br /><br />Yes, the creator of this work dropped some references to Alien in the movie, but if you've never watched it, those references do not distract from the plot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was not what I had expected from the title.  However, it turned out to be much more interesting than I had anticipated.  Call it a psycho-thriller.  Just when I think I had it figured out where it was going, the story took another twist.  I enjoyed the manner in which it was written -- part in diary form and part in first person narrative.  I highly recommend this book.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. I already beaten it. I love the graphics and the fact that you can go online for the walkthrough if needed.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|This book didn't reach my expectations like I thought it would. It was boring at some parts but fun in the other. The only thing that I really didn't like was the ending. It just pissed me off.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is amazing. I really enjoy using it while at home. I would recommend it if a calculator is needed.
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|This is an amazon show to start with and I had to buy this season because it wasn't on Netflix and I wanted to be caught up for season 8. It's better than expected and all the other seasons. If you don't have Netflix I would suggest saving some money and buying all the seasons in order
B008M721MS|1.0|the app in my android works great.  anytime i have my wifi connected, and the phone service is on airplane mode- i  receive calls,  not as loud/ ringtone accesibilities but, it work.  now in the other hand-the app for the kindle is completely the opposite in ways where it dont notify me on calls:  if you consider the kindle light turning on a notification then bohoooo.  i give this a no star.  not worth it. but it dont let me submit unless i give it a one star.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I wanted to like Casual Vacancy. The two stars are for the excellence of the writing. J.K. Rowling has a wonderful turn of phrase and the ability to draw you into a world completely unlike your own. However, the plot was unrelentingly depressing. If I want to feel hopeless and sad, I'll read the news, not a book.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Low rating because Amazon App can't brings timely updates that don't delete all of your progress.  2 week delay is bull.  I want my money back, I will use it to purchase from Google Play and start over.  AGAIN!  Not a happy customer.
0143121006|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book. I have spent a large amount of time in the far east and the Chinese customs were very interesting to me. Good adventure/action story...unfortunately regarding a young lady's death.
1455527475|5.0|This book was a surprisingly entertaining insider's look at the inner workings of Goldman Sachs.  Smith is an impressive writer, setting the story of his career against that of the bank's deteriorating culture.  This book serves an overview of the various conflicts on Wall Street and describes them in a way that any layperson without financial background can understand.  Smith weaves in humor and entertaining anecdotes and I was suprised at how engaging a read it became.  I'd recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about Wall Street and its conflicts or just wants to read an well-told story.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This season was just what I had been waiting for, i'm so hooked i finished the entire season in two days and i can't wait until january when the third season starts...favorite things to look forward to is the excitement that shirley maclaine will bring opposite of maggie smith. that and more great costuming, the detailing of the wardrobe of the era is very beautiful.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The Marware case fit my Kindle snugly and looked great too.  Liked that it was a standing case.  Took it to my son's wedding in Houston, and it became a fixture on the nightstand!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is very fun and extremely addictive. the graphics are great and the objectives are actually challenging.  I would definitely recommend this app.
0525953728|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book; but I loved it.  It is so readable.  I couldn't put the book down.  Kudos to the author.  I learned so much about the seals lives.  What a sacrifice they have made for our country and their families.  What honorable soldiers. What heroes.  America will always be indebted to what they did.  And, no one should face any charges for letting us know the truth.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. I think that it is very addicting. I can not stop playing it. I would reccomend this game to anyone. its very easy and very fun
B008VVT51U|5.0|The movie held my attention.  I was interested in all the characters.  it was different without being totally disgusted and vulgar like most movies these days.
1417664681|5.0|Haven't gotten around to reading the book yet, but i LOVE the turtleback binding on this book.  Arrived promptly with no issues.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|This app has been wonderful. I can start my homework on my computer and finish it on my phone which makes doing homework so much easier for me. I highly recommend this app! Also it navigates like MS Word so you don't have to spend time hunting around looking for things to edit your work which was also a major plus.
B007PKDW44|5.0|Awesome sound from this band. One of my new favorite groups. Almost has an old Metallica vibe. Great CD, for sure
B0008ENICU|5.0|The lead wife (Mary) is a good woman married to a really good guy (Steve). A little before the 10 year anniversary mark, the marriage undergoes a challenge from an outside predator, directed at the husband. Unfortunately, our good little woman, through bad advice and some hurt pride, passively allows him to slide away from her. The general premise is that he will miss her and come back. But, it develops into a hostile takeover. Now, she gets to live with the results of all this conventional wisdom. Through process and circumstance, she eventually comes awake, gets fired up and finally gets in the ring.<br /><br />The general wrench of the story is watching (not literally of course - no men) a perfectly intelligent man so easily played upon by such a shallow subject. Since his wife has run off on a little getaway on the strength of some of that poor advice and the pride, the field is left wide open. But, it works its way to a happy ending that allows you to unwind. And, it is written so as to give you some thrills along the way as comeuppance comes to call on the conniving antagonists. A TCM announcer said the classic cat fight of all times was in this movie. It will definitely engage your attention. But it doesn't start at the ranch -- it runs all the way through!<br /><br />So much has been noted about this now classic women's picture, but wanted to comment on something about the Joan Crawford character seen in a lot of the films from this period. She works at a sales counter, yet has a nice place of her own and great clothes. She played a lot of shop girls, always having a knockout wardrobe, including over the top evening clothes and a very well appointed apartment. In the real world, a sales girl would have to be living at home or at the Y or have at least one roommate, and wouldn't be able to afford an expensive wardrobe. But, this all goes with the movies from that period, which, regardless, will always have a special place for many.<br /><br />Also, really enjoyed Virginia Grey's part as the savvy sales girl who prickles Crystal while she's on the phone with Steven. \\"Holy mackerel, what a line!\\" With so much cleverness going on, that sequence doesn't get much mention, but found it very funny.  How about that beauty clinic! What a setup.  And we do love to admire the clothes, which were so fabulous then with their dressing up so much. There's a lot to check out in this picture, as well as catching the snappy lines, as has been mentioned here.  You literally cannot catch most of it when the gang is all together.  Consecutive re-watches are mandatory.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|after playing the games starting at halo 3 i still had a lot of unanswered questions.this book answered most of them.in this book i felt i was along side master cheif ,and was on the bridge with captain keyes.
B007QNRMUU|3.0|I was a real fan of his first CD's but this one is pretty so so.  Nothing really new or special.  I liked a few of the first MP3's on this CD but the others are just OK.  Not bad to listen to but just not unique or notable.
0385536828|5.0|Beautiful Serena Frome's life has the normal bumps and twists of anyone else's in 1972 England, but she is unaware that the older man who becomes her lover at Cambridge is involved with espionage until they break up and she is hired by MI5 in London. Not that she becomes a spy--like any working woman of the period, she's just another clerk, typing and staying alert for potential husbands among the self-important government servants. But then she's given an opportunity to join a new secret operation called Sweet Tooth: the recruitment of promising young writers whose conservative political views match those of the government, and who can be expected to write books that persuade readers. These authors are told that they've been chosen by an elite organization that wants to encourage fresh talent, and they must never know that the grant money that keeps them going is actually from MI5. Serena is sent to recruit a writer named Tom Healy, and quickly falls in love with the young intellectual. Their affair moves along happily, marred only by her lingering guilt and fear that confessing the truth about the government deception will destroy their relationship. Along the way she learns more about her Cambridge lover, who has died in disgraced exile, and copes with another man at the office whose infatuation with her leads to a different kind of betrayal. Although it takes a few chapters for the story to catch fire, Serena's experience becomes intriguing as well as suspenseful, and the race toward the ending, when the British press has blown her cover, is compelling. The last chapter is a surprise, and may make readers raise their eyebrows and start the book all over again--to enjoy it in a whole different way.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Good old fashioned Rock and Roll with a Southern twang.  It's amazing that two guys can manage to create a sound this so good.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Firstly, if you haven't read the first two novels in the trilogy, please do. Unlike some others, these really need to be read in order.<br /><br />That said, I'm going to try to be concise. I enjoyed the first two books, immensely. They both hit the ground running and were very difficult to put down. Ms. Collins had excellent character development done early on. You felt a part of the story. They both moved non-stop in their plots. So much so, I looked forward to book 3 and felt the novel disappointing. It seems Katniss takes a back seat, never in control of her destiny, as in the first 2 novels. There are very abrupt endings to some of the story's issues and characters. A good deal of the story revolves around hospitalization, for both emotional and physical healing. Wherein the plots in the first two books were laid out nicely, this one seems to bound all over the place. I didn't find this plot taking off before 85% in the Kindle edition. Unlike some, I liked the ending. Though it was quite a chore getting there. Give it a shot, but don't set your expectations high. It's lethargic compared to 1 & 2, almost as if written by a different author.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|This is a great movie. I've watched it many times, but this time when I watched it with my 6 year old granddaughter it just seemed more magical.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This book opens the door to the intimate life  of the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright. His marriage and subsequent affair with a married woman allows us to see a glimpse of the man beyond his work and the women he loved. Beautifully written so you just fall into each page!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed the book, ignored my domestic chores and just read till I was done, now I'm ready for another! Grisham never lets me<br />down.
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|I use it regularly to convert epubs to mobi format for use on my Kindle Fire.  I've never had a hint of a problem with it.  Can't even guess what those reporting trouble have experienced.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|Excellent, great actors, almost seems real. Watched it with my girl and it was a beautiful choice to relax and snuggle up. Highly reccomend.
B0098VXE50|3.0|It is amazing what Hollywood will and can do to normally innocent and adorable subject.  I, for one, prefer the original story.[[ASIN:B005LAIHSG Snow White and the Huntsman (Extended Edition)]]
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fantastic book, can't wait to read the third book, on pins and needles left you with a definite cliffhanger. Amazing!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|So far it I's great. The one that came with my Kindle fell apart. All of the coast cracked and fell off. Hopefully this one will last. Amazon was very helpful at replacing it.
0553801473|2.0|Just finished reading all five books.  Books 1-2 were very good, kept me reading, book 3 was not quite up to the same par, but still pretty good.  By book 4 there were so many characters being dropped almost completely I was confused, thinking maybe the next book would pick them back up and the story line that went along.  Not so...yet more new characters, and I'm not sure it added anything, in fact it was a hinderence to the original set up to these books.  Left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed that certain story lines that had been so strong and entertaining were dropped liked unwanted baggage for some reason.  What happens to Riccon? Why did you just end it that way for Jon? Where is Jaime? How about Sansa, oh and her mother! Do the Starks ever see each other again? Does Arya return to Westeros? Story lines started and abruptly missing now.  Will there be a book 6? I hope so, I hope it brings all back together and finalizes their stories.  I hope it's worth the money.  No real heroes in here to speak of and the ones you think will do something really big, don't.  Not one.  Like the title says, disappointing...
0060873027|1.0|Unbelievable, poorly written novel by two men who should have known better. The characters give cardboard a bad name. Their dialogue is so wooden and shallow that at first I was mystified, then angry. Their supposed emotions are not only insincere but are actually painful to read. And because of the poorly drawn characters, the plot becomes laughable. The book will sell because of the authors' names, but let me be direct: Under no circumstances should anyone shell out hard-earned dollars for this book. If you want to check it out for yourself, get a copy from the library.
B0094WK9GU|3.0|I was pretty disappointed to get this album and find out it wasn't at all what I was expecting. Since this is a compilation, I expected something like  the Eric Prydz Presents Pryda  or Tiesto's Club Life compilations with a collection of all of the groups released material that they work with for performances. Instead I got a DJ set separated into tracks. That would have been great if it had been included as the continuous mix portion of the album, but each individual song represents anywhere between 50%-75% of the full track. See an earlier released example of Matisse & Sadko - Beating Of My Heart (M-3ox) vs. Sweet Disposition here. [...] The song runs a full 6:30 but on Until One it is 3:58 and the last 20 seconds are the next track fading into the mix. I really wanted to get ahold of the full tracks, but I guess Steve Angello wanted something you could pick up at Target and throw into the CDJ and press play if he lost his USB with his pre-recorded set after a night out with bottle rats the night before.
0061726834|2.0|A very predictable read, with annoying inconsistencies, a ridiculous and unbelievable premise and one dimensional characters who were nothing but ordinary for most of the book. The last quarter of the book was better, but still not worth all the eye rolling I did every time I read about \\"The Book of Shhh\\". Seriously! Some things in this book were just so dumb.<br /><br />I would like to point out two passages that are great examples some of the inconsistencies I couldn't overlook. On page 85 Lena says, \\"I love the music that pipes through the streets, I love the way the steam rising thick from the grills makes the streets look cloudy.\\" Then on page 265 Lena says, \\"Love, Love, Love, Love. A word I've never pronounced, not to anyone, a word I've never even really let myself think.\\"<br /><br />This book was full of things that didn't make sense and got in the way of what I believe was supposed to be a love story. I couldn't focus on the characters. Lauren Oliver is a good writer, I just think the whole \\"I love you but this dystopian society won't let us be together\\" story has been over done and I'm annoyed with it.<br /><br />I've read worse, and at times I was entertained. Two stars
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, I could not put it down.  The best book of the series.  A must read for The Hunger Games fan.
1416550534|3.0|**spoiler alert** I adore Kate Morton and the way she writes, but after reading her other two books (The Forgotten Garden and The Distant Hours) I was disappointed with this book. The House at Riverton lacked the eery mystery and charm the other two books had. The plot wasn't... wait.. what was the plot???? Ohhh... The house maid has a secret, a secret that makes no difference in her life what so ever. And the secret was no surprise! We all knew Robbie really didn't kill himself. I never found my self reading as fast as I could to figure out what ever mystery the next page would hold. The story boils down to a love triangle with a tragic ending. I feel like if Kate would have focused more on the rivalry between the two sisters, and expressed more of the passion between Hannah and Robbie the book would have been better. Instead the book focuses on Hannah and her kept secret. I wish her keeping the secret would have meant something in her life, changed something for her that would have created more of a climax... in HER life. Instead it's only her conscious that's effected. In my opinion Grace was way to happy being a Lady's maid! LOL How could she not feel the injustice done to her by having to be her own sister's maid????<br /><br />My fantasy ending: Grace finds out shes related to Hannah and decides she doesn't want to be her maid anymore! Then thinks up a plan to reveal her betrayal to Emme... ending with the death of Robbie. She then blackmails them into giving her her rightful inheritance and goes on to marry Alfred and they have adventures together! Hannah is left poor and divorced... and Grace finds it in her heart to forgive her and take her in.<br /><br />Despite all the criticism..I did love Kate's writing style and the way she was able to bring me back to that time and place at Riverton so easily.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|All souls delivers an epic account of fantasy. a pleasure to read. i am looking forward to reading the second book in this series.
159514188X|3.0|This book is like one of those optical illusion pictures that are made up completely of little dots. Up close it looks like nothing, but once you step away it turns into a beautiful work of art. When I first started this book I found all Hannah's \\"reasons\\" to be petty and I honestly found her to be kind of ridiculous. I thought the book wasn't realistic and I couldn't take Hannah's emotions very serious. I felt the book lacked the depth the topic of suicide required. I continued reading. After each tape I could understand how these things could build up. The author did a fabulous job of chipping away at the reader, slowly with out us even noticing. I had put myself in Hannah's shoes and realized after a while that I did feel hopeless......and I had no idea why.<br /><br />I tried to figure it out. Surely it wasn't because someone had grabbed my ass, or didn't say bye to me in the hallway..... or was it? No, that wasn't a real reason, so if there wasn't a real reason I could pin point.. then what could possibly be the solution? What can make me feel better?<br /><br />Then I understood it all. And I cried.<br /><br />I'm glad I stuck it out and finished this book. This is one of those reads that annoys you while your in the middle of it, but leaves a mark on you afterward
B007THA4FI|1.0|Sorry, but this book is a disappointment.  Nothing compelling about it.  No really interesting character development or story line. Just a lot of angry teenagers and unrealistic profiling.
1416972242|3.0|The characters are interesting, I love Jace! I want Clary and Jace to be together, I hope in the next book they find out it was all a lie and they are not really brother and sister; I really only want to continue to read the series in the hope that this is true. I don't like the decription of some of the demons.<br /><br />\\"....a monster with the legs of an elephant and the head of a mosquito..\\"<br /><br />Guess I just dont have that much of an imagination, but when I read stuff like that I kind of get sucked out of my fantasy world and realize I'm reading a book for teenagers and I'm not really some kick ass chick in love with a supper hot guy who may or may not be my brother. :)
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Got Freely app and must say I like it a lot for layout and offerings. Easy to navigate and new content is added very quickly. Haven't been bored with it yet and that says a lot.
0143034901|4.0|Historical fiction is not my favorite genre, but pushing through the long winded details to get to the jaw dropping wonderfulness of this mystery was well worth it. I read the first 20 pages of this book and thought I was in for an awesome read. I was then disappointed when it started to feel like I was reading boring news paper clippings about the war in Barcelona in the 1930's. Well... that's a bit of an exaggeration, but what I mean is that I was bored to death. My problem was that while I was waiting for the mystery to build, I was left with characters whom I couldn't build a connection to and didn't care about. When the mystery picked back up, I was totally absorbed again though. Never before have I read a book that has blind sided me with jaw dropping revelations as this book has. So glad I pushed through and read this book. I had to rate this book 4 stars because I am still in awe over how rocked my world was when certain things were revealed in the book. So refreshing it is to read something that isn't predictable!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The timer feature is my favorite part. Great for listening at bed time. The sound selection is also good and being able to layer them and adjust volumes on each is really nice.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|I found the disturbing nature of Adeline very interesting, the parts of the book that described the twins as children was page turning. I would have liked more of a twisted ending. I wasn't really expecting a happy ending for this story and having Vida Winter's just die wasn't enough of a punch for me. I had my hopes built up for some jaw dropping ending and I was disappointed. I found Margaret very boring, and hated the parts of the book where we left Vida Winter's story to talk about Margaret's life.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|You could taste, smell, and see the elements described in this book in a way that was almost poetic at times. It was a little darker that I was ready for, but what should you expect with a book called the \\"Night Circus.\\"

B006888EXI|2.0|I've been waiting a long time for \\"Electric Dreams\\" to come to DVD so I was delighted to find it available.  However, when I loaded it on my DVD player, I was disappointed to find that the picture began to \\"roll\\" like the old \\"vertical\\" adjustments on the old style TVs.  This was common in the early days with black and white TVs but extremely uncommon with the modern flat screens and there is no adjustment to correct it (at least I don't know of one...) I was able to get it to work on my desktop computer and this was the only reason I didn't return it.  I don't know how this movie was copied onto DVD but there needs to me greater care to guarantee that the product performs as expected.  Great movie but a big disappointment with the performance of the DVD
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read this book on vacation and could hardly put it down.  Love the twist and turns the book takes and the fresh storyline. really liked it. purchased first book by author, not as thrilled yet.

B004KBSQOW|5.0|If you haven't ever heard his version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, you are missing something!  I have put this CD in my car stereo and played it repeatedly.  Some of the songs are Hawaiian, so not as easy to sing along to, but I often like to hear songs sung in other languages. Overall, this is a very soothing and upbeat album.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|OMG this book (and series) is one of the best reads I have had in a long time. I love a great story but love a great series too. This is well worth the read. Some very good writing and descriptive terms. I loved every page enough to find it hard to put down. Have since bought the DVD series and love love love it.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I am probably a bit older than the demographic this album is aimed at (age 59) but I had heard some samples of her music on NPR and decided to buy the album.  I have played it repeatedly and really like it.  I really like new music and am not someone who has much interest in the \\"oldies\\" when there are so many young, talented musicians out there!  Do yourself a favor and check out this artist!

0812992784|5.0|Salman Rushdie's memoir of, predominantly, the fatwa years is completely gripping - albeit not necessarily in the way the author intended I suspect. For any lover of literature it's a fascinating insight into the man. People write memoirs largely to put their side of the story. Rushdie is of course supremely intelligent and a gifted wordsmith and yet while aspects of the story remain shocking and induce both anger and incredulity that the situation was allowed to go as far as it did and for so long, it's probably not a book that will change your views of Rushdie the man, not least as he displays many of the traits that the press ascribed to him. Oh why do our heroes always have to be so imperfect?<br /><br />Usually people referring to themselves in the third person is guaranteed to irritate me, although here the story is told entirely in the third person. The title \\"Joseph Anton\\" is the name he chose when asked to provide a pseudonym for the security services. As a result the book reads as much more like a novel and it works well.<br /><br />To try to impose some structure on this review of what is a lengthy tome, let's look at three key elements: the \\"crime\\", the \\"punishment\\" and the \\"perpetrator\\".<br /><br />He fails to address any intent or otherwise in the apparently inflammatory content of \\"The Satanic Verses\\". If you have read the book in question, you'll know that the allegedly offending content is minimal to the overall book's structure. It's not much more than a dream sequence. Certainly it would be hard to argue that the book as a whole is an attack on Islam. And yet of course, this is exactly what happened. Did he know what sort of reaction this might evoke? Perhaps as that oxymoronic thing, a secular Muslim, he ought to have done but we never really get to the bottom of this. He even complains later in the book when the media continue to ask the questions about intent. Yes, that's because you never answered the question. Once accused, he goes straight into Voltaire mode to defend his right to say it.<br /><br />The sense I got from reading it is that he was as surprised as anyone by the reaction, and his point that if a work of literary fiction such as \\"The Satanic Verses\\" is deemed that threatening to a major religion, then it has fundamental problems is well made. In my memory, it was Ayatollah Khomeini who started the problem with the fatwa but here he explains that there were Islamic protests before that. Khomeini admitted to not having read the book and it's hard to imagine that any of the protesters really had either. If he isn't goint to address motive or otherwise in this lengthy memoir then I guess we'll never know.<br /><br />In the \\"punishment\\" content of the book, Rushdie is at his eloquent best. It's clear that to a great extent he was a victim of political posturing. Khomeini himself was probably using it as a political cause, but more difficult to reconcile is the lack of support from the British government to state sponsored terrorism who were probably slow to respond for fear of derailing hostage negotiations over the likes of Terry Waite. There's something of a \\"James Bond\\" fascination to learn about the inner working of the security \\"prot\\" team who mostly come over as the good guys in all of this. While you could argue that the freedom of expression arguments are not difficult to make, Rushdie makes them powerfully and given his situation, movingly. There are also superb moments of typically Rushdie-esque black humour such as his first trip to the US during the fatwa period.<br /><br />What makes the book so compelling though are the sometimes jaw dropping revelations about Rushdie the man. Rushdie repeatedly laments that his image remains unsympathetic certainly amongst the British press (who he terms \\"The Daily Insult\\"), and often expresses frustration that he just wants to be loved. In fairness, there's probably much of the migrant's wish to be accepted as much as loved. And this is at the heart of things: whatever you think of Rushdie's work or indeed Rushdie the man, to Western eyes the Iranian fatwa was wholly unacceptable. The British like nothing better than an underdog, and yet despite both these things, public sympathy for his plight has been surprisingly antagonistic. You'd expect his memoir to alter this view. This remember is a man who once worked in advertising. It doesn't.<br /><br />He cites many good friends who indeed go to extraordinary lengths to help him out but there's a difference between how those who know him respond to him and those who don't. He attributes much of his lack of sympathetic image to the press, both the tabloids and the \\"Independent\\" who seem to have it in for him. And yet, he displays many of the characteristics that probably belie this image. He can be arrogant, he can be extremely hypocritical and is quite spiteful to anyone who crosses his path. He also comes over as extremely sensitive to criticism but is quick to hand it out. To illustrate this, at one point he reviews books, gets shocked that writers who are his friends object to his analysis of their books, and swears off doing any further reviews. A few pages later, he's back reviewing again.<br /><br />The reader can always tell who is going to be on his side because they are always, always introduced with the adjectivally limited term \\"great\\". This lack of descriptive range is surprising for a man of Rushdie's descriptive powers and gets, frankly unintentionally comic. He comes over as something of a literary luvee. This might be due to the sad restrictions placed on his movements by the fatwa, but probably not.<br /><br />And then we come to his relationships with women. At the start of the fatwa, he had only one ex-wife. By the end of the book, he had increased this to four, at least two of which are presented as madly dysfunctional. It's hard to believe the fault is all on one side though and to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to marry one bonkers person is unfortunate, two looks like carelessness. Consider for example that his first contact with what was to become his third wife was on the telephone discussing watering a parrot, on the basis of which he went out and bought three bottles of wine for their first face to face encounter. That's not normal.<br /><br />These then are the conundrums of Rushdie: a man whose fiction is about inclusion and cultural integration has his creative and personal life disrupted by cultural conflict; and a man who has a supreme  understanding of personality in his fiction can be so divisive in his own interactions in ways he does not recognize. That aspects of his character are flawed seems clear, but of course that doesn't make any of the things that happened to him any more just. They do though make for a gripping memoir.

B0085A9J18|4.0|Heard a lot about this movie prior to purchasing it and was not sure if I wanted to read (sub titles) a movie. In this case though it was completely worth it. This movie has action, decent dialog (reading), ACTION and incredible martial arts. Oh did I say ACTION yet?<br /><br />though the plot is not the best they do it well. some of the fights sequences are typical martial arts but in many caes the moves are out of this world and some of the fastest you will see in a modern movie.<br /><br />I gave this 4.5 stars out of five but could not get the star chart to match. if a person loves martial arts movies they will totally enjoy this one as well.

Many from my high school served in the military and the special forces.<br /><br />Professionalism, effectiveness and valor are the three terms I would use to describe our service people's performance on a daily basis both in their professional and personal lives.<br /><br />All of us owe our service people not only a debt of gratitude for protecting us from the tyrants and animals, of which there is a never ending supply, we owe it to them to ensure that the politicians don't short change them on their salary, living conditions, equipment and benefits and divert the funds into various vote buying programs and pork for the connected of both parties. Cell phones for votes while the soldiers are laid off comes to mind.<br /><br />I thank the makers of this movie for minimizing all of the hot-dog and psycho episodes prevalent in so many military movies and not portraying the officers as disconnected boobs, they are not. The few that are ineffective, incompetent or detached from their reports don't last too long in uniform.<br /><br />I have never met or known a better class of people than our service members.<br /><br />While this film focuses on the SEALS, lets not forget the 6,000 plus service members who have died and the 25,000 wounded from all branches of the military in the current conflict with religious fascism, worse than the Nazis if that is possible.<br /><br />In short; mostly realistic portrayal of the character and effectiveness of our military.
1451695195|5.0|Do not be dissuaded by critics of this book. Dr. Alexander's credentials make it the most authoritative report on near-death experiences yet published among more than twenty-two million NDEs worldwide. Yet religious fundamentalists and materialist scientists still disavow the reality of the author's experience. The innumerable details about the author's life add significance to his experience, so read the entire book. By then, your eyes should be moistened. Recognize, too, that Dr. Alexander recruited many other people to provide the book's periodic information that he could not have remembered. This allows readers to realize the depth of his crisis and to grasp the anxiety among family members and fellow health professionals. To fully appreciate Dr. Alexander's book, imagine that you have a companion consciousness capable of such a near-death experience because it is unrestricted by death of your human body. But this other consciousness likely adopts your attitudes and beliefs, so your NDE may be different from Dr. Alexander's. Maybe the kind of NDE we experience is one that best assures us of Heaven. I believe that our \\"companion consciousness\\" is our soul, unfettered by earthly restraints. If necessary for clarification, consult the referenced book. [...]

B005S9ELQ2|5.0|Argo's message is a clarion call to solve difficult problems without going to war. Like my father used to say when I was a kid: \\"USE YOUR BRAINS!\\" That's exactly what the main hero of Argo does! He uses his brains to solve a very complex problem in the real world!<br /><br />I can only imagine what would happen had Iran invaded our embassy in 2012 instead of 1979 and held 50 Americans hostage for 444 days! We would be at war and all the hostage would be dead by now. But Jimmy Carter practiced what he preached - and as a consequence - untold thousands of lives were saved by not going to war with Iran even though it cost him his re-election!<br /><br />For those who are ignorant about geography, Iran is larger than the state of Alaska! In other words, about as large as the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany COMBINED! Tehran,the capitol has population the same as New York City, which is about 8 million! The entire country is 75 million, which is about twice the population of California. According to the Composite Index of National Capability, Iran has the 15th most powerful military in the world! So all you warmongers salivating at going to war with Iran keep in mind we will be fighting the equivalent of two California's simultaneously - with one of the most powerful militaries on earth! I hope you're planing to send your sons, daughters and get a second mortgage on your house to fight a war of this magnitude!<br /><br />All I can say is to everyone involved with Argo from President Jimmy Carter to Ben Affleck is THANK YOU! Argo is a shining example of the power of cooperation and creativity over force and stupidity!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:0061844705 Patriot of Persia: Muhammad Mossadegh and a Tragic Anglo-American Coup]] and [[ASIN:1591842425 Problem Solving 101: A Simple Book for Smart People]] and [[ASIN:1107670314 Congress and the Politics of Problem Solving]]
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I ordered this as a replacement to an old N52 that has gotten damaged over the years and I've been very disappointed.<br /><br />First off, the keys on this are large and oddly arranged.  I'd say that I have slightly smaller than average hands, but many of the keys are simply out of reach from a resting position.  I even have to stretch my fingers to reach the WASD keys!  The keys on the edges and bottom require me to lift my hand up to reach.  (And if I'm moving my hands around to reach keys what's the point of a dedicated gaming keypad?)  The thumb buttons are also poorly positioned.<br /><br />The real deal-breaker though is the software.  I got this to play with guild wars 2... but after installing the software I discovered that none of my keybindings worked whatsoever.  After searching through help files and forums I discovered that you have to install legacy drivers to make it work in GW2.  No problem.  I downloaded the older drivers only to discover that the LCD screen rapidly switches through settings with the older drivers rendering it useless.<br /><br />Now I have an uncomfortable input device without a working screen.  I've had it for about 2 weeks now and I've completely abandoned it.

After this review I will be purchasing a Sharp Objects! Dark Places pulls you in from the start and has you trying to solve the mystery at the same time as Libby. It goes from making you sad to horrified to intrigued all in the same chapter. Definitely a page turner that will keep you reading until you finally give in to your responsible conscience thats telling you it's 2am and u have work in a few hours :)

B009AMALLM|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />If horror franchise history 101 has taught me one thing, it's that usually the franchises start getting long in the tooth after the third movie. The only franchise I've seen an exception with that was the Friday the 13th series, where part IV was where the series became watchable. And be it no surprise that something like Paranormal Activity is something that manages to rake in money with every installment every year. The series before it that held the same claim to fame was the Saw franchise. And what do both of these have in common? Both peaked at the third movie. Sadly, Paranormal Activity is quickly becoming the new Saw franchise, something I've feared since before the second movie came out.<br /><br />Yet, in a way, it makes more sense to drag the Paranormal franchise out than the Saw franchise. With Saw, Jigsaw died in the third movie, and we got a bunch of ridiculous whodunits, all amounting to some silly twist that read like a fanfic, with Dr. Gordon filling in for Jigsaw. Here, there hasn't been any silly twists, since the series has made things more apparent with every movie about the origin of the demon, and even the idea of a satanic cult was interesting. I liked it when they brought it up in the third movie. Problem is, we're on the fourth movie in the series now and really nothing has been done with it. I mean, yes, I could complain that the movie has repeated the same formula over and over again, but more on that later.<br /><br />Having broken out of the sequel with a prequel formula, Paranormal 4 starts with a scene near the end of the second movie, where Katie and Hunter are sitting with Kristi by the side of the backyard pool, and she gives him a bracelet. Then a series of obligatory title cards, in the same typewriter font as the previous movies, explain what has happened so far. Right, as if we, the people who saw every movie in the series, needs to be explained to why and what happened. Then, we get the ending of the second movie, with Katie killing Kristi, running off with Hunter, and maybe a 2 second shot that's completely new, where Katie walks out of the house with Hunter, and that same title card explaining how their whereabouts remain unknown. Already we're 3 minutes into the movie and we haven't got any new material... is the series really this out of ideas?<br /><br />Anyways. We go to November 2011, in Henderson, Nevada. We're focused on a new family, whose last name for some reason remains unknown. The mom and dad haven't talked to each other a lot lately, and are on the verge of divorce. The daughter is a very beautiful and happy 15 year old with a cool boyfriend, who may be the only interesting character in this movie. Furthermore, they have an adopted 6-year-old named Wyatt, who's parents remain unknown. They've been receiving mysterious visits from a creepy kid named Robbie, including an unwelcome visit in the family treehouse, and when an accident happens with his mom, he is forced to stay three days at their house. The boyfriend of Alex, the daughter, points out that the XBOX Kinect projects dots that are only visible on night vision video cams, that track movement. This was a gimmick I was hoping would work, kinda like the oscillating fan in the third movie, but sadly, it only served useful maybe once.<br /><br />And so in the first night of his staying there, Alex hears a noise downstairs at 3 AM, and finds Robbie standing creepily in front of the Kinect. Some mysterious ghost, who runs behind him and shakes the house, appears, and this compels the boyfriend, who is tech savvy, to set up the family's laptops in places around the house, and leave them open, as apparently they can record video even when they're turned off. This was something else I was hoping would do some good, but really, it didn't.<br /><br />So, really nothing happens for this time period, but for a few things. One unexpected (but not really scary) moment is when a chandelier mysteriously drops from the ceiling, and Alex, holding the camera, pans the camera up to find Robbie sitting there, watching and staring in silence. Another moment is when a knife manages to disappear in one scene, and then, in another scene, falls down in front of the camera, startling the dad in the family. And there's Katie's appearances, which are good fun and Featherston, as expected, turns in a great performance as Ktie who is now completely possessed by the demon. There's one good jump scare in the scene at the end, where Alex finds a demonic coven, then turns to find Demonic Katie launching for her. Mind you, we had to sit through 80 minutes of same old same old to get to that part, which is never a good sign.<br /><br />By this point, it should become blazingly obvious what happens, even if you haven't seen the first four movies. Which is the problem- this movie is one big, long prologue into the fifth movie. Nothing is done to advance the films plot, and by that, I mean NOTHING. Even Katie's appearances and the twist ending involving Wyatt, do absolutely nothing to further the movie's plot.<br /><br />So maybe the movie really isn't as bad as I may make it sound. It's an OKAY film, if you're a die-hard fan if the series. I'll admit, I have seen worse. But since we've gotten four movies into the franchise, two being done by Henry Joost and Ariel Schumann, who both did a great job with the third movie (many because they had some documentary experience with fan favourite \\"Catfish\\", which got lots of praise from critics and audience alike), and using the same formula, Oren Peli seems to not know where he's going with this series. Hell, the formula from the third movie is repeated here. And believe me, it's an even more stale version of the ending from Paranormal 3. In fact, I kid you not, as soon as the credits came up, the audience booed at the film. That's a definite clue that the series has nowhere to go but forward, with the same formula under its belt, but even less scares than the original. Furthermore, the series has even sunk to the level of using jump scares and CG. the low budget first movie had one jump scare and no CG, 2 and 3 had maybe 2 or 3 with a small dash of CG. CG is everywhere in this movie and it's unintentionally hilarious (does Tobey REALLY look like an alien?)<br /><br />From an acting standpoint, the film isn't bad per se. Katie Featherston is predictably great, and the boyfriend is great too. Reading his IMDb bio, I noticed that he's been in theatre since the fourth grade, just like me. So its definitely not a surprise he can act. From an aesthetic standpoint is where the movie fails. I saw the movie in IMAX, and it's baffling why it even got an IMAX release. Alright, the sound was great but more on that later. The movie's shots can be divided into two categories: fuzzy, webcam style shots and shots of Alex's face. And Alex is a pretty girl and all, but we don't get enough of her parents either, which is a rarity for the franchise. From the third movie, Dennis was a fun character and the mother was funny, though bitchy. And the mother and father here uninteresting because WE SEE SO LITTLE OF THEM.<br /><br />It's worth a note that Robbie isn't all that scary either. Kids get a bad rap In horror movies nowadays and it's not hard to figure out why. Robbie is kinda creepy in his first appearance in the tree house, but after that he isn't creepy at all. He confuses creepy stares with bored droning facial expressions, and seems like a little kid who is crabby because he can't get that toy he wants.<br /><br />So, finally, a word to Oren Peli. Stop this madness now! LET THIS THING DIE HERE. And perhaps fire the screenwriter, Christopher Landon, with it. Or at least find someone who can do something with Paranormal 5, since it hasn't even been two days since the movie came out and already you have announced the fifth movie. I'm sure super special edition 4 disc directors cut blu-ray release with a holographic slipcase cover and a ticket to Paranormal Activity 5 will have all the special deleted scenes and alternate endings, but at this point, I don't even care anymore. This movie is by no means a classic, and while I may have seen worse, it's only a matter of time before this franchise devolved even further into Saw-itude.belt, but even less scares than the original.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|I saw the show listed on the 'tv worth watching' website.  it's the first show i've really watched in 10 years.  It is gripping and makes you want more. It does have sexual nudity, which I wasn't expecting, so I wouldn't watch it with my kids around.

B005R2PDL2|5.0|This is a great CD for listening, meditation, energy work, or any group event. Deva Premal's voice is magnificent and the entire CD is a treat to listen to anytime.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games Trilogy. I have gotten my husband into reading the series and I can't wait until all of the movies are done. I would loved more books like these to be written.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I love games put out by big fish and this was no different.  Had a few spots where I got lost, but over all lots of fun!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of Rick Riordan's best! He did an amazing job with the story. A book I want to read again and again!
B001F12J48|2.0|This is what I imagine a bad bootleg copy would look like.  Even wearing the included 3-D glasses, the picture was blurry and all the color disappeared to almost just black and white.  We have other 3-D movies that work perfectly.  This one was simply awful.
B001NTXHU2|5.0|This is the original lineup. Late great Sandy Denny on vocals, Dave Swarbrick on fiddle and mandolin, Dave Pegg on bass, Simon Nicol on guitar and Dave Mattacks on drums. You won't find those credits on your bloody MP3 download. You won't find any credits unless you google them. That's what sucks about downloads. No album notes. Anyway this is a groundbreaking LP by a band that is still gigging despite  multiple personnel  changes over the years. Catch the original.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like everything about evernote especially making checklists. If I had a criticism it would be that most of the add on program's are for apple products only.<br />Beyond that very few programs can help you stay organized as well as this one.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in You is an easy read. It is great for when you want to turn your brain off and get lost in a book. There is a lot of sex and adult content. If you are a prude you will not like this book.
B007M45PMU|5.0|More people need to listen to The Lumineers. It seems that I can listen to this album regardless of my mood. A good combination of upbeat and mellow songs.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book. Well written, great characters. You just don't want to put it down.
B0081BU42O|5.0|I enjoyed this culture novel very much.  Interesting what happens when an equiv tech level warship goes up against a culture vessel.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|This is not a calendar or anything like it.  You need another calendar for this to work.  What a waste of money.<br />No way to get money back.  Gone.<br />This information should be stated up front.<br />Don't waste your money.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|maybe it's just me but this game needs instructions. The guys at Rovio went alittle overboard with this game. Maybe I will like it when someone explains how to play it:(
0525958002|4.0|I have been waiting for John to write his memoir since I started following his writing at his now defunct blog Trust the Process. For those familiar with his bloggings there and at his band's website, we are not surprised that this is an understated manuscipt. He has never been one to air others' dirty laundry. We have Andy Taylor's memoir and the countless previous publications that have the excess of the 80s, the gritty details of the 1984 tour including John's self-destructive behavior, the band's implosion and finally its reunion. There was no need for Taylor to rehash those events. For those looking for a restrospect about Duran Duran may be disappointed by this book. The memoir is John's and his alone. And it his understated, quiet--dare I say shy--personality that permeates through. He himself admits in the book he has never been one for the limelight of centerstage and that even reflects in this book. I can understand why he did not include more of his own daughter in the memoir. She's coming of age herself and he is not only respecting her privacy but letting her ulitmately be the one to tell her own story. On the other hand, he does a fantastic job sharing his relationship with his parents with his readers. The book starts with them and ends with them. It is obvious they kept him grounded, cared for him during his lows and he was able to reverse those roles at the end of Jack and Jean's lives. The 80s weren't easy, and John Taylor shows that while that era bowed him, it hardly broke him. An excellent glimpse into the journey to true adulthood and maturity.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This was my first experience from ordering movies through Amazon. The process was EASY and convenient. I was able to download 8 episodes of my favorite TV show (Downton Abbey) onto my iPad so that I could watch them from the airport and my hotel room. A little planning on the early end made my trip more enjoyable. The only reason that I didn't give it a five star review is that I can't download onto my Mac Computer. That would only allow streaming. The download worked just fine though.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good book! Hopefully movie will be released in 2013. So excited to see who plays the characters of Ana and Christian! This movie must be rated R or NR!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game is only fun until the coins run out, which happens too quickly. I think there's option to purchase more coins. Definately will not keep kids entertained for too long. This game lasts about as long as a commercial break!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|maybe not exotic but very charming, funny with pathos-great acting & relevant! the filming made you feel like you were there in that chaos but chaos with charisma. it was the best exotic in their dreams!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|dowloaded this on my kindle fire for my kids to play one boring rainy night. Of course, I find myself hooked! It's a great challenging game for kids and adults.
0525952926|5.0|great book, good history lesson. enjoyed reading  this book, could not put it down. as with the first book. Can't wait for the next one....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! Steamy, hot, and keeps you wanting more! The suspense of the book keeps you interested! I couldnt put it down!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Downside: It's addictive. You think you'll try just one more time to hit those smug pigs. Two hours later, your legs are cramped and your back hurts from not moving an inch.<br /><br />Upside: The backgrounds grab your interest, and the creators made the birds and pigs very humorous and humanlike.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! So glad I didn't have to buy the paperback books. I got the trilogy on my Kindle Fire and can't put it down! I charge it every day just to make sure I'll never run out of power to keep reading!
B00138GY5I|5.0|love this album. definately one of my favorite cake albums with a lot of favorite songs. nothing much else to say about it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it such a HUGE help. Its free and helpful. Its a must have big time. Very good download.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After the first part(printed edition), I bought the ebook on the same day I finished reading the first book. I realy identified myself with Anastasia. The book is realy breathtaking, but I felt that the second book should be the last.
B005FJ7F7M|5.0|Apocalypse, vampires, and road movie all in one. Nick Damici gives a strong turn as the enigimatic Mister. This movie is a worthy addition to any collection.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game. it reminds me of the old carnivals I used to visit. they had these games and I used to play them all the time.
B009B50QOU|2.0|I didn't feel this album was up to par with the last two I have from Green Day.  There is one great song but the rest are not ones I would listen to a second time.  Better to save your money and just download \\"Oh Love\\" and leave the rest alone.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it is ok. I would say it is ok. not great but ok. not awful but certainly ok. yup indeed. ok
0143058177|4.0|I don't know how many times I've read this novel. Lately, I've listened to it on audio books and read along every evening. Sometimes I would jump ahead and then re-read that section. It was so fun...I know it sounds a little odd. I bought a used copy because I have several others, unfound upon quick glance,  scattered about the house. Nice, comfortable copy.
B008PC1GF8|5.0|Terminus, the god of boundaries and ends, is my favourite Roman deity. Whenever I hear this celebrated performance of the Eighth, I wonder whether it is a Canticle in his honour.<br /><br />In keeping with the sentiment above, rather than bumbling my way through a review, let's defer to Horace:<br /><br />\\"Dead to all shame, I left my household gods; now<br />Shameless again, I keep Death waiting. O hear me,<br />Some god in heaven, and sentence me to walk stripped<br />Naked among wild beasts . . . While the victim is still tender, let my beauty bleed on the tiger's tooth.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Come, my last love, for here I reach the end<br />Of Loving, and no woman shall excite me<br />Ever again - come, learn this air<br />And sing it to delight me<br />A good song can repair<br />The ravages inflicted by black care.\\"<br /><br />One more recording was to follow: the Bruckner Seventh with the Vienna Philharmonic but it sounds post-coital from the first bar. In fealty to Terminus, Karajan should have stopped here.<br /><br />You'll find more things of heaven and earth in this performance of the Eighth than a million dusty sermons. It by no means displaces Karajan's stupendous 1944 recording (yes, the first movement is missing but the finale is in glorious stereo and Karajan adds another four minutes to it [[ASIN:B000001SUN Bruckner: Symphony No. 8 in C minor]]) but it runs it damned close like no other does.<br /><br />DG's Original Image Bit Processing has been around since 1995. In its first phase it consisted of transfers to a 20-bit platform. It is now 24-bit. Across the series, DG promises 'Added Presence and Brilliance - Greater Spatial Definition'. While the hype does not always live up to reality (eg, [[ASIN:B000001GQ6 Bruckner: Die 3 Messen/Masses Nos. 1-3/Les Messes]] is a worse transfer than the old white & gold box), it is applicable here. The November 1988 recording was fabulous for its time. In this revamp, it is demonstration class and beyond.<br /><br />Reach for the skies !<br /><br />Reach for the skies !
B0091THRCU|5.0|Finally got my wife to let me get her an iPhone. I like cases that the phone slides in and out of so you can protect the front and back of the phone. Protecting the front and back allows you to resell the phone for more than a scratched phone. This case is well built, nice soft leather and the phone fits snug, but not too tight.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and my club is currently reading this book preparing to discuss it in November.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|A very useful and beneficial app. Great for accessing ebay on the go. Some features maybe aren't perfect but for free this is great
B0087HT36U|5.0|What I like most about this game is the challenge of getting the gold crown. Then, going back to do the treasure levels. Someone really put some thought into this game!!
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|Most boring movie I've ever watched. Couldn't get through the whole thing despite some fast forwards. I think slavery was a crime but still this movie was way overhyped.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It has assisted my use of my Kindle Fire greatly by keeping it charged.  It is like the one I got for my prior Kindle 2.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Another classic that is definitely worth a read.  Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading.  Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was really stubborn and didn't want to be another hunger games zombie but after the movie came out I decided I should probably read it, because I really like reading the books before seeing the movies. I bought it for my Ipad and kept putting off starting it but finally it was my last book on my ipad so I started it. I LOVED it. I read it in like a day and that was with me working a 12 hour shift. It has the perfect mix of action and romance to satisfy and girl or guy. You need to read it !!! Be prepared to buy all three books because you will need them as soon as you finish the first one.
B000063V8T|5.0|I bought the 5th season ST TNG mainly because of this episode ( The Inner Light). The DVD's were all in really good condition and except for a few minor scratches on a couple of the DVD's, they were all very clean. None of them had reading errors anyway.<br /><br />Also, I got them on time and one day before I left for work overseas.<br /><br />A good buy, for sure!
0761158820|5.0|I got this for my daughter and her friend to fill any rainy days at the cottage.  They loved it but found a couple of the models a little too complicated.  That's where I came in to help (I was just waiting for the chance to join in...) and I had a great time too.  I saw this book at my local art supply store and it was twice the price, so this is a real deal.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed at the movies and couldn't wait to get into my video library.  This is one I'll watch whenever I need a laugh along with action.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Rowlings should stick to Harry Potter and fantasy.  The writing was very convoluted and hard to follow.  I was disappointed because she had done such wonderful works with the Potter series and I was looking forward to something totally new and exciting.  Try again J.K. !
B003BW0CB6|4.0|The Reversal by Michael Conley, was fascinating, fast paced and believable. It kept me reading late into the night.  The interaction between characters was great.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its convenient to know what your battery reserve is especially when you don't have your power cord and you need to make it last for the day.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a fun ongoing game that even if you run out if stuff you can come back in a few hours and keep playing.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Loved the story and the life message. Wish more people would \\"get it\\". This might help open the eyes of those that don't stop to really appreciate what is truly important in life.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I expected this movie to be a bit silly, and it was, but the longer I watched, the less amused I was. The plotline is uninspired, the dialogue is terrible, and the acting is mediocre at best. These aren't characters, they're caricatures.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Prometheus does not fit neatly into any one film genre.  It is part science fiction, part fantasy, largely a talky drama, a suspenseful thriller and a philosophical study.  It is choppy at times but still entertaining.  It is not a prequel but a mirror of a prequel in that it introduces one into the universe that later spawns the alien menace.  The director does ring in Weylund Industries, the moon-like celestial system that the Nostromo will later investigate, the race that made the Alien, and the concept of invincibility and eternal youth and strength.  Overall, it is an interesting idea but it will need more films to fully develop the concept and to bring us up to the Nostromo story.  The folks hear tried to outdo themselves and instead have now created an unfinished story.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is to fun I mean it and guess what it is free!!!!!!&iexcl;!!! man I am not kidding. it is w2wwwwwwwwwwwwwww2wwwwww some
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Awesome movie... A must watch for the Alien fans of this world... It's mysterious yet it's also scary at the same time.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is a stunning movie and this is the best format I've ever seen it in. A quality tune up for a classic actioner, this is a great one for the blu ray.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have been a huge kiss fan since 1976 and i must say this is the heaviest album they have made since revenge. Monster is the album that makes kiss who they are and i say if you buy this album you will NOT regret it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A blu ray tune up for classic sci fi can be amazing. The Aliens movies look great here, and the sound is perfect. A great package. If you want another top notch sci fi restoration, check out [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]]], which looks incredible.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like this game I cant play too many hidden objects on my kindle fire so I was really happy when I found this one
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I'd read and enjoyed Fall of Giants so I was looking forward to Winter of the World. What a disappointment for me. The characters were flat and one dimensional. There were silly errors such as calling the Washington baseball team the Nats when in the 1940's they were the Senators. It looks like a rush job, poorly written and poorly edited. If you really want to buy this book, wait a bit. I'm sure it will be remaindered soon. As for volume 3, I'll wait for readers reviews and go to the library if they say it's worth the effort.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Awesome a well done homage to the original with the Tim Burton touch it deserves, the entire cast of actors where sublime. The heart of Dan Curtis's creation was captured with a little cheek to boot! Love it!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I really like this app, the free version is fine, but it's worth the $2 for the full version.  No advertisements, and some nice features that I find very helpful.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good read. I enljoyed reading it all though there were a lot of unexpected turns to this story. I was hoping for a different outcome..
1469984202|5.0|I read the omnibus edition with all 5 Wool books together, and it was a good thing becaue once I got going I couldn't put it down. I love this old-school science fiction story about a dystopian world where everything is underground. I am blown away by Howey's imagination and originality.  The future world is scary-realistic. I am glad that all of the likeable characters didn't die.
034580404X|4.0|Love that all three book are together. Ordering the Trilogy allows you to finish one book and then pick the next one up and continue reading without interuption of waiting for the next book to be recieved.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I had been using this app on my droid incredible for many months, and I was a big fan. However, I haven't been able to use it on my new galaxy s3 Verizon. Not sure what the problem is.

0151013047|4.0|It is almost as revealing to read some of the commentary on \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" as to have read the brief novel by Mohsin Hamid and while attempting to discount or even ignore some of the more ethnocentric responses, I think the variety of interpretations points to a book that can be read on many different levels. In fact, all books involve a process of translation, even those in a language with which we feel fluent. We read a book differently based on how we are responding to life & what we know about the setting of the novel at a given moment. Often rereading a book after a number of years becomes akin to reading it for the 1st time. I found this to be true when rereading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" after a period of many years since the initial reading, feeling that the book had been somehow rewritten, ignoring for the moment that it was I who had changed and not F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel.<br /><br />For me, at its core, the Mohsin Hamid novel deals with the process of developing one's identity, causing other things in the novel to become almost incidental, at least at times. To criticize someone for not being fully mature at age 22, of not having done a better job of assimiliating two very different cultures, of having seemed to reject America or the blessings of a Princeton education is to miss a great deal that is important within the book, at least in my opinion. Changez is a man in flux & given the circumstances of his life, attempting to straddle two countries while not forsaking one in favor or the other, is never easy. In fact, he reminded me of an early novel by Saul Bellow, \\"Dangling Man\\", whose main character of about the same age as Changez is also caught up in a crisis of identity, allowing himself to be drafted into the U.S. Army because he is no longer able to deal with the complex variables of his life. Such things do happen and particularly at the age of Changez in the Hamid story.<br /><br />With all of the blessings that come with life in America, being allowed to come to this country, whether from Pakistan, Jamaica or Burkina Faso, is like winning the lottery, at least as viewed by many in the rest of the world. And many who win the lottery find it an experience more difficult to deal with than ever imagined, almost like needing to enter a witness protection program, taking on an altered identity because their former identity is suddenly in dynamic transition. Having lived abroad in a Third World country for a few years in the 1960s, at a time when the U.S. was experiencing dramatic changes, I can attest to how one's identity gradually shifts to take on characteristics of the place where one is living at that time. This is not to become anti-American but to begin to see the rest of the world through a very different lens. Hence, I think Changez can abhor the death & devastation that came with the attacks on the Twin Towers and elsewhere in America while at the same time experiencing at least a slight feeling that some of the arrogance he perceives in the way the U.S. occasionally deals with the rest of the world has been responded to. The people of other countries can and do in fact both revere and feel intimidated by the United States and these countering emotions do not cancel each other out.<br /><br />It seemed that Erica is going through a crisis of identity as well as Changez, as her identity was so rooted to her lifelong friend, the recently deceased Chris. Meanwhile, Changez seems to define himself in some ways by his experience of Erica, a relationship that can can never be more than an incomplete one. Erica vanishes without a trace, with not even a farewell note, even leaving her discarded clothes behind and I think that is important to the story in an odd sort of way, leaving what ultimately becomes of both somewhat obscure. Having mentioned the author Fitzgerald, it is almost reminiscent of Jay Gatsby's having longed to tie his consciousness to Daisy Buchanan, a seemingly romantic but rather incomplete & underdeveloped vision of his ideal woman. For the erstwhile Mr. Gatz, Daisy seemed almost as unknowable as Erica did to Changez.<br /><br />Changez may appear reluctant but he is not a fundamentalist in either a religious or a political sense of the word. If anything, he is secular & apolitical but I think remains open to the world at large, not being ready to cast himself in stone at the age of 22. Hamid's book is not a great novel but it is a good one, a book that provokes one to ask more questions rather than to provide stock answers. For many of us, this is the reason we travel and one of the reasons we read.
B007RI56NY|3.0|I'm a big fan of Train, and while this album has several great tracks (This'll Be My Year comes to mind, along with the two singles), overall it came up a bit short for me. Still enjoyed it though, and I'm looking forward to their next record.
B008NABUU8|5.0|found myself doing mental math. the difficulty may depend on how many physics and engineering classes you've taken. the loads were slow and the game didn't take kindly to pressing the sleep button, but it was still delightful to play. wish there were more levels.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app! just wish we had a weather station closer. We live in Buford<br />Wyoming. Need a station at the summit.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I hope to see more movies with this much focus on not only the character but their alter ego as well.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Really good show, fun to watch and reminds me of the fairy tale movies I watched as a kid.  Highly recommend
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very well thought out, challenging and very fun. even my 5yr old is enjoying playing and giving me plenty of assistance!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome app the best one I have ever played. Mindcraft is amazing don't listen to anyone below 5 stars. Amazing app.
B0098WWEH8|4.0|After hearing tidbits of this new album performed lived on the local radio station I knew I had to buy it and it is every bit as good as I imagined. The music has a different energy than the band's last album, more upbeat perhaps, and a little less melancholy. All in all a great entry in the band's discography.
1451695195|5.0|I'm still reading it, but I'm so excited, I have to encourage everyone to read this account of a near death experience. Affirmation of what I've heard before, but in a more concrete way. It's not just that God is Love, he says love and compassion compose the very fabric of the spiritual realm. In addition, we are being observed as to our spiritual growth - we should strive for spiritual growth. Reaffirms to me the power of prayer. It's not just a way to make myself feel better - it has actual power for other souls. Blessings!
B002RI90WM|5.0|I loved this book.  A friend recommended it to me and I am so grateful to her. I am a fairly new dog owner and she has opened up such a loyal and welcoming world to me after the death of my beloved husband. Enzo, the doggy narrator of this book, is wise beyond words and his reflections on the human world were often humbling. I laughed out loud in places and cried in other parts but the whole story just went to prove that our lives are enriched by our four footed friends, and vice versa.

B003UYUP58|5.0|This was a wonderful, page turning history of cancer.  It's science was accurate and up to date.  In the historical sections was fascinating information and many details I did not know.  When teaching biology, I wish I had known more on the cell theory to make it more exciting.  The details of cancer treatment were frightening, and I am glad we live in a less brutal time.  The presentation of modern cancer discoveries was enlightening - making me wish my biochemistry background was more up to date.  A true page turner.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really didn't want this to end, and I hope there will be more. I am not a scifi fan, but I have recently been interested in the dystopian genre, which led me to this book. I will admit I skimmed over a lot of the technical stuff, but the interpersonal relationships and plot kept me enthralled. I plan to check out more from this author for sure.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The writing is so perfect! it grabs you and keeps you all the way!! sometimes you feel ashamed, hurt, happy, excited, scared every emotion is in this book
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't say enough! I love everything about this book,   from the story line  to the hot and steamy details. A must read!
0761171703|5.0|Dancers Among Us is a project few would tackle. Jordan Matter is obliviously a passionate photographer. The passion transfers into every image. The dancers where outstanding professionals. They had to trust Jordan with every click of the shutter. WOW! What a great achievement.
0316228532|2.0|This is a story where the most likable character in the book dies in the very beginning and then the provincial town where he lived proceeds to fall apart like a slow motion train wreck. The End. That's it. Don't bother.
B00351YEZS|4.0|Reading 'A Briefer History of Time' made me reset my mind about perceiving time as we know it, or as we think we know it. This maybe sounds a little bit cryptic, but I can't put it in other words. Stephen Hawking has the ability to write extremely technical and scientific material in a manner that novel-readers can grasp and could even follow as a thriller. I can highly recommend this book to people who don't want to waste time reading!
B008WCP2KG|1.0|You cannot download this into iTunes. While the movie is OK, the problem is Warner Brothers consistent strategy to provide digital copies through Ultraviolet. Cheapness beats quality every time. Ultraviolet replied to my question as to how to move to iTunes this time with a \\"NO\\". In the past they offered methods of downloading the file into iTunes. This time \\"NO\\" was the answer from their support. Let WB know if you are displeased with this.

B005LAIHYU|4.0|The whole premise behind ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is so preposterous, you can't be expected to take it seriously...and that's why it works as a fantasy using historical figures and events as its backdrop.  All the elements of an action/horror film are here:  stunning special effects, outlandish kung-fu fights, breathtaking set pieces and a noble hero in Honest Abe.  It's impossible to resist the movie's lure in spite of its incredible storyline.<br />Benjamin Walker, looking like a young Liam Neeson (he ironically played a young Neeson in KINSEY), brings a naievete and sensitivity to his role of Lincoln.  Mary Elizabeth Winsted is a glowing Mary Todd Lincoln and Anthony Mackie is fine as Lincoln's childhood friend.  Rufus Sewell is evil incarnate as the head vampire.  Only Dominic Cooper as Abe's mentor seems ineffective in a one-note performance.<br />Go in with an open mind without expecting historical accuracy and you may enjoy this film for what it is---a bloody good horror flick.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is exceptionally well written and is told from a unique perspective, however it left me ruined for a few days. It's the sort of book that makes you fall in love then rips your heart out and leaves you not knowing which way is up... But maybe that was just me.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Cute story about a centurian's adventures through the 20th century and how the famous characters he meets along the way.
1455527475|5.0|The book's lack of sensationalism speaks to the author's integrity. I am amazed by his descriptions of what goes on in the world of finance and that these anecdotes aren't shocking to so many!? That is the real story here. Anderson Cooper compared Mr Smith's speaking out with \\"Fight Club\\" where rule #1 is that no-one talks about what happens in Fight Club. If there is a club that's handling my/our money, I want to know what goes on in it! It takes a brave man to do what Mr Smith has done.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. It was much better than the first. The story was much more complete and interesting and while still looking like 50 Shades of Grey, there are clear differences. Very good.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was so excited to read this story I pre-ordered the book. I read it cover to cover within the first day. As someone who has epilepsy, I have recently been seeking out different perspectives on the matter of consciousness and what it means to be \\"awake\\" and in a \\"normal state\\" given the complexity and inspiring moments of my seizures. The story itself was enlightening and highly educational though I must agree with another review that the details on his actual experience are rather scarce. I don't know if my expectations were to high at the outset or if that is a legitimate complaint. For a title like \\"Proof of Heaven\\" I think there will many readers who are eager to read and learn as much as possible about what the experience of heaven is like and will feel just a touch let down that there wasn't more. I do think though that no matter how much description the author gave, the human appetite for some assurance we will know EXACTLY where we are going and EXACTLY what it is like will never be satiated.<br /><br />From a scientific standpoint, my heart goes out to the author on his journey to appeal to his peers. As a former biochemistry student and as someone who has many highly educated, atheistic friends I know first hand how difficult it is to converse openly about unconventional theories (especially where consciousness and theology are involved). I shudder to think of the abuse he will take within the scientific community. I do love that he incorporated, albeit briefly, quantum theory. Another book i read, \\"Quantum Physics, Near Death Experiences, Eternal Consciousness, Religion and the Human Soul\\" by William Joseph Bray actually took on this subject very well, though the author lapsed a bit kooky here and there. Nevertheless William Bray managed to bring up very compelling logic on the mechanical nature of our universe and the role of consciousness within it. In the future I hope that Mr. Eben Alexander and other great minds will be able to convince the scientific community to give credence to these important experiences and to use them to further our understanding of the fabric of reality.ic community to give credence to these important experiences and to use them to further our understanding of the fabric of reality.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|How exciting is it to open a package and enjoy the contents of it....well, if you order a Lego Death Star, you'll experience it.<br />I bought this for myself but opened it up with my niece and nephew and they were totally excited.<br />Even though they know they won't be working on it, they enjoyed checking out the packaging, counting the number of minifigures we get etc<br /><br />One of the best excitements of our week :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game ; keeps the kids occupied in the car for hours. I think some of the games are hard or maybe the right word is frustrating!! Those are the ones I hand off to the kids. They're better at them than me. All in all,  it's a great game and fun too!
