0316017922|5.0|Always an influential thinker, Malcolm Gladwell ensures - yet again - that we looks at things beyond the obvious. In this book, he explores whether success - as we define it - is only a function of individual merit and plain luck?<br /><br />Well, throw in the 10,000 hour rule of practice required before you even explore 'greatness', he says. Add a dollop of 'practical intelligence' viz. knowing what to say to whom and when and how. And how about the importance of just being born at the right time? You arrive in this world too early and you are excluded from opportunity. You arrive too late & the field is already crowded. In some instances, even being born in January/Feb ensures you have more opportunity than if you were born in Nov / Dec.<br /><br />Gladwell then explores how your ethnic background shapes how you turn up later in life. The dogged persistence in some Asian countries (and longer school hours) translates into how children start doing well in math. South Korea's attitude towards hierarchy had an influence how its pilots communicated between one another and ground control while airborne and played a role in some higher-than-usual plane crashes involving Korean Air.<br /><br />On the whole, you come out looking at success with an altogether different perspective.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I wish this was out in time for Mother's Day!  As the mom of a 7 year old girl with autism I was so struck by the courage of Temple and her mom.  I could relate to the fear her mom had about making the right choices for her daughter.  I cannot imagine what it would have been like back then.  It is not easy now, but so much better because of the courageousness of these two women and others like them.  I believe this movie is an inspiration to any mom or teacher who may wonder if her (or his) hard work really makes a difference in the world.

B001HN6940|1.0|I can't help but wondering why Tim Burton decided to turn the funny, illogic, surrealistic, symbolic tale of Alice into the most boring, standard, predictable, a-thousand-times-seen story. It is obvious that he only cares about the visuals, but that results into a boring movie, because the \\"plot\\" (so to speak) is utterly uninteresting. Lucky I watched it on 3D, as a 2D movie it would be twice as flat. Needless to say I will not purchase it, I couldn't stand this movie more than once, honestly. To me, it is the second great fiasco of Tim Burton's after the equally unbearable \\"Planet of the apes\\".

B00005JMJG|5.0|Viewing this for the second time, I was even more impressed.<br />With almost 700 reviews already on this movie, I have little to add. But it does what so few modern movies do -- engages both the viewer's intellect and feelings. The way it is constructed is brilliantly clever but all the tricks and technical marvels are really in service of a touching love story -- and the idea that love can survive even our technological society -- even the loss of memory.<br />Wonderful acting -- by far the best performance of Carrey's career, Winslet is charming and the secondary characters are also brilliant.
1438509480|5.0|I first read the meditations when I was 18 and just out of highschool. Four years later the stoic philosophy of Marcus Aurelius has led me to following my dreams and sparked a passion for classical literature and history that I never had before.     A few of my favorite quotes:    \\"Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.\\" -- Live for the moment, because tomorrow is not gaurenteed today.    \\"Put away your books and face the matter itself\\" -- Don't rely on self help gurus, and books like \\"The Secret\\" to solve your problems for you. Analyze it yourself, and come up with your own unique solution.     \\"Remember that very little is needed to make a happy life.\\" -- Money isn't everything.    These and many other philosophic truths have gotten me through what had to have been the toughest chapter of my life so far.
B002361MLA|1.0|I read a dozen of these books when I was in my late teens. This version regurgitates the bulk of its ideas from Zen Buddhism with a splash of Taoism. Like rows of other books it says meditation can be beneficial, harboring destructive emotions can manifest itself in lots of ugly ways, finding a peace within can create tangible outer benefits....<br /><br />I'm not surprised that some people would love this book and benefit from reading it in the same way opportune timing can match a lonely man with someone to love, a friend can take a drunk to an AA meeting or a priest can offer meaning to someone in the throws of helplessness but it doesn't change the fact that the totality of new ideas would only fill a pamphlet.<br /><br />There are plenty of truths in this book and some people gain confidence in their own insights when they see those ideas in print but the practical benefit anyone might derive from this book will only ever be their own acceptance and appreciation of that which they already know and have.

1563898586|1.0|I only have one complaint of this book, but it's big enough to knock four stars off the rating. It's extremely, *yawn*, boring. There's not much else to say; like it seems most of the reviewers here have, I've read Alan Moore's other work. Watchmen and Promethea both changed the way I looked at things, Promethea especially (the artwork and layout are beyond beautiful). But this dull piece of garbage is only filled with grey, or light brown, panels and slow, *yawn*, rambling, dross dialogue that I can only imagine the dullest of people enjoying. But still, Promethea is out of this world, even if this comic is chained to this one.
B0000683DH|4.0|I have tio admit one thing before I begin:  I am in any way, shape or form a audio/video/DvD/Blu-Ray/video game freak so I cannot and WILL NOT comment on the actual production qualities of this DVD.  I don't care about how much they clean up the sound and remix it, or if it sounds better in Dolby Digital or DTS, or if the picture looks grainy or what not ( as long as it looks good ), and God knows what else.  I go the movie theaters to sit down for 2 hours, watch an enjoyable film and then I pass judgement on it and if I enjoy it or not I will remember it.  Being a long-time fan of the Star Trek series I recently watched this film on Netflix after not having seen it in over 10 years, and I think this Star Trek flim, the best of the series, only gets better with age.  Nothing about this flim could be better insofar as the Star Trek universe is concerned, and of course the late great Ibero-Latino actor Ricardo Montalban was the standout.  So on to my review, and this is just a character study, and I won't give away the film to those who HAVEN\\"T seen it:<br /><br />  After spending more than 15 years in exile on a planet known as Seti-Alpha 5, the great \\" gentically modified Superman from the late 20th century \\", a former warlord and prince of late 20th century Earth, the villanous Khan ( played by the late great superbly famous and well-respected Ricardo Montalban, God please preserve him and keep his soul safe ) is able to extract revenge upon the hero of the Star Trek universe, the legendary revered and lauded greatest Captian of the United federation of Planets, Captain James T. ( Tiberius ) kirk.  He, of course, does not succeed but this film emphasises and illustrates the great havoc and tragedy the great sin \\" wrath \\" can wreak upon a person's soul and the people it is directed at.<br /><br />  Khan, a megalomanical madman who was a lesser version of Adolf Hitler in his own time, was awakened out of his cryogenic bedchamber along with members of the crew of ship 15 years earlier by Captian Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise, all of whom are in this movie.  Through the course of that episode of the origial \\" Star Trek \\" series, which I can recall bits and pieces of, Khan tried to commandeer the Enterprise and kill the crew but was stopped and ultimately defeated.  Kirk, being a just man and not prone to the violent and sadistic tendencies of a man like Khan, chose to exile him and his crew on a lush, green, fertile planet known as Seti-Alpha 5 and thought that that was the last he would ever hear of him.  Since Seti-Alpha 5 had so much going for it as a planet, Khan accepted, brought along his crew and also brought along his girlfriend, a very beautiful crewmember of the Enterprise, who had fallen in love with him and most likely later became his wife ( to whom he was referring to early in the movie, which was most likely the key component fueling his hatred towards Captian Kirk ).<br /><br />  15 years later Khan was discovered BY ACCIDENT on planet thought to be Seti-Alpha 6 by a Federation vessel and that's when Khan's wrath broke loose.  The ensuing cat-and-mouse game was a true game of human chess to watch unfold on the screen and Khan's venemous hatred could be felt even across the screen ( the mark of a truly great actor, the ability to elicit emotions in the crowd.  Actors who have perfected their craft are able to do such things well, they are like charges of electricity.  Some are more intense than others, some you don't feel at all.  Ricardo Montalban was a great actor. )<br /><br />  Captian Kirk, belng a wily and crafty man, was trying desperetely to keep up with his opponent and was doing well, but he was aided in great part by his best friend, occasional opponent, mentor and almost half-brother the alien from the planet Vulcan, Spock ( played by Leonard Nimoy ).  Without Spock's guidance it would be easy to surmise that the games between Kirk and Khan would have reached a fever pitch and the ensuing clash would have resulted in the destruction of many lives, but the sacrifices we make \\" are for the good of the many \\".  And thus, tragedy ensued and carried over into the next 2 Star Trek flims.  Star Trek 2:  The Warth of Khan was really the first part of a 3-story arc that culminated in Star Trek 4.  You cannot watch this film and not watch the other 2 because they are bital in knowing how this story reached it's culmination.<br /><br />  Star Trek is an institution that has inspired generations of people to look beyond the limits of the Earth and themselves and ask themselves questions about their lives, the Earth, the world around them, and ultimately what it heams to be alive, and more specifically, human.  Forget the negative connotations people have about Star Trek fans, the much ridculted and lampooned \\" Trekkies \\", becauae those are the people who have true enlightenment and will look forward to the cosmos and keep the shining light of the human race burning forever, if we can learn to get along like the citizens of the United Federation of Planets do.  We don't have to be friends, one big happy family, or even like each other, but like the Star Trek universe the world is large and everybody can prosper in their own natural environments if they don't have the constraints that people who would like to oppress others, such as Khan, would like to impose upon others.  that's why the United States of America should NEVER, EVER ABANDON IT'S SPACE PROGRAM AND LET IT BE DEVELOPED BY NATIONS THAT ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS.  SUPPORT OUR AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND KEEP AMERICA STRONG AND ALWAYS LOOKING SKYWARD INTO THE HEAVENS.

B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Not as good as the original, but still a fun movie.  Imagery is good.
B0027BOL4G|2.0|My wife and I sat down to watch this movie, expecting to learn some new things about food production and expecting to be shocked by how bad things have gotten. However, we both agreed afterwards that the movie was actually pretty boring. It just didn't have that \\"pop\\" that I expect from a good documentary. I wasn't horrified by the conditions in the various slaughterhouses, I wasn't surprised that a big company like Monsanto would find a way to protect their intellectual property rights, I wasn't surprised that corn is in a lot of foods. What I was surprised by, though, was that the insane and environmentally INCORRECT use of corn to make ethanol wasn't even brought up when they talked about corn. Why wasn't that even mentioned? Using corn to make ethanol has raised the price of food, is worse for the environment than just plain gas when a spill occurs, and in the long run does more harm than good to our environment.<br /><br />I also have the book and am hoping that the book is better than the movie. I expected that after seeing this, I'd want to change my eating habits, but it didn't have that effect on me at all. maybe the book will.<br /><br />Something else that was strange was that they seemed to play down the fact that e. coli comes from human and animal excrement.<br /><br />If I were giving the movie a letter grade, it would be a C-minus.
0452289963|5.0|An excellent presentation that shows the spiritual practice as the more vital treasure then the religious practice. A must-read.
B003BVK2ZS|5.0|As I read this book I had the constant nagging in the back of my mind that the author was inappropriately glorifying the thefts perpetrated by John Gilkey, the book thief.  I was relieved that near the end of the book she kicks him off his self-created pedestal and pretty much exposes him for who he really is - a very narcissistic person with serious moral issues.  Gilkey reminds me in many ways of Roger Clemens and Pete Rose, two premier athletes who refuse to recognize their own wrong-doing, one taking steroids and the other gambling on baseball (although Rose finally admitted his guilt in an effort to get himself into the Hall of Fame).  In similar fashion, Gilkey takes absolutely no responsibility for his thefts and instead blames the system, which unjustly keeps him from acquiring books for which he has, in his mind, a true appreciation.  It is not love that he has for books but rather an infatuation that is fueled by the belief that owning these rare and precious books will reflect on him as a person of letters.    Ken Sanders is the book dealer who has taken it upon himself to catch Gilkey and stop his thefts.  Sanders is an engaging character as are most of the other book dealers interviewed.  Bartlett adeptly brings the reader into the passion-filled world that is book collecting, including some of the more bizarre actions taken by bibliomaniacs to acquire their collections.  The book is also a walk through the history of book collecting and necessarily deals with some of literature's major works, as they relate to book collecting. In addition, Bartlett ties in the powerful meaning books have for regular readers and collectors alike, as they contain within them more than just the literary content, but also the personal stories of those who owned them and the circumstances through which they came to possess them.  There is a final and touching paean to collectors, who by their efforts have in many ways kept alive culture and history as it is preserved in books.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I love the movie, I'd give the full version four and a half stars. But this isn't the movie I saw at the megaplex. This isn't close. I don't mind that it isn't 3D. I do mind that they shaved off some bits that modified the story line slightly. Unless I slept through it they took out the nookie, now I didn't need to see blue folks getting it on, but the mating made them a pair and that was supposed to be for her and the guy who would become king. So when she chose the tiny alien she really messed up the tribal politics... and that was cut.     I'm not going to be suckered in to buying every version of this. So instead I'll mark this down to experience and put it on my list of movies to buy when 3D is sorted out on TVs and they my flat screen is worth replacing.     I doubt anyone will ever read this warning, but I should still try.

0061922315|4.0|This book was a delight to read.  I have a special interest in stories and memoirs about individuals who search for their roots, so I knew this book would hold my interest.  What I wasn't prepared for was the multiple story lines that wove together so beautifully to create an experience of the entire family's growth through the process of adoption.  First of all is the story of Asha, the young girl who was given up in love by her natural mother to ensure her survival in a poverty situation that didn't value female infants.  There is the story of Kavita, the natural mother, who mourns her loss.  There is the story of Somer, the adoptive mother, who struggles between her deep love for her daughter and her feelings of alienation in a culture that is so foreign to her.  There is the story of Krishnan, the adoptive father who struggles between his desire to experience all that his adoptive country has to offer and the pulls to the culture he has left behind in India.  And there is the story of Dadima, Asha's adoptive grandmother, who more than anyone accepts and draws Asha toward wholeness.  A beautiful story of love, family and culture.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Alright, maybe not *completely* typical, but everything you'd expect from a love story can be found in Serendipity.    A man and woman strongly believe they are destined to be together, but because of a completely silly elevator incident (you'll understand what I mean when you see it) they never actually meet up, and eventually go their separate ways.  This is honestly a pretty poor piece of writing and totally unbelievable, but whatever.    Years later, they realize they want to be together and can't stop thinking about each other... but the thing is, BOTH the man and woman are already in relationships with someone else, and to make things even more complicated, they completely lost touch with each other and can't find each other.    Through some miraculous and hard to believe twist of fate, weird things eventually happen to both of them (such as clues that were left from when the two of them were together for that short time before the *ahem* elevator incident).      These \\"weird things\\" (in other words, spoilers) encourage the two of them to eventually find each other, but it seems wherever the man searches and believes he's about to find the woman of his dreams, he *just* misses her (and vice versa).   This is basically the storyline for most of the film.    Well, not much I can say except if you like love stories, this is definitely a movie for you.

B003FSTN5C|5.0|Where the original NCIS was a welcome respite from the utterly idiotic inaccuracies of JAG, this too is a welcome respite from the original's flaws such as Gibbs' perpetual crankiness, Tony's overgrown fratboy routine, and Ziva's perpetual inability to get an idiomatic expression correct.  Now the focus shifts from forensics procedural to buddy-cop action with NCIS's LA-based Office of Special Projects black-bag unit, who are far more upbeat and quirkier.  The action largely follows deep-cover agent G. Callen, who doesn't even know what his own first name is, and ex-Navy SEAL Sam Hanna, with occasional help from resident cool chick Kensi Bly.  Even their boss Hetty is a lively individual with her own idiosyncrasies.  It's a welcome return to fun cop shows after about a decade of dragged-out police procedural.
B00004R99U|1.0|Pocahontas is probably my second favorite Disney film, following the Lion King.  As a complete Disney fanatic, I love all the movies but usually don't like the sequels much.  The only sequel worth watching is The Lion King 2. Anyway, this movie is so completely awful it makes me want to throw up.  First, the animation is obviously not up to the standards of the real classics.  Secondly, the story and plot line are so bad that I am now trying to forget that someone ever thought up such a horrible sequel to such a beautiful movie.  I would like to meet them and ask them what they were smoking.  Everything about Pocahontas 2 was terrible and an embarrasment to the Disney company.  I think they should recall this movie and destroy every copy, so as to rid the earth of this terrible tragedy and restore respect people had for Disney movies before this mess was created.  Seriously, if you are thinking of watching or buying this, don't.  It very well may ruin Pocahontas for you or ruin your life.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Who doesn't know who Elvis Presley is?  EVERYONE knows who he is!      What was never officially done was make a perfect compilation album giving us every single one of his very best moments.  At least, one hasn't been made *this* extensively.      Elv1s 30 #1 Hits is an *awesome* compilation.  The song selection is almost entirely right on the money.  This is the album people need to be playing 100 years from now to remember all the kings greatest moments.    This is a perfect collection of songs that lasts almost 80 minutes (so the entire disc is filled up).    I highly recommend this brilliant collection.
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Slash does not disappoint on his first solo album to fill the void during the hopefully temporary downtime of Velvet Revolver. This album is full of really good songs--actually, some are just OK, others are great! A lot of it, not surprisingly, sounds like Velvet Revolver. I guess this CD could be called Vocalist Revolver--lol. An impressive array of vocal talent, no doubt! The sound quality is killer, with Slash's legendary Les Paul roar shining through!    For me, the weakest track is \\"Saint is a Sinner Too\\"--pretty boring. A couple more are kind of pop-rock oriented. But the rest are pretty much straight-ahead hard rock with Slash's burning guitar leads featured throughout! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0553582038|2.0|The Song of Ice and Fire started out with a bang, giving me hopes that a modern author might equal the likes of Tolkien.  But AFFC turned out to be a total let-down, sinking the series from potential classic to a never-ending marathon that you wish had never begun.      As the series title would imply, the story is supposed to be about ice (short for the evil creatures raising havoc in the north) and fire (the dragons), but neither dragons nor northern evil spirits get any real attention in the book.  It seems GRRM has lost interest in actually telling a story, preferring to introduce a never-ending stream of characters, who criss-cross the same lands without any apparent purpose.
B00275EGWY|3.0|As an avid fan of war movies, I found The Hurt Locker a big disappointment.  The action was too slow and the entire movie was focused on only one thing -- the disarming or detonation of IUDs.  The only scene of interest was the suicide bomber who changed his mind and the resulting consequence.  I think the only reason this won Best Picture was due to the sympathy for the current war.
B000B8QF14|3.0|Hi,  I like Green Day. Don't get me wrong. Plus, I know this was a big tour for them. Billy Joe said so himself. He said it was the best tour in the sixteen years they've been together. The thing is. After sixteen years, I would expect better musicianship out of them. The main example of that? The pathetic \\"Solos\\" barely worthy of the name. Only the bassist & drummer tried to do one. The solos were nothing more than a few bars of filler, in the middle of songs. I appreciate that they're not musicians' musicians, but I was amazed. Green Day is a club band, a dance band. Green Day is not a polished, evolved band. One whose music has grown w/them over the years. Musically, I expected a lot more from them @this point. Sad, but true. Yeah, I know. Many here will retort that they're laughing all the way to the bank. That proves nothing. Many people are still stupid enough to buy Fords, Dodges, & (Gag) Chevies... Heck, you can even find AC/DC still \\"Touring\\" somewhere. The late Eighties/early Nineties were a long time ago in the music industry.     As for the DVD. It's the only thing that saves this package. You can see them shine in their natural element. Club bands are meant to be heard & seen LIVE. Too bad the editor chose to cut in interviews after almost EVERY freakin' song.... In all honesty, I think Green Day's better days are well behind them. I think they might want to stop before it gets worse. I wish them well.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Visually, I had no complaints. Unconverted onto my 720p, the original Star Wars looked beautiful and was exactly what I was looking for. My TV even had a special screen size selection that made the 4:3 widescreen a lot more liveable, but that is something to consider if you don't have as many \\"zoom\\" selections. The biggest drawback was the audio quality which was pretty sad, due to its lack of digital processing (or any form of processing for that matter). For me, it's worth it to see the original untouched visuals from the original trilogy, but if you don't have a copy of the movie score, you might be a little disappointed in hearing that orchestra screech its way through low-quality sampling. Worth it for me!
B002UNMWAG|3.0|THE MOVIE IS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE AND THE ACTING IS JUST AS BAD! From Julie Benz who played Dexter's wife on the show Dexter on  Showtime who was all soft and sweet in that, to a hard ass  sexy detective with a really bad southern accent in this flick. The action is ok, but the rest of the movie i really fell asleep to. So i watched it again and it was just as bad as me nodding off the first time! The plot is pretty weak, The acting is horrible including the seasoned actors, This movie isn't worth buying, its better to redbox it with a promo!  GOOD LUCK

B002VPE1B6|4.0|Has anyone not seen James Cameron's juggernaut?  Is it worth seeing on DVD or Blu-ray?  Even though the film is now officially the highest grossing movie of all time (approaching $3B!), there are millions upon millions who have not seen it - in America and abroad.  And yes, the magic still works in 2-D, especially with a high-definition TV displaying a Blu-ray disc.  That said, this film is an otherwise lame, highly derivative story but executed in eye-popping, breakthrough technology.  Essentially, it's a blatant homage (rip-off?) of Sam Fuller's Run of the Arrow, which was ripped by Dances with Wolves, Fern Gulley, Disney's Pocahontas, Last Samurai, Cabeza de Vaca and a host of lesser films and stories.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest source influence on Cameron was Poul Anderson's 1957 short story \\"Call me Joe.\\"  It's about a paraplegic who telepathically connects with a synthetic life form to explore a harsh planet.  Sound familiar?  And regarding the prime visual influences, who does not recognize the iconic \\"YES\\" album art of Roger Dean in the floating rock mountains of Pandora? In November, a director's cut extended edition (with substantial additional footage) will be released just in time for holiday gift giving opportunities.  And then, later in 2011, a \\"true\\" (not two color shift) 3-D edition is planned.  For now, the bare bones Blu-ray with no extras will have to do.  Almost 2 million Blu-ray copies were sold in the first weekend, breaking the hi-def home video record set by The Dark Knight. From 20th Century Fox. (2009, PG-13, Widescreen (not 3-D), 162 Minutes)

B002P6TA94|5.0|This album is excelent! One of the most powerful bands of this decade, Wolfmother is a suprise for who listen to their music! Their style is a condensed sound of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and The Beatles!!! One of my favorite bands, one of my favorite album!
0393307050|5.0|My father recommended this book to me a few years ago, he's British and to this day a member of a sailing club.  Back then, I gave up around 10 pages in, deciding that enjoying the book required extensive knowledge of sailing and the British navy.  I just finished the book after trying it for a second time and I plan to read the entire set of Aubrey/Maturin novels.  Here are some reasons for nautically challenged readers to try Master and Commander.         The characters are real.  I can see Captain Aubrey on the deck of his ship right now and I can hear the Doctors internal monologue, analyzing something esoteric yet fascinating.  Their companionship propels the story forward and makes it relate to anyone.     The story is captivating.  The pages fly by as the world of Aubrey and Maturin sucks you in.  The off beat charm and unpredictable nature of the book make it difficult to put down.      The writing is excellent.  Superb, in fact.  I expected dry and convoluted, instead, I got wit, subtlety, and easy to follow naval terminology.  O'Brian's turn of phrase is wonderful and I literally re-read some sentences because the humor was so unexpected and clever.  Note: I've read a lot of reviews by people saying that they couldn't understand the sailing terminology or the book.  I thought that too before I read it.  No research is required for this book.  Just read it and get used to the lingo.  It doesn't matter if you don't know a mainsail from a topsail or whatever.  The book is driven by the characters and the events not by the exact number of guns there are on a frigate.        Anyone who enjoys reading should give this book a try.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Its a good movie, especially for young people.  It is an alternate reality of what was lost when this country was settled, by mostly white people.  The indigenous people were in touch with the environment, and had a very nice way of living with nature, unfortunately, as has been our nature, from the beginning of recorded history, we are a people of adapt or parish.  I'm not making any judgements on which lifestyle is better, but I wouldn't want to give up my flush toilet, hot showers, and air travel, none of which would exist if we weren't a people of adaptation.  So why only one star and the title rent it?  Because as many reviewers have already said \\" wheres the special features?\\"  Why a dvd version as part of the package?  To justify the price, to suck you in to thinking it was more then it really was.  Word is the full version is coming out within a few months and then yet another 3D version will be following that, probably just in time for Christmas!  So rent it now if you haven't seen it or borrowing it from you relatives or friends would be even better.  When they finally know what their doing, and it's in 3D, I think most people will really enjoy this, just don't try to analyze it, its more fun watching it as escapism, a beautiful reality if only fantasy world, you can't miss the comparisons, so over look them.  Ain't nobody going to know, unless you write a review, and with a thousand reviews already, dose anyone need another?  But if you wouldn't mind, I could use a little help with rating this 1 star.  Lets send a message to hollywood were sick of getting ripped off and their hypocrisy about saving the environment while they force us to buy three or four versions of the same thing in the name of their profit potential.

B0030IIZ56|5.0|I like the DVD/blue ray combo pack of the toy story movies.  We do not have a blu ray player yet, but we have watched the dvd and it is still a great movie.  Once we get a blu ray player we will be watching the blue ray.  It will be great to take the dvd on trips this summer to watch on the portable dvd player.

B0030IIYWA|5.0|I love toy story, so I was excited to own it when it came out on dvd again.  It is a great version, and it is nice to see it in high definition.  It's the same great movie.  I like the idea of the blu-ray combo packs.  We will for sure be watching it in our portable dvd player this summer on vacation.   We have not watched the blu-ray yet, but I'm sure it will be the same great movie.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I didn't see this movie in the theater. What prompted me to buy AVATAR was ALL the hype about it's ACADEMY AWARD nominations. After seeing AVATAR, I'm not surprised how it FARED at the CEREMONY. Some of the story lines I had seen in other productions. For example when the flying creatures were pared up [for life] with riders, the selection process was very similar to the pilot of \\"DINOTOPIA\\"!    Well it's in my library now and probably won't be watched again unless I lend it to someone. I'm NOT saying DON'T SEE IT, I AM saying RENT IT FIRST!!!!!!

B00361HV02|5.0|This CD is the latest in a string of really good music produced by the band.  They blend indie, rock, and blues through out the CD without losing their own sound.  For classic rock fans you can compare them to the Rolling Stones, not in how they  sound, but in the fact that they can play a variety of styles of music without losing   their identity and at a consistently high level.
0393072231|5.0|Lewis does it again. Through the eyes of a few guys who figured it out and bet against it, he dissects the inner workings of the US mortgage bond debacle.  His explanations of CDO's and CDS's are intuitive and succinct, just enough to allow the general reader an understanding of what this toxic mess was composed of.  He is always entertaining, informative, and just fun. Read it.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Exceptional visual entertianment. Great and humorous story. This is a movie that will please kids and adults alike. Blu-Ray image is superb
B000683VI4|4.0|I loved the scene near the beginning where Noah hangs by one hand high up on the ferris wheel, refusing to grab on with his other hand until Allie agrees to go out with him. Obviously I don't want my boys to copy that behavior (nor do I want them copying other behaviors shown in the movie, such as laying down in the middle of an intersection) but there is a desperate passion on display here and throughout the movie. Near the end of the movie we see the inside of the notebook, where Allie has written, \\"Read this to me, and I'll come back to you.\\" I think this is a good analogy with God's \\"notebook,\\" the Bible, where I can imagine God saying to us, \\"Read this from me, and you'll come back to me.\\"
B001LMU182|4.0|This Blu-Ray isn't much better than the DVD that I've had for many years.  Some scenes may appear to be sharper on Blu-Ray, but some scenes are better on the DVD.  So, since there is an inconsistency of the improved quality of the film, I see no reason to buy the Blu-Ray version.  I borrowed my nephew's version to compare because the store I saw it at wanted over $35 for the Blu-Ray.  But, I've learned by watching them both, side by side, that my DVD version is just as good.<br /><br />You know, my previous Samsung Progressive scan DVD player with the HDMI hook-up option, really made my old DVD's look better than my first DVD player did, anyway.  So, if your DVD player has the HDMI hook-up, you're going to find that replacing your DVD's with Blu-Ray may not impress you with any visual improvements that you'd be hoping for.  Although, I have discover that some Blu-Ray releases have shown a greater re-mastering effort, but only because the DVD version wasn't mastered very well in the first place.  I've got some great looking DVD's.  I don't think it will be necessary to replace them with Blu-Ray unless they sell for maybe $10 or less.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but I wasn't impressed.  Besides, I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I will only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less, and if it is a great movie.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be very selective of how I buy Blu-Ray discs.  I've bought just 30 BD discs in the past year and I just bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  I just wasn't that anxious to buy a Blu-ray disc player although I know I've bought some Blu-Ray discs where I'd like to someday see a better quality picture of a film that I truly enjoy..  When I eventually bought about 24 Blu-Ray discs, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  But, I must maintain spending discipline on my Blu-Ray disc expenses!  It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.  Because, before you know it, they will eventually come out with something better than Blu-ray, like 1500p resolution.  You know, that's not too far-fetched to imagine.  Blu-Ray is simply not the end to improved video quality.  I hope you all know that.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47\\" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32\\" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47\\" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.and I just bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.

B0033QC0WY|5.0|I consider this the best single Mahler collection available, because it is rehearsed and conducted by Leonard Bernstein, whose life and passion brought about a worldwide appreciation for Mahler's music.<br /><br />Bernstein appeared transfixed or transported to another world when he was conducting Mahler.  He told orchestras that Mahler left the best blueprint--extremely detailed scores--so that all a conductor would need is to follow the score.  But Bernstein then added that his display of emotion was to try to persuade the orchestra and audience to love the music as he did.<br /><br />Special highlights of this collection are a performance of Mahler's 6th that is so transparent that listeners can easily hear the cowbells both in the first and fourth movements.  In Mahler's 2nd there is a wonderful pairing of Christa Ludwig and Barbara Hendricks.  Ludwig appears again in the 3rd with the plaintive, \\"O, Mensch!\\"  The 4th features a boy soprano, Helmut Wittek, in an effort to capture what Mahler intended as a simple, guiless, child's view of heaven.  The \\"cast\\" for the Symphony of a Thousand is likewise impressive and effective.<br /><br />No one could have poured more of his soul and life into Mahler's music than did Lenny.  Because of my love and appreciation for Mahler and for Bernstein, I can't help but believe that Mahler would find Lenny's interpretations inspiring and for all time.  This collection is a box of love letters to the listener from Gustav Mahler and from Lenny.<br /><br />For those who would like a more detailed description of the contents of this collection, here is a listing, all conducted, of course, by Bernstein:<br /><br />Symphony 1  Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra<br /><br />Symphony 2  New York Philharmonic<br />Christa Ludwig, contralto<br />Barbara Hendricks, soprano<br />Joseph Flummerfelt, chorus master<br /><br />Symphony 3  New York Philharmonic<br />New York Choral Artists, Flummerfelt<br />Christa Ludwig, contralto<br />Philip Smith, posthorn<br /><br />Symphony 4  Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra<br />Tolzer Knabenchor<br />Helmujt Wittek, boy soprano<br /><br />Symphony 5  Vienna Philharmonic<br /><br />Symphony 6  Vienna Philharmonic<br /><br />Symphony 7  New York Philharmonic<br /><br />Symphony 8  Konzertvereingung<br />Wiener Staatsopernchor Walter Hagen-Groll<br />Wiener Singverein<br />Wiener Sangerknaben<br />Wiener Philharmoniker<br />Rudolf Scholz, organ<br />Margaret Price, soprano I Magna Peccatrix<br />Judith Blegen, soprano II Una poenitentium<br />Gerti Zeumer, soprano III Mater gloriosa<br />Trudeliese Schmidt, contralto I Mutter Samaritana<br />Agnes Baltsa, contralto II Maria Aegyptiaca<br />Kenneth Riegel, tenor, Doctor Marianus<br />Hermann Prey, baritone, Pater ecstaticus<br />Jose van Dam, bass, Pater profundus<br /><br />Symphony 9  Royal Concertgebouw<br /><br />Symphony 10 Adagio  Wiener Philharmonikeror  Helmujt Wittek, boy soprano    Symphony 5    Vienna Philharmonic    Symphony 6   Vienna Philharmonic    Symphony 7   New York Philharmonic      Symphony 8   Konzertvereingung   Wiener Staatsopernchor Walter Hagen-Groll  Wiener Singverein  Wiener Sangerknaben  Wiener Philharmoniker  Rudolf Scholz, organ  Margaret Price, soprano I Magna Peccatrix  Judith Blegen, soprano II Una poenitentium  Gerti Zeumer, soprano III Mater gloriosa  Trudeliese Schmidt, contralto I Mutter Samaritana  Agnes Baltsa, contralto II Maria Aegyptiaca  Kenneth Riegel, tenor, Doctor Marianus  Hermann Prey, baritone, Pater ecstaticus  Jose van Dam, bass, Pater profundus     Symphony 9   Royal Concertgebouw    Symphony 10 Adagio   Wiener Philharmoniker
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I hadn't seen Avatar in theaters, so I was very excited to be able to watch it at home. I was very disappointed to discover that because of my blu-ray player (which is new and has recently updated firmware), I got a timeline across the bottom of the screen that showed the chapter title and thumbnail picture. If I ignore that glitch, the movie was completely spectacular. The effects are such that the cgi is flawless and appears real, even when in scenes populated by human actors and real objects. The story has been told before, but the new setting of the lush and exotic world of Pandora leads you away from how familiar the tale actually is.     The other disappointment I had was that there were no extra features on this disc. I would have gladly foregone the dvd in the blu-ray/dvd combo for a disc of special features. Having heard that a new set will be released this fall (just in time for Christmas) has me very upset. Clearly, the urge to milk as much money out of the public with multiple bluray/dvd releases of Avatar was just too hard to resist. I'd have waited a bit longer to see the movie, and been willing to spend more than I did for that, but now...meh.  I have the movie and the special features would have been nice, but not enough for me to purchase it all again.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Great movie. All 5 discs are not blu-ray though. The making of documentary and extras disk are standard dvds.  However, the Final Cut disk, Theatrical Versions (both international and american), and work-print version are all remastered on blu-ray. For fans of the movie this is a no brainer to get.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|Per many of the prior reviews buyer beware of fakes. I went after what I thought was a steal on this site & was burned. But, thankfully Amazon A-Z guarantee came through immediately & offset the charge or had the seller do it. Just buy from a \\"known\\" dealer to avaid hassles.....On with the reviews.  4 star rating not for the music or remaster because both are as good as it gets for now. What gripes me is EMI/Capitol/Apple greed. There should have been no box sets. The sets in all cases but 1 should have been issued in mono/stereo & non lp singles & then maybe 2-3 cd set for The White Album. EMI did this with the Hollies (no bonus trax) but excellent sound. Rhino did this with Loves 1st & there is certainly enough room on the cd format. The sound on the 1st 2 lp's is not dramatically different from the '87 versions. Which tells me the mono remasters are not slammed with compression/limiting. On HDN, the bass frequencies have a noticable difference than the 1st two. I dont think the engineers were able to \\"isolate\\" the bass on \\"PPM & With\\" as they were basically cut live to the master with very little over dub. 4 Sale is comparable to the 87 master but sounds fuller in the bass register. Help, Plastic Soul, Revolver, Pepper, MMT, White & Masters truly rule in mono in most cases. There is nothing lacking in the mono where I find myself by the speakers straining to hear a part. The Mono mixes are very clear & powerfull. This set also gives the correct edits & speed on some cuts. The Stereo sounds dilluted in some cases. But,then you really need to be in the \\"sweet spot\\" to hear the stereo mix to really appreciate it. I like stereo when mixed properly. Lead vocals always front & center & then the guitars panned to 1 side. Many early Beatles stereo lp's have the vocals off to 1 side. The mono's on the other hand sound correct where ever you may be positioned relative to your loud speakers. Think of all your favorite motown or 50's records & the impact they made on you. Now put on a mind blowing LP like Pepper or White Album & you will find that mono brings out the very beefy and nasty elements of any good rock or R&B. The Beatles are no exception to this rule. I have a couple of the Stereo remasters & they are fine if not a little louder than the mono counter part but that may be due to added compression in the remaster process. Mono was the \\"gold standard\\" in the UK and the stereo mixes were derived from the mono mixes. Check out the Zombies abbey Rd classic Odessy & Oracle & the Kinks \\"Village Green Preservation\\". Those masterpeices are mono. Be not affraid if you are looking to upgrade your Beatle collection, mono is the way to go. It's too bad the suits at EMI really didnt have the fan in mind when they packaged these pricey sets. I do not intend to \\"upgrade\\" my 1987 stereo collection based on what I have heard thus far.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I want my $20.00 and two hours of my life back.  This was the worst film I have seen in years.  While the special effects were impressive, they were used to the point of rendering them overwhelming and counter productive.  Special effects are supposed to be a bridge between the reality that a film is a work of fiction and the ability of a person to \\"willingly suspend disbelief\\" and invest themselves in the story.  The most important trick with special effects is to give enough to get the audience hooked but leave enough for the imagination so that the audience invests itself into the story.  The special effects in this film were so pervassive and overwhelming as to leave nothing to the imagination so there was no room for the audience to invest itself into the film.  The overwhelming nature of the special efforts made the movie a completely passive experience.    The other problem with this film is that the special efforts were a bridge to nowhere since there was no meaningful story to invest in.  The critics were right to label this movie \\"Dances with Smurfs\\" since it was just a high tech rip off of \\"Dances with Wolves\\" with blue natives.  The characters are two dimensional and utterly predictable.  The story has been done time and again by a Hollywood that has nothing new to offer and instead just recycles the same politically motivated scripts.    The only good thing about this film was the incredible job done with individual special effects but ultimately the audience is so swamped by scene after scene that offers nothing more than a cool visual that by the end of the film you are left thinking \\"Oh God, not another pretty light ...\\" and praying for anything of substance, which unfortunately never, ever materializes.    I want my $20 and two hours back ...
B0035WTE2U|1.0|You've gotta be kidding me. They won't release a greatest hits collection or sell their songs individually on itunes, but they'll recycle some old songs, slap Iron Man on the cover and somehow people are buying this?  This is commercialism at it's finest, can't fault that, but damn if I wouldn't feel dirty all over if I were Angus and had to look at this cartoon character defacing the art I had spent decades pouring my soul into.  Oh well, I guess he washes off all the shame with the stacks of hundreds he's rolling in.  But this is just disgusting!

B000000OAL|2.0|Queen's self-titled debut LP is not like the later releases in the 1970's. It has some piss-poor production issues.  The drums are rough as hell and sound like boxes.  \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" should be re-titled \\"Keep Yourself Awake.\\"  BORING!!!!  \\"My Fairy King\\" is, however, an absolute triumph and a stunning hint at the future.  Besides that, Queen's debut features two killer tracks, both of which are religiously themed.  \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Mad The Swine\\".  Take this example, from the oddly pleasing track \\"Jesus\\"    \\"Then came a man before his feet he fell / Unclean said the leper and rang his bell  Felt the palm of a hand touch his head / Go now go now you're a new man instead  All going down to see the lord jesus....\\"    or this passage from the QUEEN LP's b-side \\"Mad The Swine\\"    \\"I woke up on the water just as before / I'll help the meek and the mild and believers and the blind  And all the creatures great and small / Let me take you to the river without a ford  Oh and then one day you realise / You're all the same we've been in life  All I've come to say just like before.....\\"      Freddie was a man wading in stratofied water:  the hot water his aggressive sexuality;  the cold water his love of God.  This is the thin line that we all walk in life.  I think we owe a lot to Freddie for sharing both his Homosexuality and Christianity.  Most are afraid to even bring it up these days.        Besides that important point about the lyrical content - the awful production, terrible drumming and somewhat weak vocals takes keep this debut down a few notches.  Only buy if you are a big time fan of the band!!!!

Not for young kids or even young teens, but intelligent adults who enjoy fun movies and dry sarcasm should enjoy this movie all the way through.
B002P5XXR0|3.0|It was driving me crazy, I knew I had heard it before....I just knew it. As many reviews here have stated James Horner recycles his music from other movie soundtracks. As I was watching the movie and the mother tree had just fallen part of the dreadfull mood of the music was so familiar but I just couldn't place it. Then it hit me. One of my favorite Christopher Walken movies of all time is Brainstorm, and it just happened to also be scored by James Horner. At least part of the music from that scene is from \\"Lillian's Heart Attack\\" from the Brainstorm movie soundtrack. After doing a little trolling in regards to Mr. Horner I have learned that this is also known as his \\"4 note danger motif\\" and has been used many many times on almost all of his movie soundtracks. I'm not saying it it's bad for this movie...it works for the mood. However I know I will always be listening for the Infamous \\"de de de daaa\\" from now on whenever he scores a film.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Outstanding First Novel from a foreign author.<br /><br />The Kindle version reads well with no formatting issues to speak of.<br /><br />I won't rehash the story for you.

0307271862|3.0|With the relatively recent success of Stieg Larsson's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (and its sequels) in the U.S., a reader might well be steered to other Swedish mystery writers.  Henning Mankell has been producing books longer, but that hasn't necessarily translated to greater success here.  Based on my first Mankell novel, The Man from Beijing, I'd have to say that Larsson is more deserving of the critical and commercial laurels.    The Man from Beijing opens with the murder of nineteen individuals in an isolated Swedish town, most of whom were elderly.  It's a horrendous crime and there are few leads.  Brigitta Roslin, a judge, realizes she has a loose connection to some of the victims; idled from her job while on medical leave for high blood pressure, Roslin starts meddling in the investigation and turns up some interesting information, especially related to a mysterious Chinese man who visited briefly around the time of the killings.    Roslin's probing will create dangers, ones that will magnify when she joins a friend on a trip to China.  In particular, she will get the attention of a very powerful Chinese businessman who somehow ties to the killings.  There are also ties to events that happened over a century ago in America.    For the most part, this is a good book that only falls apart at the end when it becomes apparent what the motive is for the massacre.  It's a pretty feeble and implausible motive and it hurts the story, though not irreparably.  If you can disregard this rather significant flaw, you may enjoy this book.  I, however, expected more from a veteran author.
B0035G9ABQ|2.0|This album at it's best is unremarkable.    Gorillaz first 2 Albums were trendsetting and fantastic to listen to. There were plenty of good grooves, and songs that stood out among the other songs rolling around out there.   This one sucks.    If your favorite songs on previous albums were: Rock the House, The Sounder, Ghost Train, Double Bass, Latin Simone, then you will love this. If your favorite songs were: Feel Good Inc, DARE, Clint Eastwood, 19-2000, Happy Landfill, then you will be lost as to understand where the group who gave you those songs went to.

1400032717|4.0|Many are complaining that Asperger's isn't like how it's portrayed in the book. My cousin is autistic, and he acts just like the kid in the book, so it just shows you how different the condition can show itself.    Anyway, on to the book. I liked the different perspective the book provided. I really started to empathize with the protagonist. The story itself isn't very unique, but that's not the point. It's definitely worth reading, whether you're interested in autism or not.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Tombstone is one of the best western movies I have ever seen done, along with Billy the Kid one and two. I rate this movie 5/5 and I can't wait to buy it on the 30th of April. I recommend this movie all the way.

B00371QQ2U|1.0|I purchased this movie expecting a Blu Ray spectacular since this movie was originally released as a defunked HD-DVD, I thought they would make it even better because of that. I have a Panasonic player with the latest firmware updates and was totally annoyed with the amount of time it took to load. Even after I had selected PLAY MOVIE, I was subjected to even more delays. I'm glad my player is not connected to the internet like many others with complaints about all the extranious junk heaped upon them. If you own the original verson, the up conversion on your Blu Ray player will make the difference in video quality negligible and save you 17 bucks and all the loading problems. Universal. If this junk is an example of your future Blu Ray releases, don't bother.

B00275EGX8|2.0|First of all, I have nothing but the highest respect for our troops no matter where they serve. I rented this movie and I'm glad I did instead of buying. Aside from a lot of good special effects, this movie and it's plot goes little beyond a 2 hour TV mini series or one night special. I am mystified by it's Oscar status as it does not deserve to be on the same DVD shelf with movies like Saving Private Ryan or or any episode from the Combat! TV series from the 60's. I guess the movie industry ain't what it used to be.
B002XTBEDI|2.0|After thoroughly enjoying Cranford, I was quite disappointed with the Return to Cranford. There was too many drastic changes, too many added new characters and not enough of first cast. The story jumped ahead too far and I just felt lost and couldn't get into it.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|This classic, totally outstanding album, first released in 1967 on the Elektra label is, undoubtedly, one of the upmost impressive, compelling recordings in rock music history. It is also most certainly one of the very best first-outings by a rock group.    Indeed The Doors were one of the most exciting, influential and controversial rock bands of the swinging sixties with the legendary genius Jim Morrison as The Doors lead singer, Ray Manzarek controlling the spiralling electric organ, John Denmore on drums and Robby Krieger on guirtar. The Doors never actually recruited a bass player so the sound was, endearingly, highlighted by Ray Manzarek's predominant electric organ, providing a hypnotic backdrop for Jim Morrison's captivating vocals, who rides through the inventive musical landscapes with finesse.   The Doors (1967) album introduced the world to their adventurous, startling fusion of rock, blues, classical and jazz. These diverse blend of styles intertwine beautifully with the poetic, often thought-provoking lyrics, making for an incredibly powerful, innovative album that has set standard's for generations.    The albums opener is the belting and thoroughly infectious 'Break On Through (To The Other Side)', one of my personal favourite's. 'Break On Through' was also The Doors debut single release. The propulsive rhythm flows gloriously with notably nifty guirtar work courtesy of Robby Krieger, entwined with Ray Manzarek's bewitching, ever-effective electric organ interludes and incessant, pounding drum beats from John Denmore, not to mention Jim Morrison's rocketing vocals. An extremely credible start to the album and the single deserved far much more commercial recognition than it initially received at the time.  The stomping, thunderous rock of 'Soul Kitchen' is a cracking affair, complemented by Morrison's mesmerising vocal delivery while the beguiling Oriental mystery of 'The Crystal Ship' is a pure masterpiece (as is the entire album), mellowing the moodsomewhat.    Beginning with a magical guirtar riff, blended with the customary electric organ, this leads us into another compelling, stomping rock number 'Twentieth Century Fox', while the fun 'Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)' making for an immediately striking and rather diverting experiment. Morrison's deep, sonorous voice pulsates seamlessly through all the enchanting ebbs and flows.  'Light My Fire' is an out and out classic and one of The Doors major landmarks. Hauntingly atmospheric with its funeral-like electric organ backdrop and Morrison's stirring delivery. They enjoyed their first real taste of significant commercial success and acceptance with 'Light My Fire', swiftly topping the US Billboard Chart (though barely dented the UK Top 50 on its original release; upon its re-issue in the summer of 1991 it flew up into the Top 10). The full severn-minute version is a pure sonic masterpiece, allowing us to enjoy the groups ever-dynamic playing. Another utterly mesmerising and hypnotic afair.    The mid-tempo rock number 'Back Door Man' capture's yet more powerful, expert playing, hosting a rich and deep performance from Morrison who also enhances the tremendous and startling production of 'I Looked At You'.  The dreamy, mysterious 'End Of The Night' highlights the groups remarkable affinity for shrewd, poetic, profound lyrics. Beautiful. 'Take It As It Comes' kicks up the tempo again and this held ample commercial potential (as did practically every track on here), while the tinkling 11-minute oedipal drama 'The End' is literally spine-tingling and has to be one of The Doors most daring, compulsive outings that is completely haunting with its non-stop melodicism, dynamic tension and sombre, dreamy tone.    This album is a pure masterpiece, ranking (in my opinion) among their very best, most innovative work. Excellence all the way. It also became a major seller and spending over two years on the US Billboard chart. Essential!    Ian Phillips  April 2010

B00003CXA6|5.0|I had this on video cassette and finally bought this movie on dvd. Much better! Of course the story is the same in both formats but the dvd is much clearer. I read the book Killer Angels and just had to get this movie when it came out. I actually bought the video cassette at the Gettysburg visitor's center while my daughter was going to college in Emmitsburg, MD. We spent many weekends in Gettysburg so we got to know the place pretty well. Hats off to Ted Turner for making this movie, the best civil war movie made. I would highly recommend watching the section \\"The Making of Gettysburg\\" for an idea of how dedicated all involved in this movie were. The movie \\"Gods and Generals\\" is ok and chronologically comes before \\"Gettysburg\\" and would recommend watching that first.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I firmly believe that in a 1000 years this film will still be played as an example of the finest art of American movie making ever.  It's a remarkable story, Daniel Larusso is probably one of the most likeable kids ever played on screen.  This movie has so many greats about it, it's hard to explain.  The setting and characters in the movie are complex and wonderful.  For a kid who grew up in the Midwest, this movie showed me what I believed California was really like. I really thought all kids in California hung out at the beach kicking soccer balls around fires and rode around on dirt bikes.<br /><br />The story is great, almost any male boy can recognize with the theme of this movie at sometime in their life, how to deal with bullies who are physically violent to you for no reason.  Now let me say this as well, Johnny and the Cobra Kais were mislead by that psychotic karate instructor, \\"Johnny Kreese.\\"  Now a little discussed topic about the Karate Kid is \\"what makes Kreese tick?\\"  I think I have an answer and since my glowing review would probably sound like all the other  150 5 star reviews I'll just discuss one more complex character of the movie who is misunderstood.<br /><br />I beleive John Kreese, was sent to Vietnam at a young age, as a young man he was idealistic and had compassion for people.  When he first saw combat, he had the oppurtunity to finish a wounded enemy soldier, instead he showed mercy and let the man live, immediately the man pulled a hand grenade and killed John's best friend.  He realized that his weakness had gotten his friend killed, this angered him and plagued him with guilt, he then came to a conclusion, I must kill the enemy, or he will kill me.  This is where it came to Kreese that \\"mercy is for the weak.\\"  When John came home from the war he learned Karate, during his study he was taught that Karate is used for self defense.  John never changed the philosophy of Karate, he just knew from practical experience that shooting a sniper before he shoots you was the best defense.  This is the foundation of the Cobra Kai, the best defense is a strong and punishing offense.  John loved his Cobra Kais, and that is why he was so tough on them, he wished his father was tougher on him when he was younger, so that he would not have had to grow up so quickly one fateful day in Vietnam.  When you watch Karate Kid, do not judge Kreese as some brutal man who gets enjoyment out of watching a 15 year old kid get beaten, understand although his intentions and actions may seem misguided, his heart is just that of a patriot.  He truly beleives the beatings Daniel takes will make him a stronger man, the ending of this movie is proof that Kreese, although portrayed as the bad guy, truly is the most motivating factor behind the whole movie. Ultimately and indirectly Kreese provides Daniel with friendship and self confidence that would not have happened otherwise.shoots you was the best defense.

B000XTLUW0|5.0|Believe it or not, only recently did I discover the music of MUSE, and I love it. They are very creative, bringing a wide mix of musical influences, creating a very different type of prog music. Even though their music is very accesible and they've become a huge success selling millions of records, the music is still original, inventive, a real delight.    The video quality of the dvd is not the best I've seen, but it's still very good and captures the essence of their performance. Sound quality could be a bit better, but the performance more than makes up for whatever technical deficiencies the recording has. I hope they do a new dvd soon.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Pride & Prejudice BBC Review<br />7 Part Mini-Series on 2 Discs<br /><br />This complete remastered edition will be released Tuesday, April 24th.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was a 1995 Emmy Award-Winning BBC mini-series that runs about six hours long. Wonderfully done, but I do not recommend watching it all in one sitting as I had to do! This Jane Austen story examines the prejudices between classes in the 19th century and the pride that keeps lovers apart. It is an epic journey of romance, very gradual, no love at first sight here but a lot more realistic perspective on how affection develops and true love forms set in a time of manners and period dress and culture.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, this adaptation of the Jane Austen novel still holds up very well. Set in the first decade of the 19th century, it has an authentic look and feel in set, costumes, and manners. More impressively, the characters are able to take these complicated, beautifully written but difficult to say lines and present them with a bit of a modern tone for today's audiences to understand them.<br /><br />The remastered picture and sound greatly improves the presentation of this miniseries. I only caught one or two scenes that had difficulties because of lighting or being inside a carriage that couldn't switch over as well, but if you are a fan of this series or of Jane Austen stories at all, you need to have this set. It explores so thoroughly the story and captures many exact lines from the book without leaving anything out.<br /><br />There is no doubt how much Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy made a huge impact on his career, even to the point of reprising the role somewhat as Mark Darcy in \\"Bridget Jone's Diary\\" based off \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\" Tall, dark, handsome, mysterious, and decidedly grumpy, Firth's Mr. Darcy hits all the marks for a gradual character change. First he plays Elizabeth's perception of him for about the first half and then when her view of him changes, suddenly he is a little more open and forthcoming with goodwill.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is the most energetic and stubborn of her family and vows only to marry for love and not for money or status. Having five sisters puts their family at a disadvantage and all of her mother's attention is devoted to trying to marry them off. It is a classic story that most people are familiar with and can still emphasize with and relate to because of wonderful adaptations from the book like this one. Jennifer Ehle's performance is wonderfully proper and fiesty when she needs to be showing all the restraint and passion simultaneously that she can muster.<br /><br />I do enjoy the more recent version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" with Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen made 10 years after the BBC version because it speeds up some events and cuts it down to a more manageable running time of 127 minutes easier to do in one sitting compared to this version's 300 minutes. However what the 1995 version excels at is details and is more accurate to the book which die hard fans will love and find important. After all, I much prefer the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" extended editions of those movies because I love the story so much and adding in all those extras makes the time fly for me.<br /><br />My end conclusion is that this version of the story is divine for the fans out there and you should definitely pick this up for how reasonable the price is. I also recommend checking out the 2005 film of this story and 1995's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" that came out soon after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that year.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />\\"Lasting Impressions\\" - This feature with a running time of a full hour talks about the impact of the 1995 adaptation of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" which took a modern pace and contemporary delivery to appeal to today's audience. The people interviewed for this documentary were producer Sue Birtwistle, Benjamin Whitrow who played Mr. Bennett, Alison Steadman who played Mrs. Bennett, Crispin Bonham-Carter who played Mr. Bingley, Adrian Lukis who played Wickham, and Lucy Briers who played Mary Bennett. Alison Steadman and Lucy Briers are both much more attractive women in real life! The filming of the 22 week shoot is discussed such as the order of events and how certain actors were cast. For example, the proposal scene between Darcy and Elizabeth took place VERY early and would make or break the entire story. Bingley had to learn how to ride horse and Mary barely knew how to play piano and both had to practice quite a bit. Many of the actors talk about their first scene of filming and usually it was a pretty emotional scene that they were thrown into. The actors talk about the lack of makeup people wore in those times and how Mary was just set up with some greasy hair and a bit of powder thrown across her face while her sisters were all being beautified around her. A great challenge separating the classes like the Bennett House which looks grand on its own had to pale in comparison to all the other houses in appearance. There had to be substantial differences in class in costume material and meals like giant slabs of meat. This feature is a great exploration into the making of the film and getting to hear from the supporting actors about the process, the only thing missing is Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />An impromptu walkabout with Adrian Lukis (Wickham) and Lucy Briers (Mary) is the two actors walking about the Bennett home ten years later talking about their experience. It is mostly the two of them just chatting it up on what it would have been like if their two characters had gotten together and Colin Firth supposedly calls Lukis on the phone for a few minutes. There is also a feature on the technical restoration process and what a complicated detail-driven lengthy process it is. It includes a few of those voila! moments of before and after like you see in Blu-Ray commercials to show the difference in quality.<br /><br />Pride & Prejudice: A Turning Point for Period Drama - Andrew Davies, the screenwriter focused on the men to get them into the story since it mostly dwells with the women. Some extra opinions that chime in agree that Colin Firth just IS Mr. Darcy in a lot of ways for a lot of people.

0307454541|5.0|I had stared at this book on the bookshelf for months. It always intrigued me but not quite enough to buy it. I soon realized the bestseller lists could not be wrong and the fact that it is now a movie finally convinced me to buy it. Do not let the size of this book dissuade you. It is a quick read. I was not dissapointed. This book has everything you could want in a mystery. The story is about a down on his luck journalist who is hired by an old man to figure out the mystery of his lost niece. His niece disappeared over thirty years ago but he can not let it go. So Blomkvist is paid to live on this old man's island for a year to research and try to solve the mystery. The mystery goes really deep and the more he digs, the more dangerous things get for him. Bring in one private detective Lizbeth Salander to help this journalist and you have a unlikely duo who manage to uncover the family's huge secrets. The secrets are shocking and definitely not something that you could even began to fathom, no matter how hard you try to guess.  The two characters have great chemistry that I hope is explored more in the next two books to follow.

B002ZXNZQG|5.0|I'm sure Margret Mitchell fans will cringe at the comparison to JK Toole and I confess that \\"Confederacy\\" is no GWTW, however, Toole captures an era in New Orleans that has passed just like Mitchell captured the Old South that blew away with the Wind (Civil War).      Toole was one of the native New Orleanians he writes about and you will wish for a movie like \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" that so effectively delivers characters that meet your expectations of the book.  I loved that book, as well, and the movie created a synergy that made loving both get kicked up a notch.  However, Toole's narrative is not for the political correctness faint of heart and I can't see it ever coming to a screen near you.       As a native of Louisiana, but up the road in Baton Rouge, I was taken back to a time in both cities that isn't to be found in any other part of the country.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a period piece and incomparable writing that makes characters and history come to life.  I also recommend that you read \\"Confederacy\\" and then listen to it on Tape/CD.  The reader is excellent and his interpretation of the accents, cadence, inflection, and emotion is spot on.    We just celebrated the 30th anniversary of Confederacy and I reread it because I loved it so much way back yonder.  To tie up the comparison to Margret Mitchell and GWTW, Toole died before seeing his book's success and never wrote another.    You can't go wrong on this book - there is something for every historian, political correctness junkie, and book lover.

Above all, the music is pure genius. God knows if they'll ever go on the road again. Who knows if rock and roll will ever produce something this good again.
0393072231|3.0|Is Michael Lewis a good writer and story teller? Yes. Is his book informative and useful in laying bare the origin and evolution of subprime mortgage crisis? Kind of. Could his book have been better formulated? Yes, I am sorry to say. No rave review here.     Michael Lewis uses a good technique to develop his story. He follows the journeys  of Steve Eiseman, a former analyst for Oppenheimer & Co, Dr Mike Burry, a doctor with a fixation about stocks and bonds, and Charley Ledley, a small investor who stumbles onto a thesis about the subprime mortgage market and who evolves to become a bit player.  Later on, Lewis introduces another player in the drama, Greg Lippmann, a trader in subprime mortgages with Deutsche Bank. Each of these precocious ones spends considerable time studying the subprime market and concludes that it will eventually implode, perhaps taking entire firms with it. Consequently, they all bet against the market; hence the title: The Big Short. This is their story -- as the saying goes.     Lewis' book is witty and entertaining. He has lost none of his gift for drawing you into the narrative -- originally displayed to good effect in Liar's Poker. However, I am not sure a person with no understanding of the subprime market can follow the nuances of the instruments Lewis describes in the book. I have read several books about this issue, and at times I had to think about what was being said in order to follow it. A glossary of terms would have been helpful. So would an introductory chapter about the subprime market and the Wall Street setting before and after the debacle. That said, Lewis does try to make complex issues understandable and he does a good job explaining the environment in which big firms on Wall Street made a killing for a while -- and then lost big time. He is at his best describing the Wall Street culture and pathos.     I liked the human element of Lewis' story. This was the story of David and Goliath in a new setting, and David won (again). Eiseman, Burry and Ledley were all characters in their own right; they were misfits -- outsiders. However, they were not afraid to bet against the prevailing wisdom of Wall Street, to be laughed at and ridiculed -- only to be exonerated in the end. They also made a pile of money in the process. Lewis' book is their story as much as it is the story of Wall Street folly. Lewis' technique is effective because it underscores that the resulting debacle was not only forseeable, but that a few people actually did see the forest for the trees -- well inadvance of disaster. So much for, \\"No one saw it coming.\\"     There are some ways in which Lewis could have made his book even better. To begin with, it woud have interesting if Lewis had told his story from inside the subprime machine as well outside it. He could have recruited a trader for say, Lehman Brothers, to talk about the pressure to sell the CDOs -- even if they did not know what was in them. He could also have included an analyst from one of the rating agencies -- assuming someone was willing to talk after the fact. He could have included some borrowers who actually were the object of the subprime market. In that way, we could have had an even clearer picture of the of the \\"inside of the Doomsday machine.\\" Lewis does this to some extent with the inclusion of Gregg Lippmann of Deutsch Bank, the recitation of some of conversations at the Los Vegas  convention, and the attributed conversations of some of the big shots, but I think Lewis missed an opportunity to make a good book even better. The Big Short is at its best when the people running this train wreck in the making are allowed to speak in their own words in real time.     Two other additional observations:     First,the author seems to have a dim view of Wall Street's ability to gather any lessons from this debacle. I agree with this implied conclusion, but then where does that leave us? Stay away from Wall Street? Regulate the market? Put the offending traders and CEOS in jail? Start a revolution? Lewis is not very forthcoming on his prescriptions for this carnage. He talks around it, but I have no recollection of a clear plan of action being presented. I would have liked his concluding chapter to be more declarative about the solution to this mess --- unless of course he believes there is none, that this is simply the nature of the beast.     Second, the final part of Lewis' book story mentions the federal government's intervention at the last minute to prevent a complete national financial meltdown. Lewis talks about this almost in passing. I think he missed an opportuntiy to to drive home a key point: criminal misconduct went unpunished and Wall Street is left standing ONLY by the involuntary contributions of the US taxpayer. Lewis had the contacts and understanding to develop the end of the story very descriptively and in a manner which would bring this story home to the average citizen. Most of us know Goldman Sachs, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley should not still be in existence, but the story behind their bailouts remains to be told. What is particularly disturbing about this, is that the benefits were privitized but the risk was shifted to the public (as usual). Maybe this story can be Lewis's next book!

1439153663|4.0|THE KITCHEN HOUSE is a very readable, well researched novel of historical fiction.  Set in the late 1700's and early 1800's the action takes place mostly on a tobacco growing plantation in Southern Virginia with a side trip to Williamsburg.  The story is told alternately by two characters Lavinia and Belle.  Lavinia arrives on the plantation as a seven year old indentured servant from Ireland.  She has lost her family on her journey to America and is taken to the plantation by the ship's captain who is also the plantation's owner.  Lavinia is raised by the house slaves with whom she closely identifies.  The other voice is that of Belle whose father was the master of the house while her mother was his slave.  Lavinia gets most of the narration duties and her voice speaks in the past tense with formal conventional English except when she reports dialogue and then she repeats the language of the speaker with authenticity.  In shorter sections Belle speaks in the present tense with a less educated use of language.  Both voices are consistent and distinct.    The first half of the book is excellent as the characters and situations seem realistic.  The second half is equally readable but the characters become much more stereotyped and the plot more clichéd and predictable.  Many romance conventions are employed at this point though the author stops short of giving Belle and Lavinia traditional happily ever after endings.  I recommend THE KITCHEN HOUSE and would have given it five stars if the ending chapters had been as strong as the beginning ones.

B002VPE1B6|2.0|After all the hype and buzz about this movie I bought the Blu-ray version. Having never seen it at the theater I expected to be blown away by the story and cgi effects. It turned out to be the same old plot line about the evil humans destroying everything in their path. The cgi although getting better still looks like cgi. I had to watch this overly long movie in two sittings to keep myself from using the fast forward button. If there is a sequel I'll avoid it.
B002ZG97RE|5.0|I have mixed feelings about the movie, having read and reviewed most of the books on Dick Cheney's treason and our going into Iraq on the basis of 935 lies to the public and the United Nations, but on reflection it captures the essence:<br /><br />1)  The intelligence given to one and all was false<br /><br />2)  CIA was not at fault--CIA (not George \\"Slam Dunk\\" Tenet, himself guilty of treason)--got it right right from both the defector son in law and the line crossers that Charlie Allen demanded: kept the cook-books, disposed of all stocks, bluffing for regional power sake.<br /><br />3)  Bremer was a world-class idiot in disbanding the army and ending the Baath Party<br /><br />4)  DIA played along--the current US military leadership has lost all of its integrity (and Panetta is not much better than Tenet was, which really surprised me)--and was all too willing to kiss up while kicking down.<br /><br />There is so much left out of this (Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Ahmed Chaliba Iranian agent of influence) that I was tempted to go with four stars but had to go with five--for what it set out to do, this movie is spectacular.<br /><br />See all my non-fiction book reviews on Iraq via Phi Beta Iota, the Public Intelligence Blog.<br /><br />If you like this movie, I also recommend all the 9-11 Truth Movement DVDs.  What our government does in our name is nothing short of treason and a betrayal of the public trust.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I've been showing this film and it's 1999 re-make with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo for several years in a film appreciation class.....I always look forward to seeing them and always find something I haven't noticed before. TWO GREAT FILMS!!!!    The Steve McQueen / Faye Dunaway version incorporates split and multi screen imaging that works well for the timing of the plot of the film and is something new for cinema.    In the new version, Faye Dunaway plays Tommie Crown's shrink...a character that's not in the first film.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a phenomenal piece of work that has joined a handful of DVDs that I watch repetively on background when doing light work in the office--others include [[ASIN:B00067BBLY De-Lovely: The Cole Porter Story]]; [[ASIN:B00094ARN2 Beyond the Sea]]; and [[ASIN:B000I6BJ56 Joyeux Noel (Widescreen)]]. Of course my youngest son--the athlete--and I also love the best of the best in football movies, including [[ASIN:B000CDGVPS Remember the Titans (Director's Cut)]]; [[ASIN:B00004W221 Rudy (Special Edition)]]; and [[ASIN:B000J3OTT6 Invincible]], to name a few.<br /><br />What sets this movie apart, in my view, are the nuanced facial expressions and the deep sincerity that the two main actors bring to the screen.  I certainly regard the actor playing the hero of this film, the adopted son, to be in line for best supporting actor, or the other way around.  Every time I watch this movie I find something I missed before, and I simply do not tire of that pleasure.<br /><br />It troubles me that a movie as rich as this, telling a true story that is representative of what can be the best of America in a single individual doing the right thing for the right reasons, seems to bring little minds out of the crevices where they have been hiding.  This is not a Christian movie, an anti-Christian movie, a bi-racial movie, or anything else.  It is an American Story in the grandest possible manner.  In no way does that excuse the continuing segregation and abuse of people of color, the really rotten education system for all, the two-party tyranny, the corruption of the US government at all levels--but in one small very real time and space, one family--one mother--got it right.
B00382X4XC|5.0|This is the best available, folks. All other versions including Rhino, Castle, and original WB sound far worse than this one. If you don't like this one, tough, because there will probably not be a better one, so deal with it. Buy it. You won't send it back.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Avatar is the example of a film that got by on only its special effects.    The characters were so flat they weren't even two dimensional.  They were completely predictable and stereotypical.  The bad guys were so formulaic they were mere parodies.  Come on, couldn't Cameron make real bad bad-guys?  Heck, I've had elementary school teachers more evil and heinous than Avatars antagonists!  The \\"good guys\\" were just lame.  None of the characters had any depth whatsoever.    The plot was about as simplistic and predictable as its possible to get.  Godzilla movies show more creativity and intricacy in their plot structure.
B00102FELM|5.0|Klaus and the boys welcome back Uli, Herman and Rudy's brother Michael! It's a dream concert! I just wish they did \\"Steamrock Fever\\"!
B00005JMCT|5.0|I thought this movie was much better than the 2nd American Pie movie. Everyone has to remember that the cast are much older in this movie and are cast as recent college graduates. You can't expect the same types of jokes as from the first American Pie movie. This movie was brilliant! The dance off scene at the club was just classic! Stripper party was hilarious, Stifler eating dog poop, and Stifler doing grandma by accident was great!!!!!!!!!!! In a lot of ways this movie was even better than the first one! The only part that was kind of boring was the introduction of Jim's main squeeze's sister into the movie. That side plot was kind of boring in my opinion. I am really not sure how some of the reviewers are saying that the 2nd American Pie movie was better than this one??????
B00005EAXF|5.0|Well worth buying agian in it's proper form...uncut! I have this on the old import format video CD and it's much better and LONGER on DVD...US, must have a region free player.
B00003CX95|1.0|Is it possible to give no stars to a film?  Here are 3 hours I will never have back.  The ham-fisted direction of Mr Gibson leaves no cliche untouched and does in 10 minutes what can be done in 1.  I have come to expect unnecessary blood and gore from Mr Gibson so this is no surprise but the swelling music and apparent lack of historical accuracy are new.  I am still wondering why I bothered sitting through to the end of the film.
B002VZC9CY|2.0|I found myself crossing my fingers hoping the next track was better. I'm a big fan but maybe next time.
B000008B01|5.0|You may have noticed that all the reviews for this album rate it with 5 stars.   I'd like to be the dissenting reviewer-but only to add more stars.  I have loved this album since I first heard it more than 30 years ago.  Time hasn't changed my feelings about it.  If you enjoy Brazilian music or even think you might enjoy it, then pay any price to get this gem into your life.
0316069906|5.0|Beautifully written. He allows the reader to come along for the growth spurt that takes place in his life when he comes to terms with eating animals. Terrific, informative book.
159562015X|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading StrenthsFinder 2.0 after seeing on the Bestseller lists for so long, and yet I find myself so disappointed that I wanted to share a review and provide another perspective on why this book fails, in my opinion, to provide true value for the reader.<br /><br />The book itself is more of an outline of the Gallup Organizations 34 Key Personality Traits than an insightful overview, which was disappointing to me. In addition, the book is supported by an online test that is designed to, through 177 questions, help you to assess the 5 Traits or Qualities that are your true Strengths. I don't disagree with the assesment that the survey made, but I'm shocked by the lack of actionable feedback based on such strong data. If I wanted to \\"Know Myself\\" better, I would have spent the time and money in Meditation Lessons, not trying to capitalize on my innate strengths, as the book purports to assist with.<br /><br />Perhaps I was expecting too much from a book, but I found StrengthsFinder 2.0 to be full of a lot of hype and very little substance.
B001TW68P4|4.0|Highly recommended!  Was pleasantly surprised by a couple of songs that I had forgotten about...Gave it 4-stars because there were a couple of tracks that really weren't \\"hits\\" IMHO, but otherwise, it was great!
B000BYRCH4|5.0|This was a good action movie, that we saw on T.V. We watched the movie as a family and enjoyed all of the action. We enjoyed seeing the sea and sea life. We enjoyed the plot line and the actors, they did a great job! You will enjoy all of the views and all of the action and great actors! It was a great movie because it was a great movie, not just because of the female in the movie, although her acting is good. All of the actors did a great job, not just Alba.     We plan to purchase this movie once we find the movie on DVD for a good price. It was great to see the movie on T.V. first so that we will know that it is a good movie before we purchase. Get ready for some twist and turns!
0525421580|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I have to agree with Pat Shand's review that Levithan's (whom I adore) Will Grayson started out a little flat.  Tiny Cooper kept me in the story. Then, the interaction between WG-1 and WG-2 began and I was in - hook, line, sinker.    Let me say - without screams from any National Coalition to Save My Child - I read out loud to my 8 year old as she is falling asleep each night.  Just from the few pages she heard here and there, she wanted to know what happened to Tiny Cooper.  Part of the reason, I'm sure, is because he is such a presence in the book.  For me, it was how Green & Levithan floated Tiny (if that is possible) from WG-1 to WG-2.  Amazing because you truly get to discover Tiny from two perspectives.  Having recently read [[ASIN:0545123283 Linger]] (the follow-up to Maggie Stiefvater's [[ASIN:0545123267 Shiver]]), I am fascinated by stories told through multiple voices.  I am even more impressed when two authors write the multiple voices and develop someone as thoroughly as Tiny. Bravo boys.    I am lucky enough to teach YA lit at the university level and look for a couple of new books each year to use as required reading (every other book in the class is choice).  With Will Grayson, Will Grayson, I am so emotionally attached to these characters I am timid about choosing this book... I don't want anyone to read it and tell me they didn't like it! However, with two fabulous authors and their equally fabulous Will Graysons, I'm willing to take that chance.
0064431789|5.0|My daughter and I read this book all the time. The pictures are great and the story is short enough that she can read it without getting tired.
B000B8657S|3.0|I concur with Tom Lawrence, \\"Florestan\\" and Angus Grant in their reviews.  As someone with a decent collection of Schubert song CD's, over 40, the set as presented is an academic achievement and useful for sampling individual songs otherwise unavailable on disk.  However for entertainment or casual listening I just do not play the individual disks but return to the song recitals of the original issue, or other recital disks.  Apart from some extended listening on first purchase, and occasional searching for a particular rarely performed song as a reference performance, it sits un-played.<br /><br />The booklet is beyond a nuisance.  Even as just a location index to the series it has its problems, the type in bold face is too small and set too close together to read, I do not need glasses to read and, have to use use a low powers magnifying glass - if only an additional 1/2  line of blank space had been allowed between the entries if a standard 12 pt. type face were not to be used.  In order to find songs I have had to blow up a Xerox of the pages to 11 x 8 in. sheets to provide me with a working index.  For the song texts I use another source.  One wishes that Hyperion had provided the full materials from the original issue, and on CD as a PDF if their printing is in such reduced size so that that texts etc. could then be printed out in what ever size an individual requires.
B00275EGX8|4.0|i had heard many of my friends telling me the movie was great but been so busy that i never had the chance to go check it out at the theaters. so when it came out on blu ray i decided to pick it up at bestbuy and on sale. after watching it,i think that it was original. the special effects was superb. only thing that was disturbing was the three main guys rolled together everywhere... whereas in the military we do not really go out just to go out unless we're sf.  anyways... aside from comparing with the real military it was pretty good.
B002U6DVQM|5.0|Short and simply put, a masterpiece by a master filmmaker.  The picture quality of the blue ray is stunning, as I watch I want to print stills from the film because the images are that striking.
B00005LIN0|5.0|I first ordered Porgy from a company called \\"moviemars\\" which I found in Amazon's NEW and USED listings.  I paid for faster delivery, but moviemars didn't even look at my order for 3 days.  When I checked moviemars out on Google, there were so many complaints about them that I panicked and purchased a backup copy directly from Amazon.  Moviemars took more than a week, but they did get it to me in time for my needs.  Because Amazon cost about $10 more, I returned Amazon and kept moviemars.      I am a bit embarrassed about taking advantage of Amazon's kind return policies, but I also think Amazon should be more careful of which companies they recommend.  After all, Amazon was able to deliver in only 2 days, whereas moviemars hadn't even started packing my purchase 3 days after they received it!.      Bottom line: Buy direct from Amazon most of the time. Check Amazon's alternative suppliers on Google before trusting them.
B001HN694K|3.0|Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland didn't exactly live up to its hype, yet it was not as terrible as what many other reviewers have been saying.  I would agree that more attention seemed to be given to the 3-D effects and small details than the storyline, but that's to be expected for a \\"kids\\" movie (especially from Burton).  The movie was appropriate for all audiences, but was probably more interesting to the younger generations (despite the disturbing Red Queen and her demand for \\"Off with their heads!\\").  What I enjoy most about the movie is the inspiration that Alice offers to each individual and the reminder she gives that every person has the ability to become something great.  The movie also persuades the audience to root for the underdog.  It seems as though all the odds are against Alice, but with the help of friends, she triumphs.  This reminds me of Ecclesiastes 4:12 that says, \\"Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves.  A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.\\"  When we team up, the tough stuff can be accomplished!  The Red Queen serves as the perfect example of an individual blinded by their selfishness.  Fortunately a corrupt leader/person will always get what they deserve in the long run (Romans 2:12).  Overall, remember to speak up for yourself and don't go along with the crowd (\\"Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind\\" Romans 12:2).  Do what is right, even if it's hard because the outcome is worth it!!
0307454541|5.0|This was a great book. I have never read this author & heard about it from a movie review. I love foreign movies so I am sure the movie will be as good. It was a book u did not want to put down as u wanted to know what was going to happen next. Will read his other books...
B001NLKT60|2.0|Why this series garners such great reviews is beyond me.  I found it very difficult to navigate around all the characters.  There are too many other really good stories out there  that don't  require remedial Swedish for a good read.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I SAW JOE AT TPAC LAST YEAR AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDMAN HAS PROBLEMS MIXING THE BAND PROPERLY WHEN ALL WERE PLAYING HE STILL SHINED LIKE A NEW DIAMOND. THIS DVD CAPTURES WHAT JOE IS ALL ABOUT, PLAYING HEAVY ROCKIN' BLUES AND FEELING EVERY BIT OF IT TOO! HIS VOCALS ARE GREAT AND HIS GUITAR PLAYING IS BY FAR THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN FROM START TO FINISH FLAWLESS.
B00000ILDF|2.0|Much has been written about the troubled production of Alien 3 and the problems that director Fincher faced at the hands of the studio. I only remember being extremely disappointed with this film as a sequel to Aliens, one of my most favourite of all sci fi movies.    As a film, Aliens is awesome fun, a real nail biting rollercoaster, with fun likeable characters and a triumphant ending. You finish watching Aliens and you feel good. Ripley saved the day, rescued the child and saved a couple of other crew members, cool characters in their own right. As a sequel to the excellent Alien, it is a great success, because it did not try to repeat what Ridley Scott had done. If there was a graph describing the Alien franchise, Cameron left it climbing high.    It crashes down hard with Alien 3. Alien 3 is the cold turkey crash after the heroin rush of Aliens. Everything Ripley has achieved is thrown away in the opening credits of this film. Newt and Hicks are killed just like that. You liked them in Aliens? Tough, they are gone. You are introduced to a whole cast of prison characters who, in addition being hard to identify because they all look much the same, are either unlikeable or tragic. Its like the people who made this film didn't really understand what had gone before it and had no real love for the characters that James Cameron had so painstakingly created. On its own, it might be ok. But it's a sequel to Aliens written by unsympathetic writers.     Watching it is like reading a sequel to Pride & Prejudice, in which Mr Darcy cheats on Elizabeth Bennet (with a man), or a sequel to Winnie the Pooh, where Christopher Robin burns all his toys and laughs at the tears welling up in Poohs eyes as he tries to rescue Piglet from the flames but only succeeds in immolating himself.        I
B000002H6C|5.0|This is my first review for amazon, although I've read hundreds of them. I prefer the direct approach to a track-by-track breakdown, and I felt the urge to weigh in on one of my favorite albums of all time. Like a lot of Metallica fans, I wasn't thrilled with the direction they took post-Justice. This is not so much because the \\"Black Album\\" was bad, more that Justice was so advanced technically and lyrically it made the follow-up feel like a cop-out. Lyrically, this album is the most bitter, incisive, and all-around literate of all Metallica's albums, and among the best I've heard in any genre. James' vocals are full of bile and the music is unrelentingly aggressive. The bookends of \\"blackened\\" and \\"dyers eve\\" stand as two of the greatest metal songs of all time, and everything between is compelling despite the extended song structures. On the production end, could the lack of bass be a subtle tribute to the late Cliff Burton? That's always been my theory. Either way, this album is an unimpeachable tour-de-force, essential for any Metalhead, and the high point of Metallica's carrer.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Don't look now, but Kick-Ass is the beginning of a new trend in superhero movies.  Here's why it matters:<br /><br />Two words: Hit-Girl.  Or maybe that's one word. Whatever.  Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) isn't just an equalizer, she's a cross between Stephanie from LazyTown and Robin from Batman.  Hit-Girl is a descendant of the same violent breed of superhero that has been beating villains up for decades, except that she's an 11-year-old girl.  More importantly, she's a female superhero that isn't overtly sexual.  She's the next step up from the Powerpuff Girls. I realized that true Girl Power had come to superhero movies when Hit-Girl punched a grown man in the face with brass knuckles.<br /><br />Being a superhero has consequences.  We are reminded that Hit-Girl is basically a sociopath who has never been to school.  Hit-Girl views life as a video game, a point reinforced in first-person perspective through her nightvision goggles as she shoots and stabs her way through piles of thugs. Her father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) is a cold-blooded killer who will slit his opponents' throats. Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) is so terrified of the mass slaughter the aforementioned \\"heroes\\" inflict that he vows to quit the superhero gig entirely.  It doesn't stick of course.<br /><br />It was a graphic novel FIRST. Graphic novels often trail movies, adding more detail that was left out.  Kick-Ass the comic was released before the movie, giving the entire plot away.  It doesn't seem to have harmed the film at all. Graphic novels may now become an official extension of movies as part of their development - storyboards and comic panels have a lot in common after all.<br /><br />Kick-Ass plays for keeps. Kick-Ass isn't so much realistic as it is gritty.  It dispenses with superhero tropes like superpowers and embraces the difficulties of secret identities, not having any powers, and getting hurt.  Kick-Ass gets so beaten up by an uncaring world that he lands in a hospital.  People die.  A lot.<br /><br />Part thoughtful meditation on the perils of our violence-drenched celebrity culture, part non-stop rollercoaster ride of every adolescent's superhero dreams, Kick-Ass is like one long movie trailer - all action without the boring parts. Kick-Ass is awesome, not because of just what it does but because of what it represents.  I patiently await a more PG-oriented version of Hit-Girl that will inspire little girls everywhere to play with superhero action figures.tion on the perils of our violence-drenched celebrity culture, part non-stop rollercoaster ride of every adolescent's superhero dreams, Kick-Ass is like one long movie trailer - all action without the boring parts.

B002VECM6S|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  An inspiring story of courage and grace.  The fact that it is based on a true story made this even better for me.. It proves there really are angels out there.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|One of the most complicated movies ever made, and there isn't one making-of doc, outtake, deleted scene, trailer, or commentary included on this release?  Even the $5.99 Scooby-Doo DVD's my kid watches have something extra.  Maybe if this release was priced the same as those, I'd buy it.  MAYBE.
B000U91OII|4.0|This fan works great compared to the noisy broken fan that came on on my chipset's heat sink. Looks like every fan i've seen before but seems to be slightly higher quality. I don't think I can even hear this fan at all over hard drive and case fan noise. It's pretty close to silent.    It doesn't come with screws so make sure to save and reuse the ones that were holding down your old fan.
B002PY86WI|5.0|Not a huge Madonna fan, but this collection has everything you need.  I got it mainly for the 80's songs which are must haves for any collection.  Every song sounds great.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|The only redeeming feature about this film was the quality of the video animation. It was outstanding. But the left wing liberal idiots in Hollywood with their ugly american exploitation of the enviornment and testosterone laden military bent on carnage and destruction is garbage. This isn't a movie. It is political commentary from the far left that runs Hollywierd. If I could give this piece of garbage less than one star, I would. Unfortunately we aren't allowed negative values. The lousy plot was so predictable as to be funny if it wasn't so pathetic. I am tired of the hubris and arrogance that comes out of these studios. They will try to make you believe what they think and if you don't you must be too stupid to understand. This film belongs in the scrap heap.
0061673730|5.0|If nothing else, this book shows how deeply the human mind can delve into the metaphysical.  It is many books in one: A gripping tale, an autobiography, a philosophical treatise.  It's one of those books that every time you read it, you glean new and wonderful information.  I don't think it's possible to read this book so many times that you've exhausted all it has to offer.
0978606310|5.0|This has to be the best book for My Little Pony collectors.  It has a full color picture of every single pony from this era, along with a detailed list of every item the pony came with.  Absolutely a requirement for anyone trying to organize & sort out their collection.  I have already bought her G3 (generation 3) book & the one that followed.  Summer Hayes is now at the top of my \\"favorites\\" list!
B002SEW5WW|4.0|CD came pretty quickly, in good condition. Overall quality good for the price, for sure.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Since I did not see the film in the theater the first time I don't mind that this edition did not contain extra footage or a documentary on the making of this movie. Visually, this film was hypnotic and stunning and is another great  Cameron accomplishment. If you have not yet watched AVATAR on the big screen or video, movie experiences this unique only occur a few times in the life of a sci-fi movie fan. Note that the Blu-Ray presentation was absolutely fantastic and the only thing missing was a 3-D presentation!<br /><br />Update-I just got back from seeing the IMAX 3D Avatar Special Edition in the theater and wish to report that this newer more complete edition makes more sense than the first release because of the additional footage.  Also, the IMAX 3D experience was just incredible, taking my aged eyes only a few seconds to adjust to the 3D format. I hope they market this edition on BLU-Ray and somehow get it into some good technology form of 3D!
B002WCLG48|4.0|This is an interesting conglomeration of stories about the Halo Universe, although it is not what I had anticipated. The style of animation varies from story to story, making each more unique, but it also makes the episodes more isolated from each other. I enjoyed watching all of the 'legends,' some of which are more to informative about the Halo universe, while others (Odd One Out), are more entertaining. This is a good choice for Halo fans, and although it not as useful for viewers who are not particularly interested in the history of the Halo universe, Halo Legends will still provide some entertainment, though more so in the later episodes.
B00275EGX8|1.0|This is the most laughable war movie ever. Nothing in the movie is correct, and it plays out more like what a typical FoxNEWS viewer who's never been in Iraq would picture the war to be like. There is a mishmash of PTSD, lots of crying, some fighting, horrific displays of \\"tactics,\\" and a slight delve into soldiers favorite slur: hajji which is portrayed as a significant emotional event by the one guy who says it. A more accurate title for this movie would be \\"Hallmark Presents: IRAQ! The After School Special.\\"    Aside from the ludicrous plot, complete disregard for any sort of military accuracy, and ho-hum backdrops (when Black Hawk Down's recreation of Mogadishu, Somalia looks more like Iraq than the Hurt Locker, there might be a problem), the Hurt Locker greatly suffers from terrible acting. The main character played by Jeremy Renner, is the only actor who really looks like he is trying. His supporting cast plays every cliche in the book from \\"Scared-Teenager\\" to \\"Partner who Wants To Be Tough But Lives In Fear\\" to \\"Cowboy Colonel\\" to \\"Crusty Mercinary, or Maybe He's Special Forces, I Don't Know Because He Wasn't Introduced, Oh Wait Now He's Dead.\\" The movie tries to be everything. It tries to put its Explosive Ordinance Disposal team through EVERYTHING from disarming bombs to executing ludicrous attempts at infantry tactics, to engaging in a sniper battle instead of focusing and developing a strong plot on a narrow band of topics.      Eventhough it was easily one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, I will give credit where it is due. The hurt Locker does have a very good ending. If you don't want it spoiled because somehow you still want to watch this filmschool project gone awry, stop reading. If you've decided to take my advice, here is the spoiler: The Hurt Locker's ending is the conclusion of the movie's opening statement that war is a drug. Renner's character returns home and realizes that he misses Iraq, he misses the thrill one can only get from constantly living in constant danger, with people trying to kill you. He picks up his son, and then it cuts to him reporting to a new unit for another tour in Iraq. This was probably the only well done part of the whole movie, and I have yet to see another movie touch on it, which more should.     In the end, Hurt Locker gets a big thumbs down. Go watch Gunner Palace instead.
B00150B2SS|4.0|A challenging, but rewarding, read involving a (presumably) realistic view of the world of international espionage. The primary themes touch on the motivations of individuals in such a world and the struggle to find and a serve a master when one's motives are always in question. That struggle often takes the form of misdirection in George Smiley's world as he unravels a mystery in this story. In his world where mendacity and dogma are the principle motivators, it was striking how much power resides in the sense of personal obligation to one's friends.     Most narrative stories are told in the past tense, but this one takes it a step further and the plot entails recounting the past, both through the main character's recollections and through his interviews of other characters. Very little takes place in the present time line of the plot. This time shifting, along with the careful staging of which past events get revealed in which order, makes for an interesting story.    \\"There are moments that are made up of too much stuff for them to be lived at the time they occur.\\"    Smiley solves the mystery, but while the reader is privy to his observations, we're not privy to all the inferences he draws from them. So, in the end, it's still not entirely clear how he came to his conclusions. This hazy view of the story makes for a difficult read, but adds to the atmosphere: in Smiley's world, there is no perfect information and everything is clouded by bias, distortion, and subterfuge. So by telling the story in a veiled manner, LeCarre immerses the reader in the espionage milieu.
B000SQKZKG|5.0|Well, I imagine most people purchasing this on CD probably had it on vinyl or tape many years ago.  But if there's anyone who's never heard this live recording of ELP, I'll try to explain.  ELP was one of the top progressive rock bands of the 70s, combining rock with jazz and classical, and wanting to remain entertaining the whole time.  They released many very successful studio albums, but on this live album you can really hear how the energy of the crowd feeds the band and pushes them up yet another notch.  It is noteworthy that the music is amazingly \\"full\\" sounding....this is a band of only three people, there is no backing tracks, no midi, no sequencing...in fact, there wasn't even a polyphonic synthesizer invented yet.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie was awesome. It took about 2 days longer for me to receive it than what was actually listed, but it was well worth the wait!
B002VECM72|5.0|Everyone should see this film! It is very close to the true story and Sandra Bullock did an amazing job!  Please tell everyone this isn't a 'FOOTBALL\\" films, for those who aren't sport's enthusiasts!
1400032717|5.0|The book came in a timely manner and was in good shape. Even with shipping I saved money.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|I have to say I was highly disappointed in this movie.  I guess the only thing going for it was the 3-D in the theater.  If any of you have ever seen the cartoon movie \\"Ferngully\\" this movie is  a rip-off of the entire storyline!  The giant tree of life, the giant bulldozer scene, the guy being changed into another creature, the moral of protecting all of nature because it all has a purpose - REALLY?  There was nothing original in this movie except the people being blue.  I was expecting so much more.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This will be short and sweet. If you really want to buy Avatar now, BUY IT NOW for gosh sakes! Inspired by other posters and reviewers, I was going to wait until the \\"director's cut\\" was released to purchase my BR version of Avatar. I decided to go ahead and buy it because I wouldn't be punishing the studio by not purchasing it now, I would be punishing myself. I DO appreciate everyone's input clarifying that the DVD (BR or standard) is stripped down. But I seldom watch the movie preview on purchased DVDs and maybe I will, maybe I won't buy the extended version, coming out just in time for Christmas. However, I wanted to watch Avatar again and frankly I made up my own mind that now is better than 6 months from now. So I got a BR copy and a standard DVD copy for 19.99 from a local retailer. I am very happy I did not wait!
B00065MDSG|5.0|Robert Fripp's musical vision is a dark, uncompromising place. There's no room for frivolity in this dense, shadowy but fertile undergrowth. This is serious music. Songs to listen to reverently; with headphones, in solitude. Ideally, Lark's Tongues... should be experienced one-on-one. And turn up the volume - there are a lot of quiet bits - specifically the intros to Exiles, Talking Drum and Lark's Tongues Part 1 - can easily waft by in the background if, like me, you generally listen to music at modest volume.<br />And here's the crux - whereas Red comes charging out of the speakers like an enraged rhino, Lark's Tongues is a restrained creature by comparison, its subtleties demanding more a active listening ear.  This is one of the reasons why this remastering is so crucial; the crystal clear top-end provided by the digital remastering is crucial for getting the most out of this album.<br />As with most King Crimson albums you get long meandering - but never self-indulgent - passages punctuated by proper songs with verses and choruses. Exiles and Easy Money are both classics. Book of Saturdays is a particular delight. The title track needs no further introduction, forming an integral part of Crimson live shows to this day.<br />I would definitely class this as one of Crimson's best albums, better than Red, even. David Cross's  violin, Jamie Muir's imaginative percussion work, Robert Fripp's fluid guitar playing and Bill Bruford's crisp drumming mesh perfectly to create the consummate King Crimson record. This is a rich, compelling and, dare I say, cathartic musical experience.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|This is a fantastic show including the behind the scenes documentary.  The sounds, songs, and the visuals are absolutely beautiful.
B00005R62N|5.0|I was about 8 years old when I 1st heard this recording, back then it was just a cheap copied cassette, but the songs stuck with me.  This remastered version is the best yet and filled with their classic late 70's songs, all of which sound better on this live recording then on the original releases.  I love Judas Priest and have replaced all my original CD's with the remastered versions with bonus tracks, well worth it just like the Megadeth remasters.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|this movie started out very good.. but in the middle, it veered off to something else.. then caught back up in the end.. i did not like the way they were tricked into the box.. of course they could have said no, to activating.. but they were  not told what else would happen.. and all the kids were left without parents.. bad movie..
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This is the third time this movie has been remade.  The original was made in 1956 called The Bad Seed.  It was about this 11-year-old girl who, although looked cute and innocent with those blonde pigtails, was really in fact evil.  I watched snippets of the film and didn't find it scary at all.  Then in 1993 there was \\"The Good Son\\", starring Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood.  Henry (played by Culkin) appears to be the good son, but Mark (Wood) sees his true colours.  This movie scared me.  Macaulay Culkin's performance is phenomenal; a 10, no question.  Now Orphan (2009) takes a different approach.  Here you have a 9-year-old girl named Esther.  Esther is orphaned because her adopted parents were killed and the house was burned down.  Again, Esther seems sweet and innocent, but evil lurks behind.  The end of the movie shocked me, and probably a few other people too.  I was not expecting it.  Isabelle Fuhrman plays Esther, and she does a remarkable job in the role.  Hope to see her in future movies.
B002VECM4A|5.0|There is nothing enjoyable about a story of an inner city, black girl who is obese, dark, homely, illiterate, and pregnant. Even her second pregnancy is also from her father raping her, and a mother who despises her for having \\"taken her man from her.\\"<br /><br />The title character, Precious, sees the only glimmer of hope in her life through fantasy and  daydreaming that her handsome white teacher is secretly in love with her or that she is a singing sensation and a dazzling celebrity adored by millions. This is her only shield against the sadistic impulsiveness of a maternal nightmare of a mother, whose one constant in life is beating and degrading her daughter while scheming to get more out of the welfare system. Precious' incestuous pregnancy turns into her salvation as she is helped into an alternative educational program where she learns that love is not what she received at home. She must also understand the reality that people can be nice to her who hardly know her. From these experiences, she begins to learn self-esteem one day at a time.<br /><br />The movie tugs at you in two directions, as you cheer for someone to break free of the shackles of the welfare system and ignorance, while you develop utter contempt for the program through the behavior and ignorance of her subhuman mother. There is hope for one, but you get the feeling there is absolutely none for the other, and you end up not caring at all if there is.<br /><br />This movie introduces us to the acting talent of Gabourey Sidibe who plays Precious. Her mother is played by Mo'Nique who has won critical acclaim for her role, which was all too convincing. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey are very effective in supporting roles.<br /><br />It reminded me of the beatitude: \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs in the Kingdom of God.\\" If you choose to see \\"Precious,\\" and if you actually believe that there are people like her out there, you'll know that they deserve at least that much.
1400156947|4.0|This audio book is the first time I have been through `Vanity Fair' and I thought it was a good way to be introduced to this work.  The narrator was Wanda McCaddon.  I have heard her before in other classic works and she consistently does a good job as she did in this case.  Her characterizations and intonations were good and I think that always helps in getting into the story.  The only small complaint I have is that the narrator of the story is clearly male, so it would have been nice to have a male reader.  Thackeray uses the narrator's voice a lot, so it would have been a better choice.<br /><br />The story itself is clearly full of satire, which poked fun at the upper class in England during the early 19th century.  Thackeray does an excellent job bringing out and emphasizing almost every flaw one would expect from this class of people.  They are obviously caricatures, but are still close enough to the truth to make you think that you know people like those characters.  Even his rare protagonists are almost too good.<br /><br />I recommend this audio book to any one interested in this great classic.

B000AV2G3I|4.0|It is sad to know that this year will be the tragic 30th anniversary since John Lennon was sadly murdered near his home in New York City. Nevertheless, his music on his own and with The Beatles has kept on inspiring people from all around the world. His messages and his life from fighting for his rights to be a legal citizen of America, to his feelings about popularity from being a bigger than Jesus during his Beatles days, Lennon wasn't afriad to honestly speak his mind. While it is deeply sad the way that John Lennon had died, his music still remain as a deep and constant reminder to why his songs are still as popular today as they've been all the way back to the 1960's. But there have been so many different ways that John Lennon's music have been showcased in hits collections, but this is definitely the best one.<br /><br />Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon is a strong and deeply-showcased retrospective of why John Lennon's music is alive and well. The songs here have all been remastered from his work on his 70's recordings, to those leftovers that John Lennon's voice brought down the house for even after he was murdered. The collection includes all of his greatest including the strong and intimate and deeply-showcased Imagine, to Watching The Wheels, all the way to Instant Karma, Nobody Told Me and Woman. Every song is showcased, and remastered better than most of the other John Lennon collections tried to show before like Lennon Legend in 1997. There are also a few great songs here that are surprising as well that've been disaplayed differently from Lennon's voice including Real Love (which was also recorded by the surviving Beatles through Lennon's tapes, a few years earlier.) The song takes on a very intimate life of its own as it is stripped-down and soulfully showcased on the intimacy of a simple voice and piano.<br /><br />All in all, of all the John Lennon retrospectives, Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon is absolutely the best one out there. You really do honestly get what you pay for from his music, and John Lennon would've been so proud to know that his music has never stopped losing its spirit, 30 years after he lost his life. If you've never owned a single John Lennon album before, this is definitely the one you should get. Imagine what would've been from John, and imagine te joy he had left behind.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+ly do honestly get what you pay for from his music, and John Lennon would've been so proud to know that his music has never stopped losing its spirit, 30 years after he lost his life.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|These cables work as intended and at a fairly good price.  The price was the main factor as well as quality.  The quality of these cables are good and provide picture quality like all other hdmi cables do.  The connector seems fairly durable and the cable doesnt look like its about to fall apart - thats all you really need to know about for an hdmi cable as they are all the same - either you get a signal or you dont.  With prime these cables came out to be a good price + no tax.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer is doing all of us an immense service by studying the threat of radical (or not so radical) Islam and writing books like this one. In The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam, he shows how Islam is not the religion of peace and tolerance by quoting from the sources- the Quran and the Hadiths. In doing so  he is warning us about the threat to civilization posed by those Muslims who take their scriptures seriously. I do not believe that Spencer could be called \\"Islamophobic\\" except in the sense that he is afraid of what will likely happed if these people get their way and manage to impose Sharia on the whole world.
B003GSTLAS|5.0|Great episode.  I purchased this episode as I missed watching it on tv and wanted to keep up to date with season 3.  For the price it's not bad and this show is worth it.  Let's hope for a season 4 ;)
006621131X|5.0|This memoir by punk poet/performer Smith is a well written elegy to her lover, best friend, and roommate for their hardscrabble years, Robert Mapplethorpe. Smith recounts how a chance meeting in 1967 began a relationship that would last until Robert's death from AIDS in 1989. The two young people, she from an artistic and supportive family and he from a stricter Catholic one, felt an immediate bond and became each other's anchor and truest sounding board.      Smith and Mapplethorpe lived in New York city when so many famous artistic types were wandering about, and Patti writes matter-of-factly about meeting Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and William Burroughs while she was gaining entree into the performance world. They had some lean (very lean!) years, but eventually, as we know, both Smith and Mapplethorpe found fame and fortune in the arts. In the years before their success, though, Patti and Robert roamed a New York that has long disappeared and found it both wonderful and cruel. Smith's nostalgic tone is just right in this particular regard.  Smith also writes candidly about Robert discovering his homosexuality, about her love affairs with Sam Shepard and a member of Blue Oyster Cult, and makes no apologies for her life.       For all the darkness sometimes seen in her work, Smith comes across as shy rather than angry, and spiritual rather than nihilistic. She writes of meeting and marrying Fred Sonic Smith, and how her marriage and family life drew her a little apart from Robert, who by that time had met the patron/lover of his life and was happily gaining notoriety with his provocative photography. But when Robert was sick and dying, Patti was near him till the end. The love they shared is palpably apparent throughout this retelling and although there is heartbreak, there are also light and entertaining scenes of warmth and success and connection.

B00005RIKI|5.0|........ who has been with Skynyrd from the beginning. Between '73 and '75 I saw them live twice in San Diego, while I was still in the Navy, and 3 or 4 times since then, both the original group and the rebuilt one. If I had to describe the authenticity, and brute HONESTY of this band, I would simply quote something Ronnie said in an interview way back when. The interviewer asked him why he always performed bare-foot on stage, while performing. His reply was awesome: \\"Because I want to feel the stage BURN under my feet. I need to feel the HEAT!\\", or words very similar to that (the interview was a long time ago). There was not an ounce of fake in the man, anywhere, nor in his band. Remember the man, and save a thought for Steve Gaines, his sister Cassie, Leon, Billy, Allan, and Hughie, also. Don't ever forget Hughie. Thanks for your attention.......

193413712X|5.0|Had it not been for it winning the Pulitzer, I doubt if I would have ever picked up this book. If that had been the case, my life would have been the poorer for it.    What Mr. Harding does in Tinkers is nothing short of astonishing. He takes the tale of a dying man who is surrounded by family but is drifting away from life and shows us a life through an ever-shifting kaleidoscope.    I simply cannot remember when a writer has managed to engage not just my mind, but my senses as well. His descriptions of life in New England are flawless and so real you'll swear you smell the wood smoke on a cold morning or hear fishing jumping in a pond late at night. I couldn't help but be reminded of the prose poems of Robert Frost as I read scenes such as the one where curled leaves become boats set afloat down streams. At other points where the perspective or narrative voice shifts so quickly it almost gives you literary whiplash, I'm reminded of some of E.L. Doctorow's early books. While Tinkers may remind me of Frost or Doctorow, there is no doubt that Harding has found his own unique voice. It is a strong one that I'm sure will be around for many years.
1433503794|5.0|Pros:  I just recieved my study bible in the mail EARLY.   Packaging was awesome, completely undamaged.   There is so much material I cant wait to dive into.  Con:  (this is the only one)The cover is not as supple as I hoped it would be. Has much more of a glossy plasticy feel than I would have expected.(I ordered the portfolio design)  I will post another review once I've gotten to dive in!
0312370849|4.0|I finally settled on 4 stars but only reluctantly.  Much has already been written about the book in other reviews - I've only just read it but find I don't have much to add.  There are two stories going on here - Sarah's story of 1942 and Julia Jarmond's story 60 years later.  I ended up giving the book 4 stars only because of the story of 1942 - it is compelling and written well and because it has focused on an almost forgotten event in French history, the Vel d'Hiv.    But, the Julia Jarmond story borders on lame.   I doubt I would recommend this to anyone except for the first half of the book that includes Sarah's story.    It is simply not enough to have a compelling idea - it must be written well, too, and the second half of the book is not all that interesting except to find out what happens to Sarah later in life.  The whiney-ness of Julia's marital problems became a burden.  The author wrote with such clarity of purpose and so compellingly in the 1942 chapters in the first half of the book and then literally changed her style for the chapters about Julia.   Not a bad technique - the author just didn't make it work very well for this story.
B000007ODY|5.0|Along with the music of Richard Wagner, the music of Johannes Brahms was among the last  onof the great composers that I came to appreciate.  I knew that Herbert von Karajan rarely made a bad recording, so when I saw this in the store I knew that I had a great deal on my hands.     In order to appreciate Brahms, one has to appreciate rich color and texture.  Karajan does a fine, fine job of bringing these two aspects to the fore in this recording.  It's small wonder that he was the best selling classical artist of all time.  Superior conducting from him, even though this was late in his career.      The Berlin Philharmonic plays with an incredible amount of passion in this recording, especially the strings.  Berlin is one of a few orchestras in the world where all sections of the sections of the ensemble are equally great.      Now for recording quality.  This is very, very good late analog sound, and each of these works is captured beautifully.  DG's sound is as clear as ever.  The Berlin Philharmonie is one of my favorite concert halls as well.  Its excellent acoustics put it on a par with the Royal Concertgebouw's Hall in Amsterdam.    If one wants just one set of Brahms symphonies, I would wholeheartedly recommend this recording to them.  Great music, great sound, and  an even greater price.    Bravi tutti!
0375842209|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written about anything but was compelled to do so about this book. Hans Hubermann should go down as one of the greatest characters ever written.  It simply cannot be put down. I don't think I have ever wept so hard at the end of a book ever (don't let this throw you off, you will be happy you read it).  I agree with a previous reviewer, everyone should read this book. Hans, Rudy, Max, Liesel's and even Rosa's compassion and survival skills during this period of time are so heart-touching, their un-selfish acts are the enigma of the human soul during the time of war.  You will never be disappointed that you read this book.  Kudos to my sisters book club for recommending this book.
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Since I don't buy too many CD's these days, I remember standing      in the checkout line wondering if I was wasting my money. It turns       out I wasn't. \\"By the Sword\\" is the song that got my attention, but      the entire album, which ranges from mellow to heavy, is worthwhile.      Listening to this record I wonder why more artists don't do this       kind of thing. Nothing revolutionary here, just great songs. The Iggy      Pop song that closes the album I can see becoming a party anthem.
B000002HRE|5.0|Well Well Well!!! So many poeple were expecting Metallica to come out with a reinvention of RTL. Well folks this isn't The 80's and there are not 24 anymore. Load and Re-load were great especially re-load so what if it is not speed thrashy stuff it is more made to listen to and poeple this was not a hard album there are mistaken. Anyways I highly recommend this one if you like borderline hardrock with heavy riffs.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|From the \\"Fields of Gold\\" to \\"O America\\" This is a wonderfully done Celtic Woman CD. Alex, Chloe, Lisa, Lynn and Mairead show such passion with each song.

0385528752|5.0|In my mind there are two forms of non-fiction books on the market. The gimicky and the genuine. One glance at the average rating of Switch will tell you that this piece is the real deal.<br /><br />In a nutshell, switch is basically a thesis in how to effect positive change. The authors target three must hit areas, the rider, the elephant and the path. The rider is the rational part of the human individual, cold analytical and intellegent the rider can direct our behaviour, but only when 'the elephant' or the emotional part of our being is in some form of agreement. The elephant (or our emotions are)is a powerful animal able to carry us far and with great power, but tends to be skittish and moody, and in particular gets anxious when travelling new paths. 'The path' is of course the road in which the rider and elephant walk on.<br /><br />The authors basic premise is that if you can direct the rider (yours or anyone elses) through clear, concise and attractive propositions, tame the elephant through enthusiasm, positive reinforcement and self esteem and make the path an easy road, then change can happen.<br /><br />'Change' includes any form of improvement from self, to organisational, to societal; throughout the book we see examples from fixing malnutrition in vietnam to improving the economy of small towns and getting up on time in the morning.<br /><br />Switch is an awfully good book written in witty plainspeak that doesn't float down from the ivory tower of academia or oversimplify things to the point of moronity. If you haven't already read this book you're missing out.
B002XZ62HK|5.0|I love this Celtic Woman Deluxe CD. It comes with bonus tracks from the DVD Song of the Heart \\"The Call\\" and \\"Finale / Mo Ghile Mear\\". Plus to get a really nice 18 month calender that have pics from the Songs of the Heart concert and a heart charm as well. Alex, Chole, Lisa, Lynn and Mairead they do a wonderful CD. They sing with such PASSION whether they are singing solo or together, it is a wonderful blend of Irish and Celtic music. Several songs will move you to tears like Amazing Grace, Good Night My Angel (which is the best lullaby), My Lagan Love and O America!. God gives us all special gifts and these wonderful girls are sharing theirs with all of us.

I could not wait (and why should anyone who has seen this movie in the theaters) to buy this movie in 3D or the extended edition.  Also, I highly suggest watching this movie on an LED HD TV...so real you think you are looking out a window!!
B00371QQ2U|4.0|Apollo 13 looks great on bluray, but the bluray itself is a pain in the butt. There's too much crap to get to before you see the movie, and if you leave it paused for just a little while (God forbid you might have to pause a 2hr 20min film) the universal screen saver comes on and you can't unpause it, you have to go back to the main menu. DO BETTER NEXT TIME!!!
1401322425|5.0|A fantastic collection of recipes that really makes me excited to get back into the kitchen to cook real food. Though the book itself is a little intimidating (it looks and feels like a giant yearbook from school!), its chunky design somehow makes it more comforting. The only negative I found was that the gardening tips are very specific to the U.K., and when living in the southern U.S., they become a little less than useful. All in all, though, it really encourages you to get out there and try working with fresh, seasonal, local ingredients.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects are pretty good. Other then that do not buy this movie. I want 2 1/2 hours of my life back that I spent watching it.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Yep, a lot of purists are raging at the creative liberties taken in this movie, but as a long time Trekkie and certified ST Geek, I have to say that it far, far exceeded my expectations.    This is a masterpiece and I don't care how many disgruntled die-hards click their No buttons in response.    The casting was inspired and the story, production and direction were second to none.    I didn't think anyone could ever play the original cast so credibly, yet in every case, these fine young actors excelled across the board.    Nichelle Nichols was a sex bomb in the original series, yet Zoe Saldana managed to rise to job of portraying her in a modern context. Likewise Zachary Quinto was simply flawless as Spock, as was Chris Pine as Kirk.    This is essential viewing.
0061914177|4.0|great job w/the book Gary! I was watching your web 2.0 expo talk from 2008, and then navigated to your site and found the call-to-action buttons regarding your book.. i ordered it the next day on my Kindle and crushed through it in 2 days.. wow, great read! definitely lots of excellent quotes, thoughts, and inspiration to think big. I do agree that there is plenty of great content in here, and that people should take away the pieces that they feel will work best for them, and are applicable to them and their endeavors. keep hustling.

0385341008|5.0|The book was in pristine condition and arrived in a timely matter.  Very pleased.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I will be honest: the reason I got this movie was because A) I recently bought an LCD TV and a Blu Ray player and B) I've heard nothing but glowing reviews on the visuals in this movie.  So I figured, why not try out my TV/Blu-Ray with the best that exists?<br />John Sully (Sam Worthington) is a parapalegic Marine who comes late to Pandora and the Avatar project, run by Dr. Grace Augustine to study the Na'vi and get them to negotiate so the humans can mine for the highly coveted Unobtainium (yeah, I know, it's a weird name).  When John gets separated from his team, he ends up befriending Neytiri, the daughter of the chief of the clan.  Thrilled, the greedy humans tell John to penetrate the group and find out how to move them out of Home Tree so they can mine the Unobtainium.  But John not only learns from the Na'vi...he's beginning to grow to like them.<br />First off, the acting wasn't all that bad.  Sam Worthington was enjoyable as the lead, and I felt he did a good job going from Jarhead to Na'vi.  Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriquez, and Zoe Saldana were good to...but somehow, I feel that they were just doing what they've done elsewhere (I see this is Michelle, whose character here isn't much different from her character on LOST).  So, they aren't bad, but just aren't reinventing the wheel.  Not necessarily a problem.<br />The visuals, on the other hand, were astonishing.  It's still astounding to me to think that much of it wasn't real!  The movements, the skin, the surroundings, heck the animals and the weird floating mountains--all looked like a camera crew found somewhere in the world and were filming there!  I shudder to think how this would look on my old TV.<br />Unfortunately, the story is nowhere near as original as the visual effects, which is a pity.  It's [[ASIN:B0007KTBIU Pocahontas]] or [[ASIN:B0001JXOVC The Last Samurai]] or even a bit of [[ASIN:B00005JMOW Hidalgo]] (and those are only the ones I've seen, I've heard it also bear resemblances to [[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves]]).  Create a tech-savvy, militaristic society that wants something.  Add a noble race of savages who use bows and arrows.  Make the something the advanced society wants where the noble race lives and won't move, and you have yourself Avatar.  None of the characters--particularly the human marines and non-scientists--display any subtlety.  They are all gun-toting, tobacco chewing, tree burning, shoot-first-ask-questions-later red necks.  The most disturbing scene for me, is that none of the men and women who participated in destroying Home Tree ever exhibit one iota of regret, as they watch the trees burn, as they watch the Na'vi flee, as they see people die.<br />Would I recommend Avatar?  If you have an HD TV and Blu-Ray, I shouldn't even have to finish this: YES!  It's absolutely stunning, the wave of the future.  Sure, the story is meh, but honestly, just watching John soar on a pterodactyl-like beast is more than enough to counter it.  If, however, you plan on watching on a DVD, on your old TV, I would say no.  The story just doesn't make up for what you lose in visuals.<br /><br />NOTE: I had a brand-new Blu-Ray, a Samsung BD-C6500, and had to go online to find a work around (pressing STOP several times then hitting DISC MENU) because there was no new firmware so I could view the movie by just inserting into my Blu-Ray player.  Hopefully, this will quickly be remedied.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*Dances with Wolves]]).  Create a tech-savvy, militaristic society that wants something.

0061864153|5.0|A perfect coffe table book with a lot of pictures from all over and all ages of the band, a very nicely put interview wich covers pretty much all the Bon Jovi history, is a big book with not so much words but very complete. Not only for fans since is very well done in all the aspects.
0375836675|5.0|I am the Messenger is an excellent book that twists and turns as the reader tries to grasp the concept of what is going on. The characters are heartfelt and tear-worthy, especially the many people Ed Kennedy, the main character, changes the lives of. In the beginning, Ed stops a bank robbery and afterwards is sent a mysterious playing card in the mail with addresses on it. He follows the addresses, and his world is turned upside down. Along this journey, many people are saved, helped, and set free. This book is definitely worthy of any reader who likes almost any genre above the age of 13.    See More Reviews: [...]
0393072231|1.0|This book is an interesting read but ultimately goes astray. The narrative, at times hyperbolic, is interesting and accessible but the conclusion that \\"hypercapitalism\\", complexity and a desire to \\"f--- the poor\\" caused the financial meltdown is completely at odds with the facts (even with the facts presented earlier in the book).     The obvious true culprit was government directives from various places including fanny and freddie that encouraged loans to people who should never have gotten them and then labeled those loans with the best rating before selling them to bank investors who were over-trusting. When the loans started going bad, so did the banks who'd invested in them. The collapse was the fault of fanny, freddie, fiscally irresponsible government mandates and lazy investors who didn't check things out.    Read this book if you're interested in the stories of some of the people who managed to see the crisis coming, but be wary of the incompetent analysis of motives and over arching cause.
B002ZG9968|5.0|Real funny movie, one you would really lilke to see again. JLo is always good and Alex O'loughlin had the whole audience laughing.  He really is a scene stealer! I have already signed up to receive this movie when it is released on Amazon.
B002VECMAE|1.0|My wife and I saw the title and the trailer when it was just out in the theaters and thought it might be funny.  We like silly type humor every now and then (if it is clever) and the trailer seemed to promise some funny stuff.  We didn't catch it in the theater (lucky for us, we saved some money) -- we just recently rented it and watched it.  What a major waste of time.  We chuckled a couple times, but the rest of the time we just looked at each other and wondered why anyone would read the script and agree to act in it.  As someone else mentioned, after you finish watching the hundreds of other movies that are worth watching (maybe twice or three times), then consider watching this one.  Otherwise, use your time more wisely.  Maybe it's funnier if you spike your water with LSD before watching it? (it seemed to work for them in the final scenes)
B0012FO0DK|3.0|MASTER AND COMMANDER (2003) works best in its depiction of the relationship between a beloved ship's captain (Russell Crowe) and his crew. A dinner scene is particularly engaging, as are the cultured moments of violin and cello duets. Manueverings off the coast of South America between frigate HMS Surprise and the more formidible French vessel the Acheron are also most interesting.<br /><br />This film is a letdown however in the all-important boarding and hand-to-hand battle sequence. Shot with the shakiest of handheld cameras, it's absolutely impossible to follow what's going on, practically until the skirmish's outcome is decided. If the intention here was to baffle the viewer, this film's creators succeeded in my case. Yet, being served home movie quality smeary action after eagerly anticipating a thrilling swashbuckler of cutlass, dirk and bludgeon is just very unsatisfying to this sea adventure fan.<br /><br />In all other regards, \\"M & C: The Far Side Of The World\\"  is a fine motion picture.
0375434526|5.0|I bought this paperback edition of the Lost Symbol; everything is OK but I would prefer a smaller size like the previous books of Dan Brown which takes less space while travelling.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I ordered Avatar on a Thursday, and it arrived the following Monday, which is very fast. I loved the movie, which looks superb on a 1080p set. I don't have a surround sound system yet so I can't comment on the sound, but even out of 2 speakers it's nice. I don't really care about extras, and the lack of them is not worth taking a star off.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Even if you have most or all of Leonard Cohen's recordings you must add this one to your collection. It surpassed my expectations, which were high. Part of it is that I just love this man and his music, but even putting my sentimental heart aside, the beauty of these arrangements will take your breath away. You will hear his songs as if you are hearing some of them for the first time! Lush, emotional, heartfelt, wry, witty; it is all here, like opening so many gifts as you listen.<br />This CD,along with the Eagles, Long Road Out of Eden, are the two I want to take with me on any road trip.<br />Added much later: Now that I have seen him in concert (Toronto in December 2012) I cherish this recording even more!

B000005J08|4.0|Naked City, the term, is a 1950s one: it was a cop show. When you see the two words, you think of smokestacks, fedoras, chain smoking detectives, shadows on walls. Back when the city was about the diner, not the Starbucks.<br /><br />John Zorn's 1980s album does not invoke that that, nor is it a parody of 1950s urban or crime jazz.<br /><br />Zorn's Naked City uses 1980s loft jazz elements, metallic textures, to create a modern abstraction of the old cliche. There is not  a vibraphone a mile from Naked City. The trenchcoat is no where to be found.<br /><br />But Zorn works a tongue in cheek suite around the idea of dark ally life. \\"Bloodduster,\\" for example, is so self-consciencely over-the-top, you can't help laugh and admire how broadly Zorn is drawing the skyline.<br /><br />There are other places to go for true retro music--mainly to the  1950s scores themselves. But for great loft jazz with post-modern kicks, you can't get much better than this.
B000WCCUZO|5.0|I first heard Enter Shikari off the game Maden NFL 08. I never expected them to become my favorite band. After i heard OK, Time for Plan B, i thought if i like one song i'll probably like more! I downloaded a few more songs and they were all masterpieces! Mothership, Enter Shikari, Sorry You're Not A Winner. I finally decided to buy the album. I stopped by a local record store and they dont carry Enter Shikari so i requested an order. I got the album and i listened to it all afternoon. I just love how the songs progress and there are many different genres of music in it! They soon became my favorite band and Take To The Skies became my favorite album. They're new music is not near as good as the 2007 Enter Shikari. They are still my favorite band, and they're new stuff is pretty good, but compared to Take To The Skies, it sucks! Best band, best album!! (In my opinion of course)
0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages is one of the best relationship books that I've ever read - and I've read alot!  What I liked so much is that it allows us to learn, on another level, how to communicate and appreciate our loved one.  I realized so many missteps in my own relationships as it related to letting my spouse know how I loved him.  It's simple, it's true and it's so helpful for those who are building a relationship, strengthening a relationship or trying to save one.  You won't regret adding this to your library and your life.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|So I get home and set this up in less than 5 minutes.  I got it working, everything is great.  But first I start to notice the awful white noise, that low hissing sound that just won't go away.  Second and truly the reason I returned it was that occasional popping / cracking every now and then in my ear.    It was TOO much drama for a $200 wireless device.  When it wasn't cracking and I was too distracted to hear the hissing, the sound was awesome!  The occasional sound distractions just killed it for me at this price.  Go back to the drawing board boys.      Yes, I turned off near by wireless, downgraded my wireless to G vs. N, etc...  To much RF interference where I live.  Pop-Pop!!!
0375842209|5.0|Markus Zuska did an amazing job writing this one of a kind book. He gives the reader an in depth description of the time Liesel (the main character) was living in. He creates an abundant amount of emotion, and by the end of the book you realize how tremendous of an effect this world war had on every German, Jew, and child. Through Zuska's writing it is as if you are standing right in the middle of all the raids and mischief. This novel has many depressing touching moments in it yes. But, Zuska also includes many funny and romantic moments between two young children. Rudy risks his life for Liesel on many different occasions but yet never gets anything for being such a hero. Zuska takes the readers mind off of how terrible things were by telling cute love story on the side. This book was absolutely amazing! I loved this book so much. I usually do not like to read. I usually find reading to be very boring because books usually cannot catch my attention and keep it. The Book Thief was a 100% completely the opposite. There was never a chapter that I was bored, and I never once wanted to place the book down. The topic of the book being the era of World War II made me very interested. Zuska made history, something that never interested me, interested me for the first time. The only thing that I would criticize about this book would be that I did not enjoy the ending. It kind of seemed like Zuska ran out of ideas to write and just ended it too quickly. I think that there could have been a few better ways to end the book. Towards the end of the book you will find yourself completely depressed. Other than that though, it was an amazing book. This book had a serious tone, and a serious message along with it. It is definitely a MUST BUY!
B000FVNX2Q|1.0|I ordered a Platinum HP-12C.  The item that arrived was essentially a regular HP-12C with Platinum printed on it, but it wasn't a Platinum in any other sense.  A real disappointment.  If I had time I would return it and get the real thing.
B0033B5XCS|1.0|As has already been said, Jackie is not in any of these films, yet there he is on the cover. I have no doubt that he'll be amazing as Freddy, we'll have to wait and see about the film itself, but I have the feeling that (imo)it will turn out like the F13 remake. Derek Mears as Jason was great, the movie not so much... the Nightmare Encyclopedia has been replaced with Freddy vs Jason. Not that I dislike it, Robert Englund is excellent as usual, but this isn't even the 2 disc version. Do yourself a favor and scoop up the first dvd box set. It'll probably be forced out of print. Not cool, Newline.
B002SJIO54|5.0|I had heard from so many people that this was a great movie, but I was a little apprehensive to see it since I don't watch too many sci-fi movies. I was convinced by the diversity of the people who enjoyed it. No matter what their movie taste, I hadn't heard a bad review. I just watched it and cannot agree more. The effects were great. The acting was great. The storyline was just so original and creative. Every aspect of the movie was brilliant. I have not seen \\"Hurt Locker\\" so I can't say if this should have beat it out for the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar. However, I believe \\"District 9\\" would be much more deserving than \\"Avatar.\\" I was extremely pleased with this movie. Give it a chance.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I am very pleased of the Amazon delivery system. All the estimates was respect and I receive the product in the exact predict date.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|There is no doubt that all the special effects in this film were ground breaking. However, I had heard that this was the best thing since Star Wars which it is absolutely not. The story line wasn't original enough to be given that title. Very predictable. I enjoyed it, but I was not included in the group of people angered that it did not win the Best Picture Oscar. It did not deserve it. Worth a watch, but, in my opinion, a little overrated.
0891419063|5.0|Totally captivating, honestly written account of the author's WWII experiences. I had the feeling of being side by side with him witnessing his experiences - it is that good. The HBO \\"PACIFIC\\" miniseries uses significant events from this book (some details changed) with an actor portraying Sledge (the book's author).
B003405MF6|2.0|I am a big fan of Jeff Beck and have been since the original Jeff Beck Group with Rod the Mod.  I have every album since and have seen him many times.  Once I even got to exchange Hellos with him in a hotel lobby.  Since he changed management he has had a real jolt in his positive presence on the music scene.  That's good.  After several listenings it is too bad Jeff Beck is featured on this CD as if he is a guest artist.  That's the price of making a mainstream Jeff Beck CD.  He is really toned-down on this one.  Sitting through the sappy orchestra trying to pick out the guitar is not a pleasure for me.  String arrangements suitable for an elevator.  Ugh!  But even worse is Joss Stone. Bobby Tench, Jimmy Hall and Beth Hart I can dig.  Joss Stone?  Leave me out.  Can't stand the faux soul she pushes.  That's what record companies do when they want to sell to the masses. Congrats to Jeff Beck for the increased visibility and success.  Too bad for me there's not much on this CD for me to enjoy.  Takes me back to the \\"Jeff\\" CD he put out years ago.  A real clunker.  With all that said I would still crawl a mile over broken glass to hear him tune he low E to an E flat over the phone.  Peace Out!
B0036JU6CY|5.0|I thought it was a great flick.  Definitely a modern spin on classic ninja movies and the Ninja tradition.  Kind of bloody if you don't like that, but more realistic than other \\"bloody\\" movies.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|Sherlock Holmes' legacy got killed by this movie. It could've been much better, but it wasn't. For those old readers who love and know Sherlock Holmes, the movie was terrible. Even though it had Robert Downey Junior as Sherlock Holmes (which was wonderful, he really fits the character), some great scenes and other good deductions that Sherlock Holmes made during the movie, it wasn't good enough to be a Sherlock Holmes film. The soundtrack was horrible (too much country music, which doesn't fit Sherlock Holmes in anyway). If you see the trailer, it may convices you to buy it, but it's foolish.     It was a nice idea to make a Sherlock Holmes with more action, but it didn't workout. Once the movie starts, you want to keep watching (after all, the beginning was nice), but after an hour, it gets boring and you lose the point of the film. Sherlock Holmes (not only the character, but everything in the movie) was too modern; of course it's during the XIX century, but the music, the fighting scenes, and the characters were too modern. I think that, once again, Hollywood tried to make something good of what already was and screwed up. For those who already read all other Sherlock Holmes' stories, the script was nice because it used old talks, like \\"Because I was looking for it\\" (\\"Silver Blaze\\"); \\"You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion\\" (\\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\\"); \\"Crime is common, logic is rare\\" (\\"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\\"); \\"My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems. Give me work\\" (The Sign of the Four); \\"It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely\\" (\\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\\"); \\"Data, data, data--I cannot make bricks without clay\\" (\\"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\\"), and \\"...one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts\\" (\\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\").       The director wastes time to talk about Watson's marriage. What does that got to do with the story, it's so childish. I hope that in the next movie (which has already been confirmed) the director, Guy Ritchie, changes. Instead of wasting time on action and comedy, the director and his crew should concentrate on more interesting subject to make the spectator interested and mystery.     I'm sorry to say the truth, but don't except much from the movie because you're going to let yourself down.
0312243022|5.0|I decided to re-read Woolf's Mrs Dalloway followed by Cunningham's The Hours so that I could better appreciate both works, but particularly Cunningham's reworking and development of Woolf's remarkable work.  What an excellent use of my time this was! Cunningham's novel is certainly strong enough to stand on its own two feet and rewards reading for its own sake - even if you've seen the film - but the two novels read sequentially added so many dimensions to the experience. Try it!
B003F3NDP8|1.0|Susan and Mike are together...Susan and Mike are apart. Susan and Mike date other people, ruining their lives in one way or another (emotionally breaking hearts, getting engaged, breaking off engagements, etc...) THEN....(bated breath)...Susan and Mike get back together again.<br /><br />The first season I felt was new and interesting until I realized it's just, like others have said, a prime time soap opera. I cruised through the channels the other day and came across the Spanish channel. Without having to speak the language I KNEW it was their remake of one of Desperate Housewives earlier episodes..you know the one where Susan happens to be locked out of her house naked and the object of her desire plumber/ex-con Mike happens to just show up the moment she tumbles into the bushes. I digress...they are all conniving, manipulative, indecisive, witches of Wisteria, who don't know what they have or appreciate their loved one's unless their is peril, death, or adultery involved. All I want to do is tell most of them to grow up...but what is worse is they are all well old enough to know better. Like many of the other akin lineup programming, everyone seemingly just sleeps with everyone or there is one unbelievably, but avoidable, extraordinary dilemma atop another at every turn. Gratuitous nudity, flirting, and \\"keep to themselves\\" neighbors don't really thicken a plot. Drown in it already and end this series.
0393072231|5.0|Mr Lewis tells it like is Is and Was with fantastic ability to make those derivative things Realy Understandable. It also reads like an Adventure Novel - but about real people, the few who were perceptive of what was happening and what would be the result, and the people who made millions and billions trading for banks and insurance companies in the derivatives market until it all went bust. What is horrible is knowing those traders walked away with their millions, leaving the trash heap behind them like piled up crap on top of homeowners who got caught in the crush. Don't miss reading this excellent book.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I've both read some of Jeff Lindsay's novels and viewed their interpretation on Showtime's Dexter. I love the concept of a serial killer of killers and the situations he puts himself into. A dark passenger that, although corrupting, has been geared towards vigilante justice...it's intriguing. Most of Dexter has been unraveled and evolved at this point; his past, his childhood, the relationship with his father, sister, etc...and now we see him in a father and husband role.<br /><br />I'm disappointed to hear that Michael C. Hall had to recently undergo treatment for cancer, but glad he's in remission and returned to film season 5. I'll be interested to see if it took a little steam out of the man portraying such a personality. I was a fan of his since 6 Feet Under, so I'm pleased he's still with us.<br /><br />Anyhow, this particular season focused on the family model; getting married, having a baby with Rita, being a step father to her kids. I won't voice spoilers here but I'm sure everyone is aware of how his marriage turns out. And of course Dexter has some cop on the force who gets a little too curious. We all know what happens to those.<br /><br />The show overall is clever, entertaining, and not always predictable. I hate shows and plots that I can easily foretell what will happen next. And I like that most of the material tries to stay near true (with a couple of changes here & there) to the novels (basic plot, characters, etc...) I'm interested to see which direction the show will go in now. I hope the (UNREAL) season end of this season wasn't just some strange dream/nightmare. But if it DID happen, I hope it doesn't \\"jump the shark\\" for this otherwise riveting series.
B0035J6TA8|4.0|Great alternative arrangements of these songs... they come to life in a surreal way, such contrasts with the original artists' version. Lush production.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|I am a Smooth Jazz fan big time. Prior to buying Live from the Inside I read some of the reviews which gave me an idea of what to expect.  I also went online and looked at the video for \\"Go\\". I was not disappointed when I received the CD/DVD. I loved the DVD so much that I invited my family over for a dinner and a concert.  The video was not only entertaining but informative.  You leaned what is considered when putting a live performance together for different venues.  The personal information about Brian Culbertson was also very interesting. The fact that this live concert was done in studio did not take away from the performance of the band. In fact, it was like a group of friends enjoying playing for themselves. For me, because you receive a CD and a DVD, the price you pay for this product is well worth it. I put the CD on my MP3 player. Try it you will like it.
1932100660|5.0|I was blown away by the amount of research put into The China Project, which became the basis for this text.  The results of the research are incredible--they go against what we learn is the standard American diet, indeed they go against so much that T.Colin Campbell was from his experience on the family farm to his early projects in graduate school.    Please read. I have heard that many people who have read this BUY a few to MANY extra copies to give away to family, friends, doctors. This is also what I did.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best I have read in awhile.  I had to put it down a couple times, because it was just too intense, but picked it right back up.  Def. a Laugh/Cry Love/Hate experience.  Loved it and think everyone should read it(esp dog lovers)!!!!!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has always conjured up Basil Rathborne or some other BBC production type image but this movie blows it away.  Guy Ritchie's version kicks butt and Robert Downey, Jr. has made Sherlock Holmes his own original character.  The acting, storyline and imagery contained in this movie are beautiful to watch.  Mind you, after two hours of viewing it made me wonder how long this movie was going to be but it never dragged.<br /><br />The bad guy is caught within minutes of opening credits.  It was to be the last job of Holmes & Watson before Watson settled down to a cozy married life.  Of course things do not go as planned and the duo has to step in to stop the forces of evil.  The plot is suitably sinister with a mysterious group (Free Masons anyone?) that becomes corrupted by a power hungry decendant who dabbles with the dark side. Does this sounds too formula?  Fear not, because Ritchie stirs things up with his love of action and off-beat humor.  There's the usual fighting scenes (the boxing match), the behemoth thug and lots of humor all mixed together (having Holmes try out various concoctions on the dog).  The love interest was thankfully light and the movie zipped by in beautifully hued images.  The cinematography is amazing.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was amazing and I highly recommend it.  Some fans of the old school Sherlock Holmes might not appreciate this updated version.  I would also recommend turning on the subtitles to fully enjoy the dialogue.
B0036TGSR6|1.0|Yes, the so-called \\"sophisticated\\" viewers are falling all over themselves to pronounce this movie another Polanski classic.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  It's an absolute bore with \\"surprise\\" plot that's not much of a surprise, \\"suspense\\" efforts that's totally suspense free and characters that are caricutures.  By the way, if you like Pierce Brosnon and expect great things from him in this movie, you'll be sorely disappointed.  Ewan, much like in Cassandra's Dream (another dud by another famous director), basically repeats that role.  This movie MAY have been an ok made-for-TV movie but to actually have to pay and sit through this mess, jeezz...  It's unfortunate that Polanski have to live up to the high standard set with the \\"Pianist\\" so maybe I'm being overly harsh.  You don't expect big box office success with movies like this BUT when this movies was dead on arrival at the theaters, it tells you something about how awful it is.  What a letdown!
B002ZFQD04|3.0|Madonna Louise Ciccone Ritchie has been on the frontline of beautiful live shows over the past 30 years or so. If you have been to her shows or watched her on TV or DVD, she is great, but in this one (recorded in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in front of 256 000 fans) she is not that spectacular as she seems to be running out of ideas! She is very predictable in her performances on this one if you have seen her previous shows (This concert concept is similiar to her previous shows). Despite her new love of mostly playing guitar (she recently learnt to play guitar) on this DVD concert, this is certainly not her strong point! Her shows can be better with some innovations to deliver a fresh live show different from her previous shows!New fans will enjoy this one, but old fans may wish for a better performance!
B0038VPB5W|3.0|Is this their major label debut? Sure seems like it had a huge impact on the quality of the songs and the generally crappy lyrics compared to previous efforts. Guitar work is still stellar especially on \\"Alone\\" and \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" but this album is definitely cringeworthy if you are paying attention to the lyrics. I wouldn't say that they phoned in these songs, but I don't see much of any progress from the last album and this is certainly their worst record. Very disappointed.
B00005NWLO|5.0|This is one of the best live albums ever.  It catches the pure raw talent of all the musicians.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|The movie is awesome!!!,however, I was expecting something more. The dvd is new, and in perfect condition, it's just that it's only one disc with not so many features. I guess I should buy the blu-ray version.

Now that ive read the girl who played with fire, i cant wait for the next one. Stieg Larsson is an excellent writer and I wish he was still alive cause I bummed hornets nest is the last salander novel. If you liked dragon tattoo you will love played with fire. It gets right into it and keeeps you hooked even beyond the last page. this one ends with where the next one begins.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick-Ass is based on Mark Millar's 2008 comic book of [[ASIN:0785134352 the same name]].  The story is adapted for the screen by director and producer Matthew Vaughn.  The film comes off as a tongue-in-cheek cross between some of the big budget American comic book based films of recent years and live action anime.  The action scenes, just like the film's many colorful characters and its outstanding soundtrack, ask to be taken seriously enough to care for its characters, but in the end are appealing enough as fiction to provoke the audience to laugh, cheer, and generally stay exciting from beginning to end.  The theater I was in gave a hearty applause to Kick-Ass when it ended, and that was deserved.  After all, who doesn't like it when drug-dealers get taken out by likable underdogs that the audience can generally empathize with.<br /><br />Kick-Ass follows high school age David (Aaron Johnson), an every-teenager who wonders why real-life superheroes don't exist.  This reminds me of a fantastic special on the Science Channel about how Batman could be real, but his life expectancy would be incredibly short, so there's David's answer I suppose.  Anyway, so David settles on becoming a superhero without powers; just a green wetsuit, some batons, a taser, and later some much more heavy duty weapons that would make the US armed forces envious.  Obviously this is a film that asks for some suspension of disbelief but to say David's evolution into superherodome is a hard road is an understatement.  He does meet some very interesting fellow superhero's along the way including Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his little eleven year old girl Mindy, or Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz).  Hit Girl brings the film's overall appeal to a whole other level and there is no doubt she will be a cult icon in years to come.  She curses at her opponents and then flips and dances around with her weapons in kind of a ballet of vengeance.  Legs are amputated, throats are slashed, and the back of heads are blown out all to the sound of the Dickies version of the Banana Splits Theme Song and Bad Reputation by, who else, the Hit Girls.  Finally, David meets fellow superhero newcomer Red Mist, who is complete with his own vehicle, the Mist Mobile.  Red Mist is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and is of course known most for his role as McLovin in the 2007 comedy [[ASIN:B000WZEZGI Superbad]], but if he didn't shake off type-casting as a nerdy Live Action Role Player in the underrated 2008 comedy [[ASIN:B001OD4S50 Role Models]], then he has done so here as Red Mist.  Mark Strong, who made [[ASIN:B001OQCV6A Sherlock Holmes]] a far better film as that film's antagonist, plays this film's antagonist Frank D'Amico, and does a fantastic job in taking his role just seriously enough. He's a great villain no matter the genre.<br /><br />Kick-Ass has perfectly timed humor to hopefully place the violence of the film's action scenes into a different lens for its audience.  It's not easy to defend violence in a movie that is clearly trying not to be taken seriously unless the violence is used as comedy itself, and here that can certainly be argued.  Firstly, in several ways, Kick-Ass is a movie about revenge so the violence has some emotional purpose, however flawed the characters may be for employing it.  Secondly, the violence comes off as a cross between Japanese animation and three stooges slaptick humor.  It is certainly a mix that made me laugh very much.  The humor in the film is also strong in its dialogue and the general actions of its unique characters.  The cast seems to get it and I have no doubt that Mark Millar, who wrote the original comic book, was working very closely with Matthew Vaughn in making this a pure effort with every single detail fully understood.  Everyone working on the film was very likely on the same page.  Highly recommended, especially to those who can really appreciate it, and to those who think it might be kind of a family film because oneof its most visible characters is an eleven year old girl, think again.sible characters is an eleven year old girl, think again.
B002LLE3Q8|5.0|One of my first memories of \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" was listening to it at a dance club on the Jersey Shore in the early 1970's called \\"Le Garage\\".  While everyone danced with black light and  psychedelic colors projecting around, they played this music as they showed clips of science fiction movies on a big screen.  I remember this song being played to the finale of \\"This Island Earth\\" and it has stayed with me till today.  The remastering and remixing is great.  The bonus stuff is okay but not why you should buy this wonderful recording.
0060007737|5.0|The feeling that constantly passed through my head while reading this was:\\"why didn't I do it earlier?\\".   From now it is on my top5 list and on my desk all the time.   And that is 'nough said.

1416511946|4.0|The bulk of the text is Nikki's actual journal entries taken from a year of a very dark time in his life, with various Motley Crue alumni interjecting with their opinions and viewpoints. It makes for compulsive but often quite uncomfortable reading, not so much because of the casual way he talks you through horrific experiences of hard drug addiction but because of things he did...I mean, I've always thought Nikki Sixx is one of the coolest people in rock/metal/whatever, but really you just find yourself putting the book down at times and thinking \\"this guy was a complete d*ckhead!\\"...the modern-day Sixx says as much himself towards the end of the book. He seems to have undergone a dramatic personality change following the events described in this book, thankfully.<br /><br />It's not unlike reading Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", there's something horribly fascinating about it. I was very glad that there's some kind of redemption at the end of it all - Sixx got married (several times) and has a family that he obviously thinks the world of, and even mended fences with his mother and his long-suffering Crue bandmates.<br /><br />I think I'll go & check out the Sixx AM soundtrack...
B002T45VX6|5.0|Seriously, at the begining when I heard  Shakira going electro, I was like EEEWWW please NO!    But at the end I've realized there is just like 20% of   Electro music mixed with 80% of Latin,Arabic and Indian Music.    And she did it amazingly well!    She Wolf is hated or loved  but the song has so weird but great lyrics, it's  typical Shakira thing.    Gypsy is a sweet ballad with many different instruments.    Mon Amour is a rock Shakir song.    Did it Again is hard to describe, I really like the lyrics.  Speciaklly the Spanish version sounds amazing.    Give It Up To Me is a Timbaland produced song,  commercial yet sounds good!    Spy featres Wyclef Jean, sounds like a song from '80s.  Pretty cool.    Men In This Town is the hidden highlight of the album  and is like most of the electro, but it just sounds extremly  cool and includes the weird Shakira lyrics.    All in all, the album is really good.  To say Shakira went mainstream is maybe 50% right.  But She put her own style into the mainstream music  adding a lot of different instruments and sounds from different  countries.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|Paramore are a strange band in that they seem to have appeared in the mid Noughties fully formed, as if they were hatched or something...what I mean is, there is very little difference in the content of any of the three studio albums they have so far released, or much evidence of any musical progression. I think I like this album the least of the three; All We Know Is Falling was a punchy and confident debut that showcased the band's sound, while Riot boasted superior songwriting. Brand New Eyes (crap title) sees Paramore having a stab at some quieter acoustic passages in places, but basically it's business as usual except not quite as good as before. Whether that floats your boat is really going to depend on whether the previous albums did. Brick By Boring Brick and Decode are probably the standout tracks, and Decode has already appeared on the soundtrack to the first Twilight film some time ago.<br /><br />Having said all that, there is still plenty of good material on here and I love Hayley's voice as much as ever. It's so gratifying to see a decent modern rock band with a female singer who doesn't try to sell the music on the back of her sexuality.<br /><br />It's a competent album, strong enough in places but not much here that the band haven't already done better before.
B003274QH6|5.0|From start to finish, this show delivers.  It's smart, well written, acted, directed, sets are perfect, etc.  All actors and actresses in the show perform to perfection.  If you like suspense, drama, comedy, and a good story, this show will provide all of that, and more.    Watching Breaking Bad in HD looks amazing.  The directors of this show really like telling the story beyond the script with what is shot, and HD does it justice.  If you haven't seen this show yet, watch it in HD (blu-ray).
B000007T1M|4.0|I unearthed this from my cd collection the other day, looking for something that I hadn't played in years that would blow my socks off. Good choice!!<br /><br />I bought this album along with Toxicity at a time when it was apparently compulsory to like this band (early Noughties), and while I soon got bored of Toxicity I always came back to this one. This album is much more consistent than Toxicity, and basically showcases everything that the band were capable of. It's also the heaviest album by quite a long way, which may put off some people who are more familiar with the later stuff.<br /><br />Stand-out songs are Sugar (obviously), Know, and Spiders (from which Ariels sprung, by the sound of it).<br /><br />Yeah, they were hyped beyond belief later on, and their postmodern wacky cartoon metal started to grate a bit, but for my money this is a System Of A Down album that I'm still happy to own. Maybe you will be too, if you don't already.
B000005JA8|5.0|This is simply the most amazing album I have ever heard. I cannot stop listening to it (I'm listening to it right now). This is truly Captain Beefheart's best work. For all those out there who fear that this album will just be a barrage of caccophonous noise and cryptic mumblings, fear not. The album is actually full of catchy tunes and amusing lyrics. It was not \\"hard listening\\" for me at all. After 3 listens I was hooked. You'll be fine as long as you've learned to appreciate some of Beefheart's other work, such as Safe As Milk, or Ice Cream for Crow.    Side 1: A good start to the album. Frownland takes no prisoners and shows that Beefheart is doing stuff his own way. Ella Guru is a great song and incredibly catchy (the country-like chorus is unexpected and so funny). Hair Pie:Bake 1 gets cookin' if you can get through the first minute and a half.    Side 2:My favorite side. Pachuco Cadaver is my favorite song on the  entire album (A squid eating dough in a polyethalene bag is fast and bulbous. Got me?)Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish is incredibly wierd and touching at the same time. Dali's Car is pure instrumental joy.    Side 3:A jumbled enjoyable side. Hair Pie:Bake 2 is even beter than Bake 1. When Big Joan Sets Up has a great riff throughout. Sugar and Spikes is just great in an unexplainable sense. Ant Man Bee just feels good.    Side 4: A stunning finish. Orange Claw Hammer is a great story. Steal Sofly Thru Snow has literary greatness. And Veteran Day's Poppy has possibly the greatest coda in the history of the world.    Just buy this album and put it on with an open mind. You won't be disappointed.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The first time I ever heard \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" I was 15 and it absolutely blew me away. It was all too much - the slyly witty lyrics, the strident bark of Jagger's delivery, the creepy ambience...and when the indecently distorted guitar solo kicked in it was the coolest thing I'd ever heard. It more than deserves its reputation as one of the Stones' finest hours, and repeated listening does nothing to dull the magic. And that's just the first track.<br /><br />The rest of the album is stuffed with tremendous songs, from the beautifully wistful \\"No Expectations\\" to the yearning lyricism of \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" to the strutting classic \\"Street Fighting Man\\" to the seamy celebration of the joys of jailbait that is \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" (these were more innocent times), the Stones could do no wrong on this record. It's that rare thing, an album that sounds so damned amazing on a first listen that you know you've just found a new friend for life.<br /><br />Along with \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile...\\" this is one of my all-time Stones favourites, and if you've never experienced its seedy pleasures then you're in for a treat. Enjoy!!
0061885452|5.0|I won't repeat what so many others have already said, but wanted to add my 5-star vote to the group here.    American On Purpose by Craig Ferguson is well worth reading, regardless of whether or not you are a fan of his television work. Although I'd say that its title says a lot about it, it's also a book that's educational, inspiring, honest, and thoroughly entertaining - all wrapped up together and written in Mr. Feruson's trademarked down-to-earth style. That makes it, at least for me, one of the very best modern autobiographical works that I've ever read, PERIOD. Once I picked it up I just could not seem to put it down.    If you are even just considering this book, BUY it. You'll love it!

0440243688|5.0|While riding a NYC subway early in the morning, Reacher spots a woman, Susan Mark, who looks to be a potential suicide bomber. Pretending to be a cop, he tries to talk her out of detonating the bomb. Feeling pressured the lady pulls out a gun and kills herself. Reacher's appraisal of the woman being a bomber was wrong. Feeling guilty and curious, Reacher tries to find out what made her suicidal and quickly gets in trouble with the Feds, Cops and the bad \\"guys\\" that were extorting her to steal information from the DoD.    The main plot is a little slow to develop but its not boring for the author uses Reacher's logic to find a potential target of the exhortation plot and the Feds will go to great lengths to protect him from Reacher. The person of interest is Sansom, an ex Delta Force, who went on a black op in 1983 and he and the government wants that op kept secret.  While ignoring and evading the Feds, Reacher slowly learns the truth about the senator wannabe (Sansom) and the culprits (Hoths) who ignited this plot. The progression is deliberate but interesting.    I've admired Child's logic, knowledge and talent in developing his suspenseful stories. In this story finding the ex soldier, estimating where the terrorist crew is hiding out, describing Manhattan in good detail, teaching us how to fight against brass knuckles or knives is just a sampling of what's in store for the reader. I also like the author's fascination with numbers and numerical relationships.  He also shows the scary tactic by our government dispensing the rule of habeas corpus for the sake of \\"national security\\". The Patriot Act allows our government to break the law at their wish. Reacher could have been locked away for years without due process for being interested in this case.  As in many of his other books, there isn't much romance. There is one paragraph just before he goes to battle with the bad \\"guys\\" that he takes Theresa Lee to bed but don't blink or you'll miss it.  While there is some fighting, killing and gruesome torture scenes, its not gratuitous or excessive. There is not as much action in his later books as with his earlier books. From my perspective, this story is more cerebral as Reacher outthinks the Feds, cops while unraveling the truth and eliminating the lies while hunting down the terrorists all at the same time.  In the final chapter, Reacher makes a mistake that almost costs him his life when he underestimates the competition. The mistake makes for a more exciting ending but it's a mistake you don't expect Reacher to make and that was a little disappointing.  Providing just a glimpse into this fine book, without giving away the whole story, I highly recommend this book. Its one of Mr Child's best.
B000002P2V|2.0|Who are you to be messing with a classic Who recording? The boys at MCA have managed to destroy Who Are You by remixing the entire album. Gone is the subtle triple coda to &#34;Guitar And Pen&#34; as well certain important orchestral arrangements heard on the original release (case in point the horn section on &#34;Had Enough&#34;). The sound quality is not noticeably different either. The only good things are the addition of two bonus tracks and liner notes with pictures. The alternate versions included are not substantially different to warrant their inclusion. Tips: Find a used copy of the original CD release to experience this great album in its original glory.

1582701709|3.0|There is no secret to The Secret.  This book does not teach anything new.  It's the same old positive thinking stuff that Napoleon Hill wrote about in 1937 in Think and Grow Rich and Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull in 1970 among many others.  Now, please understand, I agree that being optimistic and thinking positively is a very important aspect of living life to it's fullest.  But The Secret takes positive thinking too far; way to far!  In fact, this book is just downright negligent at times!<br /><br />The word \\"act\\" doesn't even appear in this book until page 46 and only then as an afterthought.  In fact, the book not only avoids suggesting individual action, it discourages it outright!  The concept of positive thinking as described in this book suggests that strong feelings and intractable faith in a universal power will mysteriously manifest our thoughts into reality.  Whatever we want, we need only ask for it and then simply act as if we already have it.  And if our faith is strong enough and our emotions are completely devoted to the cause, the things we want will just magically appear.  And if you don't get what you want, well you just didn't have enough faith.  I'm sorry, that's called a cop-out!<br /><br />Oh, but it gets worse!  Regardless of whether I believe in the precepts of positive thinking to that degree, I must point out the incredibly ridiculous, and in my opinion, criminally negligent lengths The Secret goes to when citing examples of the supposed power of positive thinking. In an era when obesity is the number one killer of Americans, killing over 400,000 people a year, you would think that a modern day author would be very careful about what they wrote concerning food and weight gain.  But in the face of undisputed research by the Centers for Disease Control which reveals that sixty five percent of American adults are overweight (that's two out of every three people!), Rhonda actually has the audacity to write<br /><br />\\"Let go of all those limiting thoughts.  Food cannot cause you to put on weight, unless you think it can.\\"<br /><br />Unless you think it can?!!! Is she out of her mind?!  You will only get fat if you think you will?!  Otherwise, pig out and think thin thoughts.  You'll be okay!  Don't worry about all those other dead obese people!  They had a lack of faith!<br /><br />The Secret is just the same old stuff wrapped up in a pretty box.  Those who teach positive thinking offer a very useful tool to help people live their lives effectively, but they miss the mark completely.  Positive thinking is not the end-all-be-all, it is merely the beginning.  As long as you keep that in mind, I can recommend this book.  It is, after all, the best pretty wrapped example of positive thinking ever written.<br /><br />Scott A.

B0009QZ4CO|5.0|Anybody interested in Van der Graaf Generator is urged to buy this album and Godbluff.    When Van der Graaf Generator reformed in 1975, they had a new, more focused approach. Unlike earlier albums such as Pawn Hearts or H to He, no song seems longer than it needs to be. Their musicianship also seems stronger than other records.    Each track on Still Life has cohesive lyrics and great melodies. My favorite lyric: \\"Take away the treat of death and all you're left with is a round of make believe\\" (from Still Life).    [DW]
B0034JKZ86|3.0|Some disney movies stay with me forever but this one didnt quite do anything for me. I guess it was the hype of being the first african princess that attracted me. Music didnt stick well with me and I could hardly care about the voodoo, since living in the south Im use to seeing it. Having magic, black magic and or voodoo, most disney movies have this theme, example: Aladdin, little mermaid,sword in the stone,snow white*which I didnt like*...and murder lets not forget murder.*lion king* You need a villan and Dr. Facilier was perfect. He just takes advantage of the human weakness of the heart and mind. But the good thing about some movies, it only shows that in the end evil never wins.  Naveen reminded me of the frog for that swan princess movie *which didnt do anything for me*   Besides that, it was an okay movie. Music was so so and the general plot was somewhat humourous. I found it cute when the firefly was in love with a star. When Tiana was so upset about being a frog, I thought she was still cute.<3 I dont see how else the plot of the frog prince could of been any different. Hm, I wonder if disney will make a hispanic princess.

B000001FXR|5.0|It's important to note that reggae music did not exist before the Aston (drums) and Carlton Barrett (bass) came up with it in 1971-72. Just as Benny Benjamin (drums) and James Jamerson (bass) defined the Motown Sound a decade earlier, the Barrett brothers created the distinctive one drop sound which made The Wailers sound different from their contemporaries in Jamaica. Prior to The Wailers, Ska was the dominant Jamaican style. The Wailers' Catch a Fire is a fusion of expert musicians and great, politically- and socially-charged lyrics delivered by the two most important Jamaican singers (Bob Marley and Peter McIntosh). While Bob Marley never went \\"soft\\", the songs he recorded between 1972 and 1974 have the hardest hitting lyrics. Combine that with the inventive Barrett brothers and you have a masterpiece.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|I came into this movie expecting the greatest film of our time. I was a little disappointed in the final result. The movie is good no doubt about it, but not worthy of the top spot in box office history. The aliens and Pandora look amazing. It must have taken years to render all of these scenes out and they look fantastic. The movie itself takes a little too long to get moving. It just sits there and slowly puts the pieces together. It would have been given a five star rating had the plot been developed a little faster. The movie lasts for two and a half hours. I think they could have taken at least a half an hour out in the middle to make the move flow better. I hear that there is going to be a version that is forty minutes longer, and that just shocks me. I thought that it was too long as it is. The characters are pretty well developed and the story itself is nicely finished when the credits roll. It takes a little too long for the main character to learn all the customs of the Pandoran people. I just would have liked the movie to turn against the aliens quicker. It takes too long for the evil humans to try and destroy them. It was a good movie and I recommend it to sci-fi fans, but don't go into it expecting the greatest film of all time you will just be disappointed.

B001IBIHQ4|2.0|I've been talking a lot about this series a lot with friends and there is a really interesting point to discuss, as several other reviewers have already started to do. The way sex is depicted in it degrades it in so many ways.     We in this country tend to feel that violence is more acceptable for our youth to see than people \\"making love.\\" I think that idea is completely backwards, and I am about the biggest action/war film fan around. But, for these types of films (Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, The Pacific - even Schindler's List while we're on the subject) there should perhaps be a different standard.    Yes, these films are made for and intended to be seen by adults; but they are also \\"event\\" films that generate huge attention and word of mouth, especially among the young. They are touted as being historically accurate and true. They are also without a doubt the perfect vehicles to introduce young people into the experiences of their forefathers. The patented \\"Spielberg\\" approach to this material is unbelievably effective at getting viewers to relate to and in some small way experience the individual reality of these world changing events. It practically forces you to get involved, to feel just a bit of what is was like for them, God forbid - to CARE about your country's history and those that made it.     I for one, feel that Saving Private Ryan should be viewed by young people when they are emotionally ready for the violence but, even more importantly, for the CONTEXT of the horrible violence. They should be able to understand WHY those young boys are enduring that hell and fighting and dying. Romantic views of WWII aside, young people should understand not so much what the country was fighting for, but for what it was fighting AGAINST. I feel the same is true of Band of Brothers. But, to me, even the quick sex scene at the end of Band of Brothers is gratuitous and unncessary in it's depiction. It makes one give pause when considering showing the scene or episode to young people. That's unfortunate because they should be able to see it in it's entirety.    Here's why. Yes, in WWII the soldiers (like all soldiers) had sex. In Europe, a lot of them had a lot if sex especially at that stage of the war (Spring 1945). It is history, truth, honesty, the human condition, whatever you want to call it. Soldiers have sex. There is a place for sex and love in these stories that should not be ignored or glossed over, but the \\"style\\" these productions use in depicting it is graphic and raw. It does feel \\"cheap\\" and gratuitous. It unavoidably bursts open the door to a whole different conversation that parents might not feel young people are ready for. It could be depicted so much more \\"tastefully\\" and it would be a non-issue. The adults would understand what was happening. Younger viewers would either miss it or ignore it, or at least not be confronted with it so shockingly, and the matter would be over. By giving the viewers scenes of raw graphic sex, the producers force thoughtful adults to second-guess showing these otherwise masterful historic and cultural truths to the young people who are the ones most desperately in need to learn about and remember them.    This is ESPECIALLY true of The Pacific. It fails to develop the characters to any degree of emotional resonance. It fails to give a concise yet explanatory view of the \\"Big Picture\\" of context of the events. Worst of all, it cheapens the experiences and sacrifices of millions of Americans (and their Allies) by diverting attention from the World Changing endeavors they embarked upon, and the staggering endurance and bravery they exhibited, to repeatedly show them in lurid sexual situations.    I, for one, am VERY disappointed in it.
B000000HTO|5.0|Anybody interested in Van der Graaf Generator is urged to buy this album and Godbluff.    When Van der Graaf Generator reformed in 1975, they had a new, more focused approach. Unlike earlier albums such as Pawn Hearts or H to He, no song seems longer than it needs to be. Their musicianship also seems stronger than other records.    Each track on Still Life has cohesive lyrics and great melodies. My favorite lyric: \\"Take away the treat of death and all you're left with is a round of make believe\\" (from Still Life).    [DW]

1400052173|4.0|For those of you who have not heard the story of Henrietta Lacks, Henrietta was a poor young black woman who descended from slaves. She grew up in Virginia and later moved to Maryland. She was a wife and the mother of five small children who died of cervical cancer in 1951.<br /><br />Prior to her death when she was undergoing treatment at John Hopkins, doctors removed cells from her cervix, but not for biopsy. The doctors already knew that her cancer was malignant.  Her cells were removed without her knowledge for research purposes. The cells were named HeLa cells (using the first two letters of her first and last names). This book is about Henrietta, her family, and especially her daughter Deborah, who never really got to know her mother who died prematurely at the age of 31.<br /><br />A research scientist named George Gey was working with other scientists on cell reproduction, when he came across Henrietta's cells which he quickly witnessed growing and growing at an amazing rate. The cells were reproduced over and over in a controlled laboratory environment. Over the years the famous HeLa cells have resulted in scientific advancements in certain types of cancers, polio, Parkinson's diseases, genetic cloning and other medical advances.  Over the years scientists have grown over 50 million metric tons of HeLa cells which have been used all over the world by scientists.<br /><br />The author, Rebecca Skloot learned about Henrietta's cells in a Biology class, and became obsessed with learning more.  After much resistance on the part of the family to cooperate, the author eventually gains Deborah's trust, and together the two interview friends, relatives, visit family homesteads and burial grounds to learn more about Henrietta's life. They even visit Johns Hopkins to see the \\"amazing\\" cells, and investigate the early death of Henrietta's daughter Elsie, who was sent to a mental hospital after her mother's death.<br /><br />Henrietta's story is truly amazing, but it also brings up all sorts of legal and medical ethics issues for debate.  The author does a wonderful job leaving the reader with a deeper understanding of the issues on both sides of the fence. The book was near perfect, and it is certainly an informative and worthwhile read. RECOMMENDED (RATING - 4.5/5 stars)legal and medical ethics issues for debate.

ANY man that would sell his soul for love is a raging DUMBA$$<br /><br />Nick was a serious WRONG choice for this--Chris Evans would have been the bomb choice or an unknown actor in his early 20's.<br /><br />I liked the plot but stick to the characters in the comic

1416500278|3.0|I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")<br /><br />Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).<br /><br />\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it.ger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true.

B001GCUER0|5.0|I had seen parts of some Season Two episodes on television before Season Three started.  Once I watched the Season One set I received for Christmas, however, I had to order Season Two.  This show contains some of the best writing found anywhere.  Fantastic performances.  Now my husband is hooked on the show, as well.
B0034JGBM0|3.0|I have been a fan of the white stripes since their inception my collection of cd's includes  all their cd's,as well as  the endeavours of jack in different groups.    I do believe that they are justifiably regarded as one of the best acts to have emerged during recent years,and i also do not dispute that their actual live performances are something to behold,(if one is lucky enough to have attended a concert).    Unfortunately this cd,like the majority of live cd's by other artists, do not do justice to the studio recordings of the same songs.    And this not the the band's fault.    It is just an unfortunate fact that live cd's are different,it represents a live concert where artists are normally improvising and the sound quality are normally lost on the recording.    If you are therefore purchasing the cd purely for completist purposes, go ahead.    In the alternative, rather purchase the original recordings and hear why the white stripes have made some of the best music of the decade.
032147404X|4.0|The focus of this book isn't technical detail and theory. It's a quick start intro to digital SLR photography, for people who are new to it. Kelby is straightforward and to the point. Experienced photographs may have different opinions than Kelby. Don't worry about that. This book is for beginners.  It's intended to give the reader a running start, with their new digital SLR.    Note: As a partner for Kelby's book, I bought Tom Ang's \\"Fundamentals of \\"Photography\\", which is all about technical details and theory. Kelby's book shows me what to do, and Ang's book can give me the background on why it worked.

It plays great and now I get to see my favorite band in concert whenever I want!
193413712X|4.0|I tend to avoid literary fiction, but I was curious about the 2010 Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction. For one thing, it's short: 191 smallish pages. And cheap: $8.22 at Amazon.com. The author used to be a musician --- drummer for a rock group called Cold Water Flat --- and I fancied he could still keep a beat.<br /><br />And then there's the back story. Rejection, rejection, rejection. Then a $1,000 advance from a tiny publisher. Champions appear. One gets the novel to a Pulitzer judge. Which leads to its unlikely win. And a cascade of happy announcements: a two-book deal with Random House (signed months before Harding won the Pulitzer) and a Guggenheim fellowship.<br /><br />So...is \\"Tinkers\\" all that and a bag of chips?<br /><br />With reservations: yes.<br /><br />It's not a traditional story, but how can it be? George Washington Crosby, its main character, is a dying old man, and the book follows his thoughts and memories as he's slipping away. And that means time is a Moebius strip --- a one-sided surface that bends and twists and has no mathematical orientation. Like this:<br /><br />\\"George Crosby remembered many things as he died, but in an order he could not control. To look at his life, to take the stock he always imagined a man would at his end, was to witness a shifting mass, the tiles of a mosaic spinning, swirling, reportraying, always in recognizable swaths of colors, familiar elements, molecular units, intimate currents, but also independent now of his will, showing him a different self every time he tried to make an assessment\\".<br /><br />Which is not to say the book swirls in an interior monologue worthy of Joyce. Harding is actually quite brisk about revealing facts and character:<br /><br />\\"He got a master's degree in education, counseled guidance in high school, went back north every summer to fly-fish with his poker buddies --- doctors, cops, music teachers --- bought a broken clock at a tag sale and a reprint of an eighteenth-century manual on how to fix it, retired, went on group tours to Asia, to Europe, to Africa, fixed clocks for thirty years, spoiled his grandkids, got Parkinson's, got diabetes, got cancer, and was laid out in a hospital bed in the middle of his living room.\\"<br /><br />But look how that paragraph starts:<br /><br />\\"One hundred and sixty-eight hours before he died, he sneaked into the basement window of the West Cove Methodist Church and rang the bell on Halloween night. He waited in the basement for his father to whip him for doing it. His father laughed so hard and slapped his own thigh, because George had stuffed the seat of his pants with old Saturday Evening Posts.\\"<br /><br />George's father Howard is a looming figure in these pages, and his character takes us back to 19th Century New England. Howard is the \\"tinker\\" of the title --- he was an old-fashioned peddler and repairman who traveled through Maine by wagon. That setting and that time produce great stories and minor players; it's a pleasure to read any given page.<br /><br />The bad news: Harding's metaphors are an annoyance. George repaired clocks for a living; now he's at the mercy of diseases that take him swirling chaotically through time.<br /><br />The good news: In a book this short, nothing lasts long.<br /><br />The better news: This short novel, though small, packs a considerable wallop.Asia, to Europe, to Africa, fixed clocks for thirty years, spoiled his grandkids, got Parkinson's, got diabetes, got cancer, and was laid out in a hospital bed in the middle of his living room.\\"     But look how that paragraph starts:     \\"One hundred and sixty-eight hours before he died, he sneaked into the basement window of the West Cove Methodist Church and rang the bell on Halloween night.

B001LF347E|5.0|There is just something about this show that never fails to put a smile on my face. The interactions of the characters/actors are so wonderful and they have such obvious chemistry, you can't help but adore them. Often, in a story of this genre (especially with TV shows), I would be concerned about the risk of cheese factor, melodramatic dialogue, etc. but Merlin falls victim to none of the standard problems. The writing is clever and mature, the direction and visuals lovely, the costume and set design fantastic and the performances are just superb.<br /><br />To be honest, I watched the pilot of this series expecting not to care for it. So when I ended up getting completely hooked within the first 15 minutes (from Merlin and Arthur's first meeting), it was a truly welcomed surprise. Yes, some drastic changes were made from the original legends...Merlin is actually a couple of years younger than the prince rather than old man with a long beard, and becomes his incredibly cheeky personal servant. Arthur starts out as an arrogant jackass who likes to give poor Merlin a hard time while still becoming close to him, which makes their relationship both entertaining and endearing. The future queen Gwen is thus far a servant girl to the Lady Morgana, and the romance between her and Arthur is slowly and believably developed...and so on and so forth. However, it doesn't matter that they've taken creative liberties with the story - the fact is, they've done it extremely well. It's very tastefully constructed and while a unique approach to the ancient story, manages to hold true to it in its own way.<br /><br />The one and only thing lacking in this show is the special effects when it comes to any monsters or magical creatures, which are fairly low budget and old school. However, I'm able to easily get past that aspect since everything else is so very well done and they don't overdo the monsters, so it's not too often that it's brought to your attention. Everything else feels like a high budget epic.<br /><br />As for the DVD release itself...it's a must-have if you want to be as entertained by the cast members as by the characters they play. The many commentaries, behind-the-scenes features and especially the cast diaries are not to be missed...they will make you envious that you weren't there to join in the fun. The bottom line? This box set is absolutely worth your money, so go for it.epic.

B00004KD1L|4.0|The group that gave us that great uptempo song, \\"If Everybody Looked The Same\\" for the Sly Stallone movie, \\"Get Carter\\", has delivered a breezy, bright, electronic reggae/hip-hop/pop, if you will, mixture, sometimes too \\"loop-driven\\" and repetitive, but more often engaging; drum cymbals high in the mix.<br /><br />\\"At The River\\", with a Doris Day (?) sample, is another mysterious, impressionistic work.<br /><br />\\"I See You Baby\\" is something for the urban dance floor, with lyrics capturing the mood and the humour; \\"A Private Interlude\\", continues the happy feeling, kicking off with some sound effects sounding borrowed from Frank Zappa's \\"Weasals Ripped My Flesh\\".<br /><br />Like the flugelhorn on \\"Dusk You & Me\\"; like the rest of the CD instrumentation, masterfully captured.<br /><br />The inner photo of the duo says it all - zero embellishment needed.

031237593X|5.0|I bought this book after reading some of the glowing reviews others have posted. I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical after a lifetime of hearing and reading about the villianous Richard III. This book far exceeded my expectations!! I loved every minute I spent with the characters, Richard especially. He is convincingly portrayed here as a really nice guy, with strong values and emotions. He loves his family and is not at all the sinister, duplicitous monster that he is otherwise portaryed to be. I will be the first to admit that I'm far from being an expert about Richard III, so I can't say for sure how accurate this book is to actual, historical facts. It certainly seems fairly accurate in my humble opinion, but honestly I enjoyed it so much that I really didn't care! I can't wait to read another of Ms. Penman's books!

B002ZCDR88|5.0|My 5 stars represent the various arrangements that I find fitting to the text.  It's a fairly original concept that isn't produced often.  (In fact, I'm reminded of her work with Billy Bragg & Wilco setting their music to the text of Woody Guthrie).  Natalie had 7 long years to create this and she definitely covers a lot of ground with many different genres and musical styles.  All in all, it is a successful venture for her.    I found the sequencing at first to be a bit confusing but it works in the end.  I think Medeski, Martin & Wood are underused however - not because they're only featured on one song but the style in which they're used - they could have brought sooo much more style and substance to either the song they play on (It Makes a Change) or a different song altogether.  I wasn't sold on all the orchestral pieces placed towards the end of the collection either but the more I listen, it makes sense to me - after the journey these remarkable songs bring you on - it seems to float off into the air and whither away by closing out the songs with these pieces.  Indian Names grows on me just before it fades away.  Calico Pie coupled with Adventures of Isobel are fine uptempo tunes that really evoke the lyrics.  Dancing Bear is another fine interpretation set to music.  Even if Klezmer music is not my 'thing' it certainly is for that song.  I love it.  It's a vivid telling of that story.  The Man In the Wilderness & If No One Ever Marries Me are both eerily beautiful.    Overall, Natalie's voice sounds as strong as ever.  It's playful, somber, gentle, strong and clear.  The saving grace here is that she FINALLY chose to include a producer with the great Andres Levin.  He has worked or written for B-52's, Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, Chic, David Byrne, Ce Ce Peniston and some soundstrack and score work).  After listening a few times to this collection, there is a definite cohesiveness to the tracks - Levin gives them all a warm and very gentle - not rushed - sound.  Natalie has hinted at this in some of her solo work but has never come this close to perfecting it.  Again, THANKFULLY she chose a producer for a work of this magnitude.  He really brings a beautiful objective approach to realizing these songs with her.    It will be interesting to see/hear how Natalie follows up this collection with her new work of original tunes.  Hopefully she will choose a producer to help with those as well.  They are a strong bunch of tunes and deserve proper treatment.    And to all the negative 1 star reviews - it's respectable that you choose to lay down 1 star (for any review) but at least have more than a few lines and some concrete details to back yourself up.  Sarcastic 1 liners sorta represent you rather than the item your reviewing.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I thought the 60 different releases of Lord of the Rings was enough back in the day, now it looks like Avatar is gonna go the same route, possibly worse for the following reasons.    1.  It has already been announced that there's gonna be a special extended edition.  2.  A 3-D version has also been confirmed, probably theatrical release at first.  3.  Sometime after the 3-D version comes I bet there will also be a Special Extended 3-D Edition.    All that being said, I bet Blu-Ray will be on its way out and a higher quality media(Purple-Ray or whatever it may be called) will be soon to make its debut and the cycle will go on.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I just got it today and was so excited to watch it on bluray but then when I tried playing it, the movie was very choppy. I continued playing it anyway hoping that the disc was only faulty for the first few minutes but the choppiness did not stop. So I was forced to watch it on DVD. Thank goodness it came with a DVD copy :). Anyway, Amazon is shipping me a new one and hopefully that the one they will ship is not faulty.     Back to the review. The movie is simply amazing! The storyline is superb. It saddens me to think about the future and how us could do such a thing. Hopefully that's not the case in the future.     I'm kinda glad that the Bluray disc i got was defective, it gives me one more reason to watch it again! :)
0762188618|5.0|I saw the movie first and enjoyed it but the book is much richer and very clever and the triangle between the three characters is much more understandable. If you have seen the movie don't pass up the book because it may one of the best of the genre. One the other hand the movie is worth seeing once you've read the book Indeed the contrast and comparison delineates the limits of both media. Plays are easily moved to film but not Dickens. Books will never disappear!
B002TZS5GU|2.0|Carriers takes place shortly after a horrible new virus has devastated the United States (and presumably, the rest of the world), causing the infected to rot away while still alive.  They look like zombies, but they're not, and they don't come lurching after people to eat them; their ony danger is that they're highly infectious, so you don't want to be anywhere near them.  The movie follows four friends traveling cross-country in a van looking for a safe haven.       First problem - the four characters.  I want to say that this isn't any fault of the actors, but these are four of the least sympathetic protagonists for any movie I've seen.  If it's the movie's intention to show that in this apocalyptic situation, the virus isn't the only threat, that the dark side of humanity is, they succeed, but they succeed too well.  Although there are a few likable characters here and there, their time is short-lived, as we find the four leads increasingly willing to go to any level of ruthlessness, to stoop to any low, and to turn on one another, to even marginally increase their chances for survival in an increasingly desperate situation.  It sounds like something that might have potential, that might come off as tragic, but they're just too willing to sacrifice anyone, to sacrifice their own loved ones, to sacrifice children, even when the threat to themselves is only suspected and not definate.  The movie may be trying to make some kind of statement about the state of the world, but if so, it doesn't really hit the target.  Any idea that there's a message behind this is only surmise, buried under a very nihilistic and gritty journey of four characters that one is pressed hard to care about.  And it's not just that they don't come off as 'good guys', because you can make a movie focusing on the bad guys and still have them interesting, with or without redeeming values.  It's a credit to the cast that they manage to turn in noticeably strong performances while playing characters who are neither likable nor interesting.       Good points - this movie is very well made.  The acting, production values, special effects and all that are done well.  Chris Pine in particular turns in an impressive performance.  And the idea that this is trying to ask a question about the world - say, \\"how far do we, and should we, go to protect ourselves from what may or not be a threat?\\" or even \\"from a real threat?\\"   There's potency in that, because it's a very valid question in a world where you have to weigh a lot of different factors, and would LIKE to do what's best for not just yourself but for everybody, but can't quite figure out exactly what that is.  In the example portrayed in this movie, the characters seem to end up attaching huge importance to their own chances for survival (even if it's just extending their life by one more day), a vastly smaller amount on the lives of those closest to them, and none whatsoever for the lives of strangers.  This might have been an effective characterization for 1 or 2 characters, but for ALL the main players?       So it's quite depressing.  Not sad or tragic, just depressing, there's a big difference.  And although it's clearly a horror movie, it's not scary or suspenseful either, at least not to me.  Those into ultra-gritty dramas about humanity's dark side, or very into movies that serve as cautionary tales about that dark side, might find Carriers a bit more appealing than I did.  Also, if you just want to watch something to see a fine cast do a great job with very difficult material, this isn't a bad pick.  For me personally, the nihilistic/depressing aspects just too completely overwhelm everything else.  On the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the techical aspects of the show, and if a 'cautionary tale' is what they were going for, then they to some degree succeed.  So just because I wasn't that into this one, doesn't mean others won't like it more.   Personally though - not exactly a favorite, but not the worst either.
0763637084|1.0|The pop-ups in this book are cute and creative. While the writing is kid-friendly and entertaining, it is makes a big deal about what children don't like and encourages them to refuse food on general principles. Normally, children push themselves along to learn to like the food their parents eat. Since a friend's son, who is a good eater, saw this video, he announces, \\"I will never not ever eat a tomato!\\" Reading this book, children learn that 1) their refusal to eat vegetables is a big deal and 2) to get around their refusal, people they respect will lie to them. Why does Lola list vegetable she won't eat? To get others to BACK OFF, that's why. Undoubtedly, someone is all worried about her vegetable refusal and trying to GET her to eat them. In the story, it is Charlie--probably shown by his parents that  part of feeding Lola is getting her to eat vegetables. How does Charlie do it? By lying to her. Carrots are orange twiglets from Jupiter, peas are green drops from Greenland. I could go on. So naturally, Lola eats--and likes. In your dreams! How dumb do we think she is? Like any other self-respecting child, she will see through this subterfuge in a flash! And become even more insistent about refusing to eat vegetables. Leave the kid alone! Lola will learn to eat her vegetables as long as her parents eat and enjoy them and stop making an issue about it! Here is a better theme: Parents do the what, when and where of feeding, children do the how much and whether of eating. [[ASIN:0923521518 Child of Mine: Feeding with Love and Good Sense]]

0763644455|5.0|If you're in the market for a copy of Treasure Island, this is the edition to buy. It is worth every penny and reminds me of the amazing old books with the stunning color plates that make them so sought after and valuable.     I found this while searching for classics to whet the appetite of the students in our class, many of whom are devouring the Percy Jackson series (Lightening Thief). I am happy to see how that particular series is whetting their appetite for the Greek Myths. D'Aulaires \\"Book of Greek Myths\\" is once again flying off the school library shelf as a result. But the modern language of the Percy Jackson series kept nagging me, i.e.\\"Hillary Duff's so yesterday.\\" Also, in \\"The Titan's Curse\\", Dionysus is referred to as the \\"Wine Dude\\". Dionysus threatens to put the next person who calls him that nickname into a bottle of Merlot.     Please don't misread me, I think the series is engaging and highly educational. Rick Riordon's humor is right on point. I love hearing the kids laugh aloud as they read his books. A new generation is being inspired to delve more deeply into Greek mythology because of one amazingly creative author.    I just wanted to inspire the students with a classic book on its own merit, not because they heard of the story in a hugely popular modern book. \\"Treasure Island\\" came first to mind as I began my search. It has all the bawdy and raucous action and language of \\"The Lightening Thief\\". And like Percy Jackson, Jim Hawkins' command of the English language balances out the colloquialism's of his pirate companions. When I saw this on display in a local bookstore I couldn't believe my eyes.    John Lawrence's artistic vision & gift put this book over the top. On the back cover flap Lawrence says, \\"The months I've spent in the company of Robert Louis Stevenson's characters have been exhilarating, and I hope something of my excitement comes across in these illustrations.\\" I can say without reservation that that is exactly what he accomplished. The illustrations are exhilarating and compelling. In some way I would say they do more justice to the story than any film rendition.    So far this book has passed the test. My Percy Jackson readers can't wait to get their hands on this book during free time. I'm thinking of purchasing a second copy to keep up with demand.    I can't recommend this book highly enough. I hope more readers young and old rediscover Treasure Island because of John Lawrence's new and refreshing visual take on a wonderful old classic.    Highly recommended to all bibliophiles!!!
B002VPE1AW|3.0|Unfortunately, that's the only good thing about this movie.  If you have a TV big enough to appreciate the visuals, it's worth watching.  The plot line, however, is so predictable it made my teeth ache, and in places, so silly all I could do was groan (for example, the cavalry charge, duh).  The real pity is that they had the basics for a si-fi movie that would have eclipsed everything that came before - a sentient planet connected to all the life, both animal and human, on it; a trained marine and a combat pilot who should have had an understanding of basic tactics; and a group of highly trained, motivated scientists. They couldn't get any of the excellent si-fi (or even combat movie) writers out there??

But coming from metal hit makers, this album is not as strong as Scream Aim Fire, nor The Poison. Having one or two strong heavy songs, this album tunes down from their previous ones. More singing, less screaming. I've been listening it all week. I like a couple of songs, as I'm not a \\"hardcore only\\" listener, I can enjoy it from first song to last. From all their albums, this is the least favorite. 3 songs sound like \\"Hearts Burst Into Fire\\" from S.A.F.  I love Bullet, therefore I like this album, but I wanted to love it... It can hold, until the next record comes, hopefully more like their roots.

B0002V7OI8|3.0|Whereas Armageddon focused more on action and comedy, Deep Impact's main concern was drama. This film was released two months before Armageddon, and was more well-received by critics. The audience, however, preferred Armageddon a bit more, which resulted in its higher box-office performance. Deep Impact didn't rely too much on special effects or Hollywood-style action, but it did concentrate on the human elements of the story. The plot is thicker, and the drama is more compelling. But sometimes it can be too compelling, as some scenes look like they come from a daytime soap opera. A few dialogue moments are as silly as the ones found in Armageddon, but at least they are written more carefully.<br /><br />Like I said, the special effects aren't very important in Deep Impact. They are, however, pretty spectacular. The Wolf-Biederman comet looks good, and scenes involving outer space in general look beautiful. The giant tsunami scene near the end of the film can be really intensely riveting as we see the devastating destruction right in front of our eyes.<br /><br />The performances are good, the special effects are impressive, and the drama is fairly convincing. So why am I giving this the same grade as with Armageddon? Well, beside some silly dialogue moments, I did find a few pretensions in the drama. There weren't much, but some can be very obvious. Plus, I did find Elijah Wood and Tea Leoni to be a bit unmoving. Their performance didn't affect me very much, and I personally found them to be uncomfortable to look at sometimes. And finally, some scenes in the movie did tend to drag. It's two hours long, but it does feel like an extra thirty minutes had been added in.<br /><br />In the end, both Deep Impact AND Armageddon aren't great films. Armageddon is an overproduced action film with some filler action scenes, second-rate dialogue, and an unnecessary romance between Ben Affleck & Live Tyler. Deep Impact, on the other hand, is a fairly pretentious human drama with some mediocre performances, some silly dialogue, and several slow-moving scenes. Both films aren't very good, but they're certainly not bad, either. Both have great special effects, good action, and good drama. Still, I give both of these films a C. They're pretty much adequate, but they're still very watchable.<br /><br />Grade: C<br /><br />Part 1 of this review can be found here: [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]]ces, some silly dialogue, and several slow-moving scenes.

B002SJIO54|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. The special effects were very well done, and actually supported the story and characters rather than eclipsing them (bad), or taking the place of them (worse). I rented this to watch, and am now buying it. It's worth owning, and worth watching more than once. The main character was wonderfully written and acted. I liked his complexity. He was a not-terribly-bright jerk, and continued to be a jerk, but was also able to grow. He genuinely loved his wife and she him, which is very sweet, and isn't portrayed in the movies very often.  All in all, a very elegant, thoughtful and entertaining movie. Can't wait to watch it again! I hope this team of writer/director comes out with more stuff, and doesn't allow themselves to get swept into tedious-explosions-with-no-story-or-characters Hollywood land.
0307271862|4.0|After reading the Larsson trilogy featuring the wonderfully flawed heroine Lisabeth Salander it was quite easy to reread several of the Wallander books by Henning Mankell. The Man From Beijing is not a Wallander book but is a true thriller in that the horrific crime committed at the start is made very believable by the power of revenge even over a century. The heroine is an overweight, 60 year-old with high blood pressure Judge who is persistent despite her strange home life. Trying to reason who would want to decimate a swedish village is the main theme of the book but there are well researched side travels into the building of railways in America and travels in gthe hectic city life of Beijing. There are some wonderful mental scenes in this especially of Africa. Henning Mankell again shows why he is the top Swedish author, still alive. Long may he reign.
B0017XCDN6|4.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS    Caitlin Swinford  4-6th-2010 T    \\"Because it is right\\":  Honor in Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima       Japanese culture values honor greatly.  Honor represents the skeleton to the rest of the body, the foundation to the rest of the house.  However, defining honor can pose a difficulty.  Does it involve dying for one's country?  Or does thinking for one's self suffice?  Perhaps the key consists of obeying superior officers?  Honor breaks down into five levels:  honor for self, honor for family, honor for clan, honor for nation, and honor for humanity.  Deciding which takes precedence over the other proves challenging.  Clint Eastwood addresses the questions on honor directly in his film Letters from Iwo Jima.  One can tell immediately what he believes constitutes honor.  Eastwood presents both a common soldier named Saigo and General Kuribayashi as honorable men.  On the other hand, Captain Tashida and most other officers seem dishonorable, though they claim to act for the honor of their country.  In Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood portrays honor to humanity as the most important kind of honor.      Letters from Iwo Jima shows World War II from the point of view of the Japanese.  Japanese culture promotes honor for one's self, one's family, and one's country.  Because Letters from Iwo Jima focuses on war and defending one's country, the characters would logically concentrate on honor to country rather than honor to family or clan.  However, this view point makes honor to humanity take a back seat.  According to a New York Times article by Ian Buruma, most war films \\"lack visible enemies.  [...] What is missing, with rare exceptions, is any sense of individual difference, of character, of humanity in the enemy\\" (par. 1).  However, unlike some war movies, Letters from Iwo Jima portrays both the Japanese and the Americans participating in honorable and dishonorable acts.  It shows that race does not matter because all are human.  It shows that certain beliefs are universal.  Honor may vary from place to place, but honor exists everywhere.  It is what is right.  In Letters from Iwo Jima, Clint Eastwood shows the audience that what is right does not differ much between Japan and America.  Honor is about humanity.   Japanese culture emphasizes obeying and sacrificing for one's family and one's country.  The idea of feeling honored to die for one's country repeats throughout the film.  General Kuribayashi writes to his family saying he is \\"determined to serve and die\\" for Japan (Letters from Iwo Jima).  However, he disapproves of killing soldiers who retreat.  In fact, he orders the retreat.  Many officers see this as weakness and a disgrace to the emperor; they would rather that the soldiers die honorable deaths by American slaughter or by suicide.  Either of these deaths would align with the ideas of self honor and honor to country.  In one particular scene, Saigo and another soldier have retreated to the northern caves.  The rest of the company had committed suicide instead of following General Kuribayashi's orders.  A lieutenant discovers Saigo and Shizumi and attempts to kill them for retreating, which he sees as dishonorable because he equates this act with cowardice.  General Kuribayashi prevents the lieutenant from killing the two soldiers \\"needlessly\\" (Letters from Iwo Jima).  Kuribayashi's actions demonstrate honor for humanity rather than for country.  He also strives to prevent suicides, further emphasizing honor to humanity by forbidding a cultural tradition for the sake of lives.  Baruma writes, \\"Although he was quite aware of the ultimate fate of his army, he saw no merit in wanton self-destruction\\" (par. 19).  He would rather have someone die for their country than for personal honor.   Letters from Iwo Jima demonstrates some of the dishonorable actions that the Japanese performed.  One scene depicts several Japanese soldiers brutally beating and stabbing an American soldier to death.  Thebrutality of the American's death goes against the idea of honor to humanity.  In war, people will be killed.  However, these soldiers go beyond protecting themselves and their comrades; they murder.  In another scene, an officer attempts to kill Saigo and another soldier because they retreated.  Both these instances shock viewers and cause them to think about what constitutes right and honor.  These scenes depict the Doctrine of Double Effect, a principle that explains whether or not violence is alright if it occurs \\"as a side effect of promoting some good end\\" (McIntyre, par. 1).  Eastwood uses these scenes to lead the viewers to believe that, even in wartime, a line exists between defense and murder.  The viewer senses that the Japanese soldiers and the officer do not follow the doctrine, which promotes humanity.     Unlike most war movies, Letters from Iwo Jima depicts an enemy as moral as the protagonists, capable of good and bad.  \\"Most war movies have been about heroes, our heroes, and individual differences among the enemies were irrelevant, since their villainy could be taken for granted\\" (Buruma, par. 4).  A scene on par with Buruma's idea of an enemy's villainy occurs when an American soldier shoots two Japanese prisoners because he does not want to guard them for an entire night.  One would think that the director would show only Japanese doing right and only Americans doing wrong because of the film's Japanese perspective.  This is not the case.  Most movies do not show \\"recognizable human qualities\\" because it would \\"inject the murderousness of our heroes with a moral ambiguity that we would not wish to see\\" (par. 4); but Letters from Iwo Jima shows Americans with good qualities.  For instance, American marines give water to Japanese prisoners.  Later, an American lieutenant orders his men not to shoot Saigo, though he frantically attacks them with a shovel.  In the last scene of the film, the Americans place Saigo in a line of wounded American soldiers awaiting treatment.  These scenes demonstrate the honor of the enemy in the film in which the enemy respects humanity.    Both countries hold similar views.  While Americans are often absent in the film, the viewer still sees that both sides have similar views.  Lieutenant Colonel Nishi treats a wounded American soldier to no avail; after the soldier's death, Nishi finds a letter from the soldier's mother.  He reads it aloud to his squad; the expressions of the soldiers tell that they had not thought of the Americans as people before the letter.  One phrase in particular resonates with the soldiers:  \\"Always do what's right because it is right,\\" (Letters from Iwo Jima).  Nishi uses this in his motivational speech to the soldiers, proving that he believes the same as his enemy's mother.  Later Shizumi tells Saigo that, before meeting the American soldier and hearing the letter, he had thought of the Americans as \\"cowards\\" and \\"savages,\\" and he admits to his ignorance concerning the Americans (Letters from Iwo Jima).  He says, \\"That American soldier.  His mother's words were the same as my mother's\\" (Letters from Iwo Jima).  This phrase strikes the hearts of viewers and Japanese soldiers as something true and honorable.  Through this realization, Eastwood demonstrates that the two countries have similar views and that humanity trumps enmity between people.     Letters from Iwo Jima exhibits that, no matter which side of the war, everyone can commit honorable and dishonorable acts.  We are human before we belong to a certain race or country.  While the \\"right thing\\" to do may prove difficult to decide, the importance lies in righteousness (Letters from Iwo Jima).  Clint Eastwood demonstrates honor for humanity by showing both the Japanese and their enemies doing good.  He shows that honor lies in treating enemy wounds and in giving them water.  He defines honor as serving one's country, as well as surviving in order to serve.  Honor is fairness, integrity and, mostof all, respecting humanity.  One achieves honor for one's self and one's country by displaying honor for humanity.              Works Cited      Buruma, Ian. \\"Eastwood's War.\\" New York Times. 54.2 (2007): Web.

0316067601|4.0|Just finished this one up.  It's an impressive story made even more interesting by the frank truthfullness and harsh reality throughout.  Mr. Luttrell's writing is easy to read with most military terminology, ideas, and ideals well explained.  I have a great respect for the things Mr. Luttrell has done and the homage he has written to those have sacrificied for all of us.    That being said Mr. Luttrell's \\"holier then thou\\" attitude annoys the living crap out of me.  I know that Mr. Luttrell has gone through hell and back and have no desire to ever follow in his footsteps, but humility is severely lacking in several places.  I almost gave up on him several times over the first 3-5 chapters due to this, but thankfully stuck with it and remain impressed by the remainder of the story.

B002T9H2ME|4.0|Going into \\"Moon,\\" I had a preconceived idea of what was going to happen based on the first five minutes.  I thought this would be another paint-by-numbers predictable SF movie, another \\"Carnival of Souls\\" in space.  Instead, \\"Moon\\" delivers an original movie, with a bit of \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" and even \\"Outland\\" thrown in the mix.<br /><br />What really makes the movie is the actors.  In a film where we're stuck in a moonbase with two characters for an hour and forty minutes, the actors had better be good and had better be well-written.  The script, and Rockwell and Spacey, deliver.  The \\"two-man show\\" is one of the most difficult bits of drama to pull off, and they manage to do it very well.  In another refreshing turn, the ending is happier and more optimistic than I had expected.  I don't need a happy ending every time, but I also don't need every movie to have a downer 70s German film style ending either.  While this is not a hugely effects-driven movie, most of the effects look great, as if they were part of a much higher-budget movie.  My one geek quibble is that, the entire movie, everything takes place at Earth gravity, which is fine.  To do otherwise would have cost 20 times the money.  But at the very end, all of a sudden there is some lunar gravity reflected in how a person moves around the lunar surface in a spacesuit.  That's no reason to not watch the movie, but it's jarring enough to take you out of the suspension of disbelief and make you think about the gravity and not the movie.<br /><br />The pacing of \\"Moon\\" is deliberate, perhaps too much so.  I would have cut 10 minutes or so out in order to get this down to the magic 90 minute mark.  However, \\"Moon\\" doesn't go on overly long or wear out its welcome.<br /><br />SF lovers, and probably the population at large, will enjoy at least renting \\"Moon.\\"

I will freely admit that I am generally not an enormous fan of hard science, and was a bit hesitant when I was first faced with it.  I'm a history major, and I chose the topic for my Marine Biology term paper based on the fact that Sea Otters are really cute. That's why I was quite surprised when I found this book fascinating.  Its blend of valuable scientific information, humor, and history makes it eminently readable.  The photography is beautiful and varied, and the layout is incredibly well configured.<br />Elements is accessible enough for my 10 year old student to enjoy it thoroughly, but deep enough that I have to fight the urge to read it in session.

Now having the chance to buy all her books, I'm just fascinated. Whenever I open A PHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE: 1990-2005 book, it's like riding through someone else's deep life with a given avatar...

B00004TL2N|5.0|This has long been one of my favorite recordings of the 8th. There is just something very special about Boulez's approach. The details are as clear as one could want, while still allowing one to bask in the sheer beauty and glow of the resonant cathedral acoustics. Boulez has a tremendous gift for highlighting the structure of the symphony, obviously drawing parallels to the organ-like terracing that Bruckner often achieved in his compositions.   Another reason this recording stands out is because it is so direct, yet still conveys a tremendous amount of warmth and humanity. The first movement has wonderful flow and intensity, even if the climax isn't quite as overpowering as with Karajan or Wand. The Scherzo has a real galloping quality thanks to the brisk pace, and even the slightly faster than normal pace for the Adagio does not detract from the depth and intensity. The climax of the Adagio is overwhelming and the final bars are incredibly serene, with the string basses resonating grandly and the horns floating above the din as if they were coming down from Heaven itself. The final movement is handled superbly as well, while the finale is the best I've ever heard with a tremendous build up and final release, with every detail coming through well.  The fact that this amazing performance captures the entire version without any cuts, all on a single CD, makes for a very convenient way to hear all of Bruckner's wonderful music without having to pay $30 or switch CD's half-way through the symphony. Like with any work or composer, however, it is all about opinions and preferences, and one's best can be another's worst. With a work such as this, there is room for many interpretations as there are so many wonderful conductors with something to contribute. To my ears, this is easily on par with the popular recordings from Karajan, Wand and others.excellent, the first recording I ever heard of this symphony), however I prefer these newer accounts as Karajan can just be a bit too expansive sometimes, which to me simply seems indulgent rather than \\"deeper\\" or \\"more spiritual.\\" Still, for Karajan fans (me included) they would be satisfied with those accounts as well, but for this particular symphony my ears prefer Boulez and Wand. Like with any work or composer, however, it is all about opinions and preferences, and one's best can be another's worst. With a work such as this, there is room for many interpretations as there are so many wonderful conductors with something to contribute.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|In this time we are living in, remakes are coming in theaters literally every 5 seconds. Texas Chainsaw massacre,the karate kid, batman, and so on. But what makes this movie different from other crappy movie remakes? Why remake Neon Genesis Evangelion when it's already perfect the way it is (ignore eps. 25-26). To be honest, I can't give a good reason why I love this remake movie of the franchise but I can easily say that it is DAMN IMPRESSIVE! Probably the best 30 bucks I spent on a blue ray disk. ALMOST everything is PERFECT about this new version of Eva. The art is perfect, that voice acting is perfect, the plot, even the music kicks ass. Basically this and the other 3 movies coming out is a remake of the whole tv series (and supposedly a remake ending of The End of Evangelion film as well) but without all the plot fillers in it. I highly recomend it to anyone but I Will have to warn you to watch the original tv series before watching this movie. And for good reasons    SPOILER ALERTS!!!!!!!!!!!!    1. Many symbols are changed in nerv. Instead of a leaf it's an apple. Probably a symbol for \\"adam's\\" apple. And you don't see Nerv's higher command face to face like in the show at the begining. They start off with the weird obilisks things.    2. Misato is very aware of lilith's location at Nerv HQ. She even shows it to Shinji.    3. Kawrou makes an appearance at the end, and I'm guessing there is a space station on the moon with supposedly another Lillith creature.    4. At the ending credits, Mari the newest Evangelion character ever made is briefly shown. Making her first appearance in Eva 2.0 movie.    I love this movie. I can talk about this thing for hours on end. If you love Eva, THEN BUY IT! NO REGRETS!!!!!!!
0792843584|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out.  It was panned by the critics.  I wondered if they had seen the same film I saw.  The roller skating scene and the music throughout the whole film were mezmerizing.
B000V659OU|5.0|What can I say? Critics loved it and so do I. It takes you from the fantasies of childhood to the reality of adulthood. The acting is great and the characters just make you think of youthful times when life seemed so magical.  How it all ties together make it a wonderful movie to see from time to time.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|it's a very good series.so,I'm going to review the set itself.a couple of the discs skip or freeze,they didn't seem to be dirty,could of been my player.the set comes with the movie \\"razor\\",so you don't have to buy it separately(yes ,I bought the movie when I bought the set).Here's my main gripe,season 4 starts with \\"Razor\\",then disc 2,3,4.there's no disc 1... disc 2 starts with \\"previously on battlestar galactica\\" there's couple of scenes from episodes I've never seen,and that first episode on disc 2 seems to jump forward a lot.So I really believe they left out disc 1.Someone that knows the series better than me will probably correct me on that,and that okay 'cause I'd like to know.All in all,it's a really good series
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've seen this premise before: the government pitting children (or adults) against each other in a game of death with the ultimate prize being survival. I've always been somewhat turned off from such stories, but after hearing such good things about this book, I had to read it. I'm very glad I did. This is an extremely well written story that hit me emotionally as well.<br /><br />Katniss lives a dystopian North America which has been divided into districts. Life is tough. Very tough. In order to survive, Katniss has learned survival skills and sneaks out, beyond the boundaries of District 12, to hunt and forage. Each year the children of the districts are entered into a lottery. A boy and a girl will be sent to the rich and hedonistic Capital to compete for their lives in The Hunger Games. When Katniss' sister is chosen, she volunteers to go instead. She is accompanied by her fellow District 12 competitor, Peta. The odds are very much against her.<br /><br />This book is an emotional whirlwind in a well developed world. From the first page, Katniss is described in a way that elicits the utmost sympathy, though I didn't quite connect with her personally. She's a smart, very \\"black and white\\" character who can't always see the subtleties. She can scheme with the best of her competitors, but can't imagine that anyone would have any truly altruistic goals to help her. This can be a little frustrating, but it's the only part of the book I didn't \\"get.\\" Of course, this book is about killing to survive, so there's a good amount of violence in the book, though it's not gory. I'd recommend it for teens to adults.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|Bought as a gift for someone who likes Taylor Swift.  They like the CD but it's just so-so.  She said she probably wouldn't give it as a gift to someone else.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Entertaining, with some great effects, and some solid acting and real heart.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that, as the film went on the action took over to the point<br />where the emotions got a bit lost, and the climactic battle felt a bit predictable.<br /><br />The action is fun, but it gets repetitive, while the human scenes retain their humor<br />and freshness.<br /><br />What always made Star Trek special for me was it's emphasis on characters and<br />intelligence first, action second.  So I was sorry that ended up a bit reversed by the<br />end here.<br /><br />But if it's not quite a great movie, it's certainly an enjoyable and well-made one.
B002VECM4K|5.0|This is such a powerful movie that I think every person who works directly with children should see and discuss it.  Having read the book first really helped in understanding what Precious had gone through as a child when no one would listen to or \\"notice\\" her.
B001B51B9M|4.0|GOOD movie as always, but this Blu-ray transfer is disappointing. The movie definitely deserves to have a first rate remastering, but it apparently did not get any remastering whatsoever!  The colors are far from saturated and on many scenes, there is a slight milky haze over the entire frame. In brief, the Blu-ray version could be a waste of money. It is probably largely a waste of a high definition audio and video format.
0767802470|5.0|Most of the people reading this review are intelligent enough to know that in any war or any conflict in the history of mankind, no side was completely right or completely wrong. That being said, what I liked most about this film was that it was not \\"Hollywoodized\\". It gave a very realistic, straightforward story about a German U-boat crew and its experiences while carrying out their mission to sink Allied ships bringing supplies to Great Britain.    After dodging destroyers and depth charges, enduring stormy seas, surviving being crippled on the bottom of the Mediterranean; they end up being strafed by Allied aircraft right in the theoretical safety of La Rochelle harbor. Most of the crew are killed including the captain - who's last sight was to see his U-boat sink in the harbor.    All in all, a very entertaining war movie from an alternative perspective.

B0001I562I|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's \\"Flight of the Navigator\\" gladly wallows in its time period, even being set partly in the year it came out:  1986.  It has a Henry Thomas look-alike(for the time period) in star Joey Cramer.  It features Sarah Jessica Parker with a bad 'eighties era punk band hairdo.  Despite all of this, I like it a lot.<br /><br />It concerns David Freeman, a young boy who falls down a ravine in the year 1978 and wakes up eight years later in 1986.  Much of the fun and poignancy of the movie comes from David's reactions to the changes around him.  For instance, in 1978 David had a younger brother but in 1986 his younger brother becomes his older brother because David has not aged at all after having been mysteriously gone for eight years.  The creative team behind this movie achieves genuine suspense as David discovers what had been his home in 1978 is inhabited by an unknown older couple in 1986.  The secret of where David's been for his missing eight years drives the movie, first at a research facility and then on an entertaining spaceship ride.<br /><br />Also starring Howard Hesseman and featuring the voice of Paul Reubens working under the name Paul Mall, The Walt Disney Company's \\"Flight of the Navigator\\" remains entertaining fun.
B002IVLH60|5.0|Got this for my husband (Pearl Jam is his favorite band) for a gift- and we both love it. Great album
B002KDUDG6|5.0|What can you not say about Michael Buble'!  His voice can be as soft as velvet or he can belt out a dance tune that drives you to dance!  He is amazing and for anyone who has not yet attended a live performance...get to one!  You will never forget his performance.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I LOVED this movie and would highly recommend it for family movie night! In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I'm considering buying the DVD, which is something I rarely do. I'm certain it'd be worth every penny because I'd watch it over and over again.  This, to me, has the makings of a classic and I was pleasantly surprised to see Richard Gere play the lead.  You'll laugh some; you'll cry some; and then you'll laugh some more. After watching this, I fell asleep with a smile on my face and in my heart.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Watching this movie is like trying to enjoy a film about spousal abuse starring OJ Simpson.     James Francis Cameron (film's creator) has publicly stated that \\"we\\" need to do something about the environment on earth. No kidding.  Only...the \\"we\\" part of that statement excludes Cameron. This self appointed expert on environmental matters clearly believes that the resources required to make, release, and view one of his films saves countless square miles of the rainforest by some unknown phenomenon yet to be fully understood by science.  Cameron also stated that concerns such as joblessness rates always put environmental issues on the back burner.  So, did the folks that were hired to produce this movie and the plethora of others James Francis Cameron produced not get paid? And, did they otherwise live their lives with a zero impact on the environment?  Does Cameron??  How exactly does Cameron and those he employs feel about environmentally friendly nuclear power - or is oil a much better and environmentally friendly alternative in these expert nuclear physicist opinions? Or, is science not something filmmakers think they need to be familiar with to be experts on everything?  Blah... I think I will stick w Japanese anime for now on...just to avoid \\"Hollywood pompous expert opinion\\" from interfering with my movie viewing experience in the future.  Cameron also stated that people like Glen Beck are to blame for public apathy over global warming and excessive use of resources.  Huh?  To be fair, Cameron identified Beck as responsible for all human excesses and apathy toward the environment only after being repeatedly prompted to do so by MSNBC's Chris Mathews.  Oddly, he didn't say who was responsible before Beck arrived on the scene. I do give credit to Cameron for not agreeing that the  US of A has caused and continues to causes any and all environmental damage.  Perhaps he is an expert.  I feel very strongly that the environment should come first, and that one of thereasons the environment is not the primary focus of our 21st century civilization is because former truck drivers gone film makers are heralded as \\"experts\\" on the environment.     I do not go to movie theaters, by the way, because it is not environmentally friendly to do so.  Cameron doesn't care about this fact because his tens of millions would be adversely affected if people did not go to theaters.  So, it is not he that should be doing \\"something\\" ..it is the rest of us peons that should be doing something!!!    If I had heard Cameron espouse his environmental expertise prior to ordering this movie...I would not have ordered it.
0792163710|5.0|SHANE to me is the finest Western ever made. Alan Ladd's performance in the title role should have brought him the OSCAR for Best Actor. Why he was not even nominated is beyond my comprehension. The storyline is familiar with the good guys winning out over the bad guys but beyond that here are characters who really grab your attention and the supporting actors,Van Heflin,Jean Arthur,Brandon DeWilde and Jack Palance perform their roles with dedication that you don't always see in other movies. The filming of SHANE in the Grand Tetons make for terrific scenery and color. If you don't have this movie get it. Your video collection won't be complete until you do.
B001NLKT60|3.0|I thought this book was a decent read, but not nearly as compelling as the second half of Dragon.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this book is (like it's predecessor) there are so many characters that you have to try to keep straight.  That and many of the central characters had names similar enough to be confusing at times.  This book tends to focus on the characters (particularly Salander) more than the actual mystery, so I didn't find it the page turner that Dragon was.  The mystery itself was solved fairly early on, and a good portion of the book was putting those last little puzzle pieces in place.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy the book, but I'm not as excited about Hornet's Nest as I was to pick up this book after Dragon.
B001BMXFX0|4.0|In the novel The Lovely Bones written by Alice Sebold, the main character by the name of Susie Salmon is brutally murdered by her neighbor. As she watches over the lives of her family, friends, and murderer from the heavens above, Susie refuses to move on, watching them for years and years. The intricate, woven storyline describes the pain and suffering felt by the Salmon family and how grief takes over those who knew her. Because Sebold writes this story from Susie's point of view, the reader experiences the emotions felt by the victim as she watches the lives below. Through the elaborate details that Sebold writes, The Lovely Bones is a novel that depicts the newfound strength and appreciation for life one finds after dealing with death.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Watched this last night April 26,  And under $10 for blu ray.  My only complaint is the sound, more then a few times I had trouble hearing what the actor was saying.  I don't want to put any spoilers in this review because the movie is an average video, but I plan to watch it again in a month or two.  I like sci-fi and this is worth buying in blu ray, @under $10.  Good monsters, decent acting, no Oscars, a few to many plot twists, looking forward to watching it again.  Rated R for violence and some monster nudity foam rubber style.  Scary and not recommended for children under 13 (nightmare scary).
0439023491|5.0|Great book...and sequel to The Hungar Games book! Just as great as the 1st book if not better....hope a 3rd in the series comes out!!! Loved it!!
B002KGKH5A|3.0|For a music video or concert video, this DVD seems quite disarranged.  For a behind the scenes, roadie type of look at things, this seems almost perfect.  If you want to see traveling in cars to gigs, one note shows, and eating caribu with village elders, then this DVD is for you.  Strangely enough, I don't feel any closer to the band, or have a deeper understanding of \\"The White Stripes\\" after watching this.  It might be interesting enough to watch once on Netfl_x, but if your interested in something for your home library I would recommend, \\"It Might Get Loud.\\"
B0015DROBO|4.0|The first third of the book was slow.  I kept waiting for something to happen, and was confused by the numerous characters and how they fit in with the story.  It seemed like there were a couple totally unrelated story lines going on and I wasn't really sure how things would fall into place.<br /><br />However, once I got to the point I really started to enjoy the book.  The different story lines started to converge, I was able to pick out the important characters, and I was interested in how things would turn out.  There were also enough twists to prevent the book from being predictable.  While I don't think this book is is some literary masterpiece, I found it to be worth the read and look forward to finishing the series.
0307276902|3.0|Also another one of my favorite novels--this one pissed Oprah off due to the fact that the author lied/exaggerated some parts in the book even though it's classified as a auto-biography. I thought it was very intriguing even written by any mind, but that's my opinion and the amount of authentication in a autobiography is a on-going debate.       Survive From Addiction A sharp shriek of pain throttles deep in the tunnel of the earlobe.  The pain is not far from the brain. Soon, the soft, sensitive muscle is irritated by the long eerie noise from the ear. In effect, quickly distorts the senses and develops anger and hate. James Frey's rage grew on his depression and therefore became an alcoholic at the age of ten. Later, he found his life empty and alone which led him to smoke crack. Not too long he was on the line of being dead at the age of twenty-three, and then James was forced to go to rehab. Unlike most addicts, he survived at the terrible state he was in. The biography James Frey wrote consists of inspiring moments to uplift fallen victims or people who are going through tough times. Therefore, A Million Little Pieces serves lessons worth remembering to contribute a better future society.  The life of James Frey carries values to future civilizations because the future can reconcile or prevent Frey's mistakes. He became obsessed with drinking to escape from his rage and smoking crack to \\"fill\\" his empty life. Many lives can be referenced around the world or at least the state of depression and stress. Competition in education, jobs and living in luxury have increased. In the near future, competitions will increase even more between people and indeed, stress will follow. People with stressful jobs can wash it away with alcohol or even with tobacco. The age requirement for the use of alcohol and drugs has been raised in the years, but the addiction and abuse is still increasing fairly high. Frey, for example has used alcohol for almost everything, from being angry to waste time. His depression of addiction and unable to have an active life stressed his family and friends. He was unable to keep a girlfriend, his job, and later his own body. He was sick all the time from the after effects of alcohol, throwing up twice a day. That is where many people are heading in the future: nowhere. Thirteen million in the U.S. alone are suffering from alcohol abuse and most of suicides and car deaths are caused by alcohol. However, Frey became a strong individual who pulled himself together physically and mentally. His story reveals his actions and thoughts that made him successful. Even if a person cannot refer their life to Frey's, they can take inspiration of his achievement and put that working ethics to their life. Frey's life story can teach many people of the effects of alcohol and drugs, which could prevent disastrous addictions. His story can also be used to inspire future generations of strong willingness and dedications when times are though. Awareness, prevention and being strong will create a better environment for the future as well as family and friends.  A Million Little Pieces serves lessons worth remembering to contribute a better society because the story shows the values of relative and friends. Therefore, to improve society, people must first be able to improve relations between families and friends. In the past, many people had family picnics, camping and vacations. Now, most kids do not want to go outdoors and spend family time because of video games and other technology activities. Many incredible inventions like the computer, and game consoles are disturbing the time together with families and actual friends. One of the lessons Frey learned was that he could not have made it without his family and friends. He realized how embarrassing he was to his parents, but they stood by him heartbroken. Also, his brother visited James to comfort him in rehab. In addition, his friends who went through similar struggles, guidedhim to his impossible goal of being sober. Many times when Frey wanted to chug alcohol or smoke pounds of crack, his friends refrained him from doing so. Leonard, Frey's friend, who also happens to be the mob king of the west, did all he could, even by threatening him to stay sober. This shows how important family and friends relationships are to the future, especially with the fast growing technology. Many people take relationships as granted, because it's there all the time in a cycle. However, the story of James Frey reminds someone of the importance and can also help develop a well bond. James had a rage towards his parents at the beginning of the story that clashed together to show each other's differences. Later, Frey who was rugged and strong broke down to his parents and apologized. He realized the quality of life with them and understood the importance. Therefore, his experiences will enhance other relations to improve the quality of their life.  In the end, the experiences of James Frey are one of the disastrous, yet the most successful life stories in history. His self-conflicts and falls are shown to caution others to be able to control alcohol and not let drugs in the way. If fallen, the book shows great uplifting stories that explain the true value of family and friends that can help them up. A Million Little Pieces explains life lessons and family values that can build a beneficial society.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Watching on a Sony Bravia, this edition is staggering. Just gorgeous. A great many negative reviews (pre-release!) have been written about this version, mainly due to lack of extras, but for someone who wants to see the film now, again, as many times as possible, this is an absolute must-have.    I realize the studios will release this in as many editions as possible, but I'm more than content with this one. Let's face it, 3-D television technology has a loooong way to go. Buy this Blu-Ray and enjoy it, thoroughly, in the meantime.
0439023483|5.0|This book is wonderful! A rivoting Sci-fi fiction...not just for young adults for older readers too! Very interesting !!!!
B00383ZTXO|1.0|sorry for most of the listeners of this thread: I listened back to the 97 remix by Iggy and this  97 mix represents really the optimal way I want to listen to this classical....much more powerfull and the sound is more rich.Also some of the tracks in the 97 mix were uncut (last seconds no more tuned down, for example \\"your pretty face is going to hell\\" which I appreciate very much) ...this issue is for me only trying to capitalize on established values.... it is again the original material , more or less remastered with so much respect  that the difference becomes subliminal,(if you see what I mean) and the live tracks have been available elseewhere a long time ago...avoid this unless you get it for free.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I couldn't help but scan the bad reviews...  You know what the majority of them are?  Bad reviews on the edition, not the movie.  In fact these very same reviews will probably carry over to the other editions coming out thus needlessly lowering the ranking for an absolutely fabulous movie.    Having watched it in 3D I was floored and loved the movie.  A left the theater feeling that I had just watched one of the best movies of my life so far, and that is not easy to do.  The special effects were amazing (despite what some haters out there are saying that the graphics are cheesy.  C'mon, hate the storyline, but you can in no way say that the graphics are cheesy!) and I enjoyed the storyline and plot, the combination of action, drama, love sci fi and so on.  Everything nowadays has been done in one way, shape or form, so it matters in how it is delivered that will make something stand out.  And stand out Avatar does and then some.    While I thought the theater version was absolutely fantastic, I couldn't help but enjoy watching on my 52 inch HD TV in Blu Ray, enjoying the colors and graphics even more in depth than if I were at the theater.  If you can hold off and don't mind spending the extra money than wait for the special editions coming out (which I agree is pretty lame, why not release the extras with this release if not to make more money later on?  I was a little let down when I went for the extras and there weren't any).  But if you're like me and you wanted to watch it now and you don't want to spend the extra money than run out and get this Blu Ray.  I was just as floored my second time around at home as I was the first time around in 3D at the theaters.  A definite recommend.    5 stars.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I never saw this movie in the theatre, because I was warned how sad it was. They were right. Despite how beautiful the movie is, and it is with striking colours and awe inspiring visuals... the story is so, so sad. I am part Nakota and part white... a Wasican... a mixed breed. And this story is so reminiscent of all sides of my ancestry, it was truly painful for me to sit through. I had to stop watching 3 times to stop crying, before continuing. - The bottom line, I think, is that despite technological advances over the years, the people (on both sides) opted to resort to solving their differences by going to war. And I feel people of the Earth are very much the same. I am repelled by that side of humanity. I would prefer to hope mankind will choose intellect, over the use of force. - But, judging by the popularity of this film, I am deeply concerned that mankind just doesn't have what it takes. All you people seem to want is war. -  Is it any wonder God has abandoned us?
1401307450|5.0|Louis Fischetti  Mr. Halaw  Academic English IV  Independent Reading  Scar Tissue    As a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and them being my favorite band, i thought this would be a great book to read. Once i began reading the book i couldn't put it down. Every other page something more exciting and enjoyable was happening. It's interesting to know how the band got started and what the band went through as a group and as individuals. Anthony explains his childhood and his days of becoming a man as he fights his drug addictions, sexual obsessions, and pursues his dream to be a rockstar.    In this memoir, it's cool how they explain events that happened early in their lives and how it's reflected upon their music and their lifestyle. Meanings of lyrics are explained and and secrets and unknown events are revealed. Alot of things that happened early in the red hot chili peppers journey connects to who they are today. All of this is explained in the novel and it makes you say... \\"oh! so that's why they do that\\", or \\"so that's where that came from\\".    Anthony uses things such as pictures and lyrics from songs to enhance the reading and the readers views on the events that he is explaining. As a reader it's very easy to develop an image of what's going on as your reading the memior. Sometimes i almost feel as if i'm there watching whats going on. Overall i thought the book was very satisfying. At times the story gets a little repetitive and meaningless events get dragged out but the compelling events and detailed scenarios make up for it. In my opinion, the definition of a good book is one that the reader cant put it down, and Scar Tissue is definately one of those books.
160094048X|5.0|the cookies will keep you coming back for more! as a tester, i had the pleasure of whipping up batches to share with friends and colleaugues. not once did they ever suspect that they were vegan. there's a wide range of flavors to suit your personal fancy and the recipes are not complicated, nor do they call for hard-to-find ingredients.  you won't be disappointed!
0471267554|5.0|Great read. Having become interested in low carb diets for fat loss this book was certainly excellent reading to give another perspective on the benefits of a low carb paleo type diet. I would highly recommend this book!

B0038VPB5W|3.0|The album sounds great so far, but it's really annoying that they'll just release a deluxe version in a few months. I can wait. For now I'll just stream it. So far so good, and it would be 5 stars if it was the full version.
0439023483|5.0|The book that I purchased as a used book was in excellent condition.    It was a great purchase. As I read the first couple of chapters I didn't think I was going to like it.  I'm not into futuristic science fiction. However, as the story progressed, the twists and turns kept my attention.  If you can get through the teen violence, you will like the story.  And the author does an excellent job of setting up the second book.  When I read a book that makes me think about it when I'm not reading, I consider it a good book.  This was a good book.
0345444051|5.0|My remarks pertain to the cover art of this Del Rey edition of \\"Childhood's End.\\" My 5-star rating is for the novel itself. I would rate the cover as a 1. It's a dreadful piece of quickie schlock, with no bearing on the book at all. Is this really the best this major publisher could do for one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written?
B002T9H2MO|5.0|A good movie entertains and makes you think.  A very good movie keep you thinking days and weeks later.    This is a very good movie.
B002VECM72|5.0|Great movie.  In my top 3 for 2009.  Even better in blue ray.
B000002H92|5.0|Jim Morrison and the Doors live, here's a good two and a half hour experience from start until the end, a take of different shows all compiled into one main event. This is classic rock-n-roll done so in the Doors fashion, their own unique brand of style - \\"Gloria\\", \\"The Music's Over\\", \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", \\"Unknown Soldier\\", there's also a few rarity songs included not available on the studio issues, -   Willie Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\", \\"Universal Mind\\", \\"Build Me A Woman\\", \\"Who Do You Love?\\". \\"In Concert\\" sets the stage right for the ultimate Doors experience, naturally including Jim Morrison's bizarre, intellectual poetry. There may be better Doors live shows available, most are on the high dollar side. This compilation is a cheaper way to hear most of the Doors best live stuff.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie version of Emma.  We had no comparison for it, having never seen any of the other movie versions of the story.  We decided to try this after enjoying \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen, and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. It is long, and must be viewed in pieces, but we enjoyed each character and every detail. The color and cinematography were beautiful, and the music only enhanced the drama. My only complaint would be being held captive to BBC advertisements at the beginning of every viewing.  Our DVD would not allow us to bypass these same advertisements we'd seen many times to go directly to scene selections to pick up where we left off.  If you are not an overly picky Austen fan, and you enjoy these kinds of British dramas, you will be very happy with this series.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|\\"Are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out here in France?\\"    - Hans Landa  \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is one of Quentin Tarantino's masterpieces, bar none. The film is brilliantly epic in every sense of the word.  I don't consider it a \\"war movie\\" at all, like some people do.  It could be considered a World War II movie since it features Hitler and the Nazis, but I still wouldn't call it exclusively that type of movie.  It's a wonderfully executed and artfully shot Tarantino shock drama.  THAT'S what it is, and it is done oh so well!  Christoph Waltz more than deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Hans Landa, the Gestapo security chief. He's what made the movie. As for Brad Pitt's character, Aldo, he can get a little annoying at times with that ridiculous accent. I personally would've loved to see someone other than Pitt play that role.  True, there isn't as much gore in this film when you compare it to Quentin's other films, but his signature shock twists are right up there with the best of them. \\"Inglourious\\" definitely made it into my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  As far as the Blu Ray features are concerned, I personally thought that they should have included longer and more in-depth features, but that doesn't detract from my 5-star rating.  The picture quality is exceptional, and the audio is fantastic on 5.1 surround sound speakers.  The bullets literally shake your floor!  Don't even rent this movie...BUY IT!  Oh and yes, let me not forget...for you potential buyers, a glass of milk!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I came to the movie, expecting to hate it. I can't stand Hollywood blockbusters for the simple (and stupid) reason that they are blockbusters and by definition popular. So I was prejudiced when I came to the movie.    Suprisingly, James Cameron, despite the heavy weight of hate stacked against him, managed to make me like this movie.     You can quickly and clearly see  the parrallels between the human conquest of Pandora and the European conquest of America (and other places). There are irritatingly stupid one dimensional characters such as the almost cartoonish (GI Joe action Hero type) Colonel Miles Quaritch and his evil CORPORATION boss.      But if you can forgive Cameron the propaganda, this film is actually quite good. Visually stunning, good plot (although perhaps slightly predictable - but which blockbuster plots aren't?) and it gets you thinking about our impact on the Earth.    Worthwhile movie, I'd recommend it.

B002ZG97RE|5.0|I loved the movie, but wish they had made it just a little longer to help the clarity of it. I also think the camera movement could have been slowed down just a hair. Damons acting was excellent and the action pace was great.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie delivers on everything that they say it is...  It's entertaining, has substsance, leaves you feeling good at the end,  and most of all, it's a true story! (-:   It kinda restores your faith in humanity to a degree.  Sandra Bullock, Tim Mcgraw, Quinton Aaron and all the other actors  and actresses deliver great performances and Bullock's best actress  Oscar win was well deserved I believe. The kid who plays Sandra Bullock's  little boy (Jae Head) is by far the most charismatic pint-sized scene-stealer   that I've seen in a long time!  He had me laughing throughout.   Just a great movie and definitely worth buying for your home collection!
B00007KLJJ|3.0|Foreshadowing happens early in Shekhar Kapur's bomb, The Four Feathers. Over the wailing \\"Oriental\\" vocals, reminiscent of India, Arabia or Persia, or even just the dystopias of near-future Los Angeles ([[ASIN:B000002IZM Blade Runner]]), anyway, reminiscent of the Other, we watch a good ol' boy rugby match at a military training college in late 19th century England. With each tackle and toss, the characters (and their destinies) are swiftly established: the cautious Harry Feversham (Heath Ledger), his reliable and loyal BFF, Jack (Wes Bentley, spectacularly beautiful), the child-like Castleton (Kris Marshall), and his protector, Trench (MICHAEL SHEEN!), and the guy who never listens to his mates to just pass the bloody ball, Willoughby (Rupert Penry-Jones). This juxtaposition of Eastern music set to the most stiff-upper-lip of British rituals, at the edge of Western imperialism's height, is indeed a nice moment. You can sense the blurring of boundaries, and how increasingly irrelevant Kipling's pronouncement becomes as colonies rebel and twains do, sometimes painfully, meet. It's an interesting comment on how much of British identity during the colonial period was defined elsewhere, away from the actual island.    But for a film with such a broad, epic palette, the story is much less concerned with the geopolitics of Orientalism. It barely touches these themes in any meaningful way (such a shame! Mr. Kapur, why!?), but instead it remains insular, telling its narrow story dutifully and telling it with very pretty aesthetics indeed. Mr. Kapur films some of those soul-trembling vistas with the same love and awe that dominated David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.    The story, based on a colonial-era novel by A.E.W. Mason ([[ASIN:1440059616 The Four Feathers (Classic Reprint)]]), explores the rocky road to redemption one scion of British imperialism must endure after he gets cold feet before his first orders to war. When Harry Feversham, one of the bright young stars in officer training, is given orders to ship from his cozy British Elysium to the harsh bloodletting in the Sudan (to replace, his superiors tell him, a British regiment which was slaughtered \\"to the man\\"), he waffles for a day or two and then resigns. No, thank you, old chap. This earns him the shock and scorn of his once-admiring loved ones. He receives four feathers, symbolizing cowardice, his fiancee breaks off the engagement and his old military father disowns him. After waffling a bit more, Harry decides it's worse to live like a social zombie and so he packs up his things and heads to Sudan anyway to see if he can earn back his manly pride.    In the meanwhile, his army buddies are having a helluva time beating off the repeated guerilla attacks of a local rebel leader, Muhammad Ahmad, the self-proclaimed Mahdi. In a beautifully filmed sequence, the British forces are ambushed - just as Harry comes barelling in to warn them. He spends the rest of the film collecting his friends and shipping them home - one has been blinded, one killed, another imprisoned. Eventually, his dedication, courage and strength earn everyone's admiration again. At one point, his friend, Abou (Djimon Hounsou), laughs at him for waaay overcompensating. After Harry confesses that he is a coward, Abou starts to laugh: \\"When I found you, you were half-dead in the desert! Traveling alone!\\"    There are some clever visual parallels which run throughout the film. When Harry and his fiancee, Ethne (Kate Hudson, so cute), announce their engagement, the British soldiers form a square around them, boxing in their celebratory dance. Later, this same square is used - to disastrous effect - as a military strategy in Sudan. The destruction of the square signals the end of our fancy British character's colonial confidence. (\\"You British walk too proudly upon the Earth,\\" Abou chides Harry in one scene.)    We could probably wax theoretical about how squares and sharp edges - Harry and his buddies are all crisp uniforms and clacking heels, and the most disastrous strategist turns out to be the one who was fussiest about keeping every hair in place - are placed in contrast to the rolling, softening dunes of the desert and the curve of Djimon Hounsou's biceps (which are glorious). No right angles here, old chaps! Similarly, Harry and Trench, in the lengthy sequence which accompanies their escape from prison, undergo radical physical changes, the sharp edges of their haircuts and jawlines are replaced by unruly beards and haphazard curls. This reminded us of a brilliant bit in Michael Ondaatje's [[ASIN:0679745203 The English Patient]], when the narrator marvels at the changes undergone by the Canadian thief, Caravaggio, during his time in wartorn Italy: the exact description is that he's been \\"softened\\".    Djimon Hounsou seems perpetually stuck in the stereotypical and limited role of the noble savage. As usual, he is dignified and physically magnificent, and our (white) heroes rely on his sympathy and aid to get them through this Foreign Adventure. Okay. Sure. Fine. When will he stop being the Other? Mr. Hounsou, please fight against this type-casting! You can be Anakin Skywalker in our Star Wars-as-neo-dystopia remake!    Heath Ledger's performance is charming and authentic, his inherent likability making even the earlier scenes, when Harry chickens out, entirely sympathetic. Wes Bentley, who disappeared from films after his smash debut in American Beauty and has now reemerged after rehab from drug addiction is almost mind-blowingly beautiful. His role is likewise built to maintain an aura of modest heroism. That said, he could have invested an interesting character with a lot more depth, but he keeps things just skin-deep. We have a soft spot for Kate Hudson, since we love Goldie Hawn, but she has absolutely nothing to do - this is a very male-only film.    We saw this in theatres back in 2002, and remembered it only for being vaguely insubstantial and unsatisfying. Now, with the sharpening of our movie feelings thanks to this blog (yay PPCC!), we can identify that airiness as coming from a lack of follow-through: Kapur had such an opportunity to inject this movie with passion - about politics, about colonialism, about machismo or about forgiveness - but he never really goes for it. Anyway, the reason we came back to it now was because of our Michael Sheen binge, and his role, as the clownish officer Trench, who later becomes a prisoner of war, is (we were surprised to realize!) one of the only things which we did remember well from 2002. Harry's discovery of Trench in the thronging mob of Omdurman prison is a moment of almost magical elation - and Trench's recognition of Harry is even better.    Indeed, while the film frittered away a nice opportunity to say something more, it did do just service to a neat story - there are some brilliant, evocative moments centered around Harry's deception and recognition, and some moments were nice enough to yoke a tear or two. All in all, the narrative drive was fabulous, and we reckon we could use this story as an example on how to build a good plot structure when we write the book that will make us millions: Movies: A Guide to Life and Watching Movies.    *Review originally published at [...]
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Just your basic disaster movie. Nothing new here. I got bored with it quickly. Only bright spot in this movie was Woody Harrelson's character.
0446580945|4.0|This is definitely one of Spark's top novels based on one thing, reality. This book does not give you a fairy tale ending but it still has every love guru on the edge of their seats. Spark's use of romantic vocabulary and word choice captures the reader just like he does in every novel but this time it is a fairy tale beginning as opposed to a fairy tale ending which is what Nicholas Spark's fans are used to. This novel differs because it forces readers to live in the moment with characters John Tyree and Savannah Lynn Curtis as they live each day as it were their last day together. Spark's word choice and point of view in which the story is told keeps readers going and makes them enjoy the entire novel as opposed to waiting for a surprise ending.    While John is on leave in North Carolina and starts to fall for Savannah Sparks could have focused on the fact that he was leaving and that he might never get to see her again but instead he focuses on the moment that is happening between the two of them. \\"Living in the moment\\" is a reoccurring theme indicator throughout the novel because once John leaves for all they know it could be their last moment together. When they are starting to say goodbye for the first time John reflects, \\"Beneath us, I could hear the waves crashing against the pilings. A flock of seagulls passed overhead, and I leaned in to kiss her, my lips barely brushing hers. Her breath smelled of cinnamon and mint, and I thought again of coming home\\" (139). Nicholas Sparks has the characters reflect in such a beautiful way because he is realistic in this novel and doesn't try and fool anyone into thinking that these characters will be together forever and nothing will change that because reality is that something will come between them, especially distance.    When something eventually does get in the way of their relationship they both still manage to focus on the positives of their relationship and take advantage of the time that they have had together. Savannah writes to John, \\"You're a rare gentleman, and I treasure that about you. In all the time we were together, you never pressed me to sleep with you, and I can't tell you how much that meant to me. It made what we had seem even more special, and that's how I always want to remember my time with you. Like a pure white light, breathtaking to behold\\" (168). Not many people can describe a relationship with a pure white light unless they really understand and are experiencing true love. At this point they are both going different places in life but they still share these emotions that keep them connected for a lifetime.   After fate leads them in different places they still have these moments that they have both captured in their minds to remember their relationship together. Sparks is realistic in his novel by describing each moment as if it were their last because in reality not everyone can stay together forever. Fate works in mysterious ways and as they reminisce together Savannah says, \\"It's strange how fate works\\" (314) and he thinks to himself, \\"What happened between us was beautiful\\" (315) even though things are not picture perfect, they are still beautiful to him. Not everyone is able to stay together forever which is why the author stresses the moments that they have together.   Obviously both the readers and the characters would hope for a fairy tale ending but that just can't happen in every book that Nicholas Sparks writes. I believe that this is one of his best because it has a realistic ending and it is even better because the story is relatable. I even know from personal experience that loosing someone who is serving is one of the hardest things to do in life, and you really live each moment like it was your last and take in moments just as Nicholas Sparks writes them so that you get the most out of everything in life.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|I do not want to write a long writeup - but this movie was very bad.  The idea of an Alien camp drew me to the movie.  I thought it was going to be a great movie  Here is what is wrong with the movie.    1) Clips from previews where not in the actual movie. For example, in a preview they asked an Alien why they where here.  The Alien replied we cannot leave you are holding our ship.  That is one of the clips that are not in the movie.  It is almost like they changed the movie at the last minute.    2) Every other word was the F word.    3) Many flaws in the story and plot flow.  It was like watching a small child playing.  The flow and plot was inconsistent.    The reason they where stranded was because their space ship would not work. They where stranded on our planet.    In the end they found to return to their spaceship so that they could fly away, not to repair it jsut to fly away.      They worked for years to repair small space ship to fly back to their ship suspended in mid-air.  The military blew that us instead they used a remote they always ahd to beam them to the ship.  Why would they wait for years when they ALWAYS had the remote!!?!?  How did they fly away when the ship was BROKEN the reason they where stranded??!    There where many inconsistencies like this in the movie.  It was a horrible movie.  Acting directing was bad.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|Moon, a pensive and spare sci-fi film, may not have much cross genre appeal - it's too slow and opaque for that - but, for those who enjoyed [[ASIN:0156027607 Solaris]] (er, the book), [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (uh, the movie) and other thoughtful sci-fi classics, this will be a treat indeed.    Unfortunately, much of the plot is best kept secret, as there are great narrative moments which hinge entirely on the revelations encountered by Moon's solitary protagonist, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). Sam, bedraggled, lonely and infinitely bored, is just nearing the last two weeks of his three-year contract on the moon, where he manages an energy harvesting base station. It is the near future, and Lunar Industries has solved Earth's energy crisis with a new source of clean fuel: moon rock... or something. The details aren't important, as it's not the technology of Moon which is its point, it's its heroic quest for Sam (if you can call it that). After experiencing some hallucinations and mysterious blips in his days (pretty par for the course when it comes to lonely astronauts on film), Sam takes one of the cruisers out to check on a broken moon rock harvester... or whatever. On his way, he gets distracted by something and hits the harvester. He wakes up later, back in the lunar station's infirmary, and there begins his tumble down the rabbit hole.    A film as ponderous and minimalist as this made us worried that it would go for a weird, ambiguous ending - thankfully, Moon does actually, really, truly end, and it's a pretty satisfying conclusion to a slow, methodical build-up. For a movie about the blurring of reality and identity, with a protagonist leaving smudges and stains on his fancy lunar station, everything finishes quite tidily.    Sam Rockwell carries the film with ease - ranging from the vitality of Sam at his highs to the wretched wasting away of Sam at his lows. Kevin Spacey provides the voice of Gerty, Sam's station computer, and - while we were distracted by the fact that (1) Gerty was \\"I can't let you leave, Sam!\\"-ing under HAL 9000's lengthy shadow, and (2) Kevin Spacey lives in London now, right? is this why he's in this British film? just wondering - he is fine. There is no other character of importance. Um, sort of.     It's nice to see genuine sci-fi now and again, since the genre seems to have been kidnapped by comic book fanbeings and big explosions ever since George Lucas decided to revive Star Wars (and then murder it repeatedly). Everything's gone a bit pulpy and popcorn-brained, and we can't think of a single sci-fi film from the last 10 years that was confident enough to be (1) slow, (2) filmed on a low budget, and (3) not using any guns or lasers or aliens or killer robots. The only film that sort of approached serious sci-fi high art recently was [[ASIN:B000Y7U98C Sunshine]], but then it too was derailed into a sort of half-baked [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] sequel (and, much as we love Sam Neill, the world really only needs one Event Horizon). Moon then is refreshing in its adult simplicity.     *Review originally published at The Post-Punk Cinema Club: [...]
B002VPE1AW|5.0|.  Okay, so people are upset that this DVD hasn't got extras and isn't 3D.  The movie itself is great.  I had not seen it in the theater because I can't see the 3D.  But I really don't think I missed much.  The screen is filled with lush vibrant visuals.  James Cameron may go way over budget with his movies, but every dollar is up there on the screen.  I have never seen anything like it.  The movie clocks in at nearly three hours.  Do we really need a director's cut that makes it longer?  It already felt complete to me.    And as far as it not being in 3D.  How many people have gone out and bought a 3D TV yet?  Not to many, I bet.  That is why they didn't release it in 3D  Even if I could see the 3D I would not buy a 3D TV.  Who wants to wear those stupid looking glasses just to watch TV?  If you enjoy well made action movies you can't go wrong with Avatar.  It is fantastic!  I can't wait for the sequel.
B000008B01|5.0|One of the greatest, from one of Brazil's best. Listening to this album soothes your worries away and puts rhythm in your step. Its minimalism enhances its beautiful and clever arrangements. For me, a transformative work.
184744346X|5.0|Finally, the book I just could not put down!  Amazingly, I could \\"hear\\" Ozzy narrating his life story. The dialogue is phenomenal. I have laughed out loud repeatedly, although there are times I have been stopped in my tracks feeling the fears and emotional misunderstandings Ozzy faced throughout his life. From cover to cover the most well-executed book I have ever read! Thank you so much for sharing your journey!
0385528752|5.0|Such a big inspiration this book! I love it! It makes you think about all kinds of changes and how you can realise those changes more effectively than just pushing and reasoning.  The book is structured like the first book from the Heath brothers 'Made to stick': short chaptures, lots of examples, clinics to make you practice, and summaries with the most striking example to help you remember the most important things. That helps to digest it easily.  Now the biggest challenge is to really implement it, it is not easy!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Excellent Box Set.  The mono version helps eliminate the extreme panning prevelant in the orginal stereo recordings.  While the sound is not quite as clear as the stereo version at least you don't have the instruments and vocals split between the spearkers.  Overall, a great set!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|The start and middle were very good and interesting, the ending was slow.  It almost seemed like she couldn't wait for it to end, just like a prison sentence.
B000JLTRKE|3.0|Expected more but was just ok. Back when the whole 9/11 thing was hyped and was a big deal I expected a decent film out of it but so far this is the best one and it's just ok. If you cared about the events it might be more interested, I don't however (my perogotive) and felt it was probably overdue at the time.<br /><br />Nic Cage was very grim in this one, in fact the whole thing lacked pizzazz and a decent story.<br /><br />Sorry.
0060987464|5.0|I started reading this book expecting it to be a fairly brief description of the life of Brian Warner/Marilyn Manson, but I was very pleasantly surprised when great details about his thinking, and life experiences were brought out in the first couple chapters. I had never realized some of the motives behind his music, and why he had such a horrible reputation at venues for his performances. After reading this book I find him to be a much more interesting individual, and it almost frightens me how much of a genius he is. There are elaborate reasons for everything he does in his shows, and for the lyrics in his songs. People took things out of context, or didn't understand them when he was at his prime, and thus gave him a really bad reputation that has carried over to what people think about him today. Read the book and you will understand what I mean.
B002VECM6S|2.0|I absolutely loved the movie when viewing it at the theatre, however upon viewing my copy I recently purchased, it appeared to be a bad copy.  The first 40 mins or so of the video is extremely dark....  I was unhappy with the quality.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|One would have to live several lifetimes to see as much of planet Earth in the way this excellent BBC production presents it. The price  of this collection is absurdly undervalued. For most of us, we would never, in our lifetimes, see any of these places we so leisurely view from the comfort of our armchairs, thanks to the brilliant producers of this series at BBC. Words beggar for expression of the beauty and diversity of planet Earth as we fly along or dive deep into her hidden pristine places, see exotic life forms living in unimaginably impossible milieu. Need it be repeated , a picture is worth a thousand words, this series worth is priceless.If there are inhabited extraterrestrial planets out there, I would bet we have some of the most exotic places in the Universe right here on our home planet. Once again, thanks to BBC, we can appreciate it in silenced awe over and over again.If you do not own this series, you have an empty space in your collection that can not be matched by anything but Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Today we received on its release date, the newly restored version of Pride and Prejudice  with Collin Firth and Jennifer Eyhle.  And we are delighted.  The colors and complections are healthy and vibrant.  The sound is clear and offers extra enjoyment for the dance and singing scenes.  And special mention must be made of the detail that is now available to be ejoyed.  It is a historic costumers delight now, since the fine fabrics and textures can now be appreciated - it is far clearer and better detailed than the earlier versions of this spectacular mini-series.    And no advertising at the beginning - put it in and it starts.    I think they did a fantastic job restoring this, and this version has addressed  the earlier complaints of the yellow or washed out color palate.  I have also not noticed the deletion of any scenes from the original on video when it was first released.  This is definately the version the collectors to keep.    FOR SOME REASONE AMAZON IS ATTACHING THE REVIEWS FOR THE 2001 DVD EDITION.  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NEWLY RESTORED VERSION OF APRIL 2010.
B001BMXFX0|5.0|Hold on because this book grips you by the seat of your pants from the first chapter and doesn't let go until the very end!  Along the way, your emotions will run the full gamut, but mostly sadness.  Some may find it too sad and disturbing.  My co-worker tried to read it, but had to quit because it bothered her so much.  I have not seen the movie, and I doubt it can compare to this book.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  I mean, it was so hard to stop reading  that I went to work on 2 hours sleep so I could stay up and finish it. Alice Sebold is a great writer and I can't wait to see what else she comes up with.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I love this cd.  It is soft, yet edgy; lively and thoughtful..  It's a pleasant mix of upbeat and sweet..  I listen to it first thing each morning to get me in a nice groove.  This cd is recommended..
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Even 3D could not save this movie from being dull, even though it is the highest grossing film in history.  Sure, the special effects were good, but the story line was weak.  Actually, the story line was beyond weak.  This movie just dragged and dragged.  It was like trying to start a car.  It would crank and crank but just would not start.  This is one of the rare movies I should have walked out on and asked for my money back.  This movie was definately geared towards little kids and teenagers, but not adults.
B001AEF6D6|4.0|My 20 year old grandson, while browsing through my DVD shelves, was appalled that I did not own this movie. He insisted it was \\"the best movie ever\\". I like Jeff Bridges and have several of his other movies (18 at last count), so, when I found this one used, I bought it. While I am sure this is not the worst movie Jeff Bridges ever made (I think that may be \\"In Search of America\\", a TV movie from 1971, which I also own) I don't think it's the best, either. But it does have some catchy scenes in it and, in the way of all Coen brothers' movies, it is generally entertaining. Who knew when we were amazed by Busby Berkeley's dance routines that they were pot dreams?  I can't bring myself to give it five stars, which will disappoint my grandson, but I think it earns a solid four.
B002VECM6S|5.0|In a time of such unwholesome movies, The   Blind Side is such a refreshing change.  The movie shows the Christ-like character of the Toehes(sp?).  I have watched it two times and now that I own it willbe watching it many more times.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Have been looking for a replacement for my third (and last) Belkin N52.  Belkin's newer offering isn't of interest.      Am not going to touch on each feature of the G13, but rather, just the features I like.    The Logitech G13 Game pad was out of the box, connected and installed in under 10 minutes.  Working through the device configuration is an ongoing matter, done as needed.  The only problem encountered is what to do with all the extra keys.  The device itself is a solid desktop component.  6 traction pads on the bottom keep it from shifting or moving under hand.  The Palm pad is simple in design, very comfortable and it works better for me than the contoured style palm rest.  22 keys on the main pad, two around the toggle and the toggle is also clickable downwards. The clear and easily read labels on the keys are difficult to see when gaming because of the angle presented at, but this hasn't presented a problem.  The Four main movement keys (WAS&D) contain minor divots allowing for swift re-orientation. The display panel offers; Stopwatch / Countdown; RSS News Feed; CPU & RAM Usage Monitors; Date and Time; A Power button. Additionally, though not employed in the games I play, the panel may be used to display in game equipment levels and other live game data from some games.    It's looks, though not unpleasant, took time to grow on me.  It's now a combination of a great functioning device with good physical features draws me to conclude it exceeded initial expectations.    Support is from Logitech, a wealth of information on each of its products. The G13 being no exception.  One picto-manual (no words) in 35+ languages on the G13.  The G13 site pages were surprisingly easy to navigate.     For any not aware of the advantage a game pad offers: Each movement or action is performed using the same key regardless of game being played.           PRO: Not having to learn new key maps to effectively play new games.         CON: Having to spend time configuring the Game Pad to the Games Key Map.         ie - If you use the 'G7' key to cast the spell sending all opponents to the Corn Field in one game.              The same G7 key would be used to throw the real big bomb and blow all away, in another game.      Game profiles are managed through the G-series Key Profiler.  Once the first profile is built, it can be used as a template for others. So once familiar with the game pad and configured to best support the personal style of play.  The resulting profile can be used as the base template for other games.  Having a pad set up properly allows the gamer to concentrate on the game play and not have to cross reference which key does what action.    Most telling comment I can pass along: If this one failed on me, I'd order a new one.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|After reading all of the fantastic reviews for Perfect Chemistry, I had no doubts in my mind that it'd be incredible. Needless to say, it was. With teenage angst, romance and an edgy passion that I rarely see in YA these days, this story is beautiful and dangerous at the same time.<br /><br />If S.E Hinton's The Outsiders and the movie She's All That had sex, this would be their baby. And I mean that in the most spectacular way possible. There was so much excitement and activity going on, adding and piling to the list of reasons why Alex and Brittany shouldn't be together. Gangs, violence, social standings, family, friends- it's even got a hint of Romeo and Juliet as well.<br /><br />This was without a doubt one of the sexiest books I've ever read. Young adult books tend to stray from racy scenes, but Simone Elkeles dives right into it and does it with grace and sauciness simultaneously. Alex and Brittany's relationship, though strained throughout the novel, was a really amazing thing to read about.,br><br />I think the only thing that turned me off was the cheesiness. I think it could've been turned down a notch, for it gets to be tiny bit clich&eacute; after awhile, but that's really the only thing I can negatively say.<br /><br />If you want to swoon, cry, gasp, cringe, laugh all in the same story, Perfect Chemistry is well .. perfect. After officially topping my list of all-time epic romance novels, I definitely recommend it anybody and everybody!
0140157352|4.0|This is another great book about how to communicate effectively in challenging situations. As the title suggests, it focuses particularly on negotiations, but the ideas are broadly applicable. The authors discuss the advantages of principled negotiation - negotiation that is based on merits - over positional bargaining. Good negotiation, they state, should produce a wise agreement, be efficient, and should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties. In essence, they are talking about a win-win rather than a win-lose situation. The four key points of principled negotiation are: 1) separate the people from the problem, 2) focus on interests, not positions, 3) brainstorm options, and 4) develop objective criteria for evaluating proposals. Much of the book is devoted to outlining these four key points in detail followed by a section on some difficult negotiation situations, such as how to negotiate when the other party has more power or they refuse to negotiate. The book concludes with a section of frequently asked questions about the method. This book is a great complement to Difficult Conversations.
0142414999|4.0|This was probably one of the cutest books I've ever read. It features three different stories, from three fantastic authors, but in it's own way- they all seem to intertwine perfectly. A teensy tiny character would be introduced in the first story, and would end up having a big role in the third. It was so easy to see that these three authors really put their heads together to make every piece fit.<br /><br />The first story, The Jubilee Express, written by Maureen Johnson, is about a girl named Jubilee, who gets whisked away from her usual comfortable Christmas routine, and tries to travel to her grandparent's house with unexpected trouble along the way. This was my least favorite story out of all of them. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, but everything just flew by way too fast. Even with the short length, I felt there could've been more progress between the characters.<br /><br />The second story is A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle, written by John Green. It involves three best friends, two guys and a girl, who try to journey through the harsh snow after receiving a call from their friend at The Waffle House, informing them of lonely cheerleaders taking shelter there. This was my favorite out of all three. It was so light-hearted and wonderfully written that I think I was smiling the entire time.<br /><br />The third story, The Patron Saint Of Pigs is written by Lauren Myracle. Addie must deal with the aftermath of cheating on her boyfriend, while trying to find a way to convince everybody that she's not self-centered. This was the one that really tied everything together, and it was the perfect tale to end the book.<br /><br />Overall, it was really good. It definitely lifted my spirits after reading it, and it just puts you in a happy mood. The ending of the book was perfect, and I was sad that there wasn't another story attached. It's not heavily Christmas-oriented, it's really just a time frame that it takes place, so you could really read it at anytime. I most definitely recommend!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a marvelous book! In fact all of the \\"Ender\\" books are fabulous! I am shocked and saddened to read the author's own responses to critizism. Why does the storyline have to be absolutely believable? Its science fiction! Isn't that the definition of science fiction? Not real! And to anyone who would pass up this great read because of the cover, Are you kidding me! If you want to judge this book by the cover and not by the synopsis, or better yet, fellow reader's reviews, then its your lose. Every book in the \\"Ender\\" series is well worth the read!
1416914307|5.0|As expected, City Of Glass is a fantastic third addition to the Mortal Instrument series. Following the steady continuation of butt-kicking characters, a forbidden romance and an almost unbeatable villain, I was easily sucked in!<br /><br />While it followed in the footsteps of most of the aspects of the first two books, City Of Glass had a different feel to it, because we got to step outside of New York and into the Shadowhunter world. It's a breath of fresh air from what we're used to, but it kind of ties the series together.<br /><br />So much is explained and revealed in this one. Questions after questions were built as the series progressed, but with the introduction of new characters and plot twists came much anticipated answers.<br /><br />Overall, City Of Glass was a terrific follow-up to City Of Ashes. With gasp-worthy twists, a new enemy and tons more action, I definitely recommend that you go pick this up if you haven't already! It's an incredible final adventure for the series through Clary's eyes!
1423101499|3.0|This book in the series just didn't have the same pull as the first 3 did.  The story lost me a little.  I think I expected more action while they were in the labyrinth.  But at times, I felt like the story was going in circles.  There are parts that I really liked.  The story of the labyrinth and it's place in the modern world was extremely interesting.  I loved that an actual human plays such an intricate part of the story.  I think the story weaving was better in this one.  It's starts to connect everything together and sets up for the final book.  Although this one made me curious what part the gods would actually play in the final battle.  They seem to interfere  (or help) and the strangest times and I'm not sure what they actually want out of the demigods.  I still think the author does a fantastic job of weaving Greek mythology into the story.  It reminds me how much I love mythology.
1416955070|5.0|I think I'm one of the last people to pick up this series. For some reason, I just had absolutely no interest in reading it. I heard it was incredible, I saw the high ratings on Goodreads, but nothing fazed me. I take great pleasure in telling you all that I am a gigantic idiot.<br /><br />City Of Bones is awesomely intense, action-packed and very hooking. With a world full of fantastically written magical elements, frightening creatures, and some seriously ass-kicking teenagers, it's obvious why so many people rave about this book.<br /><br />I absolutely love the characters, especially Clary and Jace. Though I knew from the beginning that I was going to be a hardcore Jace/Clary shipper, their banter and arguments had me cracking up. Clary, though she proves to be a brave and loyal character, still has her weaknesses and flaws. She wasn't one of those over-the-top independent female leads. And I was happy to see that even though this group of almost superhuman teenagers were fiercely strong, they all had their issues.<br /><br />But this is one of those series that you have to really pay attention to. If you're not reading it seriously, don't read it at all, because you're going to miss something. This is not a simple demon story; it's intricate and at some times, confusing, but it's a thrilling process to uncover the clues and foreshadows that the author throws at us.<br /><br />Overall, City Of Bones (and the rest of the Mortal Instruments series) has landed a spot on my favorite shelf. Complete with nail-biting action, sweat-inducing passion and a page-turning plot twist that will leave you speechless, it was the perfect first book to an incredible series.
B00328G4V6|1.0|My VERY FIRST recording review... I was moved to write this.    A heard 'Red House' on XM radio, on the way home from work.  I must have been in a rare mood, for I rushed in the house and ordered this CD from Amazon.  I'm SORELY disappointed; this tape belongs back on the cutting room floor;  there's good reason why Jimi didn't allow this material to be released.    At the same time, I'm utterly amazed that so many people gave favorable reviews to this release.  Far be it for me to comment on other peoples' taste... but this CD will be sent to a friend,  who calls himself 'Jimi Fan', so as to add to his archives; I hope he isn't offended.    Not worth a second listen, to me.  (and wishing I had my $10 back)
0545123267|5.0|Maggie Stiefvater did an amazing job with this story. The plot was simple, but she wrote it so beautifully and attracting. I was hooked, line and sinker, just after the first chapter. Though I was excited about this book, I was worried that it might have that Twilight-esque feel to it, but any pre-conceived notion about that was thrown right out the window.<br /><br />Grace and Sam are portrayed as regular, all-around normal teenagers. There's no strong personality traits getting in the way of their relationship, and there's no complicated angst to keep them separated. They work through the story with their hearts in tact, and with no clich&eacute; teenage problems, which made me extremely happy.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed were the lack of characters. Most of the time, I find that a flaw in stories, but with a story like this- it's good to keep things leveled. Maggie introduced just a few key characters, who will more than likely play key roles in the future books of the series. Each character was different, defined and contributed amazingly to the plot.<br /><br />I laughed (Sam is extremely cute), cried, smiled, yelled, and went through the whole chain of emotions with this one. It's a love story without all the cheesy fluffing. All in all, this is right up there on my list of favorite books of all time. It's that good.<br /><br />So my suggestion, if you haven't read it yet- drop everything and find a way to get your hands on a copy. Everything about it, right down to the beautiful shiny cover, is incredible!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like this workout.  I'm in shape and work out daily.  I do Jillian's DVD called No More Trouble Zones every 3 days - and I do Leslie Sansone walking videos the other days.  I started putting this one into my rotation now.  I'm only up to Level 1.  I tried Level 2 but I'm not ready for it yet.  So - it is good to know that I won't immediately outgrow this DVD.  I would recommend it for people who really want to see a difference in their body shape quickly.  I would not recommend it for the slow/steady exerciser, or anyone who is not willing to really work and do hard exercises.  Jillian even says if you're going to work out for 20 minutes, there's no resting.  You have to make every minute count.  She makes big promises and she has to keep them!  That means you're working out hard for the full 20 minutes.  So - yes, I would buy it again.  Yes, I like that there are three levels to work up through.  Yes - it's a fun workout and easy to follow.  I'd recommend it - but just realize it isn't a walk in the park :)  You can do it though!  Oh - and also, it comes in handy to have a 20 minute workout some days when you get up late - or you need to unstress.
1416972242|5.0|City Of Ashes was a perfect second installment to the exhilarating Mortal Instrument series. Though City Of Bones captured me with a higher intensity, I loved every minute of Ashes just the same.<br /><br />The story continues with Clary's difficult search for her mother, while she battles new enemies and her forbidden feelings for Jace, who has unexpectedly turned out to be her older brother. The emotions and drama of the characters played a much bigger part in this one, making it much more personal than Bones. Whether it was a frowned-upon-by-society kind of romance, wrongful accusations or even sexuality .. Cassandra Clare did a great job of making those issues just as scary as demons and monsters that Shadowhunters kill.<br /><br />Joining the original cast of characters were a few newcomers, friends and enemies alike. And joining the old plot came a handful of twists and turns that I never saw coming. The Mortal Instruments series is getting away with things that normal young adult books can't pull off, and I think that's why I love it so much so far.<br /><br />Overall, if you've read the first book, I demand that you get off your butt and go pick up a copy of this now. You definitely won't be disappointed! And while you're at it, get the third book, City Of Glass, as well because the ending in City Of Ashes will have you dying for more!
B002ZCDR88|1.0|WTF happened to Natalie Merchants voice? I'm a huge fan but was utterly perplexed when I bought the Motherland album and her voice sounded like she had been chain smoking non-filter Camels. Then I hear some excerpts from this album and it's the same thing all over again. If the rest of the album sounds like the couple songs I've heard this is the end of Natalie Merchant as a megastar. Her voice is shot. Maybe it's just age I don't know but it's very disappointing to see someone with such an incredible voice gone sour keep trying to pump out music when she should probably be writing for other artists now. After all her lyrics are incredible.
014241493X|4.0|I was taking a shot in the dark when I picked this one up. I knew nothing about it, and I was honestly kind of hesitant considering I wasn't a huge fan of Looking For Alaska. But Paper Town surprisingly hooked me.<br /><br />Margo Roth Spiegelman- the mystery of the story- I said this on Twitter, but I'll say it again. If she was real, and I knew her, I would most likely punch her in the face. I was all for her at first, when her and Quentin were joyriding around all night, but after her disappearance I just found myself constantly annoyed. Leaving breadcrumbs- even if it isn't intentional- in your departure so people can worry and obsess and search for you? Not cool. But even though I ended up extremely disliking her, I wouldn't want it any other way. She clashes well with the story, and with the characters, and in it's own way .. it's kind of perfect.<br /><br />I'm walking on eggshells here, trying to find how to write about this book without giving anything away. This story unfolds slowly, clue by clue, and everything always ends up leading to something else. It's tricky to explain, but wickedly fun to read- like you're putting yourself in the book and joining the search for Margo with Quentin and company.<br /><br />Overall, this book really kept me going and going. When Quentin, the main character, discovered a clue- I'd get excited for him. When that clue turned out to be a fluke- I'd be disappointed for him. It's extremely enthralling to read, and I definitely recommend it. I've even heard it's being made into a movie next year, which is pretty awesome. I can totally see it being adapted to the big screen.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Although the item came very quickly (within a few days), it is not in the shape the seller described. The box is sticky & there's even food all over it! I didn't contact the seller because I think can clean some of it (the box will probably be even more damaged though) & it's just a movie, but it certainly is not what I paid for.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I had seen little snippets of this film on Oprah, but I knew I wanted to watch the whole thing.  I watched it the day it arrived from Amazon and it changed my life!  I haven't been to McDonald's since!  I also now buy only organic produce at the farmer's market or at the grocer, when necessary.  I also buy only local, grass-fed pork and beef.  I feel so much better about my choices now.      I think everyone should see this film!
B001PPLJIQ|1.0|This film is repulsive.  Mass murder is romanticized and glorified.  Kate Winslet's character \\"knowingly\\" committed mass murder when she allowed innocents to burn alive in an enclosed church. During the trial she is asked if she would have been fired as a guard (her job in the Nazi camps)if she (and she could have!!!) opened the church doors to allow these people's escape; she answered no her job would not have been jepordized. This is cold, calculated, \\"I enjoy this\\" (aka, sadism) MURDER.    Her character also had jews in the camps read to her before they were sent to their deaths.  This is utterly revolting.  Kate's character is illiterate (we find out later in the film) and jacks off by having these literate Jews read to her before their deaths.  Simple analysis, I hate you, I am not you.  The film tries to revoltingly glorify this by making you believe she sees their humanity.  Oh yeah, I see your humanity, you burn to death. (For Christ sake call the international authorities, if the local ones won't help)  This film needs to be banned.  It is morally offensive and intellectually perverse beyond belief.  Charles Manson killed less people.  An insect is an insect.   Another point she is 40 and sleeping with a pubescent sixteen year old.  This is stuatory rape in the U.S.  The perversion trying to pass as intellectualism and romanticism in this movie is beyond comprehension.  Get some help everyone involved in its concepcion.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|I seriously don't see how people aren't in love with this movie. It's so captivating.
B0034JKZ3G|3.0|The movie was enjoyable even though it took me awhile to become interested in the story.  The songs were not memorable.  In fact, none of the songs I can remember nor will I find myself humming their tune or singing their lyrics.  Perhaps it has to do with the setting and the style of songs.  When I can remember every song from The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, and the other 80-90's Disney films and I have no desire to remember the songs from The Princess Frog, then I know that it is not in the same caliber of movie.  Certainly Disney did an excellent job at the animation, but this movie should be compared to other mediocre films from Dreamworks...or even another Land Before Time film.  The entire movie was predictable and frequently ripped off other Disney films.  Some will say it is paying tribute to the other Disney films, but it seems more like they did not have original ideas so they just pulled from the movies that were infinitely better.<br /><br />Again, it is not a bad movie at all and I enjoyed the experience, but it cannot be classified as Classic Disney.  The Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy bundle is the best deal as it gives you more movie than any other bundle you can buy for the movie.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|I love this show from the moment it aired. My daughter turned my eye to it. And every Friday we were glued. Every Friday...DAMN I miss it and can't wait for the second season. I hope they come harder than the first bringing nothing but boldness, blood and sand. And much much Glory. If people didn't like the show well you should've turned!!! I watch the reruns. And Thank the good one above for SHOWS ON DEMAND. I love 300 so the blood effects didn't bother me matter of fact beside the acting of very very fine ass men. If I didn't see any ass in the show I expected to see the blood. This isn't for the weak or pansy. At all its only for those True Gladiators out there. Can you all say it with me? SPARTACUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
0385504225|3.0|On Amazon alone as of today, there are more than 2,400 reviews of Dan Brown's latest novel, \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" so there's little need for another one covering the book's entirety.  Brown has written better books, and worse.  Overall this one is an entertaining but uneven diversion with a fairly preachy exhortation at its end.<br /><br />The most compelling element in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is the antagonist Mal'akh.  I've read all Brown's novels, and consistently have found the vast majority of the characters populating them uniformly flat and two-dimensional.  Not so with Mal'akh. (In modern Hebrew, mal'akh is the general word for \\"angel.\\")  Brown does a great job endowing this character with dimension, depth, pain, and even a touch of pathos.  Of all the characters Brown has created for his novels, Mal'akh is by far the most interesting; more interesting even, dare I say, than the redoubtable Robert Langdon himself.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is just amazing. Its now been a few years since I purchased this set and I am going back reviewing all my old purchases. In that time I have grown to appreciate the whole trilogy even more. This epic film being the middle one is the gateway film of the series. It is when it all goes wrong. You could compare this to Empire Strikes Back, in that, the characters are faced with decisions that impact them until the end of the series.<br /><br />Peter Jackson pulls off amazing feats with this installation. You really feel for the characters, appreciate the choices they make and root for them as they battle their way to their fate. Cinematography that is beautiful, characters we can relate to, epic music; you need to get this and the others in this set.<br /><br />I am totally looking forward to The Hobbit<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I've enjoyed many of Cameron's films over the years: The Terminator films, Aliens, The Abyss, Titanic.  However I guess the 11 academy awards won by Titanic alowed Cameron to come out of the closet and announce to the world that yes, he is just another tired America-bashing leftist.  Now don't get me wrong Avatar stunk on many levels: the plot was basically a Dances with Wolves rehash, the environmental message silly and done before.  However I love the fact that although the military men appear to be a renegade mercenary army bought and paid for the evil corporation exploiting the planet, they clearly appear to be U.S. Marines (commanded by the cliched, stereotypical  Southern psychopath) and we are supposed to cheer when they are killed by the angel-like aliens.  Yay.  (Perhaps if Cameron and one of his film crews get into trouble while filming in a hostile country, he can have the aliens from Avatar come to his aid.)  This is a stupid, tired film from the word go.  The 3D was impressive for the first few minutes.  Afterward, you forgot that you were watching a 3D film.  (Gee you don't suppose the fact that 3D and IMAX tickets cost a lot more had anything to do with this film being the highest grosser of all-time?)  If you enjoy a silly and insipid film with a plot that has been done before, Avatar is the film for you. (A friend saw this film before I did and told me that it would make my blood boil.  It really didn't: I just thought the film plain stunk.)  As for Cameron, he has now joined a long list of many others in Hollywood who will no longer see a dime of my money.
B00275EGWY|3.0|I thought this movie would be better.  I wish I would have seen this before I bought it.
B000FC10WU|3.0|Okay, so I'm a fan of Miss Marple, and this is a fine story, so on that count I give it five stars.    But in reading it on the Kindle, while the visual format is fine, there is a rather annoying problem: all speaking parts begin with a reverse apostrophy instead of a quotation. The effect of this is that when your start the text-to-speach (TTS) function, every speaking part opens with the Kindle saying \\"backquote,\\" as in     'I did not commit that murder!' being read as \\"backquoteI did not commit that murder.\\" Minus two stars.    Perhaps the publisher will fix that and push the repaired version to our Kindles. Or maybe it's just a new technique for saying on th ebook page that TTS is enabled, but still maintain their audiobook sales.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side was an American classic, and one that my family and I have watched several times over the past month.  A true story of a great kid, raised in the worst of circumstances but when given the opportunity, rose to his full potential.  This is an inspirational \\"rags to riches\\" movie that should appeal to everyone!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Walt Kowalski is a man who seems nearly impossible to get along with.  His kids make attempts (albeit poor ones), his self-involved granddaughter, and even a 27-year-old \\"virgin\\" Catholic priest.  It seems that the only person who had any kind of deep connection with him, was his wife.  Any of us who have never been involved in a war, couldn't possibly understand what it does to a person.  It becomes clear that Walt is carrying tremendous guilt about the things he's done in the Korean War.  He can't let it go.  He buries himself in his anger and contempt for nearly everyone else, especially including a Hmong family who has moved in next door.<br /><br />Right from the get-go, it's clear that Walt can't stand them.  They remind him too much of the people he fought against in Korea.  Walt is so used to insulting nearly everyone he meets, that it's practically second nature to him.  It's his defense mechanism, so that he can never have to have a deep connection with anyone.  The only people who can stand him are a couple of drinking buddies at a bar, the town barber, and the town construction supervisor.<br /><br />One night, Thao, the young son of the Hmong family, is pressured by a Hmong gang to attempt to steal Walt's car (the 1972 Gran Torino) as part of a gang initiation.  Walt catches him in the act, which only seems to cement his hatred of them.  When Thao resists doing anything else for the gang, he is threatened by them, and lo and behold, his \\"savior\\" happens to be Walt holding an old-style rifle used in the Korea War.  Walt, of course, couldn't care less about Thao, but simply wants them all off his lawn.  Little does Walt realize, that this simple act of protection has opened a door, he never sees.<br /><br />Sue is Thao's older sister.  It's clear that she likes Walt, despite his offensive remarks.  Through Sue, Walt begins to find a connection with the Hmong.  \\"I have more in common with these people than I do my own family!\\" he quips.  He's invited to a Hmong gathering, and strange enough to Walt, he's enjoying himself.  Thao is forced to do odd-jobs for Walt to pay off his debt for his attempt to steal Walt's car.  This gives Walt yet another connection...ironically enough to the boy who attempted to steal his car.  Walt sees that Thao isn't like the kids in the Hmong gang, but that this boy actually has a chance to do something with his life.  Walt realizes that this probably won't happen as long as the Hmong gang continues to terrorize Thao and his family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is arguably one of the best directors in the business.  Some people have complained about the acting of the Hmong cast.  I didn't have a problem with it.  They aren't professional actors, and that is okay.  Instead, it's as if they are simply playing themselves.  Their lines almost seem improvisational and not from a script.  For this film, it works well.  I was especially impressed by young Ahney Her (Sue).  I felt that she wonderfully created the bridge between Sue and Walt.  She's tough, and yet kind and sensitive.  That is a pretty good balance to achieve for a first-time actress.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is carrying a heavy burden of guilt.  The priest attempts to help Walt, but as Walt explains to him, \\"You know nothing about life and death, kid.\\"  The priest realizes that Walt is correct.  The priest has never been in a war, nor has ever been asked to take a life because it was his job; and to learn to hate a group of people to help you perform that job.  Like a poison, the anger and guilt is eating Walt up.  Despite what Walt says to the contrary, it's evident that Walt loves Sue and Thao as if they were his own kids.  He helps them, looks after them, and protects them from something he never wants them to ever have to be a part of.<br /><br />Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting job, and boy, does he end his illustrious career with an incredible film.  It's about the power of redemption; about finding a way of excisingyourself of the demons that nearly everyone carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.  Some scenes are difficult to watch, and strangely enough, we get used to Walt's constant racial slurs.  I think the reason for this is, that to most of the audience who knows and understands Walt Kowalski, he doesn't really mean it.  He simply doesn't know any other way to communicate.<br /><br />Gran Torino may not seem like a masterpiece, but is really comes close.  For Eastwood's final curtain call, Gran Torino has a lot of power in its message, and many may well view it as a masterpiece.carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.

B0030MM68O|3.0|I watched this movie in mid-January, and I was surprised to find that it was later being considered for best picture because it's not even what I would call a good picture.    The problem is the story. It's unfinished. It leaves too many questions unanswered. I know some movies let the viewer use their imagination, but this technique is generally used sparingly. In Hurt Locker, I don't know what happened on quite a few plot points.    - Did the butcher with the cell phone get caught?  - Was the little boy who played soccer killed, or was that him asking to play soccer later in the movie?  - Were the two guys they shot (that were dragging their squad-mate down a dark street) the ones who set off the big bomb?    And on an on it goes. This movie was OK, but unfinished.    I think all of the accolades for this movie come from several people being told that it's good, and so they pile on the bandwagon. It's the emperor's new clothes. Well, I'm not afraid to say he's naked. This was just an average movie at best.

0812973992|3.0|I read this book after I saw a review for it in the paper, then on the news.  I enjoyed the concept, but the story got a bot boring.  Its basically like the movie \\"Crash,\\" where there is one central focus, and a bunch of different peoples perspective relating to the focus.  Its the 1970's in NYC and there is a tight rope walker between the 2 World Trade Center buildings.  This is the focus, but then each chapter tells about what is going on in each characters life.  I enjoyed some of the descriptions of NYC in the 70's. I also liked the fact that a lot of times, we forget that we are all somehow intertwined.  We know what is going on in our own worlds and we forget  that the world doesn't revolve around us.  This book shows that.  Although everyone has seen or heard about the tight rope walker, we all have different things going on in our lives.  Maybe this book will make people a little more compassionate next time someone in the street bumps into them.  Maybe there is something going on in their lives, and they weren't just out to bump into you.  Again, good concept, i just got a little bored with some of the stories, and frankly couldn't wait to finish it.
1439102813|5.0|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) hasn't affected my family (that I'm aware of), but my best friend did lose her mother to AD.  This book was a great learning experience for me, and now I'm passing along the book to her.  The subject matter might be a bit terrifying for her under the circumstances, but I know she'll really enjoy the story of Alice Howland.<br /><br />In the novel, Alice discovers she has early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.  She's 50 years old when she starts her descent into dementia.  She starts to forget things, gets lost, and eventually has to leave her teaching position at Harvard because she just can't professionally handle it any further.  \\"Being diagnosed with Alzheimer's is like being branded with a scarlet A,\\" she says.  And she's not far from the truth.  We begin to witness how differently people react around someone who they once considered a scholar and now can barely get out legible thoughts and sentences.<br /><br />It should be noted that author Lisa Genova has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.  She knows the subject matter very well.  She's studied diseases and talked to patients, and, therefore, understands not only the clinical side of the disease, but also the emotional side.  It's obvious that she's spoken with both AD patients and their families to build this fantastic novel about the fictional Alice.<br /><br />On top of the well-researched information relating to the disease contained in the novel, Genova adds human drama to the story.  Alice has a husband and three adult children.  They have family problems and conflicts, along with the added worry of AD.  While we don't get to know all of the supporting characters as well as I'd hope, Genova does a fantastic job of getting inside Alice's head, giving us the story from her perspective.  We get to witness the sudden decline of Alice's mental health over the course of only a couple of years.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|I have not seen this in the movies so I have no idea what is or isn't missing on the DVD.  Whatever it is, it wouldn't help. First off, the technology and the use of the Avatars was breath taking and that is the only interesting thing about this movie. And it was interesting for about 10 minutes. Oh, and Signourey Weaver, who improves any movie but couldn't save this mess.<br /><br />I can only quote J.R.R. Tolkein here: \\"I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.\\"<br /><br />Avatar harbors not just the presence of allegory, but hits you over the head with it, over and over again until you just want to fast forward and get it over with.  I guess I have just read and watched too much great science fiction over the last 50 years to be impressed with this shallow derivative script and characters. Happily \\"borrowing\\" from Dune, Deathworld Trilogy, Star Wars (think elongated Ewoks) and so on ad nauseum Cameron has churned out another bowl of paplum for the young that ranks right up there with \\"Titanic\\" for its banality.  Why not tell the REAL story of the Titanic instead of making up a boring story about a necklace?  Why not give us some depth and surprise in this utterly predictable plot?<br /><br />Don't buy this buy DVD unless you wish to encourage Cameron and his ilk.  Go and read some good sci fi and nourish your brain.  This kind of thing will only give you cerebral cavities.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Persona,which means originally the mask worn by actors and later transferred to the character represented by the actor.An actress,Elisabet Vogler(Liv Ullman),refuses to speak,while a nurse,Alma(Bibi Anderson) is assigned to her 'recovery'.Persona,Bergman's most modernistic,ruptured narrative,leads on from The Silence,wherein a psychic war between two women,demands a most challenging aesthetics.The same boy is used in both films.Most of the film takes place in and around a beach-house on the windswept coast of Faro.Bergman had two great actresses whom he used to mould and generate new and difficult meanings,in which our experience of identity,space,time and narrative undergoes radical change,as we suffer under interrupted and fragmenting layers of stimuli,exchange,transference and substitution between the actresses. Gazes and subjectivies cannabistically intermingle.There is a jarringly atonal soundtrack, wrapped up in modernistic imagist insertions fro the 20th century.<br /><br />Liv Ullman's silent portrayal of an artist confronting and performing her own ontological lack is alternatively twitching or impassive,ambivalent or vampiric.Bibi Andersson plays the chatty state carer whose perfectly adaptive nature leads to being sucked into her companion's showdown with negativity - so that she too is made to examine what, if anything, lies behind her own socially-ordained mask.There is one of the most erotic scenes in film as Alma recounts an encounter she and her friend have with two young men while they lie naked on a beach.There are also such an intimate coming together we get a mutation into a famous hybrid gaze-half of each woman's face grafted to the other-stares out from the greyness to destabilize the viewer's space.Diegetic space and the materiality of film intermingle,the dissonance of one affects the violence of the other and vice-versa.The celluloid appears to rip and burn.A catharsis is engendered of sorts between two acting styles,method and silence vs.eloquence and change.This revelatory study of character and creativity is a masterpiece.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|This is definitely an awesome movie and deserves 5 stars but I can only give it 4. James Cameron's love affair with profanity persist from Titanic and into this movie and I don't understand why. It does not enhance the movie at all and certainly cheapens it. Furthermore both God's and Jesus' name has to be used in vain. Doesn't he realize that bucket loads of kids are going to see this movie? Why trash it with a filthy mouth? Does profanity make the film more realistic, more exciting? It's a fantasy type movie. Someone tell me how this adds to the movie's enjoyment. The CGI is amazing but still flawed. You can see imperfections everywhere but it is so bold, you don't really care and the story is very interesting except humans are portrayed as evil, wanting something that if they don't get, the owner of that commodity is made into an enemy that must be destroyed. Otherwise, the movie is a must see, no doubt. I recommend it but with the reservations I mentioned.
0316017922|2.0|Those thinking Outliers reaches insightful, practical revelations will be disappointed. There IS food for thought here, but the author's verbose, yarn-spinning style is long on build up, some points are inadvertently contradicted,* and he has an annoying habit of interrupting a long yarn with a long sidebar that goes in excruciating detail as well. I found myself thinking (too often), \\"...and your point...?\\"  It's practicality is low-- example: \\"The Importance of Being Jewish\\", and cultural reasons why foreign commercial airliners crash. (Fifty pages on foreign plane crashes in a book about 'success'?)     *He summarizes that wealth creates higher success rates for children ... then later tells us how children of impoverished Jewish immigrants (Mom & Dad often working 84hr wks in the garment district) disproportionally became doctors and lawyers. So which point does the author really want to leave us?
1594481717|5.0|This is a wonderful book and a fascinating, easy read. Whether the author is right about the future of right-brain dominance however is problematic as computer dominance (a left-brain function) is clearly primary in the business world today. I do believe in the importance of imaginative, creative thinking and perhaps people will wake up to the importance of right-brain thinking may eventually realize that computer manipulation has it's limitations. I would recommend this book particularly to anyone who is thinking about a career in design, advertising, or any arty businesses.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|You can be angry this version doesn't have 3D or additional features or extras and shout at the studios for exploiting the market. But I wouldn't tell people not to buy it because Avatar is the single best looking Blu Ray currently available. And this is what Cameron said you would be getting from this Blu Ray. Nothing but the movie looking the best it can possibly look because there are no extras. What you are paying for and hopefully gladly is a chance to buy this film for home viewing while it is still in the theaters. And it is spectacular.  You aren't getting the cheap dumbed down product some well intentioned people are warning against. This is a premium quality disc. This is your chance to purchase the theatrical version. Later on you will have the chance to buy the extended edition and a 3D version. Both of these will no doubt cost more than this version.  Not many people will be able to take advantage of 3D so it not being in 3D right now is fairly irrelevant. I love extras. But the truth be told most of the time I only need the movie. The extras all too often go unwatched.     If you want a showpiece Blu Ray to replace or add to your roster of Baraka or Fifth Element or Dark Knight. Avatar will make your HD system sparkle with life you haven't seen to  date.
630469654X|3.0|Watchable film, certainly; but:<br /><br />1.  Make sure you're not getting the fullscreen version, as I inadvertently did.<br /><br />2.  Movie horribly dated by crude 80's-style music.  Alas!<br /><br />3.  Matthew Broderick is loveable but should not have been in this, if you think about it for a second.  His role called for someone who was more wiry and less innocent-faced.

B000NOQDOA|1.0|I was, like everyone else, looking for a headrest mount for my 6 year old's portable DVD player that was NOT a bag with assorted straps and hooks used to provide support for the player. Low and behold, this unit seemed perfect! A semi-permanent mount, and a rigid frame to hold the player securely. WooHoo! But then I read the reviews, and everyone agrees it works great.....but.....the plastic legs are flimsy and are prone to breaking off. But I figure, these other people are clods who can't control their kids. I will be careful and I won't have any problems. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Once you mount it to the headrest posts, it stays there unless you care to mount and unmount each time you think your child might watch a movie. Because it stays there, it is in the way of your child entering and exiting the car 24/7. It is almost impossible to prevent a loose sleeve of a jacket or a swinging leg or arm from catching one of the incredibly flimsy supports and snapping them off! It helps to keep the passenger seat all the way forward, but this is not a solution and often not practical. If you order this, also order a roll of duct tape. You will no doubt need it.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|1- Your Betrayel, this song opens the album with a thunderous drum beat and great first riff.   2- Fever, this song opens with a very fast heavy metal riff a classic BFMV song   3- The Last Fight, The only song off the album to be made int a music video ... so far   4- A Place Where you belong, this song starts with a classical acoustical bullet riff with a bit of screamo at the start.  5- Pleasure and Pain, One of the Heaviest songs on the album .   6- Alone, a great song sounds opens with a riff ,but then goes into a techcnical metal duet riff this is a great song.   7- Breaking out Breaking Down, what a song its my favorite off the album, this song is bullet for my valentine.   8- Bittersweet memories,  the lightest song on the album in terms of screamo and heavy metal guitar riffs   9- Dignity,  a brilliant song   10-Begging for mercy, is definetely the heaviest song on the album.  11-Pretty on the outside, is a brilliant end to this album .         My only problem with this is-  NEW album will be released -FEVER deluxe edition with 5 songs added that will be better than half this release. Not cynical,it's what they've done with every album. I like this one,but am getting tired of 2 versions of every album.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The back of this Blu-Ray box set is stamped 1080i.  Watching the discs in my blu-ray player, the cinematography was still very good, and I remain uncertain if it is actually 1080i or p. However, researching the issue, I've read (on the internet...therefore it MUST be true) that all the boxes on the BBC Blu-Ray series from the UK are stamped 1080i but actually contain 1080p footage of the main program segments.  I've read the reason for the 1080i stamp is that there is some bonus footage that was recorded in 1080i and because this bonus footage is contained within the series, it was not 100% 1080p.  So the BBC opted to place 1080i on the outside of the box.    I'm not certain that is accurate, but based on my view of the picuture, I'm not going to contest it.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Although I own the regular DVD version of Gladiator, I figured I may as well upgrade to Blu-ray since it was on sale. Needless to say, I recommend saving your money and spending it elsewhere. Heck, gambling it away on lottery tickets may garner a more quantifiable return than the visual mess contained on this disc. It seems the technicians went on holiday and left the Blu-ray conversion process to the interns; that, or the studio had a lens filter on loan from Janice Dickenson. Every single prior review is precisely accurate regarding the dismal toll DNR and EE have taken on what could have been a cinematic pleasure. To use an analogy; it's like living in the monkey house. After a while, one becomes acclimated to the terrible smell of dung, to such an extent one no longer notices the pungent odor. Whoever remastered Gladiator to this poor excuse for \\"Blu-ray\\" must have been so accustomed to seeing the same fuzzy and distorted images, they were incapable of realizing what a gratuitous and utterly worthless product they developed.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie has changed my life.  I no longer eat meat, eggs, or dairy products, I read labels, and try to buy only certified organic food.  I show Super Size Me in my high school health classes, Food INC. is the next major film to make the world aware of what we are eating, the major food industries abuse of farmers, workers, animals, and the ultimately the American people. I bought two copies of this film, one for my neighbors, family and friends, and one for myself.  I cannot get those images of penned, caged, and slaughtered animals out of my head, nor the working conditions for the meat industries employees.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|One difference between Band of Brothers and \\"With the Old Breed\\" is that in Band of Brothers at least there is a \\"Band\\" left at the end.  My father was with the First Marines and made it past the first few days on Peleliu.  A major regreet for me was that he never said anything substantial to anyone about the canal, the cape or Peleliu.  He would never volunteer information and for a long time I didn't know enough to ask. By the time I did, that world and time no long existed to him.  Evidently books like Sledge's are the only rare accounts of what happened on the ground. Few people could relate the horror the First marines went through.  I was a corpsman in Nam and realize want words can't relate, but Sledge does an admirable job.
1592332803|5.0|This was my first experience cooking from scratch- all my previous attempts at baking have been made from out of a box.<br /><br />I started with the Bannana Bread, and it came out PERFECTLY. The recipe was easy to follow, especially since it already tells you how much egg replacer to use instead of taking the time to add up how many tablespoons of Ener-G equals one egg.<br /><br />I next made Pumpkin Bread and brought it to a friend's house for a potluck party. Almost everyone there asked me for the recipe because it was so tasty!<br /><br />I made 3 batches of Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip cookies from the book and they were gone within 2 days- WAY better than Uncle Eddies! (which are the best store bought vegan cookies, IMO)<br /><br />The recipes are simple, easy to follow, and come out to perfection. The author explains through out the book different vegan substitues and health benefits of a vegan choice (i.e. soy/almond/rice milk as opposed to cow's milk) and the how to use the different egg substitues (flax/ Ener-G/ bannana, etc.) so you don't use the wrong one and end up with a flat cake or burnt cookies. A great chapter at the front of the book that has helped me measure butter when I had a tub of butter (instead of those sticks of butter with the handy measurement marks on the foil wrapping). And a great appendix in the back which explains the uses for different varieties of apples, the difference between baking soda and baking powder; as well as an index in the back to find recipes according to season, celebrations, and of course alphabetical.<br /><br />I've become enthusiastic about baking and changed many of my omnivorous friend's minds about veganism because of this book!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0000AC8LR|4.0|I'm still debating how I feel about this movie. I know that I'll have to watch it a couple more times to pick up on all the little things and connections. Overall, for now, I appreciate schizo Donnie as the hero - giving his own life for the sake of others - in the end which is really the beginning and the end. Oh, and obviously the guy in the bunny costume, Frank, was really freaking freaky. I'm glad he eventually takes off the suit, though, because that would have given me nightmares if I hadn't known who or what was really inside it. Biggest surprise - seeing Patrick Swayze. I didn't know he was in this movie before I started watching. He was good, and it made me sad seeing him again. Still, I'm glad he's got another good film credit. Yes, I do think this was a good movie, even though I don't fully understand it all yet. I'm still intrigued by the time travel elements. I love time travel in movies and the way it messes with my mind. Oh, and favorite line so far - Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. This movie has some excellent weirdos.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal played Jake Gyllenhaal's sister, and that was neat to see the real-life sibling actors acting together. This was Jake's first major film I believe (not sure), and he was excellent as dark, troubled, sleep-walking schizophrenic Donnie. Jake has continued to get better and better over the years, and, I have to add, hotter and hotter. I patiently await the day he's up for an Oscar.<br /><br />Next time I watch this, I'm sure I'll have more comments.
0307463745|5.0|This was a very quick read. It is apparently a consolidation of their website posts and kind of reads as such in that each section is only a page or two about a particular topic. These topics are sorted into categories and grouped into chapters. (If you are a regular reader of their website than this might not have much of anything new in it for you. I've never read the blog so everything was new to me.)<br /><br />As a whole the book was rather interesting because it was very contrary to most of what you hear or read about what people should do in setting up and growing a company. An example would be that they contend that meetings are evil and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Even then each meeting should have a set agenda with an objective in mind and also have a time limit established that isn't necessarily in the 30 or 60 minute blocks everyone seems to default to. They make the (correct in my opinion) point that meetings waste a ton of time for a company and generally aren't very organized and as such should only be used when needed.<br /><br />A lot of what the authors recommend seems to make perfect sense and it will be interesting to try to implement some of these recommendations at work.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Up in the Air was an instant favorite, and it immediately reminded me of About Schmidt - another movie I really loved which moved to me to tears. Now, Up in the Air is no tear-jerking revelation, but it's still pretty moving and good entertainment.<br /><br />I'd say the romance in this film is more between the main character and his lifestyle, but there is also a short-lived affair for George Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham, with Alex who is played by the lovely, sexy and, at one moment, semi-nude Vera Farmiga. Clooney still looks good and still knows how to trick you into thinking he really is the guy you're watching on the screen. Anna Kendrick was excellent in her role of Natalie. I think she plays the perfect fresh-out-of-college-wants-to-please-everyone-before-herself-hardcore-business-exec-newbie. Her crying scene is hilarious, too, and I especially like the relationship that developed between Kendrick's and Clooney's characters. The thing I like best about this movie is the end; Bingham's last few lines and the way in which they are delivered by Clooney - almost poetic. I also think the title is perfect, and I take it two ways in relation to Clooney's character - He's literally up in the air, and also the things and relationships in his life are how he wants them to be so nothing is really \\"up in the air\\" in those areas. Ryan Bingham has got his certainty, and I think that's nice. There are probably more meanings to that title, and maybe I'm naive in picking up on those obvious ideas, but that's what I gather for now.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT IF YOU CONTINUE READING THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!!!<br />Even though it wouldn't be my career choice, I sort of envy one part of Ryan Bingham's job...the part that includes flying from place to place and never staying put. Of course, after a while that becomes boring and very routine, and I'd want more normalcy on the ground. I think Ryan Bingham's obsession with earning 10-million sky miles and his elite membership card collection sort of pacifies his need for more in a way, and though he eventually does give in to being the guy who does want more of a normal, settled life aka the guy he previously decided not to be, you can somehow predict that he'll return to being that almost non-existent shadow flying overhead. That's where his destiny lies, and, at the end of the film, I was comforted knowing that Bingham was back \\"up in the air\\" and didn't end up miserable and alone. Yes, he is alone, but I think he's happy. He's happier, at least, for having taken a chance and opened himself up to something new, even if it was just for a short time. What's the old saying? Better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all.of pacifies his need for more in a way, and though he eventually does give in to being the guy who does want more of a normal, settled life aka the guy he previously decided not to be, you can somehow predict that he'll return to being that almost non-existent shadow flying overhead.

1419364375|4.0|A few years ago when I had a much longer commute, I listened to lots of audiobooks.  One my favorites was My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult.     Anna, at the age of 13, decides to put a stop to her family using her body as tool to keep her sister alive.  Her sister, Kate, has a rare form of leukemia that has required a variety of tissue donations from her sister, Anna, who was conceived for that purpose.  Now, their mother wants Anna to give Kate one of her kidneys and Anna has had enough.  Anna hires a lawyer and her battle begins.  Picoult tells the story from a variety of the characters' perspectives and the audio recording uses different narrators for each characters' voice.  As the listener you feel like you are listening to each character share their story, the narrators bring the characters to life.  As always, Picoult uses twists and turns to make her readers want more.  Once you've started this novel whether you are reading it or listening to it you will not want to put it down.    Why I was interested: I had read [[ASIN:1416547819 Plain Truth]], also by Jodi Picoult and I wanted to try something else.    Why I finished it:  I was drawn in by the narrators and the story.  I wanted to know what happened to Anna and Kate.    I'd share it with:  Readers who like books that make them think.  Picoult has a way of making you wonder what is really right.  You may start off sympathizing with one character only to discover in the end you feel completely different.  Also, if a reader is a fan of Picoult's this is a must read.    Others books to try: [[ASIN:074349671X The Tenth Circle: A Novel]] by Jodi Picoult and [[ASIN:0446696722 Cage of Stars]] by Jacquelyn Mitchard.

0373774184|4.0|Our romantic couple have a lot going on in their own thoughts. Especially why they should not have a relationship. This Heyer is missing the background of the period.  Venetia is a look at country life, but nowhere near as encompassing as Jane Austen. It is also a reflection on societal mores, again not as well done as Austen who lived during the period,<br /><br />In a Heyer novel we get a consistent universe that is very enriching. Here in Venetia we get a glimpse of that world of Heyers, and just when you are sure that the story has run its course, a plot twist arrives to lengthen it, then a second. Finally in the last twist, we are returned full circle to home. Those twists make something that was not a story, into one.<br /><br />Venetia's plot twists come too late though and makes the last half of the book, which has the best of the action, irrelevant. A story that could have been better with some technical structure.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Received the CD of Queensryche. It was in mint condition. Have been enjoying it since.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|History has a way of satirizing figures of titanic influence.  I would venture to say that, giving the lengthy reign of Victoria and the fact that she is more remembered for her extensive (one might even say excessive) period of mourning for her husband than much else, the same Queen's early years as monarch are generally ignored.  \\"The Young Victoria\\" brings to life a half-decade of the youthful woman's existence who would become one of Great Britain's most powerful rulers.    The Princess was rigorously controlled by her mother, the Duchess of Kent (formerly Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfield) and the Duchess' advisor, Sir John Conroy.  Conroy had absolute power of the Duchess (portrayed with cool remove by Miranda Richardson); it has long been debated whether their relationship was in fact more than platonic.  Conroy was desperate for the underage Princess to submit to a Regency; with the elder Victoria named as co-monarch, Conroy's power would be vast.  Emily Blunt, incidentally, is radiant as the youthful Victoria; she captures the essential blend of the woman's highly emotional nature, sharp powers of observation, intense stubbornness, and keen wit.      King William IV (played with the usual alacrity by the talented Jim Broadbent) realizes he is not long for this world and longs for his reign to extend past his niece's 18th birthday--which it does.  Victoria all but banishes Conroy from court; her mother is relegated to the sidelines as well.  A little-seen figure of British history--Queen Adelaide, William's widow--becomes Victoria's principal female confidante.  Harriet Walter, whose career is peppered with roles in various period piece dramas, brings the dowager queen's materteral concern for her late husband's inexperienced successor to life in the most gentle (yet perspicacious) manner.    Lord Melbourne's role as the heaviest influence, politically speaking, on the new queen is expertly displayed, although I was uncertain how Paul Bettany was selected asthe actor to play the role.  Melbourne was quite older than Mr. Bettany when Victoria ascended; overall, his execution was fine, but I believe an elder statesman among the pantheon of English actors might have lent more credibility to the part.      And the most refulgent performance of all--that of Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the young man whom Victoria would marry--was played to dizzying heights by Rupert Friend.  One was first introduced to this actor in \\"Mrs. Palfrey At the Claremont\\", in which he starred with Joan Plowright.  Friend makes the best of Albert's complex nature:  liberal-minded and open to new ideas in politics and sociology, Albert was keen to apply his high-end aspirations wherever he could.  King Leopold of the Belgians, who was uncle to both Albert and Victoria*, had long orchestrated the two would one day become husband and wife.      * [The film does not make this abundantly clear, but Albert and Victoria were indeed first cousins.  King Leopold, Victoria of Kent, and Albert's father, Ernest III of Coburg, were siblings; this incestuous intermarrying directly led to the hemophilia outbreaks which devastated branches of Victoria and Albert's descendants].     Another reviewer made a critical observation with which I would like to concur:  both Albert and Victoria were devoted to their mutual uncle, as well as Leopold's foremost minister, Baron Stockmar.  The relationship between the King of the Belgians and his respective nephew and niece is, in the movie, at turns hectoring and sullen, whereas history records warm correspondence and memories of mostly happy visits among the intergenerational members of the family Coburg.      Factually, Albert and Victoria defied the odds of arranged royal marriages in that they were deeply in love with one another.  Again, this is evidenced with passionate performences by the two leads.  The film's conclusion has the Queen giving birth to her first child, a third Victoria.    \\"The Young Victoria\\" doesdraw on some historical inaccuracies, which one must find unsurprising.  It defies belief that John Conroy would have dared to become physically violent with the Princess, although the scene depicting as much was indeed dramatic.  One can also be assured the drunken accusatory monologue of King William IV addressed to the Duchess of Kent at the monarch's birthday celebration never transpired.  Finally, while the 1842 assassination attempt on Victoria by John Francis was indeed a true event, Albert was not injured in the slightest.  Still, the fierce reaction on the part of the Queen was likely as impassioned as Ms. Blunt portrayed, whether or not Albert sustained a physical wound.    I was tremendously happy with \\"The Young Victoria\\"--it brings to life the vivacious, mercurial, domineering, and vulnerable woman of few years who had one of the world's greatest kingdom's placed in her hands, and the adoring, intellectually-gifted, strong-willed Prince who would reign at her side.  Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt are gems of shining royal perfection in this wonderfully-executed period piece.

Which is because I bought it at Target store duhhhhh! You all fail for making lame comments to try to fool customers from reading your fake review and stop telling lies! So, get over it!

B0036B8MZU|5.0|I started watching this show from it's premiere, and was anticipating it long before that. When I started watching it, I watched it alone and enjoyed it completely. There was a great mix of sex, violence, and trechery to keep all you senses heightened. After about nine episodes my wife paid attention and was drawn in instanly. We had a two day Spartacus-a-thon, with on demand. After watching she told me that she should start listening to me when I suggest she watch a show with me, she started [[ASIN:B001FB4W16 True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series) [Blu-ray]]] in the second season.<br /><br />This show does use CGI to portray it's scenes of gore and it's backgrounds. This show does have excessive nudity and sex. This show has an excessive use of vulgar language. That is why the show's creators put a written and verbal warning at the beginning of each episode. As the warning states, these elements were added to give an accurate portrayal of what Rome was really like. If you thing things like this didn't happen, you need to open a few history books. I am not saying that this story is a lesson I history, I am just saying that is how life in Rome was.<br /><br />I would love to go in to detail about every episode but I don't want to spoil any of the story. Just know that you care about the main characters. You feel the tension they feel. You feel their desire. You feel their despair. Every actor in the series does an excellent job. My wife and I would watch each episode more than once to absorb everything that happens. I was so impressed with how they chose to wrap the season. It was a very satisfying end, yet it gives you enough to come back for another season. If you have not seen this series definately buy it, but do not be shocked at the content. Every review here, whether good or bad, talks about the content. I know I am putting my preorder right now.

B002YICN74|4.0|First let me say I am NOT a Jonas Brother fan.  I honestly didn't know who they were when I first heard about this album by Nick Jonas.  I am 30 year old married mother of one young son.  I am defintely not the \\"Jonas Brothers\\" demographic.  However, I heard the song \\"Who I Am\\" performed at the Grammy Nominations and I liked it.  I decided to buy the album after it had come out and I was blown away.  I love funk and blues and this was nice mix of both.  My favorite songs are \\"State of Emergency\\" and \\"Rose Garden\\".  But all the songs are very good.  I was shocked to find out that this kid is only 17 years old and recorded this album when he was 16.  He's a gifted storyteller in his lyrics.  I see very amazing things for him in the future.  I think he should distance himself from his brothers and focus on his career as a solo artist.  I know I could be shot for saying that becuase of those rabid JB fans out there, but it is how I feel.  I look forward to hearing more from this young man.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|There is not point in droning on about this movie. The only thing that really needs to be said is that the movie contains some of the best special effects you could ever hope to see in a single movie. So many, in fact, that you will not catch much of the story line. You will be caught by the pretty pictures, and will not have time to really think that the movie line is crazy and very, very stupid. Overall worth a view from redbox, but not really worth buying, unless it is at a pawnshop for a few bucks.
B001FB55L2|4.0|Brothers had the potential to be a great 5 star movie but something lacked that's hard to put a finger on.  There seemed to be holes in the story such as when Cahil (Toby Mcguiire) was presumed dead but was taken as a POW.  There was no story as to how he was captured and what led to his being taken as a prisoner.  The romance between his brother (Jake Gyllenhal) and his wife (Natalie Portman) never really developed into anything but you would think that there was a serious relationship going on at the end.  You may be tempted to repeat the movie to see what you may have missed.  I was a little disappointed in the acting.  There are some top name actors here but there was no stellar performance and the acting seemded a little too scripted, insincere and overaught and just plain lazy as if the actors are just going through the motions - the movie seemed to lack direction.  Natalie Portman, although she is nice to look at was the worst.  She showed absolutely no emotion, said very little and little to no sincerity in the acting.  All in all it is a movie worth watching to judge for yourself but I recommend renting it first.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|I am huge Sade fan, and her latest release is now a coaster on my coffee table.... Sade has made the most depressing album of all time... As she turns 50 one would think she would embrace this new stage of her life with positive, life affirming songs, with rich melodies, real grooves and not drum machines that sound like a death camp march. Not one song is worth anything on this album. Gone are the rich textures, the jazz influence, the hooks/chorus that you keep singing in your head. The only reason this debuted #1 is because everyone, including myself has waited so long for her to come out with a new album.... we all bought it, and proceeded to lay in the bathtub, razor blade in hand wondering what we had just done....... this Album is the worst and it's a shame. Sade ushered all of us into the \\"Smooth Jazz\\" era with Diamond life, and followed that up with gorgeous albums, one after another. We waited ten years for this!!!!!!!!!!! UGH!!!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am an active person. My work out of choice is usually running - so this was different. I wanted to try it because I felt that I would be burning more calories in less time - which would be a more efficient use of my time.     I found the workouts to be intense, and challenging - exactly what I hoped for. I felt that each 20 something minute workout was a good use of my time, and a good kick in the butt. Keep in mind that I am still really only on the first workout. I have watched the 3rd - harder workout and I am excited because it looks even more intense.    As far as weight loss, I haven't been doing it for long enough to comment, but I am sweating a lot and working hard.  I would recommend this workout to anyone who is looking to build strength, challenge themselves and lose some weight.   All you need are some hand weights, enough space to do kicks, lunges and jumping jacks, and maybe a mat if you have hard floors.

B00371QQ2U|1.0|Same problem that everyone else is reporting--without an internet connection, it won't play.  You just get routed back to the same dead-end screen no matter what buttons you push (which teases you by featuring little snippets of the movie in tiny frames, playing in an endless cycle).  Of course, by the time you get that far you've already waited 2-5 minutes for the disc to even load.  I bought one, returned it figuring it was defective, and only learned my lesson after purchasing a second copy (from another store, in another zip code!) which did the exact same thing.  My player is brand new, but it isn't at all convenient to have it connected to the internet.  Very disappointing.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|One of the greatest books ever penned - granted. couple of other version out there...lame. This version, i.e. the 1995 A&E/BBC version...awesome. Could there be a better Liza Bennet? no! could there be a better Mr. Darcy? no! This movie, more than any other attempts, before or since, remained closest the the book and had the most verbatim lines recited.  Then the blu-ray comes out. HUGE difference! it looks and sounds wonderful! (why isn't the 1995 sense and sensibility out in BR?) the only few things that keeps this from being perfect is a) near the end when Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennet are walking and finally 'hook up' as the kids say - the blu-ray goes down to VHS for like three minutes...then the scene ends, and it's back to blu-ray- and B)The features are a little weak...mainly when they talk w/ the cast...they don't get Jennifer or Colin, and we have a 'tour' with 'Mary and Mr.Wickam'. wtf? Otherwise - enjoy!
B00005AG7K|5.0|I'm a big fan of The Beatles so when I saw this it was an instant buy. I read the reviews after ordering and thought I made a bad choice but I actually enjoyed it. The main thing people don't like about this version is because of the bad quality it has. I liked the quality. I found it enjoyable actually. A sort of nostalgia it brought to me to a period I never lived in. Also it gives it that vintage style which is also great. I was dissapointed by the lack of songs though. Where's Strawberry Fields Forever? And I would have enjoyed listening to Hello Goodbye more than just at the credits. Overall it's a great film.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Somewhere between a comedy and a splatterfest, this is a pure zombie acopalypse road trip starring a posse of mismatched characters busy getting on each other's nerves while trying to stay alive. Woody Harrelson is a riot as a white-trash twinkie-loving zombie-hating redneck, and so is Jesse Eisenberg as his absolute opposite, an obsessive wimp who stays alive by making and following rules (which flash onto the screen every so often). Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin show up as a pair of sisters who make life even harder for the two guys, but in the end they all turn out to be one big happy family in the middle of an undead wasteland. Quirky and NOT frightening, just one or two surprises to jump in your seat at. Fair amount of gore, but if you're expecting a traditional horror movie you're gonna be disappointed. I loved the cameo with the well-known uncredited famous comedy star (hint: the initials on the gates at his driveway are \\"BM\\").
1573225517|5.0|You don't have to be a man to understand the feelings (or denial thereof) described in this book.  You don't have to be a man to understand the fear of commitment, the agonizing over relationships, the sometimes hilarious faux-pas incidents, the nerves, the fickleness, the fascination with musical (and other) compatibility; the obsession with lists and music facts.  There are women who too understand the comfort of reorganizing and spending the evening with their record collections, living inside the music.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel (despite my occasional wincing over Rob's overly superficial (and lightning-speed) leaps from girl to girl).     But instead of being angry with Rob for being a \\"typical, immature man\\", unable to \\"sort himself\\" out and thinking only of \\"one thing\\", I found myself incredibly sympathetic; I found myself siding with him in his relationships.  Indeed I found in him someone I could understand.  I could understand his passion for eclectic pop music trivia; his disdain for those with insipid musical taste, his romantic fallings (and failings) based on idealism and unreality... and his just plain fear of dying.  Of living.  But most of all, his fear of growing up.      The novel taught me that we're not so different.  I deeply appreciated this honest, amusing, and touching peek into the other side.  I could relate.    The London setting and sharp wit were plusses.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I have no idea why so many people are hating on this movie.  It's just a movie people!  It's meant for entertainment, it's not supposed to change your life or anything!  And for entertainment purposes, it does a great job.  This movie hits the trifecta of everything I look for in a Blu-Ray....great story, great picture, great sound.  No extras??  Who cares?  Do you seriously buy a movie for the extras?  If so, then you are a joke of a movie fan.  If you are like me and buy the movie for, I don't know, THE MOVIE...then pick this copy up.  I don't care about any \\"Special Editions\\" or \\"Director's Cuts\\" or whatever because I'm not going to buy them anyway.  I wanted the movie and that's exactly what I got.      For those who have compatibility issues with this flick, GET A BETTER BLU-RAY PLAYER YOU CHEAP M'FERS!!!:p
B0036EH40Q|4.0|This movie is a fantastically entertaining flick.  I compare its vibe to \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" as it's a very testosterone-driven movie, filled with some great characters, dialogue and of course, gunfights.  Val Kilmer and Michael Biehn deliver two very memorable movie characters, while Kurt Russell gives one of his best performances.  The rest of the supporting cast is great - Bill Paxton, Sam Elliott, and Powers Booth keep the film grounded when it could've simply become the \\"Kurt and Val Show.\\"  From solid acting, set-pieces, action sequences, and dialogue, this movie delivers.

B00005NGAK|3.0|Of course Michael Flatley is brilliant and there's no debating that.  What I didn't like was the theme throughout this production ie: good spirit vs bad.  Also, there was a departure from traditional Irish dancing and the thing that was most disappointing was all the seduction which didn't have to be.  I thought I could buy this for my parents to watch as they love music and dancing and am now glad I watched it first.  Sorry, not going to agree with the reviews on this.  I prefer what I saw on stage last year 100 times over.  The singing was absolutely beautiful however.
031606792X|3.0|In my GoodReads review of Volume Three, \\"Eclipse,\\" I said the reader deserved some sort of payoff, and Stephenie \\"with an 'e'\\" Meyer did pay out, sort of, by giving readers what they had waded through three volumes of mediocre chest-heaving for. What Meyer should do now is save future readers time and money by distilling the first three volumes into a couple of chapters to be tagged onto the beginning of Volume Four. I was an imbecile for not grasping that what I was reading was a Harlequin romance desperately trying to pass itself off as accomplished young adult fantasy lit. Some folks might laugh, but this was no \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"His Dark Materials,\\" by a long shot! I shouldn't have been surprised that the entire series was a silly titillation, as that's what romance fiction strives so hard to be. I gave this volume three stars because it reminded me of the slippers my grandmother used to knit for all the grandkids: good yarn, but something too easily grown out of.
1594488886|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone who is interested in the war in Afghanistan and wants to understand what its people are up against.  This wonderful novel neither gives nor suggests answers to the problem; it just tells an awful, beautiful story about life in Kabul over the last forty or fifty years.  It is up to the reader to think about the possibilities there.      Another book that might help is Greg Mortenson's Stones Into Schools.  This is a nonfiction book about building schools, especially for girls, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

(Whos native population speak english...of course)  The dialog is right up there with Armageddon and Independence Day, yes...pure genius.     Neon plants, hammerhead rhinos and glowing vines do not a movie make....its a dull story, VERY predictable and cringe worthy.  I mean..\\"Get Some\\" and \\"Take that Bitch\\"..? Really?

B000A2IPP0|5.0|Regarded by many as being one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time, \\"ET\\" will always hold a special place in people's hearts as being a film that deals with the importance of friendship despite the differences between people. The movie is about a young boy who befriends an alien creature known as ET when ET is left behind by his mother spaceship. Steven Speilberg, who directed the movie, based ET on his imaginary friend that he made up in the early sixties when his parents divorced. To Speilberg ET was the brother he never had and the father that he was about to lose. The basis of the story stayed with Speilberg for years, if anything it haunted him, and it wasn't until the early eighties that he was able to get a script written and the project greenlighted by the studio. The movie was filmed in Southern California and most of the cast consisted of young child actors, sometimes an omen for movie makers. However, Speilberg got a taste of working with children after \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", and he has gone on record as saying the \\"ET\\" shoot was one of his most memorable due to his working with Drew Barrymore, Henry Thomas, and other kids.<br /> A film that never ages, \\"ET\\" has consistently shown up on \\"best movie lists\\" time and time again, with \\"Time\\" writing that \\"ET\\" is one of the best motion pictures ever.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses including interviews with those who worked on the film (now grown adults) as well as Speilberg, commentary, trailers, and more. As of 2010 \\"ET\\" has grossed nearly $800,000,000 making it one of this biggest blockbusters in movie history. The budget of the film was moderately low, at $10,000,000.

He's sent to the home of Ms. Deverill, a sinister old lady with whom Matt instantly distrusts. Matt soon discovers that there's something sinister going on, & that if he's not careful he will end up as one of the latest casualties in the town of Lesser Malling.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this book, although there was one thing that sort of bugged me. It's nothing major, but if you are curious then I'll elaborate more in the comments section. (The gripe is sort of spoilerish.) The book wasn't as well fleshed out as I'd like, but then this is only the first volume in the series. I can't expect all of the secrets to be revealed in the first book, now can I?<br /><br />The only thing I'd warn parents about is that there's a lot of violence in the book, with one character dying graphically in the course of the book. Since each parent is different when it comes to this sort of thing, I recommend that the parents read the book first & then discuss the content with their child after they've finished reading it. The book is quite good, so the parents shouldn't have any problem reading it. (Plus it's a great way to connect with your kid!)<br /><br />I can't wait to read the rest of the series- this shows a lot of promise!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. You don't break box office and blu-ray sales records by being a terrible movie. The people who rated this one star are idiots and don't have a taste for movies. There is more to a movie than the story (which I still think is brilliant). If you don't like it, at least appreciate the other things it did well. The cinematography and CGI are from another planet (no pun intended). I just wish people wouldn't be so ignorant...

0810983915|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days is all about how Greg will spend his summer.  His idea of a good summer vacation is being indoors playing video games while his parents want him to have outdoor family time.  Jeff Kinney does an excellent job showing the inner thoughts of a young boy while sticking to good, clean humor.  My children both loved the story as did my nephew and niece who are 13 and 14 years old.  The whole series is wonderful entertainment for our kids.  The book is a must read for this summer or during the school year when you are dreaming of what you will do over your next summer vacation.    By Kerri J. Busteed  Author of Will's First Hunt
055358894X|5.0|I read The Lies of Locke Lamora knowing almost nothing about it when I began.  A friend had recommended it some time before, and I started on a whim, and then couldn't put the book down.  Locke is a charming, multi-layered protagonist inhabiting a vivid and unique setting.  Even the more minor characters are fleshed out, and the detail Lynch has put into the world is enchanting without being distracting.  The plot, much like the hero, employs many tricks and turns, but remains so charming that you don't care if it's conning you, so long as you get to enjoy more time in Locke's company.  It's a book you don't want to end, and can't wait to reread.
0810993139|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid was an instant sensation at our house and our school.  Greg is the wimpy kid in all of us.  He is the one everyone likes to pick on.  The one that never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries.  Greg tells the story through his journaling and drawings in cartoon style.  The novel appeals to kids of all ages with its short stories and the funny way he describes his day to day happenings. He is starting middle school this year and his mom thinks keeping a diary will be a good way for him to write down his feelings.  He agrees as long as it is a journal and not trully a diary.  Mom screwed up and bought a journal with the word DIARY on the cover.  This is where it all starts to go wrong or is it right?    Jeff Kinney tells the tale that we have heard from post middle school children time and time again, but in a great new way.  The journal style writing and cartoon pictures keeps you turning the pages to see what will happen to him next.  I recommend starting with Diary of a Wimpy Kid and continuing on through the series.  Read it alone or with one of your children.  Either way it is sure to be an instant hit for all.    By Kerri J. Busteed  Author of Will's First Hunt   [[ASIN:1609114833 Will's First Hunt]]

159448385X|4.0|In keeping with the true meaning of women's fiction, A Thousand Splendid Suns was selected and read by Women Fiction Club members because it actually fits the genre. This title 1) focuses on a woman (in this case women),  2) the women learn, change and grow because of a journey detailed within the pages of the book and 3) the book has a satisfying but not necessarily tidy and happy ending. There may also be added benefit for readers of this book. When following Miriam and Laila, the two heroines in the novel, readers may discover that they have also learned, changed and grown in knowledge and perspective by the end of this book.      The setting for the book is Afghanistan from around 1959 to April 2003. The very volatile happenings in the country are such an intricate part of the book that they heavily influence each character's personality in ways not easily imagined. Those who are not familiar with Afghanistan's past may be intrigued enough to do their own historical research for a better understanding and clarification. It would be an interesting side project, especially for book club discussions, but it's certainly not necessary to enjoy the book or respond to its characters.     Miriam, the illegitimate daughter of a very rich married man, lives in exile with her mother Nana, who is a very bitter, unhappy and angry woman. Nana teeters between blaming her predicament on Jalil, the man who fathered her child and Miriam, the child born from their illicit affair. Although Jalil already has three wives and multiple children, Miriam and her mother are an embarrassment for the family. Not only is Miriam a harami (bastard) but her mother worked as a maid in Jalil's home when she became pregnant. The book gives life to Miriam's story of her solitary upbringing until age fifteen when she is married off under stressful circumstances to Rasheed, a man well into his forties.     Laila, is born years after Miriam's marriage takes place. The contrast between the two women ismore than the generation that separates them. Their childhood beginnings have stark differences which have molded their personalities and outlooks. Laila has had valuable relationships with her parents, friends and the community which allows her to blossom into a very proud and independent teenager. However, Laila, at age fourteen, also marries Rasheed. Like Miriam, the circumstances surrounding the marriage are very difficult and Laila feels as if she has no choice.     The two women, who come from very different experiences, have nothing in common but the one man that they both married. Once neighbors, Miriam and Laila must share a life together under the same roof with the same abusive husband. In their roles as wives they start out as adversaries but eventually they create an important bond. They discover that the difficulties they endure living under the Taliban's rule and in the midst of war is about more than learning how to be family or friends - it's about how to survive.    The general consensus from The Women's Fiction Club members is that this book is a WFC favorite!

1439148953|5.0|This is not a travel book.  Indeed, the title is deceptive despite the fact that much of the story takes place there.  Rather, it is a beautifully written,gentle tale of a young woman's journey from one country to another, from one culture to another, from adolescence to adulthood.  I loved the book and will certainly look for other works by Mr. Toibin.
B001TKKAUK|5.0|An excellent live CD from a rock legend who doesn't always get his due.  A great collection of his Beatles hits, his early solo hits, and some of his newest material. His tribute to the recently departed George Harrison is especially moving. I agree with the previous reviewer, this band is much tighter than the groups he puts together for his All-Starr band tours. The quality of the sound onstage and the resulting recording are outstanding. Most of all, what comes through on this CD, and if you are ever fortunate enough to catch him on tour, is that Ringo is enjoying every moment of the show and really does have alot of love and respect for his audience.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|I love this movie. It makes you feel good about happy endings and love conquers all. Loved the actors and and the screenplay. Matthew MacFadyen was a perfect Darcy. Tall, dark and handsome. Keira Knightley is always beautiful. I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn. They are fantastic as usual. Darcy is so difficult at the beginning that it was great watching him falling for her and how he made such a mess when he proposed. It was difficult to see him say all the wrong things and not be aware he was so insulting. Great ending.
B0039OGGVQ|2.0|This album would normally deserve more than 2 stars, if it were done by some other band/musician. Slash set some very high standards though with AFD and, yes, UYI, and everything he does is measured against those. By those standards, this album can't possible deserve more than 2 stars.    I'm a big fan of everything Slash has done, from AFD through the Snakepit and to VR. I love it all. This one though is a huge disappointment. The material isn't bad, but it's just generic. The only tune that stands out (IMO) is the one with Lemmy. The rest don't suck, but they are easily forgettable.     I admire a lot Slash's talent for good riffs and melodic solos. (Not to mention the tone of #36 on AFD). This album has some cool guitar lines, but they get lost in the overall blandness of the songs.    All in all, if you're familiar with all of Slash's previous work you'll be most likely mightily unimpressed with this one. Slash still has \\"it\\", he hasn't lost his mojo, but apparently he needed to output some of his high energy on a project like this one.    Slash should stop waiting for the perfect singer, get a decent singer, get together with VR and make some nasty, typical Slash noise. I never understood why he dumped Josh Todd. I don't know if Todd was the perfect singer, but he sure is a good singer, with the right energy and attitude for VR. I believe an album with Todd would have been much better than this one. Anyway...that's pointless, just me venting... I look forward to Slash's next album.

B0035G1K7S|5.0|If you love the White Stripes you will love this movie, everything that's awesome about the band is on this disk, the spontaneity and passion of their shows, the power of their music, Jacks interesting views on life and music, subtle pre meditated comical things like the placement of background objects.  I really enjoyed watching it. It beautifully captures what their live shows are all about. Someone who doesn't get them and what they are all about could argue that they sound a little sloppy in places or his voice is occasionally off, she's not a great drummer Etc but if you get what they are all about all of those things just add to how awesome they are and why their live shows are so passionate and amazing to watch. In summary if you love them you will love this, if you love music and passionate performances, you will love this, if you're a Jack White hater who doesn't get the white stripes or what they are about, look elsewhere, this movie will not be good for you.
0307269981|5.0|I'm not much for spoilers, but this book fully lives up to the first, if not beyond.

B0036EH40Q|1.0|Wow, Blu-Ray just isn't all it's purported to be. Tell me why, a disc that is supposed to able to hold 6X the information than a standard DVD is merely used to hold the bare minimum for a film. Oh I know, the movie studios want to gouge you for all the money they can. Notice this BR is NOT the Director's Edition of the film. So some day in the future, they'll release it again and expect you to buy it in it's Director's version. Um no. I think I'll keep the Vista Series Director's Cut and skip this.<br /><br />Also, have you noticed that Amazon, rather than have a clear and empty comment section for this version of the film, continue to post the comments from the various prior editions. They need to fix this.
B002VECM6S|5.0|What a fantastic screenplay of yet another true story. Fiction could not fare better. Ever notice how true examples of love, honor, trust (with a little faith mixed in) always seem to establish an everlasting place in the annuls of movie history? Seemingly destined to sometimes become known as a \\"classic\\"?<br /><br />This could possibly BE one of those films in time.<br /><br />Under precarious circumstances, a family invites an intelligent, athletically talented black teenager into their home, then progressively into each others' hearts as they learn and grow together, culminating a grandiose finale.<br /><br />Acadamy Award winner Sandra Bullock's portrayal of an upper-class white female in the South is immaculate. The entire supporting cast is performance-worthy as well. Though sports is an important concept in the film, this movie is more about the inner qualities that reside in all of us... as people... to make proper decisions and help others that need it most.<br /><br />THE BLIND SIDE incorporates all the variables of great movie-making art: drama, humor, action, and sentimentality. (Beware, macho guys... this movie may even bring a tear to YOUR rugged eye). A great cinematic achievement that can be viewed and enjoyed by anyone... with anyone, at any time, again and again.<br /><br />A sensitive, uplifting and thought-provoking movie awaits you. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!

630197767X|4.0|Rocky, 1976 film    The film begins at a small prize fight. \\"Hit `em\\" yells a viewer. [A catharsis for the audience?] The last man standing wins. The boxers get their pay. Rocky works as a debt collector for a bookmaker. [The prices date this story.] Is it time to retire? We see Rocky's life in the poor part of town. \\"Stay in school and use your brain.\\" Rocky gives advice to a young miss. Its important to pick your friends. The planned Big Boxing Event has a problem. Apollo Creed needs an opponent in a hurry. [A dying sport?] They will pick someone from Philadelphia. The show must go on! Does Pauly need better manners? [Unreal?] They go to an ice rink on Thanksgiving night, then talk. [We know what the future is for Adrienne.] Rocky doesn't need a telephone. Will they grow closer?    \\"It's a wasted life.\\" Rocky expects work as a sparring partner, not a title bout. [To fix the fight?] \\"Everybody has a chance to win.\\" Rocky needs a manager to help him. His breakfast is raw eggs. Running to build wind and stamina. \\"Are you doing my sister?\\" Punching raw beef? [No animal cruelty here.] Rocky wants to stay strong. He practices in the gym. Will he weaken his legs? Apollo talks about business while Rocky pounds raw meat. There is conflict at Pauly's home. Rocky trains and trains, getting stronger now. But he has some doubts. And so the fight begins. Is Rocky outclassed? There is a surprise! Apollo shows his skills. Rocky is pummeled but continues. What is holding him up? Rocky lasts the 15 rounds. Adrienne greets his. Apollo remains the champ on points.    The story how an unknown actor wrote a movie plot, obtained funding, and made a hit movie is amazing. This is still a good movie, but I noticed its economy in production. This story about a rags-to-riches success will always resonate with an audience. Did it give hope to an America that suffered from escalating gas prices and a devalued dollar? This movie made a star out of Sylvester Stallone. Some say \\"The Italian Stallion\\" is a reference to an earlier movie by this actor.

B002ZCDR88|1.0|Leave Your Sleep is a long winded collection of poems set to music that would have been better set on fire.  Aside from the atrocious sound of her voice, which I used to adore, there is not a single song in all 26 on this album that I would ever listen to again or recommend to anyone.  For me, this album is absolutely devoid of soul and any of the character that has made Natalie Merchant's music so completely enthralling.  The songs on Leave Your Sleep are just flat out bad.  No amount of packaging or individual musicians working on this concept have been able to make it any other than one of the biggest musical disappointments in recent history, especially when you consider the source.  Leave Your Sleep left me bored and numb, and quite frankly, agitated with its own pretentiousness.  Hopefully, Leave Your Sleep is just a HUGE snafu in an otherwise stellar career.
0393324818|5.0|Lewis does a fantastic job at writing about objective sports management theory.  Although the book focuses on baseball, the principles he writes about can actually be applied to any type of management.  Lewis also is great at taking a potentially boring topic (general management of a professional baseball team) and making it very interesting.    The only inappropriateness of this book for anyone would be the language.  There are multiple uses of the \\"F\\" word, and other various swear words.  Overall though, it's not over the top and it is always used in quotes.

1597801585|4.0|The good news / bad news about The Windup Girl is that it's a complete universe, with a long back history which is only partial explained, only hinted at.  Its strength is its strong characters and complex back story, its weakness is that they keep dipping their toes into this river of history and yet you don't understand everything that happened to the characters in the past.  You get the sense that the author's invested in this alternate history and will (if he hasn't already) produced a series of novels in this path.      That said, it's a great book, a good story with surprises and many people to root for on opposite sides of the story.  The character behave very believably, the back history and science are reasonable which is not often true of sci-fi.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I can't say that I've ever actually read the Sherlock Holmes books. I do remember seeing the old black and white films though. I found them to be somewhat flat and rather Clue-ish... but done in all seriousness, which rather robbed them of impact or suspense. So it's safe to say that my first experience with the Holmes mythos starts with the Guy Ritchie film.    With regards to plot intrigues, this film is rather thin on them. A sharp observer can get the gist of it within the first fifteen minutes or so. In addition, I felt that the whole supernatural aspect of the plot device rather silly and slightly dull.    However, as I continued watching the film, it became more and more clear that the case that Holmes and Watson were attempting to solve was more a side note to the real plot of the movie: Holmes dealing with Watson getting engaged and moving out. Indeed, the character byplay between them made me forget entirely that this movie was \\"supposed\\" to be about solving a case, it was that much fun. For that matter, the sound editing fully backs it up as a character story. There are points where the sound becomes as one character would hear it, lending an almost first person feel to some of the scenes, even though they were not shot that way.    Anyway, I thought that the acting was excellent and splendidly entertaining. I could not get enough of Watson and Holmes sniping at each other. Fans of the older Holmes movies might disagree with Watson's portrayal, as Jude law is neither short or rotund, but I found that it worked for this movie extremely well and made it more of an equal partnership between the two men. The little hyper-analytical segments before Holmes smacks someone around managed to speak volumes about him in a very small space of time and his pervasive social ineptness made him into a more believable character. The female characters weren't all that bad either, with Mary providing a quiet foil to Irene's outspokenness, but both having a great deal of capability in totally different arenas.    All in all, I found this to be less of a detective mystery type story and much more of an action adventure with awesome characters. Again, I have no idea how close to the books this film is, but rest assured, I will be finding out. In any case, I will probably continue to enjoy the movie regardless.
B00005S6K8|5.0|It is not often that a remake of a movie is an improvement over the original but this movie pulls it off with ease! As fond as we are of Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and William Holden, the performances by Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, Greg Kinnear, and Nancy Marchand work together to produce a delightful gem of a movie.<br /><br />This is one we watch on a regular basis and find each time that we are again delighted by the entire feeling of this movie; the acting, the scenery, and the dialog all work together to produce a captivating experience. All of the supporting roles are well cast and convincing.<br /><br />I can recommend this movie enthusiastically!
B002VPE1AW|2.0|Well, everyone else has weighed in on Avatar, I suppose I should too.    I might as well get the obvious out of the way first. Visually it is very well done. Granted you could get the same thing by watching a cut scene in a modern video game these days, but no one really plays those for plot now do they? I had utterly no desire to see this in 3D. From what I could tell, that was more of a marketing gimmick than anything else. When they come out with a psychological suspense/thriller in 3D, then I will spring the extra 4 bucks for it. Untill then... I'll pass on action flicks in 3D.    Plotwise... oh dear, where to begin?    With regards to the story, this movie needed a huge injection of background material. Jake, the main character, is paraplegic from serving in some war or other (it's never explained). The corporate and military antagonists are hunting for some rare mineral, but the audience is never told what it does or why it's important and worth so much to the Terrans. In the absence of such background set up, the conflict between the Terrans and the native Navi of Pandora seems overly simplistic. It's a shame because I would have liked to see more complex villains to go with the pretty visuals.    For the main good guys, if you like anti-colonialism stories, or conservation minded stories, you will probably like them well enough. It's just that in more than a few places, the \\"OMG pretty pictures!\\" seemed to take priority over story elements. That and the romance part of the tale was faceplamingly predictable. I was okay with and liked most of the protagonists overall, although I kind of wished that more of Jake's interaction with his human cohorts had been expanded upon. I wonder if he started to withdraw from them while getting to know the Navi.    It is rather like Dances with Wolves... but with a double shot of Zulu to go with it. It kind of makes me wish that they had opted to adapt Anne McCaffery's Decision at Doona instead (it also has cat people aliensin it). I do like that this proves that an \\"original\\" science fiction story can make scads of money and that it further demonstrates digital costuming is a viable way of making non-human characters seem real on the screen. I just wish there had been better storytelling to go with it.
B001HN69B8|3.0|As you probably can tell, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is one odd movie. I think it's worth checking out, but I'm not yet sold on it. The plot is essentially a fairy tale of a man who made a bet with the devil He and his traveling troupe possess a mirror into a bizarre world in which people are forced to make a choice between good and evil.     Visually, the film is stunning. It contrasts the drab reality with the vivid colors of the mirror world. The movie also does keep you engaged because it is so different it's tough to predict what will happen.     The plot has obvious religious and philosophical overtones which at times are interesting. However, sometimes the plot becomes so odd and convoluted that it's tough to follow. Viewers are just asked to accept crazy notions such as a hidden mirror world and drastic personality changes. Unfortunately, the first half of the film starts off clear enough, but it seems like it just twists itself into knots by the end. I still don't quite get why certain characters did certain things at the end (which I won't discuss for fear of revealing spoils).     The acting overall was good, not great. Chris Plummer and Lily Cole were particularly good. Sometimes it seemed a bit forced though. I particularly didn't like the actor who played Satan (Tom Waits), who comes across as a bored salesman.     Overall worth checking out if you like different movies, but not great.
B001CO42MU|4.0|Fabulously acted and completely worth the time and money.  I loved this movie.  It's a little like the book \\"Lolita\\" though - you have to pay attention to realize quite how awful Jung is and infer the countless lives he has ended and ruined because of his \\"WTF\\" attitude to making more money than he (literally) knows what to do with.  All the actors are superb, and I was riveted throughout.  I will now go an read the book that it was based on.<br /><br />Warning - spoilers follow about some of the history, though I don't think it will affect your enjoyment.<br /><br />Jung comes across as a very likeable guy, and according to the real George Jung in the commentary Depp nails his portrayal to an almost scary degree.  What is also horrifying in the extras is how the director's genuine liking for the real George Jung seems to have completely removed his compassion for George's victims.  A 25 minute long, subtitled, tame, and somewhat confused documentary on the Colombian drug story does little to redress the balance.  On the commentary Jung manages to contradict and indict himself all in about 30 seconds when he actually blames the *parents* of the kids doing drugs, rather than his committed partnership with Escobar to \\"invent\\" cocaine for the US.  Comparisons with \\"Scarface\\" are inevitable and though most of the story is different, the understanding that there really are people out there like this, that they are not *too* different from the rest of us, but they have something very important that is missing, broken, or deeply corrupted is very valuable.
0679745203|5.0|It's too bad they make movies out of all the best books because they never do them justice. My other favorite authors are Annie Proulx, Anais Nin and Don Dellilo. If you like their writing styles and sensibilities then you'll love this book!
0061922315|5.0|The loss of a child takes varied forms, but each is a cause of unspeakable grief and heartache.  The Secret Daughter enlightens us about a place and a culture that might be unfamiliar to some readers, but the essence of the story is that loss, whether it comes as a result of miscarriage, sacrifice, or life decisions.  But I was not left with a sense of hopelessness, rather just the opposite.  The author handles all this with great skill and a style that kept me involved with the characters and their story to the very end.<br />I encourage anyone who likes engaging fiction with a chance to learn something about India and its culture to read this one: it will stay with you long after you finish the last page.
0307454541|4.0|I was hooked. Slightly disturbing at times but a great read. The first movie is wonderful. Too bad Hollywood is taking over and will inevitably mess it up.
0156034026|1.0|If I could have given this book zero stars, I would have.<br />For one thing, I went to the trouble of finishing reading the story.  I only wish the author could have bothered to finish writing it.<br />The style is awkward - one continuous monologue. The voice of the speaker is annoyingly self-satisfied. The plot is ... Oh, wait ... there is no plot.<br />The main character drones on and on about his shallow empty life in pursuit of money and a beautiful blonde, and then decides he no longer wants to pursue money, and the beautiful blonde, then eventually ... well, who cares? I didn't. You really don't need to read this book.<br /><br />Maybe you can spend your money on A Mighty Heart, by Mariane Pearl, if you want actual insight into Pakistan and Islamic fundamentalism.
0805087184|3.0|This book features large colorful pictures that are almost abstract in appearance. It is a bit short but a classic just the same. Great for teaching basic colors, and animals. I must admit it was not one of our personal favorites and had too little interest to be read by us over and over. My son did enjoy it, but did not request a re-read. It would be very useful for small children as one of their first books. It was visually interesting.

0307716988|5.0|I checked out Moonwalk from the library about 5 or 6 years ago, but never got around to reading it. The book didn't cross my mind again until a few months after it's reprinting last October. Let it be clear that this is far from a tell all. MJ does touch on the strained relationship with his father and the fact that he punished the kids with many a beating growing up. He never uses the word \\"abuse\\", but it's obvious that's what it was and he would admit it in several interviews afterward. He also opens up about his chronic loneliness and vilification by the media. You come to realize just how tortured and isolated he was. Yes, he had his quirks, but he seemed like a sweet manchild that only wanted to be loved and understood. On the lighter side, he shares his love of performing and other artists who were major influences on him (it was sweet of him to speak kindly of Diana Ross's performance in The Wiz since alot of people trashed her). Not to mention the iconic debut of his signature moonwalk on the Motown 25 special. If you're looking for a glimpse into the many times chaotic yet larger than life world of the King of Pop, pick it up.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I pre-ordered this Blu-Ray and was disappointed with the complete lack of any features.  The movie might be decent, but I feel quite abused by the studio.      I was also annoyed by the on-screen display during pausing or forwarding or rewinding and the difficulty in figuring out Which of the three options was actually highlighted due to poor color choice.    I was quite surprised to see a strange error come-up while navigating to the main menu the first time I attempted to view the movie in my PS3.    I don't know who did the final Quality Assurance on this presentation, but it is not very well though-out.  I don't understand why all the other reviewers rated this BluRay so high unless they just liked the sound and the picture quality (which are both quite good).    I guess I could most closely describe this as if I had bought a book that had a terrific story but all the pages fell out after I read it once.
089381525X|3.0|I doubted between buying a new or a used book. I took a new one but regret it. Because the packaging is quite poor the corners of the book are slightly damaged and hence the boog is not anymore in mint condition. Used would be better.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|Yes these guys sound a lot like AC/DC. Let's get that out of the way. My response to that... who cares? This band owns and if they sound like aca daca so what? Great hard rock songs, not a bad song on either their first or second cd and they destroy live. Give 'em a shot. These aren't wanna be's but the real deal. I only hope they get a little more \\"metal\\" as time goes on. Right now though they are a hard rockin' Aussie monster of a band and if they pick up right where AC/DC leaves off? Well, AC/DC could do a lot worse...
B0029358GM|3.0|Without a doubt the most unlistenable Wilco album ever. Eminently forgettable tunes flow like water down a river of insomnia. If this is Americana maturing, I'll pass. Wilco the album, is Wilco the flop.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|Very good cd. Classic feel and sound of 80's Scorpions. They definitely do themselves justice here.
0671449028|5.0|First off, I love Sandra Boynton board books!  I have a lot of them and this one is one of my favorites.  My 20 month old went through a period of not wanting to read any books, but about 2 months ago she started letting us read to her before she went to bed.  I started reading this book to her and now it is our nightly tradition.  She always reaches for it, grabs her blanket, jumps on my lap and is read for the story.  Eventhough it is short (as all of them are) it is enough that it keeps her attention.  She loves helping to turn the pages and when certain pages come up, she gets this look of excitment on her face.  Highly recommended!
B00371QQ0M|5.0|While everyone else has been waiting for AVATAR or LOTR (and yes I bought both of those and LOVE them), I've been holding my breath to watch DUNE in all its highdef glory. After watching this bluray disc, I feel like I've seen half of the film in HD and the other half in fair quality SD. I THINK I know what I'm talking about here . . . I saw this film 3 times in the original theatrical run, then bought the video tape in the Beta format, shortly thereafter replacing it with my first VHS copy of the film. Next came the LaserDisc (sadly a pan and scan version) then another vhs (from TV) of the \\"extended version\\". Shortly before the death of VHS, Universal released a Widescreen VHS version and then came the first, non-anamorphic DVD. Most recent is the steelbook anamorphic DVD release that also included the extended version as well as deleted scenes and short documentary materials. I still own them all and I'm happy to say that this new bluray release is the best DUNE has ever looked in a home video format . . . but I expected way more.     The GOOD STUFF: Many scenes have a great deal of the HD pop, and as soon as Princess Irulan begins her opening monolog the difference in PQ from previous releases is apparent. Things stay looking pretty good until we get to Geidi Prime (Home of House Harkonnen) and then things look SPECTACULAR. After hundred of viewings of this film, I noticed details I had not seen before! There are MANY impressive looking scenes in this new edition and the all important \\"water of life\\" sequence and the final battle and the end scene in the Hall of Rites all look stunning and nearly three dimensional. They are gorgeous.     THE BAD STUFF: Dirt, specks, lines, threads, all sorts of debris on the print show up FREQUENTLY and they ARE distracting. There is also significant fade damage on the right side of the print in several of the \\"Paul meets the fremen\\" sequences and the \\"Paul trains the fremen and blows up a big pyramid\\" sequences. This damage hasbeen apparent on EVERY widescreen edition of the film Universal has put out and while it does look a little better on this edition (as if they tried to do something about it) it is still there. Certainly all of the specks and dirt (some small, others the size of footballs) could have been removed through digital means but Universal didn't bother with it. Black levels are not the best either and skin tones are all over the place, with the Baraon appearing very pink in every scene while Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is consistently yellow. There is some noticeable grain at times but I can put up with that. It is the frequent dirt and debris I object to.     The DTS-HD sound is pretty good for the most part and there was a lot of great wind blowing from my rear speakers during the majestic opening title music. The roar of the worms gave my subwoofer a good pounding as did the scene where Paul plants the thumper but often the sound was a bit harsh and unconvincing. I suspect this is the fault of the original source and I suspect Universal has done the best they could with this soundtrack.     THE EXTRAS: LESS than what was included in the 2005 DVD release! Most importantly the extended version (flawed though it is) is not included here. I guess they know DUNE fans will double dip when they re-release this disc with that version. Also not included is the beautiful photo gallery. The theatrical trailer is nowhere to be found here either and none of the printed material from either the DVD original release or the booklet from the 2005 release is included. There is however plenty of advertisement from the UNIVERSAL BD LIVE TICKER trying to sell you stuff (it has to be manually turned off every time). If you turn this feature off, which plays OVER THE (ugly and generic) MAIN MENU, you will be treated to the message that you can no longer access their wonderful BD LIVE features (which consist of absolutely NOTHING but advertisements) because you are not connected to theinternet! The rest of the extra material from the 2005 release is presented here in \\"fullscreen\\" format in SD, so all of the cool deleted scenes will be window boxed. The disc was also rather slow and clunky to load taking a full three minutes to get to the feature film.    The entire presentation of this release seems very half-hearted to me. I DO like the cover art (the same from the 2005 release) and at least the keepcase isn't one of those garbage eco cases. The disc itself looks entirely generic with no artwork whatsoever. Maybe I am expecting too much for an older catalog title but I've seen so many even older titles look so much better on blu ray than this thing does.      Universal seems to have spent far more time finding ways to advertise itself and the bluray format than bothering with the release of a top notch catalog title. Come on, if they are going to tell me on the front cover and the back cover that I am buying a PERFECT picture, then at least don't sell me something that has this many imperfections all over it. I have actually seen a few bluray discs that I thought lived up to their \\"perfect\\" hype but this disc isn't one of them. Not by a long shot.
067144901X|5.0|I love this Sandra Boynton book!  I bought it for my daughter when she was a little over 1 and it was one of the only books that I could read to her.  She loves all the animal noises and has gotten really good at matching the sound to the animal.  Should would listen to it over and over.  It was great for the airplane! When she finally figured out how to say the animals noises, she gets so excited everytime! A priceless book that all babies should have!
1439148953|2.0|After WWII, a young Irish woman named Eilis comes to America and settles in Brooklyn, where she works in a clothing store and goes to night school.<br /><br />If you think that was a generic synopsis, wait till you read this book.  It's nothing but generic sentences lumped into non-descript paragraphs.  There is very little 'in the moment' action and every page reads like a summary (\\"She went to work and then came home,\\" etc.)  Nothing much happens until the last 30 pages.<br /><br />There is neither action, drama, nor antagonist and I would hardly call Eilis a heroine; she's meek and mousy, says yes to everything, and is so stoic she lacks personality. Reading this book was like looking at a painting through gauze; it was okay but lacked enough detail to make me really like it.
B002SF9YUM|3.0|Being a Dali freak, I looked forward to seeing this film.  Although some scenes were well-acted and/or visually beautiful, the story really never got itself together.  In the end, the viewer never gains any insight into Dali, Garcia Lorca, or the time period in which the film was set.  Robert Pattinson does not do very well in depicting Dali; he alternates between acting as if he were in a trance and letting his eyes bug out in an attempt to capture Dali's personality.  It's a tough part, admittedly, but he does nothing to show us the man behind the reputation.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Perhaps the best of the trilogy!!! Well written, especially for a translation. The names of places and characters is/are a bit difficult to follow as the setting is Sweden with its unfamiliarty for Americans. Good complexity with a Hitchcokian ending. Would make an excellent movie.

073935650X|5.0|This is an amazing book. I'd been disappointed that I hadn't come across anything this year that really wowed me.  That isn't true any longer.<br /><br />I found the framework of the book quite creative- a teenage boy listening to a series of audiotapes left by a female friend that committed suicide. She tells her story, and asks that the tapes be passed along to all those that played a role in what lead up to her decision.<br /><br />Hannah's story was sad, her reaction to it even more so. She describes a series of events. Each, taken on it's own, was something she could deal with. Added together, she felt cut off from any hope or connection in her life.<br /><br />Clay is a genuinely good guy. Not perfect, but overall, a good guy. As he listens, and puts together the pieces, he is horrified by the effects of seemingly small actions by his peers, as well as some truly horrible larger actions. He struggles with his roll, as he only wanted to get to know her, to possibly be more than friends.<br /><br />I thought that the book showed the impact that even small actions can have. I really felt for both Hannah and Clay. Talking to others, I've heard split opinions- some found it as compelling as I did. Others did not. Beyond the obvious fact that not everyone perceives each book the same, I have two thoughts.<br /><br />First, it's quite true that not everyone would take the same path as Hannah, given these events. If you are a person that doesn't have a tendency to depression, who would be able to pull yourself through these events (or believe you would), the story may not resonate.<br /><br />Second, I really think the audio production added to my appreciation. There were separate narrators for Clay's narration and Hannah's tapes, and both were excellent. The audio production is incredible, and if you are considering listening to this book, I'd strongly recommend it.<br /><br />I would suggest a private spot for reading it, particularly the second half. I rarely react outwardly to books, but I think I may have started some gossip about myself at my daughter's school, because this book had me in tears.gossip about myself at my daughter's school, because this book had me in tears.
B003G8WI7G|5.0|I really, really hope that this cat goes far in his career and that a lot of people get turned on to his music. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to hear this kind of music coming out right now!    I saw him about a month or so before this release at Mountain Stage in Charleston, WV. The whole room immediately came alive (which is really rare at Mountain Stage because it's a NPR radio show) and it was just incredible. I went straight home and searched for him all over the internet. Now the album is out on a national label and I just hope that it gets the recognition and appreciation it deserves.    The phrase \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" definitely doesn't apply to this guy. He is certainly a jack of all trades, but he can actually master each of them. I just finished my fourth listen through this album and absolutely love it.    Shorty is very diverse but each track is anchored in the original, horn-heavy, and upbeat style of New Orleans jazz. Tracks like \\"Suburbia\\" sound like straight-up rock in the vein of Metallica or Pearl Jam but somehow his horns sound right at home among the electric guitar riffs and his use of brass provides a sound and a feel that would otherwise seem out of place in that kind of rock. Some of the tracks like \\"Something Beautiful\\" and \\"On Your Way Down\\" have beats behind them that are very reminiscent of old-school hip-hop and modern R&B. Some songs like \\"Quiet as Kept\\" sound like straight-up funk with Shorty weaving in and out seamlessly while \\"In the 6th\\" has a very Latin flavor. The title track, \\"Backatown\\" is very atmospheric and probably my favorite so far. \\"Neph\\" also shares that really atmospheric vibe and feels very clear and clean.     How he manages to integrate all these styles so flawlessly is just ridiculous. The real key to it all is Shorty's virtuoso talent alongside his ability to keep it all rooted in that original New Orleans style of jazz. Those same roots and virtuoso come through the most during the last track \\"928 Horn Jam\\" - a short song that is exactly what its name suggests.     Like I said, I really hope he goes far and that his talent really catches on. He's already been featured in USA Today and Entertainment Weekly and I hope that he continues to be recognized for what he's worth. He's also shared the stage with U2, Green Day, Lenny Kravitz, and several other big-name acts that will hopefully make him more accessible to the public. If there is one song that would most likely break him into the mainstream it would be \\"Right to Complain\\" because it has a very catchy chorus but it still doesn't sacrifice its integrity by being too poppy.    In short, it's an incredible, diverse album from an incredible musician who's mastered his instrument as well as any virtuoso who has made their way into the public in the last few decades.     Best wishes and much appreciation to Trombone Shorty!!
045122499X|5.0|\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is still the yardstick I use to measure historical fiction. It's rare to stumble across a novel that can measure up to Follett's classic, and I was very leary of his \\"sequel\\". I wasn't sure how it could possibly stand up to the original tale. The world Follett created in \\"Pillars\\" was so rich in detail, and the characters so well drawn they became real. And while I've enjoyed most of Follett's other novels, none of his other writing captured the magic I found in \\"Pillars\\".<br /><br />The great news is that \\"World Without End\\" is so entertaining, and creates a whole new world populated by wonderful (and wonderfully awful) characters, that the novel stands on it's own as another masterwork by the author. While it compliments \\"Pillars\\" and does make mention of some of the characters and setting from the novel, \\"World Without End\\" does not require a thorough knowledge of the earlier novel.<br /><br />The actual storyline is basically the life and times of 4 people who happen to meet when playing in the woods as children. Over the next 1000 pages we follow the kids through various struggles and triumphs, and watch them grow and see how the world changes around them. All of the political intrigue which drove \\"Pillars\\" is back with a vengeance in \\"World\\". All of the romance which propelled the reader through \\"Pillars\\" is once again present in \\"World\\"...basically Follett changed the formula slightly, but kept all the fantastic ingredients which made the earlier novel such a pleasure to read.<br /><br />I highly recommend you pick up this novel, even if you haven't read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" (and if you haven't read that book, pick it up too!!!). These two books represent a sweeping epic that you will want to revisit multiple times.
1423119509|4.0|It took almost a month to receive the books.  Once gotten, the \\"treasure box\\" that the books were in was cracked and broken on the top corners.  This is unfortunate as the cool box was a selling point on buying this item as opposed to just the books.  The books were sealed and in good condition.  I won't complain too loudly as they were a little more than half the price of buying them in a bookstore.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|This movie was amazing. Fun and resonated on a very personal level. I think everyone has had a summer in their life. Great movie. Great DVD.
0060558121|4.0|Interesting subject, but the treatment leaves a juvenile taste. The old pantheon is quite well delineated. The new group of gods are victims of poor profiling.<br /><br />This is one of the few books in the genre which does not make strong distinctions between good and evil. i am reminded of Miyazaki animations where an evil character can do good things and vice versa.<br /><br />Humans are petty, and so are gods. But both exist and are in harmony without any proselyting. Neither group takes the other very seriously. maybe all religion including atheism should be like this.<br /><br />I wish Richard Dawkins would read this book, and then other and earlier science fiction, although the thread is not easily self-evident.<br /><br />Although the style is stiffling and rather inadequate, the story line is strong and carries you through to the end quite quickly and without skipping.<br /><br />The huge amount of physical discomfort due to the weather, the geography, the structures, the vehicles and the lack of sufficient clothing reduces the ease of empathy. I could only identify with my friends of many years, the old gods. As for the new ones of Mr. Gaiman, the ones i struggle with in my mundane life are much better defined.<br /><br />It is neither dark enough nor comical enough to be called 'dark comedy'. It really is no \\"Barton Fink.\\"<br /><br />I also found it somewhat too American. For someone who is not very familiar with American life and culture, the book will be definitely less enjoyable, and would get fewer stars from a global perspective.<br /><br />Also, it is definitely not for the 'monster hunter' or 'good monster/bad monster' readers.
B001HN69AY|2.0|Ordered this film on Box Office, and was really excited knowing it was Heath Ledgers last film and that knowing he was such a fab actor that the film was probably going to be quite good.  Well I was very disappointed, Heath was fantastic as usual but the film was absolutely dire, I just couldnt understand what it was all about it was very bizarre, this probably didnt help in me taking a liking to the film.      Good job really it has Heath, Johnny, Jude and Colin in it.  Overall a real disappointment :-(
B000AWYOGE|2.0|I had high hopes for this one.  I am a huge fan of Jennifer Connelly and scary, atmospheric movies, but this one was just kind of boring.  There were no surprises for me and the story developed very slowly.
B00003CXQY|5.0|This is one of my favorite--if not my favorite--Disney animated films.    The humor seen here is considerably different from how they normally do things. The first time I saw it, I didn't even think it was Disney.    An excellent movie, and well worth the addition to your collection.
B00005JK8K|1.0|This is a really poorly done movie. There is a dependence on violence and explosions every few minutes that is totally unrealistic. The film looks like it might have been made by 6th graders. I think the idea of making a film about the Navajo contribution to the efforts of the USA during World War II was a fine concept, however this idiotic film is not the one. The battle scenes were increasingly comic since Japanese soldiers would attack the US forces screaming but rarely shooting. There is one scene where Marines are all drinking beer from mugs, singing the same song, sloshing their mugs into the air together. Such a scene is beyond formulaic stereotypical cliche. The film is so bad it wears you out watching it. There is only one real bright spot in the film, which earns it at least one star. That bright spot is the great acting of Adam Beach, the only real positive thing in this movie. He is a very good actor, trying to hold a foolish film together with the force of his sincere and open acting style.  However, one good performance does not make a film worthy of watching. This film is terrible.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Great band.  After a while, some of the songs start to sound the same, but it still rocks.  Worth checking out.
B000087EY0|5.0|I know the whole story from watching the movie itself. I mostly bought it to learn all or most of the dialogue from watching the dubbings in French, Italian and German. It's amazing. I even learned the past tense of verbs used only in literature and history. Mufasa's Ghost used to be so difficult to memorize by heart from watching those languages. Now it's become easier. I used to buy the read along dvds to write down on my notebook. Now I buy them to learn dialogue that I keep mishearing.

B00003CXB4|5.0|When I was 8 years old, I wanted lion king so bad. One day I came to my mother and closed my eyes. When I opened them, there was the Lion king platinum edition DVD. The features were fun to play with or watch. Looking at the bonus content on both discs now makes me think of my childhood. I replaced it with the latest release on other Amazon websites. It's my absolute favorite Disney movie alongside little mermaid.

0143034901|5.0|The deeper I got into this book, the more I loved it. It contained so many different stories within the main story, yet I never felt distracted or impatient to get back to the main storyline. If I had to find something I didn't like about The Shadow of the Wind, it was that in the beginning I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight.<br />Great atmosphere, believable characters that grow on you, and wonderful storytelling. A+
B000002JSR|5.0|This album gets such negative reviews. There are two kinds of Led Zeppelin fans: The ones who only like their hits (Stairway to Heaven, Kashmir, Dazed and Confused, etc) or the former half of their career, and there are those who just love Zeppelin and the direction they went with their music as they progressed over time. I belong to the latter, so my review here is based from a great love of the band. This album is made of outtakes and songs not put on albums previously throughout the existence of the band. I would place this album above In Through the Out Door, truthfully. I still like that one, but Coda is better in my opinion. Just give this a try. If you like Presence and BBC sessions you will probably dig it. Go into it with an open mind. This may have been released after Bonham's death, but this is all stuff from the complete band. It's gold.

0743298039|5.0|This is absolutely the best story I have ever read.  It's a story within a story.  I can't wait for any sequels.  I give this book as gifts.
0553579908|5.0|When I heard they were making an HBO series of this, i heard the pitch was \\"The Sopranos in Middle Earth.\\" That pretty much nails it. This is a story of family dynamics, brutality, and ruthlessness in a land with low-key magic that almost takes pleasure in defying conventions. It also has no problem bumping of major characters and is in no hurry to get finished...and somehow you don't care.     I highly, highly recommend the audiobook read by British actor Roy Dotrice. Like being red a bedtime story by gandalf. Fantastic stuff, even if it clocked in at a whopping 36 hours.
B002XHN776|5.0|I've seen a lot of confusion about what this album means - who are we going to war with?    Take it in what sense thou wilt, and know that I am just about as cynical as they come.  And after watching my civilization driven to near-collapse over the past couple of years, it seems a dark cloud has been hanging over everything.  It's hard to feel good anymore, to feel like anything you do matters, which feeds a vicious cycle of negative thought.    This album says, unequivocally, throw that away, forcefully.  Take those feelings and kick them in the face.  Reject!  Refuse!  This is not what humanity was made for.  Take that latent power inside of you, break free of this horrible, dark shell, and remake the world.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Let me come clean right up front here, so opposed to the hype surrounding Avatar was I that I literally refused to stand in line with the drones that flocked to the theatres a few months back.  Friends of mine went down one by one, succumbing to the propaganda, the rave reviews, the hoopla but alas I was steadfast in my resolve.  Hype, or so I've concluded throughout the years, is a film destroyer.  It has the capacity for raising expectations beyond what's achievable and, after all, unmet expectations is simply another way of saying disappointment.  With the exultation surrounding 2009's Avatar, I feared there was only one place for it go in my appraisal and you can be sure my having held out for so long before finally giving the film a chance was an abstention laced with ambition of discrediting those critics before me who were haplessly tripping over themselves with admiration.<br /><br />After all, I reasoned, computer generated imagery is essentially the bane to modern visual storytelling and you would be hard pressed to find a movie more dependent upon it than this one.  I am the stick-in-the-mud who will always take the original Star Wars trilogy over the more recent one, Star Trek II The Wrath of Kahn over the 2009 retooling, 1981's Clash of the Titans over the CG-heavy remake and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings over... oh wait, so there is one example of technology-laced filmmaking that has managed to rival my definition of \\"classic\\" visual storytelling.<br /><br />It turns out my plans of disputing Avatar's unrivaled ambitions were very short lived indeed and I shouldn't be all that surprised either.  This is James Cameron after all, the man who brought the world The Terminator, Aliens and Titanic.  It seems like about once a decade, Cameron becomes inspired enough to remind everyone in Hollywood how it's done.  Perhaps his greatest ability, aside from having an uncanny knack for telling stories that capture the very highest highs and lowest lows of the human condition, is his knack of suppressing the temptation to simply harness the latest techniques in filmmaking, but rather to surpass them even if it means reinventing the very process itself.  But before I get ahead of myself here, let's take a moment to review the hard facts.<br /><br />Tracing its development roots as far back as 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film, Avatar is set in the year 2154, when humans are mining an abundant mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush natural satellite of a gas giant (Polyphemus) in the Alpha Centauri star system.<br /><br />Though officially budgeted at $237 million, estimates put the actual cost of the project closer to a little over $300 million in production alone, with some additional $150 million for promotion. It premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically overseas on December 16 and in North America on December 18 where it immediately began breaking several box office records.  It went on to become highest-grossing film of all time in North America and worldwide, stealing the title away from Cameron's own Titanic, which had held the records for the 12-years prior.<br /><br />Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, of which it captured three: Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction.<br /><br />According to Cameron himself, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements coupled to 40% live action, and makes use of traditional motion capture miniatures (models) as well.<br /><br />Work on the film had been delayed since the mid-1990s if effort to allow filmmaking techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray the project's unique vision. Since photorealistic computer-generated character models were an absolute necessity, Cameron integrated new motion-capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.  Among these was an improved method of capturing facial expressions, whereby the actors wore custom made skull caps fitted with a camera positioned directly in front of the actors' faces at all times; their facial expressions and eye movements were then transmitted to directly to the computers for animation layering.<br /><br />Additionally numerous reference cameras were implemented to provide the digital artists multiple angles of each and every performance so as to provide unprecedented shadow effects and reflected light between digital elements.<br /><br />So even in taking into account all of the inconceivable digital techniques required to make the film possible at all, a budget that could make Bill Gates sweat, a roster of production talent with credits predating the use of panoramic lenses, and some of Hollywood's brightest up and comers and most revered veteran actors alike, what is the Avatar experience like?  It's surprisingly impressive and I'm not referring to the superfluous visuals alone either.  Michael Bay has certainly proven to the world that eye candy alone does not a good film make.<br /><br />Avatar opens with Sam Worthington's character, Jake Sully's narration; an appropriately drab tone that hints to the conflict within him that will later become the core of this grand tale.  There are undeniable homage cues that fans of Cameron's Aliens will certainly recognize in the early sequences especially; long distance space travel with cryogenic suspension, a rigid and heartless military, a greedy corporation behind the financing of the operation and so on.  In fact, now that I think on it, there are even mechanized loaders present and Sigourney Weaver to boot!  All that's inexplicably missing is Bill Paxton.<br /><br />Believe it or not, a strong argument could be made that Avatar is in fact simply the inverse of Aliens- In that both tales work from the idea of human beings forcefully annihilating an alien race on their own turf.  Aliens does so with the human's best interest in the foreground, Avatar tells the same story, only this time from the point of view of the victims.<br /><br />The undertaking by which Cameron manages to switch the viewer's loyalty from his fellow humans to the indigenous inhabitants of the alien world Pandora is nothing shy of genius.  Much of the film's 162-minute runtime establishes momentum to accomplish this feat.  Rather than \\"force feed\\" the good guys and the bad guys here, Cameron approaches the tale by presenting the opposing points of view pretty evenly and simply steps back to allow the viewer to decide who is right in the debate.  In the end, and certainly a forgivable trait, the conflict becomes a bit more black & white. The hope of course is that by then the viewer will have chosen sides with the same conviction that drives Jake Sully.<br /><br />It would be impossible to skate through this critique without mentioning the highly publicized visuals.  And while I am doing all I can to avoid heaping praise on an already mountainous pile, the truth is that the visuals deserve a lot of the credit for taking what boils down to a typical tale of imperialism, oppression, and suspension of rights (that in many spots plays out eerily similar like events from our own history books) and turns it into an ethereal experience that isn't soon forgotten.  For not only was the production crew charged with the arduous task of showing in intricate detail an entirely fictional world, they had to create an entire race of inhabitants that though more animalistic than human beings, were every bit as human as we ourselves (and perhaps more so at times).<br /><br />Failing to inspire viewer sympathy for these primal Pandorans could very well have been the kiss of death for the entire picture but such concerns are futile as Cameron and company nail the objective a hundred times over by the film's conclusion.  Chalk it up to a combination of solid casting and lessons learned from classic animated filmsfrom the likes of Disney, the digital animation process here uses oversized eyes and near-caricature-like overly exaggerated features of the character models to ensure the complete and utter inescapability of the viewer's emotional surrender.<br /><br />Further tying the prose together is the patented James Cameron love story; a bittersweet poignant whimsy that somehow manages to break down the emotional walls of even the most impassive (and skeptical) of viewers.  And with that comes an indescribable feeling of tension throughout the entire experience in simply knowing that Cameron is no stranger to concluding his works with the death of characters you come to know and love in the name of timeless artistic tragedy.  Throughout the film I found myself struggling to maintain a level of emotional detachment out of sheer remembrance of Kyle Reese, young Newt, and a very popsicle-like Jack Dawson.<br /><br />The scoring is, as is perhaps expected from a film of such high-class production value, top notch as well.  James Horner's soaring composures take the visuals to new heights (sometimes almost literally) while introducing a sort of tribal rhythmic tone to the formula that is ineffably appropriate.  While it presents no danger of dethroning John William's Star Wars theme as the most whistle-able tune of all time, there is little debate to the fact that Avatar's soundtrack will likely adorn the CD-players of countless folks who, until now, wouldn't have considered themselves the movie soundtrack type.<br /><br />So in all, would I be so brash as to suggest Avatar as a film that would appeal to nearly everyone? Surprisingly, perhaps.  A self admitted science fiction aficionado, I came in with high expectations of Avatar's highly publicized alleged revolution of the genre.  While it wouldn't be considered hard science precisely, there is just enough space travel and mecha usage to keep my brood satisfied.  Action junkies will surely find much to love here in this firefight-heavy roller coaster ride and even the emotional-set will likely clamber to the Na'vi 's portrayal in earnest (box of tissues at the ready).<br /><br />In fact I could go as far as to say it's rare indeed for a film to come along with such universal appeal but then again to do so would be to discount Cameron's rich and extensive catalog of titles up until this one.  The man who made the world fear Schwarzenegger, admire Sigourney and cry for that kid from Growing Pains has somehow managed to raise the bar again, this time with ten-foot tall blue skinned aliens and a story that offers irrefutable testament to the fact that no matter how jaded the world around us becomes, the human heart was, is, and will forever be one driven by love.from the point of view of the victims.

B002ELM5HY|4.0|Excelent effort by Mark Knopfler who doesn't get encapsulated in one type of music.  He dares explore his musical roots and asserts himself again as great composer.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|I'd recommend them but they will require a LOT of break in time.  I think 150-250 hours of constant play is about right.  Right out of the box they don't sound so great and the stereo imaging isn't very accurate.  After they break in, the stereo imaging definitely improves and the headphones are very even and smooth.  The one thing lacking is bass but I don't mind it too much.  I think they're good for mixing but you need to know what you're mixing in...so be sure to listen to lots of reference material.      These headphones are open backed so they leak noise and you can hear everything going on outside of you.  But they sound great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I usually don't ever waste my time writing reviews but felt really passionate about this product.  I started using the DVD on April 20th  (a total of 4 times so far) and have seen results.  I'm a mother of 2 - the oldest 2 1/2 yrs old and the youngest almost 1.  My body was fine except my stomach as you can imagine.  Girdles used to be my method of holding my tummy back - but it can only do so much.  Today, I am wearing a dress that I've had in my closet for some time; without the assistance of the girdle.  So to put if plainly, this product does work.  I'm still on level 1 but intend to start level 2 in the middle of the week.  I was NEVER a physical person, but Jillian's coaching seems to get me through.  And the fact that its only 20 minutes long makes it easy to do before I cook dinner and pick up my kids from daycare (all after working 8 hrs).  Give it a try, you won't regret it.  I've tried a lot of gyms, work out dvd's, quick pills and this is the ONLY thing that has worked for me!  Good Luck!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Madonna always gives us the best performance is possible, the vogue choreography  and dancers synchronization is one of the best song I liked to listen, watch and enjoy. Then the first time I saw her singing \\"Don't cry for me Argentina\\" I started to cry, because I was in Mexico and I couldn't go to that show, I went to Foro Sol in Mexico but it wasn't the same.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|This was excellent when my daughter hated tummy time - we could put her on the floor where she could see the mirror and she'd happily stare at herself and bat at the toy for a good 15 - 20 minutes (forever in baby time).  Right now she's 5 months and it's still a good distraction, but she's more interested in the tags on everything.  I think it will become useful again in a month or two when she can sit up and rock it and then further down the road when we can unlock it and she can crawl after it.  I don't know that it's all that educational, though.  And, as in all battery operated toys, the songs will drive you batty.  I liked it so much, though, that I bought one for my cousin and her new baby.
1439190275|5.0|I love the new book--I should add that I am second generation Atkins.  I still have my mom's hardback book from the early 1970's.  I grew up thinking that celery, olives, and cream cheese wrapped in dried beef were the best snacks ;)    When I gained weight after my first pregnancy I took my mom's and my midwife's advice, \\"steak and salad, chicken and salad; snack on cheese and berries\\" and easily lost 30 lbs.  After my second pregnancy, I tried weight watchers because it was \\"healthier\\"--lost five pounds in 12 weeks, and my skin and hair dried out, my nails peeled, and my menstrual cycle stopped. I was paying to be starving all the time, and my husband who travels for work found it impossible to eat out healthfully on a low fat diet.  Our kids, like us, eat carbs to excess when they are available.    So with the new book we are back, very happily, on Atkins.  It is so well written. It is less convoluted than the books since Dr Atkins died, and the research seems on the mark.  My husband can always get a chicken Caesar salad or a steak or salmon fillet with broccoli or asparagus and some berries for dessert. This is actually what they serve at most business dinners--just skip the bread and potatoes.   My kids think that mashed cauliflower tastes as good as potatoes.  I easily get 25 grams of fiber a day.  I look better, I feel better, I have more energy.  Yeah!      The kindle version is not so good--no table of contents and like all recipes in kindle format they are all messed up.  That is my only complaint but I'm not going to downgrade my rating because of this.
B000000WJZ|4.0|Overall, Amazon.com provided a good service. I got the best deal! :) The only downside is that when I opened the package that the CD had arrived in, the front of the CD case was cracked.
B000QXDED6|4.0|Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel \\"300\\" is impressive.  The movie has an overwhelming surrealness about it, due largely to the green-screen effects of the movie, perhaps; but once you've accepted it, it doesn't get in the way.  Gerard Butler and the rest of the cast do a great job.  The narrator (also a character in the film) grew on me as time went by.  And whatever Gerard Butler does with his jaw and teeth throughout the movie is fascinating.  An entertaining diversion.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I purchased 2 of these HDMI cables from amazon.com.  Both are connected to the same TV.  One is connected to an ATI Video card and the other to a WDTV media player.  Each cable works great on each device with the resolution from both being 1080p.  For the price of these HDMI cables you can't beat the value.  I have only owned them for 1 month.  If any problems arise I will amend my review.
B000002HHB|5.0|my aunt who was in college at the time would listen to tigerlily as well as 10,000 maniacs, when she gave me this cd i was about 8 or 9 and LOVED it. there was something amazing about her. at the time, most kids my age were into nsync/ backstreet boys and later britney and spice girls. and me... i was singing wonder and candy everybody wants. i've recently fell in love again.
B00004RF97|5.0|Wonderful cast (2 of my fave actors - Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart), awesome plot, lovely settings and scenery, great humor & dialogue... a little bit of everything for everyone.
0385341008|5.0|This is an interesting book...chosen by our book club.  The book is an easy read which gives a view of the German occupation of Guernsey, which is part of the Channel Islands.  Events are shared through differing perspectives, giving the reader a fuller view.  It is worth reading.
B00005RHGK|4.0|yeh. ok. some the movie is kinda slow in spots but it did what a horror movie is supposed to do -- creep me out! you watch both of the jeepers creepers movies and throw in Mothman Prophecies and i'm set for night of fright.
0385341008|5.0|I literally judged this book by its cover.  Or rather its title.  But I fell in love with it from page one.  It really is one of the best books I have ever read.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I enjoy this cd a great deal. We play if often and give it as gifts. Ray LaMontagne is so talented.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The scariest movie I have ever seen involves no ghosts nor zombies, psycho killers nor mutant spiders. Instead, it tells the story of four confident individuals connected by friendship, love, and family who all share a common goal - to finally make their biggest dreams come true. For some that dream is to obtain a \\"pound of pure\\", while for another it is to appear on television. The film follows each character and their whimsical reveries as their lives, both present and future, are overtaken by a whirlwind of drug addiction.    Requiem For a Dream, from director Darren Afronofsky and writer Hubert Selby Jr., is one of the finest examples of cinematography I have seen, unmatchable in its concept and delivery. Unlike many movies adapted from novels, it does not fail to portray the story effectively. Instead, with its captivating score from Clint Mansell, including the stunning \\"Lux Aeterna\\", it introduces another dimension not available in the book. The music is as much a part of the movie as the story itself. When the pictures fade, the melodies replay themselves over and over, tearing into your heart note by note.    The cast certainly does not disappoint either. Actress Ellen Burstyn performs an outstanding job in her role of Sara Goldfarb, the TV addict who lives to eat and praise her son Harry. Burstyn becomes entirely immersed in her part as she delves into the horrifying realm of addiction and loss. Along on her journey are lovers Harry and Marion (Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely) and their close friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Despite being an unusual role for these less experienced actors, they too do a superb job of transforming into their specific parts.    This film is no mere 100 minutes of entertainment. The plot is far from enjoyable and is rather slow at times. Nevertheless, it is a captivating, nightmarish tale executed with mastery. Requiem For a Dream is an exceptional example of the powers of film - the ability to express a sense of reality unlikeany other art form. As you experience this story, it is impossible not to sympathize with one character after another. You witness their lives slowly shatter while they are torn apart from the people they love. It is a movie you beg to end, but are too hypnotized to stop yourself.     The most sickening, yet powerful part of this film is that what you see is no fantasy. The horrors of this tale are far from fiction. Even if it is not apparent in your life, it is in the world around you. The purpose of Requiem For a Dream is just that - a wake up call reminding people of the fragility of life, love, and the human mind. It is a film everyone should see, but few may want to expose themselves to this tragedy.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|For me, there is a subtle similarity between the singing voice of Mark Knopfler and that of Bob Dylan. I start my review with this observation because I truly believe the music that Mark Knopfler (former Dire Straits frontman) is creating these days is the kind of stuff that Dylan should have gravitated toward after turning 40. Get Lucky, Knopfler's latest is another smooth, relaxed, melodic and intelligent effort. It's the kind of music to sit back with and enjoy. It reveals a veteran songwriter who is comfortable in his craft, and because of this the storytelling comes easy. The experience is like sharing a fine wine amongst friends, reflecting on times shared, feeling comfortable with the present, and yet still eager for tomorrow. Mark Knopfler's solo stuff is top shelf. I'm already looking forward to his next release. Oh, if only Dylan had went this route sometime after Empire Burlesque.
1416550550|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had a different story line, good characterization, some mystery, some romance, and an ending that left me satisfied. A very pleasant read that does not leave you unsettled.
0307463745|4.0|Great book.  This is really appropriate for people thinking of starting their own business.  It is more geared for businesses that can be wholly run and operated via the internet (i.e. I don't see how not having VC for some new hardware specific company is feasible).  It is well written and motivating.      The only problem is that you will read this book and find fault with whatever company you are currently working in!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This cd is the perfect mellow collection!  Bon Iver has a gift for creating songs that ease and relax the soul, I can't listen to it enough!!
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|I liked this movie,I had always caught bits and pieces on different cable channels over the years, and finally just bought a copy. I love the beginning and middle, but the movie fizzles a bit and I lost interest before the movie ended. I am glad I have it, it's great for stylists, designers, and photographers to reference.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I received this as a gift and almost returned it, as I thought it was just another \\"Greatest Hits.\\" Instead it was a treat for the mind's ear. Some of the tracks are just great to listen to (such as the first), while others are like an auditory jigsaw puzzle. A few I like better than the originals. Recommended if you love the Beatles, but perhaps not for the casual fan (Is that an oxymoron?)
B000P0J09C|5.0|This is an excellent war movie that doesn't seem to pull any punches. I particularly liked the first part, when Joker and his friends are being trained at Parris Island. Very realistic. When I was in recruit training in the Australian Army, we heard stories about \\"Blanket Bashings\\" as protrayed in this movie. I loved the scene with Vietnamese Hooker. \\"You handsome man, I love you long time\\". The exterior scenes set in Vietnam, seemed very realistic, considering this part of the movie was shot in Spain!! Excellent Movie - go out and buy it
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Why so much complaining? Most people already know another version is coming out.  You could only call it double dipping if the studio didn't tell you about it.    So wait for the other release, and quit bashing this version.  A lot of people don't care about bonus features, director's cuts/commentaries,  and all the other stuff. I can barely find time to watch the movie itself.     Let's face it no matter what version you end up getting,  nothing will compare to the IMAX or 3D you saw in the theater.  But even for 2D, the quality is AWESOME. The picture literally  jumps off the screen. So yes they did use A LOT of data on this disc.  And although 3D for home is promising .. who wants to replace all their gear again?  I sure the heck don't. You're talking Receiver, Blu-ray Player & Display, not  to mention the 3D Glasses. Ouch for a family.    By the way, this is no unique business model. Everything sold follows the  same principle. How do you make more sales? Make it better or different.  How about that new computer .. a month later, a better, faster, cheaper  one will be out there. How many times has your favorite CD been released?  The list goes on and on.     I say enjoy this film now. Life is short. More important things to worry about  than when the \\"other\\" version is coming out.
B000000WGL|5.0|I am a fan of Keith, and all I can say is I'm glad he made this record.  I get a smug \\"satisfaction\\" knowing that the general public and many Stones fans don't know this work even exists.  At the same time, I wish more people would discover it.  Keith rocks in these songs, and he put together a nice, tight group of X-Pensive Winos to record them.  I listen often.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|To those complaining that this isn't the longer cut...keep in mind this isn't a bunch of live action footage, it needs post-production work. Do you know how long it takes to finish the longer cut? It takes if i recall 27 or 47 hours to render a single frame. That's why it won't be out til november, they're trying to get the post production results up to snuff. What are we gonna do sit on our hands and wait til November? Watch poor theatrical bootlegs? [expletive] that! As for a lack of features, the whole notion of them wanting to maximize space by making it barebones is nonsense i do have to admit, that's why you make two disc editions! Use one for the movie! The Second for special features! That's my one complaint!
B0038VPB5W|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about this CD after the experiences I have had with The Poison, Scream Aim Fire and Hand of Blood, for I enjoy listening to Bullet For My Valentine when I am writing short stories and working on my novels.  I thought it was going to be hard for the band to move me the same as they have so far in their careers, but I have to say they have never let me down.  I can feel the power that the band puts into their art and I am sure I will be able to use their enthusiasm to help me focus on my own art. Their spectrum of music is broad in so many levels and soothing to my soul.  Matt's vocals hold my attention all the way through their songs while Padge's and Matt's guitars reach right down into my mind and vibrate the blood to flow freely as it opens up doors to my imagination.  Michael's drums and Jay's bass drive right into my heart and makes me flutter with excitement.  Well done Bullet!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Just buy this! it is a great movie. I watched it 3 times in 1 week, It's a must have!    If you like movies this will not let you down. GREAT acting! GREAT picture (get blu-ray), GREAT music, GREAT STORY!    5 *****
031606792X|1.0|Even though I couldn't stop turning pages from the moment I started reading Twilight up until the end of Breaking Dawn, I have to add fuel to the fire and agree with the reviews above me.  I'm not going to go into detail since the other reviews point out my reasons pretty eloquently, so this is all I'm going to write.  My disappointment after finishing Breaking Dawn was such that I felt compelled to write my own sequel.  The moment I saw the way Meyer contrived her so-called happily ever after, I started thinking about all the things that could potentially go wrong with that setup, so the wheels in my head started turning like mad, and I simply couldn't stop.  I felt an inexplicable burden to imagine what would happen afterwards.<br /><br />This is not an ego trip, me trying to show the world that I can do it better than Meyer and blah, blah, blah.  No, absolutely not.  For me as a reader and an author, it's about getting my closure, my true happy ending, my catharsis, my spectacular epic battle at the end of the story.  That's what the fans deserved, but, instead, we got a totally far-fetched, contrived, unbelievable, inconsistent, anticlimactic disaster of an ending.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I admire the rhythm of Steph's writing.  I find her prose to be poetic and intense, passionate and even addictive, which is why I devoured those four books like there was no tomorrow.  Sure, I'm not going to deny that she can be wordy at times, but, somehow, I was able to see past that and really get lost in the story.  I love her characters, especially Jacob, and, if it were up to me, the Twilight Saga would continue.<br /><br />As a screenwriting major in college, I learned the basics of structuring a story, so I told myself, what the heck!  I gotta cope with my disappointment somehow, and this is my way of doing it.  Writing a sequel to Breaking Dawn in which a lot of complications come up as a result of its weak ending seemed like a fun hobby to pick up, so I didn't hesitate.  I started writing and writing, and I'm still at it to this day.<br /><br />But since I'm a total sucker for vampire romance novels, I got over my I-don't-wanna-read-anything-other-than-twilight phase and I gave other authors a chance.  I have to say that by now I've discovered two other vampire book series that totally drew me in, namely Claudia Gray's Evernight series and Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy series.  To make a long story short, I have found out that YES! there is life after the Twilight Saga, and it's much much better!  I mean, these two authors, Gray and Mead, are superb story tellers.  They know what they're doing, and I honestly can't understand why their series haven't been produced as movies yet.  While reading Richelle Mead's Blood Promise, I found myself having to stop just to cry, because this woman got a hold of my emotions in a way that very few authors have done it.  Bottom line is I believed everything she wrote.  I never questioned her decisions as a storyteller and my suspension of disbelief never got shattered as it did with Breaking Dawn.  Now I'm eagerly, no, wait, more like desperately waiting to read her next book \\"Spirit Bound.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed Mead's writing so much, that if someone were to put a gun to my head and tell me I can only read one of the two books: \\"Spirit Bound\\" or \\"The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner,\\" I would choose \\"Spirit Bound\\" without hesitation.<br /><br />As for my sequel to Breaking Dawn, since this is a book review of Breaking Dawn as opposed to shameless self-promotion, I'm not going to leave any links to encourage you to read my tribute sequel.  If you're interested in reading it, all I'm going to say is that it is available online for free, it's told from Jacob's POV, and its title is Russet Noon.  A simple Google search will tell you everything else--good and bad--about my story.<br /><br />I conclude this review by reiterating just how disappointed I was when I reached the end of Breaking Dawn.  I mean, really, who's going to be interested in reading about some random newborn vampire's short second life?  That's no consolation for me.  I'll read it mostly out of curiosity, but I still think that the Twilight Saga should not have ended with Breaking Dawn.nterested in reading about some random newborn vampire's short second life?  That's no consolation for me.  I'll read it mostly out of curiosity, but I still think that the Twilight Saga should not have ended with Breaking Dawn.

B001GWUBSC|5.0|When I found out that they made a series about King Henry VIII I was like I have to watch this now! I agree with some of the others post, do not rely on this series for a lot of in depth history. Don't get me wrong there are some very powerful political history points in this series but the episodes are just not long enough to cover all of the historial points that were happening then. Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a great king! I own the first and second season, about to order the third and watching the final! Definately a great series!
B001C4AFOY|3.0|The settings, costumes, and backgrounds to the film were beautiful.  Emily Blunt was wonderful in her performance as Queen Victoria but the story line was so boring and seemed to have moved rather slowly.  As I watched the film, it felt like the actors themselves were bored making the movie.  The passion between Emily and Rupert wasn't really there.  The writers could have done so much more with the unrest of the English people and spent more time dramatically with how Victoria turned her people's hatred of her into fondness and love, celebrating that she is still the longest reigning monarch in British history.  The movie was a glimpse of various scenes into Victoria's life with no substance to them.    When the film ended I thought to myself, \\"that's it?\\" It was as if the writers didn't really know how to end the film and their choice made it feel like it was a documentary instead of a dramatic period piece.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" is the best show I've ever seen, bar none.  Why it never went the distance is an absolute mystery to me.  Humor, drama, sci-fi, western motifs, romance, mystery...the list is almost endless.  It has everything you could want in a show (and then some) and for some reason it was canceled.  When you can laugh, hold your breath, tear up, be POed, and ponder the Big Questions -in every single episode! -  I'd say you've got a winner.  Too bad Fox didn't think so...
B0039TD8LW|5.0|If you have the Full Amplifier Version of Backtracks, then this collection will make you go weak at the knees. And no its not a best of hits collection. Any live Concert is where you see the best of their hits. The package is brilliant and well thought out. ACDC is the superb band, and the most appropriate for Iron Man ( other than Sabbaths Tune of the same name). Whilst the Package has nothing new except the content from Buenos Aires, the orders that go through acdc dot com come with a limited edition Litho ( mine was 4645 of 10,000, arrived today ), and the damn thing is so going to be framed !!!  This is a high quality collection of songs and material that so few bands produce and its great that acdc and their record company put the REAL Special edition out with a super Litho. The Movie will hopefully rock as hard as the boys do, and if it does, then this will be one major hit for the Theatre. ACDC Rocks, and they also produce the best damn merch in the business for the fans.  You MUST buy yours from acdc dot com to get that Limited edition Litho, it is worth the Money !!!!!!!!!!!!

B002SF9YNO|5.0|I don't know what more I can say about this stunning film that hasn't been said. It was the surprise winner of the '08 Oscar for Foreign Language Film, so I was compelled to rent it. Best move I've made. After research, this film won every Japanese Academy Award, as well as many other Asian film awards. This is a film about life, and the love story adds to the beauty of the goings on. Indeed, death is part of life, and I would wish I'd be put to rest in as dignified a procedural as depicted here. Despite the morbid suggestion, there is lots of humor to alleviate the serious tone, and it also lets one know, rather encourages one, to let those you love to KNOW it before it's too late. I adored this film for it's simplicity, truth and absolute honesty. I was quite blown away.Acting is impeccable, and direction is perfect. There's a sweetness that makes you want to watch it again. DVD extras are fine. I recommend this film to all, without reservation.
1592289444|4.0|There is a silver lining to being a former prisoner of war - the story. Many hostages have told their narrative in the form of a book, but few have obtained the prestige of The Long Walk. The Long Walk was ghostwritten by Ronald Downingin 1956 based on conversations he had with Slavomir Rawicz. Rawicz has never actually written a book of his own, and his story of escape from a Siberian gulag has many critics. But, regardless of the criticisms, The Long Walk delivers both historical and philosophical knowledge in a way that is both endurable and entertaining.               When Downing wrote The Long Walk Rawicz was the only primary source, leading to widespread suspicion among scholars; possibly none more damning than Russian historical records. Rawicz's story begins with a detailed account of an interrogation he endured at a Soviet prison camp, which closely parallels the torture endured by Winston Smith in the fictional novel 1984. While the records do show that Rawicz had been imprisoned in 1942, they contradict Rawicz's claim as to why he was being interrogated. Rawicz claimed that he had been accused of being a Polish spy, while the records show that Rawicz had been accused of killing a NKVD officer. After being imprisoned, according to the book, Racowicz devises a successful strategy for him and six others to escape the Siberian gulag he was forced to labor in.. But, Soviet records, including statements allegedly written by Rawicz, show that Rawicz had been released as part of the 1942 general amnesty of Poles in the USSR, negating the possibility of a \\"trek to freedom\\".                  Of course there is little doubt that the Soviet officials had fabricated or destroyed many legal documents in an attempt to marginalize the many war crimes that had been committed. In fact, at the beginning of The Long Walk, Rawicz allegedly was subjected to torture as an attempt to coerce him into signing a document professing his own guilt. Therefore, theoretically,compulsory signing of documents also may have been used to debunk any future claims of Soviet cruelty.               Despite the attacks on the validity of Rawicz's story, the book raises critical philosophical questions.  The fugitives' entire quest forces the reader to explore the endurance of their own determination. The tenacity of Rawicz and his six friends spawns the question of just how valuable freedom is. Were these escapees' extraordinary humans, or is liberty so essential to happiness that weeks of unfathomable torture are not even substantial to dissuade man from achieving it?              Since there is no inherent value that each person places on freedom, the claim cannot be made that freedom is essential to each individual. In fact, because of the controversy regarding the validity of Racwicz's story, we cannot certify that Racwicz himself actually had the determination to accomplish the feat told in the story. Therefore, does someone exist that actually does have the determination and will power to face nearly impossible odds in order to achieve freedom? Are there people that are so uncompromising that liberty becomes indispensable to them?              Fortunately, Captain Rupert Mayne, an intelligence officer in Calcutta, said that in 1942 he had debriefed three emaciated men claiming to have escaped from a Siberian camp, adding to the probability that at least three men carried out the dubious feat. Also, Witold Glinski, a Polish WWII veteran living in the UK, claimed that the story was true, but it had actually happened to him, not Racwicz. Therefore, most likely, Racwicz was either telling the truth about his experience, or had stole the story from Glinski. Either way, Racwicz did deliver it to a mass audience, and reflected to that audience just how precious freedom can be.              Although Racwicz does answer some exceptionally beneficial philosophical questions, the relation between The Long Walk and history is severely impeded. Raciwicz's reliability is not definitive and, therefore, neither are the events described in the story. But, although the relation to history has been damaged, it is not destroyed. Some exceedingly valuable historical knowledge can still be salvaged from the wreckage. Even if Raciwicz was being dishonest, he did get his facts straight. Many former prisoners have testified that the conditions and treatment endured in gulags correlate with Raciwicz's description. Secondly, the book recounts the atmosphere of animosity that prevailed during 1940's Europe. Europe was in the middle of World War II, and Racwicz's account does a tremendous job of presenting the alliances and general dispositions that people had toward others outside their nationality. Lastly, The Long Walk gives  the reader a description of the cultures of Mongolia, China, and India. In each country Raciwicz encountered natives, and described the rituals and customs of those natives, in turn broadening the culture of the reader.              Therefore, even if the story is untrue, Racwicz delivers historical knowledge in an entertaining way. Any teacher knows that people enjoy digesting what captivates them, and it is difficult not to be captivated by The Long Walk.
B00104QSOM|4.0|As others have written, there cannot be enough said about the power and significance of this film. A truly artful masterpiece, more so that it entailed a collaboration of immense talents. This \\"Special collector's edition\\" however is a joke and a studio swindle. Do not buy it there is nothing on the 2nd DVD but some stills and odd tidbits of footage that are irrelevant. Buy the single disc edition.
193413712X|2.0|I have to say, this book was a colossal waste of time. Don't bother unless you have nothing else to do.   Perhaps the Pulitzer judges should have waited to award this first time author the prize in Fiction. He obviously has great writing skills and will undoubtedly produce some fine novels in years to come, but I didn't find this book worthy of such distinction.
030745455X|4.0|I read this book really fast, its a page turner.  I read the first book and saw the movie.  I think this book is even more fun than, \\"Girl with the dragon tattoo\\".  Loved it.  FUN READ.  I can't wait until the movie comes to the U.S.
1593081545|2.0|Fanny Price is the poor, orphaned girl who virtually serves as a servant in her wealthy cousins' house. Only her cousin Edmund Bertram treats her even remotely as an equal, even though she is of a higher moral character and behaves with greater refinement than they. When newcomers (brother and sister Henry and Mary Crawford) come to town, they charm the Bertrams. But the Crawfords are shameless and lead various members of the family into ruin.<br /><br />I read this book for the first time in either high school or college. I found Fanny so preachy and pallid as to be unpalatable. Even after re-reading (I thought, \\"Am I missing something?\\"), I hated the drab main character so much that I can't find one nice thing to say about the book. Read any other Austen book--they are all delightful.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|The movie/discs are fine with the exception of no digital copy.  Seriously, given the technology today and higher price of the Blu-Ray discs you would think they could give you the digital copy the way many other studio's will.  I guess the first reviewer was right, should not have purchased this disc.    Greed has superseded \\"the right thing\\".  Sad.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I have been enjoying this CD since I have recieved it, or I was until my honey ran off it with it. Now he is enjoying it as much as I am.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|The one star reviews based on the business of making money selling dvds are not fair in the sense that they are pulling down the rating. Okay, I get it, they are probably going to come out with another set of dvds with more features. I don't see how that has anything to do with a review of this version, which is very good. I did not see the movie in the theater, but I can say that this is my REFERENCE quality Blu-ray. It has the best overall picture, better than any Blu-ray dvd I've seen, and I'm a movie buff.  The sound quality (DTS-HD) is also very good but the picture is amazing. Even though it's not 3-D, the depth of field is strong and the clarity and color, stunning. As for the movie, it would be 2 1/2 stars, good, but the production quality is so strong that the overall rating is 4. If you have a good big screen tv and surround sound system with a Blu-ray player, I don't see how you can't enjoy this. Director James Cameron doesn't make very deep movies, the dialog and plot are always pretty simple. But his films are entertaining and the production quality is cutting edge.
B001GJ2ZP2|5.0|I base this opinion just on the first side of the album. I haven't even listened to the rest yet cause I'm so into the first side.    I don't know what it is about it- I'm usually more of a guitar-based music type of person but this album has mostly synth or keyboards(?). Anyway the songs have great beats and rhythms. The lyrics are kind of besides the point. IMO   I'm going to see her in Philly in September!    Wonder if she can keep this up without the \\"FAME\\" getting her off-track? Hope so. :-)
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I didn't know I could still find new details in \\"Serenity.\\"  But the Blu-Ray edition of the film is really that clear and crisp.  No synopsis here, but kudos for Joss Whedon, Zoic (who did the visual effects), and of course the whole cast.  The story is involving, and the characters, in spite of being far removed from our world, are strong and believable.  And there is a LOT of action!  See it.  On Blu-Ray.  You'll be impressed while you're being entertained.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This series is an excellent production done by HBO.  The binder that the CD's came in is great.  You have a book mark to place which CD you are on and each CD gives a little narrative.  Highly recommended.
B000UD67IG|3.0|While I really enjoyed the book, it was definitely not in \\"new\\" condition.  It was very much a used book that the seller sold under \\"new\\".  The other book I purchased from a different Amazon sourch was \\"The Collectors\\" and it definitely was a new book.  The difference in the shape of these two books was pretty substantial.  With that being said, the story was very good - another great book from David Baldacci.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I have to admit I was apprehensive about watching this movie but since watching Robert Pattinson in Twilight and Remember Me I have grown to admire him as an actor and read all the reviews about this film before deciding to buy it. I was NOT disappointed. It reminded me alot of the movie BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN..not comparing it in any way but just the story reminded me of it. I didn't think it was boring at all. Robert's performance just blows me away. He is just awesome in every role i have seen him in. I really felt sorry for the character he plays in the film as well the other actor who plays Federico. Great job on everyone's part. I am glad I bought the dvd. I watched it with an open mind knowing he was no Edward Cullen in this film and I think it takes a very secure man to play this kind of role. I applaud Robert and the other actors.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|this was an aweso me book. its about friendship hott guys dating and how best friends deal w things their friends do. i totally rrecommend.
B002VZC9CY|5.0|The care the producers -- and Ms. Merchant -- put into this CD is evident.  What a beautifully packaged experience: it's a book, a bookshelf of children's stories, a journey into the past lives of fictional children and adults who create them. (Biographies of the creators of the stories and poetry flesh out this unusual volume.)    Carefully rendered, this is not a throw-away CD. Her voice, phrasing, arrangements are so pleasing.    Sigh.

044024367X|2.0|A friend loaned me #13 \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" a few months ago, and I then went back and read #1 through 11 in order.  I enjoyed them all, although the villains in #13, 1, 2, and 3 (the first four I read) had a real emphasis on how physically cruel they were, which isn't my thing.  The first sign of trouble for me was #11 \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\", when Child suddenly decided that Reacher was some kind of mathematical savant and then beat us over the head with it in an annoying fashion (I also thought up a more satisfying ending for \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\"...there was a real missed opportunity for suspense when Reacher was returning in the plane!).  Now I must agree with most reviews that #12 \\"Nothing to Lose\\" is really disappointing.  I'm about three quarters through, haven't even really made it to the overt political/religious opinions, but I think I've read enough to move on.  As a parting shot, I notice that Child doesn't appear to have the mathematical dexterity he claims for Reacher: he sees a keypad with ten digits on it and figures that means there are 3,628,800 \\"variants\\" (and then has to start figuring out how long that would take depending on \\"typing\\" speed)???  Yes, that number is 10! (10 factorial), which is an INTERESTING number, but the wrong one.  That would be the number of different arrangements you could make out of those numbers using each one once and only once.  But who says the combination is exactly ten digits long and can have no repeats?  People who claim no special mathematical skills know that with phone number, digital combinations, PINs, etc. where you can repeat digits, there are TEN possibilities if one digit is required, 100 possibilities for two digits, 1000 possibilities for three digits, etc.  No factorials required, Reacher.
B002AFX52S|1.0|No matter how I set my screen or set up the player it's impossible to see the subtitles completely.  Not worth the expense in BluRay either.  Get the DVD and save some money.
B000GT6KEU|1.0|Here's why I love the Rent OBC/NYTW cast: Because they sound so real. Raw. Unpolished. Adam Pascal (okay, he wasn't in the early NYTW, but still) and Daphne Rubin-Vega stand out particularly; the prior had had no theatre experience pre-Rent (none! They found him singing with his band!) and the latter has such a unique, raspy sound. (Daphne also has been Mimi since the beginning. She played her originally, in the workshop, off-Broadway and on, as well as on the recording.) Maybe what I love about Rent is that it *doesn't* sound like a musical, it sounds so *real*. I also am always so impressed at how real the relationships seemed, and how the actors seem so connected to the characters (read any Daphne Rubin-Vega interview... she's like Mimi in a lot of ways).    That being said, I was very excited to watch the movie. I was incredibly disappointed. There, I said it. I hated it.    If you've heard the early recordings of Rent, you know that this show kept getting more and more commercial. I love the Broadway version (the originals are so angsty; not better, but  very... raw), but this movie was too much for me to handle. All their voices sounded so polished, many songs were cut, Joanne became a Soprano (huh?!), the plot changed (not quite has many break-ups, you'll notice, and Take Me or Leave Me was ruined), and I could not feel *any* of the relationships between the characters. Angel and Collins were the only two characters I could tolerate, but I'll Cover You was still too pop-y, though the I'll Cover You (Reprise) made their relationship slightly more real than the others. And what happened to Contact? Kinky, raw, fabulous Contact? Where did that song go? Not to mention Christmas Bells! And the Voicemails! And my favorite songs: Happy New Year A&B? How about Halloween and the rest of Goodbye, Love? (I watched them afterwards on the DVD; this was the only time I liked Rosario Dawson slightly, shame they cut it.) Bonus points for including some original cast members,I guess, but they looked so awkward on a movie set, not a stage (I miss Michael Greif's staging!!). And they didn't even film it entirely in New York! Instead of it being a true musical about bohemian life, it turned into \\"Look how cool and fun being poor is! Hehe!\\" The glamorized the issues seen in the musical. For the first time, the cast felt like actors to me, not like real people. All of them seemed so isolated.    Anthony Rapp: Without Halloween, I didn't grasp Mark quite as well. La Vie Boheme was too commercialized, and it showed. (Jonathan Larson wrote about things he loved. Hollywood Producers ruined that song.) I *loved* him in the show (and I was lucky enough to see him in it!), so the movie was a let down. I couldn't feel the Mark-Roger friendship, either. (As I say below, perhaps it's fame, but Anthony wasn't as connected to Mark as usual).    Adam Pascal: Sounded too theatre-y, too commercial, and I felt *nothing* between him and Rosario (it's alright, I hate her too, Adam), nor the friendship between him and Anthony. Adam Pascal had such an amazing, raw and real sound; it was polished over here, and it took loads of the emotion away. And what happened to Roger being more, well... angsty and bad-ass? Hmm? I miss the eyeliner and the nail polish. His character was seriously watered down. (Plus Roger is with April when she gets her HIV results in this movie, so it's assumed she didn't commit suicide but died from something HIV-related... as another reviewer mentioned, I felt this took loads away from his character). Maybe to widen the appeal, make the movie more socially acceptable? This Roger seemed sad, not angry. Meh. I love Adam, and I saw him on tour last year, so I know he capable of being *amazing*. Which is why I'm so sad he wasn't. (Maybe fame does this to people, but I felt like he wasn't as connected to Roger in the movie. Maybe because he already has 'glory'?)    Idina Menzel: Again, I felt no relationships, this time between Maureen and Joanne. Her voice sounds too polished as well, and Idina didn't need it! She's amazing anyways! They should have left her how she is, because here she just sounds fake. This Maureen was rather toned-down, as well, though probably to make the movie have wider appeal. The engagement mess irritated me. I did not like it.    Tracie Thoms: I did not like her, but I suppose she did the role some justice. Making Joanne a soprano took, for some reason, something away from her character for me, and her voice sounded fake. She didn't seem to have the strength and intelligence stage-Joanne had, but she did alright. Her relationship with Idina was non-existent, in my opinion. Again, I was annoyed with Take Me or Leave Me.    Jesse L. Martin: Good! Only character I felt they really did preserve, kudos to him. Still a little to edited, though.    Wilson Jermaine Heredia: Without Contact we lost some of him (her?), in my opinion. I missed Angel's witty lines in Happy New Year, as well! But this character held okay... I don't remember having any specific complaints. Wilson and Jesse had the only believable relationship.    Taye Diggs: ... Meh. He was alright. The fact that You'll See was so early was enough to have me irritated with him from the very beginning, though of course that wasn't his fault. Some of Benny's character was simply deleted to me, there was something that made him feel less real. But he did well, better than most of the cast at least.    Rosario Dawson: I could rant *forever* on Rosario Dawson. I do on a daily basis. (I get really irked when people who saw the film then heard the original cast say that Daphne played Mimi wrong... she originated the role, people. She can't play her wrong). Yes, Daphne was seven months pregnant. Yes, she couldn't have done the movie. But did they have to bring in a *celebrity*? One who can't sing, nonetheless; her voice sounds like its been edited for three hours. Her Mimi was glamorous, and I despised that. The entire movie glamorized the issues in Rent, and Rosario Dawson was the worst of it. She and Adam didn't work, in my opinion (the only time they did was in one teeny part of the Without You montage, but I was so pissed there was a montage in the first place that I didn't really notice that the first time), though she was certainly pretty enough for the part. I miss Daphne's raspy voice (Mimi's an HIV+ stripper on drugs who most likely smokes. She needs a raspy voice.), I miss the connection between her and Adam, I miss seeing Daphne's struggles, her brilliant expression, and her amazing emotion. Rosario was emptier to me, and despite the fact that they replaced the original Mimi costume (Another thing: I. Loved. Those. Pants! They came from Daphne's *closet*! The majority of the costumes came from the actors closet! Realism! vs. Hollywood falsity) she was a watered-down Mimi, and just seemed like a whiny teenage brat.     I'm glad that the message of Rent is being spread, true, (although it brought a bunch of so-called Rent-heads who don't even know what they're talking about and have only seen/heard the movie, which drives me nuts) but did they have to do it in a way that seemed so... fake? All in all, stage-show for the win. By the OBC if you don't have access to it. Nothing beats the original.
B00371QQ8Y|5.0|Excellent transfer, the best traffic has ever looked.  And, the double sided disc (Blu-ray on one side, DVD on the other) works just as well as a single sided one; there is no rational reason to complain about them - especially when given the cost they are much cheaper than most packages that include a seperate DVD.
1557048630|4.0|The only downside to reading these kinds of artbooks is coming to the end. There's tons of fantastic work in this book, and when I finished I only felt hungry for more, heh. Oh well.     I'm giving this one four stars merely as a comparison to the Kung Fu Panda artbook I also own, which I felt was a bit more thorough. I found myself craving more pages on the design development of Hiccup and Toothless, though granted there are a ton of great drawings crammed into what is there. And I was pleased to see a few pages devoted to general storyboards, which were spread out over the Panda book.    But for those who aren't interested in the comparison, I do recommend this book to anyone who likes \\"Art of\\" books. It didn't quite quench my (admittedly ravenous) thirst for development art on this fantastic film, but it sure was a treat.
B0026RHR6K|3.0|i absolutely love battlestar galactica that being said i hate this box set and heres why. the discs are held in place by the most flimsy peice of cardboard i have ever seen. said cardboard is far from secure and is more likely to damage the discs than hold them securely. each season has its own set however there is ABSOLUTELY no episode guide no special feature guide or even a simple list of whats actually in each section. looking for a particular episode? good luck finding it if u dont have an idetic memory and know exactly which disk its on. oh and the cylon toy/figurine looks and feels like a cereal box toy. its big its technically acurate but if you intend to buy this item for it your wasting your time. in short buy the individual seasons seperately it may cost more but is a much better investment.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|First let me say it was an excellent movie, good story and graphics. My only issue and reason for 4 stars is, I must agree with another post, RDJ did mumble alot and I did miss some lines due to this.
0307463745|3.0|Not a bad book once you get through the first quarter of it. The early pages, about funding and forecasts, are a bit too specific to the kind of business the authors are in although the sentiment is sound - take as little money from others as you can. Unfortunately the delivery was as if all businesses could be run this way, which is a nice thought but doesn't fit every model.<br /><br />Later on the book picked up and held my interest. I did feel it was a collection of well put together blog entries, which isn't such a bad thing but ran a bit thin; just a taster of each idea and then it moved on. The style suits the readers who follow the authors's blogs but probably leaves the rest of us wishing there was more depth on each topic.
B003C5FMBM|5.0|Released in 1967 \\"Disraeli Gears\\" was Cream's sophmore release. The band was clearly going in a different direction than their first release \\"Fresh Cream\\" released a year earlier. Where \\"Fresh Cream\\" was primarily blues based, \\"Disreaeli Gears\\" was new territory especially for guitarist Eric Clapton. Incorporating his tasty blues licks and experimenting with different sounds by cutting back on the use of treble he came up with a sound he called \\"Women Tone\\" (I believe this is what it was called but I may be mistaken) as well as the use of wah wah on some songs (\\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"World Of Pain\\") the band's sound fit right into the psychedelic movement that was gaining popularity at the time. To say this album was influential to many up and coming young guitarists would be an understatement. Songs such as \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"Swlabr\\" and \\"Strange Brew\\" were often favorites played on rock stations throughout America. Even Jimi Hendrix did a version of \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" so you know he must have been impressed by the song as well as the band. This edition of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" which is part of Universal's \\"Rarities Edition\\" cd's contains the entire album in mono as well as various outtakes. If you already own the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" you won't need this as you'll already have everything here plus more. What you have is a condensed version of it and nothing more. The sound quality of this cd is excellent and the extra bonus tracks (outtakes) is a nice addition if as  already mentioned, you don't already own the \\"Deluxe Edition\\". Also, for the record, the gold Ultradisc II version of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" also included the mono version so this is the third time that it's been released on cd.

B000084HAJ|4.0|Deutsche Grammaphon in the past has provided menus on their DVDs that were models of lucidity and ease of use. Not so on this one. To access the 20-minute bonus feature that shows conductor John Eliot Gardiner explaining the newest research concerning the Monteverdi Vespers, with a stunning visual background of Venice and its waterfront, you must use a procedure that defies logic. After choosing English as your language and selecting Bonus from the Main Menu, you must then select \\"Subtitles Off\\"--any other choice will bypass the bonus feature and throw you immediately into the 90-minute performance. How does this defy logic? Because there are no subtitles, contrary to Amazon's product description. (Another departure from DG's past virtues.) In order to know what is being sung, or even what section of the work is being performed, you must have the program booklet open while playing the DVD. Furthermore, I was able to find  the access to the Bonus only by trial and error.    This is a pity, because this performance of Monteverdi's masterpiece (one of the most significant examples of sacred music from the early Baroque) is superb, and presented with audio and video quality fully up to DG's usual standards.
B003954I9C|4.0|[AN: THIS IS MY REAL REVIEW, THE OTHER IS A FLUKE, SORRY!!]<br /><br />First things first, yes, I am a Backstreet boys fan. Yes, I have been one for 13+ years. And, yes, AJ is one of my fave in the group.<br /><br />Good, now that we've gotten that off our chests. Let's do a real review.<br /><br />The album is a departure from the pop ballads and dance floor singles that made BSB famous, for the most part. See, AJ ain't no fool. He knows why people like him, and he gives you just enough of that on this album to not feel too removed from his internationally successful boy band. However, he still ventures off the pop path just a bit to showcase his amazing vocals and songwriting skills.<br /><br />The good points: It's a solid solo effort. The lyrics are more mature, the arrangements aren't from a machine, and many of the songs you could see performed in a small bar venue as opposed to a stadium size concert hall. You get songs about one-night stands, love lost, and love found. But, instead of it sounding like a teenage boy crooning to his girl between classes, you hear a grown man really singing the pain, joy, and complicated existence that is love. And, AJ's smooth, yet raspy voice sounds exceptional over carefully produced tracks.<br /><br />The low points: The overall production of the album could have been a bit more polished. The first half of the album goes from up-tempo club hit to smooth ballad to romantic mid-tempo with an ease that does not stay throughout the album. As you go through the last half of the album you're wondering if it will gain its momentum again, and it doesn't. And really, that the only gripe I have with the album. It's really a lot better than most people will believe.<br /><br />Overall, 4½ stars. If it was a more polished album I would've given it 5. But, if you were never a fan of BSB or that pop era at all, you may be surprised at how much you'll like it. And, if you are a fan then this is a nice treat to the faithful fans that had been waiting for this much anticipated album.<br /><br />Listen to: \\"London,\\" \\"Gorgeous,\\" \\"What If,\\" and \\"Teenage Wildlife\\"m.

B001GCUO4S|3.0|\\"The Final Destination\\", released in some countries as \\"Final Destination: Death Trip 3D\\", continues the series with barely a reference to the previous 3 chapters, and with a fair degree less effectiveness.  It admittedly had a high bar to live up to though, and is still worth watching.       In the Final Destination series, a number of catastrophes have been avoided by a character having a premonition which directly results in them, and a group of other people, avoiding that forseen fate.  Death then seems to come after them, though, as if it's deliberately trying to reclaim each person who survived because of that premonition.  In Parts 2 and 3, vague hints that could have been the beginning of links tying the separate incidents together were forming, but that's been dropped here and we get right to an all-new scenario and all-new characters.  In fact, one watching this movie without being aware of the others might hardly guess that this was actually the fouth and not the first entry.  Expecially since they dropped the \\"Part 4\\" and simply added \\"The\\" ahead of the title.  In any event, this chapter opens at a Nascar-type racetrack, where a multi-car crash-up spills into the stands and kills quite a few spectators.  It's reminiscent of the highway disaster in Part 2 but not as effective.  After the character of Nick (Bobby Campo) foresees these, he creates a commotion that gets himself, his friends, and a few nearby strangers thrown out of the stadium right before the explosive crash-up.   Shortly thereafter, death starts coming for the survivors.       One weakness is with the way death comes this time.  In previous entries, the incidents were usually spectacular, and at the same time could have each, by themselves, been written off as once-in-a-lifetime freak accidents.   Only the way these freak accidents continue happening, targeting survivors, reveals that there's something far bigger and stranger than coincidence at work.  Here, the individual incidents (of what I think of as Death's \\"Backlash\\" effect) are not only a bit weak (for the most part) compared to the previous movies, they make less sense.  For example, some water spills on a countertop.  For some reason this causes a drink container to slowly slide across the counter until it hits a lever, which causes something to short out and kill somebody.  Now, there's a way to take this wonkiness in cause and effect as something that actually works, if they want to follow up on it in any future sequel.  Death could be getting stronger, perhaps Because of the whole premonition/backlash effect.  So say early on, it could take a one-in-a-milion probability and make it happen; now it can take something so far out that it wouldn't likely be seen as simple coincidence, more like a one-in-a-billion probability, and use that to its advantage.  Just a thought, because otherwise many of the deaths in here seem very contrived.       Okay, there's the negatives.  Positives - not all of the death backlashes are that weak, and some - even allowing for far reduced cause-and-effect, do come off pretty impressive.   The production values are very high as is par for the course in Final Destination; the female cast members are gorgeous, as is par for the course; and at the very end the movie finally re-captures a sense of grandeur.  I can't really get into that without giving away the ending, but something about it struck me in a particular way that just adds to my thinking that they may be planning the introduction of some really new elements for the future.  That something bigger may be coming.        The characters, admittedly, weren't as strong this time out.  The acting itself was fine, and I thought Mykelti Williamson (George) and Haley Webb (Janet) managed to milk the most out of their roles.        Now onto the 3D.  I've seen both the 2D and 3D versions of the movie, although the 3D wasn't in a theater.  Actually, because the town I live in doesn't have RealD technology in itstheater, I've yet to see the new wave of 3D and how impressive it's supposed to be (Note to self: this summer, get yer rump to the nearest city that Does have a 3D theater in time for Piranha 3D and/or Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D).  However, based on the home viewing experience, The Final Destination made possibly the best use of 3D I've yet seen, not in the stunts it went for but in the visual quality.  One home sets (I don't have a thousand dollar flatscreen but my set isn't a bottom-of-the-line piece of junk, either) the 3D is still impressive, but sometimes the picture's hazy or the color scheme takes a beating, tending toward black-and-white on certain, mainly a bit older, releases.  The 3D on The Final Destination was sharp, for the most part holding its color and its clarity.  The 3D improved on the 2D experience in another way.   Most of the Final Destination series has had very good special effects.  In this one, there are a few times where they don't look nearly as real, but these generally improve when watching in 3D compared to 2D.  Perhaps they were specificall designed for the 3D format and looked Really good on a RealD screen.  But there should be a way to keep them looking good in 2D as well.  None of the sequences were awful in 2D, just not always up to the standards of the series.       In the end, this is still very much worth seeing.  It's behind the others in most ways, but judged on its on merits is still a very enjoyable movie.  And the Final Destination concept lends itself exceptionally well to the 3D format.  Note for connosseurs - the 3D hologram cover is pretty impressive itself.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I saw this a few hours ago with a friend, and personally, I thought it was awesome! It was literally filled to the brim with action, comedy, and special effects. Clay, Roque, Jensen, Pooch, and Cougar are part of an elite United States Special Forces team that are on assignment in Bolivia. When they are betrayed by an enemy named Max, they become fugitives and are believed to be dead. They are forced to team up with a mysterious woman named Aisha who may be able to help them find Max. I understand this movie is based on a comic book by Vertigo, but I never read any, so I couldn't compare it. My favorite character was Chris Evans as Jensen, because he had all the hilarious lines. Another thing, was that this film reminds me a lot of 'The A-Team' If you love action, I highly recommend THE LOSERS!!!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|When you just want to watch a fun flick this movie fits the bill.  All ages of viewers will find some fun in this movie.
B0021L9ME6|4.0|I have owned this movie for six years, and I finally watched it last night. I honestly don't understand all the low ratings. I know that Catwoman was a villain in the Batman comics and movies, but this was a new version for a new generation. Berry plays Patience Phillips, who is a shy artist working for a cosmetics company. While she is delivering a new design to her boss, she overhears a plot to sell defective beauty products that will make your skin decay. She is murdered and reborn after a cat with supernatural abilities breathes new life inside her. Soon, Patience slowly transforms into Catwoman, and tries to bring her killer to justice. I highly recommend CATWOMAN!!!
0312360258|2.0|I just could not get into this book.  I really wanted to be into, into the entire series because the covers look awesome.  I don't know if it is because it is book 1 and its introducing the concept and characters but it just didn't grab me.  The character has really immature language and the way she speaks just turns me off from this book.  It's just plain boring, and maybe if I got past the first 5 or so chapters it might become more interesting but at this point I am doubtful.  I will most likely finish this book sometime and hopefully it will prove me wrong but it won't be anytime soon.  I've had this book for about 5 months or a little longer, and I have other awesome books that are on my list way before I try this out again.
B003405MF6|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I was so blown away by this album I had to share it and hopefully turn someone on to what I think is the best album to come along in a while. Every track is outstanding but I must admit that Nessum Dorma is my favorite, it is simply gorgeous. I didn't think anyone could do this piece better than Pavarotti, after all it was his signature piece but Jeff has done an outstanding job of making this song fresh, new and all his; Puccini and Pavarotti would be proud. Jeff has always been high on my list of the most talented musicians out there and this album just proves once again how talented he really is. It's exciting to see how musicians grow and try new things, I only hope we don't have to wait so many years for more.
0810983915|5.0|This was no doubt the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid book out of all of them. This book takes place in the summer . Greg just wants to play video games all summer, that's his explanation of a good summer. But his mom has different ideas for Greg and his family, like going to the water park. Of course, Greg hates family things. You will have to read the book to find out what happens during the rest of his summer. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes the series.
B00006I53S|3.0|I bought this lens thinking it is made in Japan since all the pictures on the website shows lens made in Japan written on the front lens rim.  But it turns out to be made in Taiwan and only have a whitebox packaging.  This is very disappointing.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is a great CD album of the best pop group out there. I have been fans of these guys since I was in 8th grade and I am now in my mid 40's.
0060786523|5.0|I received this book as a gift during a long convalescence, and enjoyed it so much that I have re-read it twice and am perfectly capable of reading it again with the same undiminished pleasure. Seth's characters are immensely likeable and quirky, and his description of India at a turningpoint in its history is a thought-provoking, rich tapestry weaving the fortunes of several families over a period of a single tummultuous year. Several reviews have pointed out the length of the book (it is indeed quite long), but that is hardly noticeable given the flowing narrative. Through the daily lives and thoughts of the characters, we learn a great deal about India, it's past and the different religious communities within it, their complex caste system and cultural differences in a sympathetic and unbiased manner. Highly recommended.
193413712X|5.0|How lovely that a tiny little book (less than 200 pages) can pack a wallop worthy of the Pulitzer. I more than loved this book. I'm tempted to keep it by my side to just reread paragraphs at random.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I'm not the biggest Sci-Fi fan, but I can tell you that this movie was awesome.  Not to spoil anything, but District 9 had great special effects given it was made outside of Hollywood, and a storyline that wasn't so linear and predictable like Avatar's.    I loved this movie, and hope they will one day make a sequel.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Season 1 concludes with lots of questions unanswered and endless possibilities as to where the show can go. Season 2 picks up exactly where the first season left off and immediately jumps into even crazy action. Anyone worried the show might jump the shark can rest assured it does not. Walt and Jesse experience to the fullest extent what situation they've gotten themselves into and Walt is clearly shown what his actions have caused by the season finale. This season really changes the characters introduced in season 1 as they fight for success and their very lives. With its fair share of humor mixed with edge-of-your-seat suspense, this is a fantastic show and I highly recommend it.
1573300403|5.0|This DVD includes Thriller, and Beat It, a repeat from Vol. 1, but buy this one anyway. Smooth Criminal, Earth Song, They Don't Care About Us, are all worth the price.
B0037W68F4|1.0|Horrible album cover.  It's like a Sega Genesis throwback to the early 90s box art for Sonic the Hedgehog.  The music is well... weird.  If you're Lennon-McCartney, you can pull this stuff off with genius lyrics and melodies.  This is a wandering psychedelic mess that could easily be the next soundtrack for a ride through Disney's Space Mountain or Haunted Mansion.  I don't get the positive reviews other than that they're from diehard fans that can't bear to criticize MGMT.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I watched this movie 3 times in a row once and even now it's still fresh and fun. I love silent hill. I played all the games so I looked forward to this movie. It did not dissapoint,yay. The monsters, from Pyramid Head to the nurses were great and it had all the silent hill features you would expect. With the rooms turning to flesh and the spinning fans and many other things. It's loosly based off the first silent hill game. The ending \\" Aylessa boss\\" in the film as i call it was cool to watch and seeing the same place, but from the real world as to the world of silent hill was fun also.
B003405MF6|1.0|Fans of Jeff Beck, I among them, should not go near this record. Unfortunately I did. It has got to be the most disappointing record I have bought in the last decade. Beck is without a doubt one of the all time greatest rock guitar virtuosos to have ever set finger to string, but stunningly enough what he has brought to the table this time is totally boring. Bad Bad Bad. Lush strings... I mean the orchestral type, noodle around while Jeff throws his patented bent notes out, hoping that something somewhere may stick. It doesn't. The rendition of I Put a Spell on You is so dead it's unbelievable. It's really incredible that someone with such great talent could deliver such a terrible group of songs, if you can call them that. I am being polite.....  Please fans, believe us, the ones who are panning this album... it's TRUE, it STINKS. If I could give it a zero, I would, unfortunately I am stuck with giving it one star.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|One of my favorite traits of Guy Ritchie films is that he doesn't take your intelligence for granted.    You must pay attention to keep pace not only with the quickly progressing and often non-linear plot - but also to absorb new and vivid characters as they come online.  Yes, some thick accents might force a quick rewind, but that's part of the charm and authenticity of this film.    I'm especially impressed by the performances of Toby Kebbell (Johnny Quid) and Mark Strong (Archy).   It's hard to believe they outshine the fine performances of Tom Wilkinson, Gerard Butler and Idris Elba, but they do.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are incredible,  do yourself a favor and buy this zeitgeist CD immediately :)

B0016AJU2C|5.0|I didn't really know what was on this album, just wanted more Alanis after listening to the 2 CD's of hers that I had owned for years.  Shopped around a little here on Amazon, found a few and picked 2 Alanis Morissette CD's.  I didn't fail because they are both very good.  You just can't go wrong with Alanis, she is amazing!
0307269981|5.0|This is  a great series. You have to read the Girl With The Dragon Tatoo first to get into the story and you have to be able to go with the flow on the swedish stuff such as street names, money and political systems, but the story is awesome and i can't wait to read the next one. the problem is that the author died and the 4th book which was only half done is on his computer and his father and brother will not allow his girlfriend to have it finished and published so those of us who love the series will have to be happy with how the third one ends and make up our own solution.
0385504225|5.0|This book is a great read and I found it incredibly hard to put down.  I loved the twists and turns that had me constantly reading just one more page.  Personally, I thought [[ASIN:B003A02WR6 Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon)]]was the best of all of Dan Brown's books, but I have a new favorite now, The Lost Symbol.
B002RCEBBI|3.0|I am a huge fan of Consign to Oblivion and We Will Take You With Us, two of Epica's previous albums.  I also really like several songs from The Divine Conspiracy, but this album honestly does not impress me.  With Design Your Universe, Epica has upped the ante on the use of symphonic elements, which would normally make me a happy camper, but there a few reasons why this album doesn't strike me as Epica's best work.    First, the symphonic elements, while used more heavily, are simply not as good as in previous albums.  Epica has a talent for delivering symphonic passages that manage to be quite catchy and addicting, the kind that make me want to go back and listen to the passage over and over.  Design Your Universe's symphonic elements manage to be over the top in terms of sheer bombast (not a bad thing in itself), yet bland - they simply aren't catchy.  I know Epica can do better, because they have.    Forgettable music aside, the theme behind this album is tiresome.  It is full of heavy-handed, preachy messages about getting along and doing away with greed and whatnot.  It is their prerogative to put whatever theme they want in their own lyrics, but personally, this isn't the kind of thing I look for when I listen to metal music, and it gets old quickly.      There is one track, White Waters, that really exemplifies the kind of theme I love in the music of Epica (and, incidentally, Sonata Arctica, whose Tony Kakko is the guest vocalist).  It tells a story, vaguely yet profoundly, and conveys feeling and emotion rather than a preachy \\"kumbayah\\" message.  White Waters is musically artistic and lyrically interesting, making it the highlight of the album in my mind.    All in all, this album isn't terrible, but the tiresome lyrics weigh down the already \\"meh\\"-quality music.  Epica fans will probably get moderate enjoyment out of it (I did for a while), but this is a far cry from their earlier work in terms of quality.
B003102JDM|5.0|Supposedly writers never write about anything but themselves and artists never paint anything but exterior projections of themselves.  The Coen Brothers could use this film as a dissertation proving that statement.  They say this is not about their father yet their father was a Professor at the University of Minnesota and that is where Larry Gopnik, the main character, is a professor.<br /><br />Larry Gopnik is a man who tries to do everything right, fitting in with the Jewish culture that has always been part and parcel of his life.  However, no matter how correct Larry is, in this movie the Gods turn their backs on him.  It is one disaster after another.  Hands down, the absolute best disaster is the episode involving his wife wanting a divorce and the guy she wants to remarry tries to \\"befriend\\" Larry. This guy, widower Sy Ableman, is absolutely hilarious and never more so than when we see how his plans turn out for him. The movie is one set piece after another of the trials and tribulations of Larry Gopnik in 1967 Minneapolis where he is working and raising his family.<br /><br />What this reminded me of most strongly was early Woody Allen movies.  Larry is that beset and the situations are that hilarious.  In fact, I didn't realize how much I missed those movies until I saw the Coens' do their version.<br /><br />I notice some here on Amazon rated this movie very low.  The only thing I can imagine is that they went into this thinking that it was going to be a typical Coen Brothers movie.  The odd thing is that it is a typical Coen Brothers movie IF you can manage to put aside the fact that it is entirely set within the Jewish American subculture, in Minneapolis 1967 no less.  I was raised Catholic, not Jewish, but frankly I find their predicaments pretty universal nonetheless.  I felt right at home with all the ethnic, religious and cultural craziness even though that is not my particular brand.  When you get right down to it, familial crazy is crazy, no matter which way you otherwise brand it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00006DEFA|5.0|Amadeus is a very interesting and beautifully produced movie.  The acting is very good and the scenery and costumes are authentically portrayed.  The story is of course quite inaccurate, as Salieri was a mentor to Mozart not antagonistic and certainly did not contribute to Mozart's death.  But if you overlook the lack of historical support, the movie is wonderful to watch and, of course, the music is breathtaking.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Dear Sane People,    Please do ignore this movie at all costs. I have been dragged into it when it was first released and I was extremely disappointed! It felt like watching an adaptation of Disney's Pocahontas starring the Blue Man Group in drag and talking funny! Unless you really need to see something like that, I think it must be ignored.    What is wrong with you people?     Rob Marshall, after the beauty of 'Chicago', you give us your mess called 'Nine' Why?    Andrew Lloyd Weber, your 'Phantom of the Opera' was not only a musical phenomenon, it is now considered a way of life. Whatever happened to you when you thought people were going to buy 'Love Never Dies.' You've let down your fans, especially your 'Phantom' fans, big time. Please stick to reproducing musicals from the 50s. You did an excellent job with 'Sound of Music.' Don't come up with anything new. Please.    Last but not least, James Cameron. Terminator 2 and Titanic. Thank you for those, although the dialogue in Titanic was childish between Jack and Rose. What were you thinking with 'Avatar?' I got upset when I saw Pocahontas, Blue Man Group, and drag all over this piece. I could have thoroughly enjoyed each art form separately, without having to listen to silly nonsensical mumbling and utterance.    Sigourney Weaver! Please leave 'Wizard of Oz' out of this mess! On the red carpet you claimed that it is the new 'Wizard of Oz.' If anything, I think you need to go see a Wizard!    People, leave your egos and your previous successes at home when you want to do something next time.    Thank you,    Kamal

1435248244|5.0|This is what young adult fantasy fiction should be: imaginative, clever, philosophical, character-driven, exciting, deep, and poignant. In Tally's post-apocalyptic world, those ages 12-16 are referred to as Uglies as they wait to turn Pretty through surgery at the age of 16. Then they live lives of mindless partying and pleasure. When Tally's best friend, Shay, decides to run away from their totalitarian city and into the wilderness rather than become pretty, Tally is forced by the Specials to follow. But will Tally be able to betray her friend when she learns the truth behind her beauty-obsessed world? Being pretty might be more than just trying to make everyone equal and create peace. This book is a brilliant, clever, and imaginative fantasy allegory of our own beauty obsessed world, one that is particularly significant to early adolescence. There are no easy answers, but certainly the awful danger of conformity, especially in the case of physical appearances, is powerfully and refreshingly highlighted. The allegory goes further, as well, as it tackles the very issue of moving from the world of childhood and into adulthood (from late high school to college). The book wonderfully and powerfully captures the psychological world of the early adolescent, trying desperately to understand the changes not only in their body and world, but also the daunting future that lies ahead of them as they move out of adolescence and into early adulthood. A great book, absolutely perfect for ages 10 to 16, an easy read, but one that is deeply engaging and meaningful. This book definitely deserves a place on the shelf beside The Giver, and is one of the best fantasy books written for young adults, particularly to capture the psychological world of the twelve year-old. Grade: A
B001HN69B8|2.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie I was so excited. Big name actors and great special effects. I knew this movie would be a little different though just by the trailer.<br /><br />I don't know where to begin. I think there should have been some sort of disclaimer on the packaging saying it is recommended to be high or on strong prescription medication which I was neither. This movie is really out there and whomever made the trailer for this movie deserves some sort of award to transform the movie it is to the trailer that got me all excited.<br /><br />Acting is good but I felt myself always wondering what was going on and to be honest I still don't know what the movie was trying to portray.<br /><br />To be fair I was still somewhat intrigued by the movie but will never and I mean ever watch it again. I felt like turning the movie off and just watching the trailer and calling it a night.<br /><br />Go rent it if your really interested.
B003JL674K|5.0|There are many things excellent about this episode.  However, the absolute best is Chris Colfer singing a HOUSE IS NOT A HOME.  He has fixed up his Dad with Finn's Mom because he has an unrequited crush on Finn. However, not only can he look forward to living with Finn and never having his love requited, now he can watch daily that his father now has a stepson with whom he has a great deal in common, including love of all things sport. Chris Colfer has been a breakout star in this series as the gay high school boy who finally comes out to his Dad and his Glee Club cohorts. He totally brings it home that this hardly solves the incredible hurdles of being a gay teenager. Colfer also has an incredible singing voice. He can give everyone in the club a run for the money when it comes to singing.<br /><br />Will and April get together again and they do two wonderful duets together. April is played by Kristin Chenoweth who has a master's degree in opera performance and is known for having perfect pitch.  She has also done very well on the New York musical stage.  When she sings duets with Will, the performance is just spectacular.  However, they have less to do on the acting front than Chris Colfer did in this episode, playing a gay teen whose heart is broken over his plot going awry--of gaining a brother which ends up in his losing a father (in his eyes). Really a terrific episode.  P.S. I love the kids dressed up as food.<br /><br />Frankly, I could do without the short redheaded female teacher and Will's soon to be ex-wife in favor of bringing April back more frequently.  One thing that really makes those two characters dispensable is that they apparently can't sing.
B001KMB6X2|1.0|If I was being honest, I would say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It had potential to be alright, but the story didn't make sense at ALL. And it just kept getting weirder and more nonsensical. I am honestly sad that I wasted time and money on this movie. Do humanity a favor and rent/buy something else.
B0037AGASG|4.0|A lot of people have review Justin and NOT his music which is what we're supposed to be doing. So I think I should write my review of the music so people can see if they want to buy the CD NOT him.    Baby Ft. Ludacris: Baby is Justin's first single off My World 2.0; it's catchy and easy to dance to. And it widely shows that he's slowly growing up from his first CD. It's about the same thing every singer sings about: Broken hearts. Ludacris puts an easy quick rhyme in the middle as if saying a little of `This kid has my blessing in the Hiphop/RnB music and more of `He's on my label and I just want a pay check'. Over all not taking in to thought that this was OVERLY played on the radio. I feel it was a great first Single to put out. 4 1/2 stars    Somebody To Love: This song starts off hit a REALLY hot beat mixed in with Ushers voice. It's fast pace, and truthfully I can hear this is any `gay club' across the world. This song really shows the RnB effect he's trying to go for and I was kind of reminded of a Ne-Yo song. 3 1/2 Stars    Stuck In The Moment: This; has got to be one of my favorite songs of all two of his CD's. His voice seems to be really mature as the song goes on. Though it's a little high I wouldn't expect less of a 16 year old kid. This song is really nice talking about a relationship that's very unstable and everyone is telling the couple that they shouldn't be together but though the couple knows they aren't perfect they want to stay together because of the few times they had that made them happy. Very beautiful song. 5 stars    U Smile: Is a sort of old time ballad that shows the range Justin truly has. It's the first slow song and truly a sweet one a perfect blend of RnB and Pop. I heard his acoustic version first and though I like that one better, because it showed his talent more; I later enjoyed both and think this would be nice for a time when you just want to...Smile. 4 1/2 Stars    Runaway Love: When I first heard this song for some reason itinstantly reminded me of old school Jackson 5 music. Through out the song the pace slows, goes normal, and quickens up. It's about a boy wanting that girl who he can't seem to keep. It's a really cute song. 3 Stars    Never Let You Go: This is the second single, and a song I can't help but liking, its VERY sugary sweet pop. It's a song that every Pop singer must have to start his career. 3 Stars     Overboard ft Jessica Jarrell: this is Justin's first duet. I don't know who this girl is, but Justin and her voice blend very well together. There voices girl off this youthful soul of harmony. It seems as if they did this so easy it gives off he works well with other singers! 4 1/2 Stars    Eenie Meenie Ft. Sean Kingston: This is my least favorite song. It seems as if it was thrown together in 4 minutes with no though. I'm not a big Sean Kingston so my opinion maybe a bit bias. They only part I can stomatch is when Justin finally comes into the song, then it quickly goes down hill again from there. Even someone with Justin's talent can't save this song from being a cheesey mess. 1 star    Up: Ok THIS is the song that you let people listen to that think Justin has no talent. This song has no flaws, in my opinion. It's a slow jam that gets you relax with his gentle voice and smooth lyrics. I couldn't imagine anyone else singing this song as perfectly as Justin did. I let a few people listen to the song that disliked the song and instantly fell for him. 5 stars    That Should Be Me: it's a very depressing song. About a boy who is watching his Ex with another boy, and he still wants to be with her. The song goes on sounding as if Justin is truly on the brink of tears, it's very emotional. And after listening to it nobody can help but feeling sorry for Justin and his broken heart. 4 stars     Lastly throughout the whole CD it's AMAZING how mature Justin's voice has gotten in such a short time.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Excellent period series, amazing how familiar some of the sets are from my kid days
0061537969|5.0|I couldn't put this down and stayed up all night to finish it.  The plot is most unexpected!<br /><br />How did this book impact my life?  Since reading it, I now talk to my dog only in whole sentences.  I don't want her to pick up any bad linguistic habits...
B002XMGGJM|1.0|Blu-Ray dic was very poor sound quality, the saying of the words on screen did not match the sound. A product of this kind should not be sold, i paid good money for a poor product
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I too look forward to the 3D release of Avatar, but realize that the technology and standards are not quite ready, and decided to pick up the Blu Ray for my brother and I to watch together.  We had both seen the 3D version in the theater some months back.  We watched this edition without interruption on a Mitsubishi 73 inch DLP with 6 channel surround, and found the experience nothing short of stunning.  We actually agreed that the presentation on Blu Ray seemed to have more impact than the original 3D theatrical experience. The combination of a very strong story, impeccable special effects and cinematography, and very high quality transfer, seemed to be the reason.  For anyone doubting that Avatar was a 3D gimmick, they will have no doubts once they have seen this release.    To top it off, the studio provided a Standard Definition copy along with the Blu Ray, something that contradicts the accusation of taking advantage of the fan.  At a price of barely over $20, this release has to rate easily as the best deal I have found yet in a Blu Ray release (of which I buy relatively few compared to regular DVD).    It seems to have become fashionable to bash a studio for \\"milking\\" their product at every opportunity, and no one criticized the release of the Lord of the Rings Blu Ray set more than I did, but the similar reaction by many to this release amazes me.    Can I wait for the \\"extended 3D edition\\"?  Absolutley not, and this in no way compares to the Lord of the Rings example.  First, the producer is faced with considerable online piracy if he does not release the film sooner rather than later.  Second, no fan has yet seen an \\"extended edition\\" so the comparison is invalid.  Third, many fans will never buy the 3D version anyway, so why prolong the release of the regular Blu Ray version.    I for one will instantly buy the extended, 3D version when it becomes available, but this will not be for everyone.  I highly recommend that any fan of the movie pick up the Blu Ray and enjoy the original theatrical experience again in the highest quality Blu Ray release that I have yet seen.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I recently replaced the majority of my parents star trek collection which were on vhs.  The movies are there and good quality.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|You need to see the movie twice or three times, you be surprised how much you missed the first time.
030745455X|5.0|It seems so long ago but it was only a few months and I was writing about my high regard for GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  The first book of this amazing trilogy.  Now here the movie is out. but I am afraid to see it.  How can it be as good as the book??  But we are here for THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, book two of three.  Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are back  This book exposes more of Salander.  What an amazing character.  Like strong, smart women?  Look no further.  The book's focus is on sex trafficking underworld but ends up a story of life for Salander.  The polce looking for Salander?  They don't have a chance.  If you want to read a good book, with action yet so well done and complicated this is it.  HIGLY RECOMMENDED.  Read first novel first!!  Now for me, on to THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST

B000AQJPQE|2.0|This toy is of very poor quality and barely works.  The motor that turns the planets isn't very powerful, and often I had to physically give the planets a push to get them started  on their orbits.  When it does run it is very loud and distracting.  And while the sun does light up, it's a very dim light barely brighter than a nightlight -- you have to turn the overhead light off to even tell that it's on.<br /><br />The planets are on flimsy wires and can fall off easily.  It takes a steady and gentle hand to hold the mobile when changing the batteries to keep from knocking all of the planets off.<br /><br />My 4 year-old loves the planets and was dying to get this, but after only 6 months we've taken it down and he doesn't even miss it.  Instead, he's taken the individual planets off of the mobile and plays with those on their own.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|One of my favorite movies! if you are uncomfy with teen on teen violence or have a weak stomach then this is NOT for you. one thing i love about this movie is the graphics to me arent \\"cheesy\\" like some horror/gory movies. I watched this movie twice the first night i saw it. at first i was just in awe b/c i honestly didnt expect it to be That Good. I heard about this being so controversal (sp) in japan and so i wanted to see what all the fuss was about. then the second time i watched it i saw the many \\"levels\\" of the story. its not just a teen killing teen movie. The story has many levels and elements from physcological to political. the actors were very committed to their characters and brought them out beautifully. the ONLY thing the movie could have done better was explain WHY this act is happening. what drove the adults/government so far to pass this? the book explains it better but the movie does give a BRief reasoning. but part of that could have been the director ran out of time so i still give movie 5 stars. memorable movie and characters. you know a movie is good when u go out and buy the book the next day!
B001OQCV6K|4.0|You need to see this movie.  It's not the run of the mill Sherlock Holmes movie.  Holmes makes the character right.
B002VPE7AQ|4.0|Perfect Chemistry is one of those books that pretty much everyone has heard about, if not read.  It's basically a modern day Romeo and Juliet story.  I read tons of great reviews for it but it didn't live up to my expectations.  It was good but not as good as I hoped it would be.<br /><br />Alex and Brittany were pretty good characters.  They were both hiding the truth behind acts of being perfect or being tough.  They were completely different but they ended up working great together.  Sadly they weren't the best characters in the book.  I actually found some of the background characters to be more entertaining and likable such as Paco, Sierra, and Doug.  They always made me laugh.  Brittany and Alex were just a bit too cheesy for me.<br /><br />The plot of the story was fantastic though.  There were things I didn't like about Perfect Chemistry but this was not one of them.  The story drew me in  from page one and I didn't want to stop reading.  The book had it's flaws but the plot made up for them.<br /><br />Overall, Perfect Chemistry is a great romance story.  If you don't mind some super cheesy lines go ahead and pick it up, if you haven't already.  I have high hopes for the next two books in the trilogy.  =]
B0026P3G12|5.0|I could sit for hours and listen to her voice, but when I started listening to the Words I was taken by the absolute sadness of the songs she chose.  I would like to see her make a CD that is a little more up
B0000AQVCL|4.0|A very catchy group of songs, but an album that brings nothing new.  Some of the songs are painfully derivative (see Look What You've Done vs. The Beatles' Sexy Sady).  Worth a listen, and maybe even a purchase, but chances are the originals are better.
B00288KNL8|5.0|I watched the movie in 3D and loved it, not just because of the animation but because it introduces some very real aspects of spiritual belief during the sleeping hours. For those who have studied the spiritual world will recognize the symbolism in the story. It is a must see for anyone who has taken a critical thinking class in college. It's also great for the kids.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was growing tired of lackluster Bluray releases that seem barely better than the standard version -especially with upconversion. This movie delivers on all the promises of Bluray. Electronic stores should get a looping version of this DVD and watch their sales skyrocket. I was wondering what all the fuss was about with this movie and all I can say now is \\"WOW!!\\".
B002MFU9BG|5.0|Love this album!! It is like Pulp Fiction and Beetlejuice had a baby and this is it...that is the only way I can begin to describe the feel of this album. It is awesome for a road trip. You have to listen to it loud to really appreciate it. I loved every song from the get go, and the more I listened to it the more it grew on me.  I hope they put out another album of this caliber. I love the originality and would highly recommend buying it...you cannot get the full jist of it from the snippets you hear on the samples.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I bought the DVD the day it came out (Earth Day) and decided not to watch it, so I returned it for a full refund. The next day Avatar was already in one of those Safeway rental machines for a buck. Yeah, it was worth a buck. However, because I'm lo-tech with a small 2D screen, I need to rely on storyline. Obviously, the visuals looked fake. It was hard to watch the first few chapters, but things picked up pretty well. Character development was good, not great, and the plot was OK (predictable). I would have been enthralled if this movie had underlying messages about the environment. But I guess the focus was on effects.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I'm not gonna go into detail about how bad this blu-ray/dvd is because alot of you already have.  To those of you that paid for this already knowing how bad this release is,  you should know that you're the reason these movie studios keep releasing multiple versions of dvds. You buy these bare-bones dvds then you buy the special edition in 3 months.  You're not PART of the problem, you're THE problem!
B003EVFALQ|5.0|Natalie's voice has never sounded better. This album is pure genius. Can't imagine anyone not liking her voice or this album period. What a beautiful gift to her daughter. One of the few albums I ever listened from start to finish the first listen with my ipod, and it's almost 2 hrs long...that's saying something.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video really makes you work you butt off!! You think that it's only a 20 minute workout, and that it will be easy. Jillian Michaels will make you work for it. I've been doing it for maybe a month, and I see a difference. My posture is better, my stomach is tighter, and my muscles are tougher. If you stick with it and eat right it will work for you.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Great CD, the music in the movie was wonderful and I'm glad I got to take it home with me.   Favorites: \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" and \\"Test Drive\\" I would highly recommend this CD if you liked the movie (which you would be crazy if you didn't).
B001OQCV6K|3.0|According to the post office it was shipped but is still in transit.  It is been in transit nearly 1 month.  This is the only time I have ever had a problem with an Amazon delivery.
0441009425|3.0|R. Lundquist and Christopher Lewis get it largely correct with their reviews.  It is an interesting read for those who love sci-fi, as I do, but you should not expect to have your world shaken or re-shaped by this book.  Many, if not most of the ideas used here were originated in other stories by other authors.  Now, that is not necessarily such a horrible thing.  Artists often copy the best ideas, styles and techniques of other gifted artists.  The hope is that they will build and expand upon those great ideas that came before. Unfortunatley, that is not really the case here.  Not a bad read, and I did finish it, so I will recommend it to others, but you will note I only gave it three stars.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|This movie is perfect for anyone who loves over-the-top cheesy movies w/ a historcal/porn edge. I loved watching the unrated version. And while yes, my modern 2010 brain was even shocked by some of the scenes, I loved every minute of it. What more can you ask for really? :D Other notes:<br /><br />- Helen Mirren was super hot back in the '70s<br />- Malcolm McDowell might really be insane<br />- Caligula was so effed up, but so were Romans on a whole<br />- Were the deformed actors the real thing?<br /><br />Prepare yourself for some nasty, nasty stuff!
0307454541|2.0|I started this book with great anticipation based on some raves from my friends. However the more I read, the more I got this feeling of deja vu with the main character, Lisbeth.<br /><br />She is the young, charismatic, sociopathic computer genius of mysterious circumstances  at the heart of the book.  Unfortunately she seems to be almost entirely based on a series of brilliant books by Carol O' Connell, whose main character, Mallory is also young, charismatic, sociopathic  computer genius of mysterious circumstances.<br /><br />The main difference between Mallory and the Lisbeth (aside from the tattoos) is that Lisbeth character was written by a man so of course she falls both in love and into  bed with the main character, Blomkvist,  and even makes coffee for him - something Mallory - written by a smart woman author - doesn't have to do.<br /><br />In fact, Blomkvist it seems is such a magnet, he is in bed with everyone from the neighbor across the street, to poor LIsbeth, to his married partner... Even a wandering cat gets time in bed with Blomkvist.  So after awhile the book became a farce. Everytime a woman character arrived, I wondered if Blomkvist would nonchalantly have his way with her as well.<br /><br />The main mystery (the emotional part) - you could see the end coming a mile away. The financial part of the mystery was okay, but it seemed a little weird for the sociopath Lisbeth to be so socially aware of how to pull off a hoax that the ending was very creaky.<br /><br /> All in all this book is way overblown and way way too long. (A lot of time is spent on the machinations of creepy sub characters).  I gave it two stars because it is nicely written and translated - one for the writing, and one for the translation.  By the way, throughout the book, the author, reveals his love of mysteries by naming assorted American mystery writers.  So it seems assured that the Mr Larsson also read the O'Connell books. Too bad he didn't give her any credit as well.
B00008976Y|5.0|Blue connected with my feelings in film that I could not express in words after the loss of my husband and father of my 2 daughters.  The images reveal feelings too deep for words.  When I reflected on Blue after several months, I thought that it had no words, only images; upon another watching, I discovered how mistaken I was.    I recommend Blue for widows and family members and close friends wanting to understand the feelings of loss through the eyes and heart of a lady.
B0016BWACI|1.0|Am I the only one who noticed that they've edited this film? Just so we're clear, I LOVE this movie; I'm pretty obsessive about it. I've seen it 8 times in the theater (6 when it first came out) and own every single edition on every media platform, including PSP and iTunes. So when I finally sat down to watch the Blu-Ray edition, i noticed pretty quickly that they've changed the dialogue; Jen suddenly speaks a line in Aughra's laboratory that I've never heard.<br /><br />Between this and the edited editions of Erik The Viking and The Last Unicorn, I'm wondering how much of my childhood is left intact. Shame on whoever decided to alter history. It wasn't necessary and this is not what I paid for.

B00008PX8P|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already about this superb release? However, I do have some questions regarding the liveness of the performances. I have found a website detailing edits, song-part dates, etc. [...], but I still have to find information about when and how were the overdubs created. After several viewings, only very recently did I notice that there's a very clear bass guitar on Misty Mountain Hop, from MSG '73, and however talented JPJ is, I simply cannot believe that he was playing it with his feet while playing organ at the same time. Then there's Robert backing himself in Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, Earl's Court '75, and these are just a few of several.<br /><br />I have nothing against this. Knowing how obsessive to detail Jimmy Page can get, I almost expected it and frankly, the result is really good, but I would like to have some information. When were this overdubs made? With dated material or new? Lifted from album outtakes or released tracks? The mind just boggles!!! If anyone has some information about this, please do share.<br /><br />Thanx!
B002NV9AH8|5.0|It's so great to finally be able to \\"hear\\" the gorgeous music on the CD. Tony himself said the original sounded \\"wooly\\", well the wool is gone and this absolutely shines!! 5 stars!
B0034JKZ86|3.0|I haven't watched this movie yet, but my 3 year-old daughter has. She has yet to make it through the entire movie. I've asked her if she wants to finish it, and she doesn't want to. Maybe she's still too young to understand the movie; perhaps in a few more months. She loves the movie \\"Cars\\" and \\"Finding Nemo\\" and has sat through both of those, so I'm not sure if it's the story or lack of action in the movie that has her bored. I'll try showing it to her again in a few months.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is an absolute milestone of anti-establishment cinema.  The performances are nuanced and powerful, the on-location shooting resonates with heat and oppression, and the story and characters exude archetypal impact.  The reviewers who claim that the \\"moral\\" of this film is that people should not assert individuality in prison clearly have no understanding of the word \\"allegory,\\" because in a symbolic sense, the exact point of the film is that the existence of the human spirit depends upon asserting individuality in the face of brutal, institutionally-backed conformity.  As a systematic, hard-headed noncomformist, Newman's Luke is purposefully cast as a savior figure--which is why he's photographed via the iconography of crucifixion after the egg-eating contest, for example--and reviewers who take his character to task for rebelling against the system completely miss the point and go a long way toward demonstrating the very problem the movie works to expose.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Excellent CD.  Best since In Absentia.  I've been following these guys since I saw them open for Yes back in 2002.  The depth and sheer amount of creativity by Stephen Wilson and the group from their earlier stuff to now just boggles the mind.
0452289963|5.0|This is an exceptional book! It has all you need, but unfortunately it is dense and there is a lot of information. It is not for the feint hearted as Tolle does ask a lot of the reader. It is confronting because he maintains that if you do not understand what is written in the pages then you are not ready to grow. Well I suggest you take up the challenge and see if you can understand what he is alluding to. It is worth it! That is why it is called the New Earth. We, as a world need to make some dramatic changes in the way we all interact in order to move forwards in a positive way. This may not be the book for you, there are many others out there. We all have to find what resonates with us, but this book is extremely valuable.  Take it slowly one page at a time and you maybe surprised at what it brings about.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On silver Wings
0393072231|4.0|In \\"The Big Short\\" Michael Lewis outlines the rules of play in this unbelievable new Wall Street game. He titillates our sense of disbelief as he reports on how ordinary stockmarket players knew for months (sometimes years) beforehand that there would be a sub prime financial collapse. Of course the book acts almost as a 'guide' if you are trying to follow (unravel) the present investigations of these Wall Street thieves. As the book carefully leads us through the intricate mental gymnastics needed to create brand new 'plays' in the game of 'Shorting', Michael Lewis ties our brains in knots. For me this became a problem because although Lewis tried to make the fraud clear, these incomprehensible dealings were over my head. I really had to struggle to keep up. But that's because I know very little about the stockmarket, and even less about how some male minds function. That's my problem though so don't let it put you off. The book is timely, it is insightful, it becomes almost a page-turning thriller at times, so I heartily recommend it.
B001BPJJ9G|3.0|Unless you're cool with them seeing people brutally killed, don't show this to say 8 and below. (Edit: the movie is rated R for a reason. I just think the weird violence is *funny*). One black slave gets so many arrows in his back he falls backwards onto the arrows and is propped up like he is laying back on a small table. Another guy slowly falls back onto a sword. Another guy falls to his death and one guy explodes and this all happens while a little girl cries and wishes it all weren't so.<br />If you're in the mood for fantastical tales and adventure maybe check out The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, a most underrated picture. Or Time Bandits.<br />*Spoilers* The movie is about an adorable little girl that is staying in a hospital because she broke her arm and she meets a middle aged dude there that starts telling her stories to get her to get him morphine so he can kill himself. Turns out he's depressed because he fell, hence the title I guess, and is paralyzed the waist down. Plus his girlfriend broke things off with him and is apparently now hooked up with a big Hollywood actor. Bummer. Our suicidal story teller was a stuntman in the movies. The actor playing the suicidal stuntman/story teller and the pudgy little cupcake have chemistry. Love her accent too. That little girl has acting chops.<br /><br />Now as for the story within the story, well the most I can say for it is they really outdid themselves with *real* settings and absolutely gorgeous imagery. The film is breathtaking in some moments. In the stuntman and little girl's tale -because it is her story too- we follow a multi-cultural band consisting of an African, an Indian, Charles Darwin, an explosives expert and a leader based on the little girl's father and then the stuntman, I think. They chase after the bad guy named \\"Odious\\" who is...surprise..the Hollywood big shot that took the stuntman's girl. It is just a fairly drawn out pursuit to get the bad guy. Well, the ending is ho-hum but realistic. And in the yarn our two characters spin I guess it ends the way it has to I guess. He ain't walking again but maybe he wont eat a bunch of Morphine. In addition to being a visually beautiful film (I love the shots of massive sand dunes next to bright blue ocean water..) a nice thing The Fall does convey is the magic of storytelling for small children. It does remind one of experiences as a child of being told stories and that's pretty cool. But hopefully better stories.rn our two characters spin I guess it ends the way it has to I guess.

0451450523|5.0|This is one of my childhood favorites. That being said, it's also one of my favorites to reread, and hasn't yet gotten old.  Look somewhere else if you want a happy-go-lucky fairytale, where the witch is evil, and the hero is good, and everything is painted out in black and white. This follows in the vein of a more realistic fairytale, and compares with books such as Charles De Lint's Jack the Giant Killer. Instead of a multicolored Oz, Dorothy finds herself in a more muted fairyworld, where every color is a shade of grey.  Personally, I think it makes for a much more realistic tale, and appeals more to an older crowd, who can understand that fantasy does not necessarily have to be lit up in neon pixie lights for it to be fantastic.  If you can appreciate something outside the mainstream? I would definitely give this book a read. I promise, it will become a favorite.

0393324818|5.0|This is a book I just couldn't put down, usually reserved for a good piece of fiction.  But Michael Lewis' in-depth account of the paradigm shift coming to baseball in America is a fascinating story of a few individuals challenging conventional wisdom and, in an unorthodox way, building a winning team from castoffs and unlikely heroes.  The cast of real-life characters is central to the story itself, from Bill James to Billy Beane.  The results are also very real; the Oakland A's prove a low budget operation can consistently produce winning teams.  I've since started tracking the A's just to watch the genius revealed.

B001974DG0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books.  I think it's actually Koontz's best and I've read all of his books to date.  I immediately fell in love with the dog, Einstein.  You actually end up thinking of him as a human character.  The book is full of suspense and the ending is great as well.
030745455X|5.0|This book got me in trouble, I bought it at the airport because I forgot to bring a book and once i started I couldn't put it down, to the point where my husband got so curious that he decided to read it too and he loved it. I was reading it til 3 am. Loved it.
B002ZFQD04|4.0|Sticky & Sweet Tour was amazing tour, but you can't feel it in this dvd. The editing of the dvd is nothing new... look's like Confessions tour.. the same thing. Behind the scenes of the tour is a great thing, i enjoy it so much. So, the DVD is ok. But the CD is terrible. The songs in it, not the best of the concert. Why don't give to us a doble cd with the whole concert? I buy it only cause i'm a big fan of Madonna and i went to this concert. But the couldn't capture all the emotion and the exciting of the tour. BAD EDITING

B000BBOV8U|4.0|Most people probably have forgotten the song \\"Diana\\" which, I believe, was written as a smitten love song for Princess Di.  Absolutely great song that was only put out on an EP.  Probably one of his best rockers ever.
B000001GK9|5.0|Any too poor (or cheap) to shell out quite this much for one cd, who nonetheless feel the force of all the critical praise, should look out for the Gramophone Awards Collection edition (same (live) recording), which may be available on Amazon.UK.
0810983915|5.0|Thanks for allowing me to say a few words about Amazon and the things I order.  Since I live at a distance from grandchildren and great grandchildren, when they want something \\"from Mama Len's Store\\" they give me a call.  They have to tell me (1) Name of the book, (2) Where they learned about it (3) If it's a series...  (*the same goes for dvds).<br /><br />One of the things I love about Amazon is that I can go look for what the kids (or my adult kids for that matter) have mentioned they'd like to have and put it in my basket.  Then I work through that and never have to worry about what to get anyone.  It works well for me, and Amazon has never deleted my basket items like so many other webstores do.<br /><br />My 8 year old grandson LOVES the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" series.  Thanks to them being color coordinated I was able to keep the books in sequence and he only received one of each.  The down side is that he reads them in an evening! ha.  He's now waiting for the movie...<br /><br />I've been ordering from Amazon about 4 or 5 years with this little system and I have yet to be disappointed.  That bodes well in today's environment and  rude store clerks!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />The Mamma<br />Texas

B0027B80U2|4.0|This was a fascinating story. I knew Lincoln is considered a great man, but a genius? Now I know he was. He used those who would have defeated him in his bid for the White House to help him run this country at a critical time. Those who would have used him he deflected with grace and tact. He appointed men the army had no use for to run the army. Grant who had been forced to resign from the army. Sherman who the newspapers would accuse of being insane. But Lincoln saw in them the leaders they would become. Read this book or listen to the cds as I did and you will gain a greater understanding of the man, his time, and his legend.

0393072231|4.0|I was a big fan of Moneyball and this story parallels it but within a world gone mad rather than on a baseball diamond.  Just like Moneyball this book follows a few Billy Beanes who like him have a world view that is both contrarian and revolutionary.  Initially ignored and sometimes thought of as fools they stick to their world view and in the end are proclaimed right.  Interestingly they tend to be quirky characters with personal traits that make them social misfits.  It's an interesting read and Michael Lewis provides some commentary throughout that to me seems very astute.  The best part of the book is that it does so much better in explaining CDOs and CDSs then most other reads.  Not enough to buy or sell one but at least understand them conceptually to have a more intelligent opinion on them.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Fast paced, riveting, suspensefull. I throughlly enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. Kidman and Jackman are great and the rest of the cast are equally as good.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|This 2-Disc set is worth every penny. Of course the movie is great but this also includes an extra DVD of the making of the movie as well and the original play. Contains great interviews with Andrew Lloyd Webber and the casts and crews of both. This is a great one to have in your collection.
B002ZTIILC|5.0|I have listened to Marina since her debuts.  I appreciate her vulnerability and her ability to dramatically express the various tragedies and comedies of life through her music.  Marina is fastly rising to the top.  She is brilliant and creative to the core.  Multiple talents and class ooze out of each song.  I have delighted in the poetry, and the common threads developing through the sequence of presentation.  Even though I am 30 years her senior, I find that I have been swept into the emotion that each song evicts.  I won't even venture to guess who she sounds like, as I am not familiar with much of today's pop music.  My entire family enjoys her music, because she is creative and genuine to the core.  May she rise to the top and stay there for a very long time! She is most delightful and insightful.
0316044938|5.0|What a page turner!  Loved the concept of a child looking down from heaven, and seeing the events of her families life as they deal with her murder.  I almost tossed the book out, when I first started reading about her murder. It was just not the type of story that I normally would read.
B002UXRH10|3.0|I like Rihanna and have all of her previous cds. I was looking forward to getting this one but was disaappointed upon listening to the whole cd. The best song on the cd is \\"rude boy\\" in my opinion. The other songs are okay but didn't impress me.
B0036EH3TS|1.0|I have mixed feelings about the movie on blue-ray.     On one hand I was really dissapointed that the blu-ray version of the film had cut the extra scenes from the Criterion DVD version of the movie. The scene where Willis visits his father explains the \\"God gave us children so we would have roses in winter.\\" With the storage capacity of blu-ray the only reason I can think of for them leaving out the extra footage is they want to package another blu-ray verison later and get us for another $20-$30.    On the other hand the sound and picture were great, but not enough (IMHO) to warrant purchasing it in blue-ray if you already own the DVD version.
B0036T31YY|5.0|This is a fresh and fantastic mind-bending story that is logically put together with a clever and very interesting ending.  It will certainly leave you thinking.  I loved the fact it was a supernatural movie without a lot of blood.  No haunting, no slashing, just a good use of sea atmosphere horror with a refreshing twist.  Great acting, especially Melissa George, she really carried this movie with great talent and impressed me.  And in my opinion there were no loop holes that you can't pretty much figure out yourself. It's a very believable story minus the supernatural events of course.  This is my newest favorite movie and I am definitely adding this to my movie collection. I encourage anybody to watch it even if you don't like supernatural thrillers.
B000MV8ZD6|5.0|\\"The House By The Cemetery\\" is one great horror flick.  The story is well-told and not too hard to grasp:  Dr. Fraudstein from the early 20th Century performed deranged human experiments whereby cells only regenerate through the consumption or application of human flesh.  Now in the latter 20th Century, a research Professor wants to investigate the work of a Dr. Peterson who was initially interested in Dr. Fraudstein's work...a chain reaction of interest of sorts.  Research doc and his family move into Dr. Fraudstein's house and all hell breaks loose.    The gore was right on target...a true gorefest, which is what I love in horror films.  No slow parts at all to the movie either.  It held my interest throughout, and I wouldn't hesitate to give this a second viewing.  Such a rare gem of a film!
0061922315|5.0|I just finished this book and genuinely loved it.  Characters were well developed, and by the end I truly felt I knew them and felt their pain and joys.  The story masterfully wove together the stories of families in the United States and India.  I wasn't sure what it would be like for someone who has never been to India, and the descriptions were so vivid and beautiful that I could feel being there.      I think the author did an outstanding job, and I look forward to her next effort!

Happy Xmas( War is over)...Makes me realize, how fortunate I am and  and thus a more humble and tolerant person...  Feliz Navidad...Jose Feliciano must be very proud on how Celine handled  his song!  I had to get up and dance...Oh yeah, that's how good it's done!!!
B0027CSNBM|5.0|(Dictated by my 9-year old son).  The Demigod Files is one of the best books about Greek Mythology.

However, the Lightening Thief and the Last Olympian are still better.  I recommend people to buy this book especially if your Family member pays for it!  It was a good value.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|What can I add?<br /><br />I caught this movie on TV, and was so charmed by it, I decided to add it to my Wish List, and luckily, a dear friend bought it for me.<br /><br />It's just a nice little positive movie to pick up your spirits.  The acting is wonderful, and the stars bring their skill and charm and the characters to life.  Hugh Grant is at his most charming, but the other actors are perfectly cast and bring this charming story to life.<br /><br />Alan Rickman was so subtle and perfect, his scene calling the girl about the Christmas gift?  Perfect.  Ditto Emma Thompson after receiving the CD instead of the jewelry, breaking down, and then courageously pulling it together for the kids.  Just perfection.<br /><br />Yes, it shows on TV occasionally, but in an edited version.  Watching the uncut movie was much better.  It's a great gift to someone you love, and the ending still makes me misty.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis does an excellent job of helping me understand what a CDO is and why it was so stupid to invent such an instrument.  If you wonder do we need banking reform in the US, the answer is clearly descibed in this book.  The Senate hearings with Goldman Saks are but the tip of the iceberg of all that went on.  But the big revelation for me was why the US government had to bailout AIG for the sake of the Earth's financial stability.

B002WY65W4|5.0|I love zombie movies. I liked all the old Romero movies, and grew up watching the Evil Dead movies. My previous favorite zombie movie was the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Shaun of the Dead was a close second, and the best funny zombie movie ever... until now. Zombieland works on so many levels. Not only is it a great zombie flick, it's an entertaining comedy, and a thoughtfuly story. Woddy Harrelson gives one of the best performances of his career here, and he is perfectly cast for his character. Jesse Eisenberg is great as the star/narrarator and gives the movie it's amateurish feel. I do not feel like I'm watching a movie when I see this, I feel like I'm in a movie. It's one of the most engrossing films I've seen in a long time. Whether you're a fan of zombie movies or not, I would highly recommend you check this movie out as it is very entertaining and has a wonderful cast.

193413712X|4.0|An old man, lying on his deathbed, somehow remembers the highlights of not just his life but that of his father's.  Paul Harding's beautifully-written book has received high praise from many readers.  What I liked most were the glimpses of a forgotten age, when the only mode of transportation was by horse or on foot, when epilepsy was mistaken for mental illness and could get a man committed to an asylum, when poverty was common, but people took their hand-to-mouth existence in stride, and when the grid was so highly localized, a man could simply walk away from one life and start another in a different town under a new name.  I've seen movies and read other books taking place during this period, but I've never felt as drawn in as I did when reading Tinkers.    Joe
B002VECM72|5.0|It takes a special kind of person to go against the tides of prejudice and preconceived ideas of what is considered social norms, particularly in the South. Yet this well-connected, fairly wealthy Southern white family adopts an odd acting homeless black kid, 'no questions asked.' No sibling jealousy arises, in fact the young son becomes a mentor for the new family member and the daughter takes it all in stride. Sandra Bullock does a wonderful job portraying a \\"modernized\\" Southern Belle. The nice thing is that what seems to be a contrived Hollywood fairy tale is actually true!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Great CD + DVD collection for all of the Madge fans. I actually regret not seeing the tour when she came to Chicago because Madonna is a great performer! Anyway, the tour is in support of her album [[ASIN:B0015D3Z4O Hard Candy]] and divided into four acts: Pimp, Old Skool, Gypsy, & Rave. Madonna and her dancers seemed to have so much fun on stage (if they weren't, they're really convincing!). The stage has two giant M's on both sides, 5 jumbo LCD screens, and a runway very reminiscent of the [[ASIN:B000KGGLCU The Confessions Tour - Live from London (CD+DVD)]] with an LCD curtain. Here's the setlist:   DVD  ACT 1: Pimp  1. The Sweet Machine (Video Intro)  2. Candy Shop - Madonna emerges from a rotating LCD screen on a throne (very similar to the Hard Candy Promo Tour performance)  3. The Beat Goes On   4. Human Nature - Madge sings this classic with backdrops of Britney Spears trapped in an elevator  5. Vogue - a great performance!! The song is mashed to the backing music of [[ASIN:B00171NTU4 4 Minutes]] as Madonna sings this anthem for the first time! Madonna and her dancers complete a dance routine at the end of the runway.  6. Die Another Day (Remix) [Video Interlude] - a fast pace remix of DAD that features dancers on stage in a boxing ring (sound effects are from [[ASIN:B000000GSQ Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]])  ACT 2: Old Skool - Madonna and her dancers are dressed in old skool street atire  7. Into The Groove - Madonna and her dancers are double dutch jumping rope to this classic. Madge reinvents the song by mashing it up with Jump on it by Apache, Double Dutch Bus, and Toop Toop.   8. Heartbeat - Madge peforms as a puppet while her dancers guide her. Also the runway reveals a conveyor belt!  9. Borderline (Rock Version) - Madge plays one of her early singles on an electric guitar and performs with her band!   10. She's Not Me - hilarious performance with backdrops from her earlier videos.   11. Music - great performance as the song is mashed with [[ASIN:B000JFY0S4 Put Your Hands Up for Detroit]].  12. Rain (Remix) [Video Interlude] - the song is mashed with [[ASIN:B001RYYYYQ Here Comes The Rain Again/Paint A Rumour]] with a video of a pixie finding shed in rain. Also features two Japanese dancers dressed in kimono and hakama!   ACT 3: Gypsy  13. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You - Madge wears a black cloak and performs on top of a piano while the video curtain displays water and rain pouring.   14. Spanish Lesson - cool performance with a some flamenco dance moves.  15. Miles Away - my favorite song from Hard Candy. Madonna plays the guitar and sing with backdrops of different countries.   16. La Isla Bonita - this performance incorporates a Ukranian folk band called the Kolpakov Trio with a song called Lela Pala Tute.  17. Doli Doli - the Kolpakov Trio performs while Madge and her dancers take shots.  18. You Must Love Me - Madonna sings while the Kolpakov Trio performs with her  19. Don't Cry For Me Argentina - an Argentina only performance and a great addition to the setlist! The Buenos Aires crowd goes wild!!  20. Get Stupid (Video Interlude) - an interlude very reminiscent of the Sorry (Remix) video interlude from the Confessions Tour.   ACT 4: Rave  21. 4 Minutes - Madge performs a virtual duet with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake while sporting football chest pads. The performance is similar to the Hard Candy Promo Tour.   22. Like A Prayer - a great high energy paced performance of another classic! The song is remixed with a trance feel!  23. Ray of Light - the performance was okay for me. Similar to the Confessions Tour performance.   24. Like A Virgin (Request song) - Madge sings a capella with the crowd.   25. Hung Up (Rock Version) - Madonna performs this hit on the electric guitar similar to the Hard Candy Promo Tour.   26. Give It 2 Me (Jody Den Broeder Remix) - I was actually surprised that she performed a dance remix of this song! Great performance and great way to end the show!!  Overall, the DVD is great and shows just how spectacular the show was. Here's the CD tracklist:  1. Candy Shop  2. Beat Goes On  3. Human Nature  4. Vogue  5. She's Not Me  6. Music  7. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You  8. Spanish Lesson  9. La Isla Bonita  10. You Must Love Me  11. Get Stupid  12. Like A Prayer  13. Give It 2 Me  note: if you order the Amazon Digital Deluxe Version of the album, you get 4 bonus tracks: Borderline, Miles Away, 4 Minutes, and Ray of Light.

0375836675|5.0|I first read Markus Zusak's \\"The Book Thief,\\" and it gained an immediate spot in my top twenty books of all time.  I then ordered \\"The Messenger,\\" and while it wasn't on a par with \\"The Book Thief,\\" it is a book that I heartily recommend to all readers from about age 14 on up.  Zusak has a marvelous ability to create characters that you care about, regardless of their foibles and sometimes errant ways.  You root for these people as you would a close friend.  He's a master at getting inside the heads of the people who populate his stories; creating unique characters who never lose their edge.  This book is about life choices; ambition; love; respect; and character.  I wanted to get to the end to see how things shook out, but I didn't want the book to end.      A further note:  After completing this read, I got \\"Getting the Girl,\\" and was again drawn into the worlds of new characters, grappling with sibling rivalry and life.  Zusak will be on the best seller list for years to come.  Read him.
0553582038|5.0|I think people are forgetting that these books are about the world of Westeros and not just individual characters. Yes the characters obviously help advance the story but they are not the focus. It's the entire world of A Song of Ice and Fire. All your lovable characters will be back in ADWD. This book gives us a chance to see the rest of the cast which I think is fascinating. I think it's great in this book how George gives us a view of places we havent seen yet. And for all you people complaining, GET OVER IT! He's a writer. We're quirky people by nature and usually move to our own beat. This man has a life and he will finish the books in his own time. If you don't like it stop reading, but you know you'll be back.

030745455X|3.0|I had a problem with this book-it was printed incorrectly so that Chapter 24 and chapter 25 were inserted where Chapter 8 and 9 should have been so I missed those two chapters and read the end of the story at Chap 8 which turned out to be very confusing and revealed some of the surprise ending very soon in the book.  Otherwise a very inventive and edge of the seat novel, very well constructed.  Started out very technical and boring but got exciting very fast and stayed that way throughout the whole book.  Highly recommend but be sure it is printed correctly.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I saw Avatar twice in Imax 3D and once in standard 2D, and the 2D looked pretty weak so I had some concerns about the quality of the blu-ray disc visuals.  I should't have been concerned, the movie is stunning (MUCH better than the theater 2D experience), and this is on a 32\\" 720p HD LCD.  For 20 bucks how can you go wrong?  It costs five dollars more at the local W*****t.<br />I knew there weren't going to be any special features (it really wasn't all that hard to do a little homework in advance) and like many other reviewers I didn't care.  In the past when I've watched how the CGI effects were done it took some of the fun out of the movie.<br />I just wanted the best possible home experience I could get without 3D and I wasn't disappointed.  Simple plot?  Well yeah, but again, who cares?  There is still a meaningful message with lots of incredible visuals and fun action scenes --- a great escape movie (when I want more substance I watch something like \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\").<br />If you really need the extras then wait for that release, but if all you want is a fun movie beautifully rendered then this is the one to get.
B002RSDW80|4.0|This is a delightful, funny, heartwarming, and charming movie. I resisted it for quite a while. Saying to me, \\"Hey, it's Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in a Nora Ephron fim about female empowerment, romance, and fulfillment in two different centuries!\\" is not a way to get me into a theater. \\"Hey, it's about a blogger!\\" is also not a way to get me into a theater. After all, I'm a blogger myself, and I have to think that watching a movie about me working on my blog would be only slightly less boring that watching an experimental film about bread rising.<br /><br />But this film is about Julia Child. And I love Julia Child. Or at least, I love her cookbook. I've had Mastering the Art of French Cooking as one of my basic cooking books for years. It's the go-to source for all of the basic techniques of food creation. In my opinion, you can just remove the word \\"French\\" from the title of the book. Almost everything in the book is the basics of how to cook good food. Julia teachs how to hold a knife. How to slice every kind of vegetable. How to prepare every type of meat. What the various types of basic sauces are, and how to make them.<br /><br />I've absorbed so much of what Julia teaches in the book, that when I describe a recipe that I've created or tweaked on my own, I will frame it in terms of techniques from the book. \\"Well, first, you start with a basic Julia Child White Sauce, the cream version that's in the Sauces chapter, and then...\\"<br /><br />Julie and Julia is a story of two different people in two different centuries, linked together across time by a love of cooking and writing. The \\"Julie\\" of the story is Julie Powell (Amy Adams), a modern-day woman just turning thirty. She lives in a small Queens (New York City) apartment with her husband Eric (Chris Messina), and works at a grinding government cubicle job, answering phone calls from angry members of the public. She's foundering in life; her dreams of being a writer are slowly fading away, and she feels increasingly that only the strength of her loving husband keeps her going. She needs a change. She needs a project. And so, in late 2002, she decides that her project will consist of cooking every single recipe in Julia Child's seminal cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, over the period of exactly one year. And she will write a blog about the entire process, and how it changes her life.<br /><br />The \\"Julia\\" in the story is, of course, Julia Child. The film begins in 1949 as Julia and her diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in France, to begin a four-year assignment there. While Paul is busy at his new job, Julia tries desperately to find something to keep her busy. She begins taking French lessons. She tries her hand at learning how to make hats. She learns how to get around Paris, and enjoys shopping and the markets. Every night, she and Paul eat a fabulous French dinner at a different restaurant. One night, Paul tells her to do whatever it is that she likes most. \\"I like to eat!\\" she says. And right then and there, she decides to enter culinary school and become a chef.<br /><br />Although Julie and Julia never meet, their stories parallel each other. The film works by cutting back and forth every ten minutes or so between the two characters and the two different time periods. Julia Child becomes a chef, and then, with the help of two other female French chefs, decides to write the ultimate English language book of how to cook in the French style. We watch her struggles and triumphs over the decade it takes to bring the book to life and finally see it published to glowing reviews. We pass through a variety of different diplomatic posts for the Childs, until the McCarthy era puts an end to their style of open and casual diplomacy.<br /><br />Back in 2002, we watch Julie Powell as she works her way through Julia's book, now in its 47th printing. Her daily blog postings become more and more famous. The New York Times writes an article about her efforts. And Judith Jones - the still-living publisher who approved Julia Child's book nearly fifty years ago - schedules a visit to see how she's doing.<br /><br />The whole movie is done in a bright, cheery, almost whimsical style that suits the story matter perfectly. Meryl Streep, always wonderful, is awesome as Julia Child. Although the modern parts of the movie are fine and dandy for what they are, it's the period pieces set in France of the 1950's that are the heart of this film. I also have to give a special shout-out to Jane Lynch (currently famous as evil cheerleader coach Sue Sylvester on Glee), who plays Julia's sister Dorothy to perfection.<br /><br />It's a happy movie, and I won't keep you in suspense: It has a happy ending. Julie Powell ends up turning her blog into a book, which becomes this movie. And Julia Child does get her french cooking book published, which becomes a best-seller, leading to her becoming a TV star on the long-running cooking show The French Chef.r who approved Julia Child's book nearly fifty years ago - schedules a visit to see how she's doing.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This award-winning documentary along with the documentary \\"King Corn\\" had a profound effect on me and has permanently changed my lifestyle and diet. I am not a counter-culture, idealistic college student--I am a retired college professor who was in the health professions my entire career. What has happened to our food supply as a result of providing \\"abundant cheap food\\" in the U.S. since 1973 is eyeopening and a wake-up call to each of us regarding what we eat and support through our food dollars as individuals and as a nation. \\"Our bodies are not just what we eat but what we eat, eats\\". The control of U.S. agriculture by a very few large agribusiness companies; limiting the number of crops grown and varieties; the modification of seeds and trademarking life forms has implications that could prove diasterous not only to us but the entire world's food supply.    Organic foods and sustainable farming offers people an option to purchase and eat foods which are not loaded with pesticide and herbicide residues; to eat and drink dairy products, eggs and meat animals that are not loaded with growth hormones to spur production and to put weight on quickly to maximize profits of the huge companies; to decrease the potential of causing \\"superbugs\\" resistant to antibiotics caused by the administration of continuous antibiotics to keep food animals alive under unnatural and horrific conditions being fed #2 field corn (which they would never eat if allowed a normal life before slaughter for food.) Cattle evolved to eat grass, not grain and the effects on the animal are known but ignored--our beef today contains only 60% of the protein it contained in the mid 1950s thanks to meat packers wanting the highly marbled (read fat)beef. Fish farmers are even trying to get salmon and tilapia to accept #2 field corn feed. The high fructose corn syrup and other products from #2 field corn are in almost all of our grocery products on the market--even those items we do not think of as beingsweet. I no longer wonder why people have such a hard time losing weight when most of us eat a diet loaded with hormones given to animals to put on weight quickly and high fructose corn syrup in almost everything we eat.    The U.S. government does not allow genetically-modified food to be labelled; as a result a number of European countries will no longer import certain foods from the U.S. since they require the labelling of genetic modification to grains, fruits and vegetables.  No one (no one) knows the long term effects of using bacteria and viruses to introduce foreign genes from other species into food we eat.    The health risks and costs of \\"abundant cheap food\\"---what it has done to small family farms that did not go along with big agribusiness practices; the requirement of more and more pesticides which may be partially responsible for the abandonment of hives and death of thousands of our pollinators esp. the honey bee. Principles of organic farming which enriches the soil, is better for the farmer, farm animals and us is more expensive than what most of us have been eating everyday.  As a consumer and someone concerned about the implications of standard, modern agricultural practices, I am willing to pay more for the farmer to farm organically--I support fair-trade and believe the farmer and his family need to be to support themselves and their way of life.    As a result of the documentaries my diet is now as much organic as possible; I no longer eat beef, pork, chickens, dairy or eggs produced by the big food processors. I now read labels on the food products I buy to make sure I am not ingesting sweeteners made from #2 field corn. I try to buy wild, Alaskan salmon rather than farmed or Atlantic salmon. I believe my diet is now more nutritious and tastier than ever before.  My granddaughter has her master's degree in nutrition and she and her parents have also made changes in their diet from the belief that they will be healthier.    I recommend thisdocumentary and \\"King Corn\\" to anyone interested in their health and nutrition.
B001DHE9KG|1.0|i'm sure to be hated for not liking this - but i did not care for it At All.    Carmen, however, when the 'Live from the Met' DVD comes out will be 1 i will be sure to buy.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|Even if you don't have a 5.1 surround-sound setup to hear the DVD mix, the stereo remix done by Wilson and Fripp is a huge improvement over the original.  Instruments that were inexplicably \\"up-front\\" have been descretely pushed back, stereo placement has been refined, and one can now hear the whole ensemble playing in the more convoluted moments.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that he had a hand on the board for the remix, Fripp's guitar can finally be heard distinctly in the middle passages of the Lizard suite.  I own a number of \\"remixes\\" of \\"classic\\" albums from the 1970s, but this is the first one where I can honestly say that there is a major improvement over the original.  This is absolutely worth buying, even if you already have an intact copy of the original Lizard on CD (as I do). I hope that Wilson and Fripp continue in this vein with other \\"difficult\\" Crimson albums like Islands and Larks Tongues in Aspic, as opposed to the recent 40th anniversary \\"Red\\", which is good but hardly transformational.
0307266303|5.0|I have been running for years.  I usually liked it, but I often felt like it was only a means to an end - keeping weight off.  And I had my moments of aches and pains and injuries.    This book absolutely changed my outlook. After reading this, I completely agree that we are \\"born to run\\"!  Many don't believe that.  But Chris' anaylsis makes sense.  I also used to prefer running more on my forefoot but \\"thought\\" it was wrong so I tried to run with a heel strike.  And when I ran with a heel strike, that was usually when the aches and pains started.  Which then led me to believe that I needed better shoes! Now I believe that what I preferred all along - forefoot running is best!  I will never buy expensive running shoes again (I may even pull out my old beat-up shoes again).  My next venture is to try the Five Fingers! I have truly fallen in love with running!    I originally got this book at the library but am buying it to read again and again!!!!!!!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Not so much long awaited (as the film was playing in theaters up to a week ago) but with the release of AVATAR to DVD the public fascination with the film increases. Already the DVD is setting sales records much like the film did at the box office. So is the movie worth adding to your collection or watching? Sure. But it's not near as good as some people thought.<br /><br />Set in the future, the story revolves around Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), an ex-Marine whose legs no longer work. Jake's brother was to be part of a scientific expedition to the planet of Pandora. To discover more about the planet, Jake's brother was part of an experiment where his own DNA was combined with that of the planet's native inhabitants, the Na `vi. This cloned body or avatar would be linked to him via equipment in the lab enabling him to see, touch, and feel everything the avatar did. But he died prior to heading out, thus presenting Jake with the opportunity to take his place since they shared DNA.<br /><br />Upon arriving, Jake finds himself a fish out of water. Not quite still a Marine as he is wheel chair bound, he's also not taken in right off the bat by the scientific group either, especially by the head scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) who views him as a dimwitted Marine. But he'll have to do and the link is made. Jake is ecstatic about the chance to walk, run, to feel his feet once more and it appears he just might work.<br /><br />At the same time Jake has been recruited by the top Marine commander on the planet, Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Quaritch wants Jake to get more intel on the Na'vi and the layout of the land where they live. In return he guarantees Jake he'll put a word in to get him a new pair of legs.<br /><br />It seems that the Marines and the corporate sponsor of the entire expedition are there for one reason. The planet of Pandora has a reservoir of a rare ore known as unobtanium (couldn't they have come up with a better name than this?), worth millions for a single ounce. But the biggest location of this ore is right under the main base of the Na' vi. It seems the scientific group wants to learn more about the people and work with them while the evil corporate big shot and the Marines want to simply destroy them, get them out of the way and take the ore.<br /><br />Jake heads out on his first mission but ends up lost from the rest of the group. Alone and in the jungle, he nearly becomes a meal for the local animals but is saved by a female Na `vi named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). A sign from the planet's deity causes Neytiri to take an interest in Jake and to help him on this new world as a Na `vi.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Jake supplies the information to Quaritch that he desires but begins to change with each passing day. Not only does he begin to take an interest in Neytiri, he also begins to see the Na `vi as the people they are, learning more about their heritage and beliefs. And when the Marines begin to move in to destroy the main source of their beliefs, Home Tree, Jake must decide whether he is going to do what he has been ordered or do the right thing.<br /><br />The movie is a breathtaking experience to see. It is a beautiful combination of colors and visuals that make you feel as if you're truly seeing another planet that actually exists. For this and this alone, the movie should be seen and appreciated. Not only did visual effects artists create a new world for all to see, they also created the Na `vi as well. Yes, the 8 foot tall, blue skinned aliens are all computer generated and completely believable.<br /><br />The only problem with the movie is that with all of this technology, one would think they would have thought to make a deeper film with less simple plotline that was less political pandering and more story oriented. As another reviewer I read put it, the film is like watching DANCES WITH WOLVES set in outer space.<br /><br />The simplest idea put forward with this film is that all corporations and military people are bad and that all indigenous people are good; technology is bad and nature is good. Kind of an odd thing to say in a movie made from some of the most high tech available out there. In this film world, there is no common ground, there is no gray area. It's all black and white, good and evil. As I said, an overly simplistic look at environmental issues.<br /><br />The film does offer some great action and high adventure. It does present a great science fiction film, a genre that gets less attention than it deserves. But for all the hoopla the movie could have been better. Will you watch it more than once? Certainly. But not as much for the story being told as for the visual world of Pandora you will encounter.<br /><br />As has been stated by many others here, this DVD release is as bare bones as one can get. Just the movie folks. Rumor has already leaked that a special edition will be seen in the near future. So if you're a fan of the movie, pick it up now. But if you're looking for extended versions, commentary tracks or the like, hang on and just rent this time around.people are good; technology is bad and nature is good.

B000ZELISO|4.0|This is a great BD, and I enjoy the movie.  I am reviewing the BD as such, however, and pointing out the MAJOR flaw of my BD: the sound quality is poor.  In fact, I have to turn up the volume so high on my big screen TV/amplification system, it is ridiculous.  Is this a common complaint?  I don't know.  Perhaps my BD is flawed.  I have numerous BD's in my library, and I've never come across this problem.
B0033AGPEE|5.0|While I love the music on the album, my main objection is the way it was marketed. It was made to look like this was a concerted effort for Jimi to record a new album as a follow up to Electric Ladyland. That isn't exactly true. Also,if you have some of the live albums the remakes of previously released songs is a bit redundant because as good as these are they pale next to the live versions. As for the rest of the songs. They have all been available on bootlegs for many years. What is great is finally being able to hear fully mixed & mastered versions in, with the vinyl version at least, stunning fidelity. These songs literally jump out from your speakers! In conclusion: this album is more than worth having as long as you aren't looking for any major revelation. It fills in some blanks but doesn't make you reimagine Jimi's catalogue
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer's first album \\"Show No Mercy\\" shows the band as being very promising right from the getgo. Fast, evil riffs mixed with near-anarchic drumming, Tom's signature vocals, dark and horror-inspired lyrics and chaotic guitar solos. Although Slayer was known more for the sound they came up with during \\"Reign In Blood\\", I really love the sound of this album and their next one, \\"Hell Awaits\\". Both of these albums showcase an early black metal/ death metal style mixed with the band's Bay Area thrash sound. I don't know why they didn't write more material like this, but I am glad to have the amount of material in this style they already put down.<br />\\"Evil Has No boundaries\\" reminds me of a Slayer-styled \\"Hit the Lights\\", the first song on Metallica's \\"Kill 'Em All\\". This song is fast, evil, energetic, and a lot of fun; it's the kind of song that you want to blast while going crazy fast in your car on a Friday night. \\"The Antichrist\\" has an awesome, pentatonic riff and some of Tom's most sinister vocals on the album. \\"Crionics\\" is a personal favorite of mine by the band, and is quite unique: melodic, galloping riffs, sci-fi lyrics, and a very progressive songwriting style, a great song to play at night. \\"The Final Command\\" kicks off with a fast and smooth riff that's as catchy as it is dark, before the rest of the song explodes in with the classic Slayer energy. \\"Show No Mercy\\" kicks off with some great drumming by the legendary Dave Lombardo before the rest of the band comes in and rounds off this classic album, going out with a bang. The rest of the album is, of course, incredible as well.<br /><br />Overall, this might be my personal favorite Slayer album, it's a bunch of dark, evil, horror-inspired thrash-metal fun. Be sure to get it and crank it loud! Thanks for the time, and peace.

0446677450|1.0|I read this book many years ago and I can agree with some of the concepts he teaches... However, buyer beware that this book is little more than the same kind of gimmick that lures people into multi-level marketing schemes all the time - it promises to teach you how to get rich without working a job the rest of your life.  The truth is that it is a gateway into sucking you into buying more and more and more of the author's products and services. Just like multi-level marketing, most of the money to be made is the money made by those peddling the products promising to teach you how to get rich quick.  Don't buy into it.

I imagine this album tells me a little bit about what a late-night back-porch session with Muddy Waters was like.  Dixon, James and Guy supply that rarest of commodities, silence.  It's like good Italian food: only the finest ingredients, minimally processed and dished up hot.  It could be subtitled \\"The Triumph of Taste Over Virtuosity\\".

B000IFQLLY|2.0|I remember the conflicts between the fans of Depeche Mode and the fans of Erasure about which band was the best.<br /><br />The answer is tantalizingly simple. None of them were. They were both crap.<br /><br />Weirdly, both bands were created by the same person, Vince Clark. But then, Mr. Clark also formed two good bands, Yazoo (Yaz) and The Assembly.<br /><br />Thank goodness.<br /><br />As for Depeche Mode, their beat was recently pilfered by Lady Gaga. They used to be so famous. Now, their music is used as background by a crazy trannie doing euro-disco. Fitting punishment!<br /><br />PS. On balance, I think Erasure was better.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Screaming for Vengeance is without a doubt one of the world's greatest Heavy Metal albums ever created, proving once again that the mighty Judas Priest are the Metal Gods of Heavy Metal. I don't know how they did it but the Priest just kept cranking out great album after great album over the years, and this one may just be their greatest ever.<br /><br />The musical onslaught starts out strong with The Hellion/Electric Eye which assaults you with a blast of those amazing trademark twin guitars and monster beats accompanied by Halford's amazing vocals singing \\"Up here in space, I'm looking down on you, My lasers trace, Everything you do.\\" This song is one of Judas Priest's most popular songs and a known concert staple, but that is only the beginning.<br /><br />The next song is Riding on the Wind, an epic song just made for blaring loud while riding a Harley down the Highway. The cool mechanical bird on the album's cover (The Hellion) also comes to mind here as well.<br /><br />Next is Bloodstone which is another great song, (Take these) Chains, Pain and Pleasure, and the superb title song, Screaming for Vengeance. And scream Halford does like a banshee. I just love it when he hits those high notes in this song, \\"Screeeaaaminnnnnnng for vengeance!\\" It gives me chills every time I hear it. And those amazing killer guitar riffs from Glenn Tipton, K.K. Downing and Ian Hill are unmatched excellence.<br /><br />And just when you think it can't get any better, it does with the mega hit song, You've Got Another Thing Comin'. This is one of Judas Priest's most popular songs ever recorded. I can still remember back in the Hey Day of MTV in the early Eighties when this album was first released and viewing the video for this song which was played over and over again. It was always a highlight for me and my friends when it was shown, as all eyes were always glued to the screen when it would air, without fail.<br /><br />The album comes to an end with yet even two more great tunes, the fantastic Fever, and the awesome closer, Devil's Child. Damn, this album is literally a greatest hits compilation! There is no filler here, folks. Every song is a winner. In my review for Judas Priest's British Steel album, I title it Judas Priest's Greatest Hits Volume 1. Well, this one may as well be called Judas Priest's Greatest Hits Volume 2. It's that good.<br /><br />I know it's been said to the point of redundancy, but it's the truth...Judas Priest are the reigning Metal Gods of Heavy Metal and this album proves it once again.<br /><br />Standout Tracks are : ALL OF THEM.closer, Devil's Child.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|we have an UppaBaby Vista which does not have come with a beverage holder. The UppaBaby branded one is over $20, which seems overpriced to me. I found this on amazon for under $10 and it has been a great buy. We use it to hold a water bottle, hand sanitizer, burp cloths, my wife's wallet, keys, etc. Very handy and improved on the one area that the Vista was lacking. People have actually come up to us in our local baby store and asked where we got it since they were also about to buy the Vista. Totally worth the price and very very useful. The velcro straps make it adjustable to just about any handle. Highly reccomend.
B001FB55N0|3.0|The movie took forever to get to my house. Standard delivery does't take over 3 weeks. The payment went through quick so I don't know why it took so long.
0743454537|2.0|It was extremely disturbing. It was also jarring because the author kept skipping around from past to present to distant past to only yesterday past and into the point of view of 6 or 7 main characters. It was hard to keep straight when everything happened and who it happened to. I liked that were no villains, just desperate people who made me both sympathize with and despise (especially the mother). There was a good twist sorta near the end, but the very ending was a total downer and it felt like a cheap contrived trick.     Was the book interesting and controversial and does it make you question your own definition of right and wrong? Yes! Would I ever read it again or see the movie? No!!!

B003405MF6|5.0|This cd has been slammed by quite a few because of the lack of the faster numbers that he has played in the past. If one truly listens to Jeffs past music going back to Beck Bolero, one would realize that this is a continuation of his previous work. Jazz,blues,classical,funk and rock n roll. Although this cd has less rock n roll to it than his previous cds. I have been listening to Jeff for over 35 years and he never fails to suprise me, he expands where he has been before and charts new territory with each release. Some may long for Rod Stewart to join back up with Jeff, never going to happen and it should not. Jeff does not need Rod nor any vocalist. He has 3 on this cd and only one song out of the entire set falls short and that is with Joss Stone version of  \\"I Put a Spell on You\\", to much keyboard for my taste in the song. It is a rock n roll/ blues song and the keyboard does not do it justice. The rest of the cd is perfect, one can hear the sound of birds(Beck on guitar) on Nessa Dorma if one has a good system and listens. Jeff Beck is one of the best if not the best guitarist that ever lived. If you play guitar try to come close to his sound and you will find how painstakingly difficult it is. For those who do not, and do not find the majesty of his playing on this cd, then you should ask someone who truly knows the guitar and ask them to try to play this. Absolutely one of the best cds of the year and perhaps of the decade.

0394400267|4.0|A fascinating journey back in time to late medieval Europe, with a primary focus on France and England in the 14th century.  This period best is described as a time of fear and conflict. Tuchman uses the life of Enguerrand de Coucy, lord of one of the greatest feudal domains in France, as a backdrop to inform us through most of the book.  Especially insightful and sympathetic were the descriptions of the lives  of peasants, serfs and urban poor and their exploitation by the upper classes, church, and other assorted mercenaries.  Colorful depictions of the depredations, hypocrisy and wretched excesses  of the ruling elite who failed  to  control their base greed, stupidity and anger.  With the  Hundred  Years War always in the  background,  Tuchman weaves intriguing tales of petty rebellions,<br />decline of the medieval church, attempted governmental reforms and political infighting.  Also, a chilling  description of the coming of the  Black Death. Extremely readable and entertaining for a history book!
B00007FOMP|5.0|The utter genius and legendary Marvin Gaye, rightly hailed as the king of Motown, remains one of the most outstanding, influential and innovative artist's in Soul music - infact Popular music in general. His unparalled, undisputed talents set standards for generations. What's Going On is, arguably, his most ever-green work.    'What's Going On' nearly didn't happen. It seems so inconceivable now but Motown boss Berry Gordy didn't understand or appreciate the songs depth upon first hearing, adament that it wouldn't be a commercial success. Gordy initially even refused to release the single, convinced it would flop. In retaliation to this, Gaye refused to record any more material for Motown until Gordy finally (and reluctantly) relented and in January 1971, the single hit record stores. Well, Gaye's gut instinct proved to be spot on - the single flew up to No.2 on the US Pop Billboard Chart. Gaye then proceeded to record the remainder of the album of the same name, which was completed within ten days in March'71 and the release being in May of the same year. The album was quickly recognised and acknowledged as a universal masterpiece, swiftly dispelling any reservation Berry Gordy may have had.    Unlike before he recorded this project, Gaye was allowed the full artistic and creative freedom to write and produce material about issue's of the world he cared deeply about. His work on here came straight from the heart. Gaye meditated and reflected on the American dream of the past, conveying often poetic-like lyrics that related to the escalating urban decy, spiralling environmental problems, police brutality, poverty and unemployment - issue's that had touched Gaye's soul.    The majestic title track is a pure masterpiece and one of the upmost greatest Soul/Pop recordings ever made. A glorious backing arrangement, including a beautifully understated Saxophone interlude on the track's magical opening, intertwine effectively with Gaye's pure emotive and soulful performance. The lyrics are thought-provoking throughout; if you take a listen, the song is sadly just as relevant today as it was back in 1971.    The remainder of this project is sublime. The beautifully soulful, atmospheric mood are entwined with alternately warm, optimistic, angry and at time depressed vocals from this musical visionary. Without a doubt this is Gaye's all-time greatest work, among a long list of top-quality albums that he was to record following this.    'What's Happening Brother' continues in a similar vein to 'What's Going On', the tone and mood sombre and thoughtful. Erratic, divine sax interludes are encapsulated by thick, pulsating basslines and deep, relaxed grooves that becomes contagious. The song depicts the total despair of poverty and unemployment, complemented by Marvin's simply magnificent vocals.    'Flyin High (In The Friendly Sky)', dealing with environmental topics, is set to a smooth, slow beat, filled with bongo's against a gently pounding percussion. The devastatingly poignant 'Save The Children' is deeply profound, reflecting on our rapidly deterioating climate and desperate, abandoned children in the world.    The spiritual 'God Is Love' is an effective forerunner to one of Gaye's definitive classics, the compelling 'Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)' capturing an inspired performance from Gaye while the 8-minute epic of 'Right On', with a winding arrangement, highlighted by repetitive precussion, a sensual piano backdrop, tinkling flutes and conga's, is another outstanding masterpiece that once more explores relevant political issue's.    'Whole Holy' is even more dreamy and mellow flowing seamlessly with a striking blend of instruments. Gaye's relaxed yet strongly emotive vocals enhance the beautifully sparse production. This steadily leads up to the final track and another of Gaye's essential classics, 'Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)' which is utterly captivating. Gaye's unique, distinct voice surfs along the sweeping musicallandscapes and just listen to the delightful sounds of Motown's hero's The Funk Brother's (Motown's in-house muscians) masterful, well-crafted, dynamic playing in what has to be one of their most startling and memroable sessions.    What's Going On' was Marvin Gaye's haunting, heartfelt and beautiful, profound expressions of hope, anger and concern. This has stood the time impeccably well, remaining one of the very best, most stylish, accomplished and thought-provoking Soul albums of all time - if not THE best! Essential to any record collection.    Ian Phillips  April 2010
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this book and found it hard to put down.  Piper writes so well about a world few of us understand.  The stories of the women she served with were so interesting, as were her descriptions of prison routines.  A great read and definitely enlightens a reader about the challenges, frustrations, and opportunities of minimum security prison.  I have a picture of that world now.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|It's a technical masterpiece, overwhelming in its beauty. However, the story line is full of cliches. Essentially, it's Dances With Wolves in Space, with Fern Gully thrown in. I suspect that its beauty will be diminished when seen in DVD/Blue Ray on a TV screen simply because of the size difference, wherein you will miss details.

B00007L4OM|5.0|so glad to check out this movie ... watched it in the original french version ... eng. subs - no problem. plot is great ... amazed at all the japanese actors speak french so fluently. the japanese actress who played the jean reno's daughter .. don't believe the japanese actors' french are dupped ... looks like they're all bi-lingual in french and japanese. how awesome. highly recommended for those who have yet to see this movie. the dvd we bot from amazon is digitally remastered and plays great visual with good sound system. it is rated \\"R\\" for \\"some violence\\" on the dvd cover ... but the violence is nothin' compared to hollywood's. (imho)

B000063JDE|4.0|I'm not exactly a David Lynch fan as such; I think some of his films are too self-consciously \\"difficult\\" for their own good. But 'Blue Velvet' is definitely a personal favourite. Perhaps it's because this is one of Lynch's more straightforward works; its narrative is linear, and no characters change into a different person or become possessed by a demon halfway through the film. Of course, \\"straightforward\\" for David Lynch is still very dark and twisted. 'Blue Velvet' is an unsettling and often surreal film that explores the typical Lynch theme of a dark underworld lurking beneath a seemingly ideal community.    Even if you don't like his films, you must concede that Lynch always gets strong and interesting performances out of his actors. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern are perfect as the wholesome all-American young couple, with MacLachlan's Beaumont equally believable as the naive innocent at the beginning of the film and the more morally ambiguous character he becomes. Isabella Rossellini is surprisingly effective as the battered victim-yet-femme-fatale Dorothy, while Dean Stockwell's memorable cameo as Ben almost steals the show. The real star, of course, is Dennis Hopper, who gives an intensely disturbing performance as the obscene gas-inhaling psychopath Frank Booth. Frank is terrifying because he's completely amoral; he is capable of literally anything and in Lynch's hands you never know what the next \\"anything\\" will be. The surreal tone of the film adds to the unease by giving several scenes (especially involving Frank) a very unreal, other-worldly quality. The term \\"nightmarish\\" is over-used, but the combination of the violent and the bizzare really does make 'Blue Velvet' feel like a nightmare, or perhaps a very twisted S&M fantasy.    As with many Lynch films, 'Blue Velvet' is difficult to categorise. It has elements of mystery, drama, film noir, and even black comedy (there's some surprisingly effective dark humour here, despite the intensity). Althoughnot as difficult as some of his later films such as 'Lost Highway', this is still a very confronting and challenging piece of work, and is certainly not for everybody. But if Lynch's twisted all-American vision sounds like your thing, 'Blue Velvet' is probably the best place to start before tackling some of his even more experimental films.

This album's concert was the best by far. This CD is great from track 1 til 15.  Don't skip one track you will miss something! I will continue to buy A. Keys music as long as she makes it.

B001JV5BIA|3.0|As a film about rape, murder and revenge, 'Last House on the Left' was always one of those movies that guaranteed a certain amount of controversy. Although received well enough in the States (albeit with some opposition), in Britain, Wes Craven's debut was doomed to be kicked around the censors and ended up being banned outright when it was submitted for classification in 1974. It was submitted again, two years later and again it was rejected.    But, in the early 80's \\"anything goes\\" nature of video releases, Craven's film was unleashed upon the home video viewing public on VHS and Betamax. With only a comedy scene cut from its running time, which ironically made for a stronger overall film!     Inevitably, 'Last House on the Left' was destined to become one of those infamous video nasties that made the rounds in Britain in the early 80's and two years after it was released on tape, it was pulled from the shelves in 1984 under the \\"Video Nasties\\" bill. In Britain, the film still courts controversy, while it goes uncensored in most parts of the world.    However, upon viewing, one may wonder why its reputation is so infamous. There are certainly shocking scenes in the running time, but for the most part they remain somewhat muted. Especially when compared to other movies. In addition, the \\"shocks\\" are diluted incredibly by the ineptly handled comedy, which is really out of place here. It boggles the mind why Craven chose to lumber an otherwise tight script (ripped from Ingmar Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring') with such ill-conceived and unfunny \\"humour\\". Really, I cannot stress enough how bad the goofy scenes are. They just do not work on any level whatsoever and mar the project terribly.    The basic script involving Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) and Mari's (Sandra Cassell) abduction and brutal treatment, coupled with the revenge of Phyllis' parents sufficed and would have made for a more powerful and rewarding film, if one likes such films. The cheap film stock and non-stars lend a certain realism to everything, but this is shattered by the insertion of screwball music and silly laughs. There is also no explanation of why Krug (David Hess) and his gang Fred (Fred Lincoln), Junior (Marc Sheffler) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain) are doing what they do, which is good and goes some way to increasing the senselessness of the two teenagers' unfortunate fate. The gang are a despicable bunch and for the most part remain convincing, with particularly menacing performances by Hess and Lincoln.    A real \\"grindhouse\\" film, 'Last House on the Left' has inevitably lost most of its \\"umph\\" over the years. But, it still has that power to make the viewer uncomfortable. It's not the gross-out, shock-fest that you may have heard of, but it does leave the viewer with a slight disturbance after the credits have rolled and in an era where far too many films end with \\"meh\\", that's a good thing I suppose.    Incidentally, viewers who enjoyed this may want to seek out David Hess playing pretty much the same role in Ruggero Deodato's 'The House on the Edge of the Park' and you should keep an eye out for Martin Kove, who plays the Deputy. You may recognise him as Detective Isbecki from 'Cagney and Lacey'.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor and in \\"Tootsie\\" he proves how versatile a performer he can be. When you watch this comedy you forget all about \\"Midnight Cowboy\\", \\"Marathon Man\\", \\"The Graduate\\", and \\"Rain Man\\", all films where Dustin proved he is without a doubt the best actor Hollywood has ever had. In \\"Tootise\\" Dustin shows his comedic chomps and to this day his portrayal as a man who cross dresses as a woman to garner a role on a daytime soap is widely regarged by critics and fans as an intelligent and poignant performance. Dustin plays an out-of-work actor in New York City who cannot find a job as he has become known as \\"difficult\\" to work with. He eventually dons a wig, dress, and highheels, and tries out for a part on the highly rated serial \\"Southwest General\\", obviously named after daytime's then #1 rated soap opera \\"General Hospital\\". He gets the part and what eventaully happens is a series of misunderstandings as everyone believes that the Hoffman character, Dorothy Michaels, is a real person.<br /> Jessica Lange received the first of her two Oscars playing the co-star in \\"Southwest General\\", as well as the love interest to the Hoffman character. Big-time Hollywood director Sydney Pollack directed the film.<br /> \\"Tootsie\\" has found a niche for itself on the list of the best films ever, and upon its release became a huge boxoffice smash. On a budget of $20,000,000 \\"Tootsie\\" has grossed nearly $200,000,000 as of 2010.<br /> This new 25th Anniversary Edition features interviews, trailers, commentary, and more.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|I was fourteen-years-old when I watched Wrestlemania XX, I took the day off school and sat on the edge of my seat virtually the whole way. It was one of the most awesome and memorable times for me as a wrestling fan watching my favourite wrestlers win and retail titles.   Six years later, I thought I'd go back and watch it again. Here's my review:    {WWE United States Championship}  Big Show (c) vs. John Cena    This was John Cena's first Wrestlemania, being with the WWE for nearly two years by this point already. But it was still a good debut for him. He and Big Show had been feuding somewhat recently, both of them being involved in a triple threat with Kurt Angle at No Way Out a month beforehand.  Their match was far from great or memorable, it was almost entirely dominated by Big Show barring a few punches from Cena here and there.  But Cena ended up winning after nailing Big Show with a pair of brass knucks and hitting with the FU, which I have to admit is impressive to see on someone the mass of Big Show.  This is noteworthy I guess as being both Cena's first Wrestlemania and his first title win in the WWE.    6/10 (because it was slow and one-sided, but still good to see Cena win.)    {World Tag Team Championship Match}  {Fatal Four Way}  Rob Van Dam & Booker T (c) vs. La Resistance vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade    Ehh... I'm a huge fan of Rob Van Dam and Booker T as singles wrestlers, but I hate when two guys like these, who should be in the main event, are thrown together and given the tag team titles because the writing team can't find anything else for them to do. The Tag Team Championship should be reserved for legitimate tag teams like the Dudleyz or La Resistance. It's also disappointing to see Booker T here since he was wrestling for the World Heavyweight Championship at the Wrestlemania before this.  Anyway, the match was short and, as can be expected from a match with four tag teams, quite jumbled and hard to follow at times.There were lots of random tags with no team really getting an upperhand anywhere.  Somewhere towards the end, all chaos broke out and everyone started fighting ringside for some reason, Booker T then hit Rob Conway with a Scissors Kick which RVD followed up with a Five Star Frog Splash to win and retain the titles.  There was a lot of talent in this match, however, I can't help but feel that it was only made so that the smaller teams of La Resistance and Jindrak & Cade were able to get onto a Wrestlemania card. Ideally, I think I would've actually preferred to see The Dudley Boyz turn heel and just have a straight forward 2-on-2 match with RVD and Booker T.    6.5/10 (because I'm a mark for RVD and seeing him win a title match - any title match - is awesome)    Christian vs. Chris Jericho    This was the first standout match of the night. Christian and Jericho had a long lasting alliance as heels dating back to 2002. But this match turned Jericho face. It also had a romance storyline behind it, with Chris Jericho falling for Trish Stratus, and Christian becoming jealous. I felt Jericho's face turn off of such a sappy angle was kind of weak, but still, it worked for me.  Jericho and Christian put on an excellent match, a lot of high spots and back and forths and it had an ending that I don't think anyone really predicted.  Trish Stratus ran out to the ring towards the end of the match, Christian dragged her into the ring involving her in the match. Trish then inadvertently smacked Jericho with an elbow by mistake letting Christian roll him up and get the surprise win.  After the match, it looked as though Trish was about to apologize to Chris Jericho, instead, she gave him two the hardest slaps ever, followed by an Unprettier from Christian. Christian then made out with Trish on the stage, effectively turning Trish Stratus into a heel for the first time in years, and Chris Jericho into a full fledged fan favourite.    8.5/10    {Handicap Match}  Randy Orton, Batista& Ric Flair vs. The Rock 'n' Sock Connection    It was great to see The Rock 'n' Sock Connection reunite, regardless of if they won or lost. And the fact that The Rock and Mick Foley were involved with Wrestlemania 20 added to the scope and excitement of the show overall.  The match itself was pretty good, some parts of it did drag a bit, with Evolution getting the upperhand for most of it. But hey, we got to see a People's Elbow and a Rock Bottom, and a mandible claw.  But Randy Orton managed to get the pinfall on Mick Foley with a surprise RKO just as Foley pulled out Mr. Socko.  This is the last match that The Rock has been in, so it would have been nicer to see him in a legitimate match. Maybe one day we'll see The Rock vs. Randy Orton one-on-one? But either way, it was just good to see this match, and as much as it sucked to see Evolution get the win, it did give Orton the heat he needed to get the main event push and the world title later in the year.    7/10    {Interpromotional Playboy Evening Gown Match}  Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie vs. Torrie Wilson & Sable    This was time filler and eye candy. You know you're not going to really get a wrestling match when it has divas in it and \\"playboy\\" is in the title of the match stipulation.   The match was extremely short - which worked in its favour. But it wasn't much of a match. All the girls decided they'd rather wrestle with their evening gowns off and stripped down, although Miss Jackie had to be forceably coerced into taking her dress off.  Torrie and Sable ended up getting the win and what was quite a forgettable match.    4/10 (they only get a 4 because they're hot.)    {WWE Cruiserweight Championship}  {Cruiserweight Open}  Chavo Guerrero (c) vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Shannon Moore vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Nunzio vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri vs. Akio    This was a sort of gauntlet kind of match. Basically two guys started in the ring, every time one wrestler was pinned or tapped out, he would leave and another cruiserweight would enter at random. Last man standing is the new champion.  I won't go through the details, but I will mention a highlight being Billy Kidman's springboard shooting star press out of the ring onto two other enemies.  The match came down to Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero whom had been feuding. But Chavo, with help from his dad, Chavo Guerrero Snr, cheated and won.  Much like the tag match, I saw this as a way to get ten wrestlers who normally wouldn't be on Wrestlemania, into the spotlight for a few minutes. Still, the match had some good moments and made it entertaining enough.    7/10    Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg  {Special Guest Referee: Steve Austin}    This match was nothing but hype. Lesnar and Goldberg had been having an interpromotional feud for a few months where they kept invading each other's shows, culminating Goldberg costing Lesnar the WWE title at No Way Out.  I guess in someways, this match made sense. I mean, Goldberg, the guy that was unstoppable in WCW with that massive undefeated streak of his, and Brock Lesnar - the WWE's own home made version of Goldberg, having a match at Wrestlemania. But it just didn't work.  The match seemed to drag forever, and it was obvious that the audience were against both of them and the match in general. By now it was public knowledge that Goldberg's contract was at an end and Brock Lesnar was leaving pro wrestling.  Goldberg hit a spear and a jackhammer to win, no surprise there.   After the match, Austin gave both Lesnar and Goldberg a stunner each, which was the only time the crowd seemed to pop at all.  This was the worst match of the night. And I sat through the evening gown match. It was horrible and made me want to hit the skip button as soon as possible. No one really wanted either Lesnar or Goldberg to win, no one cared when Goldberg did win. People were just happy that the match was over.    2/10 (the only reason it gets higher than 1 is because Austin saved it at theend).    {WWE Tag Team Championship}  {Fatal Four Way}  Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty (c) vs. The Basham Brothers vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team vs. The APA    My sentiments on this match echo my feelings on the Raw Tag Team match. This was an excuse to fill time and give some smaller names a shot on a Wrestlemania card and had very little build up.  I think the best team in this match was The World's Greatest Tag Team, but Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty, the fan favourites, left with the win.   It is interesting though, to see Bradshaw here in the APA wrestling on an undercard match, losing to Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty. A few months after this, he'd be main eventing pay-per-views as John Bradshaw Layfield, holding the WWE Championship.    5/10 (too short and the mediocrity of the Lesnar/Goldberg match rubbed off onto this one.)    {WWE Women's Championship}  {Hair vs. Title Match}  Victoria (c) vs. Molly Holly    I'm glad they made this match, Victoria and Molly, along with Trish, were probably the best in-ring divas at the time of Wrestlemania XX. Wrestling wise, this match heavily overshadowed the other diva match of the night. However, I think it still could have been better. If they gave them maybe a few extra minutes, they could have done a lot more and made the match even better. But as it stands, the match wasn't amazing and could have just as easily taken place on Raw.  Victoria ended up rolling up Molly to get the win. Then she dragged her to the barber's chair, strapped her in and proceeded to cut her hair, which admittedly was funny to watch.    5.5/10 (it needed a little bit more time and it could have been miles better.)    {WWE Championship}  Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Kurt Angle    Finally, where Christian and Chris Jericho left off, Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero pick up here, by which I mean, the good wrestling part of the show.  Eddie and Kurt put on a stellar match with Eddie being the underdog. This match would also prove whether or not Eddie would be a mainstay in the SmackDown main event scene or if he'd just be a transitional champion. It would also test how much faith the WWE had in him, giving him a main event match at Wrestlemania.  Turns out they had a lot of faith. They gave him and Kurt Angle 20+ minutes which was full of amazing wrestling moments, which ended with Eddie slipping his boot off in the middle of an Ankle Lock, then rolling up Kurt Angle into a small package and using the ropes for the win.  This was definitely in strong competition for match of the night, and it also washed that bad Lesnar/ Goldberg taste out of my mouth.    9/10 (couldn't ask for much better than that.)    Kane vs. The Undertaker    I think that the buildup for this match was excellent. The writers actually put a lot of time, effort and creativity into it. As popular as The Undertaker always has been, I don't think he has ever gotten over with the fans as well as he should have when he was going through with his biker gimmick. It's his Deadman gimmick that people will always remember him for, not riding to the ring on a motorbike, wearing sunglasses and referring to the ring as his \\"yard.\\"  I have to admit, I had my eyes glued to the screen for The Undertaker's entrance when I watched this for the first time. It felt very surreal and exciting seeing all of The Undertaker's hooded minions holding flaming torches as well as Paul Bearer himself leading the way for The Undertaker's return.  The match itself - it wasn't great. Although I wasn't necessarily expecting great. The role of this match was mostly just to bring The Undertaker back from the dead and renew the fan's interest in him.  We saw vintage Undertaker, all the moves that he's famous for barring the Last Ride.   He ended up hitting with a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver to get the win.    6/10 (I'm rating the match itself here. If I were to rate the buildup and the excitement of seeing The Undertaker's return, then the rating would be a lot higher.)    {World Heavyweight Championship}  Triple H (c) vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit    This was as good of a main event that you could ask for, and probably the best triple threat match I can ever remember seeing. When I first watched it, I legitimately had no idea which way it would go. I was so torn. I wanted desperately for Chris Benoit to finally get the win, but at the same time, I was a huge HBK fan and I loved his feud with Triple H regardless of how long it was dragging on for. But at the same time, I had seen Triple H go main event after main event without putting anyone over, so I probably wouldn't have been shocked if he left still the champion.  But I managed to have a sigh of relief as Triple H tapped out to the Crossface at just over 25 minutes into the match. It was a stellar match. Pretty much everyone was busted open and bloodied. We saw all the trademark moves, Sweet Chin Music, Pedigree, Crossface, Flying Headbutt. We saw Chris Benoit get suplexed through an announcers table. We even saw Triple H and Shawn Michaels teaming up briefly, but only so that HBK could get what he wanted - Triple H one on one.   But Benoit managed to get back into the ring, reverse a super kick and hurl Michaels out of the ring before countering the pedigree into the crossface on Triple H for the win.  After the match, Eddie entered the ring and celebrated with Chris Benoit in what was a great and memorable moment, seeing two fan favourites and best friends together at Wrestlemania with the two heavyweight championships.    10/10    ---    Overall:    Wrestlemania XX definitely has a lot of highs and a lot of lows. It has a lot in the way of time fillers, what with the evening gown match, the tag matches and the cruiserweight open, however, entertainment can still be found in these time fillers. No matter how irrelevant a match with so many wrestlers as the Cruiserweight open might be, you can still find entertainment in the highflying and impressive stunts pulled off by the likes of Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio. You can still enjoy seeing Rob Van Dam and Booker T coming out of Wrestlemania as champions, and you can still enjoy the evening gown match for the obvious reason that it has four hot women leaving very little to the imagination.  It's lowest point, if you haven't already guess, is the Goldberg and Lesnar match, but even then you can find some entertainment in the audience's reaction, how heavily they're against the match. And you can find entertainment in Stone Cold Steve Austin. If he can't entertain you as a wrestling fan, then I don't know who can.  And it's high points are great. Chris Jericho and Christian put on a memorable and excellent match for the undercard, while both the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship matches are in a class of their own.  And of course, it's a great sight to see The Undertaker returning as the Dead Man.  I will note that I found it strangely uncomfortable to watch in some ways, especially the Chris Benoit segments. It's an understatement to say that it's difficult to root for someone who did what he did. Double murder-suicide aside, that won't ever take away the fact that he was one of the industries most hard working and intense workers and he, along with Triple H and Shawn Michaels, put on an amazing main event well worth your money.    I would definitely recommend Wrestlemania - it has loads of DVD extras as well, the usuals that you can come to expect from a WWE DVD (pre and post match interviews etc.) as well as a ton of other features.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I was born and raised in the movie business, and I've met many actors, writers, producers and directors, and I've come to believe that any good film has to tell a very good story whether it's fiction or a \\"true story\\", none of this Avatar junk.  In addition, a movie has to have been edited as a work of love and not something to shoved down the throats of moviegoers, at $8-$20 a pop.    Das Boot is one of the greatest films ever produced.  Based on Lothar-Gunther Buchheim's novel, the film tells the story of a German U-boat crew in early 1941, at a point in the war in the Atlantic where the British are turning the tide against the Kriegsmarine.  The captain of the boat is bemoaning the fact that many of the \\"Old Gang\\" have been killed in a war he despises, and the captain also bemoans the fact that his crew is mostly made up of kids who should be home with their mothers.  He says he feels as though he's on a Childrens Crusade.    As the story unfolds, we are now members of the crew because we are inside the boat in the upper and lower decks, and we get a real sense of what it is like to be crowded (50 men)in a submarine that always reeks of diesel fuel, sweaty bodies, and damp clothing.  The recreation of the submarine made you feel that you were really on the boat    At one point, the boat is forced to dive, because of an enemy destroyer attack, where depth charges are dropped in the hope that one or more of them will cause the boat to implode and sink.  You see the very real fear on the faces of the crew, and as this incident is repeated thoughout the film, we see that the crew is essentially falling apart, and hope for survival wanes.    The captain and his chief officers hold things together, but it is the captain and his chief engineer who are the heroes of this boat, U-96. After many harrowing incidents, the boat, which was nearly sunk, returns to its home base, LaRochelle, France, only to be finally sunk by a British air attack.    As a former US Army soldier,I could easily identify with the fear and misery that the crew experienced.     The director, Wolfgang Peterson, made a movie so real, and so personal, that anyone who has ever been in combat, whether it is on land, sea, or in the air, can identify with.  For those who are not combat veterans, the movie is just plain great entertainment, and it is a tribute to hard work, detail, and all other human emotions that are used to produce a truly great film.
0198534469|5.0|This book lives true to its name. Most other complex analysis books put so much focus on the algebra of complex analysis that the geometry of complex numbers are almost forgotten. However, this book puts geometry first and foremost. In fact there is very little algebraic proofs at all throughout the book. Rather than going through complex and detailed algebraic proofs he mostly relies on the readers geometric intuition to guide the reader to the proper conclusions.    My favorite aspect of the book is with the authors writing style. I had to read this book for a graduate level math class and I was expecting a dry hard read. However, to my shock this read more like a philosophical discourse. Don't let this fool you, though. It is still very heavy stuff. The approach is just different (and fun).
B001ED7C58|5.0|Extremely Satisfied.  Order process was quick and easy and I received everything sooner than anticipated.
0374530718|4.0|The book is pretty much a modern day version of Plato's Dialogues -- the author uses the Socratic method to drive discussions between the characters in the book.    This does a pretty good job at explaining the relationships between most of the major philosophical viewpoints but it doesn't really explain anything in any significant detail.     Overall it was a good book. It has more to offer those without a lot of philosophical knowledge, though.
0805076476|5.0|This is an excellent book. Chuck Palahniuk has a very unique style. Definitely a must read that includes though-provoking rants, dark humor, and ultimately a very strange love story.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|The DVD is spectacular. After 27 years Madonna is still as electric and intense as ever. I saw the live concert in New York in 2008. Nothing compares to the live show. She has inspired so many people, including myself. The energy and technical expertise of the show is jaw dropping. The best number is \\"Get into the Groove\\". A must for any fan or for someone who wants to get a taste of a true artist.
B002VECM72|5.0|The Blind Side DVD is an excellent film.  I could have bought it several places, but chose Amazon for price and usual delivery outcome.  Occasionally I experience some delivery problems with Amazon purchases, but delivery of this DVD was quite timely and it arrived in excellent condition.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|It's already been said by other reviewers, but these little snap-on accessories make an already great controller pretty much perfect.  I'm by no means a hardcore gamer.  I noticed these when browsing Amazon one day and made a note to try them when I needed another $5 purchase to get free super-saver shipping.  They are absolutely simple to snap into place, and once they're there, it'll feel like they should have always been there.  Will they make you a world champ in your favorite game?  Probably not if you aren't already.  But they will make the controller more comfortable to use and help you be more precise.  Great care was taken to match the material texture and appearance with the original buttons, so they don't even really stand out as an add-on once attached to your controller.
0446530573|5.0|I like this book because not only are there reciepes, but also alot of other things said by the cast about the differnt menu topics. Great Buy! and it was very inexpensive for what you get from the book.
B00284BMBM|4.0|I have been listening to \\"lifehouse\\" aka \\"Daughtry\\" they have a lot of good songs and I believe they were a christain band back in the day..His song \\"BROKEN\\" is ( to me) the best..He has a very unique voice and I'd know it anywhere. Not to mention he's VERY good looking! :)

1416594787|1.0|Famed anti-theist and biologist Richard Dawkins has written a new book entitled The Greatest Show on Earth. No, it's not a history of the Ringling Brothers-it's his apologetic in defense of evolution. In the first chapter, Dawkins spends considerable time lamenting the large percentage of humanity that still believes in something as fanciful as Creationism. He goes on to declare that evolution is an undeniable fact-something as real and self-evident as the earth itself. That is, except for the fact that you can't see it. And this leads him to compare evolutionary scientists to forensic investigators piecing together the evidence of a crime scene after the fact.    But in his analogy, Dawkins misses the point. He's right, of course-scientists are similar to forensic investigators in the sense that they want to answer how something occurred. But there is one major difference: to the forensic investigator, answering How is only a means to an end. It is not an end in itself. It is subordinate to the larger and more significant questions of Who and Why. Those are the ultimate questions, and the questions to which everyone craves answers.    Without answers to the questions of Who and Why, a case remains ultimately unsolved. There may be a full and detailed understanding of the cause of death, yet without these answers, the victim's family is left in the agony of unknowing. They want a reason. They want a perpetrator.    But in Dawkins' universe, there is no Who or Why. Who made this? No one. Why are we here? No reason. It could be said that Dawkins is being unreasonable. He has gone to great lengths to remove these most human of questions from the arena of thought simply because he does not like where they lead.    Yet, these are the questions everyone is really asking, and they are quite reasonable. Dawkins' case remains, and will remain, unsolved because he hasn't yet answered them. Creationism remains and will remain because it has.    In short, Dawkins' atheism is too simple. It is not satisfying. It is no more satisfying than knowing, to continue the analogy, that your child was violently murdered by no one. Deep in the human consciousness, we know there's more to the story. There's the Story, and it starts in the beginning.    I predict failure for Mr. Dawkins' crusade to turn the world zealously after a question it isn't asking. No, the world is far too wonderful and man too mystical for atheism to flourish. Yet, I suspect Mr. Dawkins will not realize his mistake. He will continue to puzzle over those who will not accept his answer to the question they didnt' ask. He will go on asking a question which, by his own reasoning, is ultimately irrelevant. So Mr. Dawkins, keep asking How as long as you wish. I will simply ask you in turn a question that has much deeper and profounder implications-a question which strikes at the very heart of human nature: Why do you ask?
B001QITO52|2.0|I'd have a lot more respect (though no more love) for this album if it was released as a David Gilmour solo album (which it is in all but name) but having recently listened to this album again, it's aged even worse than I remember.  It is on par with Gilmour's second solo album which is to say it has brief moments of beauty but is mostly forgettable.  This album is as much a pop album as About Face was but at least that didn't masquerade as a  Pink Floyd album.  I find all of Floyd's albums from Meddle onward to still be relevant today but this is dispensable.  Check out On An Island if you want to hear Gilmour's talents (or Division Bell which is far better than this).
B0038VPB5W|2.0|Get right to the point with this review. The songs you will want to listen to on this are Your Betrayal, Pleasure And Pain, Dignity,Begging For Mercy and Pretty On The Inside. With Your betrayal and Begging For Mercy being the best of those 5. Skip the rest of the cd and save your time and energy. I still say the best song these guys ever wrote Is Tears Dont Fall.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|reading the negative reviews on this disc which focus on the lack of special features is missing the point. Yes agree special features are nice to have, but i would rather have a quality feature movie master. For $20 you are buying one of the most technologically advanced BD ever in terms of the complexity of the visual and audio imformation, spun into a movie which is very enjoyable. If you own a decent home theatre this disc will be one of the greatest bargains you will purchase. This disc is THE disc i now would play to test a setup if i had to choose one disc. The film is good and the producers of this BD have done the most important thing IMO, master the production at highest possible quality. For $20 for a BD and a DVD its a bargain.    As a sidenote BD still holds the quality standard for home theatre, while providing full ownership of content, not something that you can fully say of some of the virtual formats.
B001TODCII|5.0|Taken had a lot of action in it from start to end. This movie was well thought out<br />and keeps you intense, from beginning to end, because the action was always there.<br />When the suspense started, you tell yourself, get those bad guys. They deserved all<br />of the punishment they all got in this movie. It keeps you interested all the way<br />through, so buy it, you'll like too.
B0038VPB5W|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Bullet since The Poison was released and after listening to Fever I was really disappointed.  If you were not a previous fan of Bullet then you might find this album to be good.  The power and force that Bullet once had is gone.  I thought that Scream Aim Fire was a step down from The Poison but it was still a great album.  Fever on the other hand has very little screaming which I think was a great part of their previous sound and the heaviness that they usually have is barely there at all.  Coming from a huge fan that has seen them live many times if you are expecting traditional Bullet you might get let down.
B002VECMAE|5.0|The Men Who Stare At Goats was a pretty funny movie. Even though there was some seriousness in this movie,<br />it still had a lot funny scenes in it as well. Being based on a true story, made it even more funny, when it<br />was funny, because you wouldn't expect someone to do the dumb things that they do in the movie. I enjoyed the<br />movie and I know you will too. So give it a try and buy it.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|If you thought this was amazing on screen and on DVD, wait until you see it on Blu-ray
B002HFWAXG|3.0|This is a great and entertaining movie, however when sellers of this blu ray version are emailed and asked questions they simply do not respond; the questions asked were simple, such as, where was it made, what languages does it offer, does it go to 1080P or 1080I, can it do German. However no response to any emails, I would suggest buyer beware, when the seller tends to ignore any questions about thier product. I am geussing that the product is an import, so ask questions before you buy about everything, like resolution, languages, pressing origination, and quality of picture.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|I was going to write that Avatar could be put on the blog Stuff White People Like under the heading \\"romance with exotic natives,\\" but really isn't there so much more to Avatar... like a big battle!  So, instead, I'll just point out that while others have noticed that Avatar seems like a remake of other movies like Dances with Wolves and Aliens, you can see elements from other movies/scifi here, too, like Dune and Robotech.  But I really see Avatar channelling Jurassic Park.  Unlike the Star Wars prequels, in which the special effects were overhyped, Jurassic Park took moviegoers by storm because the movie was so unexpectedly successful at creating realistic primeval beasts to hunt people in the jungle.  Avatar pretty much has the same feel.<br /><br />So, you're James Cameron.  Maybe you're watching Rebecca Romijn in X-Men and thinking how you'd like to meet her in Second Life.  Then you come up with the idea for yet another Sigourney Weaver Alien film, but this time with sexy blue aliens instead of ones with exoskeletons: Avatar.<br /><br />How do you make Avatar?  Hmmm... think, James, think.  How about re-staging the Battle of Endor from Return of the Jedi and create a Dances with Wolves backstory to explain why the rebels are allied with the Ewoks?  No, seriously.  You just make the Ewoks giant blue humanoids like the Zentradi from Robotech and make the stormtroopers look like the marines from Aliens. (But hey that works out really well, because Giovanni Ribisi looks sort of like Paul Reiser and acts like him, and Sigourney Weaver's already in the movie--what a coincidence!)  Then you set the battle in Jurassic Park instead of on Endor.  Wait, isn't there a space battle in RoJ in addition to the Ewok battle?  No problem, there's pterodactyls in Jurassic Park, so the Zentradis can fly them just like the kids in Dinotopia, and the marines can have a big triangle mother ship like a Star Destroyer that's going to blow up the home base if it's not stopped in time, just like the Death Star in the original Star Wars.<br /><br />And of course it's important to make the battle manipulate the audience the same way, so the good guys have to start winning in the beginning, then you have to change the music and make the bad guys start winning and show the up close deaths of a few beloved minor Ewoks, errr, Zentradis, errr whatevers.  Then the hero has to have a show-down with his arch-nemesis, just like Luke and Darth Vader.  But they can't have light-sabers, so you have to give them giant knives.  Okay, I think that about covers it.  Oh, wait, the Zentradis are really big in addition to being blue, so how will that work?  Well, in Robotech, the people made giant robot suits so they would be the same size, so we can do that, too.  Plus, if we steal the cargo loader from Aliens for the robot suit, it will be just like when Sigourney Weaver fought the alien at the end of Aliens, and Sigourney Weaver's already in the movie--what a cool coincidence!<br /><br />Okay, we can make lots of money with that, but how do we set it up?  Hmmm.  Let's just rip off Aliens again with the whole deep-space cryogenic sleep/mining colony thing.  That'll work great.  And the main character can meet the Jurassic Park Zentradi, fall for Robecca Romijn, and eventually become \\"one of the tribe,\\" just like Dances with Wolves.  The only thing is, how to turn our human into an alien?  Let's look through our shelf of scifi DVD's... hmmmm... oh, yes, The Matrix.<br /><br />Whatever happened to psychological films like Forbidden Planet?th Star in the original Star Wars.    And of course it's important to make the battle manipulate the audience the same way, so the good guys have to start winning in the beginning, then you have to change the music and make the bad guys start winning and show the up close deaths of a few beloved minor Ewoks, errr, Zentradis, errr whatevers.

030745455X|5.0|If you loved \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" you won't be disappointed with this next book in the series. The focus is on Lisbeth Salander, but our friends at Millenium magazine go along for the ride. I had to force myself not to skip to the end to find out Lisbeth's fate numerous times and the tension grew. Excellent cliff hanger ending. I'm very anxious to have the loose ends tied up in the final book \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" Glad it's release is only a month away.
B0000696I1|5.0|unlike others I love sequels and movies based on games or cartoons sequels are the best big time and this movie rocks the best of all three
B00005OCMR|4.0|As bad as the acting and the special effects are, the concept of the story is actually interesting. This movie is a classic as it shows what used to be awesome special effects back in 1982, and it shows how far we've come in the past 30 years. Still fun to watch, a classic, and it now makes me want to go see the Tron: The Legacy in December 2010.
B000IMMR1U|5.0|I was born in the late 70's and grew up with Prince music. I recently purchaced a record player( a year ago) and have been building my collection again. Records I had as a kid were lost or ruined over the years. I was so happy to find this record. It sounds like it did years ago. I play it all the time. Thanks again. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good 80's music.
B0037W68F4|5.0|All of the people who have given this record a poor review have compared it to Mgmt's first album, which was a wonderful, catchy, hit-filled masterpiece.  What they need to do is forget that album was even the same band as this, even better, record.  Congratulations is an absolute thrill to listen to.  It's one of those timeless albums that will still be great in twenty, even thirty, years.  All I can say is Wow.  Congratulations Mgmt, you have achieved something great, and even greater.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|This greatest hits is realy a good work, it rappresent the best of FF production and it's complete by a dvd with the best of video clip of the band. Altought for me (i'm Italian) the price is really convenient.
B000SJHNB2|3.0|I just got this little box in order to do a sesson with some of my buds. It seeps to work and sound ok (not extreme amplification) but the power supply plug fits very loosly (hence the low rating) so I had to use a rubber band to hold it in. Seems most Berringer equipment these days is getting lower and lower in quality.  This may be my last Berringer purchase. Better off with Roll for this kind of equpment.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I was so happy when I found out the Scorpions were releasing a new album. The last song \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" is amazing!!!! It is one of those cherished songs that is excellent from the very first listen. The rest of the album I needed to listen to a few times before the songs really captured me but trust me the second or third time around they did! I have enjoyed the Scorpions from their very first album and after all these years it never ceases to amaze me that they are still performing with the same level of energy and heart felt passion that truly makes them ROCK!!!! Could we be so lucky that the best has yet to come and this will not be their last album?! One can only hope....
0393072231|3.0|Hard to put down - Lewis is a first rate story teller.  And it's a story about some guys who shorted the housing market using the creme-de-la-creme of Wall Street bond brokers. It's as Thomas Sowell might say, \\"a story of heroes and villains, told against the backdrop of a melodrama, with an emotionally satisfying answer,\\" or put another way, the story 80-90% of people want to hear.      Lewis knows his job as he paints his short sellers into everyday everymen who by some peculiarity of personality or quirk of ingenius insight devine what almost all of the leaders in not only Wall Street, but in government and industry fail to see. That social engineering will cause the major part of this financial debacle.     To the uninitiated Lewis might appear to tell the story of the financial crisis, but it falls far short of that.  It's instead exactly what he entitles it, the story of a few who engage in a big short sale designed to profit on a collapsing housing market. It would have been better if Lewis had explained what lay behind this impending collapse, but he sees his narrative as one more to confirm his bias against profit-seeking, greedy, Wall Street money baron's than to tell a complete story. I wish he'd write another book on government housing policy over the last 90 years, but I doubt it will be forthcoming.     His narrative does a good job of acquainting the reader with the relative unknowns who make up his cast of characters.  As the housing market and the volume of acompanying mortgage securities increases, at an unsustainable rate, the brightest of the bright get swept along in the tide. In the end, the biggest firms and their leaders and followers lose everything in a market reversal for the ages.  Merrill Lynch, Lehman Bros, Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Citi Group, AIG, Goldman Sachs, Deutschbank, Morgan Stanley, and others are all just clobbered with losses.  Some are bailed or bought out in deals arranged by the Fed's while others are left to sink beneath the waves, victims of owning the very packages of mortgages they've sold to their customers.  As one wag averred, \\"they ate their own dog food.\\"  Lewis tells the thrust of this story in a highly entertaining and informative manner.  However, there never would have been a bust approaching this magnitude if the mortgage and thrift industries had not been bullied into reduced lending standards corresponding to HUD affordable Housing goals, a process which got revved-up in 1993 by the incoming Clinton administration.      Thru Fed pressures to raise home ownership over 70% from 64% in 1992, lenders were virtually forced to lend money to unqualified buyers with insufficient income and inadequate assets, and with no credit history of repaying anything on a sustained basis.  After housing prices more than doubled from 1997 to 2005, particularly in the four sand-states (Ca, Fl, Nev, Az) where stringent state and federal building restrictions led to inflated land and building expenses, the market began to waffle and fall as loan defaults began to rise. And therin lies the beginnings of the story behind \\"the Big Short.\\"     One could cite the vapidity of the rating agencies (creatures of federal sanction,) the greed and arrogance of the brokers (real and palpable,) the lack of deep due diligence by the buyers of these mortgage pools (too much reliance on faulty triple-A ratings,) and the impossible leverage granted these brokers by the Bob Rubin-led Fed's, and it would all be truer than true, but without the social engineering piece it would have been just another cyclical bust following a cyclical boom in the financial history of our country.  Those like Michael Lewis don't seem to fully grasp that within the concept of individual liberty upon which America is concieved, is the freedom to be stupid followed by the freedom to try again and again.  Thru persistance and determination we've built a great nation, but a continuing governmental thrust toward socialism will harm us all, and the poor the most. Freedom to make mistakes, freedom to screw-up, will lead to success. Yes, I know, it's counter intuitive; but we'll never be able to effectively legislate against the seven deadly sins, and making mistakes isn't a sin.  Beyond that I couldn't put the book down.  A great and informative read!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Got my Blu-Ray in the mail last night. Having just seen the movie in 3D at the theater about 2 weeks ago, I figured I was in for a letdown. NOT! This is a very impressive blu-ray. By far the best picure quality yet on a blu-ray that I have seen.<br /><br />As far as the reviewing the movie, I like that some of Sci-Fi's best ideas can be merged into one movie, and the resulting movie being so good. I will admit that I leaked a few tears when The Sigourney Weaver Avatar died. And I was not the only person doing so.<br /><br />James Cameron makes movies that feature complete character development, easily understood story lines, and superior visual effects that show remarkable attention to detail. It is a shame that I can only give it a ***** rating.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This movie has gorgeous special effects and looks great on Blu-ray, but I'm very disappointed that this version has absolutely no special features...no director's commentary, no behind the scenes footage, no interviews. I wish we had read the reviews before buying. I would have waited for the next version.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Ok. I get it. Part of the reason for so diverse a collection of songs from a somewhat homogenous group of poems is Merchant's desire to show her virtuosity in a variety of styles. I can imagine no other reason for including, for instance, The King of China's Daughter, except to allow Merchant to show her skill in rendering a Chinese song. Nor can I figure out why the Dancing Bear is done up klezmer (since the poem is actually about a gypsy camp), except that Merchant wanted to do klezmer. And the Whomping Window Blind gives her a shot at a hornpipe. And Reggae, for a Topsyturvey World? Really? And a zydeco version of Ogden Nash? The Janitor's Red-haired Boy as a torch song? Of course.<br />The thing that most threatened the project for me was when I heard she was setting Gerard Manley Hopkins' Fall and Spring to music. That could have brought the house crashing down. And didn't. Part of the reason is that Merchant surrounds Hopkins somber verse with sad and reflective songs that defuses Hopkins' lyric explaining to a young girl that she is a sinner and is going to die, making it feel less heinous.<br />This is not to say that the whole album is a monument to Merchant's ingenuity. There are a number of songs that are straightforward in the beauty of the song writing. I really can't imagine Equestrienne set to music any other way. And the first time I heard It Makes a Change, I could not resist a giggle (I assure you, I am a stern old gent not given to giggling). The Nursery Rhyme of Innocence and Experience is exquisitely understated, as is If No One Marries Me.<br /> All in all, it is a very fun ride. It is a very ambitious project carried off with skill and aplomb. They say that the true artist makes the impossible look effortless. Merchant, then, is an artist.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|First thing first, the music. Considering the artistic progression of the band, this release is a logical follow up to Vapor Trails. It's very heavy, complex, intensely layered, and lyrically valid and potent. It's slightly musically odd, as can be expected (and applauded) by many fans, but still retains many tasty hooks also indicative of the band's history. The music is five stars, easily, especially compared to the other crap floating around the music \\"business\\" but more impressively compared to the Rush back catalogue. Snakes and Arrows is absolutely one of my favorite records, and I think you'll enjoy it too. BUT, the production (contrary to what other reviewers thought) is BAD. You now why? because this record was produced by an alt rock producer, as if it was an alt rock album. If you ever listen to it with a pair of premium headphones ($250-$350) you know what I mean. My listening equipment allows me to hear very fine details of the recording that most of you simply will not notice. The soundastage (spatiality and instrument location) is absurdly miniscule. The whole album is highly compressed and tightly packed, the music just lacks that airy quality that prog rock needs. As a result, it can be a pain trying to listen through the heavy layering of some of these songs, some sounds are lost almost entirely in the recording. The frequencies trip all over each other, and interfere with the detail and transparency of the album, again thanks to the alt rock producer. Rush is a complex and highly orchestrated group, and this style of production is just a shame to them; it does no justice to the music and attempts to make them something they're not (a simplistic one note modern alt rock band.) Sadly Rush is using the same producer for their upcoming material, heres to hoping his meager skills have improved.

0812973992|2.0|Colum McCann's Let the Great World Spin may just be the best book I've read that I didn't like. Winner of the National Book Award for fiction last year, McCann's novel reads more like a collection of short stories about various residents of New York City whose lives are connected by a single event in 1974 - the day a tight-rope walker decided to walk between the World Trade Center towers.<br /><br />First, what I did like. McCann's writing is beautiful - poetic at times. Two examples:<br /><br />  \\"Family is like water - it has a memory of what it once filled, always trying to get back to the original stream.\\" (pg. 57)<br /><br />  \\"I gave them all of the truth and none of the honesty.\\" (pg. 303)<br /><br />And the writing is dense - it has weight. But what was lacking for me was an emotional connection to the characters - at least most of them. Keeping to the things I liked, I loved the character of Claire. Claire lives in a Park Avenue apartment (she refuses to call it a penthouse) and is married to an esteemed and Jewish judge. They lost their only son in Vietnam, and in a desperate attempt to connect with women who have experienced her level of loss, answers an ad in the paper. She invites her new club - which includes a black woman who happens to be the one Claire is drawn to the most - to her home and frets over ensuring that each one is made welcome and treated well.<br /><br />The energy that comes from her story is powerful. Her desperation to mourn her son and have him known, her anxious need to be accepted by these women, it is poignant and bittersweet. The tight-rope walker intersects Claire's story on the morning of the gathering at her house. One of the ladies saw the walk on her way in, and the mothers chide the idea that a son would be so reckless with his life. An insightful story and interesting connection to the common thread.<br /><br />If only the other stories had been the same for me. Another primary character is Corrigan, an Irish celibate living in poverty in keeping with a religious order. He keeps a minimal apartment with no locks so that the local prostitutes can use it to have a clean place to use the bathroom and freshen up. As his intentions are misunderstood by the girls' johns, he is frequently beaten up.<br /><br />From Corrigan's story, we meet Tillie and Jazzlyn - mother/daughter prostitutes - Corrigan's brother, the girl Corrigan falls in love with and a couple of hippie artists enjoying a drug binge. But I just didn't care about these folks - for whatever reason, the emotion wasn't there.<br /><br />I think the idea for McCann's book is really good, and some would obviously say well executed. But for me, it didn't hit the mark. I read this one for my book club at work, and had it not been for that, this may have been one I decided to put down.ving in poverty in keeping with a religious order.

It's a shame that when British royalty and relationships are focused on in the press, it's about the disintegration of the relationship, the affairs and the amorality of its participants and anything that the gossip magazines salivate over.<br /><br />Granted, perhaps this interest in the broken relationships of royalty will continue Ad Infinitum but once in awhile, it's good to see a storyline that features true love within royalty and what best than to focus on Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the film \\"The Young Victoria\\" directed by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e (\\"Strangers\\", \\"Loser Love\\", \\"The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne\\") and a screenplay by actor Julian Fellowes (\\"Monarc of the Glen\\", \\"Aristocrats\\", \\"Jane Eyre\\").  Cinematography is by Hagen Bogdanski (\\"Tatort, \\"Der Templer\\", \\"Nachtmusik\\") and music by Ilan Eshkeri (\\"Kick-Ass\\", \\"Centurion\\", \\"Ninja Assassin\\").  The film was also produced by Sarah Ferguson (Her Grace Sarah, Duchess of York) and legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />\\"The Young Victoria\\" is a film that showcases the utmost beauty of that time in history.  Elaborate set designs and costumes and needless to say, the film was recognized by being nominated for three Academy Awards and would win an Oscar for Sandy Powell for \\"Best Achievement in Costume Design\\".  The film would also win a BAFTA Film Award, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award and a few more awards for \\"Best Costume Design\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Young Victoria\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and the film is just gorgeous to look at.  For one, the costume design by Sandy Powell is simply amazing as with the set design in capturing that part of history.  On Blu-ray, the details are simply wonderful as you can see the various patterns on the costumes, the curtains and just the overall detail of the luxuries around the mansion.  Skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep and simply the detail from the wavy hair of Rupert Friend, to the eyes of Emily Blunt are well-captured in HD.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Young Victoria\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Although \\"The Young Victoria\\" is not an action film that would showcase lossless audio continuously, the film utilizes music and ambiance to full effect.  The music, courtesy of Ilan Eshkeri is brought to full life as the orchestra envelops your soundscape.  Surround channels utilize certain instruments that literally, your room does come alive with the beautiful music.  And as for ambiance, from crowd scenes in which you can hear the crowd gasping as King George IV unleashes on the Duchess of Kent to footsteps, leaves rustling, birds chirping in the outdoor sequences.  Overall, clear lossless audio which works well for this type of film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English and English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Young Victoria: comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * movieIQ and BD-Live - For those who have their Blu-ray player connected to the Internet and can access real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the film.<br />  * Deleted and Extended Scenes -  Featuring 17 deleted/extended sequences not included in the final cut of the film.<br />  * Making of the Young Victoria - (5:42) The talent talk about how much Victoria loved Albert and the things she had created and left in memorium for her husband.

Featuring excerpts from Victoria's diary and to show us a little about the real Queen Victoria.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />As a reviewer who has enjoyed films that have dealt with royalty, especially when done very well, \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a film that looks incredible and you can't help but being enamored by how much was dedicated into making this film look authentic by making sure the cast and many, many extras were dressed to the style of that era but also capturing the look of the royal palace.<br /><br />For one, it helps that you have a producer like Sarah Ferguson, who is familiar with royalty to produce the film and also having the drive to make this movie come alive.  And also, writer Julian Fellowes, who wanted to make sure that as much of Victoria's past is captured in the film.  It's important to note that there are situations from the film that were dramatized for the film (there is an incident in which Prince Albert is shot but this never happened in real life) and a few things that were not exact (ie. during King George's unleashing on Duchess of Kent, the Duchess was seated next to him, not several chairs down and that afterward, the Duchess including her daughter Victoria were reduced to tears).<br /><br />Personally, with so much negativity focused on the relationships of royalty, I felt that it was pretty good to see a film that covered a royal family in which the King and her husband were very much in love.  Victoria's love for Albert is well-known in the UK for her creating various institutions in honor of her husband and other things detailing Victoria's unconditional love Albert that were covered in the film.<br /><br />This is not a film that focuses too much on the politics but focuses on the love of Victoria and Albert and thus, for those looking for something deeper than that may be disappointed.  Case in point, film critic Mick LaSalle of sfgate.com writes, \\"Still, if you want to hate \\"The Young Victoria,\\" you'll have to work at it. Even at its worst (all the many scenes of Victoria and Albert kissing and rolling around in bed) it's diverting in a soap opera way. If you really want to see this movie, don't let me talk you out of it.\\"<br /><br />It appears that LaSalle was slightly invidious towards the film and the emotional and love story aspect of the film made him consider this film as kitsch.  But aside from his assessment, he was not going to enjoy the film because of its relationship angle. Personally, \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a film about a relationship of two people who love each other.  Yes, the two have a scene rolling around in bed but it's not long nor is it a major focal point in the film that makes the film seem soap-operish at all.<br /><br />Ty Burr, film critic of the Boston Globe, gives a better explanation of why he doesn't like the film.  Burr explains, \\"It's a muddled but plush experience overall, and if you're a royalist completist or a historical romantic, you'll probably have a decent time.\\"<br /><br />Burr goes on to say, \\"But the role calls for a good dollop of British royal naivete, and Blunt, to be blunt, can't dull her edges enough to play it. We never really believe Sir John or Lord Melbourne or King Leopold constitutes a threat to this girl and, without that, any dramatic suspense evaporates into topiary and velvet.\\"<br /><br />I accept Burr's review in the fact that \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a plush experience that romantics will fall in love with.  It is a very good film that focuses on that but in terms of Emily Blunt's performance, I felt Blunt and also Rupert Friend had tremendous chemistry and both did a wonderful job.  I felt Blunt was more appropriate in her role versus and her performance was actually quite radiant.  It's important to note that Victoria was a woman who literally grew up with no childhood.  She was literally raised with a strict upbringing and one can wonder, how was she at a young age.<br /><br />And where other royalty films focus on the monarchy, \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a film that doesn't focus too much on the monarchy that people can identify in the characters of Victoria and Albert.<br /><br />But I suppose when it comes to dramatic suspense, I must digress as it is true that perhaps the film does not have much in terms of dramatic suspense (thus, the need for the writer to include a false scene involving Albert and an assassin) was needed.  I suppose if earlier in the film, there were more scenes that focused on Victoria's upbringing by the \\"Kensington System\\" that we could have some sort of feeling of why she had a true disdain towards her mother and Sir John Conroy.  But needless to say, by the time Victoria's a grown up woman about to become a queen, the viewer has less interest in Queen Victoria's mother and Conroy and are more focused on if Albert can win the affection of Victoria.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Young Victoria\\" was a beautiful, romantic film.  On Blu-ray, the visual details on the picture quality was gorgeous and the music via lossless was beautiful to the ears.  In some way, because of the context of the film being a romantic film, I felt there was no need to focus too much on the polemicizing.  The film doesn't ask for anyone to be an erudite on royalty but for one to enjoy a good ol' romantic film based on the true love between Queen Victoria and Albert, royalty but also real people who truly loved each other - nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!er things detailing Victoria's unconditional love Albert that were covered in the film.

1594133379|5.0|A fascinating and instructive description of stroke and recovery by a brain scientist who sufferred a stroke in her 30's.  One of the best books I have read on a true medical crisis. Everyone needs to know what to do when you or someone near you suffers a stroke.  This book spells it out.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|\\"Avatar\\", the largest-grossing movie of all time and has cemented James Cameron's status as a writer and director who has been able to surpass his original box office record with his 1997 film \\"Titanic\\".<br /><br />Created with an outstanding budget of $237 million, needless to say that James Cameron has laid it all on the line with this film.  It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine.  And sure enough, \\"Avatar\\" has become the latter.  The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece.  Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, \\"Avatar\\" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video.  Detail and colors are just amazing.  The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection.  You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters.  How do they do that?  There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.<br /><br />And it just doesn't stop there.  There is detail everywhere.  From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.<br /><br />This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs.  I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but \\"Avatar\\" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray.  Incredible!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And you think that \\"Avatar\\" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for \\"Avatar\\" is equally fantastic!<br /><br />Immersive.  This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged.  Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of \\"Avatar\\" makes those scenes come alive.  The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.<br /><br />Again... Incredible!<br /><br />As for subtitles, \\"Avatar\\" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When \\"Avatar\\" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.<br /><br />It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see asci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch.  Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's \\"Intolerance\\" but when I saw the trailer for \\"Avatar\\", I was sensing CG eye candy ala \\"Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen\\".<br /><br />With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that \\"Avatar\\" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight.  It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema.  But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with \\"Titanic\\", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Avatar\\" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film.  What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer.  Without it becoming an all eye candy film.<br /><br />Well, let's just say that after I watched \\"Avatar\\", I was blown away.  Yes, \\"Avatar\\" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it.  Films such as the \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds.  That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about \\"Avatar\\".<br /><br />Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, \\"Avatar\\" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi.  Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet.  Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.<br /><br />The detail of this film is amazing.  On Blu-ray, it's fantastic!  The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect.  The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced.  I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (\\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case.  Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.<br /><br />The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well.  And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in \\"Avatar\\" is a nostalgic blessing.  She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the \\"Alien\\" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.<br /><br />In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing.  What the \\"Star Wars\\" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, \\"Avatar\\" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fifilms today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).<br /><br />But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read \\"Salon\\" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.  Zacherek writes, \\"The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is  a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.\\"<br /><br />I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement.  The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world.  Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with \\"Titanic\\", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film.  But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing.  The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal.  And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, \\"Avatar\\" was deserving in winning \\"Best Achievement in Art Direction\\", \\"Best Achievement in Cinematography\\" and \\"Best Achievement in Visual Effects\\".<br /><br />She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action.  You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi.  It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences.  And the \\"godawful dialogue\\", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for \\"Avatar\\", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.<br /><br />But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that \\"Village Voice\\" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well.  Hoberman writes, \\"For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.\\"<br /><br />I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films.  Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Avatar\\" is comparing apples to oranges.  Where both films feature a revolt, \\"Metropolis\\" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors.  In \\"Avatar\\", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight.  And what kind of film would \\"Avatar\\" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?<br /><br />The second half needed that battle and like \\"Metropolis\\", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right!  That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.<br/><br />So, I came away enjoying \\"Avatar\\" much more than I expected.  The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality.  Special features are none but similar to \\"Sin City\\" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to \\"Avatar\\".  I am sure like the video releases of \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of \\"Avatar\\".  This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.<br /><br />I know many people may hold off until the better version of \\"Avatar\\" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy \\"Avatar\\" now, you can.  James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc.  Although, this is not the ultimate release of \\"Avatar\\" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, \\"Avatar\\" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Highly recommended!ed to read \\"Salon\\" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I bought a class set of this book for my 8th graders who are mostly Latino and who read at about the third grade level.  I have never seen such an overwhelmingly positive response to a book.  Everyday when they enter the classroom they ask, \\"Are we reading that book today?\\"  They are listening to the [...] version while they read along. I would also recommend that version, the actors are excellent and the Mexicano accent is perfect (I have been told by my students).  This book is full of vulgar language (in Spanish and English), sexual situations, and gang violence, but it is honest and the message is positive.  My students say they love this book because it portrays their world accurately and because the plot is compelling.  They can't put it down.  Many would say that 14 is too young to read this book, but I have a class full of students who experience this language and these situations everyday at home and in their neighborhood. For many of them, this is the first time in their life that they have loved reading a book.
B0036EH40Q|4.0|1993 and it was the battle between two films based on the iconic western figure Wyatt Earp.  Screenwriter Kevin Jarre (\\"The Mummy\\", \\"Glory\\", \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\") and Kevin Costner were originally set to make the film together but due to a disagreement, Costner would go on to film \\"Wyatt Earp\\" while Kevin Jarre would take his script to Buena Vista for distribution and sure enough, it became a contest of sorts as who would get their movie out first and which one would dominate in the box office.<br /><br />Fortunately, despite numerous problems on the set of \\"Tombstone\\", if there is one thing that the film had was its all-star cast as Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestly, Dana Delany, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, Terry O'Quinn and many more.<br /><br />Directing the film would be George P. Cosmatos (\\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\", \\"Leviathan\\", \\"Shadow Conspiracy\\"), cinematography by William A. Fraker (\\"Rules of Engagement\\", \\"Father of the Bride Part II\\", \\"Street Fighter\\") and music by Bruce Broughton (\\"Lost in Space\\", \\"Bambi II\\", \\"Tiny Toon Adventures\\").<br /><br />In the end, \\"Tombstone\\"earned $56 million domestically and did much better than Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" in the box office.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Tombstone\\" is presented in 1080 High Definition (2:35:1).  For the most part, the good news is that \\"Tombstone\\" looks very good on Blu-ray.  The cinematography by William A. Fraker is absolutely beautiful during some of the scenic shots overlooking the fields, the skyline, dusk and dawn.  While many parts of the film showcases many colors and for the most part, detail of the town, the saloon, the skin pores, etc. look great on Blu-ray, I noticed that the scenes look a bit dark at times.  I haven't had the chance to compare with the original DVD release of \\"Tombstone\\" but there are times that seem as if shots were taken during overcast or the shadows of the hats are covering the faces of people.<br /><br />But despite the dark look of some scenes, \\"Tombstone\\" definitely looks sharper and more contrast is seen on the Blu-ray release and blacks are nice and deep. Only one scene which was stock video where you a bit of aliasing but for the most part, I didn't detect any major artifacts or blemishes.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Tombstone\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit), French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Audio dialogue is quite clear and for the most part, the majority of the film is dialogue driven until you get into short action scenes at the O.K. Corral and the final half hour in which the film starts to have more action-based scenes.  But one of the things that you will notice is the use of the surrounds in terms of capturing the ambiance of the outdoor scenes.  I was watching when Wyatt and Josie were horseriding and are taking a break and all of a sudden I started hearing birds chirping and rustling the trees.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Also, you will hear the thunderstorms come to life and of course, the gun battle sequences in which you hear rifle shots, gun shots and more.  Overall, \\"Tombstone\\" sounds very good via lossless.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, English ESL, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Tombstone\\" comes with the following special features in 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital audio and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Included are:<br /><br />  * The Making of Tombstone - (27:19) This featurette goes into the cast of Tombstone as they talk about their characters and filming a Western. Director George P. Cosmatos talking about making an authentic Western and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.<br />  * Director's Original Storyboards - (4:00) A special feature showcasing the original storyboards of Director George P. Cosmatos.<br />  * Trailers and TV Spots - Featuring two theatrical trailers (:60 and :120) and the \\"Friends\\" TV spot (:30).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Tombstone\\" is an enjoyable film and for those who enjoy Westerns and for those who like the stories of lawmen vs. the outlaws, the film is quite entertaining and a storyline in which both Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer actually do a remarkable job. Russell as the Wyatt Earp, the caring brother and also not afraid of anyone!  And Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday at his most charming and also his most vulnerable and how Kilmer plays off the sickly version of Holliday is really well-done.<br /><br />But what I did enjoy about \\"Tombstone\\" when I first watched it over a decade ago, was how it tried to capture the life of Wyatt Earp and led to the \\"Gunfight of O.K. Corral\\" and \\"Wyatt Earp and the Immortals\\".  Granted, the film is not exactly historically accurate and the adaptation would be of what took place had to receive the Hollywood touch but for the most part, it did capture many of the stories that took place especially with Virgil Earp becoming a marshal, some of the battles that took place and more.<br /><br />If there was one thing that I was hoping for, it would be a more climactic battle between Wyatt and Curly Bill Brocius.  With Brocius being the leader of the Cowboys, I felt that the battle between both men was rather short.  Also, there were some scenes of certain characters that felt out of place and this goes with the troubled production as the original screenplay was longer and had a story emphasizing sub-plots of the various characters but was nixed.  The fact that \\"Tombstone\\" has quite a bit of starpower, I just felt that certain characters were never utilized and if they were, what was the purpose.  For example, why was Deputy Billy Breckinridge (played by Jason Priestly) even shown and also, with no historical fact towards his sexuality, why was she shown to have gay tendencies?  Also, the character of Sherman McMasters (played by Michael Rooker), just an added scene showing why he broke off with the Cowboys would have been nice to see as well.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, the film definitely looks and sounds better than its predecessor.  It's important to note that the Blu-ray version features the 130-minute version and not the 135-minute director's cut version of \\"Tombstone\\".  Missing is the audio commentary by director George P. Cosmatos and also \\"The Tombstone Epitaph - Actual Newspaper Account\\" featured in the Director's Cut Televista DVD version.  But the making-of featurette, director's original storyboards and trailers remain intact.  But you can't help but be pleased with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Tombstone\\" was an enjoyable Western that I have seen a good number of times.  Does it rank high compared to the best Western's out there?  Definitely not but in my opinion, it's the best Wyatt Earp film that I have seen yet and it's a film that I just found enjoyable from beginning to end.  Definitely recommended!for those who enjoy Westerns and for those who like the stories of lawmen vs. the outlaws, the film is quite entertaining and a storyline in which both Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer actually do a remarkable job.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I only became aware of this product category after noticing the horrible, cringe-inducing sounds coming from my keyboard during some intense gaming sessions on my PC. I soon decided that I was the just the kind of person that could get suckered into buying one of these units.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did. The build quality is great. Logitech knows how to build peripherals. At first, the number of keys immediately available to your fingers may be a bit overwhelming, but like most things, your experience/performance will improve with practice. I ended up drawing a representation of the keypad on a piece of paper I could keep in front of me during gameplay and labeled which commands or macros I'd assigned to each key. That really helped for the first week and then I found myself not needing to consult it anymore. It'd have been nice if Logitech had included a couple paper or cardstock templates like this for you to 'plan' profiles out and then use for reference while getting used to them. Or, include the ability to print out your profile maps?<br /><br />The only thing I dislike about this keypad is that the glow color of the LCD is changeable. Every once in a while, I'll sit down at my computer only to find out that my kids have changed it to pink.
0307473708|4.0|Overall this is a great book, at times it's a little hard to tell if Dexter is talking outloud or in his subcouncious... In the beginning it follows the TV Series almost word for word, but a couple chapters in it starts to go into a different direction... I liked it, I think that the Tv Series explored the Ice Truck Killer a bit deeper, and I prefer the outcome in the series rather then what they did in the book, but in the end it was nice to read something a bit different then what I have already seen... Now I'm moving on to book #2
B0017JKEL8|5.0|As discussed in the establishing of mad men, I agree with their comments that the series, especially the pilot was well written.  Mad Men pulls you into the world of advertising during the early 60s.  I loved the witty dialogues, incredible lighting and meticulous in the accuracy of the setting and props.  I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a look on the world of advertising and the men behind it.
0374532125|4.0|I found Dead Aid to be a very nice, concise review of an emerging view that aid is as effective as it is meant to be.  I especially was interested to read about Moyo's view, being that she received her education in economics from Harvard and Oxford and that she has worked for the World Bank and Goldman Sachs.  Some people have criticized that her argument is weak, but the fact is, this book has gained much popular review, which, in my opinion is a great thing because it is raising the question of how effective aid actually is.  In addition, this is obviously an issue that donor countries and agencies have been concerned with in recent years--just look at the Monterrey Consensus and Paris Declaration, which both aim to improve aid effectiveness.  Overall, I recommend reading this book to gain an insight on some solutions to African development based on economic tools such as the bond market.
B0036RPM8E|5.0|Great quality dvd. Seller was fantastic and dvd even arrived prior to scheduled delivery date.
B00127RAJY|4.0|i love this product. it is easy to follow and i love the encouragement from Jillian
B002VPE1AW|1.0|This is very disappointing. Once, the movie costs in Germany at Amazon 7.98 Euros ($11.71), second, I expected at least some special features, like interviews or making of. Again it seems the producing company can't get enough. There will be an \\"ultimate version\\" in November to get even more money from stupid buyers like me. That \\"ultimate version\\" will porbably have the same movie and five minutes of special features. Thanks for nothing, could have bought the movie at Comcast for $4.99 and record it on my DVD recorder.
B0017M8XS6|1.0|I am one of the few people (the rest of you know who you are) who believe that SACD has been the missed opportunity that audio fans and music lovers who don't want to be bothered with vinyl were waiting for. So with that in mind, I really purchased this for the SACD portion of the set. I am of an age that I remember ELP at their peak and always hoped to get a great digital remaster of one or all of their best recordings. As far as the SACD disc goes this is not it. In fact it is by far the worst SACD I have ever purchased, popular or classical.     I own two of the best SACD players ever built, the Sony SCD-XA9000ES and the Marantz reference player. I first decided to preview the SACD disc on the Sony using the headphone jack and my Sennheiser HD600s. The sound on the first track Jerusalem was so bad- literally distorted, that I thought there was a problem with the player or the headphones. I switched to the Marantz and my Sony MDR-F1 headphones and it sounded even worse! At that moment I realized I should have taken some of the negative reviews more seriously. Although some of the later tracks on the SACD disc are better, overall in is bad, just bad. It is an embarrassment that any studio engineer and any recording label actually issued this disc.    The CDs are good, not great, but listenable. But if you were hoping for the full SACD experience that was possible for ELP you will be bitterly disappointed.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I had to jump on here and give \\"The Resistance\\" a 5 star review.  Had to.  Why?  Because it's so incredibly obvious.  To think otherwise is either ignorant, misinformed, or plain stupid.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|This trilogy is a must have for Blu Ray player owners. If you have not seen them yet I would recommend them. Great action movies that are geared to be more realistic and not so over the top.
006092988X|3.0|A book worthy of praise for its historical detail, although for me the writing wasn't top-notch.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|GREAT MOVIE. Funny, sarcastic, romantic and thrilling. A fantastic joy-ride into the mind of a legend. A new take on an old favorite! A must see for everyone, Robert Downey Jr. is a magician, a mastermind, and monstrously intelligent, very sweet and GORGEOUS. And don't forget about Jude Law! They are the ultimate duo! Rachel McAdams is a total babe, a vixen. She's cunning and clever, the perfect leading lady.
0439023483|1.0|I only read the first chapter of this book.  It was so disgusting that I returned it with out reading more.  I did ask someone who read the whole thing and they said that it really was about what I thought it was.  It's basically about children ages 12 to 18 who have to go and kill each other to get the reward of food for their tribe.  I was horrified by this concept and can't believe it is a young adult book.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites of all time. The twist at the end was incredible, and the music is intense. The best part of this is that it comes at a price of under ten dollars! At this price maybe more people will fall in love with the franchise and make this new Batman even more popular. [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]]]
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed Reading Dear John. In a nutshell, the story follows a twenty three year old in the military who met the girl of his dreams at the beach: Savannah Lynn Curtis. They are together for a few years and then after 9/11, he decides to stay in the army and she ends up with her best friend.     ________________________________________________________________________________________________________    The beginning of the book was lovely. I have never been so engaged in a book. Their connection is magical and when they were together it felt so natural to me. From the first day they met at the beach, and when they went back to 'the house' for Barbecue, to when they went to the hamburger joint or the shrimp shack. You could tell that they were truly in love with each other. They wanted to spend every moment together. She takes him to the house her and her college friends are building, and tells him that she had almost been raped and that she hadn't really been with anyone in a long time. She also tells John she loves him for the first time.     One afternoon, John goes looking for her and finds her at the pier, crying her eyes out. Basically, she was sad about him returning to Germany and leaving her. But she also gives him a book and states her belief that his father had asperger's. He didn't take it too well, and stormed off, and ended up getting into a fight with Randy, but punched Tim, Savannah's best friend in the whole wide world, in the nose.     Savannah takes John's leaving hard, but promised to write to him, and that she did.     *When John returned to North Carolina their chemistry was still strong, but less so than it was in the beginning. They fight a little because John doesn't like her taking him to see her friends all of the time. He got real mad one evening when she came home late from teaching. That night, they make love for the first time, and the spark is rekindled.     *They John's dad has heart attacks and gets sick, bed ridden practically. It breaks John's heart, but grows closer to his father and comes to appreciated their relationship more than he had. While back in Germany, after a few months, John gets a 'Dear John' letter. He is crushed to learn she has fallen in love with another man. Then his Dad dies and he arranged the funeral, and ends up in Lenoir, and after many years, sees Savannah at her home feeding the horses. It really upset me that they were still so in love with each other, but couldn't be together. She ended up marrying Tim by the way, which was very annoying. She should have waited for John. He is in the Hospital with Melanoma and is getting treated for it. Savannah tells John about how sad it is, and everything. They end up almost kissing, and then he sees her naked. That killed me. I knew they both wanted to be together and her choice to marry Tim was even more annoying. WHY DIDN'T SHE WAIT FOR JOHN? I know it's morbid, but i was hoping Tim would die and they would end up together, but they didn't.     Their last words are spoken in a parking lot, and they never hear from each other again. I really enjoyed this book. It was the first Romance novel i ever read, and am starting The notebook. I am also looking forward to watching Dear john the movie!
B0038M61B4|4.0|To clarify comments made about an earlier version of this album:<br /><br />None of the tracks on \\"Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane\\" are live.  Not all are in Mono.  The sound ranges from Good to Very Good, especially considering these tracks date to 1957.  The 2010 re-issue includes a bonus 7th track, \\"Monk's Mood,\\" recorded a little earlier than tracks 1-6.<br /><br />There's a Blue Note release of Monk and Coltrane that was recorded live on low-quality equipment, and the sound is terrible.  Die-hard fans who want to hear every note their hero played may find lo-fi releases acceptable, but I don't.  Don't confuse that Blue Note release with this one---the Jazzland OJC CD has been restored and the sonics are much better.<br /><br />These tracks may not be Monk's best, but his compositions are profoundly affecting.  This release is well worth picking up.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|First I was a bit disappointed in Slash's solo record but since I love most of his previous work I kept listening. And after maybe three or four times it really grow on me. I really like it now and I hope more people gives it a chance and don't give up on it. I live in Sweden so I don't know if his tour is coming to Scandinavia but if it does I will be there cause this is an amazing record. Don't miss out on it.
B000024EXY|5.0|I have only seen them twice in concert and every time i did they put on a show that is hard to forget.<br /><br />This CD showcases the tour they did for Trick of the Tail. I am sure it was as fantastic as the two shows i saw.<br /><br />The only down point i could possably give this CD is that it doesn't have Phil's talking between the songs. That is part of the show they cut out and it is missed. Phil is an excelent stage pressence and it should have been put in.<br /><br />While hil is out front singing (in the recetly gone Peter Gabrial's place) Chester Thompson ( and on one track Bill Bruford from YES) play the drums<br /><br />this tour did have Steve Hacket on guitars and shortly after he went missing for a solo career.<br /><br />Mike Ruthaford and Tony Banks are there too
B00000K2VZ|5.0|The CD arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. Great experience!!  FYI I tried to tag the product as \\"recommended\\" and nothing responded , I clicked everything.   So either email me back to give me a clue about how to respond to this or you just wont get one.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This movie is my absolute favorite of Wong Kar Wai.    The visuals are stunning, the actors are great, and its twisted and sadistic and yet still turns out to be a tender love story . Wong Kar-Wai's use of slow mo on So's gloved hand while walking in the street is an image that I could stop and rewind and stop and rewind a thousand times over and never tire of it...    It's simply beautiful...  the music can drown you too...
0307388921|5.0|BETTER THAN FIGHT CLUB, YES, BETTER THAN FIGHT CLUB, I SAY. You will not be able to put this book down. You'll get sucked into the world of Victor Mancini, a sex addict, a museum worker, a supposed disciple of christ. The levels of philosophy and brilliance in this book are amazing, this might be my personal favorite novel. The end is beautiful and surprising to say the least. The twist to the story is completely unsuspected, and takes you by storm. Just read this book. \\"Incredible\\" isn't the right word, but it's the first one to come to mind.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I still love the sequel. Although, the Mexican is a little too over the top and the female FBI agent is just okay, I love the fact that they bring in a little more of Duffy, Dolly and Greenly. I think it flows nice enough and I like the fact that they go more into Il Duce's past. You can't bat 100 percent but this is still a good solid 98%. These movies are fun and you love the guys and cheer them on. Thanks for the sequel and look forward to Number three.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|The stellar cast of Sherlock Holmes unfortunately can't save this Guy Ritchie directed fiasco.  The plot is long and convoluted.  There are some glaring inconsistencies, i.e., in two of Sherlock's fights, he choreographs how he will take his opponent down and yet with another opponent, a huge French adversary, there is no such choreography.  It all so seems to go on forever.
B002VECM72|5.0|The Blind Side is one of the best movies of the year.  It came in, in pristine condition and in a very timely manner.  I would definitely buy from this vendor again.  Again, great, great movie!!!!
0810993139|5.0|All though I am much older than the regular age required reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid, it gives excellent life lesson points.  Greg plays a great role, completely believes that he is of the many weird kids in his school the cool one.  Although he was against the whole diary concept he believes that \\"this book is gonna come in handy... [he'll] be famous one day.\\" (Kinney 2)  Greg is an extra ordinary guy who seeks adventure. This book is hilarious and thrilling as you meet the funny characters including his BFF Rowley and the weirdo kid Fregley who Greg never seems to understand.     We are or know someone, like Greg, who's the wimpy kid.  He doesn't fit in and you know that he going to pick on and feel's as though he stands out in a crowd well that is what exactly how many of us might feel when we are at Greg's age.  The author, Jeff Kinney, did an excellent job telling the story of a 7th grader that we can relate to.  It's not like your everyday story boy meets girl!!! But when you read it you feel a sense of connection as though you know exactly what he's talking about.      Greg faces situations like bullies and teachers that just don't fit him and friends that ha can't relate to.  Somehow he survives the years in middle school and never touches the \\"Cheese Touch.\\"(Even though as of today we still don't know who touched it)
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Started on Monday; last night (Wednesday) I converted 11 songs flawlessly in about 80 minutes.  So, there is a progression in learning this but it pays off.    The turntable does feel....well, a little cheap with all of the plastic present but results matter and the end quality of the sound is excellent.  It has had trouble in tracking a couple of the older vinyl pieces I had but since we are talking about old 45's that haven't seen light or a disc cleaner in 35 years (and may not have worked that well to begin with), I can live with that.  Still, the ones I converted last night - albums from the late 70's and early 80's - sound terrific.  It's a thrill to give all these tracks new life.    Now, the enclosed Sony software.    Documentation stinks.  But, this software is a little intuitive especially if you've worked with something similar like Direct Cut.  Once the song is in place, you can click-and-drag to highlight segments and then apply various effects to them.  Last night, I waited too long to push pause and caught a soft note from a second song that I didn't want to transfer.  No problem - I highlighted the last ten seconds of the track, went to the menu and found the \\"fade out\\" function in the menus and BAM! the software allowed the track to fade gently off and the unwanted note was unnoticeable.    Most of the other reviews have hit on the particular settings you need to do but I want to emphasize:  a.  This does work with Windows 7.  b.  Go to \\"tools\\" in sound forge and click \\"vinyl recording and restoration\\" then click \\"Device Properties\\".  Highlight the USB Audio Codec and then click on Properties at the bottom of the box. Click on the Levels tab and drag the slide to set level at 1 or 2 at most. Press ok. Sound reproduction is great after this.  Anything higher than 2 is unlistenable.    Finally, while my HP laptop has good speakers they are nowhere near the quality of some powered computer speakers I owe.  The turntable has a switch on the back that you flip to \\"line\\" (instead of phono).  I bought this here at Amazon    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006U3ACY/    and have hooked the phono line on one side and the computer speakers on the other side - and I have great, rich sound without having to disrupt the horrendous, overwhelming wiring pit that is the back of my in-wall, audio system.    So, overall, a buy well worth it - after the learning curve!
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliott Smith was an extraordinary musician. This album is diverse -- every facet of the artist is here, all that he'd known and learned through the years: you'll find it here.    There are songs like oracles, eerily predicting the future. And songs that sound fully alive and intending to remain that way.    This man's ability to convey such intensely personal feelings and observations in few words and his complex guitar work...mind-boggling. I've tried to figure it out, decipher the tunings, but it's as though he wrote the tunes and the guitar was played through some native encryption method...he was one of those rare unicorns, often compared to Nick Drake. The difference is, Elliott Smith didn't have the delicacy -- he'd seen quite a bit and wasn't sugar-coating the experience. And he didn't have a persistent depressive feel, despite the sadness conveyed in his voice. This is in no way intended to denigrate Nick Drake, as he was also quite astonishing.    It is simply saying (IMHO): Elliott expressed anger and angst and surprise at some of the idiocy and beauty and mediocrity he encountered or was accosted by. Nick expressed a sense of being a misunderstood person who never felt quite at ease in his body and in this world. It is the quality of their voices and a talent (sometimes a curse) for introspection they had most in common.    I bought this CD used, through an Amazon Seller. So *technically*, the purchase was made here on Amazon. It was an unmitigated bargain. I'd considered purchasing this CD for *years*, but like many people stuck to the \\"Earlier Elliott\\". I'm so happy I gave \\"FABOTH\\" a chance...I'd have missed so very much.    So? Don't get stuck in the early groove and ignore the evolution of the artist. Here was something beautiful I hadn't heard, but really needed to hear. Maybe that's true of you, too. Take the leap and give it a chance. I sincerely doubt you'll regret buying this album -- more likely, you'll regret the time you spent avoiding it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in years.  Sandra Bullock was great and at the end of the movie you felt great!
B001HN6940|5.0|I was never a fan of the original Alice -- not as a book (despite some brilliant bits), never as a movie (ugh). I am a fan of Burton.    This update, simply, rocks. Better than any Alice before.     Amazing visual effects -- the environment, the Queen of Heart's Army and the Queen herself! I loved Bonham Carter (huge fan since Fight Club and Sweeney Todd) and I especially love her makeup artist (Clara Bow, eat your heart out -- these are lips!) And who figured out how to distort the Red Queen's body?! And good work on the Cheshire Cat, guys!    Honestly, I didn't love the Jabberwock -- too much like Enchanted's awful CG dragon which was too much like too many other CG dragons in too many other special effects movies. Only Shrek has managed to make a CG dragon that works, and that's even given Dreamwork's awful 3D work. That said, the final battle actually worked well.    Depp's gay (again), but I didn't mind. His Mad Hatter is a lovely person and, like Bonham Carter, a visual treat.    I even found myself liking Anne Hathaway and I really don't like Anne Hathaway.    All in all, despite the unfortunate CG Jabberwock, a truly frabjous outing.
B001AQUR7O|5.0|One of the best things about Sade is their inability to be categorized musically. Elements of jazz, funk, soul, pop, chillout, and world music make up the mix that only begins to describe Sade's sound. The half British/half Nigerian honey-throated Helen Folasade Adu sporting her blood red lips and signature pontyail took the music world by storm with the assistance of Stuart Matthewman's sax and guitar, Paul Denman's bass, and Andrew Hale's keyboard and they've never stopped. This is a perfect compilation of their first decade's work. From the bossa nova hit Smooth Operator and the tropical breeze of The Sweetest Taboo to the underwater rhythm of No Ordinary Love and love drunk jazz of Kiss of Life, all the hits are featured. Non singles like Jezebel, Like A Tattoo, and the bluesy Please Send Me Someone To Love are also thrown in as special treats. Sampled by rappers (Krayzie Bone), covered by rockers (Deftones), and admired by pop stars (Beyonce and Christina Aguilera), Sade continues to follow the beat of their own drum and we wouldn't have it any other way.

The melodies are really catchy and stick with you after you turn off the CD player. This isn't the kind of music you can put on in the background while you are cooking, cleaning, etc. It wants you to sit down, close your eyes, and listen to every nuance of the sound.

044656740X|1.0|I read this book approximately three years ago to see what all the fuss was about. I still do not know what the fuss is about. It is incredible that a person of Oprah's stature would recommend this crap to the mass public. If you have in your possession one iota of a neuron, you would briskly see why his \\"lessons\\" are BS. I use the term \\"lessons\\" very loosely. His statements of \\"how to live\\" are followed by non-sequitor \\"proof.\\" He is contradictory in every respect as well. He states that a formal education is a waste of time, a home is not an assest, passive income is key, don't buy do doodads, etc. Well, Kiosaki has a formal education, he has two multimillion dollar homes in the Phoenix area, he is still working busting his arse on the lecture circuit, he owns multiple luxury cars, etc. He is a total fake and insulting to his readers.

B00003CXXP|4.0|In a futuristic world where humans and robots coexist in a shaky relationship, a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) is taught to love and is given to a family. Being the first of his kind he is sorely misunderstood and a series of unfortunate events leads to David being on the run. All David wants is to be a real boy, though, and be loved by his mommy Monica (Frances O'Conner). So with his new found friend, Love Bot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), David travels out to find the Blue Fairy of Pinochio fame to make him a real boy so his mother will love him.    AI was originally the brain child of legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, but as he was working on it he felt that the sensibilities of the film better suited a filmmaker such as Steven Spielberg. Stanley Kubrick approached Spielberg with the idea that Kubrick would produce the film, and Spielberg would direct. Of course, Spielberg was excited at the chance, but also reticent at the fact that this was the brainchild of the great Stanley Kubrick. They worked and worked on the project, Kubrick even had voices recorded that eventually appeared in the finished product (including those recorded by Chris Rock, Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and even Jack Angel who performed the voice of Teddy) until Kubrick had much of the concept art and even the complete treatment. Eventually Spielberg pushed back and asked Kubrick to direct and he would produce, and Kubrick relented but was unable to film the movie prior to his death in March of '99. Out of respect for his friend for the project he was originally asked to do, Spielberg picked up the work on AI and finished the film that Kubrick spent more than 12 years visualizing.    AI is a flawed masterpiece. Combining the strengths of two very different filmmakers is definitely the way to create an interesting work, and bringing out the sentimentality of Spielberg and the cynicism of Kubrick makes for great interplay and a certain tension between the two different sensibilities. On the one side you have the power and endurance of love, and on the other side you have the moral dilemma of man playing god and than dehumanizing it's creation. When juggling these two images of modern society Spielberg is at his best, and most of the movie is as good, if not better than anything else the director has ever commited to film.    The acting in this film is superb. Most of the movie revolves around Haley Joel Osment who was in his prime at the time (an unfortunate thing to say for a talent so young at the time and so good), and does he shine. Playing the first of his kind to feel love (or is it obsession) you truly feel for a robots plight, one of the few movies to actually grab you in that way. As his companion through most of his plight, you can tell Jude Law as Gigolo Joe is having a blast giving his \\"Love Bot\\" (read: sex toy) a bit of the smooth edge of Fred Astair. All of the performances in this movie truly shine though.    The problem, and what makes this movie flawed, is Spielberg's recent obsession with overindulgence and the need to place pieces from his older movies in his newer movies where they don't belong. First off, the ending of the movie should have been cut off. I'm not typically the type of person who will hold anything against a long movie, and it's not that this movie is long, it's that the last half hour is completely unneeded and somewhat ridiculous. Some of the acting choices make the last 30 minutes really feel more like outtakes than an integral part of the film. To add to that though, and secondly, Spielberg felt the need to inject scenes that he had planned for Close Encounters of the Third Kind into the end of the movie, confusing audiences as to what's going on in the end with the alien like robots.    Over all, I have to say that I did enjoy this movie, and it could have very well been a masterpiece and in ways it is, only if Spielberg hadn't followed his need to overindulge this movie wouldn't have lost steam.I do recommend it though, it's a movie that works well on multiple levels, for either just entertainment, or for further exploration into it's deeper meanings.

B002ZG983M|5.0|Dave Linewski (Aaron Johnson) is your everyday average 17 year old nerd. Girls don't notice him, thugs steal his money, him and his friends sit out around at comic book shops reading comics and talking about girls and why people never become superheroes. After getting fed up with the crime in his city, though, Dave decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes his own masked hero: Kick-Ass, and becomes a local web and news sensation. Things aren't as easy as they seem for a juvenile crime fighter as he soon finds out, luckily he makes friends in the form of Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), a Batman-like vigilante, and his 11-year-old sidekick Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who aren't adverse to the idea of literally taking out the scum of the earth. But when members of his crew start turning up dead, drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a price on Kick-Ass's head.    Mark Millar is an acclaimed comic writer best known for Wanted (which became the movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy) and his take on an alternate reality where Kal-El landed in the Soviet Union instead of America called Superman: Red Son. For Kick-Ass, Millar went back to conversations him and his brother had about becoming masked vigilantes, and took the conversation a step further and looked into what would actually happen if a teenager actually decided to take that step. As Millar got working on that comic, he also started working with Matthew Vaughn (director of Layer Cake, producer for Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells) on some early ideas for Thor, but when Vaughn left Thor he started talking to Millar about his other comics. What started out as a plan to adapt American Jesus (Millar's sequel to the Bible) soon turned to conversations about Millar's still in the planning stage Kick-Ass.    Kick-Ass is the anti-comic book comic book movie. It skewers the genre while also paying loving homage to them. It would be all to easy to say it's a spoof of the genre, because while at times it may poke fun at the genre (remember that scene in Spider-Man where Peter Parker runs across a rooftop and jumps to the next roof, there's a spoof of that) it still also takes it's place amongst it's comic book peers with all seriousness. Kick-Ass is a very dark movie, not afraid of withholding the violence that a choice of vigilante crime fighting will lead to, even if that means beating an 11-year-old girl. This is graciously offset by a lot of comedy, chances are if you're not cringing from people's limbs getting hacked off or their heads exploding (yes there is one scene where that actually does happen) you'll be laughing hysterically. Not to mention pointing out to yourself homages to other comic book iterations (the aforementioned rofftop run, Big Daddy's Adam West like cadence when talking in the suit, Kick-Ass in an alley staring up at a wall as if about to scale it like Peter Parker, etc.)    The acting in the movie is phenomenal. Nicholas Cage hasn't been this good in years, and I was personally surprised to find out Aaron Johnson, who plays the title character, is actually a Brit. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Role Models) continues to surprise, considering most actors his age would have been typecast by a role like McLovin, and his arc actually did surprise having seen all of the trailers and promotional material for the movie prior to seeing the movie. The movie, though, is completely stolen by Chloe Moretz ((500) Days of Summer) as the foul mouthed, butt kicking 11-year-old Hit Girl. She plays the role with such force that you genuinely believe that full grown men, mafiosos, would be afraid of this 11-year-old girl.    Naturally, this movie isn't for everyone, as we've seen from the brouhaha that's erupted for a little girl uttering the \\"C-word\\", but this is one movie I think it's rewarding to see below the surface. There's a certain hint of satire in it's brutality meeted out by a child, and a certain tone in the movie that chastises us for not being more involved in helping those around us, while also showing it's understanding of why we sometimes choose not to. I honestly can say that I can find nothing wrong with this movie, and I'm currently considering adding it to my top 10 all-time favorites list. I highly recommend that you give it a try!    5/5
B0033PSH4U|5.0|It is amazing that they stop making a DVD of this movie and I am thankful that Amazon listen to their customers and I hope that they will do more of this.  Now to the movie, De Niro is a his best playing the supporting husband and loving father and to see this side of him, in such a dramatic role, made me appreciate him even more.  Not only him but all the actors in this movie re-enacted the 50's with such authenticity that the suck you in and you fall in love with the good guys and the bad. Chazz was great and I am glad he was able to bring his story to the screen. I love the moral of this story that is finding some type of balance in life which many people today have a difficult time finding.  A&E aired this movie last month and I watch it then as if it was the first time viewing. This movie is definitely a classic one and thanks again Amazon for making this movie, a new DVD, available.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I've been watching Life on Discovery Channel. It's beautifully done. But why the narration is being done by whom science junkies and skeptics widely believe is the number one peddler of pseudoscience is beyond me. Oprah has her strengths. She is personable onscreen and has a gift for emotionally connecting with her audience. She is great to have banter about wrinkle creams, weight loss, and deadbeat dads. But she is hardly the sharpest knife in the drawer and wholly unsuited to lend credibility to a subject such as this.

B0013URJTG|5.0|If you have not yet discovered Porcupine Tree well you should do so real soon and this would not be a bad place to start. I kept hearing of this band on another band's message board (Rush) for a few years and finally decided to give them a listen last fall (Fear Of A Blank Planet)....well I have not stopped listening nor do I see a time when I will! This album I believe came out around 2000 and was a little more concise with the songwriting as opposed to the earlier more spacy 90's stuff. Now I love all of it so I don't care what they release. The highlights on this album to me are the title track, Shesmovedon, Last Chance..., Hatesong, Where Would We Be and Russia on Ice. That's 6 of 10 and if you ask me that's pretty good for any album you would buy! I had heard Lightbulb Sun, Hatesong and Shesmovedon live and wanted to hear the studio versions and they are just as brilliant. Steve Wilson is an absolute genius. I cannot believe it took me so long to find this band. I was ready to write off all \\"rock, prog-rock, popular music\\" so to speak because I could not find anything remotely appealing...to the point I started listening to smooth jazz (which I actually like for the musicianship!). I am rambling now so I will cut this off. If you have read this far and want to discover something much better than the garbage they throw out at you everyday and call it music....purchase everything Porcupine Tree has done and enjoy your musical journey!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|As a fan of the 1995 BBC version, this P&P had to grow on me. It took two watchings to do just that, and I now rate it higher than the older miniseries. Some purists are upset about this modern take (Just read the lower rated reviews), but I think they should at least acknowledge an original attempt at an old novel. And this P&P does just that - breathe new life into a tale everyone knows.    For starters, the imagery in this movie is breathtakingly luscious. Imagine colour so bright and vivid you can almost taste it and amazing country settings that ooze sensuality. It is a very passionate film, in its settings and actors and the chemistry between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen (Elizabeth and Darcy) is a palpable, living entity that reflects in the scenery. (such as Elizabeth's awakening sensuality in the art gallery at Pemberley. And how gorgeous were those statues?) Really, this movie made me want to run out and buy an English country estate for a couple million pounds (which I don't have :)    There are so many great things about this film. The actors are spot-on. Initially I thought Keira too giggly but then I realised that in the book she was a young woman and should act as any other young woman throughout the ages. Tom Hollander's portrayal of Collins is exciting and believable (As a clergyman, he would be very sexually frustrated indeed). Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy sometimes looks a little too sulky for my tastes but that thankfully doesn't take away from his smoldering performance (with such a gorgeous voice to boot). My favs: the scene at Charlotte's house - he literally bursts in and looks so ill at ease you feel sorry for him - the two proposals and strutting across the countryside in the early morning hours!!! Oh my beating heart!!). Mr and Mrs Bennet have a believable marriage and the family's obvious \\"country poverty\\" make it clear why Darcy would have so much difficulty in the initial stages loving Elizabeth.    Unfortunately, it's not quite perfect, hence the half star. There should have been more Elizabeth/Darcy interaction which could have been achieved if they'd taken out some unnecessary shots. It felt sometimes the shot was done for the sake of looking good, rather than contributing anything meaningful to the story. (E.g. the swing scene, the ballroom tracking shot, the shot of Elizabeth standing at the edge of the cliff, the moon shot after Elizabeth and Jane talk in bed - all beautiful to look at but really not that necessary. In addition the talking in the dance scene between Elizabeth and Darcy is a little awkward since some lines are delivered when they're not face to face.    Yet that doesn't take away from what is a fully fleshed out picture with real people, dealing with still relevant problems, instead of recite-lines-from-an-idealised-book characters.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Howard Elias is a highly successful civil rights lawyer whose specialty is suing the Los Angeles Police Department on behalf of those the cops have mistreated, which (naturally) has earned him the hatred of every blue uniform in the city, as well as the regard of LA's black population. When Elias's body is found with several 9mm slugs in it -- the caliber of the favorite police sidearm -- the city is poised is erupt again in riots. It's only been a few years since Rodney King and no one trusts the cops to tell the truth any longer, or not to tamper with evidence. Detective Harry Bosch can be a lose cannon but he's also probably the best homicide investigator the department has, so he draws the case -- with instructions to get it wrapped up as fast as possible. But it's not going to be an ordinary case; it never is when Harry's team is involved. Not to mention that his year-old marriage shows signs of crumbling.<br /><br />But it's difficult to tell just where Connelly is going with the social issues in this book, what his own take on the legal side of things is. Let's look at what's going on here: The first detectives on the scene -- members of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division, no less -- discover who the victim is and realize that the killer is probably another cop, . . . so they tamper with the crime scene and steal evidence, in an attempt to help the killer get away with it. Harry himself, who has nailed his share of dishonest cops, covers up for the RHD guys, though he worries that this makes him a co-conspirator. He also breaks into the victim's apartment without bothering to wait for a search warrant. He orders his partner to do the same thing with the victim's car. (They'll file for a warrant after the fact, if they find anything worth having.) Even the civilian Inspector General, who had an intimate relationship with the victim, is guilty of malfeasance when she gets involved in the case instead of recusing herself. And then she, too, steals key evidence -- and when Harry finds out, instead of nailing her to the wall, he simply uses his knowledge to cut a deal with her. None of these people seem to have any problem with ignoring the Constitution and the rule of law, not even Harry Bosch. Yes, this is a novel, but Connelly works from a life model and there are plenty of stories on the news to back him up as to the situation that prevails, not only in Los Angeles but everywhere in the country. Is it any wonder people don't trust the police? Neither do I.<br /><br />Having said all that, . . . it's a pretty good story. The characterizations, as always, are multidimensional and in full color, the dialogue flows naturally, and the plot's twists and turns, which involve a re-investigation of the original pedophile-related murder case behind Elias's lawsuit, are un-telegraphed and feel natural. Harry makes mistakes in judgment (besides those noted above), and people die who shouldn't have, and things get politically covered up that ought not to have been, but still -- he does his best. Can't ask more than that, I guess.-- and when Harry finds out, instead of nailing her to the wall, he simply uses his knowledge to cut a deal with her.

B002W1UEW4|1.0|Anyone who thought this was a good movie, seriously do not understand G.I. Joe., the story, the characters, or how much it meant to those who grew up on the comic books, the television cartoons, and the wonderful toys.  They probably don't even understand what makes a good movie.  Period.    That's okay.  They could have called this movie \\"G.I Joe - Revenge of the Mummified Huck Finn\\" and it would have made no difference.    I don't have a problem with the cast.  They are fine looking actors and actresses.  Can they act?  No, not really, but we are talking about comic book heroes and villains, not Oscar winning historical dramas.  Goofy plot?  Yes, but no more goofy or formulated than the typical television cartoon series plots.    I was truly hoping for a movie to explore the origins of Cobra, the G.I. Joe characters like Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Destro, Cobra Comander, etc.  Big, climatic battles, explosions, high-tech weapons and equipment are bonuses, not the major features of a movie.  Good story telling makes a good movie.    Instead, they cobbled together a weak plot and needlessly recreated character origins, their MOS, and tried to make up for it with CG graphics, special effects, big explosions, and the occasional nod towards the cartoon series and toys.    Problems I had with the changes in the movie include:    1. Duke was never engaged to the Baroness.  The cartoon series did hint at a remote attraction, but never followed up on it. She was also German.    2. Duke's friend / the Baroness' brother is NOT Cobra Commander    3. Snake Eyes was NOT some Japanese orphan.  He is a white American.    4. Snake Eyes did not take an oath of silence.  His vocal cords were damaged in a helicopter crash, in which he rescued Scarlett from.    5. Storm Shadow does not hate Snake Eyes for stealing food.    6. Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes were best friends.    7. Storm Shadow did not kill the \\"Hard Master\\".    8. Scarlett was never interested in Ripcord.  In the comic book,it was Snake Eyes.  In the television series, it was Duke.    9. Scarlett was a capable, independent, and somewhat aloof character, not some remake of Rachel Weisz's librarian character from \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"The Mummy II\\".    10. The Cobra Commander was not some mad scientist.    11. G.I. Joe was an AMERICAN, military, anti-terrorist, organization from multiple services, not a multi-national organization based in Egypt.    12. How can they call the movie \\"The Rise of Cobra\\", when their underwater base is destroyed, and all the major leaders are captured and put in prison?    13. They needlessly killed off Covergirl.    14. The Baroness was never a ninja student of Storm Shadow.    Other things like acceleration suits, slow firing energy weapons, funky green spooge that dissolves everything, impossible flight physics, Ripcord being African-American and a pilot, Breaker being French Algerian, can be written off as petty, but I was unwilling to cut this movie any slack after seeing all the other changes that were made.    I was wowed by the CG effects.  I was amazed by the action.  I memorized by the sexiness of Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) and the Baroness (Sienna Miller).  I was extremely disappointed by the movie's plot, script, and the revisions done to the original concepts.  Was it entertaining?  No... not really.  By the time the movie finally ended, I couldn't even feel nostalgic about G.I. Joe.    It was an exercise in bad movie making.  Cartoon comic books typically do not have deep plots, the occasional exception being \\"Watchmen\\" or even \\"X-Men\\" to a lesser degree.  For a movie to pull it off, it would need to focus on a character driven plot and character development.  \\"G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra\\" tries to do this, and fails miserably by trying to cover too many characters' pasts, origins, and tie them together, which required them to complete rewrite what was previously established in G.I. Joe lore.
B001SH290S|5.0|I really like this album, especially now that it has been remastered properly. The RVG edition sounded compressed, loud, harsh and unclear, it's well worth the extra money to get this Analogue Productions remastered version.  This is the first CD I bought of the series (there are so far 25 albums that have been remastered by Analogue Productions if I remember correctly), and after listening to it I immediately went online and also got Capuchin Swing, Lee Way, Dexter Calling and Moanin'.    These CDs sound fantastic!
B002UNMW7O|1.0|Guilty admission: I thought Boondock Saints was so badly directed, produced, written and shot that my mouth hung open in shock watching it but I enjoyed laughing at it. It was apparently made for 12-year-old boys by 10-year-old boys (dumb ones, no less). Why some folks think it is a \\"classic\\" is beyond me unless they mean it is a classic of rotten movie-making. In that case I wholeheartedly agreed. It is amateurish except for a few minutes of fair acting. I see no reason why this trashy sequel was made. However, at least they were consistent with the quality of the first. I can say that the first Boondock Saints was fun for me in a perverse way. I like bad movies. However, the sequel to a bad movie that is as pathetic as its original is pointless.: There is no surprise or delight left. It is just the same junk continued for no reason. Perhaps the director thought he was redeeming himself for the first movie. Maybe he believed he had actually improved or learned something or had new ideas? Nope. It is just like watching terrible movie twice. I don't get it. Then, again, I am not a 10-year-old boy who is impressed by blood, cursing or \\"cool\\" stuff like that. I think it was just made to squeeze another nickel from those poor souls who think the first \\"movie\\" was art.  Note: I was curious and looked up both these clunkers on [...] who puts the sequel in his \\"Your Movie Sucks\\" file...LOL...and [...] where only 20% of the hundreds of critics who reviewed these movies said they sorta of liked either movie. Most of these 20% critics are unknown or write for obscure sites. 80% of the other critics disliked the movies or downright hated them. Check it out.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I did not see Avatar in the theaters and waited for the Blu-ray release; this is my usual pattern. Having been a science fiction fan for over 70 years I was curious to see what this movie would bring to the genre. Frequently movies that are hyped to the extent this one has been hyped can be, to some degree, disappointing when viewed. This one was consistent in that regard but to a lesser degree than I had feared.<br /><br />Having never seen it in 3-D I can, nevertheless, see how it was produced to serve the features that 3-D offers; many scenes present objects that move toward the viewer in a manner designed to provoke a reaction from the 3-D viewer. This does not, in my opinion, interfere with the enjoyment of the movie in 2-D.<br /><br />My overall reaction to the movie is favorable in many regards. First is the interesting idea of the avatar; this idea has surfaced in sci-fi, but not often in my experience. The second is the idea of the sentient planet which has been used much more often; this version minimizes the proactive nature of that sentience by comparison with other sci-fi stories. Thirdly the picture quality and audio quality are both outstanding as are the much touted special visual effects.<br /><br />If I were to identify some flaws I would have to mention the rather prosaic, stereotypical characters that occupy certain supporting roles in the movie. The short-sighted, narrowly focused corporate manager character has been done far too often; Sigourney Weaver's character in Alien had a corporate antagonist cut out of exactly the same cloth. The tough, driven, mercenary commander's character has also been used to the point of annoyance; they were some of the evil straw men set up for the audience to hate.<br /><br />The tough mercenary soldiers were similarly designed to generate audience revulsion. Devices such as these are manipulative and I would have hoped this movie would rise above such simplistic alternatives. I would say that such choices as were made in this regard can be understood and overlooked if one can accept the basic premises of the movie in general. Some of the battle scenes were reminiscent of \\"Star Wars\\" but were suitably bombastic. It may be a propaganda piece as some have pointed out but that is fairly easy to overlook.<br /><br />I have watched the movie twice now and actually enjoyed it more the second time. A lot is happening fast and I would say it will take two viewings at least to begin to absorb all that is being displayed on the screen. The scenery is fascinating in its detail and provides the viewer with many interesting backgrounds; it is evident that a huge amount of work went into creating the movie and the planet Pandora.<br /><br />It appears that many who bought the disc have had problems viewing the movie. Blu-ray is a technological marvel but it does require some tender, loving care; most importantly Blu-ray machines can, and should be updated with the latest software. In this regard Blu-ray players are more like computers than the DVD players of the past. I have two OPPO players which are both capable of playing the disc; they are both connected by an Ethernet connection to the web and inform me automatically when an update is available.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest that all of those who are having problems avail themselves of any updates that might be available from the manufacturers of their equipment. Updates can usually be made from a network connection, through a USB input, or from a disc. For those who are disinterested in technology it may be wise to have a knowledgeable friend help with setup or hire someone to do the necessary setup; this is a problem that won't go away if ignored. If, on the other hand, the manufacturer is not providing the needed updates, or the player is obsolete and cannot update, then that is another problem entirely. If you find yourself deciding to get a new Blu-ray player, may I suggest the OPPO BDP-83; I am looking at one as I typethis and can recommend it highly. It is available from Amazon and will play Avatar.<br /><br />By way of summary, this is a disc worth having; some have complained it does not have extras and that is true but for $19.99 one can enjoy the movie now at home and then, should one desire, treat one's self to a Christmas present when the \\"Ultimate\\" edition comes out.om Amazon and will play Avatar.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|I remember the mega-hype when THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT came out. I watched it expecting to be terrified, but wound up groaning and rolling my eyes a lot instead. Well, fast forward to this evening, and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. I had heard all of the hype and watched as the horror websites tried to get their members to run to theatres in order to turn PA into the latest phenomenon. This time however, I wasn't as stupid or blind as I was w/ BLAIR WITCH. I'd learned a painful lesson. I refused to believe the BS! Now, without all of the marketing garbage, ACTIVITY is what I expected it to be. It's an extremely low-budget film w/ tons of mundane dialogue, a few creepy moments, and a big finale. That's it. I liked it ok, but I'm in no hurry to see it again. One thing I will say about that ending though. It's a hell of a lot better than the idiocy at the end of TBWP! I also watched the alternate ending to PA, and definitely prefer the theatrical one. So, don't be manipulated by the hyperbolic mania of the mass media! Otherwise, you may be sorry...
B00012QM8G|2.0|this movie is in my opinion extreme hate propaganda against germany and its people even the hero schindler is shown in this movie as a bad-corrupt guy-in over 180 minutes I cannot find just one second where the jew isn't shown as the victim with sad dog eyes and the german like an evil monster without any human feelings-this is pure hollywood but far far away from reality.  technical good made but not realistic at all.
B0035J6TA8|2.0|Let's face it: an entire covers album is a hard-sell for any artist. For Peter Gabriel, with little original music since 2002's 'Up', \\"Scratch My Back\\" is a disappointment, and I say this as a long-time Gabriel / Genesis fan. Yes, it is the case I've never seen a covers album done almost exclusively with a string section / small orchestra before, and some of the string arrangements are clever in their recording and production, but this does not mean that 'Scratch' is necessarily either innovative or creative, because it is neither.      Instead, the biggest achievement of 'Scratch My Back' is it's almost guarantee of being an effective sleep aid, no matter how awake you were prior to initially listening to it. Gabriel's covers, including those of David Bowie, Bon Iver, Paul Simon and Radiohead are uninspiring. Gabriel slows down the tempos on almost all of the pieces, ostensibly to give them more meaning and gravitas, but this does not work. Instead, the vocalizations are droll and non-emotive.     Let's also be frank, especially amongst the hard-core fans: Gabriel's voice is not at all what it used to be. Although the years have added an earthy timbre and patina to vocalizations, he has lost his high-end and sustain. This was evident on the 'Growing Up' tour from 2003 in support of the 'Up' album. I think the reason 'Scratch' was recorded the way it was; with generally soft orchestration, slower tempos and faint vocal delivery, is because at this point in his career as a musician Peter is not really able to do much else with his voice. This is not meant as an insult. The reality is that most vocalists, with a lifetime of recording and live performance behind them, are the worse-off for it, no matter how well an artist took care of their voice (see Phil Collins as another good example of this; during the '07 Genesis tour, many of the songs had to be performed in a lower key, and hence did not sound 'right', simply because, and by Phil's own admission, he was not able to hit the high notes and sustain them anymore).     Part of the reason for the mediocrity of 'Scratch', I suspect, is due less to Peter's real desire to record an album of covers of other artist's work than to have his own voice and compositions get exposure to a new generation of music fans who may not have ever even heard of Mr. Gabriel or his own original output (cynically, this could imply more music sold to a new audience and, as such, more royalties). Since 'Up' and the subsequent tour was a commercial letdown, I think 'Scratch' may have been some record exec's (or even Peter's own) brainchild. There is talk of a follow-up collection, 'Scratch Yours'; an album of Peter Gabriel covers by the artists Peter covered on 'Scratch', but I am not gonna hold my breath on that one for now.        In addition, I really don't want to hear from the hard-core Gabriel crowd an unyielding defense of 'Scratch' as being 'daring', or 'innovative' or 'progressive', as some of the other reviews on Amazon have stated; 'Scratch' is none of those things. The album will sell copies because long-time fans will buy it because they will buy anything that Peter puts out. As a listener to Gabriel's non-solo output over the years, including 'OVO', 'Passion', 'Long Walk Home', 'Birdy' and especially the more recent 'Big Blue Ball', I am very willing to bend my ear to follow Mr. Gabriel's departures into world music and soundtracks, almost always with a sense of gratitude that I did, as Peter's musical muse virtually guarantees new roads to travel for listeners of his many divergent paths. But with 'Scratch My Back', this time Mr. Gabriel has hit a dead-end.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt wrote a telling memoir of struggle, fear, rejection and salvation for a young Irish boy in the 1930's and 40's in Limerick, Ireland. The author was able to narrate from a child's point of view life as he knew it, and it added to the depth and emotion of the story. I am looking forward to reading his sequel 'Tis: A Memoir.
B0031OCY2E|5.0|I can't believe the critics largely panned this film, as I found it extraordinarily entertaining, with subtleties of humor (aka \\"The Office\\") that had me laughing out loud.  It also has an intriguing story-line that will keep you riveted to the couch.  What a pleasant surprise it was to stumble upon this overlooked treasure.
B001HN69B8|5.0|It seems that every time Gilliam releases a film that half the audience love it and half hate it.  Just because you loved his last one doesn't guarentee you'll love his next.   I do think one has to let the film live in them a bit before they rush to condem something as complex and unconventional as Dr. Parnassas.  Personally, I loved this movie.  It swept me away into places I've only gone in my dreams.  It kept me guessing and asking questions.  It resonated with me days and even weeks after.  To honestly critique this movie one has to fully recognize what Gilliam had to do to keep this project alive.  He found a way to salvage a labor of love (and not just his work but Heath Ledger's too - because once can see clearly from watching this movie that Heath relished playing his twisted character in same manner as he did the joker.  Some people say that Dark Knight should have been his last film.  I personally liked this film more and I think this is further proof of Ledger's talent having fully blossemed in his later years.  Bravo to Heath and Terry.  They really made a great team!    One other thing I loved about this movie, is that when the other actors (Depp, Law, Ferrell) come into the film to take over for Ledger, they do so with the upmost respect to the performance and specific character work that Ledger had already provided.  And though I don't care for Law or Farrell as actors (celebrities), it should be mentioned that they were perfectly cast in this film as two somewhat unlikable characters - so for me it all worked out fine.  I have some questions in regards to the symbolism and plot...but hey, I give the benefit of the doubt to Gilliam, since, after all, hasn't he earned it?  He's one of the last true American auteur filmmakers we have!
B000006045|4.0|I was a huge fan of Massive Attack in college and for whatever reason they kinda fell off my radar. But then I found Mezzanine as I was unpacking a couple of weeks ago and popped it in the CD player for old times sake. Whoa! I was blown away by how much these songs still resonate with me.    \\"Man Next Door\\" gets in my head but \\"Teardrop\\" will always be number one. In fact, a came across a pretty great cover by another band called Civil Twilight (you can watch it here, seriously I hate covers too and this blew me away - [...])    An amazing album that you will love forever!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I loved this version of Emma.  Many reviewers have given reasons why this is such a charming adaptation and I can't really improve on their well thought out and erudite comments.  But I would like to comment on my favorite scene.  It is the scene where Mr. Knightly reveals to Emma his love for her.  His subtle facial expression mixing adoration and self-doubt are absolutely wonderful.  Believe me, this version is well-worth watching just for that scene.    On an additional note.  Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned that the BBC version is different from the PBS version.  I was not sure that I wanted to purchase the dvd, but now I am anxious to see the deleted scenes.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|I was anxiously anticipating the release of this movie,the 1st black princess movie was so late coming,I was very excited,but this was just terrible!!!!what a waste of time and energy.I cant even get into all that I didnt like about this movie.it was sooo boring and the prince was a toad in frog form and as a man!!all the stereotyping of african-americans was very disturbing for me.I really expected alot more imagination and wonderment from Disney then this.All the hype,and this is the best you can do?
B0019N8P2W|5.0|FIRST: It's about time!!! And how wonderful to see this release done RIGHT, with plenty of extras, such as the \\"Daria Day\\" intros that were created for marathon viewings. One might wish for lengthier interview content, but really -- this is a terrific package that, frankly, exceeds expectations, so it's very hard to complain! Yes, it would be great to have the original music ... but that just wasn't realistically possible. Fortunately, the show is easily strong enough to survive. The characters are still rich and vibrant, and the stories still witty, hilarious and emotionally complex. Bravo to everyone involved!    SECOND: A word for new fans about the chronology of this set. The movie \\"Is It Fall Yet?\\" has been placed on the last disc. This film should actually be watched BETWEEN SEASONS FOUR AND FIVE. That's where it fits, filling in the summer break between school years. The second movie, \\"Is It College Yet?\\" should be watched following the end of Season Five, as it dovetails with the final episode and wraps up everything.
B001NXDSLG|2.0|The blueray audio/video is not noticibly better than DVD. I seem to have paid extra for a lot of very silly memorabilia, such as a reproduction of the show ticket and a case that looks like one of those suede leather jackets that were popular in the late 60's early 70's  My guess is that they put their investment in this silly memorabilia rather than a digital remastering of the movie that would have taken advantage of the blueray format.  This is not a good value. Look for this movie in a simple, less expensive product packaging.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I love this movie.  I would say it's quite possibly the best disney movie I've ever seen other than Mulan.  If you've never seen this, I highly recommend it.  Action, Adventure, Family, Friends, Faith. Teasure Planet has it all!  I saw it the year it came out, and even now (I'm 19), I still love this movie.  I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't fallen in love with it back then, that I would still love to watch it today.  There are so many great lessons that everyone can relate to in it.  So if you have never heard of it, rent if from the library, grab your family, kids, and friends, and sit down to watch it! I recommend a cup of tea while you watch.  Plus, who can beat getting the DVD, lightly used, for THREE DOLLARS off Amazon. !! :)
0470477237|5.0|Good Afternoon, Social Rabbit here with your guide to the world of social media.    Today I am starting a new post slot called Mental Monday's, the idea being that each week I will review a book/whitepaper related to social media.  My reasons for this are that I want to read more and just am not holding myself accountable, so I thought my readers could hold me accountable instead.  I welcome suggestions on which books you would like reviewed.  I would like to point out that I don't get given the books to review, nor do I own a book store & I will always say what I think!    Today's book is Socialnomics: How Social Media Transforms the Way We Live and Do Business by Erik Qualman.  You might recognise this name, he is the guy who bought us the YouTube video called the Social Media Revolution - a must watch for everyone if you haven't seen it.    So back to the book, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is a very easy read with lots of case studies to bring it to life, it is very open and honest, and tells it exactly how it is.  It contains eight chapters on different social media topic such as word of mouth, social media = preventative behaviour, Obama's success with social media, winners & losers in 140 character world and more.  At the end of each chapter Erik has a 1 page list of key point that you can take away.  Below I have listed my favourite key points (please note that these are all direct quotes):        * Spending time on social media makes you more productive.  Social media is the mechanism that allows users to avoid \\"information indigestion\\".      * Business models need to shift.  Simply digitizing old business models doesn't work; businesses need to fully transform to properly address the impact and demands of social media      * Not all great marketing ideas need to originate in the marketing department.      * What happens in Vegas stays on YouTube.      * Social media enables frustrated customers to instantly post their unbridled frustrations      * Effectivecompanies and people relish critical feedback via social media.      * Social media allows individuals to take real-time inventories of their lives and helps answer the age old question \\"what am I doing with my life?\\"      * Reality TV has been replaced by reality social media      * Consumers want to take ownership of your brand and brag about your product; let them!      * Socialommerce is a referral program on steroids [refering to social media ecommerce]      * The old adage that you can only have two of these - cheap, quick or quality - doesn't hold true within social media.  It is possible to have all three      * Consumers are looking to peers for recommendations on products, services, health issues, and more via social media.  Only companies that produce great products and services will be part of these conversations; mediocrity will quickly be eliminated.      * The transparency and speed of information exchanged within social media mitigates casual schizophrenic behaviour.  Having a \\"work\\" personality and having a \\"party\\" personality will soon become extinct.  People and companies will need to have one essence and be true to that essence.      * No person or company is perfect, so you are best to admit your faults and the public will respect you for it.      * It's better to live a social media life making mistake than living a social media life doing nothing.      * Don't build your \\"Field of Nightmares\\" [refering to the Field of Dreams quote build it and they will come] by building or replicating a social network for your company.  If you build it they will most likely not come.  You are better connecting to the best in class social media tools that exist.  You aren't a social media company so don't attempt to parade as one.      * The younger generation's interpersonal communication skills are starting to suffer as a result of overdependence on nonverbal and non-face-to-face interactions    Just from these snippets of information you can see that he talks about where social media is and where he thinks it is going.  This book made me think about what I am doing, and how I can do it better, the case studies are great for new ideas and can be applied to any business.    I would recommend this book, not only for newbies to social media but also those who have been around the tracks a few times, it will make you think about what you are doing and how you are doing it.    Was this useful?  Tell me yes or no in the comments, do you want me to keep doing reviews?    [...]
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I just love this movie!  Very timely turnaround time.  Would buy again from this seller.
B002ZG97RY|4.0|This movie is very entertaining especially if you understand a little about the Iraq War and/or have been to the middle east (not Dubai). The characters in the film are based on people in real life and if you know who those characters are you will really appreciate the intensity and depth of this film's plot. There are some great high temp scenes of frantic action much like the Bourne Identity which I thoroughly enjoyed.    Matt Damon's acting and Greg Kinnear's acting are excellent and this is why a lot of people pay to see the film. The ending is good and seeing those two actors on the screen is very climatic. The middle portion of the movie does slow down and get boring but the beginning and end are action packed.     The Iraqi perspective is shown and is great tie in. The soundtrack to this film is also very good. Don't miss it.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|I like the types of movies you have to bend your head around. This is just such a movie and I can barely say enough good about it. The plot involves a time loop which the main character is stuck in yet also witnesses as a 3rd party. As the same events unfold a couple of times she figures out (or thinks she figures out) how to break the loop and get her normal life back.     As others have pointed out, this is rather like the movie Timecrimes, but I found this infinitely better. In Timecrimes, the main character is involved and can break the loop easily but doesn't. Here, the main character wants to break the loop but cannot.    These types of movies seem impossible to me to write, but this script makes it look almost easy. All the scenes are revisited (often more than once) and each revisiting helps pull the entire thing tighter and make it all the more understandable. And scenes you thought were \\"throwaway\\" or merely exposition all come back to have an integral part in the plot. These types of movies can be a chore to follow because the plot is always bending back on itself, but again, here I never once found myself scratching my head trying to figure things out. Everything happened in a way where the plot unfolded like a flower.    Melissa George was the only actor recognizable to me and she does a very good job. The rest of the cast does a decent enough job, but no one stuck out as being particularly bad or good.       The ending is also way cool. It's like a dream within a dream, or in this case, a loop within a loop. The viewer is lulled into a sense of ending only to be be treated to a rather disturbing reality.  This is just a really cool flick with adroit direction, good sound, editing and music score. If you're looking for something way off center, give this a shot. It's well worth your time investment.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This DVD articulates everything about Pink Floyd; I love it! I'm sure others who do not have this item would love it as much as I do.
0307450570|5.0|Martha Stewart in all her crafty glory. She's genius. TONS of amazing ideas in this book. It's inspiring!! Well worth the price!
B003A9OVS0|1.0|I was a big fan of both Gorillaz and Demon Days, so even though Stylo wasn't a great song, I bought the album as soon as it was released anyway.  Big mistake.  Besides the aforementioned Stylo, the only other song that is DECENT is Glitter Freeze, which is an instrumental.  The rest sounds like filler, or B-sides from a bunch of singles.  Terrible vocals(sung and rapped,) terribly constructed music and beat-wise.  Just a terrible album.  Maybe the worst I've bought in 5 years or more.
0785134352|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this graphic novel. The art was unique as the story was too. I never imagined that I'd be reading about what would happen if I actually tried to be a super hero, and this book does that in a fun, exciting, and funny way. Overtime you feel like you know the characters because you can relate to them, in a way. I'm not saying that you're a masked vigilante out fighting against mobsters, but I mean the sense that when they dont have they're masks on they are really just regular people, teenagers in this case. And for those who said there was too much profanity in this graphic novel, speaking for all 15 year olds who go to public school, we hear this kind of language all the time so its nothing new. There is a horrific amount of violence and blood in this book too! There were some images of people getting killed in this book that made my jaw drop, one particular scene in book four actually had me envision what it would like like if it was in motion, thats why it made my jaw drop. The characters in this book are really cool, the only one who I thought was annoying was Kick-Ass believe it or not. He just acted so insecure and cried during the whole book which I thought kind of made his name a lie. The ending was the biggest flaw with this book though, it was the kind of ending where you say \\"What the hell\\". Also, some of the plot twists in this book are just too predictable, they should have done a better job at hiding them. But it set itself up for a sequel, which let me forgive the ending of the book and gave me hope that maybe the second one would recognize some of the flaws of the main character and ending and fix them. Overall, its a fun read! Nothing spectacular but the artwork is great and its definitely a new way to read a comic book.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|The year is 1962, and sixteen-year old Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is a  cello-playing student who hopes to attend to Oxford.  A chance meeting with a charming man twice her age quickly develops into a romance, opening up an exciting, glamorous world to the young girl.<br /><br />This is a coming-of-age story with a wonderful script and a stellar cast.  Young Carey Mulligan is pretty, funny, sensitive, and gutsy and has loads of charisma.  She didn't look quite young enough but was still delightful.  Peter Sarsaard plays the older man who sweeps her (and her family) of her feet.  He's absolutely convincing as the worldly lecher who pursues Jenny.  He gave me the creeps and I couldn't understand why her family welcomed him with such open arms.  It was nice to see Emma Thompson in a small but meaty role as Jenny's headmistress.<br /><br />Although it has disturbing moments, I enjoyed the movie very much and I think Miss Mulligan is destined for many great film roles in the future.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|One of the best shows ever produced on TV is now on DVD. The second season is even better then the first.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I love the E5. It connects via USB to be recharged. Im yet to put battery life to the test. But I listen to 1-2 hours of music a day and ir shows no sign of death. The first time I plugged it in I jumped at how loud my lower smart phones volume output had became via headphones. Its got a switch to altenate between hi shelf sound and bass boost, a volume button, and a belt clip, and a power button with a blue led light power indicator. One can barely tell from the pictures. But this thing is small. About 1 n a half by 1 n a half inches. I love it I take it everywhere. Im a frequent walker.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|Like most people here, you'd probably think this item will greatly enhance your gaming experience with it's personalized surround sound feature, and while the X41 does do it's job on that part, it's other flaws overshadow it's better points.<br /><br />Connection is fickle - no matter how close you are to the receiver or how clear a space you have between it, it WILL frequently project a loud clicking noise that is ear damaging.<br /><br />No noise isolation - why is this important? Because with no noise isolation, you'll have to turn the volume way up to block the outside noises and when you do turn it way up, your ears get damaged, as mine did.<br /><br />No battery health indicator - the only way to know when your batteries are dead is when there's no sound coming from your headphones.<br /><br />The good thing about it is that wearing it is not uncomfortable and setup was easy.
030745455X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is back....and just as antisocial and strange as ever.  Estranged from ex-friend, lover and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she still finds herself partnering with him--albeit, from afar---to bring down a vicious group of criminals specializing in the trafficking of young girls.  When three murders are discovered within the city and tied back to Salander, she goes underground.  While Blomkvist immerses himself in proving Lisbeth's innocence and finding the real killer of his friends, Lisbeth herself is less concerned with the media's portrayal of her as a murdering psychopath and much more focused on following the trail of blood to see where it leads.  Where it takes her is on a trip into her past....a painful past that brings her face-to-face with an age-old enemy whose very existence is impossible to prove....<br /><br />A huge improvement from its slower predecesser, The Girl Who Played With Fire is a thriller of the highest order.  A true pageturner that most readers will find impossible to put down.  Great book.<br /><br />DYB
B002NPUCP8|1.0|I was fooled. Attracted by the colaboration with Steve Vai, \\"Highly Strung\\", I went for this album with good expectations.<br /><br />What a fool.<br /><br />The album is simply lousy. It has some of the worts kind of pop ever recorded, in nothing different from dozens of similar female pop artistis. With one thing even worse: Orianthi's voice is awful, annoying.<br /><br />Rubbish, and another rubbish clever designed by producers.
B0016CP1QY|4.0|If you are searching for some truly unique music, you have arrived. Terry Collier's Occasional Rain is not the folk of Dylan, not the jazzy work of Fairport Convention. It is as contemplative as Nick Drake, but sounds nothing like that master. It is brim full of soul, but sounds not a wit like the early 1970s folk experiments of the Isley Brothers.<br /><br /> It has both all and none of those sounds<br /><br />Bot Occasional Rain is an album that could have only been made in the 70s. If a folkie tried it now, it would sound like sterile retro-tread.<br /><br />These jazz inflected tunes, the deep, meditative production, and most of all, Collier's  husky, soulful, almost prophet-command voice lifts this album into masterpiece territory. It is completely genuine--an amazing synergy of styles.<br /><br />I did not say mix or blend of styles, and in lies Occasional Rain's rub. It strikes me, hard, that I have not reached the goal I set for myself as a reviewer: to make you hear the music reading my text. This is a function of this album having a sound even a music junkie like me can't quite nail down, and that is almost always a good thing: with some of the best music, the usual descriptors just don't work<br /><br />Let this rain on you.
B000002HRE|5.0|Excellent service! Got my merchandise in absolutely no time. Great job guys! Would recommend to everyone.
B000069KGM|5.0|This shows the immense musical talent Chicago had from the start at a very young age, and along with Chicago 9, are the greatest 2 albumns/cd's they ever created....  This showcases everything from their jazz-blues-rock infused musical base and is so enjoyable playing anytime....    This is Chicago as they always were, and at their BEST, and not what they later became after Ceterra left in 80's & 90's as a sappy foo-foo power ballad group.
B000002MUM|5.0|I only wish whoever mastered this Vinyl album would go back and re-do the originals. I like the originals but listening to Wildflowers really points out how the old records were meant for air-play with bright, forward mid-range.<br />  the sonics on WF are just immacualte, beautiful. Everything from vocals to percusssion is just perfect. Best [...] bucks I ever spent on an album. Also the deepest music Tom Petty has ever written.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This soundtrack is a great mix of alternative artists. It is addicting and has been a great cd for me to play all day long.
0385504225|3.0|The most helpful reviews listed are pretty much dead on. And while I admit I liked this book to some degree, I had a very difficult time loving it, just because it was sooo slow. Having read Angels and Demons previously, I was expecting a more action packed book that kept you pretty much on edge for it's majority moving you from one location to the next. Even though it has it's amount of cliffhangers and mysteries-this was NOT the case with The Lost Symbol. The book is crammed with a lot of additional fluff that seems to serve no other purpose than to fill the pages.    It felt like the characters spent way too much time philosophizing and discussing religious/scientific/historical concepts than actually trying to solve their mystery. And it was also extremely disappointing that the characters were too quick to fall into painfully obvious traps (\\"Gee, my brother has never texted a message in his life- BUT he texted me right now to say he's ok.. and what? Invite this totally random stranger to our SECRET lab that nobody on Earth knows about but us?? Suuure, no problem!!\\"     Robert Langdon's character was difficult to like in this book with his constant disbelief at every turn (\\"But that's impossible! It's a myth!!), and the whole \\"oh, but the answer is simple- it's right in front of your face- but I won't just TELL you, I'm going to make you guess really hard!\\" attitude of the characters in the book (everyone's got so much EXPLAINING to do, do we really HAVE to be so mysterious in our approach? If you know the answer- just SAY THE ANSWER!!!)    It was definitely a page-turner, but mostly I was waiting for the pace to pick up (and it did for awhile, only to go back down again), and when I realized that it is wasn't going to get much better- I just wanted to finish reading the book already (enough is enough!!).    Regardless, I did enjoy the idea of the story. I did not enjoy how dragged out it was to actually TELL that story. The ending was definitely a letdown in that it wasn't nearly as exciting as I hoped for it to be, MOSTLY because the last 20-30 or so pages seemed to be completely unnecessary. It felt like the author got caught up telling one story, but forgot that he had a whole other mystery at hand to solve. So after the one 'BIG' unveiling, there's nothing left and you get stuck with one character explaining things to the other in a \\"oh, by the way, I owe you the answers now since you went through all THIS, so here it is\\".. and you're like \\"Oh?? oh.. ok that makes sense.. whatever. Thanks for wasting my time Dan Brown\\".
B003BVK36Q|4.0|John Le Carre is one of our most fluent and literate writers, writing with simple elegance and poignant wisdom.  He earned world-wide fame with \\"The Spy Who Came Out of the Cold,\\" perhaps his finest work, and he pushed himself to his suspenseful best with \\"The Little Drummer Girl.\\"  His British spy novels prove he is our most perceptive chronicler of the Cold War, and like many \\"Cold War Warriors\\" he suddenly found himself with a profession but without a cause after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  He whole-heartedly used his awesome fame and immense literary talent to tackle the splintered, chaotic, and frightening amoral world that emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and while that's praise-worthy what is not is his half-hearted attempts to try to forge a new sense, orderliness, and morality with his new writing.  This was most obvious in \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" a tirade against the global pharmaceutical industry masquerading as a detective novel.  His most recent novel \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" re-writes \\"The Constant Gardener\\" but without the outrageous self-righteousness, and it is the better of his post-Cold War novels.      In \\"The Constant Gardener\\" the heroes (a diplomat's crusading wife and her doctor ally) die before the start of the novel, and the would-be heroes (two young detectives) are relegated to bureaucratic nothingness right away, leaving the most reluctant hero.  In \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" this constellation of characters is re-born but the import of their roles has been re-configured.  A young crusading lawyer now takes center-stage alongside her naive Chechen client.  Two German detectives are their accomplices in trying to, if not make the world a better place, at least try to make sense of it.  The reluctant hero, international financier Tommy Brue, is more in the background, where his conscience languishes and anguishes.  The natural villains of the book (a Russian warlord and his British financier) are long dead, and it is the Americans who take their role.  The plot of the book is obvious from the start, and the ending always assured.  But Le Carre is such a fluent writer and he presents such sympathetic characters that we do follow the much too long book until the very end.     \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" may be Le Carre's last book, and if that is the case it is not a bad way to end a brilliant and startling career.
0802136834|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book about Henry VIII's wives. The way it is written is very easy to sink into and sometimes reads like a novel rather than a history book. I love the detail. There are SOME parts that drag on a little bit with too many names, dates and places (however you must keep in mind that this IS history, and not a novel!!), but for the most part it's an excellent account of their lives.     I had gotten an interest lately about them due to all the other books I have read (Philippa Gregory, Allison Weir), as well as TV shows, movies, and this was just an easy way to learn about all of the queens. Awfully convenient!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|The notions I had about this Score before listening to it were that it would be the same Zimmer-esque affair which has grown to be his unique signature upon the movies to which he's contributed, boy was I mistaken...    It seems that, with this project at least, Mr. Zimmer has taken a break from being, well, Mr. Zimmer. Gone are the typically heavy motiffs which comprise most if not all of the projects for film which he has labored upon in the last few years. Instead we are presented with a very light-hearted main theme that captures the silly, smart, eccentric, and overtly rational perosna that is Robert Downey Junior's masterful portrayal of Sherlock Holmes as the album opens with a bang. \\"Discombobulate\\", as it is named, employs the standard large section of strings and some pleasant suprises in the form of a saloon piano, a banjo, and a glockenspiel; this alone sets the tone for a fun romp through the world of Sherlock Holmes.    Other highlights (my favorites) include: Track 4 \\"My Mind Rebels at Stagnation\\", Track 7 \\"Marital Sabotage\\", Track 10 \\"Panic, Shear Bloody Panic\\", and Track 13 \\"Catatonictes\\".    Very enjoyable! Comes highly recommended!    Demonstrates that Mr. Zimmer can branch-out and give us something fun, witty, insightful, smart, and all the while be easy to listen to.

So, I expected a thought-provoking, well-researched narrative on the scary - and I would say downright deplorable - conditions in which our nation's food is grown, and that's exactly what Pollan provides to readers. To boil it down, the resounding message to me is 'ignorance is bliss.' Golly, I was already a student of nutrition - and a longtime vegetarian to boot - before reading this book, but now, I think I'm going to have to add gardener to the mix!

0375757295|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece.powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets.

B002OB9KPE|3.0|I write very few reviews here, not that I don't have anything to say about the music I love, but largely because usually, somebody else has already said what I have to say.<br /><br />With a few exceptions, this is not the case here!<br /><br />Why didn't someone tell me this was a blatant, hard-core Christian, religious song?  Why do so few reviewers bring up the subject?  Is it a conspiracy to get us to listen to their schlock, as religious fanatics are usually the ones who will do anything to try to get you to listen to their plea to worship their Lord, or else we're all gonna die?<br /><br />That pretty much sums up the theme of the main epic.<br /><br />I am a DEVOTED lover of all things prog-rock, going back to Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Emerson, Lake & Palmer - yes, I'm that old.  And I simply worship the music of The Flower Kings, IQ, Kaipa, Riverside, Porcupine Tree, The Tangent, etc. etc., so I am no stranger to the \\"new\\" prog-rock scene.  It is amazing this music lives on, and gets better and better with age.  I also LOVED the past Transatlantic records, and just about anything Roine Stolt does!<br /><br />Yet it is the MESSAGE here that bothers me.  I don't mind spirituality - in fact, it is obvious much of The Flower Kings and previous Transatlantic records, especially Bridge Across Forever, speaks to the subject of our spiritual being.  But usually it is presented as more of a life-style, a way to be, a kinder, gentler way of living to be in sync with nature and the planet (i.e. \\"There Is More To This World\\").  Or it makes us think, \\"What If\\" (i.e. \\"Bridge Across Forever\\" - \\"...my love, she is standing by the side, of a Magic River, that there is crossing.  Maybe someday when our spirits begin to rise, and light fills our eyes... We will meet again...\\")  It is hopeful and makes us feel good to believe there MAY be a \\"forever\\" where we will meet those we love who passed before us.  This is beautiful stuff (listening to it now)!  I'm an agnostic, so Ibelieve we have no idea what eternity holds for us!  Much of this music speaks to that yearning for the unknown.<br /><br />But this has devolved into the standard, Bible-thumping, \\"man, you better get on your knees and worship the Lord or else we are all GONNA DIE!!\\"  I dislike and disapprove of the Christian philosophy that the \\"giver of life\\", God, is such an arrogant jerk to require you to bend on knee and succumb to him, or else you will burn in eternal hell.  That sure has never sounded very nice to me, for somebody as all powerful and all forgiving as God!  And, unfortunately, that's the message here.<br /><br />Plus, don't be fooled by some reviewers here, EVERY song has SOME religious imagery, all leading to that idea that we are in trouble if we don't serve the Lord.<br /><br />Personally, I think the world is in trouble because too many different people have too many different ideas about what \\"serving the Lord\\" is!  It causes chaos, not calm.<br /><br />So, Neal, you're a great musician, but your religion has turned too much into the Holy Roller brand, and you've lost me.  And please, Neal, please quit being like the conservative religious hypocrites Roine sometimes reflects on in HIS songs, by doing everything you can to FORCE me to listen your lectures!<br /><br />Whew, having said that, and now that I've turned off all the religious fans of this band, I must say the THREE stars are for musical excellence!  This IS great music!  Okay, even musically, I don't think quite as grand or flowing as the great \\"Duel With the Devil\\" from BAF.  It's odd for me to say this (as somebody who enjoys TFK's Garden of Dreams 60-minute opus), but this is too long!  Some parts drag.  I think this could have been cut about 20 minutes and been better.  All that \\"the giver of life is asking you to DANCE...\\" dance dance dance -the \\"dance\\" bit goes on a bit long - geez, Neal, if I wanted to listen to a dance record I would have put on some hip-hop!  I don't even like dancing!(\\"We Don't Dance\\"...:))<br /><br />Musical highlights here must include Portnoy's drumming!  Man, there are some mean drum licks in here!  And some wicked syncronized playing, drums, guitar, bass and keys!  But overall, it falls a bit flat for me.<br /><br />Why am I complaining?  I don't like that a) this was not released as an MP3 so I could hear it before plopping down the big bucks to get the CD, and b) there were NO samples to listen to.  I bought this on the strength of their previous albums, and I'm a bit disappointed.  Plus, I was not aware this was blatant, preachy Christian rock; see complaint about samples below.<br /><br />Is it terrible?  No.  But is it a leap forward from their past work?  No.  Anything you hear on this album, you've heard on the others.<br /><br />I just listened to it in my car one more time, blaring loud yesterday, and I'm convinced this won't earn a regular rotation on my list.  It's just not THAT good, as it should be.<br /><br />I would suggest, as alternatives, the VERY impressive album by Jonas Reingold's Karmakanic, \\"Who's the Boss In the Factory?\\", or the amazing IQ album \\"Frequency\\", or how about Unifaun's debut album!  \\"Who's the Boss...\\" is especially fantastic.  The closing song, \\"Eternally Part 2\\" may be one of the most dramatic prog songs ever recorded!  It's simply beautiful and yes, it DOES touch on the subject of the prospect of eternal life (\\"I fear eternity is near, I give myself to you, eternally\\").  It's less preachy, leaving your own interpretation of what IS eternity going to be?<br /><br />If you've read this far, maybe you're like I was: doubtful about the religious focus of this album.  I want to confirm: yes, this is VERY religous, and it interferes with the music, which itself just isn't as top notch as you would expect from these top notch players.
0141439807|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

1400052173|4.0|Don't be turned off by the scientific element of this book. Sure the first third contains facts about the cells from Henrietta Lacks that would change the medical world, but at it's heart it's really a story of a daughter looking for some connection to the Mother she never knew, and the impact of what happened to her Mothers cells, and how that impacted her extended family. It also shines a sometimes harsh light on the medical field and the lengths they've gone to throughout history in the pursuit of understanding what makes the body tick, and sometimes not tick.
031606792X|1.0|I have just read the reviews of Stehpenie Meyer's books and I have to say that the best writing has been accomplished by the readers, not the author.  Your comments were laugh-out-loud funny and I enjoyed them much more than the books themselves.  I agree that the editor should be shot, then hung, then burned at the stake.  Is the entire town of Forks really \\"pursing\\" their lips?  Did the editor even notice that Stephenie used the same silly phrases over and over and over and over?  I think she dashed off the final book while driving her kids to soccer practice, or maybe she texted it to the publisher while driving to the local Piggly Wiggly.  I really enjoyed the first three and was reeled in like everyone else, but the last debacle was a travesty.  When I read the name \\"Renesmee\\", I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't reconfiguring the letters on the page.  Could anyone really be that unimaginative?  With all the centuries worth of literature written on mythological creatures, she couldn't come up with a better name than that???  I'm sure ol' Steph is laughing all the way to the bank, but somewhere in the deep recesses of her mind, she should feel a bit ashamed for taking such ungrateful advantage of her readers. Stephenie Meyers definitely went for the juglar with this one.  I hope she reads all of these reviews before she finishes writing \\"Midnight Sun\\" or the sun may be setting on her writing career. She should have called it \\"Breaking Wind\\"!

B002VPE1B6|4.0|First, this is just the Blu Ray disk with no extra features. It was fine for me because I bought the DVD because I wasn't able to see the movie in the theaters and so wanted to at least see it on my wide screen TV at home.<br /><br />I have a decent, medium-price range Yamaha upscaling video and audio processor and the movie looked great at 1080p on my three year old Samsung LCD TV using a modestly priced Panasonic Blu Ray player. I know people who prefer plasma TVs because they say the color quality is somewhat better (I wouldn't know as I'm not an expert here), but for me it looked great as is.<br /><br />As for the movie, I really enjoyed the spectacular visuals and CGI effects, and it's the movie's real strength. The world of Pandora is just beautifully and fully realized, with fantastic ecology and sci-fi ideas that could have been pulled from at least a dozen sci-fi and fantasy authors that I can think of. Too bad Robert Heinlein didn't live long enough to see all these movies with people in mechanized armor which he wrote about in his book, Starship Troopers, back in 1959, now a half a century ago. And I think Anne McCaffrey (Dragon Riders of Pern, etc.) would like the dragons and how their relationship with the Na'vi are portrayed. James Schmitz pioneered writing ecologically oriented science fiction, and of course there's Frank Herbert's famous Dune novel and series. This movie has elements from all of those great writers.<br /><br />But as for the story line, it's fine, but there's nothing especially original here, and the movie is sort of like Pocahontas meets Duke Nukum. The humans are the bad guys trying to mine a highly valuable mineral, but they have to get rid of the natives first. Oddly enough, this was the same plot of another recent animated flick, the name escapes me unfortunately, but humans were trying to terraform their world and take it for themselves. This seems to be a popular plot idea these days.<br /><br />Some of the details of the ecology were original, such as the idea that the giant trees form a huge, planet-wide communications network, sort of like a neural network or gigantic brain. And that the natives could tap into the knowledge stored there. That was cool.<br /><br />I saw a TV show recently that showed how they used mini-cams to film the actors' faces so as to make the expressions more realistic. This process seemed to work out very well, too.<br /><br />In summary, it's a movie with great special effects, with lots of fun ideas pulled from a lot of the great science fiction and fantasy writers of the past to create a very cool planetary ecology, a sympathetic alien species who just want to be left alone in their little paradise, and greedy human bad guys who don't mind killing the natives if they can make a profit. Overall, a truly spectacular movie visually even if there wasn't anything especially original about the story. I give it a solid four stars since it's really a three star movie plot/idea with five star special effects.dea that the giant trees form a huge, planet-wide communications network, sort of like a neural network or gigantic brain.

030745455X|3.0|I think the popularity of this series of books relates to Lisabeth's one-sided \\"answer\\" to a universal ethical conundrum related to boundaries, namely, ought we respect the personal boundaries of other people if we suspect they may be up to no good?  Lisabeth uses her computer hacking skills to get inside of the minds and lives of virtually every other character in the novel, and she implicitly justifies her modus operandi by doing it all in the pursuit of social justice.  Each of us as individuals, as well as organizations up to the level of sovereign nations, routinely faces the same temptation as we frantically try to control the directions in which our worlds are headed.  If we suspect our kids are doing drugs, should we not snoop in their private diaries?  If we think their friends are bad influences, should we not install spying and monitoring equipment on their computers?  Lisabeth Salendar provides the answer at one end of the spectrum, but this novel fails to make any case at all for what it costs us in terms of trust to condone such wholesale boundary violations, both as individuals and as a society.
0380977788|3.0|This book is WEIRD, but for some that might be in a good way.  The images are vivid and the characters, original. _Coraline_ is certainly imaginative and well-written, but I can't decide if it's creepy or fun. If you are the type that likes to read a book and then have nightmares, you'd probably hold it's a 5 star book, and if you want something light and cheerful, then it's a 2.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I read this for the first time about 2 years ago. And when the books' free....  This book (and the books after it) were great. Lousia May Alcott made 4 girls, that seem real. 4 girls with problems that girls have now.  I especially loved the bond that the March family had. How happy they were when their father came home....  Wonderful book. 5 stars.
0061689246|4.0|Mr. Gaiman writes a beautiful and suspenseful fantasy, filled with interesting characters, in _Stardust_.  I also really liked the depiction of real love versus infatuation. However, I felt that the story needed more depth (the characters, while interesting, could have used even more development).  Also, there is one use of the f-word that is unnecessary and I think actually detracts from the book for 2 reasons. 1) I found it out of character of the majestic and aloof character that says it, and 2) it makes the book inappropriate for readers who otherwise would appreciate it. Overall, though, I really enjoyed _Stardust_.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Based on the true story of Michael Oher a now pro Football player.    Michael (Quinton Aaron)  is maybe 16 or 17 at the beginning of this movie, and he is from the `wrong' side of town.  Everyone can see he is huge, and he's great with a basketball.  He ends up getting into a private Christian school, and they want him to play football, but he needs to seriously raise his grades first.     Leigh Tougy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean Tougy (Tim McGraw) see `Big Mike' walking late at night when it's cold out, and figure out that he has no home, and invite him to stay with them for the night.  They end up becoming much more involved, and helping his teachers and his coach understand who Michael is.  Helping them learn how to teach him.     A movie about adoption, taking care of other peoples needs, and not caring about other peoples judgement.  A movie about beating the odds and getting out of unfavorable situations.  A movie about real family love (and Michael IS part of their family).     I liked the Blind Side, it was a good story that was well written. There was swearing in it, although not so much that I couldn't enjoy the movie (of course I would have prefered they skipped that all together and it still would have flowed well, but that's me).  No sex scenes or even hints of it.  Michael did at one point defend his \\"sister\\" and \\"mom\\" from offensive comments from his old friends.    The first 5 minutes confused me, and I kept waiting for more details about it, but I never did see more about it.  It was about a football accident involving other players, but I didn't see how it fit.   Because of this scene I was tense waiting for the `accident' and sure that his life was going to be ruined.     I was able to enjoy this movie even with the swearing, some violence, and the gang members used derogatory slang towards women. Oh, and I know nothing about football      *Note:  I am writing this review because I want to; no one connected to this movie or Amazon.com haspaid me to write it.  All opinions are mine.

B0034C9CFK|5.0|Fabulous country album.  Love songs and up beat tempo songs that keep you enthralled through the whole cd.  Duet with Lee Ann Womack is superb.  Great blend of two talented artists to an all time favorite of Mr. Gosdin.  CD is worth every penny and more.  Great Job Alan Jackson, as always.   AAA+++
0307463745|5.0|I'm a long time follower of 37signals but Rework was the final \\"kick in the butt\\" I needed to launch a product.  Great execution from cover to cover.    A must read even for people already reading the SVN blog.    And as a side note : this book smells really good :)
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I actually ended up returning this product as I don't have device to play blu-ray. So I'm reviewing the service rather than the product. The service is awesome, the whole procedure is simple, efficient and I'm quite happy about it.     Thank you,  Lisa Q
B002962RKE|5.0|Love, love, love Glee.  It's happy, funny and can turn your mood around.  I wish more series were as light-hearted as this.  The music is also sensational and therefore, the CD has a must have too!!!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable works perfect! What a price! Don't doubt it because of the low price. It works perfectly fine.
B001P9KR94|1.0|I usually wait to see movies after the hype dies down. That's because most of them do not live up their advertising budget. I started the movie last night and gave up after the first 20 minutes due to the constant and unnecessary bombardment of violence. I can see by the other reviews that I'm not missing anything except more of the same topped with a trite happy ending. This movie is for sadists or people that are unable to think for themselves and just say it's great because everybody else said it was great and it got awards, didn't it? Wake up everyone!! I would give this movie zero stars but Amazon is too generous. The fact that so many liked this film shows me that our civilization has not advanced very far indeed, not very far from the time that watching gladiators kill each other was the main form of public entertainment.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|\\"Avatar\\" on Blu-ray is absolutely amazing, the picture is truly incredible! This movie is quite an experience the first time you see it.<br /><br />I own alot of Blu-rays, nothing comes close to this picture quality!<br /><br />After seeing the movie in 3-D in the theater, I knew the Blu-ray dvd version would be great. I was also happy with the fact, that although this version doesn't have all the bells and whistles (extra footage, special features and trailers) that the extended DVD versions due out later this year will have, the Blu-ray does come with a regular DVD. Which has been great for me, because I've been able to lend it out to my friends, so they can enjoy it along with their families. Personally I would not have wanted to wait until the end of the year to see \\"Avatar\\" again. This is the highest grossing movie ever, a worldwide phenomenon, if it turns out that the extended Blu-ray dvd is that much more amazing then this version, I'll buy it again.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this unbelievable \\"epic\\" movie, do yourself a favor and watch it on Blu-ray ASAP!<br /><br />*** By the looks of reading the other reviews here, seems that some older Blu-ray player models cannot play \\"Avatar\\" without a firmware update. I do find that pretty ridiculous, not that the dvd requires an update of the Blu-ray player itself, but that they don't give consumers buying this at the store a fair warning. I would be extremely upset, if I purchased \\"Avatar\\" only to find out that I couldn't play it. This is noted at the top of Amazon's page however, good on them for that. My player is around six months old and had no issues playing the dvd. If your unsure, you may want to rent it first on Blu-ray!<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is the future of movies and I'm looking forward to more....<br /><br />Enjoy~
B002UD56I6|5.0|I still can not believe he is gone like so many other people. this DVD shows his energy his talent and love of life and music. I thought I would end up feeling so sad but I ended up realizing how MUCH he had to give even yet. RIP MIchael.
