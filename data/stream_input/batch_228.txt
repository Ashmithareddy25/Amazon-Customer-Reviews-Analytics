B00005JKMQ|5.0|ALI<br />This film is everyhting you thought it would be and then some.  I am 20 years old and did not have the plessure to live through the \\"Ali years.\\"  Although I have seen many sports documentaries and have read several books about the man, no one film or book captures the mythical essence of Ali as this movie does.<br />It is true that it would have been nice to see the young years when Clay grew up in Louisville, KY (just 30 miles from me,) and competed in the Olympics for the gold medal.  (Which he then tossed into the Ohio River.)  But, this film is about the man, the myth, and the legend.  When the film is viewed like this, it is more understandable.<br />There are some of the most powerful moments in a \\"sports\\" film ever here.  Being a serious fan of \\"Rudy,\\" \\"Hoosiers,\\"  (I love Gene Hackman and I am from Indiana,) and \\"Rocky\\", I can say that the moment were Ali gets up out of the chair in the 8th to knock out Foreman after the now classic \\"rope a dope\\" form was used to wear him out is simplely uplifting.  Is it correct to the actual event?  No, I have the HBO DVD special to prove it.  But it doesn't matter.  Like I said, this film is about Ali, not the history of what Ali did.<br />Some things that make this movie special:  They really hit each other.  No \\"Rocky\\" high uppercuts that don't even graze Mr. T or Apollo Creed.  Jamie Foxx is a brillant actor and extremely funny.  \\"I'm just a black jew who can't read or write and that's half drunk.\\"  The fact that Will Smith and his wife make a love scene covencing because they really and truely are IN LOVE!...  Howard is played brillantly in this movie.  You can't tell that it's an actor!...  \\"And Foreman goes DOWN HARD to the mat!...\\"  That call makes my spine tingle.<br />The most powerful moment of all is when Malcom X is shot and killed.  When I saw it in the theature, everyone was silent and teary-eyed.  That may be the best thing about this movie and ultimately, Ali.  Black, white, yellow, red, purple, you can fill things in this movie for the times they lived in, for the things they went through, and for Ali the man, the myth, the legend, himself.<br />If you never see another movie about sports in your life, see this.  Will Smith is stunning.  He IS ALI for due purposes.  The acting is great and the film as a whole is stunning.  Just brillant.........
0451526384|5.0|This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.<br />It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she cannot act upon her desires. <br />Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire.
1587990717|1.0|Nassim's point on how luck is claimed as skill would be great if supported by facts.  His writing style is very anecdotal, repetitive, and hard to read. This book reads like one of those business presentations that you listen to and then wonder what you've heard after it's over.
0767849493|1.0|Clerks was excellent.  Mallrats was okay.  Chasing Amy was a little better than okay.  Dogma Blew.  I didn't even so much as crack one bit of laughter while I was watching this godawful piece of tripe.  I was extremely let down.  Even Chris Rock was dull.  Something I once thought was an impossiblity.  I recommend this to any insomniac for a sure-fire cure to their affliction.  Mere words can't capture the essence of how putrid this movie was.  For the love of humanity, please don't be foolish like myself and actually BUY this movie.
B00005RY7X|1.0|Next Stop - red leather pants.  You go, WK.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Hey this is not only a classic Wu Tang Record, this is a classic Hip hop record. As I listen to this cd today it sounds way more cutting edge than anything that is out in 2002. The beats and rhymes are definetly next level, and sound as good today as they did back in 1996. To bad that in 2002 their are not records that sound like this...
B00005JKJA|3.0|This movie is Lynch at his best! I would have rated it a 5 if it wasn't for the DVD's lack of special features. One major problem is there is no chapter selection. After viewing this film 5 times already, I have become a little irritated by the fact that I cannot view particular scenes in a non-linear breakdown. If figuring out this movie is important to you this feature would of been nice to have. Also, it would of been nice to have a making of or interview session with the cast. Besides that the visual and audio quality are great. In the same tradition as Lost Highway Lynch has created a masterpiece that will be anaylized for the rest of time. Definately a classic. Buy it now!! I'm just waiting now for Lost Highway on DVD...whatz up?
B00005MEW1|4.0|Dark and deep realization, bigger with the new music
B00005JKJA|3.0|Before it became one of the most acclaimed films of 2001, David Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was actually going to be a television series (a la &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) before ABC scrapped the idea.  As a result, you get a film that's innovative and intriguing, but also plays like a sitcom at moments when it should be commandingly theatrical.  The performances of the lead actresses (Naomi Watts &amp; Laura Harring) also seem weak and unconvincing (well, not convincing enough to see this 2 1/2 hour movie through), another element carried over from TV-land.<br />Plot: a woman named Rita is involved in a car wreck, gets amnesia, meets a Hollywood hopeful named Betty, and the rest of the movie follows their misadventures through Lynch's usual bizarre mindscape.  Examples of what you'll see during &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;: Midgets with links to the underworld(?); Cowboys who provide useful information; and retro 1950's dance numbers.<br />I've always found Lynch to be a pretty overrated director, stealing the thunder from other directors who do better work and get less credit (David Cronenberg comes to mind), but &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is clearly his best film since &quot;Blue Velvet,&quot; in part because it requires the focus of the viewer to piece together the mystery.  Unlike the self-indulgent, equally overlong &quot;Lost Highway,&quot; which was trickery told within the 'logic' of a dream, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is hypnotic and complicated (where it counts).  Lynch's sense of humor is also more prominent here (note the cappucino scene).<br />It may raise more questions than it answers, but it IS an achievement in this day and age to see a movie that sticks in your head long after you've left the theater.  That's what &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; has to offer.
B00000DC7J|5.0|This is it. I think that the other reviewers have said everithing there is to say about this album.  But as an Argentinian, I just felt the need to write something about the extraordinare Astor Piazzolla. Evwn though I'm to young to have witnessed and understood his music while he was alive (I'm 20).  His music is timeless.  I like to think about his music as the soundtrack of Buenos Aires. Driving through Bs As Downtown with Piazzola on, is a incredible experience. Nothing can compare to that. <BR>Thank you Astor.
B00005JKED|1.0|Not a typical role for Denzel, but being that I love his acting abiity I thought I would watch the movie.  Suffice it to say that the  movie was far more violent for my taste, and the ending wasn't to my liking....I thought it would have been far more satisfying to have denzels character caught and punished for his crimes rather than to see him go down like that....I felt like it was the same o' same o' sterotype of the african-american male who is either a drug-dealer, rapist, murderer etc.  I left the theater feeling disgusted, utterly disatisfied and that the movie had been a total waste of my time and money...
B00005O5CM|5.0|This was a TRULY FUNNY movie!Reese Witherspoon took the ill-used term &quot;dumb blonde&quot; and put it to task.  As a graduate in fashion and recently dumped by her self absorbed boyfriend who sees her as a less than perfect girlfriend for a soon to be law student Reese witherspoon  as Elle Woods shows that with determination, guts and grit that one can overcome any obstacle and prejudices.<BR>      I first saw reese in a lifetime movie as a deaf mute girl...I knew then that she was going to be a good actress but never did I forsee that she would be this good...of all the young actresses I think she has the potential to be the next lauren bacall!
B00005RFAI|4.0|P!nk's newest album MISSUNDAZSTOOD is probably her smartest offering yet, which I know is hard to say since its only her sophomore album. Ditching the R&B act, she goes in favor of a more rock oriented sound, thanks to the help of Linda Perry who was involved in most of this album. The result is a smart album, filled with deeply personal songs about demanding respect from guys, disfunctional family values and dealing with the problems, personal issues, and other issues many people in this life can relate to. Perhaps the most poignant and beautiful song on this album is the closing track, \\"My Vietnam\\". However, there are other strong points here, including \\"Family Portrait\\", \\"Gone To California\\", \\"Eventually\\", etc. Linda Perry joins P!nk on the track \\"Lonely Girl\\", and Steven Tyler joins her on \\"Misery\\". The only mis-step on this album is \\"Get This Party Started\\" and the title track, which just don't seem to fit the overall vibe of the album. Another mis-step in the same vein, the songs \\"Just Like A Pill\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" are almost identical, in their messages and meanings underneath. Otherwise this is a song set. P!nk shows us that she has the makings of a great pop star, who is worthy of that title, she provides music with in depth meaning underneath it all, unlike Miss Nobody Spears. Give this one a try!
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has brought about an entirely new concept to music.  I have always enjoyed about every genre of music, so when my senses were introduced to that new age persona that stands out amongst the rest, I became a believer.  A music aficionado by nature, a  poet by profession, I am convinced this is album is for you if you held an appreciation to a more new age, a more artistic musician, bearing in some resemblance to the artists, \\"The Art of Noise, 1984's release of \\"Moments In Love.\\"  The song, &quot;Only Time&quot; was featured in &quot;Sweet November.&quot;  Starring Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves. (A romantic drama where Enya (New Age chanteuse), contributed her album's first single.)   After sampling several of her songs, including her appearance track on &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; Soundtrack song entitled &quot;Lothlorien,&quot; I suggest it's \\"Music to soothe your inner-soul, taking you on a blissful journey upon reality's wings.\\"
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow's newest offering CMON CMON is definately an exceptional album. The album contrasts from night and day, the sunny opening &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, to the closing sorrowful &quot;Weather Channel&quot;, Sheryl covers a lot of ground here. The album is more upbeat than her past excellent album THE GLOBE SESSIONS, but even her carefree songs have their lowpoints, like if you really listen, there's a contradiction between the carefree sound and the lyrics. When I say lowpoint, I mean introspection, not as in the songs being bad quality in lyrics or whatmay. The first single &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; is the perfect summer companion, a great song but honestly the weakest song offered here, not to say its a bad song though. &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is one of the best here, very emotional ballad like song. Emmylou Harris offers her background harmony vocals on the acoustic &quot;Weather Channel&quot; which is a song I can deeply relate to, felt like she wrote it just for me. Natalie Maines from Dixie Chicks joines Sheryl on the americana type song &quot;Abilene&quot;. Other guest artists include Gweneth Paltrow, Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, Don Henley and many more. Other highlights on this seamless set include &quot;Over You&quot;, &quot;It's Only Love&quot;, &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Diamond Road&quot;. Excellent album, almost my favorite Sheryl album, but her album GLOBE SESSIONS takes that title! Give this one a try! Perfect companion for the summer!
B000002G23|5.0|I am not the most ardent fan of box sets.  If I could have my way, they would not exist.  I say this because, as a rule of thumb, box sets generally serve two purposes:  (1) to clean the &quot;vaults&quot; of an artist's unreleased material which they were not satisfied with before, and (2) pawn off upon you inferior versions (alternate takes) of songs to make you believe that you could actually be interested in something that did not end up being good enough for release.  In addition, I feel most box sets, or comprehensive collections of artists work, leave off deserving tracks.  And eventually, after a while, the novelty of such a format tends to bore me.  I mean, do you really want to wade through a huge collection of subpar tracks to get to the really good ones?  I think not.      But rarely (and only rarely) does such a set make my cynicism about this genre turn into satisfaction.  Message In A Box is that box set.  The one word I could use to sum up its quality is  perfect.  Where else can you get an immensely successful band's entire studio recordings and have it be all of high caliber?  The Police were one of very few bands that could boast such a quality body of work; everything, even from the very beginning, was vital.  And here, for a bit less than the price of 4 CD's, you get the equivalent of about 6 albums of material, 78 tracks in all, and almost none of it filler (I say almost because Don't Stand So Close To Me '86 is an aberration that should never have been recorded).  My personal favorites are discs 2 and 3, which contain the better side (2nd) of Regatta de Blanc, the Zenyatta Mondatta and Ghost In The Machine records, and the best of the B-sides.I really like how the tracks are formatted here.  You can listen to complete albums in order and then hear the &quot;outtakes&quot; to get a greater perspective of the creative direction going on at the time.  And I might add, that back then, such outtakes never made it onto albums simply because of the time constraints of vinyl, and not necessarily because those songs weren't good enough.    Absolutely a must buy for even the casual Police fan because there is far more than enough here to satisfy, plus you don't have to break the bank to afford it.  For a completist, it's exactly the word.  Complete.
B000063DS1|5.0|\\"It's the Last Waltz, but that doesn't mean the party's over.\\"  This may have been the final concert for the original configuration of The Band, but thanks to this wonderful, expanded release, and the forthcoming dvd of the movie, you can enjoy the party over and over and over.<br />And what a party it was!  The Band played a set of their own music, and then followed that by hosting a who's who of rock legends: Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Dr. John, Neil Diamond, Bobby Charles and the man who brought them together in the first place--Ronnie Hawkins.  And Ringo Starr, Ron Wood, Stephen Stills sit in on a couple of jams after the concert proper was over.  The Band are also joined by Emmylou Harris and The Staples for special studio efforts to contribute to this celebration, to this last waltz.<br />This four disc compilation gives you everything that was on the original 3 lp. or 2 disc sets, and throws in an additional 24 (count `em, 24!) tracks.  There are more performances from the concert itself, including the previously mentioned jams, plus some concert rehearsals, and some studio ideas or demos.  This certainly helped me to have a fuller, grander sense of this historical event.  This new box set also includes new notes and background about both the concert and the movie (directed by Martin Scorsese), and lots of never seen before photos, too.<br />Highlights for me:  another great version of Stagefright; Muddy Waters singing Mannish Boy (simmering blues); Van Morrison's Caravan really kicks (and so did Van--see the movie!); Bob Dylan leading The Band through a couple of numbers they did during the 65/66 tours--Baby Let Me Follow You Down and I Don't Believe You; Emmylou and Levon trading verses on Evangeline; and The Staples lending their oh-so-soulful voices to The Weight (Beautiful, says Mavis Staples at the very end of the number, and she's so right).<br />To me, The Band are simply the best.They never sought fame and fortune.  It was all about the music.  Hit singles?  Forget it.  Fancy light shows at their concerts?  No way!  They gave us their heart and souls through the music and left a rich, rich legacy for all of us to enjoy.  Their impact could never be measured by chart success, but it was astounding on a whole other level.  These guys took Dylan's music to new realms during those wild electric sets in 65/66.  After hearing The Band's debut \\"Music From Big Pink\\" Eric Clapton shut down the ego machine called Cream.  The Band were once on the cover of Time magazine.  They played at Woodstock and Watkins Glen.  Their first two records are 2 of the most incredible listening experiences in all of rock music.  Their live set \\"Rock of Ages\\" is one of the best concert discs ever.<br />This box set may not be the place to start for some, but if you enjoyed the Last Waltz the first time, or you have a sincere interest in any of the guest artists who helped The Band bid farewell, you should certainly check out this expanded re-release.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|I loved the movie, and I think the soundtrack contributes a lot to the movie. The music is daring. It covers a lot of emotional ground and moves easily from calm, introspective, romantic moments to moments of grandeur, fear and real power.<br />I've been listening to this soundtrack more than anything else for the past few months. I like every track on it.<br />I was previously a fan of Enya, and her contributions are wonderful.<br />It's hard to sum up what sort of music is on this soundtrack simply because it has such a wide variety of mood, although it is all classical/choral. Therefore, it is, unfortunately, hard to tell what sort of person might like it, or something like &quot;if you liked such-and-such, you'll like this.&quot; I am not personally familiar with any other soundtrack, or any album for that matter, like it. All I can say is that I really enjoy every minute of it.
B00005JKCF|4.0|An excursion to Columbia University science lab transforms the bespectacled Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) with miraculous vision, sculpted body after a genetically-altered spider bits him. He possesses agility in leaping from skyscrapers and can spin webs from his wrist. Henceforth he assumes the identity Spider-man to combat evil manifested in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), a Species-look-alike perpetrator that terrrorizes the city with a glider that drops bombs. <br />Spider-Man embodies the heroics created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who had graced the popular Marvel Comics to become an comic icon as a crime-buster - and now the film further increases the fanaticism. It is a US 140 million blockbuster and gaudy with sleek costumes and galvanizing stunts. It is digitally-enhanced F/X to capture panoramic swings in its most realistic and The Times Square action-sequence is one of the most dazzling in cinematic history. <br />Yet the superhero adventure fails to surprise because of its conventional storyline of good-vs-evil. The self-discovery and mutation renders so much punch that the second-half falls relatively lack-lustre. Fortunately Spider-Man spins a complex web of humanity and empathy for the characters - and Tobey Maguire as the lead is the emotional core who captivates with his vulnerability in handling his growth traumas, doubts and fears. No less sterling is Willem Dafoe who is all hysterics and maniacal in his split personality inherited from the aftermath of a blundered experiment. Kirsten Dunst as his love-interest Mary Jane, James Franco as his buddy and even his uncle Ben played by Cliff Robertson show surprising dimensions. <br />Spider-Man is thus an evocative tale of a hero struggling with his adolescence, betrayal and murder. And Sam Raimi displays the same sensitivity here with his eariler works like Darkman with his flawed avenger. He directs it with eye-popping visuals like Army of Darkness and the comic hero resonates in its true-self. Its brooding hero is what makes Spider-Man a nifty web - and Maguire has definitely triumphed the cynics with his soulful spin.
B00005OAIE|5.0|You may have heard the first release off of this album, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;.  I was hooked after the one song...so I bought the album.  Luckily for me, the rest of the album is just as dynamic.  It incorporates jazz and blues and makes it contemporary enough to be played along side the likes of Train and the Dave Matthews Band.  The lyrics are thoughtful...most people will be able to relate to most of what he sings about...a &quot;quarter life crisis&quot;, &quot;my stupid mouth&quot;, &quot;am I living it right?&quot;...we've all had those moments.  This is an excellent album all-round...it's been in my CD player ever since I bought it (3 months ago)...a must buy!
0345440757|2.0|Like the controvery over &quot;Baby Wise&quot; I think that people need to arrive by themselves, on what is good advise, and what is bad, and make their own decisions about what works for them when raising a baby. Too many people are searching for the &quot;right&quot; method, and the &quot;right&quot; way to do things. That is great... but none of the publications out there are all right and all wrong. You need to use what makes sense for you, without doubting yourself when you make a decision outside of the outlines of ANY book! Care for your children. Love them and give them the attention they need. Learn to understand the developemental stages that dictate behavior, and learn how to make the best decisions you know how... I use tips from MANY books, but following ANY book to closely will lead to regret. <BR>     This book is an example of a person who writes their OPINION. Some of it is good, some of it obvious, and some of it is just plain &quot;different&quot;. She writes in a style that is interesting, and the things written can be very reinforcing to a new parent... BUT it can lead to &quot;bible following&quot; of its text... parents following it to a tee, and missing the point of ANY parenting book... I think there are a LOT of better books out there, by people that have better credentials than this author. Nothing can be considered abusive, of course, but some of the advise is confusing, and vague... Look elswhere for MORE information. It is an easy read, just not the best... It does have good sleep routine advise... which is readily available other places too.... but the way it is presented her, has it's value... and there is less contriversary than other publications.
0679731725|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite novels. The story of a butler, Mr Sterling the main character. It also features his father also a butler and Ms Kenton the housekeeper. The book offers insights into the workings of a stately english home during the time preceding the Second World War. What I particularly enjoyed about the book are the characters and the roles they portray. Mr Stevens the younger is an incredible character that is unaware he is trapped within a class system and actually likes his role within the system. It is his sense of duty that enables his naivety to develop throughout the novel. This naive sense of duty to his most noble profession, follows a procession of events that would impact greatly upon the lives of most people. However Stevens is only aware of his sense of duty to his master. Much like a dog retruning a ball to his owner, Stevens remains unaware of the events that are unfolding around him. <BR>The role of Ms Kenton in the book is to highlight the unreal world that Mr Stevens lives within. There is an obvious sense of closeness between the two characters, however due to Stevens' sense of being honourable and the duty that comes from being honourable, this allows only evotional frustration to Ms Kenton. Stevens is a portrait of repressed identity. He is unable to come to terms with his feelings and is unable to offer opinions about the politics of his master or more importantly about his own emotions. <BR>The Remains of the Day is a wonderful book. It is extremely well written by Ishiguro and has become a close friend. It has become a book that I return to when I want to read something of the highest quality. It is a piece of writing that I believe will pass the test of time.

B0000639FE|5.0|I had wanted to purchase this movie, but when I heard that a special edition was coming out, I waited it out. It is worth the wait.This has many features that you would expect from a Cameron Crowe DVD <BR>   one example is a feature on how to be an agent. <BR>Many years later, it is ironic that the agent that this movie is based on, Leigh Steinberg, is going through a fall very similar to Jerry Maguire.
0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight kicks off an adventure that you'll never want to see the end of.  This is hands down one of the best books I've read, and it introduces a world which will amaze and thrill you until it is all over. The character development is amazing and the adventure plots are uncanny. The characters are very realistic and some characters such as Raistlin, is so complex it will take you six books to truly understand him. To put it simply, the writing is genious.<BR>  I truly wasn't a fantasy book reader until I read this book. This book hooked me unto the genre, however I have yet to find a book which can compare to Dragons of Autumn Twilight and the rest of the chronicles.
B00005TT77|2.0|The Best thing about this album is it reminds us how great the Beatles were! I  give two stars because of the excellent cover of Two of Us. Buy Beatles albums instead.
B00005YXZH|5.0|First of all, let me say that I am sick of people who constantly complain that each new Wilco album sounds different from the last (or from Uncle Tupelo).  Yeah, the band is evolving. Get over your extended mourning for Uncle Tupelo, already! Would these people have complained that &quot;Revolver&quot; was so different from &quot;Meet the Beatles?&quot; Doubt it.  <br />So the same is true here. I've had this album for five days; probably listened to it a dozen times. It just keeps getting better and better, much like &quot;Being There&quot; did. The most easy-to-like songs, upon first listen, are probably &quot;Kamera&quot; and &quot;Jesus Etc.&quot; Both undeniably great songs--&quot;Kamera&quot; is the pop masterpiece of the album.<br />I'll spare you a song-by-song evaluation of the album, but keep one thing in mind: Jeff Tweedy is, in my mind, one of the most exciting artists around right now--the guy refuses to be kept in any mold, and is constantly searching for new influences and directions. You may not be inclined to like his move towards electronica, for example, but I hope people will give this album a chance. It could be better than Summerteeth, and I doubted I'd ever say that about any album. We should all be grateful that we're able to take part--even as listeners--in the group's development.  I dare anyone to mention a group that has developed as much, or evolved as completely, as Wilco has in the course of just four albums (not counting the Mermaid Ave. collaborations), from A.M. to YHF.
B00005T7I1|4.0|It ... me off that companies such as Touchstone pictures even release great films like Dick Tracey and Who Framed Roger Rabbit on DVD with absolutely no features. I mean what's the point in even buying them if you already have them on VHS, the only difference between the 2 copies is that you don't have to rewind the dvd, lol. Other than that there's no real reason to buy this Dick Tracey:  No Features Version. This is well made film with a classic look and great cast that I've been waiting for on dvd for awhile but ...assed dvd. It's almost like they don't respect the film and don't think it's worth the effort but this film is as are a lot of movies that have gotten no feature dvds. I must say I'm tired of it.  Meanwhile you got bad films like Armageddon being crammed with features, I don't get it.
1577311523|4.0|This is a great book, written by someone who awaked. It is easy to read and easy to understand, but doesn't go very deep.  It help greatly in giving clarity to women regarding periods and their real meaning.    Many now a days have discover their real self and are now teaching you to live in the moment, etc., without real experience with the teaching part. It will confuse the new seeker to turn truth into what it is not. In the book of John Parker \\"Dialogue with Emerging spiritual teacher\\"(which Eckart Tolle is included) is a great example of teachers's different level of perspective being asked the same questions. \\" Teachers of One Living Advaita \\" also give a similar perspective.
B00003CXI1|3.0|First of all, I have to say that I love all of the Harry Potter books. I saw the movie on the opening day, after waiting for months to see it. The movie started out fairly faithful to the book, with the scene where Dumbledore brings Harry to his Aunt and Uncle's house. As it moved on further into the story, I was very annoyed at how they changed a lot of the scenes to make the entire movie shorter (I got really irritated even when they left out little things like making the sorting hat talk out loud when only the person wearing it could hear it). Hogwarts was exactly as I imagined it, but a lot of the computer animation looked completely fake, like the troll scene. The best part was undoubtedly the quidditch scene. It was so fast paced and exciting, and it was exactly how I had imagined it when I was reading the books. I thought all the acting was great, especially the children. Emma Watson (who played Hermione) was a spectacular Hermione, and Ron and Harry weren't bad either. I only give it three stars because of all the scenes that they cut out (originally the movie was over four hours long), and I can see why someone who hasn't ever read the books would get lost in the story line. It was mostly good for someone who has trouble visualizing all the characters and places in the books, because now I can imagine everything much better. It was a pretty good movie overall, and it would be entertaining to someone who has not read the books, but just be warned that the actual Harry Potter books are a hundred times better.
B000006OAM|5.0|(A line from &quot;When they Ring The Golden Bells&quot;).  <br />Great CD - lots of wonderful guest musicians.  This is a blessing at times but having heard Natalie with a consistent band since then (e.g. Gabe Gordon and Eric Della Penna on guitar, but I don't know all the names), I think her recent album &quot;Motherland&quot; is even better - partially due to the tightness of the band now.  i.e. most of the same musicians have been with her a few years since the Ophelia tour, even though they did not all help make that CD.  Now that they have helped make &quot;Motherland&quot;, Nat and they are better than ever.  Oh yeah, this is about Ophelia - still a great CD, and I'm pleased she gets even better as she goes on!
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay is a band that can leave you wanting only more. Their debut album is packed from start to finish with breath-taking, soul-warming music that comes from a place that few of us even know we have. Each song is a gem that is collected as you listen through the album, leaving you at the end better for your experience.<br />The range of the band and the execution of their songs is many and varied. Their song 'shiver' is fast paced and frantic, telling of a quiet longing for someone that is exploding inside the singer. Other songs, like 'wooden house', are sleepy and ethereal, drawing you in and lulling you into reverie.<br />I would recommend this album to anyone who has the desire to expand their musical horizons to include soft alternative music. It is certainly worth the money that amazon.com is asking, and will only be beneficial to own.<br />Bottom line: this is a great album, one worth the price and one that begs to be listened to.
6304082428|5.0|I could watch this movie again and again.  The acting is superb! It really brings Jane Austen's story to life.  My favorite scene is where Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are in Mrs. Collins' sitting room and Mr. Darcy blunders royally his marraige proposal!  If you love romance, there is simply no better movie.
B00004BZ0V|5.0|I find this to be a fine Clash collection!It's what it's titled:The singles,and it shows you a taste of what the band offered.I enjoy listening to it.A lot.
B00005GL0M|5.0|This is one of the Beatles' best.<br />1. Hard Day's Night-- This song is a great start ot a great album.  You just want to sing along!<br />2. I Should Have Known Better-- This has some mean harmonica on it.  Pretty good.<br />3. If I Fell-- This is a good ballad-ic song.  I like the faster concert version better, though.<br />4. I'm Happy Just To Dance With You-- This is a great song.  It makes you want to get up and dance along.<br />5. And I Love Her-- This is a sweet little song.  It's very acoustic. <br />6. Tell Me Why-- This song kind of shows that John was wearing down from writing all the other songs, but it's OK. <br />7. Can't Buy Me Love--  This is a pretty good song.  It was recorded in Paris.<br />8. Any Time At All-- This song is a almost-sad-song-yet-still-peppy song. <br />9. I'll Cry Instead-- This is my personal favorite on the album.  After the movie had been basically finished, John was asked to write one more song to fit into the movie, although it only got into the credits.  <br />10. Things We Said Today-- A good song that is a balance between minor and major keys.<br />11. When I Get Home--  When I first heard this song's chorus, I was like 'Ok, this is weird.'  This song is OK, but not a very good one.<br />12. You Can't Do That-- This is a very good song that sounds like the songs they had on 'With the Beatles'.  It is good.<br />13. I'll Be Back-- The Beatles had a keen sense of how to arrange songs on an album.  With this album, they start you off rockin, and then they slowly sober you up for the ride home, as they might've done at their early gigs.  I'll be back is a bittersweet song.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Many news and entertainment magazines divulge that Andrew is in fact the son of a Law Professor, which not only makes one question the point of \\"trailor park\\" remarks in regards to his personage -- but whether or not this 23 year old is much, much smarter than many give him credit for.<br />   The first time I saw the video for \\"Party Hard\\", I thought either this was a joke, or it HAD to be a foreign band that just \\"didn't get it\\", and was thus very amusing to watch. To my surprise, they were not only American, but as \\"serious as a heart-attack\\" -- which, one would think, makes it that much more funny (or should that be, \\"fun\\"?).<br />   Andrew's appearance, and the title track reflect his ethos. He views life as an ocean, of which we all just have to dive into and \\"Get Wet\\". Some view this album as strictly NC-17 from Track 1 until the end. Maybe that's why they love it, or hate it. Andrew himself would never stop you from thinking whatever you want in these regards, but the fact is songs like \\"Got To Do It\\" and \\"I Get Wet\\" are some of the most envigorating, uplifting tunes to grace the CD Players of the world in many years.<br />   Uplifting, you say?! Why, didn't Kurt Cobain free us of the terrible bonds of joy and happiness years ago? Please. Nirvana was a welcomed change in light of the musical landscape of the time they arrived. <br />   Now: For rock stars, we have nothing but whiners, downers and \\"oh-so-scary-guys\\". For happy pop-stars, we have nothing but squeaky clean (until Britney & Justin's stolen tapes get out), oh-so-nice teenybopper wannabes.<br />   Andrew: Doesn't whine. He's totally encouraging and uplifting, and yet tough and masculine. Comes on like a freight train of Metal, Punk and Techno Dance. Some of his band is comprised of ex-death metal and grindcore artists, and yet his lyrics at times remind you of Richard Simmons, Tae Bo and Stuart Smalley. His joyousness sounds like it could devour Marilyn Manson & Trent Reznor's dourness in one swift gulp. The Yin to Slayer's Yang!<br />  Understandably, some \\"don't get it\\". So, for these, I encourage you to A: Buy the album and B: See Andrew W.K. live. \\"What?! I don't like them, moron!\\" you might say, but listen up.<br />   I saw Andrew W.K. live, and at this show there was a group of about 5 teenagers there to see the opening and finishing acts -- but NOT Andrew! They cursed him, were disappointed, annoyed and more -- all before even seeing him perform! Three songs into AWK's set, the kids were shouting to each other, \\"He's just too nice to hate,\\" seeing how Andrew slapped everybody's extended hand in the first few \\"rows\\" of people, danced everybody's gifts over to the drum-set and back, and let several people in the audience sing along.<br />   By the last song of his gig, \\"Party Hard\\", Andrew brought dozens and dozens of people up on stage with him, where HE put kids on HIS shoulders, let them get in on the act -- and doused everyone in buckets of water! Soon thereafter those same kids that cursed him before the show had him literally lifted above THEIR heads, declaring him their new rock-king!<br />   He's just too nice to hate.
B0000636UN|4.0|With pop music at its LOWEST quality ever...when bellybuttons gangsta thug... and sampled R&B singers using OLD songs to make new ones passes for music nowadays...Sheryl Crow finally comes back and actually writes and sings music you can blast on your stereo and not feel like a total idiot!  (And has the bod to boot!)  Keep your frilly video divas and thugs, I'll take Sheryl Crow anyday!
B00003CX5P|5.0|It's one of those movies where after you see it once you think &quot;It's good&quot;, then after you see it again you think &quot;It's really good&quot;, and after you see it a third time you think &quot;Damnnnn good&quot;.  Every time you see it you pick up on some subtle little thing you hadn't yet noticed.  This movie does justice to the series.
0064409422|4.0|Whilst playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy accidentally discovers a wintry world beyond a wardrobe full of fur coats. She meets the Faun, Mr Tumnus, who invites her back to his home where he entertains her and  explains about the world of Narnia, how it is controlled by an evil witch, and confesses that he has been kind to Lucy because he is under threat of dire punishment from the witch if he doesn't deliver any child of Eve or Adam who crosses his path. But Mr Tumnus takes a chance on the witch not finding out, and lets Lucy go back to her own world. Lucy tries to convince her three companions that she has been to Narnia, but hey all laugh.<br />A few days later they all find their way into Narnia and embark on an adventure to destroy the power of the witch and save Narnia from an eternal winter where Christmas never happens. <br />This was a book that I'd never read as a child and reading it as an adult the writing seems to be a bit too sketchy and rough around the edges. I don't know if this is of any relevance to the children reading this title, but it seems odd that C. S. Lewis' contemporary, J. R. R. Tolkien, made a significantly better job of The Hobbit. It was also interesting to compare C. S. Lewis' writing with Philip Pullman's Dark Materials series, since they are so much compared. Yes, Philip Pullman's writing is very similar, except for the minor ( but important ) detail that The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe is written in first person, avoiding the annoying viewpoint problem that Philip Pullman's work suffers from.
B000001FSR|5.0|this is a stroke of geneous. i loved it the first time i listened and i must have listened to it hundreds of times since. It's an album that, like the Black Rider and Bone Machine, i'm afraid of listening to. turn of the lights and freak yourself out.
6303269826|3.0|Upon seeing &quot;Wyatt Earp,&quot; one may get the feeling that something is missing. Although I found it to be one of the best western films made in the past ten years, in no way was it able to match up with &quot;Tombstone,&quot; my all-time favorite western. The historical aspects of Wyatt Earp's life take a back-seat to an over-dramatized epic. Doc Holliday, who was played to perfection by Val Kilmer in &quot;Tombstone,&quot; is played rather stiffly and dull by Dennis Quaid, who has turned in better performances than this (think &quot;Frequency&quot;). Costner's Earp is too drab, falling not only short of his acting potential (&quot;Thirteen Days&quot;), but he also cannot seem to go one-on-one with Kurt Russell's Earp from &quot;Tombstone&quot; (which told the same story without over-playing it). The biggest drab of the movie is the OK Corrall sequence, which takes up only thirty seconds of screen-time, and is not dramatic (Lawerence Kasdan fails to capture the essence of it the way George P. Costamos did for &quot;Tombstone&quot;). Overall, a pretty good film. But if you want to see a good film about Wyatt Earp and the OK Corrall, think &quot;Tombstone.&quot; Grade: B
B00005JKMQ|2.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE AT THE THEATERS AND I LOVED IT ALOT. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THE DVD, BUT I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ALI DVD HAS NO SPECAIL FEATURES AND I DON'T THINK I WILL PURCHASE THE DVD FOR THAT VERY REASON. THE SPECAIL FEATURES ARE WHY I BOUGHT A DVD PLAYER IN THE FIRST PLACE.
6305308659|5.0|A wonderful and unique movie.<br />It successfully takes the very difficult stand that complexity is more desirable than simplicity and predictability and endless &quot;pleasantness&quot;.<br />It also has wonderful acting, and delightful images all the way through.<br />Don't miss this one. Really.
0380788624|4.0|I read both &quot;Snow Crash&quot; and &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; and had the same feelings about both:  amazingly interesting concepts, good execution for the first 75%, and then a complete and total collapse in the final chapters.  With &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, Neal Stephenson finally gets it right.  This book is an absorbing read from cover to cover and combines fiction with history and technical details in an extremely entertaining way.<br />Now if only he'd go back and re-write the endings of his other two books...
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera is one of the greatest bands of all time.  Even though I think they are pretty much broken up now, they still have their albums to live off of.  This is the best.  The songs on here are sooooo good, and soooo hard, any hard rock/metal type fan would love it.  Even though this isn't the hardest c.d. (Far Beyond Driven is) it's still the best musically and lyrically.  Make this your first Pantera c.d. if you don't have one.  Best songs are:  Mouth for War, Walk, and This Love.
0440219078|5.0|I was looking through this site, and I decided to look up reviews on The Giver. I was appauled to find so many bad reviews!<br />The Giver is one of the best books I ever read. Those who didn't understand it, or thought it was too advanced for young readers, DID NOT fully understand it! While, I admit, there was violence, and the like, it was realted to the storyline, which makes it all right. And too those who say that parents 'should not let thier children read this book', or something like that- I read it at 10 WITH my mother, who urged me to read it. So it really depends on the parent, the child's level of reading, and personal taste.<br />But hey, I'm justr a 14-year-old kid. What am I doing, telling these adults what I think?
B00004Y6RO|5.0|To be honest, the first time I heard Slipknot, I wasn't totally sure if I liked them or not, but after I finally bought the c.d., I knew I had a new favorite band.  I have this digipack which has a few extra tracks, and also the first version of this c.d. they put out with Purity on it.  This is a great c.d., and I think is probably better than Iowa.  The music is a lot harder and more raw and basic than on the other one.  If you like really hard, really good music, buy this c.d.
0385503954|4.0|McEwan gift of prose is uplifting in a time that so few new novels are able to explore the delicate subtleties of character. He crafts an intriguing tragedy.  But is it tragic or just ironic? We are lured through the novel seeking resolve and justice, yet are left at the end with an extremely skinny discourse on the role of the author/God and his/His ability to manipulate any outcome (or not).  Instead of seeking resolution, or atonement in the final pages, the reader witnesses an all to common must-hurry-and-finish ending that ultimately leaves the characters underdeveloped, and the plot ambiguous. McEwan's structuring of the novel is curious. He divides it by two narratives.  Briony's narrative, essential to the theme, appears at both the beginning and the end.  Stuck in the middle is Robbies inconsistent narrative as he trudges through the evacuation at Dunkurk.  In retrospect, this middle narrative has little relation to the story and advances the plot only slightly.  The reader continues through the part seeking some link to the complixities that were developed in the first section, but is left with little.  Perhaps if McEwan had Robbie's narrative develop his incarceration, or better yet had given Cecelia a voice, the novel would have been tighter. Most curious is the ending when the 70 year-old Briony returns to her family estate which has been turned into a hotel.  This is reminiscent of Waugh's Brideshead Revisited.  Perhaps the novel should have been called Briony's Crime Revisited.
B00004U8H4|4.0|American Psycho is an awesome movie, no matter what anyone may say.  It is hard to understand, and the plot is all twisted up, but still a good movie.  I still don't understand the ending of it, but the movie is still worth watching and trying to understand anyway.  Christian Bale does an awesome job as the main character Patrick Bateman.  Definetly a very controversial movie, but overall it is a very good movie to watch.

We all get fooled, so much fooled that most people do not realize how much of their life is a reult of luck etc. <br />Bear in mind! those people that claim not to understand what the book has to say, have not got the point. That's all.<br />It is also wonderful that he is mixing it with interesting and good written stories and anectods.<br />A must read, for everyone that knows how we people tend to have mistakes. If you are sure that you are smart enough, do not wast your time. You are probably &quot;smart&quot; already.
B000001GAM|5.0|This is probably the finest Bruckner 9 I know. A composer friend of mine says it's his favourite performance of anything by anyone! Giulini's deliberate tempi in the first movement give ample time to 'enjoy the scenery' as it were, but they also build incredible tensions, that quite literally explode in the coda. Giulini's vehemence in the second movement is amazing; the VPO trombones and timpani excel themselves. And the final movement is so much more effective and moving for not being over-played. In the last few bars Giulini creates a magical sense of the music finally leading out into the eternal and we feel as though that's where it was going all along. Truly a magnificent performance.
B000002J09|4.0|When I read a review about this album being one of the best rocknroll album in history I became a bit curious. Although knowing about Led Zeppelin I never exactly gave me the time to listen to them. Then I saw a list of 100 best rocknroll albums in History in a magazine and this one was #1. I had to get the LP. I was a slight disapointing. This was a really good album But Ive listened to better.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Proof that record company executives are big fat idiots, Wilco defies to corporations and creates an album of subtle beauty that clearly signifies the first classic of the year if not the millenium. The drama started when Wilco completed Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and upon giving it to their record label Reprise last summer, the bigwigs at Reprise acted like it was made out of cyanide.  The lack of a catchy single apparently prevented the label from realizing the sublime beauty of every song.  The funny thing about the whole situation is that when Wilco found another record label it ended up being Nonesuch Records which is owned by AOL Time Warner the same parent compnay of Reprise. So basically the compnay paid for the album twice.<BR> Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is the best album that this Chicago band has ever had.  It is a sterotypicaly male record produced unstereotypically.  Think of it as an alt-country Kid A.  The songs are filled with introspective lyrics and country themed electronic atmosphere. \\"I am trying to break your heart\\" is a song filled with drunken swagart and love from an alchohalic. \\"You were so right when you said I've been drinking/what was I thinking we I said goodnight\\". \\"In Ashes of American Flags\\" singer Jeff Tweedy sings about the money hungry country. \\"I would like to salute the ashes of American flags/and all the falling leavs filling up shopping bags\\".  In \\"Reservations\\", he sings that his love is true despite past mistakes and his own insecurities in a song that could only be written by a man. \\"I've always been distant and uve always told lies for love\\". Later he sings \\"I've got reservations of so many things/but not about you\\"  Listen to it over and over again its meaning and beauty increase with every listen.<BR> The name Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of the radio codes once used by the navy.  In this album, Jeff Tweedy and Wilco have created a musical code of lost love, dreams, and poliitics that may not be ready for the radio or major label CEOs, but should be ready for anyone that loves great American music.
1573226521|5.0|I saw the movie first, and thought it was decent.  Then I decided to read the book.  I must say, that they are almost two totally different stories, and the book is (of course) much better.<br />This book has a Lord of the Flies theme going for it, but it is much more up to date, and the message it sends is more subtle with symbolism and several smaller themes inside the main story.  I think this is one of those books that if you detest the society we live in, you can relate to it, and be moved by the writing.<br />If you have seen the movie you MUST read the book!  The story the book tells is so much better, so if you liked the movie you will love the book - and if you hated the movie give the book a shot anyway.<br />Garland is an unknown genius, I will be buying his other book very soon!
0671027344|5.0|This is not the most difficult or profound book you will ever read. It is, however, one of those rare titles that remind us of youth and the conflicts that accompany growth. Chbosky's treatment of feelings is particularly interesting, as he delves into love, friendship, fear, etc., and shows how these condense in the mind of a truly wonderful (and at times inspiring) character, Charlie. Finally, the notions of love and friendship portrayed through Charlie are, contrary to what some have written here, true to the typical teenage mind. It is true that teenagers rarely express themselves as openly and honestly as Charlie. This should not be a criticism of Chbosky's work, but rather, an American culture which breeds fear of feelings and expression in boys.
B00005ATQF|3.0|The first 45 minutes of 'Full Metal Jacket' is one of the greatest things ever put on film.  One reason why Kubrick is called the master or genius is because of awesome sequences like these.  I cannot imagine any other director creating such a sequence so perfectly.  The other half of the movie....wel...<br />It has it moments, but I can't see what Kubrick is trying to say.  The film fails in that it did not create any real characters.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is without a doubt an instant cult classic. However, a lot of people complained about the ending not coming together or answering questions from the film. Here's where the beauty of DVD and Internet access come in. WATCH THE EXTRAS on the DVD. GO through the entire website (its creepy and somewhat confusing, like the movie I suppose)and it will answer any questions this movie left you asking. Especially read the book mntioned in the movie that is part of the DVD extra andon the website. If you're into movies that leave you with a little guess work to do at the end, Donnie Darko is the one for you.<BR>   P.S.-If you haven't seen the movie yet,don't go to the website or (obviously) the dvd extras. You either won't understand it or you'llruin it for yourself ;)
B00003W8NM|5.0|...  From the preview I first saw it didn't really seem to have much to it and I didn't really have any interest in it.  When I finally did get around to seeing it (only because I really like Brad Pitt as an actor) I instantly fell in love with this movie.  Not only was the acting superb, but the whole story was so slick and original.  It just really blew me away, and then the DVD, don't get me started.  The DVD is loaded with extras, hidden stuff, and even the case it comes in is awesome.  Trust me, for those of you out there that think this is some stupid \\"guy fighting\\" movie, think again, there is so much more then you think.  Yes, I am talking to the females out there, give it a look, trust me.  Also check out David Finchers other movies (Seven, The Game, and the new one, Panic Room)  great movies.

B00005JKG7|4.0|John Carpenter's 'The Fog' has all the elements of a great ghost story, and is one of his best films. I have seen the advanced copy of this DVD (perhaps it is a Region 2 version), and the transfer was very solid. My American Carpenter coterie should really enjoy this DVD- that is, when it is actually realeased in the USA. For those exposed to modern horror films only- take a look at this film- its a true classic 'ghost story', unlike anything recent. Read the rest of the reviews for this film, and you will see how desperately this film needs to be released on Region 1 DVD. Its really a good film.
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember is a heart-throbbing, stomach-fluttering, and tear-jerking novel in which you find what true love means. Landon Carter, newly elected ASB President, needs a date for homecoming. The only problem is that is just a few days away and most the girls have already been asked. He skims through his yearbook and the only girl left that is \\"reasonable\\" is Jamie Sullivan. This year Landon had seen her in a different light, he had dropped Science and the only class that period was Drama and Jamie was in that class. Once he saw her he realized she wasn't the little 1st grader he remembers, but a young woman. He then asks her to Homecoming, and she wants to but must get her permission from her father; a priest.<br /> Jamie and Landon attend Homecoming together and he sees how truly nice she is. When a girl throw-up in the bathroom Jamie is the 1st one to help her clean up. In the next few weeks the Drama class decides to perform the play Hegbert Sullivan called \\"The Christmas Angel\\" Landon is chosen to play the lead man and Jamie the Angel. <br /> The big day of the performance comes, the seats are filled, even Landon's friends (who made-fun of him for being in the play) attended. Unfortunately Landon was not able to wish Jamie good luck and had not seen her before he began. Landon was on stage doing his seen by himself, the crowd was silent all eyes watching, then it became more silent than imaginable. You probably could have heard a pin drop, and he turned around to see Jamie different then ever before. In a long flowing white dress, her hair down with sparkles in it, and make-up on. He turned around and in the most sincere voice said, \\"You're beautiful.\\" She truly was and that's where he saw her for who she was inside and out, for the first time.<br /> I would recommend this book for anyone that is 8 and older. It teaches a great life lesson, and what kindness does to a person. This was a wonderful book and should be read by many.<BR>The story takes you further than any; you see the true kindness of a heart. You see the love of two people grow. You see how the personal will can be the greatest strength of all. You see something unexpected, something that will make your heart tighten. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, not wanting to waste one minute. To see where this love journey begins and ends, you must read A Walk to Remember, written by Nicolas Sparks.
B000063DS1|5.0|Having bought the bootlegged Complete Last Waltz, I was already familiar with a lot of the unreleased material.  As soon as my package from Amazon.com came, I put in Disc 2 and listened to Acadian Driftwood (my favorite Band song)and was blown away by the sound quality.  The 80 page book that comes with the CD's is mint (with a heartwarming 2 pages devoted to Rick Danko and Richard Manuel's memory) and a great have for any Band fan (or music fan for that matter).  For a group that had little commerical success, this is a 4 CD legacy that will hopefully be enjoyed by generations to come.  I know I'll be buying the DVD the day it comes out.  R.I.P. Rick and Richard
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember is a heart-throbbing, stomach-fluttering, and tear-jerking novel in which you find what true love means. Landon Carter, newly elected ASB President, needs a date for homecoming. The only problem is that is just a few days away and most the girls have already been asked. He skims through his yearbook and the only girl left that is \\"reasonable\\" is Jamie Sullivan. This year Landon had seen her in a different light, he had dropped Science and the only class that period was Drama and Jamie was in that class. Once he saw her he realized she wasn't the little 1st grader he remembers, but a young woman. He then asks her to Homecoming, and she wants to but must get her permission from her father; a priest.<br /> Jamie and Landon attend Homecoming together and he sees how truly nice she is. When a girl throw-up in the bathroom Jamie is the 1st one to help her clean up. In the next few weeks the Drama class decides to perform the play Hegbert Sullivan called \\"The Christmas Angel\\" Landon is chosen to play the lead man and Jamie the Angel. <br /> The big day of the performance comes, the seats are filled, even Landon's friends (who made-fun of him for being in the play) attended. Unfortunately Landon was not able to wish Jamie good luck and had not seen her before he began. Landon was on stage doing his seen by himself, the crowd was silent all eyes watching, then it became more silent than imaginable. You probably could have heard a pin drop, and he turned around to see Jamie different then ever before. In a long flowing white dress, her hair down with sparkles in it, and make-up on. He turned around and in the most sincere voice said, \\"You're beautiful.\\" She truly was and that's where he saw her for who she was inside and out, for the first time.<br /> I would recommend this book for anyone that is 8 and older. It teaches a great life lesson, and what kindness does to a person. This was a wonderful book and should be read by many.<BR>The story takes you further than any; you see the true kindness of a heart. You see the love of two people grow. You see how the personal will can be the greatest strength of all. You see something unexpected, something that will make your heart tighten. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, not wanting to waste one minute. To see where this love journey begins and ends, you must read A Walk to Remember, written by Nicolas Sparks.
6305508550|5.0|This movie is served best at the end of a long week when you find yourself repeating, &quot;I hate my job, I hate my job.&quot; If you've ever tried to avoid your boss to get out of an assignment or have fantisized about destroying tempermental office equipment, this is the movie for you.
B000002H6C|3.0|Actually, this is one of the poorest Metallica's albums after \\"Kill 'Em All\\". There are some beautiful tunes, but sophisticated people will not like the sound, musicians will not like James Hetfield's singing. This album produced the hit \\"Harvester Of Sorrow\\" which is the only song that's worth listening. The ballad \\"One\\" is nothing further than a sequence of \\"Fade To Black\\" and \\"Welcome Home\\": it is built on the same model, sounds very trivial, and shows their influence by Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" that first set exactly the same model. It is the last ballad of this type that Metallica created.<BR>Speaking of sound, I feel like this is a demo album, there's no background, as if they play in a basement. Compared to the sound of the previous two albums, \\"Ride The Lightning\\" and \\"Master Of Puppets\\", it is vague.<BR>However, instrumental parts are performed nicely.
B0000024Z7|5.0|There are so many other reviews here that say exactly what I want to say about this music so I will not add much.  I think it is much better than Santana's most popular and excellent albums, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Abraxas&quot;.  There are no hit songs here, just the original Santana band hitting their musical peak in an inspired work of intense power and beauty.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Stone Flower&quot; (#8) and &quot;La Fuente Del Ritmo (#9), both of strong Brasilian flavor, and &quot;Waves Within&quot; (#2) - I dare you to figure out the meter this one is in.  I don't care much for Track #5 and 6, but everything else is close to perfection.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Not even fun.  There are movies that are so preposterous you just have to sit back and laugh.  Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies.  Hugh Jackman seems in pain a good part of the time, and not because of what his character is enduring--but rather what he as an actor is having to suffer through.  The other actors seem to either not sense how appalling their dialogue is and how ridiculous the action and plot are, or not care.
B00005OAIE|5.0|As a very recent college grad from Austin, TX, I can see how John Mayer has captured the hearts of my fellow school friends, much like Bob Scneider did, but he is not only for girls... beyond his boyish good looks, his music extends his appeal to people young and old.  I don't agree with the editorial review about John's shallow and bland music.  Does anyone else really doubt how genuine he is when he writes about his feelings of growing into an adult?  I believe his songs are heartfelt, and it certainly comes across in all the tracks on \\"Room For Squares.\\"  My favorites being \\"No Such Thing\\", which describes many early 20-something's emotions about \\"the real world\\" in less than 4 minutes, \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\", and \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", which makes me laugh, because I think we've all experienced the same situation on either side.  <br />In sum, this album is a fantastic collection of a young songwriter who is voicing his own doubts and newfound wisdom through music.  It shouldn't matter if his feelings are wrong or right...his music is honest in its appeal.  Its easy-listening qualities make this album the perfect driving companion, as well as great background music for relaxing.  I love this album and John Mayer.  Amazon, let us young kids have our fun and stop pretending you know everything!
B00005JKED|5.0|This is the best-written, best-directed, best-acted action flick I have ever seen.  Antoine Fuqua handles its complicated sequences and plot  convolusions masterfully.  Denzel Washington gives us a controlled and yet explosive portrayal of a character whose multiple layers peel away until we see the raw creature at the core.  Ethan Hawke does his best work in years.  Fuqua also uses an incredible supporting cast to their best advantage, including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray.  The scene of her screaming over the fence at Washington is worth the movie all by itself.  The dialogue is consistently intelligent.  It has been ages since I've seen a script that tells a such a complicated story so effectively.  And, last but not least, the production values are worthy of the rest of the film.  This movie is a treat for the eyes, the ears, and the mind.
B000005GYI|5.0|Ok, when I first picked this one up and listened to it a couple of times I was kind of dissapointed.  A couple of the Nascimento songs like &quot;Cravo E Canela&quot;, &quot;San Vicente&quot; absolutley wonderful, very infectious and addictive, but, the Lo Borges contributions didn't seem like my cup of tea.  Luckily, I kept listening.  All I've got to say is the previous reviwers are not joking! This album has grown on me in a serious way and I'm listening to it at least twice a day now.  If you've already acquired the taste for Brazillian music, don't be afraid, go ahead and treat yourself, you won't be dissapointed.  If you're just now getting into brazillian music (this is THE first Nascimento album to buy), go ahead and give it a chance, you will find a song or 3 that you like right off the bat, keep listening, and before long you'll be fanatically in love with every track on the album.  (the good thing about that is, there are plenty of diverse tracks, it might take anywhere from a few days up to a few months to really get inside it, this is one you can get your money's worth out of).  I know this one's gonna have serious staying power in my collection.  Viva Milton!
B00004W510|5.0|This is like old timey Appalachian style music, electrified, but without losing its roots feel. It's more down to earth than the almost visionary sounds of these guys' first album. On that one, it was hard for me to even talk about individual songs, so strong is the numinous presence of the album as a whole. There is still a gracious quantity of allegorical nuggets here, and ample humor as well, maybe even a bit more.<br />Their [original] version of \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" is far superior to the one made popular by Ms. Baez; and believe me, I truly love the way that young woman sang way back when.<br />\\"Whispering Pines\\" is one of the most beautiful and the most heartfelt songs you'll hear anywhere, at any time; ditto for the tremendous amount of feeling purveyed/displayed by \\"Rockin' Chair\\" and \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\".<br />\\"Across the Great Divide\\" is one of the most genuinely happy songs ever.<br />\\"When You Awake\\": \\"Ollie told me I'm a fool . . . so I walked on down the road awhile . . . went to the house that brings a smile . . . sat upon my Grandpa's knee . . . what do you think he said to me?\\"<br />Then there are the rollicking numbers: \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" where Richard Manuel absolutely wails on the piano, \\"Up On Cripple Creek\\", where Robbie Robertson manages to play his guitar to sound like a mouth bow or Jew's harp; and the intensely soulful but still humorous \\"Jemima Surrender\\". \\"Jemima surrender . . . that's all ya have to do . . . I'll bring over my Fender, and I'll play all night for you. There's a bird on my head but his mouth won't talk . . . ya know he laughs just like a bull moose, but he loves like a hawk!\\"<br />The two rockers are excellent quality: it's hard to imagine how they come up with such amazing story lyrics. \\"Look Out Cleveland\\" is emotionally upbeat, but the subject belies it, creating a dreadfully luscious ambiguity. \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" has incredible minor melodic feeling in its song line as well as in the lead guitar passages. When just playing the rhythm parts, Robertson plays it funky throughout. Textually, it's a union versus company song, but juxtaposes this with choruses each which shows the power of nature and its cycles still holding sway over the 'other' side of humankind. Nature is presenting herself somewhat outside the bounds of human culture/work, but like a fragrant, fertile ghost, forever penetrating and pervading it.<br />\\"Corn in the fields, listen to the sound as the wind blows 'cross the water:<br />King Harvest has surely come!\\"<br />\\"The scarecrow, and the yellow moon . . . pretty soon a carnival on the edge of town.<br />King Harvest has surely come!\\"<br />\\"The smell of the breeze from the magnolia trees in the meadow . . .<br />King Harvest has surely come!\\"<br />Back in 1970, when we were first becoming aware of the idea of ecology, this is what it meant.ead guitar passages.

B00005YXZH|5.0|If you look at the evolution of Wilco in terms of The Beatles (as many people, myself included, seem inclined to do) then you have to view Summerteeth as their Rubber Soul and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as their Revolver. A wondrous glowing record of uncommon passion and depth, it ranks with the true greats of the past ten years. It is great to see Tweedy &amp; Co. stretch out in the studio, and in the album's unquestioned masterpiece, Poor Places, take their songwriting to the stars and beyond. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's simple intricacies grow with each listen, and I can't think of any modern artist whose work is more essential. Now I'll just sit back and listen and anxiously await their Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />I would also add to the comments of others here - if you got the MP3s of this album that have been floating around please buy the album. Wilco truly deserves the attention, and the subtle details of the CD really flourish when they are listened to properly.
0743420373|3.0|This book was very easy to read.  The author's points seem very obvious when you think about them: to become wealthy, you need to save your money instead of spending it on frivolous things. Basically, the authors stress living below one's means in order to accumulate a decent amount of money.  This book would be helpful to anyone wondering what they can do to become wealthy, but for the most part it is just common sense.
B00005J4HH|4.0|In two words I would describe Muse as 'popular Radiohead'. Muse take one of their main influences from 'The Bends'and there is a striking resemblence to the album. The lyrics in the album are , like radiohead, deppressing, but the livelier music and the high pitch vocals from Matt make the album a bit more easier to listan to than Radioheads twisted lyrics. The band is fairly young and has definately not yet reached their peak. There is a noticable improvement on their debut album 'Showbiz', moving muse away from other influences into a far more original band. I cannot wait for their third album, as I am sure that we will be listening to a unique band, losing the resemblence of radiohead and other bands such as; the smashing pumpkins, nirvana and have I mentioned Radiohead??!<BR>the best tracks for me are; citizen erazed and plug in baby for its fantastic catchy rift<BR>ps I would like to mention that I love Radiohead, the Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana, but just want muse to move away from these influences so that we will have a 4th great band to listen to
B00005JKYS|3.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the latest film about the Vietnam War.<br />It is based on the book by Lt. Col. Hal Moore, who is portrayed quite intensely by Mel Gibson.<br />I am not a big fan of this genre, and was pretty much dragged into it by my husband.  I certainly don't feel that my time was wasted by any means.  It was very well done, and I thought some of the acting was just brilliant. Sam Elliot deserves the Oscar for his role!  He is great in this movie, and his character gets some of the best lines of the script.<br />Madeline Stowe, who I have never liked as an actress, plays Moore's wife.  Her and t.v.'s Felicity, Keri Russell, become fast friends being wives on base while the men are away at war.<br />It was just heart wrenching to watch them go to the homes of the women who had lost their Hero husbands to the elements of War.<br />It is so hard for me to review this movie, let alone recommend it. I think of going to the movies as an escape from real life. This is no escape. It is a slap in the face of the realities of the Vietnam War.  Although, this is a slap that leave a lifetime mark. Recommended to die hard fan of war movies, especially Vietnam.  I haven't read the book, but I am sure it's best to read it before seeing this.
B000062Y98|3.0|Typical from them.Better than some where far beyond,but nothing to Nightfall in Middle Earth.
B000020617|4.0|The world needs a band like the Foo Fighters.  A band that makes great music, goofy videos, and then decides to turn ultra-serious in mid-beat.  Dave Grohl is a riot, and (who knew?!) also extremely talented guitarist and vocalist.  Their previous album was amazing, it certainly took me off guard.  <br />'There is nothing left to lose' picks up where that album left off.  There are loads of distortion and overtones that swell like waves and almost drown the listener.  The band is tight, and they have some real jems here like 'Learning to Fly', 'MIA', 'Breakout', and 'Generator'.  All contain the trademark FF catchiness.  Hum away listeners!  In the end, the disc does not quite flow as well as the previous one, but it's close.<br />Recommended.
B00003CX5P|2.0|The special effects are eye-popping, and they are what get all of the 2 stars.  The acting is servicable, considering what the actors were given to work with.  Unfortunately, the rest is all bad news.  You gotta do more than just put the words \\"Star Wars\\" before the title.  You gotta have a story and you gotta know where you're going with it.  Then you gotta write words that will inspire the actors.  These all tend to hold the audience's interest, causing them to remain awake.  I think Mr. Lucas needs to leave his version of a Neverland ranch or wherever it is that he holes up between movies and rediscover just what it was that inspired him to create the full-blooded thrill-ride that was the original Star Wars.  When I first saw SW I was hooked for 2 hours.  I was IN that rocket fighter with Luke.  All I could think of when I left the theater was \\"I gotta see this AGAIN!\\"  All I could think of while watching Phantom Menace was \\"Isn't this over YET?!!\\"  In the original you were in the fight against the Empire; in Phantom Menace, you're only in a fight to not fall asleep.  Why didn't he just have every role played by Jar Jar in different costumes?  At least it would have been funny-type entertaining.
B000060P79|5.0|I would highly recommend the Simple Plan CD to everyone who enjoys a type of pop punk music. It seems to me to be one of the top three or four CD's that I own. The lyrics relate to a life of a kid and just helps everything in the world to be better... Ya so go and get it!
0471603864|5.0|OK. It seems that I am the one who criticizes all the books that everyone else loves.<BR>The book is very good as far as didactics is concerned. But have you really read it? Let me ask you a few questions:<br />How many typos can you find in chapter 9?<BR>What do you think - had ANYONE proofread Chapter 11 before the book was published?<BR>What about the exercises -can you do 9.2 without Halzen and Martin at hand (so that you may look up what, say,  7'&gt; really means? (Griffiths mixes notation from the two books and you can never solve the exercise without intoroducing some corrections).<br />There are many more questions like these to be asked about the Introduction to Elementary Particles.<BR>So, do you like the content or the lively style?<br />But, of course, five stars!
B00005R87Q|5.0|An exciting film about a group of hijackers hiding under the guise of well funded street racers, and that cop that is persuing them.  The film moves along at a high octane fast pace, and well staged stunts keeps the audience highly entertained.  I am an avid fan of the street racing scene, and found this movie highly entertaining.  Vin Diesel is excellent with the screen presence equal to any of the big name action stars. As is Paul Walker as the well toned, good looking undercover cop.  I hope to see both again very soon in Fast and the Furious 2.  For added fun compare this film to another guilty pleasure of mine Point Break, and watch the similarities unfold.  Make a day of it.  Don't try to overthink the film.  Just enjoy its turbo-charged, giggle gased, thumping stereo escapism that it is. Enjoy!!
0345448898|5.0|All three books are excellent. You don't want the books to end.
B000060MY6|2.0|This film did have all of your Lynch-isms, and I am a fan of Lynch, but it did not hit home for me. One of the funnest things about Lynch is watching the movies again and figuring them out. I got it for the most part, but honestly I didn't care to give it another veiw even for the sake of proving I could understand everything. I really had high hopes for this movie, but I'm not gonna like it just because its Lynch. If he does another movie with the double-life/doppelganger/dream-realtiy theme its gonna really start to wear thin.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is wonderful music, beautifully recorded and performed (especially in the vocals), but it's the songwriting on &quot;Love &amp; Theft&quot; that blows me away.  Does anybody else write like this?  Can anyone else?  These are songs &amp; characters to get lost in.  &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; won the Grammy and is a great rock record, but THIS is the Dylan masterpiece I didn't think he could still create.
0553573403|5.0|Sometimes you read so many books that you consider to be good that you forget the feeling that overwhelms you when you read one that is truly wonderful. And then, when you find a wonderful one, you wonder what makes it so, what sets it apart from those that are just &quot;good.&quot; I wasn't more than fifty or so pages into *A Game of Thrones* when I started wondering that very thing.<br />And then I got to a certain chapter and fully realized why. In this case there are so many components. The most important one, however, is that it makes you feel. Strongly. I was reading the aforementioned chapter and it occurred to me that my stomach was tense, that I was grinding my teeth, that I hated a character so passionately that I could physically feel it. That this novel had roused such an emotion, well, suffice it to say, I hadn't felt that for quite some time with the novels I had been reading. I loved it.<br />The next component is one of equal importance. Martin is admirably adept at handling language. His prose is beautiful and evocative and always right on. This novel is one even a discriminating &quot;literary&quot; reader could pick up and find him or herself awed by.<br />So many times I found myself almost unwilling to go on with my reading. I was afraid to find out what was going to happen next. Nothing is as it should be or even how you imagine it could be. And yet it is completely unimaginable to stop. I just had to know what was going to happen next.<br />I have to say, I had been disappointed by some of the fantasy recommended on this site before, but this one makes up for them all.
1587990717|1.0|The book could have been better written if there had been a topic.  The title is attractive enough for me to open the cover, but the contents are loosely connected with repetition.  Lack of detailed rigorous proof is also the weakness although the author claims to be otherwise.  If you are sitting on the beach in Bali, you might want to pick this up.  For me, I rather spend my time with something more worthwhile.
B0000019PA|5.0|I first heard this record in the fall of 1998, and almost four years later, I still never get tired of it. There is no other recording that makes me feel the way this one does. It deals with the idea that people can be annihilated by a powerful enough pain or beauty, but that some perfect remnant of them will survive no matter what. &quot;One day in New York City baby a girl fell from the sky / from the top of a burning apartment building fourteen stories high / and when her spirit left her body how it split the sun / I know that she will live forever all goes on and on...&quot; It's a very metaphysical view of life, but I find it breathtaking and restorative. The songs explore this philosophy not only in the lyrics but in the cathartic energy and abandon of the music itself. I wouldn't expect everyone to get it, but for those that will, this is an experience you shouldn't miss.
B000002KKC|5.0|This is easily Fleetwood Mac's best album and a welcome addition to any collection.  That said, this album requires some &quot;work&quot; to adjust to.  It's not what one would expect from the Mac, and is filled with quirky songs and challenging arrangements.  Stevie Nicks delivers one of her best collections of songs here.  &quot;Sara&quot; remains a pop masterpiece of complex music and arrangement.  It's tragic that Warners still hasn't remastered this disc to include the entire song.  The best song here (and Stevie's best ever) is &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;, a simple, plaintive ballad that builds in delicacy to a call-and-response conclusion that is simply stunning.  While &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; seems overly familiar now, due to the recurring themes of Stevie's later songs, it's still a stunner of a song.  Christine McVie supplies her dependable songs and stylings, the best of which are &quot;Think About Me&quot; and the gourgeous &quot;Over and Over&quot;.  While Lindsey Buckingham could certainly afford to lose a few of his songs (&quot;That's All For Everyone&quot; and &quot;Save Me a Place&quot; just have to go) he has some definitely interesting work here.  &quot;The Ledge&quot; is a quick, jolting wonder, and &quot;Not That Funny&quot; is both an odd and riveting punkish rave-up.  Of course, the song &quot;Tusk&quot; is one of the most unusual pop songs in the history of music (it reached #8 on the charts) and is alone worth the price of admission.  Overall, the arrangements are original and intricate.  You sit there wondering how this bunch ever thought up this stuff.  Go get &quot;Tusk&quot;.  You'll get years of pleasure out of it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I give this CD 6 stars. Everyone should run out and buy her CD so she can get rich off her beautiful voice.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|The two stars all go to Angelina Jolie. She was the one bright spot in this otherwise pedestrian and disappointing flick. Somehow the casting director managed to make this one inspired choice and find the actress who was the perfect Lara Croft.<br />Unfortunately, the scriptwriter and film director then proceeded to blow their chance. Sure, Tomb Raider was never going to be Great Art, but the saddest part of this movie was that it HAD all the elements, but somehow nothing quite came together. We had characters that SOUNDED like they would be interesting... but we don't learn enough about them to care. We had scenes that COULD have been tense and exciting... but somehow, they failed. It's really hard to understand how you can have a Gorgeous Babe(TM) in a scene with lots of Special Effects and Butt-Kicking (TM) and fail to get the adrenalin pumping, but somehow they succeeded in doing just that several times. It's almost tragic, in a way. Every scene, every concept, was just THIS >&lt; far from working, but missing by that tiny bit was enough to kill it.<br /> I hear there's supposed to be a sequel; maybe, somehow, they'll figure out where they went wrong. It'd be nice, since as I said Angelina Jolie is a perfect Lara Croft, but I'm not holding my breath.
B000002UAF|5.0|By the spring of 1964, the Beatles had become the biggest pop-culture phenomenon since Elvis. With hindsight, we can see this as a pivotal point in the band's career. There were plenty of distractions, the making of the movie being one of them. Would they be able to focus enough on the music, or would they hope that their fame would help them carry the day? The Beatles responded by making an almost perfect pop record; one which would serve as a blue print for many pop records to follow.<br />First, there are the songs, which were all written by Lennon and McCartney. There are the obvious classics, like the title track, &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, and &quot;If I Fell&quot;. But what makes this album so special is that there is absolutely no filler. &quot;I Should Have Know Better&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;, &quot;When I Get Home&quot;, &quot;You Can't Do That&quot;,and &quot;I'll Be Back&quot; would have been stand-out tracks on any album made by any other band on the planet. Even the less innovative tracks, such as &quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance With You&quot; have a great deal of energy.<br />Speaking of energy, the performances are all first-rate. This is an indication that the Beatles were able to respond posititvely when they were under great pressure to produce. Also, there are nice instrumental touches, such as George Martin on piano doubling the guitar solo on the title track, or the arrangement on &quot;And I Love Her&quot;. The vocals are all first-rate also, the harmonies on &quot;If I Fell&quot; being practically legendary.<br />All in all, this was the Beatles' first masterpiece and the high point of the Beatlemania era. Absolutely essential.
0192833669|4.0|What exactly gives a novel, written by a twenty-year-old European girl from the Victorian era, the wings of literary longevity needed to carry it across two centuries and the Atlantic Ocean?  How has it been able to propagate itself across contemporary American Culture in such a way that it can be found on any given day everywhere from cartoons-that big orange thing with tennis shoes chasing bugs bunny through a castle-to upper division university literature seminars?  Well, it IS a monster story, but that doesn't explain it.  It is pretty well written, for having a young author, but only in the Romantic tradition, with all of the attendant thickly written melodrama and blubbery prose-think Anne Rice without the Prozac or sex.  So Shelley's literary talents don't really explain it either.  It does sort of begin the mad-scientist routine that we `modern' folks love so much, which picked up some real momentum with the publication of Stevenson's `Jekyll and Hyde'.  I suspect that partially accounts for some of its continuing appeal to the adult reader and movie-goer.  Shelley did spend a great deal of energy ruminating on the possible moral and ethical implications of messing around with the natural order of things.  She let the good doctor cross that line and mess around with some taboo stuff, the defeat of death and all of that.  And her commentary on the matter is clear:  good old-fashioned Romantic fear.  The monster really lets him have it.  I won't go into it, I don't want to give away any of the story.  Now we're beginning to understand some of its appeal, but even a decent monster story and fore-shadowing of the human-cloning debate don't entirely account for the fact that there will surely be at least one kid who, with stitches painted on his green face and mock bolts sticking from the sides of his neck, will lurch up to my doorstep October 31st and holler `Trick or Treat' in monsterspeak.  Here's where I need to get a bit more serious with my analysis, because I suspect that Frankenstein is one of just a few texts that is actually important, because it was instrumental in helping literature-an as expository art form-climb to the next level.  The Victorian era was a landscape of chaos-think Industrial and French revolutions-from which a most unsightly, energetic, and important monster lurched to life and strode across Europe like a colossus.  No, not Frankenstein's monster, I'm talking about Freud.  Intellectuals of the day had wonderful avenues of speculation to discuss over coffee.  All kinds of new things were going on and it is no wonder that, from that great mixing of intellectual nutrients-the Victorian petri-dish of ideas and ideals-we get Mary Shelley's gem.  It combines, in ambitious literary metaphor, Freud's ideas of the ego, id, and unconscious-Frank, his creation, and the `desert mountains and deep, glacial ravines'-with concerns over science, and all the while paying homage to the backdrop of Christianity that lay under Europe like the mantle of the Earth-a creator who despises his creation, who, in turn, loves and hates his creator.  It's wonderful stuff.  The Victorian century, with all that was going on, was just ripe for this kind of mixed speculation and commentary, and we are the lucky inheritors of the fruits of that chaotic time.  Frankenstein, because of its depth of conscience, and the breadth of its ambitious, allegorical commentary, will undoubtedly be around for quite some time.  I urge prospective readers to set aside their previous ideas about the story, their visions of lurching monsters-I always get the tennis-shoed, orange hairball or the blockhead in Young Frankenstein howling `Fire Bad!'-and take the time to read the story from a fresh perspective.  It's well worth it.e I suspect that Frankenstein is one of just a few texts that is actually important, because it was instrumental in helping literature-an as expository art form-climb to the next level.  The Victorian era was a landscape of chaos-think Industrial and French revolutions-from which a most unsightly, energetic, and important monster lurched to life and strode across Europe like a colossus.

630460288X|5.0|Ok, where do I start.  Before I rented this movie, I wasnt expecting much as it had a selvester stallone and snipes.  However, when I watched it, I was dumbfounded.  This isnt at all like any of stallone's cheesy action flicks or like the incredibly stupid &quot;Blade&quot; with snipes, this was by far one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever watched, closely rivaling &quot;the matrix&quot;.  Stallone is still a little wooden as far as his acting goes but I think he fits the part well, and Snipes, in my opinion is exelent in this one.  The main reason i liked this movie so much is the plot.  The plot is so fun, thought-provoking and original, I would have seen the movie just for the idea.  If you havnt seen this movie, see it now! if you have seen it, see it again! if you dont own it, buy it! you wont regret it!
B00005YXZH|1.0|Every time I hear the claim that a CD is new and ground breaking I normally find it sounds like a slightly modern version of The Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. This CD is no exception. There's really nothing new about this album, everything they do is recycled from ambient music and Radiohead. But maybe my biggest complaint is that Tweedy is not a strong vocalist and his flat delivery kills any life this CD may have had.
B00005YXZH|5.0|#1 ) This album is fantastic.  I am a huge classic rock / blues / jazz fan, and this album probably doesn't fit into any one of those categories necessarily, however, i surely wouldn't consider it alt-country -- wilco is expanding the boundries.  Also, the album flows like nothing i've heard since Ok Computer...and it's very passionate as well...quite personal.  I really like some of the tones they get on track 4...also,the album is best heard as 1 entity...trust me on this one.<br />#2 ) A few reviews that I read indicated people saying that the CD is better than the mp3 version...I'm definately not trying to encourage pirating here, in fact, I even bought this album.  From listening to both versions: cd audio, and mp3(192 bitrate), i can definately tell you there is very little, if any, noticible difference.  This is also true with any mp3/cd.  <br />So don't buy a CD for quality, buy it to support the band, or even better, do what I do : send the band money directly as payment for all the songs you have gotten &quot;backup&quot; copies of.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I am a large fan of John Williams and Harry Potter, and I loved both the movie and the music to the background.  It gives a magical aura that could only belong to that 11-year old wizard.  However, I found that the whole of the soundtrack was not as full or pleasing as it could be, perhaps as the Lord of the Rings soundtrack was.  Nevertheless, this is another triumph for John Williams and should be bought by fans of John, Harry, or anyone just looking for some great music to listen to.
0780624890|1.0|What can I say? this movie is one of the most horrible I have ever watched, I wish I could have given it -5 stars, and its not even worth it to say why I hate it.
B000001DTM|5.0|this is definitely one of the best rock albums ever made. it is disputably better than their previous album &quot;joshua tree.&quot; it has had acclaim on many nation 100 top albums of all time. and is rated on many musical web-sites as a &quot;must have album.&quot; it is a great album with no weak songs. and the reason it is one of the greatest is that all the songs seem to flow in orderly and organized fashion to the end.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This is one of those rare films that brings you right back into the 1970's. I was just a kid in that decade, but I saw older kids and younger adults who looked and talked like some of the characters in this film, so the *feel* of the '70's just came back to me as I watched. The excitement, the decadence, the long hair and beards, the earth shoes, and the great rock 'n' roll music that was as thick in the air as the smoke; it was all there in front of me, but somehow most of it eluded me. As a member of 'Generation X', I missed out on all that fun--but also all the excess, the drugs, and the social sicknesses that defined the 'Me Decade'.<br />This film has all of the above, but this is not merely a time warp.  It tells the story of how a repressed, yearning young boy became inspired to become a rock 'n' roll writer--at the tender age of 15 years old. It made me wish that I had pursued my dreams at that age! Based on writer-director Cameron Crowe's own life, the story of the adventures of young William Miller (played to innocent man-child perfection by Patrick Fugit), as he follows the fictional hard-rock band Stillwater during their romps with groupies, prostitutes, and assorted druggies, held my attention from beginning to end. It made me realize that my life may not have been all fun-and-games even if I HAD pursued my dreams in my teens!<br />The reason why ALMOST FAMOUS is so wonderful? Let's begin with the excellent, and informative, writing from the pen of Cameron Crowe, who saw it all at such a tender young age. Let's continue on with the well-fleshed-out characters, who are so real and yet always seem to have that magical way of revealing something about themselves in nearly everything they say. Let's conclude with the always-compelling story, which has many twists and turns, yet never feels contrived.<br />All in all, this film has it all.  Besides the brilliant low-key starring debut of Patrick Fugit, we have a wonderful, fully-realized performance from Billy Crudup (one of the best actors of his generation; look for his first Oscar within the next three years) as \\"golden god\\" lead guitarist Russell Hammond, who perhaps single-handedly personifies the various changes, and the vices, of the '70's.  Also impressive is the realistic performance of egotistical lead singer Jeff Bebe by Jason Lee.  Of course, no review of ALMOST FAMOUS would be complete without mentioning the star-making performance of Goldie Hawn's beautiful progeny, Kate Hudson, in an extremely well-realized performance as the ultimate rock groupie, Penny Lane.  If you love a great story being told in an incisive, intelligent way with love for its characters who are completely real, then please buy this DVD.  This was one of the five best films of 2000.  MOST RECOMMENDED
0064430227|5.0|This is a true classic in my mind. The story is timeless. The reading is easy and the story is cute. My children enjoy the story of the young boy who draws everything he needs with his purple crayon. The lesson about imagination is easy to grasp with this story.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I really hate to see so many \\"supposed\\" No Doubt fans slamming this CD.  Sure, I will grant you, it is very different than their previous works, but do you really want to see the band get \\"trapped in a box?\\"  I, for one, do not.  In my opinion, No Doubt has always provided quite a mix of styles on their albums and I have always enjoyed that.  They are not afraid to try something new.  You need to have an open mind.  I like the CD a little more every time I listen to it.  It makes me feel good.   The music is uplifting and fun.  It is refreshing to listen to something light for a change.  Much of the music today is dark and depressing.  This is not.  If you love No Doubt's older work, then just pop in one of their old CD's and listen to it.  Don't criticize them for trying something different.  Let them grow.  That's my two-cents worth.
0451204530|3.0|I really think Ken Follett is losing it.  The last book of his that I read, &quot;Night Over Water&quot;, had cartoon characters as its principal actors and a plot straight out of an old WWII movie - although I had to admit he did his research.<br />The problem is magnified here, with &quot;Code to Zero&quot;.  Again, Follett has done his research, there's no denying that - but this novel is just about as bad as &quot;Night Over Water&quot;.  The story starts out very well, and held my interest for quite a while.  A man wakes up in a corner of Union Station in 1950's Washington DC, with no knowledge of how he got there - or of anything else before that moment.  He's dressed like a bum, but his thoughts, instincts, and actions contradict that first impression.  He sets out to discover who he is and how he got to Union Station, and therein lies Follett's tale.<br />But the initial interest I had in the story soon disintegrated when I discovered that &quot;Code&quot; was really nothing more than a potboiler spy story, something I thought Follett was incapable of writing until now.  Basically this turned out to be a story of the heroic United States against the godless Communists, and while this does have some kind of weird but logical resonance after the events of September 11, this type of story has been done before - and much better (Arnaud DeBorchgrave's &quot;The Spike&quot; springs immediately to mind).<br />Follett has a new novel out in hardcover, and I'll reserve it at my local library.  I'm willing to give him another chance - but my patience is wearing thin.
B00004U8JU|5.0|Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster is still the best of the Jurassic trilogy, and the film retains all the amazement and anticipation it had when it was first released. After the critical and commercial failures of Always and Hook, Spielberg returns to form with one of the most astounding adventure films ever made.<br />Spielberg's dinosaur adventure is not his best film but it's up there with the all-time greats. Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made. The special effects are from FX maestro Stan Winston, who did the special effects for Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 (1991). The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set- pieces.<br />Despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. But admittedly, the special effects are the main attraction, and Winston's dinosaurs (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightening. Great entertainment.<br />The film's transfer onto DVD is first- rate, with superb picture and sound. The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film and trailers for Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the teaser for Jurassic Park 3. Most interesting, however, is the footage of early pre-production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done. Also, there's a Phil Tippett animatic &quot;Raptors in the Kitchen&quot;, showing how claymation assists the director in visualising the shots and camera angles. Also there are storyboards, production photos and web links. A 5 star film, 5 star extras. Excellent entertainment.
B000063DS1|5.0|walking out of the theater on a late chicago night I was completly stoned off of what I had just experienced. The Last Waltz had just been re-released in theatre's, and in being the big classic rock fan that I am I just had to see it (although, I admit that I didn't know much about the band at that time but now, thanks to the movie and box set I own all their pre-ego split records).In short I wasn't to be dissapointed. As incredible guest after incredible guest rolled out I had to slap myself a couple of times just to contain myself. But then to add to that I found out that the music was also being given the box set treatment by Rhino. <br />I've never heard the original but after completely diving into this extreme package I can't help but be grateful that I never had to buy it twice. Were the first set was good, this set is darn right awesome. I mean imagine a c.d where a live version of Neil Young singing \\"Helpless\\" (although truly great as he can only be) is not the best song. there are so many like Rick Danko's soulful singing on all his tracks but especially \\"it makes no difference\\", or the Staples included version of \\"The Weight\\" where it just seems like it was meant to be sung that way right from the beginning. Throw in a little Van Morrison or Dr. John along with every one else and you've really got somehing. Heck this set even challenges one to think a little less harsh of the other Neil:)  <br />so much great music and the sound is incredible. it is so reassuring that in this age of really so-so or just down right terrible, over-priced box sets...there are a few good ones that come along that don't make you wish you hadn't given up eating for a week or gone without electricity for a couple of days!BUY THIS SET AND YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!
B000023VR6|4.0|Well, this cd is a masterpiece of rap music. \\"Forget about Dre\\" is the best song ever 4 me... Well, there's nothing else to say... Dre speaks himself, I can't say anything more... Buy it at Amazon.com and enjoy... =]
0385484518|5.0|This book is great!  This book tells the very basic but valuable lessons such as family, emotions, money, age, cultures, forgiveness, and so on.  The lessons help you to find the meaning in the life.  Morrie teaches us how to live, to love and to be loved.  The book can be your guide in any stage of your life.  It is very good book!  I recommend to everybody.
2070360024|5.0|I'm not quite to the end of the book yet, but so far I love it.  It's the only book I've been required to read for class that I actually enjoy reading.
0061040967|5.0|This book is awesome, fabulous, funny, and gorgeous! The illustrations are as amazing as Pratchett's best writing (which, OK...Carrot in Space may not be a shining moment...). I especially love the picture of Death With Kitten, and comparing the first picture of the bard with the successive ones. The jokes are fantastic, and the problems presented are, as always, multi-universal.<br />If you've never read a Pratchett novel, this probably isnt the best one to start with, but its so pretty, you should buy it just to have it.
0385721234|4.0|Like Water For Chocolate <BR>By Laura Esquivel<BR>Doubleday Anchor Books, Random House,1995<br />What if the wicked stepmother gave Prince Charming to one of the ugly sisters? What if Cinderella was not the darling of the hearth but, through her command of the kitchen, exacted her revenge on everyone in the household? What if the ensuing drama assumed hallucinatory, Alice in Wonderlandish proportions? If anything about Cinderella lights your fire, you have to read Laura Esquivel's debut novel, Like Water for Chocolate.<BR>Like Water for Chocolate is a love story folded into the pages of a cookbook. \\"Quail in Rose Sauce\\" and similarly exotic recipes introduce each chapter of this simple domestic tale about a family's celebration of weddings, christenings, and wakes.<BR>Into the simmering cauldron of Mexican revolution at the turn of the century, Laura Esquivel ladles the key ingredients: Tita, her two sisters, and their domineering mother. When family tradition condemns Tita to remain single, she empties her despair into her love for cooking. A masterful storyteller, Equivel turns up the heat until Tita's passion reaches boiling point, like water for chocolate. Tita's true love, Pedro, and other male characters wait on the periphery, these fantastic, female characters are the feast itself in an earthy rendition of Cinderella that will leave you greedy for more. <BR>If you enjoyed Babette's Feast you will devour Like Water for Chocolate like a starving animal. The power of food can mould any occasion but the magical dishes at Tita's banquets catapult the guests into everything from food poisoning to mass orgies. A soap opera of family secrets and fiancé-stealing siblings is whisked in along with bizarre, mythological elements in a mouth-watering, tall tale that conjures up Chagall-like images: squabbling chickens that bore a hole into the earth, tears that pour down the stairs, a woman's lust that ignites a building. <BR>All is carefully baked into screenwriter Esquivel's sumptuous novel and liberally garnished with home hints for breast-feeding, curing flatulence and bad breath, and making matches.<BR>With Like Water for Chocolate, Laura Esquivel begins a tradition of playfully blending genres to create sensual, humorous concoctions that are part family history and part superstition, a tradition she continues with Between Two Fires. <BR>Like Water for Chocolate is, above all, a fairytale about star-crossed lovers whose sizzling passion is thwarted from beginning to end. Though Esquivel refuses throughout to comfort the reader with the tempting aroma of a happy ending, the twists and turns of the final chapter are as satisfying as any the romance reader will ever read.<BR>Bon Apetit!
B00004WLXZ|5.0|They stole all the ideas from here! Check it out and I dare you to disagree! Watch this movie & watch a Republican National Convention.<br />The colors are different but the techniques are the same.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This movie is horrible!  The plot, and some of the effects were totally unoriginal.  The action scenes were tolerable, but some of the combat was made needlessly complicated for the purposes of looking good.  Example: You've got a gun, and invaders are coming in, do you shoot them?  No, you start swinging from the chandeliers dodging bullets and kicking the men with guns.  What the ...?  My friend fell asleep watching this movie!  If you want good action, see movies such as Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, all James Bond's etc.  The only worse movie I think I've ever seen is....It's taking a while to think of one, so I'll just end it here.

B000001EAQ|5.0|When I first got this album I reacted the same way many U2 fans did, I only liked a couple songs and thought it was a disappointment.  However after a couple more times listening to it I really loved it.  <br />Discotheque and Mofo are terrific dance tracks.  Staring at the sun, Gone, Miami, and Last night on Earth are great rock songs.  Please, If God will send his angels, and Wake up dead man rank among some of their best moving anthems.  Do you feel loved and If you wear that velvet dress are good pop songs.  Throughout the entire album U2 goes from one side of pop music to the next.<br />It is beyond a doubt their most hated album among fans who only listen to it once and considered one of their best among those who give it another spin.
B000055XMF|3.0|I had stellar hopes for this movie, so my review will likely be biased.  I love Quadrophenia the album.  I love the story and the album and the depth.  I love the honesty and the trueness of the portrayal of the suffocating nature of adolescence.  The movie fails to capture this.<br />The movie fails to capture the second half of the album entirely, except for bits and pieces in passing.  There is a strong focus on some things, but others are entirely left out.  For instance, a trio of Jim's four personalities seem to be absent.  There is no depth to his character - he simply seems like an irritable brat, and it is only the untarnished portions of the story that give him any semblance of sympathy.<br />But if not Jim, what does the movie focus on?  There is an extremely heavy emphasis on the mod culture to which Jim almost belongs, and a fair amount of time spent on his family.  In other words, the movie focuses totally on Jim's external world.  Thus, when Jim breaks apart when the girl ditches him for his friend, it seems unrealistic and irrational, as there has been no emphasis on the buildup of tension within Jim.<br />Some might say in its defence that the film version of Quadrophenia is only a movie and cannot be expected to take care of internal dialogue and the like.  I disagree with this strongly.  It merely shows a great lack of ingenuity and creativity in the producers of this film.  Even something utterly stupid and tacky a-la the tint changes in &quot;Traffic&quot; would have been welcome in place of the avoidance of Jim's psyche.<br />As I said, the movie grazes over the second half of the album.  The love song, &quot;Sea and Sand,&quot; is missing, as is the suicidal plea of &quot;Drowned.&quot;  But that's not too surprising because they cut out the climactic uncertainty of Jim travelling to a rock in the ocean and contemplating suicide.  Also, they cut out the external climax of &quot;Dr. Jimmy&quot; and left the song relegated to the credits.<br />Any linear quality of the album was dispensed in favor of a simpler story.  In the process, almost all of the best moments got cut out.  The thing that irked me more than anything mentioned before has got to be the abandonment of &quot;Helpless Dancer.&quot;  All that song gets is a piddling out of context snippet just before the credits.  I could cry just thinking about it.<br />I'm not suggesting, however, that the whole album should have been played in the movie - I understand that the length of the album would almost constitute a movie in its own right.  I just feel that the whole story should have been represented in order, covering both internal and external aspects.  When the album gets so butchered, you're left with a watered down yet shallow [pun] movie that rightfully never made it big.  It's a shame, too, because the movie could have potentially popularized the album, had it effectively portrayed what happens in the album.<br />I only gave it as many as three stars because I don't want to drag down the average rating too much and thus influence newcomer's opinions on the concept of Quadrophenia.
006097625X|5.0|This book is outstanding, and for most readers will be unlike anything you've ever read before.  It's a comic book about the art of making comic books, but also a terrific statement on art itself, as well as the creative process.  I recommend this to anyone who's ever enjoyed a comic book, but also anyone creative or interested in the creative process.
0380973650|5.0|I've been dying to read American Gods since I saw an interview with Neil Gaiman in the local paper.  The premise of the book sounded really intriguing, and since I am a Gaiman fan from the Sandman comic series, I figured I'd give it a try.  I've been waiting desperately to get my hands on it.  Last week, I finally did.<br />Was it worth the wait?  You betcha.  This is a truly marvelous book dealing with compassion, loyalty, relationships, deities, and how one man is affected by it all.  This man is Shadow, a man who is in prison for assault.  He is ready to be released and get back to his life when he gets word that his wife has died.  He later finds out that the job he has waiting for him when he gets out is no longer there as well.  Shadow is approached by a mysterious figure, Mr. Wednesday, who knows a lot about him.  Wednesday offers Shadow a job as a driver who may have to do other \\"dangerous\\" things as well.<br />Thus begins a long journey that will span the entirety of Midwestern American.  At times, American Gods feels like a travelogue, at other times, like a road movie.  Then, there are quieter times where it is a mystery of sorts.  Some people may have trouble with the conflicting \\"styles,\\" but all of these sequences fall under the overarching theme of the novel.  As Gaiman mentions in his acknowledgements, he is attempting to \\"find America,\\" and the representation in this novel is stunning.  You really get the feel for small, middle America town living, where every town is the \\"home of\\" a semi-famous athlete or a state champion in some sport.<br />The basic concept of the book is that immigrants to the United States (or North America in general, considering one of the interludes deals with immigrants from a few thousand years ago) bring their gods with them in their minds.  Unfortunately for them, belief in them has been faltering for many years, and it's almost gone.  It's been replaced by other gods:  technology, media, Internet.  Wednesday wants to fight back by gathering together the older gods and starting a war with the new ones.  He brings Shadow along for a lot of these recruiting missions, and thus we meet some of the older gods.<br />The characters in American Gods are just wonderfully portrayed.  Even the minor characters are well-rounded and three dimensional.  My favourites have to be Ibis and Jacquel, two characters that Shadow meets in Cairo, Illinois.  They're undertakers, but they offer him a unique perspective on this whole thing.  Then there are some Native American gods who are also quite interesting.<br />Curiously enough, the most under-developed character throughout the book is Shadow himself.  You don't find out a lot about him until the end of the book.  You get snippets of information, but most of things you find out about him are through his actions in the book.  You see a compassion that's hidden beneath the tough exterior.  You see a loyalty to his friends, a sense of honour that even death can't destroy.  I find him the most interesting character in the book, which is good because he's the central character.<br />For me, there really isn't a flaw in this book.  I've seen reviews that complain about the interludes or the sequence of events in Lakeside (a small town in Wisconsin), and how they don't \\"have much to do with the plot of the book.\\"  I think that's missing the point.  The book is more than the war of the gods.  It's about finding values.  It's about moving beyond beliefs.  It's about one man and how he reacts to these things.  I think the Lakeside sequence is actually the core of the book to some extent.  The ending of the war is a bit anti-climactic, but I didn't mind that for the same reasons.<br />If you have any interest in mythology, run out and get this book.  Even if you don't have an interest, I think you'll still value the experience.ight back by gathering together the older gods and starting a war with the new ones.

B00005YXZH|3.0|Beyond all this album's snowball hoopla, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an 11-song album with at least four clunkers and production throughout that only seems revolutionary thanks to all the digital pop out there. This album holds nothing on the Sergeant Peppers of the world, which is not a dig. The songs here aren't that good.<br />The first problem is lyrics, most of which run disassociative junior high poetry diary lines past each other to no effect, besides cringing: I am an American aquarium drinker; Jesus don't cry you can rely on me honey; all my lies are only wishes. The album is too much a first-person cutesy-poo mess. The arrangements--heavy on dirge pace and long length--add to the pomp. I Am Trying To Break Your Heart says its peace at four minutes but goes on for three slow-tempoed more, with Tweedy reshouting throwaway lines like &quot;disposable dixie cup drinker.&quot;<BR>&quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; does the same with bad lines like the aforementioned &quot;lies-wishes&quot; silliness and references to &quot;diet coca-cola and unleaded cigarettes&quot; before somehow ending up at Tweedy saying more than singing &quot;I would like to salute the ashes of American flags.&quot; Right. It might be fun if a nuttier singer or band took such weird turns with faster, less self-serious songs, but with a calculated front man like Tweedy, and crawl tempos, it too often comes off as a bar band going too far down the avant guard road. Then all of this gets thrown off by bad, banal stuff like I'm the Man Who Loves You (sloppy white funk) and Heavy Metal Drummer (Wilco foray into Barenaked Ladies-type comedy modern rock), and you got a really unbalanced album insanely overhyped and having its good songs and points outweighed by bad ones.<br />Bright spots: I Am Trying To Break Your Heart is good for those first four minutes despite the bad lyrics. The arrangement builds for that time, then just breaks apart into repetition and noise. Kamera and War on War are fun pop strummers, low-key stuff with nice melodic accents in the form of computer-generated bells and whistles. Radio Cure is a moody, pretty cross of Richard Buckner guitar flourishes and Idaho beating-heart drums. Jesus Etc is beautiful and strange despite the bad lyrics. The arrangement of Ashes of American Flags changes in its recorded sound twice to cool effect, going from layered studio stuff to an almost live sound. And the album closes with Reservations, a beautiful piano ballad with the album's most direct (and best) lyrics: I've got reservations about so many things, but not about you.<br />I'm a big fan of Wilco and Tweedy's songwriting and not at all a stubborn-hearted alt-country stalwart who can't stomach stylistic changes, but I do weigh songs over identity-changing and album-concept conceits, and here is where this album failed for me. This is the kind of album everyone who reviews or reads reviews slobbers all over upon release, then puts away for good in two months.

Very motivating, practical approach to incredible information about oneself that is eye opening and inspirational. Enjoyed every minute of it.

B00005JKES|5.0|If you buy the first season make sure you have the TV Pilot and the movie Fire Walk With Me, and make sure you absolutely have the book \\"The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer\\" By Jennifer Lynch.   The Book puts everything together and makes the movie make sense.   There is alot of stuff going on and it will help you understand alot of the weird things that go on in the movie and in the first season.<br />For all of you who have never seen Twin Peaks you don't know what you are missing.   It's great cause you can't watch it just once everytime you watch it you pick up something new.   The cleverest thing I've ever watched in my 30 years.

B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride's \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is outstanding! She puts her 110% effort in it. My favorite tracks are: # 3 \\"Independence Day,\\" the hit of her career, a very patriotic song, #4 \\"Strangers,\\" a very poignant ballad well sung, #5 \\"Safe in the Arms of Love,\\" one of the best sounding single records out there and other songs such \\"Wild Angels,\\" \\"A Broken Wing,\\" \\"Valentine,\\" \\"My Baby loves me,\\" \\"Happy Girl\\" and \\"Wrong Again\\" are amazing. In her \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection, Martina also includes four more soon to be hits including \\"When God-Fearin' Women get the Blues,\\" which is hilarious, an uptempo hit featuring nice instrumentals, fiddle, dobro and banjo. Another breathtaking new hit of Martina's is \\"Where Would You Be,\\" which is a very strong vocal performance and Martina blows you away with it. \\"Concrete Angel\\" is a very sad song about child abuse and it makes you want to be there and help the young girl out. <br />\\"Blessed\\" is also an elated song, which reflects Martina's life being \\"blessed.\\" She includes all sorts of emotions in this album: humor, love, heart breaks, sadness, pity and patriotism. I basically love the entire album, but if I were to make one improvement I would add her hit \\"It's My Time,\\" in this collection, but I guess since it already has 18 songs, it would be a little over packed. Besides that it is excellent. This album is truly worth every single penny! A must have for any country music fan! Way to go Martina!!!

B0000640VO|5.0|Audrey Tautou is absolutely delightful in the title role.  She will charm you completely.  The film itself is wonderful in every respect:  writing, directing, acting.  This film takes you to the Paris of your dreams and gives you a heroine worthy of your attention.  CHARMING!  I can think of only one really charming American film in the last 20 years (Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You) and yet the French give us one every couple of years.  If you love Amelie, take a look at Autumn Tale as well.
038533558X|5.0|If you enjoyed Harlan Coben's last book, &quot;Tell No One,&quot; you will find his new book to be better, or at least an equal.<br />In Gone For Good, Coben again relies on a large cast of characters and tricky plot twists to keep you guessing the outcome right up until the end.<br />Unlike &quot;Tell No One,&quot; Coben has taken away some of the technological goodies and has written a much more mystery-solving style of thriller and it noticeably helps keep the suspense up without forcing you to slighty suspend your belief.<br />His characters are also more intriguing and well-rounded this time.  You get to know more about them and they play a much more integral role in the book.<br />I don't want to ruin the suprises so I'll end my review here.<br />Highly Recommended
B000062XKL|5.0|THE SCORE is a Mission Impossible with some dandy twists. Let's look at the music, first. It was right on the money, mood music, soft, jazzy; fitting the action to a \\"T.\\"  Next, that historical Montreal was an ideal location for a heist frame of mind. I'm partial to \\"mission\\" movies. This film, however, gave me more than the mission; a vibrancy between De Niro, Norton, and that walrus, Brando.  De Niro was a safecracker belief.  Brando glued the suspense together. As to Edward Norton, he takes the stage; a real electrical performance as the \\"inside man.\\"  Where did this chap come from?  He was sensational. This movie explained the meaning of serendipithy.  I looked for action and got a bundle of music, location, top-line actting, suspenseful plot, and best-of-the-line directing.  That's beau, bon, pas cher whether you're in Montreal or down in the states: a bargain.
B0000636UN|5.0|This album is definetely Sheryl's best, no matter what anybody else says. It's actually more entertaining, fun, and sunny, and a little bit more rock than personally I think, the boring, dark, and gloomy GLOBE SESSIONS, the dark but craveful SHERYL CROW, and the fun, mid-light and mid-dark, debut, TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB. Here is my grading sheet<br />STEVE MCQUEEN - A very pop/rock song that's a -VERY- good opener.<BR>A+<br />SOAK UP THE SUN - The first single, and one of the most sunniest, along with SM. It grew on me! A+<br />YOU'RE AN ORIGINAL - With Lenny Kravitz, sunny, I know, but haven't really you know gotten into it/listened to it yet. A<br />SAFE AND SOUND - The studio version is better than the live version...A+<br />C'MON C'MON - A very coo song A+ (The coo was made intentionally)<br />IT'S SO EASY - Not the best, but the best part about it is that it is so short! A<br />OVER YOU - I really like it and really like long songs! A+<br />LUCKY KID - One of my favorites...\\"WASTED!\\" Lol! A+<br />DIAMOND ROAD  - Very sweet and is also one of my favorites A+<br />IT'S ONLY LOVE - I don't really know if I like it or not! A-<br />ABILENE - Good. A<br />HOLE IN MY POCKET - Haven't listened to it yet.<br />WEATHER CHANNEL - Haven't listened to it yet.<br />- I'll have an update later with new ratings and my ratings for HIMP and WC.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is definately the best I have heard from any band or group. It is rock, but not so hard that your house shakes when you listen to it. And it is also a fantastic album for a teen to have because it has no profanity. It is entirely clean, so parents should be glad to let their kids hear it. Listening to Linkin Park can help ease the mind and allow teens to vent their anger in a non-violent way. Just listening to the beats and the lyrics gives people the hope that their problems will eventually go away. I recommend this very highly. It was the #1 selling record of 2001, and it should remain that way for 2002 as well.
B00001ODHJ|2.0|*<br />Just as hardcore fans of ''The Evil Dead'' were expecting ''Evil Dead II'' to continue in the same vein as the original film, so was I likewise expecting the so-called ''third'' installment ot the ''Evil Dead'' series, ''Army of Darkness,'' to follow along in the same manner of the film it's patterned after as a sequel. Unfortunately, just as ''ED2'' was a sharp departure from the first ''Evil Dead'' movie, so too was ''Army'' a major departure from ''ED2'' ...even more so.<br />Instead of being a ''cool'' and ''fun'' kind of 'silly & goofy' like its predecessor, ''Army of Darkness'' was a ''disappointing'' and ''stupid'' kind of 'silly & goofy.' Over-saturated and over-the-top, ''Army'' failed to capture the essence of ''ED2.'' The marriage of horror and humor as used in ''ED2'' actually worked; ''Army,'' on the other hand, just goes far out of its way to become nothing other than a live-action cartoon with a horror theme -- ''The EVIL Dead'' have deteriorated into ''The Dead Stooges'' (literally AND figuratively).<br />Although there were a few shining moments worthy of note-- such as Ash's ''boomstick''/''S-Mart'' monologue, his pithy comeback of ''Good? Bad? I'm the guy with the gun!'' to his sinister Deadite double, and the film's epilogue (either the original ending, which actually works better for this film, or the re-shot, 'action sequence' sell-out ending) --''Army of Darkness'' is little more than an endless run of costumed, puppeteered and stop-motion skeleton battles, the  effects of which are sometimes just awesome and other times just cheesy and hokey.<br />There is no real element of horror to be had here, and it lacks the creativity and imagination of the earlier ''Evil Dead'' films. It starts out almost half-way plausibly, right up to Ash's closing remarks in his post-pit scene monologue ... after that, it's all downhill.<br />''Army of Darkness'' is a brave and ambitious film project which could have actually worked much better as something else entirely all its own, but as a continuation of the ''Evil Dead II'' storyline it fails miserably.<br />Rent before deciding to purchase outright.ng else entirely all its own, but as a continuation of the ''Evil Dead II'' storyline it fails miserably. <br />Rent before deciding to purchase outright.

B00005Y228|5.0|There is no one like Kylie Minogue. She's been around for over 14 years, sold over 32 million records worldwide, scored over 28 Top 20 UK singles, 2 US Top 10 singles, and 2 US Top 40 singles. She remains one of the world's leading touring acts, and comes across as the girl next door. Sexy, sweet, and incredibly dance-able, \\"Fever\\" is the best dance music release of 2002. Tracks like \\"Love at first sight\\", \\"Cant get you out of my head\\", \\"In your eyes\\", \\"Give it to me\\", and \\"Burning up\\" are destined for radio airplay. The days of teenage Pop princesses who cant write their own material are over. Kylie Minogue may never have the vocal power of Celine or Mariah, but she can write her own hits, and take a chance her Diva sisters wouldnt dare of. If the rumours are true, and she DOES tour the United States with Cher in late 2002, we will finally have the MUST SEE concert of our lives.  And if that rumour never turns out to be true, we still have a huge back catalogue of Minogue hits to keep us content.

B00005YXZH|1.0|Short and sweet - don't buy this CD. I was expecting somewhat better than Summer Teeth, which I thought deserved one of the best albums of 1999. I kept anticipating a song that had some melody, words that meant something. Instead I got cutsy noises and totally &quot;me&quot; lyrics, most of the time making no sense whatsoever. Oh, please.
B00005AQF7|5.0|A masterwerk from the LBC, as all y'all have noted, and if you diasagree, well then you's a flea.  Doggystyle rides low over oily streets, those filled with the scent of the organic insanitic, big green bottles of sloe juice and wimens of unscupelatude.  Dre's production hypnotizes, a smooth groove with the usual bad attitude banter.  Even the fabulous Dramatics appear from somewhere deep in the Carolina woods.  Look fools, the Dogg Pound rules.  You better recognize.
B000002KIE|1.0|I first heard this about 20 years ago, and I immediately recognized it as contrived and lame.  I had exactly the opposite reaction when I first heard the Clash, Ramones, VU, and Stooges.  Those bands made authentic music.
038533558X|5.0|GONE FOR GOOD<BR>Review by Joe P., Providence, Rhode Island, USA<br />Remember the roller coasters of the 50s and 60s of the last century?  How you saw the scary thing coming, and were ready for it?  At least, until it got to the scary thing?  That's the ride you get with Coben's Mystery/Thriller Gone for Good.  The delightful thing is that Coben has scary, scary characters and situations; but they do not reach the way-over-the-top, somewhat gratuitous bleeding of, say, the Prey novels.<BR>You care about even his villains!  Coben is such a master at characterization that even his blackest villain's heart does not go into a stereotype Snidely-Whiplash-character; even his villains have a human dimension.  Even more, he makes that human dimension so plausible, we believe it: No matter if we would not believe this character's humanity in real life.  That is the fun of writing and reading fiction.  As Coben says in his Acknowledgments, \\"To repeat: this is a work of fiction. That means I make stuff up.\\"  That is why writers of fiction love their craft, and that is the main attribute that readers of novels have in common:  They want a story. They want it to be like reality, but they don't want it to turn out so predictable to be journalism.  They want a new twist, or what could be.<BR>Readers also demand that plots stick to self-interiorized fictional rules.  Coben's plots and subplots are numerous, and he handles them like Harold Robbins or Charles Dickens. Each short chapter leads up to a mini-black moment that forces you to turn the page, until you finish this novel, this rollercoaster ride.  Every plausible answer to the mystery is presented throughout the book; until the hero puts together the correct one, and it keeps you guessing to, yes, the very last page!  You may even shed a sudden tear at Coben's artful portrayal of the human condition.<BR>This should be the \\"beach read\\" for 2002.  Wonderful fun!  A great read!  Edgy, yet not too disturbing to kill the entertainment value! I recommend this novel as I would a Jack Higgins' or any top mystery or Burnett's High Sierra.  This novel may well garner enough praise to become a cornerstone of the genre in the 21st century.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just got from seeing a special screening of Spider-man.  And I must say it surpassed all of my expectations.  This movie is the best comic book movie in years, possibly ever.  The joy of seeing Peter swing for the first time is only beat seeing memorable scenes relived in front of your eyes.  Please, get to a movie theater as soon as you can, cause you'll just want as much time as you can to see it over and over again.
B00005MP58|5.0|Comparing the original DVD with the Special Edition, we see<br />1) That the show was originally shot for the BBC at about 1.78, NOT the 2.35 that the box says.  As a result, those of us in the U.S. who watched it on A&E, and who bought the first DVD release (OR:  original release) saw a Pan and Scan version of it.  Not by much, grant you, but enough.  By flipping back and forth between both versions of the DVD, you can see that the frame on the OR is a little crowded, parts of people are cropped off, etc.  You get the full image, as intended to be seen, with the SE.<br />2)The image quality of the OR was lousy!  Artifacts everywhere ... looked like a bad video tape.  The SE produces a much higher resolution image.  Still not as good as we would like, but better than any other incarnation of P&P on home video.  But...<br />3) That image is a little washed out.  Luckily, all you have to do is turn up the color (on my Panasonic, the color is usually set at 18.  Doubling that brought nice, rich colors), and you get a very nice image.<br />I love the SE.
B00004YA12|5.0|the movie IS a SERIOUS push - my family being Jewish and punished in concentration camps - still in this pic I feel it's serious negative strength. Try to get in your grandpa's shoes in 1930's when in central Europe - nearly no electricity, working at their fields or in the factories - and what you get is a persuasive documment that can convert even a present-time undecided may-be-undecided-antisemite to the side of the \\"dark power\\". The only thing you can be sure about is - Leni R. is definitely genious at her speciality. And - great thanx to \\"Synapse Films\\" - this is the 1st time I could view this historical documment of incredible value. And - thaaaaaanx to AMAzon.COM, too  :-)

0792841344|3.0|Believe it or not, I purchased this movie because I had heard for so very long that it is one of the classics. After watching it for the first time a couple of days ago, I agree it is a fine film and can see how it stood up over time. What I thought was going to be a lame letdown quickly became a fine piece of filmwork, easily set apart in the genre. BUT, as I mention earlier, I watched it for the first time only a couple of days ago. The entire story is given away in the first three minutes by Angus \\"The Tall Man\\" Scrimm's introduction. Otherwise, a fun film and a great addition to the collection.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I saw Spider-Man last night at a sneak preview sponsored by a famous food company.  As a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I was very pleased with Sam Raimi's faithful interpretation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's character, and his world.  The writing couldn't have captured the spirit of the comic any better, and the casting was truly inspired.  Unlike so many other comic book movies, Spider-Man brought the best of the series to the screen without needless changes aimed at \\"marketing\\" to a broader audience.<br />My only complaint with the film was the Green Goblin's costume.  Defoe is one of Hollywood's greatest modern faces, he can convey a broad range of emotions simply by changing the expression on his face. Yet in Spider-Man his face is covered with a metal shell which doesn't move at all.  Not even when he speaks.  This unfortunate decision, the only bankrupt concept inherited from the Batman films, mutes Defoes effectiveness as the Goblin right when needed most.  I found myself wishing he confronted Spider-Man as Norman Osborn rather than the lifeless robot impersonating the Green Goblin.

We all need to make every day count and share our love with family and friends.

Masterfully striking a balance between her blues-folk roots, avant-leanings, and soaring pop sensibility, it serves as a summary of Harvey's prior achievements.

0385503954|1.0|Atonement: A Novel : Tragedy And Social Commentary <BR>By B Michael <BR>There was no author more brilliant during the 16th century than Ian McEwan. Still, while scholars often feel Atonement: A Novel is drug-influenced, it is one of McEwan's most timeless works. In the following paragraphs, I will show that most conservative critics are wrong about McEwan's use of loss of innocence. This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) the Romantic views of Atonement: A Novel's protagonist, Tom Dick, (2) McEwan's famous incorporation of satire in the work, and (3) the author's incorporation of sexual identity. <br />First, when parents dismiss Atonement: A Novel as a simple roman a clef, all I can say is, yet again, the curs of ignorance slaver at the heels of reason. While this fact allays most of McEwan's Italian detractors, it has led a certain Symbolist critic-- the execrable Robert Frost --to proclaim \\"totally, McEwan's intentions for Benvolio Sawyer are ambiguous here.\\" This reasoning differs radically from traditional theories of the post Minimalist school. <br />Second, critics are dead wrong when they cite Atonement: A Novel as an example of McEwan's dwindling will to live. It's quite obvious that McEwan's will to live was tenuous at best by the time Atonement: A Novel was completed. Developments in the opening monologue are often cited as evidence; at best, this is the drug-influenced critique. Give me a...  break! <br />Could the so-called \\"Romantic\\" critics be more wrong about Atonement: A Novel? The author uses dystopic future-vision to transform Colonel Adams from a ponderous bit-player into a triumphant hero. Ichabod Maxwell is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of McEwan's late 17th century influences show through; it is no great feat to realize McEwan has written himself into a corner here! <br />Atonement: A Novel should be required reading for all teens. Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book. Though contemporaries found McEwan's use of juxtapostion pandering, history will vindicate Atonement: A Novel. This book is perhaps the greatest exploration of religion mankind has ever seen. <br />The End
B000003TAW|5.0|What a year 1994 was for music.  NIN, Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Dinosaur Jr. and Bush(yes bush) all released thier best albums. At the same time REM released Monster, which is just awesome and Nirvana's Unplugged came out.  I still listen to all of these great albums from time to time but Weezer's Blue album gets more play time than all those combined.  From the high energy opeaner &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot; to the melancholy yet orgasmic end of &quot;Only in Dreams&quot; this album is amazing.(and its not even their best one) Every song on this album has been my second favorite song on it.  The top spot is reserved for &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;  Beautiful both lyrically and musically this song tugs at your heart for the whole 8 minutes with its crescendo/decrescendo arrangements.  &quot;Holiday&quot; makes you want to pack your bags and go on a road trip, mabey to see Weezer.  &quot;Say it ain't so&quot; is a classic I will probaly still sing it to myself when im 80.  &quot;In the garage&quot;, &quot;Undone&quot;, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; make you want to start a band.  Its just a fun album regardless of the mood your in.  Patrick Wilson is possibly the best drummer since John Bauner(Zepplin I dont know how to spell his name) with mabey the exception of the drummer from Appleseed Cast.  Rivers is just a poet.  Just a truely great album.  If you don't own this cd don't tell anyone and just order it here so the guy at the record store wont make fun of you.  If you like this one Pinkerton is even better.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Agaetis Byrjun And The Aristotle Doctrine Of 1776 That Cut Off Relations With Rome <BR>Agaetis Byrjun was a moving turning-point in British history. While other triumphant academics may disagree, it is monumental to see that Agaetis Byrjun was in fact a product of the Colonialism movement and its Ottoman followers. This claim is confirmed by three reknown points: the Neo-Nazism manifesto written by Mark Twain, the French Act of 1916, and the Mikhail Gorbachev Depression of 1944. <br />The Japanese Declaration of 1777 had a moving role in Agaetis Byrjun because, as Benjamin Franklin said, \\"As the Italian governing-class say, there are three sexes, men, women, and clergymen.\\" (Gould 83) Though this was written during the French Election of 1940, it is already evident that Nationalism ideals had infiltrated the brilliant thoughts of academics. This begs the question, was Agaetis Byrjun New Historicism? In 1942 it was thought that \\"Praise undeserved is scandal in disguise.\\" (Marx 118) Dubiously historical writers have marginalized the part of Reaganism in Agaetis Byrjun. <br />In modern times our memories of Agaetis Byrjun have become faded. But, in reality, the lessons of Agaetis Byrjun are more relevant than ever. As prominent scholars like Stephen Jay Gould have noted, \\"Agaetis Byrjun ought to be the only study of a prince.\\" (Gould 90) The world was changing. Changing, with the help of Agaetis Byrjun. <br />The End<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B000063DIR|1.0|It saddened me greatly when I found out about what Ozzy and Sharon have done. Last weekend I bought these re-mastered CD's of \\"Diary Of A Madman\\". If I had known that Ozzy had ruined these legendary albums like this I wouldn't have ever bought them ! This is so sick it's beyond belief. It's an unimaginable insult to the fans. Does he really think that we're so stupid that we couldn't tell the difference ?! I'm a huge Randy Rhoads fan and I feel this is very disrespectful to his memory and to the wonderful work that he left behind. I've been a life long Ozzy fan and I feel insulted by what he has done ! I've bought everything he has put out. But if he doesn't fix this and do the right thing, then I will never again buy anything else from Ozzy Osbourne ! He should just pay these two men the royalty money they have earned. It says on these re-issue's that they are \\"Re-mastered from the original masters !\\" How could they ever have the nerve to say that with Daisley and Kerslake taken off ??!! These are terribly mixed CD's. To make matters even worse, they also faded these songs out sooner then they were on the original recordings. So their shorter then they were when the original Blizzard of Ozz\\" band recorded them ! It's an insult to Randy Rhoads and his legacy. I can't believe that on this the twentieth anniversary of Randy's death that Ozzy and Sharon would disrespect him like that. Not to mention the insult to Lee and Bob, whose playing on those records was so instrumental in their success. If not for the success of those two records where would Ozzy and Sharon be today? I can guarantee you, without the great success of those records, there would be no World tours, no Ozzfest and there would be no MTV show starring the two of them, along with their foul-mouthed, spoiled children. So much of what they have today can be traced back to those two records and for them to go ahead and do what they have done is heartbreaking. DO NOT BUY THESE CD'S! I FIND IT VERY SAD THATOZZY HAS RUINED THE INTEGRITY OF IS BEST MUSIC.<BR>NEVER AGAIN WILL FUTURE ROCK FANS AND GUITAR PLAYERS GET A CHANCE TO HEAR RANDY RHOADS ORIGINAL WORK ! THE ORIGINAL WORK OF THE GREATEST GUITAR PLAYER IN THE WORLD HAS NOW BEEN DEFACED ! THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF OZZY'S GREED ! IT IS NOW A \\"DIARY OF A GREEDY MAN\\" !
630027120X|4.0|After seeing the movie &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; I thought there was no movie I would ever see that was as good.  But after viewing &quot;The Mission&quot;, I stand corrected.  &quot;The Mission&quot; was a superb movie portraying love, compassion, and hope.  Viewing this movie gives people a better  understanding of forgiveness and acceptance.  It shows how a person can completely turn their life around, to a life of God.  I think that all people should be able to witness this movie and be able to experience the enormous amounts of love and forgiveness.
B00003Q438|4.0|First of all, let's look at this from the standpoint of the DVDs themselves.  The picture quality is great, numerous special features and easter eggs, great sound.  A+.  <br />The acting - For the most part, the acting is top notch.  There are some problems with a little bit of overacting by the military group and the continual sense of urgency by many of the cast throughout the film, even before there is any need to feel that way, but for the most part, emotions are well acted, and most of the characters have more than 2 dimensions.  If you throw in the deleted scenes so that you get a better sense of the relationships among the various players, they come even further alive. B+<br />Storyline - I could add more categories, but I'll stop with this one.  Some people have argued that this movie moves too slow or that the dialogue seems contrived at points.  I disagree.  I think too many reviewers look at this as an action film and fail to realize that it was primarily a drama in an action laden environment.  We are looking at the interactions of a group of different individual psyches in a contained environment.  From that standpoint it is a great character film.  But it fails the same place 90+% of Hollywood movies fail in that the ending is flat, even the alternate ending.  ****Spoiler Alert**** You are left with too many what next anti-climax questions and an alien force that is vastly technologically superior to our own that is suddently going to live among us in peace, etc. etc. even though we have no interactions with them to show their benevolence.  It also fails in the number of odd or improbable situations that continually pop up all at once, which, much like tripping when being chased by the axe murderer, are constant cliches in Hollywood films.  Still, with all said, I found the movie very enjoyable, only mildly predicable, with excellent cinematography although a few of the shots would better have been served from different angles and fewer transitions. B<br />Overall - B+
B0000508U6|5.0|caught in knee-deep misery caused by end-less rainy days,bad national football team results or whatever,this downbeat album draws strength from its melodic smarts and shimmering tunes.Frontman Chris Martin is a singer with a bruised psyche,often offering tuneful epics and emotive arrangements that never fall into triteness.Coldplay is a bright one for the future and this debut is enough to give the world reason to believe that great British pop is still very much alive.
B00005JKBC|2.0|Too much fluff. Too much imagery without any character development. Brad Pitt's charcter or that of the English girl (for whom he supposedly goes rogue) is underdeveloped to the maximum. Also, ending was too predictable and hence preposterous.<BR>Not much to think there.

I have watched countless docu-dramas of many people and this was by far the best! I have watched all his fights over and over. I will never cease to be amazed by him. This film and Will Smith came as close to reality as possible in the time frame allotted. There were so many realistic gestures by Will along with the VOICE, it was spooky!I am not familiar enough with the Muslim faith and the facts of Mr. Ali's private life to criticize the over all portrayal of him in the movie, but I will always admire the stand he took against the draft and his reasons for it. I am a disabled, caucasian Viet Nam vet. I also admire what he means to African-Americans, Africans and many millions like me world wide. Yes, people will nit pick about minor flaws in the movie, but how do you ever do justice to a man who is still a living legend?????
1558908323|4.0|Mimic is a \\"bug\\" movie, and a pretty good one.  This time the threat comes from man-sized, roachlike creatures, that threaten to multiply and make pest control a nightmare.<br />Roaches in New York City are spreading a deadly disease.  Entomologist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) introduces genetically altered roaches to the local population via the local sewers.  Secretions from the mutant bugs known as the \\"Judas breed\\" destroys the metabolic systems of cockroaches, causing them all to die.<br />Three years later, neighborhood kids bring the \\"Bug Lady\\" (Susan) an unusual insect they have collected from the subway tunnels.  Though it escapes, the specimen sets Susan and her physician husband Peter (Jeremy Northam), on the trail of the mysterious insect species.  The search leads to the subway and sewer systems.  Peter, who works for the Center for Disease Control, heads down into the subway system with his assistant Josh (Josh Brolin), and Leonard, a city cop (Charles Dutton).  Meanwhile, Susan is gathered in by one of the roach creatures and deposited somewhere in the sewer system.  Also wandering in the underground, are Manny (Giancarlo Giannini), a shoeshine man, looking for his lost son, Chuy.  Soon they all come together in a life and death struggle against the killer bugs.<br />This movie is dark and creepy, and the musical score by Marco Beltrami adds to that atmosphere.  Tension builds, for like all good horror films, we don't get to see the big bugs too soon.  But once the attack begins, things move swiftly, and the level of excitement remains high until the conclusion.<br />The special effects are good, not great, and do not dominate the movie.  The build-up of the story is good, and helps to add to the plausibility of the plot line, though there are still some problems.  The whole concept of man-sized roaches evolving from normal sized bugs may be hard to accept, despite the explanation provided for this phenomena.  The concept of the roaches \\"mimicking\\" humans is interesting, but very hard to swallow.  The creatures are so fast and strong, why would they need to infiltrate the human population, when they could kill us so easily.  We see the creature \\"unfold\\" itself just before it sweeps Susan off the subway platform, and there is no way that it could pass for human, in anything but near dark conditions.  Finally, if the Judas breed could wipe out roaches in NYC, wouldn't they have used them in other places too?<br />All that being said, this movie is very enjoyable and highly recommended.  The roach monsters, once the pretense is out of the way, are great fun.  Josh has a cool death scene.  Charles Dutton's aggressive performance was very enjoyable.  It's also fun to see Mira Sorvino getting down and very dirty.  With a little better character selection this movie could have been much better.  One big negative about this film is the young boy Chuy (sorry kid).  There is nothing appealing about this irritating, spoon clapping character.mans is interesting, but very hard to swallow.

B00005R2M3|4.0|Decent cd. Other than her main hits there are really only 1 or 2 other songs that may be popular. The cd has a rock edge, but is still a little poppy, however this cd is very different than anything I have ever heard. I like it, but I am sure it is not her best work.

I bought this one for the song &quot;Escape.&quot;  So, with my 13-year-old daughter's help in identifying who the artist was, I purchased this CD.  I love EVERY song on this CD.  I feel like my daughter because I keep listening to this over and over and over.  I don't even mind sitting in traffic if I have this CD in the car.  (That should tell you how good it is!)  Every song is fun and sing-able!  I HIGHLY recommend it!

B000002LMK|4.0|From the first piercing wails on \\"Country Home,\\" you can tell Neil Young's \\"Ragged Glory\\" will not go light on the guitar work.  Overall, the album possesses an honest and rugged sound the whole way through, just straight-ahead guitar rock 'n roll, coupled with no-nonsense lyrics. The songs sometimes stray to well over six minutes, but they don't wander aimlessly and they're anything but boring. On \\"White Line,\\" the brief background vocals are reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000002J0P Crosby, Stills & Nash]], but the song is carried by its sense of freedom in the lyrics. In fact, \\"Ragged Glory\\" somehow conveys a sense of being true to oneself, both in Young's lyrics and in its tough sound. The third tune on this album, a song that's been covered nicely by [[ASIN:B000ETQRCM Pearl Jam]] in their concerts, might be the album's signature song, a rugged, brutally honest song for anyone who's ever suffered even remotely from an inferiority complex.<br /><br />There's excellent lead guitar work everywhere on \\"Ragged Glory,\\" but the rhythm guitar also gives Young's record a real flair, a thick sound throughout. You can't help but love songs like \\"Over and Over\\" and \\"Love to Burn,\\" where Young starts singing a new verse at around six minutes, thirty seconds, as he waits for the raging guitars to quiet down. But for all their raging guitars and blistering fretwork, Neil Young and Crazy Horse never sacrifice tunefulness -- they know a good song is a melodic song.<br /><br />It all ends on a long, jammed-out flourish with \\"Love and Only Love\\" and \\"Mother Earth.\\" Songs like these don't get played on classic rock radio, but they're classic nonetheless. Fans of Neil Young will love this record, but true fans of rock will also find it more than engaging.

B00003CX5P|4.0|I was the first geek to arrive on the scene for the Epidsode I camp out the night before tickets went on sale at the Cinema 6 in Tooele, UT. I had read the book, and the Graphic Novel in advance, so I knew exactly what I was getting into when the film began. My expectations for this film were set at a pretty good level. I knew the story already, and was expecting a movie version of that story as I knew it.<br /> The problem with Episode I is not necissarily the film itself. Although far from perfect Episode I is still creative, and innovative in its own right, and still revolutionary being the first movie to offer thousands of photorealistic computer generated characters in any given scene. The overal story is still very good, but I will confess the movie is not without its flaws.<br /> Jar Jar Binks became annoying after a while, but did not detract from the over all movie. I do not see Jar Jar in any light different than I see C-3PO, who is equally annoying. However, the dry acting of this film really weakens what could have otherwise been the best of the Star Wars movies to date. Despite the dry acting, the story (I cannot stress this enough) is still very strong. The movie even features the best lightsaber fight scenes to date. Over all this movie is not only worth the price of admission, but is also a worthy addition to the Star Wars series. A friend of mine once stated that to judge the Star Wars movies individually is foolish. This is just a small part of a much larger story, and while I anticipate that Attack of the Clones will be both darker and more mature than the Phantom Menace. In all reality The Phantom Menace is equally as good as A New Hope (Episode IV) which also has problems with acting and annoying characters (ironically Luke, at that point.)<br /> The DVD is the first of the series to land on the format and is quite possibly the most jam packed DVD of all time. I've had this disk since it came out and I am still finding nifty easter eggs several months later. And I don't think that there has ever been a DVD that has taken your hand through every step of the film making process the way that this one did. It was a great education in the making of the Star Wars movie, and sure made the process look lik a lot of fun, with a few hazards tossed in for good measure. The various making of featuretts are like an epic movie in and of themselves and are in many ways better than the movie itself. Collectors should buy this DVD, if not for the movie, than for the incredable DVD extras.later.

B000002952|5.0|I am not particularly a fan of Gloria Estefan, but everything about this CD is nearly perfect; the selections are great, and the quality of the arrangements (Jaunito Marquez, I believe) and the musicians are superb.  The rythms are mostly cuban boleros and son montuno, a refreshing break from today's salsa. For those interested, there is an excellent piano album of this CD.
B00005QIPH|5.0|No band deserves to have the weight of being &quot;the second coming of the Velvet Underground&quot; or &quot;the second coming of Television&quot; on their backs. It is a truly unfair comparison in my opinion; no band could ever live up to it.<br />The problem with the Strokes is that overhyped or not, they really are worthy of great praise. Formed around 1995 or so, and I recommend reading about them, they spent a few years playing the Manhattan club circuit until finally coming up with a 3 track demo. That demo eventually made it to the offices of Rough Trade, where, well, the rest is history, innit?<br />New York has always had a plethora of fantastic rock bands and you simply can't deny that The Stokes are a hell of a great band. Do yourself a favor and forget everything you read. Forget everything that comes out of the bands mouths. Forget you've even heard about them. Just get this CD as if you knew nothing about them, put it on your stereo, turn the volume all the way up and just...... listen. Don't believe the hype - they really are that good.
B000063DI8|2.0|In a word, awful. This CD contains three decent hit singles in \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter\\" and another catchy tune in the aptly-named \\"Hooks In You\\". Stupid and derivative lyrics and substandard musicianship aside (not that they play them bad, but these are songs where a band like Maiden can just \\"phone it in\\"), all are good enough to make you hum along with repeated listens. Too bad they're surrounded by turkeys like \\"Mother Russia\\", \\"Fates Warning\\", \\"Public Enema Number One\\", \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and \\"The Assassin\\". The title track is acceptable, although it's basically the blueprint for \\"Afriad To Shoot Strangers\\" on the following album (and \\"Strangers\\" is better). And what's up with Bruce Dickenson's voice? He sounds like he's been gargling battery acid and chain smoking unfiltered pieces of tire rubber. I would call this the weakest album they've ever done. <br />Also, a comment on the revamped cover - why did they edit out the guy with the lantern looking into the grave? On the original cover, Eddie was grabbing the guy's throat. Now he just seems to be clutching empty air. Plus the coloring is drastically different between the two covers. Go to a used CD store and find the original (I guarantee there'll be PLENTY of them there) and see what I mean!

B00005QY5Y|5.0|Like many, I bought this CD out of curiosity because of the reviews it received.  I was not a big fan of it at first.  But after giving it a chance and a few spins in the CD player, I came to one conclusion:  very addictive.  Adams grew on me very quickly.  It is a CD full of emotion and soul.  If you would enjoy a mix of Counting Crows meets Dylan meets Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines, buy this CD and let it grow on you.  You won't be dissapointed........

B0000025HG|4.0|Barbra Streisand's 1979 album WET is an album with an aquatic theme, the songs all include references and/or metaphors pertaining to water. It is a fairly consistent album, however the introduction of songs such as \\"Splish Splash\\", \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Anymore\\" or \\"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\\" interupt the natural flow of the album. While the latter is a great disco song with Donna Summer, it seems to interupt the flow of the album. The remainder of the songs here are shimmering ballads, and this would be a perfect album if all the songs were ballads. However vocally these songs are spectacular, Barbra is on par with the material. The title track is a soft touching ballad, while \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\" is a powerful ballad. The real gem here is the ballad \\"After The Rain\\", which is as good as they come! Other highlights include \\"Niagara\\", \\"Come Rain Or Shine\\", and \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\". Overall its a worthwhile album to add to your Streisand collection.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I'm not going to repeat most of the stuff that's already been said about this CD (all the song by song critiques).  Chances are, if you're reading this review, then you're aware of the quality music that Dream Theater consistently puts out.  Since I bought this CD almost a month ago, I still have not listened to the first disc- I popped in Disc 2 (Six Degrees) and it hasn't left my stereo since then; it's really that good.  The music is absolutely phenomenal- a bit laid back and more of a relaxed feel than their previous \\"Scenes from a Memory,\\" and definitely more of a classical influence from keyboardist Jordan Rudess.  <br />The only problem I have with this CD, as with ALL of their music, is the substandard lyrics.  Absolutely unacceptable.  I can't understand how a band that can play so many notes with such virtuosity cannot put together a decent set of lyrics to accompany their instruments.  Granted, they have shown much improvement since their previous efforts (example from \\"Scenes...\\"- \\"Where are we going, why are we here, where do we go when we die\\"... <br />I think it's safe to say that Dream Theater has secured itself as one of the most technically superb group of musicians out there today- all they have left to do is to back off the notes and put some genuine emotion into their work, and this CD is unquestionably a step in the right direction.<br />Overall, still a great album- just ignore the lyrics and you'll be listening to this CD for a long time.
B00005OAIE|5.0|for starters, I thought Rickey Wright's review was way off.  in all the reviews that I read, no one mentioned &quot;Your Body Is a A Wonderland.&quot;  If some guy said those words to me, my knees may buckle!  for such a young person to be so profound is wonderful.  I hope John Mayer is around for a long, long time!

I originally tried not to listen to it too much because I didn't want to get sick of it, but that hasn't happened.  I've owned this CD for about 1/2 year and I listen to it almost everyday.  I can't get enough, and I don't think I ever will.  This album is leaps and bounds beyond their debut and it is only their second album!  I'm scared to hear what they will come up with next.  I use to hail Radiohead as the most amazing musical groundbreakers and just flat out producing the best music around - not any more.
B000006TRV|5.0|you've never experienced true music until you listen to this album. every song gives dettils as to what could easily be considered the meaning life. this is by far the best album released by pink floyd, especially due to the fact that it's so personal and is an autobiography of Roger Waters. over all, this is amoung the best albums to grace the rock and world.
B000002H8F|5.0|I'd whine about the hip-joined cluster of \\"Spin\\" rejects who use this disc as a mere stair on the way to the holy pinnacle of \\"Surfer Rosa\\" (inexplicably, \\"Trompe Le Monde\\" seems to be the cracked, gum-stained sidewalk UNDER the steps). But maybe three out of a hundred critics even utter a syllable that SOUNDS like \\"pixies\\" in the midst of one of their baby-boomer-like eulogies for the days of Nirvana, so those of us convinced of this Boston foursome's importance better take it with a smile however we can get it, right? <br />This sun-baked beach pup's got twice the sonic heft of \\"Doolittle\\" and four times the coherence of \\"Surfer Rosa\\", and I wouldn't just run out into oncoming traffic to get another copy of this disc, I'd sell your Irish grandma into a year's ball-scratching duty on some rapper's traveling ho squad, if so much as a gnarly piece of dust scratched the JEWEL CASE. Wistful references to the West Coast are sandwiched between thick, whole-grain hunks of open, twangy guitar reverb that make me nostalgic for my junior-high stomping grounds of late-80s California. \\"Havalina\\" is as light and airy and multi-harmonied as you need to close things on that perfect note. And \\"Ana\\" SOUNDS LIKE it's about this sun-kissed blonde-goddess type in my old complex in San Leandro, undressing on the beach. Elsewhere, \\"Velouria\\" is the song I wish I'd stumble across some old Saturday Night Live footage of them performing, and if (as all Pixie-heads know) Kurt Cobain cited the previous album's \\"Gouge Away\\" as the starting point for \\"Teen Spirit\\", then \\"Rock Music\\" must've spawned \\"Breed\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings\\", along with half of \\"In Utero\\". Grunge and alternative certainly don't start here, but they stop in for drinks so often, you hear their names called out with every stormcloud of fuzz kicked up by the guitars, every coo and \\"ahh\\" that bassist Kim Deal fills in the cracks with. And, to my prejudicial mind, their \\"Allison\\" is a better \\"Allison\\" than Elvis Costello's \\"Allison\\" if only 'cuz my girlfriend wants it played at our wedding, and comes out doing a happy dance every time it blares from our boom-box speakers. Of course, on my bootleg concert video, Frank says it's really about songwriter Mose Allison, but the personal magic remains......<br />Highlights: Tracks 1-14. Minuses: The [darn] thing ends.
0060930187|4.0|Are you the type of person that doesn't like to read that much? Do books bore you? Do you dread reading books assigned by your teachers at school? Is it hard for you to pick a book of your choice to read? If you answered yes to those questions, you might want to consider stopping by your local library or bookstore to purchase The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. Though this book isn't a hot new release it's just as fresh as the books of today. It enters the mind of teenagers of today, which is good that teenagers are able to relate with the main character, Esther Greenwood. With all of the trials and tribulations that she goes through, it's almost a sure thing that readers could find at least one thing in common with her.<BR>The fact that the author continued page after page to throw all these problems at Esther could be considered an issue. Some reader's might think that maybe it was too much. Though if one were to see things in another light they could see it as the problems being stepping stones in life. Esther was climbing up but in reality she knew that sometimes you just have to start over for the best. Sylvia Plath proved in this book that you can fall rock bottom in your life and still be able to be on top once more.
B000002572|5.0|At a time when so many bands were using synthisizers and disco was still running strong this band game out with an album that smacked you in the face and woke you up.  There are so many powerful songs on this disc that it keeps you interested one after another.  Each track can stand very well on its own and fits into the album concept.  A classic from my younger days that I still enjoy listening to.  I have heard that it is overplayed on the radio but I don't pay much attention to radio play-lists anymore, I hardly ever listen.  <br />If you want a classic 1970's rock album or an introduction to Boston this is your one.  Unfortunately as time went on their projects lost ground steadily and they turned into a shell of the powerhouse that they were at the release of this album.  This album is indicative of the promise of the band that could not hold its head above the original high water mark it set for itself.  A victim of their own initial outstanding effort. <br />Do yourself a favor - give this album a listen!

B000056K04|5.0|This album demonstrates why the Dave Matthews Band appeals to such a wide range of people.  In my opinion, the word \\"versatility\\" aptly describes the Dave Matthews Band's performance on Everyday due to the variable styles of songs on this album, as well as the range of instruments employed by the band.  I think it is precisely this versatility that attracts such a diverse audience to this talented set of musicians.  <br />Of course, at the core of this band's music is the extraordinary songwriting talents of the lead musician.  Dave Matthews is among the best contemporary songwriters in popular music today.  As shown on Everyday, he writes melodic and infectious music in connection with poetic and interesting lyrics.  Every song on this album is a compelling composition in its own right.  <br />But the strength of this album does not end with the songwriting.  When such well-crafted songs are performed with the unmistakable heart and soul of the Dave Matthews Band, the result is an absorbing, engrossing experience for the listener.  Everyday is simply a combination of magnificent songwriting and masterful musicianship, which equates to one of the best overall albums I've purchased in quite a while.
6304341849|5.0|A wonderful movie.You don't have to be gay to enjoy this film, but it helps. This post-Victorian era gay coming -of- age love story (whew!), is beautifully told and filmed, in the Merchant-Ivory tradition. James Wilby, and Hugh Grant, before he was Hugh Grant, are very touching as Maurice and Clive, as they discover \\"the love that dare not speak it's name\\". No matter your persuasion, you can't fail to be moved by their predicament in that repressed time where one could still be (and often was) jailed for homosexuality. As sometimes in real life, it is a heartbreakingly told story about the decisions sometimes forced upon us, and the ramifications and resignations of not being true to ones self, because of familial or social restrictions as to what is \\"normal\\" behavior. These charactars, especially Wilby's impeccably portrayed Maurice(pronounced \\"Morris\\"), are good, decent people, who are suffering because they cannot be who they simply are. Without giving away the ending, it is an ultimately up-lifting story about the extreme courage it sometimes takes , then as now, to be true to ones self, and, finding your dignity, in the face of a segment of society that often insists you deserve none. All of the actors, most of whom are unknown to general audiences, are wonderful, in that underplayed, classy English way, making the smallest part integral to the story. A beautiful adaptation of the E.M. Forster novel, and a wonderful love story, with various lessons for all.
B000002H97|5.0|Any one reading these reviews needs to be sure not to listen to anything said by the \\"Hardcore\\" Metallica fans who claim that this is a sell-out album. They are simply incapable of making a valid judgement on this album because they are to attached to their rebellious, hate everything on the radio mentality that when they heard a band that they liked on the radio they started to hate them.<br /> All that being said, this is a major departure from their previous work. It does feature slower speeds, though in a few tracks they kick it up to near the speed of their earlier albums. However, the decrease in speed is off-set by the extreme heaviness of this album, I don't understand how anyone could claim that an album this hard is a sell-out(Also, I own Reign In Blood and assorted other old-school thrash albums, so don't try and think I don't know what is heavy.) And though the songs are shorter, they still average over 5 minutes, and it should be noted that the big radio singles, Sad but True, Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, Where ever I may Roam and The Unforgiven average over 6 minutes in length between them. So having shorter, supposedly radio friendly songs doesn't matter, because they weren't on the radio.<br /> So yes this is a departure, but the songwriting is still excellent, though a little more uneven than the other albums. The Unforgiven is a classic Metal Ballad at least as good as the previous ones and contains the best solo I've ever heard by any band. Sad but True, Enter Sandman and Where ever I may Roam are fantastic, pure metal songs. The God that Failed, perhaps the best song on the Album other than The Unforgiven, is lyrically the best Metallica song ever, and also contains one of Hammet's best solos ever. Also note to Megatrius(or whatever) TGTF isn't about Jesus failing when he was crucified. It's about a child dying becuase the family wouldn't allow him to have medical treatment because it is against their religious beliefs. This song comes from Hetfield's Christian Scientist upbringing and the death of his mother. I'm sure Megatrius will never read this, and most people listening to the album would know that already, but it's worth pointing out. Further proof that while attempting to a interpret a song you should listen to all of the words, not just 2 lines.<br /> Continuing, The rest of the songs are probably weaker than the average song on Master or Justice, but they are all at least pretty good, and the previously mentioned tracks are so strong that they even it all out. It also has a nice variety overall. The individual songs aren't nearly as complex and spiraling as some older stuff, but the overall feel of each song is quite different. The weakest spot is Nothing Else Matters, as it is a metal ballad that is a bit too much ballad and not enough metal. So all things being taken into consideration this is still one of the best albums ever, and amongst my three favorite Metallica albums, the others being Master of Puppets and Reload.<br /> Also, here's a few more things for the \\"Hardcore\\" fans to think about. I now hear The original 3 Metallica albums on the radio a lot. Are those albums now sold-out? Also, if new Metallica has so much broader of an appeal than the old, why is it that almost all of the new Metallica fans still really like the old stuff? I virtually never see negative reviews of old Metallica by new fans like myself. \\"Hardcore\\" fans don't need to like new Metallica, but don't try and claim they're sell outs.Hetfield's Christian Scientist upbringing and the death of his mother.

B000009QPG|5.0|I already wrote a review of this a while back, but it was a really poorly written review, and my opinions have changed a bit since then anyway, so anyone who read my old review should just forget about it. But anyway, on to the review.<br />People all love to go on and on about \\"Reign In Blood\\", and while it is a more influential and important album than this one, this one is superior to it in pretty much everyway. \\"Reign In Blood\\" was simply too repetitive, and the \\"extreme\\" lyrics were just pretty stupid. This album contains a decent variety of songs, even if they are all still thrash-metal. It's also a more consistent album from beginning to end, though it still has a few weaker spots. The performances are great, for the most part. Araya's bass is essentially overshadowed, but the sheer fact that it can keep up with the guitars is impressive. His vocals aren't brilliant, but they fit the music well, and are an improvement over the overly dramatic vocals from Reign. The lead guitars aren't too brilliant, but they too have improved, and the rhythm guitars are simply brilliant, particularly on the Hanneman penned songs. Lombardo's drumming is simply spectacular on this album, perhaps the single greatest improvement over Reign. His performance on this album is simply the  best performance I've ever heard, by anyone. The lyrics have improved quite a bit, with the more violent lyrics being less self-parodically extreme, and some genuine social criticism on a couple tracks.<br />It opens up brilliantly with the stunningly fast and intense \\"War Ensemble\\". Though it is essentially a retread of  \\"Angel of Death\\", with very similar basic structure and riffing, it is still compelling, with some particularly stuning drum work. \\"Blood Red\\" is one of the slower ones, with some nice drumming and some surprisingly catchy vocals, particularly for thrash. \\"Spirit In Black\\" is one of best, with some awesome riffing and drumming, and a great bridge. \\"Hallowed Point\\" is pure old thrash, which is followed by one of the slower songs, \\"Skeletons of Society\\" which has an awesome chorus as well. The title track is also one of the top songs, with probably the best drumming of any single song I've ever heard. The rest of the album is quite strong, though not as good as these ones. Their are two notable weak spots, \\"Born of Fire\\" and \\"Expendable Youth\\". These aren't really bad songs, but they are fairly undistinguished, as is the case with much of the King penned material.(Hanneman writes almost all of the best Slayer stuff that I've heard) \\"Dead Skin Mask\\" isn't a total success, but it is different enough from much of the other stuff too make up for some problems with the vocals.<br />So, in short, this album is good.

0671799320|5.0|This is one of the best books, in any genre, that I have ever read.  <br />It is truly an epic.  It spans most of human history and the entire globe.  It has history, economics, money, adventure, world politics, war, personalities, social commentary, geopolitical strategy, geology, geography and the lyrics to the Beverly Hillbillies theme song.   <br />Through almost 800 pages, Yergin manages to sustain a high level of interest.  The writing is logical and concise without being dry.  He manages to follow oil into all its nooks and crannies and yet to keep things organized so it is easy to follow.   It's a page-turner!<br />I cannot say enough good things about this book.  If you want to understand the economic and social history of oil and its role in the modern world, this is the only book you'll need.
044651652X|4.0|After completing the epilogue to Bridges, A Thousand Country Roads, I reread Bridges and found the same emotional impact I felt the first time around. Wow! I have missed that. I also took a previous reviewer's challenge and read these novels next to Shade of the Maple, whose cover says it is 'the most intimate novel since The Bridges of Madison County.' I beg to differ. It is more intimate and better than Bridges. Heresy to some, I know, but find out for yourself. Intense descriptions, page-turning drama, a deep understanding of the human heart and an ending that you will never forget. Plus the author is donating $1.00 from every sale to breast cancer research. If half the people who pick up Bridges or its epilogue also pick up Martin's book, we'd raise a lot of money, and I can guarantee a lot of people will have found a new favorite author. In summary, if you liked Bridges, you owe it to yourself to read both Shade of the Maple and A Thousand Country Roads.

B000002HRE|5.0|...  Reload certainly is different from what they made in the eighties but it still is Metal.  It is still loud and aggressive, and that is what defines metal, not the speed. The songs lack much of the old speed, but it isn't totally gone, as in Fuel, Bad Seed, Attitude and Prince Charming. And despite the loss of speed, which I do miss from older recordings, they have improved in many ways.  The variety is greater on this album than most of the older stuff.  Lars's drumming is by far the best of any of their albums, especially on Bad Seed and Fuel. Hetfield's vocal range has broadened, and it actually sounds the way his voice sounds, which was a major problem with the early albums.(though poor eighties sound quality is to blame for that)  Kirk's lead guitar is more consistently interesting than his older stuff as well, with more actually musicality to it and less dull, extremely fast scaling up and down which sometimes plagued the earlier material.(None of this is meant to be a criticism of old Metallica. ALL of their work is great.) And lastly, and probably most significantly, I don't want everything a band writes to sound exactly the same. Metallica did thrash for 10 years, and better than anyone else did, so they decided to change it up a bit. They had taken it as far as they could. But anyway, I'll now just go on to a song by song break down.<br />1. Fuel- Perhaps the best song on here. Very fast, excellent drumming and a great chorus.<br />2. The Memory Remains- Slower and more methodical. Has another excellent chorus, and a great solo in the middle.<br />3. Devil's Dance- One of the weaker tracks. Still pretty good though. Has some nice ominous guitars and a good intro.<br />4. The Unforgiven II- Pretty good, but it's really hampered by not being nearly as good as the first.<br />5. Better Than You- Has a great main riff. The lyrics are fairly pointless, and the repetition of the chorus in the distorted voice isn't very good, but these are minor flaws.<br />6. Slither- Good, straight and simple Metal.<br />7. Carpe Diem Baby- Lyrics are again weak, but it is great slow and brooding track.<br />8. Bad Seed- This is the main other contender for best song.  Very heavy, and oddly toned riff, and some great double bass during the second chorus.<br />9. Where the Wild Things Are- The strangest track on the album, but one of the best. Very atmospheric with more great drumming and interesting guitar. Has a good chorus as well, though it would be preferable if it had conventional singing for the verses.<br />10. Prince Charming- One of the faster and heavier tracks. Has perhaps the single best main riff, and a very catchy chorus.<br />11. Low Man's Lyric- The strange ballad of the album. Has good lyrics, and provides an interesting change of pace, though they should only include one of these per album.<br />12. Attitude- Probably the single heaviest track on the album.  The lyrics are, once again, sub-par, but the this can largely be ignored. Is also one of the faster songs.<br />13. Fixxxer- Another one of the best tracks. The longest song on the album with better than average lyrics and some excellent lead guitar.<br />Overall this is one of my 3 favorite, Metallica albums, among which I can't choose a single best one. The other 2, The Black Album and Master of Puppets would probably be a better starting place if you don't own any Metallica.6. Slither- Good, straight and simple Metal. <br />7.

B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis may not be the best jazz artist ever, but he is certainly the most eclectic and accomplished.  During his long and illustrious career, he has covered just about every possible subgenre of jazz while retaining his own style too.  However, many still see this as his crowning achievement.  I wouldn't say that it summarizes all of jazz in one album, as some have argued (jazz is much stronger and much more diverse than that) but it is one of the best that was ever made.  If you don't have this album, you're really missing out on a lot.
B00002DEH3|5.0|I bought this set in Dec. '01 and it has since become a favorite in my collection. Schubert is a great composer and in my opinion, the quartets are where he really shines.<br /><br />  Sadly, it is hard to find recordings of all but the last four. In total, there are fourteen plus two fragments- one incomplete and one lost. They are all here and at such a good deal!<br />  The first two discs (first five quartets and a fragment) really stand out. These were quartets Schubert composed as a student and they capture well the energy of youth and have a beautifully simple quality that always makes Schubert stand out. The middle discs track his early career with a more mature motif development revealing a taste of the boldness to come from his later quartets. Not as melodic as the first quartets in my opinion, but a treat nonetheless. Then ah! the last three discs. \\"Rosamunde,\\" \\"Death and the maiden,\\" Quartettstatz and C 703. Can you possibly go wrong? Don't answer that. You know it doesn't get better!!<br />  Now we come to recording quality. Well, the Melos Quartet recorded these in the mid 70's. They've been digitally touched up and well done. Still, not convincing enough to sound like new. Treble and Mid is alright but the Bass is really lacking and overall, it still lacks the full sound of recordings from the Emerson and Tokyo quartets. Still, with touchup, these recordings sound more like late 80's- Not Bad!<br />  This is a great deal for a great price. For better quality, I also picked up Emerson's recording of the late quartets, but you will be hard pressed to find a recording of the early and middle works...and what works they are!!!
B00005A1PR|4.0|I liked almost every song off this album. Arie's stylish and polished debut proved that she will be one of the many that will outlast the Britneys and Pinks. Her voice, a combination of Nina Simone, Tracy Chapman, and Lauryn Hill, melts over you and leaves you feeling oh-so-high. I know it's not the same thing, but I'd put this up there with Erykah Badu's debut album as far as sophistication and songwriting. Try &quot;Back to the Middle&quot; and &quot;Promises.&quot;
B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's about time someone packaged the Beatles biggest hits on one disc.  An earlier reviewer complained that the songs were not in mono as they were originally released.  Well, why not put them out on 8 track for crying out loud?!... I never heard those originals on the radio and never played them on a record player so I could not care LESS that some of the tunes are 'stereo-fied' so to speak.  Get over it already.<br />This is an AWESOME collection.  There is only one song on it that I don't care for, everything else shows why the Beatles were the world's biggest, freshest, most-enjoyable band.  You can read the track listing for yourself, it is incredible.  Don't miss out on the best collection of songs since the 1990 Led Zeppelin Box Set.<br />Essential.

B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next is one of the best albums ever recorded.  Hands down.  The Who had many great moments (Quadrophenia) but none of them had the sheer power of this collection of songs.  From the famous 'Baba O'Rily' to the haunting 'Behind Blue Eyes' to the grandiose arena rock of 'Won't Get Fooled Again' to the gorgeous 'The Song is Over', the Who are at the top of their game.  The bonus tracks on this reissue are also a nice addition.  This album should be in every rock fan's collection without exception.<br />ESSENTIAL
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Above all else, I think movies are supposed to be entertaining, and that's exactly what Moulin Rouge was from beginning to end. I have a whole new appreciation for the talent and range of Nicole Kidman. It was a very nice surprise to find out that not only can she portray any kind of character, but she can really sing too! Ewan McGregor was perfect as the man who loves her; he makes this romantic story believable. But I think the main star of this movie is Baz Lurhmann. It is obvious from the very beginning to the last frame of the film that his creativity and talent make this movie so entertaining and so watchable. His choice of music is just right; his use of splashy color and costume sets the tone for the fabulous production numbers; and his sense of humor along with his sense of romance just brings this movie to life. It is just incredible to me that he was not nominated for an Academy Award for his direction of this film. There just aren't that many movies this clever and this entertaining in theaters today. Yes, there are movies that are good for many different reasons, but Lurhmann goes the extra mile to give his audience something that isn't going to be duplicated anywhere else. Come What May, he's always unique!
B00001U03Q|5.0|What a great CD!  I have been a fan of Eric Clapton's for years and each time a new recording of his is released I rejoice...This CD is an overview/summary of his current hits that he has had and let me say that it is quite impressive.  From &quot;Change the World&quot; to &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; to the revamped &quot;Layla&quot; that became even more famous on his MTV's Unplugged CD, each and every song is impressive.  This man can play the guitar masterfully in his unique guitar style.  He can also sing very nicely as well.  Overall a must have for any Rock and Roll Fan!<br />Highly Recommended!
B00005JKL8|3.0|This above average military-techno-action thriller and recruitment tool was entertaining stuff. By combining small elements of \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Bat 21\\", and even \\"The Terminator\\", and \\"True Lies\\", this movie aimed for a demographic bullseye for the studio's target audience of the moment, and fully aware of that demographic's limited attention span, wrapped up the digital/celluloid action in something less than 2 hours. Always dependable Gene Hackman was excellent as the hard bitten and frustrated Admiral Riegart.  I especially liked the fresh face of Owen Wilson as a recalcitrant Navy officer/mouse locked in a game of survival with a pack of ruthless Balkan cats. I still don't exactly know who the enemy/insurgents were supposed to be, was it the Serbs, Bosnians, Croats, or Muslims?  Everyone seemed to play interchangeable roles. In the end, I guess it really didn't make much difference as the point of the excercise was keep it entertaining and keep it moving along. I don't know where they shot the location photography for this movie either but they made me believe it could be the heart of the former Yugoslavia. But the point of the exercise was to celebrate and demonstrate America's superior position as the world's greatest military force and rescuer of hapless pilots. Some of the awesome special effects strained credulity, but nevertheless, the movie as a whole succeeded in providing tantalizing insights into various intellegence gathering techniques at our country's disposal. The predictable ending had just the right amount of pop-corn selling, testesterone elevating elements to make any red-blooded American boy want to sign up for duty. Oh well, war IS hell, but we do love it anyway, don't we?

B00004W56S|3.0|Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford's first album is nothing special, but has some pleasures for Genesis fans. One side of the album is a \\"concept\\" piece about a factory drone who ventures off to discover what exactly it is they are producing. The suite includes the two best songs on the album, the arpeggiated \\"Cats and Rats (in This Neighborhood)\\" and the lively instrumental \\"Out into the Daylight\\". The other half of the album is merely okay; all of the songs would be outtakes on any Genesis album.  Anthony Phillips, the original Genesis lead guitarist, plays keyboards here. I don't care much for singer Noel McCalla's voice--he sounds too much like the hired hand he is.<br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B000002JSN|4.0|Just the songs \\"Trampled under foot\\", \\"Kashmir\\" and \\"Ten years gone\\" alone make this album worth purchasing.<BR>The first Zeppelin album to be released under their own Swan Song label is generally a composite album, adding new material to already existing songs. The instrumental \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" for example was recorded in 1970, but didn't see the light of day until 'Physical Graffiti' in 1975.<BR>Other stand outs include \\"Houses of the holy\\", \\"The Wanton song\\", \\"The rover\\" and \\"Boogie with Stu\\".<BR>One thing in paticular that I like about this album is, even though it's a double album, it isn't very long, (clocking in just over 80 minutes), and that there isn't any filler material, just more or less good songs that the band wanted to put out at the time.<BR>Personally the only songs I don't like are \\"In my time of dying\\" and \\"In the light\\", they arn't really that bad, it's just that they tend to drag on. I find myself skipping over these two songs when I listen to the album.
B000000HZT|3.0|For his first solo album, Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks chose to do a concept album about a man who loses a bet with God, swearing he will never fall in love in return for wisdom and fame, then losing his memory after he does fall in love.  It's not a great album, but it's solid, and it still deserves an occasional listen more than 20 years later.  Of the three Tony Banks albums I have, I like this one best.  And it should appeal to fans of &quot;old&quot; Genesis, as there are several long songs that have more of the early Genesis feel than the material Genesis was recording at the time.  Kim Beacon's voice isn't distinctive, but serves the material well, and Chester Thompson's drumming gives the album a more organic feel than &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.  Banks plays guitar and bass, in addition to keys--while he's an effective rhythm guitarist, there are places where a lead guitar would have made the album stronger.  It's easy to imagine Genesis playing &quot;You&quot; or the menacing &quot;Somebody Else's Dream&quot;.  The endings of &quot;You&quot; and &quot;After the Lie&quot; include the kind of pyrotechnic synthesizer solos Banks is known for.  &quot;For a While&quot; is an effective lost-love song.  There are a couple of long, meandering instrumentals that are mildly pleasant, but hurt the overall pacing of the album.  For you Genesis fans, how much you like this album will be directly proportional to how much you liked &quot;One for the Vine&quot;.

B000002KHB|5.0|I bought this album today and am shocked at how great it is. Every song is incredible, in every instrument. The guitar playing by Blackmore, the keyboards, bass, and vocals are unbelievable. This band was way ahead of their time and they really know how to jam better than any other band ive heard. Highway Star has to be one of the best driving songs ever...Im just getting into this band so if any other fan has any other recommendations fill me in. <BR>      A must have for any rock fan

The book starts with the child Morgaine being swept up in the turmoil of the seduction of her mother Igraine by the High King of Britain, Uther Pendragon. To win Igraine's love Uther must first rid her of her husband Galoise, Morgaine's father.  With help from Merlin the mission was accomplished and the result was the birth of a boy child, Arthur. <BR> The story leads the reader on a spellbinding tale of the two children Morgaine and Arthur and their eventual separation. Arthur to goes off with Merlin to learn to be a good king and Morgaine to be a priestess with Vivianne, Igraine's sister, (and the Lady of the Lake), in the magical realm of Avalon.<BR> Their lives later become entwined and wise Morgaine helps Arthur to his king-hood . A king must have a bride and the Christian priests found such a one for Arthur. \\"Gwenhwyfar was young and dazzlingly pretty; she seemed all white and gold, her skin pale as ivory just stained with coral, her eyes palest blue, her hair long and pale and shining through the mist like living gold\\" (p157). Add the good knight Lancelot, Merlin the druid magician, Vivianne, the Lady of the Lake, a few knights and several villains and the story becomes a full-blown saga of love, deception, suspense, and a struggle for the rise of Christianity and the demise of the old ways of worship. The characters are beautifully constructed and real leaving the reader bereft when the story concludes.<BR> \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is an epic sagathat tells of the struggles of the old pagan tribes inhabiting Britain in the middle of the first millennium and the new religion of Christianity. Morgaine le Fey was on a losing side but when Christianity got its grip on Britain the old religion slipped back into the Fairy realm to be visited only in dreams. The book is not based in historical fact by any means, but provides an alternative look at a legend that has been captivating and intriguing for over a thousand years. The story has two prequels provided in Bradley's next works of fantasy fiction   \\"The Forest House\\" and \\"Lady of Avalon\\".
0393314804|5.0|In the darkest corner of a drug fuelled Scottish sub-culture, its members being sociopaths of the highest order, Irvine Welsh exposes the truth about societies fringe, delving from personal experience as an unemployed, drug using Scot. He, and his characters, resemble \\"normal\\" more than the common man dares to allude. Trainspotting is undoubtedly aimed at the general population in Western society who are so willing to prejudge members of certain sub-cultures. Heroin is tool unto which the protagonist, \\"Rents\\", uses to kick against society- his philosophy being, \\"ah choose no tae choose life\\". He and his \\"associates\\" habituate in the working class city of Leith, Scotland. The mentality unto which the heroin users live is that, \\"nothing exists in ma life except masel and Michael Forrester (heroin)\\". It is a sub-culture where nothing else in the world matters but getting to the next hit, which Rents claims to be virtuous, as it is an escape from reality...life.<br />Trainspotting is a post-modern novel. It the narrative is a series of disjointed anecdotes unlike a carefully constructed novel in literary traditions. This allows it to aim at a wide range of people within society who it is attempting to communicate with, each of them being able to relate to Trainspotting on their own individual levels. Every anecdote is a narrative of events, in both first and third person perspectives. The novel rotates through perspective, giving a voice to the unheard people in our society. Trainspotting gives us a unique perspective on ordinary events in ones life through the eyes of unordinary people. This is important, as it allows Trainspotting is an important way Trainspotting relates to a broad audience. The characters are not narrating the story; it is simply a digest of their thoughts. Trainspotting chronicles how what may seem as exceptional and anti-social behaviour occurs to the junkies, and their subsequent acquaintances, as normal. For instance, throughout the book the character drink alcohol with the sole purpose of intoxication and regularly solve disputes through violence.<br />When Trainspotting is being narrated in first person perspective it is written in phonetic Scottish. The character all speak in a distinctly Scottish sociolect of the lower class, using words such as ken, radge, scoobied, likesay, giro and bairn. Their speech is also filled with expletives. This could possibly isolate non-Scottish readers with little tolerance for other cultures- the type of people Trainspotting is seeking to enlighten. Rents is Welsh's authorial voice, which he has cleverly setup so that it is conceivable that Rents has a sophisticated vocabulary (because he was a university drop out). This is mixture of language aptly communicates to many levels of audience and also serves as breaking certain clichés and stereotypes of lower socio-economic sub-cultures by the fact the author of the book, which would be considered in some circles \\"high brow\\", is (or was) a member of this sub-culture.<br />Trainspotting's social ideology is vehemently disestablishmentarianism,. The characters, particularly Rents, reject all of societies institutions such as education, parenthood in the traditional sense, employment and politics. \\"... them all,\\" asserts Sick Boy. The characters themselves are constructed in a way where really on the rejection of institutions to live their lives, the reason that they become a sub-culture. Society, in Rents opinion, is filled with \\"boring middle class ...\\". People in Western society who are willing to pre-judge people are almost always tied into institutions, particularly political institutions. <br />It is an imcredibly powerful book that indeed does \\"deserve to sell more copies than the Bible\\".
B00005QIPH|5.0|I would have to say that this is one of the best albums I own. This CD is one of a few, where one can listen to every track without getting bored. Personally, I put the CD on and listen to it until its finished. The CD's first single, &quot;Last Nite&quot;, may be annoying to some people, but their are plenty of other good songs on the CD. I highly recommend it.
B000060MY6|1.0|This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worst acting, worst casting, worst editing, worst writing, etc. I would say worst story but there wasn't one. I can't believe someone read this script and said, &quot;We have to make this into a movie.&quot; I can't believe anyone would give Lynch the money to make it. I can't believe it was voted one of the year's best. This movie is a joke. All I can figure is that it has some kind of hypnotic, subliminal message hidden in it saying, &quot;Love this movie. Love this movie.&quot; Thank goodness I was immune. There's nothing to love.
B000056K04|5.0|Don't listen to the reviews that say this album is horrible. No, it's certainly not the dave matthews band's best album, but it's still very good. I like it very much because it just has some real good songs on it like Dreams Of Our Fathers, So Right, What You Are, and Everyday. There is some songs that you'll probably end up skipping over but overall this is still a good album. I wouldn't reccomend this as your first dmb album(I would say get &quot;Crash&quot;) but if liked what you heard from the songs on the radio then you'll like this album. The only complaint I have is that you can barely hear boyd or leroi on the violin and saxophone, and the electric guitar gets annoying.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK not only rocks harder than anyone else on the PLANET, he is also incredibly nice.  I met the man tonight, and after playintg the most high-energy set I have ever seen in a long time going to shows, he was kind, gracious, chivalrous, and sweet as hell.  He deserves all the success he has garnered so far, and more.
B000002WYT|5.0|Yes, this is probably one of the best albums of the 90's. There truly isn't one song one here that makes you want to skip it. This is dmb's most well rounded album with hard hitting tunes like \\"Drive in Drive out\\" and more mellow songs like the mind blowing \\"Proudest Monkey\\". So Much To Say is a good song but get's kinda repetitive after a while but it's still a very good song and that song alone won the band a grammy.<BR>Two Step....well it's one of the best songs written ever by any artist. It starts out slow but builds up to a great song!<BR>Crash Into Me, this is a very good song that got way over played on the radio so it lost a lot of it's appeal.<BR>Too Much, it's one of the harder rocking song's on the album and like So Much To Say it gets a little repetitive.<BR>#41, another GREAT song! I can't describe this song but you just have to hear it. It's so good!<BR>Say Goodbye, #41 leads right into this song so that's pretty cool and this is a great song. The intro is amazingly good. Carter's drumming is mindblowing!<BR>Drive In Drive Out, This is one of my favorites on this album. It has really thought provoking lyrics and and musically this song is awesome!<BR>Let you down, this song is good but it's really mellow and slow.<BR>Lie In Our Graves, this is the song that really got me hooked on the dmb. It starts out uptempo and in the middle slows down a bit then it picks up at the end and makes for one amazing song.<BR>Cry Freedom, This song is very good war cry type song.<br />Tripping Billies, This is an older dmb song that was released on remember two things as a live song and the band decided to put it on here. It's kinda out of place on this album but it's still a very good upbeat song.<BR>Proudest Monkey, an 8 minute masterpiece! I absolutely love this song!! Leroi has a great sax solo and the guy's musical talents really shine on this song. Has great lyrics also.<br />So if you haven't figured out already, I highly reccomend this album!
B00003CX8U|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released in the late seventies and thought it was ahead of it's time.  The music and choreography is outstanding.  It was edgy then and it's still edgy today.<br />If imitation is the best form of flattery then you will see that quite a few music video's got their ideas about dancing and music from this film.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Unlike some movies who on the surface seem to be suitable for children (Shrek) Monsters Inc is truly a kid's movie.  There was no humor that would be unsuitable for small children; even better there are enough humorous scenes and jokes that adults can also have some laughs.  Overall the movie is very funny and very sweet.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Despite what some others have said, I think this is a really good movie. It's got great action sequences, unbelivable art direction, costumes, and sets. And the story I found to be engaging and fairly complex for what's supposedly a &quot;kids movie&quot;. The podrace is perhaps the best action sequence in any movie ever, making the chariot race in Ben Hur look like a Sunday stroll through the park. <br />The DVD has tons of extras, very well produced and the video and sound quality are excellent as is to be expected from Lucas and friends. I highly reccomend this DVD.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have to say i was more then surprised by this album. I liked Incubus and all but thought they were a run of the mill band. What I sae is the best album of 2001.<BR>This album sets them Apart from the other \\"nu-metal\\" bands. Only Incubus, System of a Down, and Korn have survived that generation and Incubus is the strongest of all three. I'll take you by it song by song.<br />1. Nice to know you- this song sets the tone. It's a classic Incubus style song with a little bit more flava from there DJ.<br />2. Circles- one of the heavier songs of the cd. An awsome blend of soft and hard vocals by Brandon here.<br />3. Wish you were here- This song is the \\"big hit\\" off the cd. It's not the strongest track but it is one of there better songs.<br />4. Just a phase- My personal favroite. The band shows there skills in the beginning and then Brandon just blows you away with his vocals.<br />5. 11am- Awsome song. More simple then the rest but also very reflective and nice.<br />6. Blood on the Ground- This song shows the maturity of the band.<br />Lyrics make you think about everything going on and it comes of flawless.<br />7. Mexico- It Can't be Incubus without the ballad. This song is an Acoustic song and shows there depth. <br />8. Warning- The CD takes a Tramatic turn here showing a new side and whole a diffrent sound thats incredible. Another song that makes u think.<br />9. Echo- This song grew on me with time...it is now a favroite of mine.<br />10. Have you Ever- Funky song...takes me back to there Fungous Amugous days. Again more awsome riff's. The Band sounds flawless.<br />11. Are you in?- 2nd best song on the Track. It's funky and fresh and offers a little bit more DJ flavor.<br />12. Under my umbrella- A heavier song that really is one of those concert songs u let everything out at. Great song.<br />13. Adeqous Transmission- What a song here its amazing. Nothing on any CD touches this song. It's the future of music. Best song by incubus ever.
0930289455|5.0|This chapter in the Dark Knight's life was as grim as the events which spawned him. There is death and rebirth here - the Joker's history, Birth of Oracle and a wake-up call for the Hollywood writers of BATMAN: Year One.!!!
B00000I07P|5.0|This album (as well as all Bon Jovi albums) kicks...  big style. Not only is Livin' On A Prayer the best song ever written but the over 9 on this album are also the best rock songs and ballads on the planet. Bon Jovi rules and ain't nobody gonna tell me different.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Cool, esp being one of the first to see Spidey in the world. A great way to spend Labor Day eve !<br />Tobey Mcguire great as usual gives us the sensitive side to any cartoon character.Former Ang Lee prodigy even kicks ass in Crouching Tiger/Matrix style action.<br />The social comments are subtle including the comment amount the state of worldwide unemployment when Uncle Ben was retrenched.<BR>The semi cartoon like action of Spidey and The Green Goblin is a reminder of the surreal visuals seen in Dick Tracy which won an Oscar for cinematography.<br />Spidey is both entertaining and intelligent. Don't miss it !
B000002I7R|4.0|PICTURES AT ELEVEN is a must for the person wishing to find out about Robert Plant, post Led Zeppelin. His 1st solo effort is refreshing and bridges 1970's monster rock with a more progessive 1980's sound. Although Robert's voice is not the same as it was when he was a strapping 20-23 year old, he still has his moments. BURNING DOWN ONE SIDE was the 1st single I heard from the album in 82' and it unfortunately showcases the increased limitations of Robert's vocal range. He sounds strained and the song is too herky jerky, but, albeit listenable. MOONLIGHT IN SAMOSA is one of Robert's best solo pieces with beautiful Spanish guitar work by Robbie Blunt and a nice baratone vocal which has suited Robert well in his later years. PLEDGE PIN is Robert's jump into the 1980's. Very Un-Zep, it's a peppy pop-rock tune with more fine guitar work. A great example of how Robert has really been overlooked for his courage to jump out and experiment. Robert's major nod to his past is SLOW DANCER, which could have been on \\"Physical Graffiti\\". It's hypnotizing Indian riff and pounding drums take you to another place, plus it is around 9 minutes long. WORSE THAN DETROIT is probably the worst song on the album. A \\"B\\" side shmaltzy throw-away. FAT LIP finds Robert straining to hit or hold onto the higher notes again. LIKE I'VE NEVER BEEN GONE is a hidden near-masterpiece. Gorgeously haunting, there is no escuse for this song never getting attention or radio play. It would have fit nicely on \\"In Through the Out Door\\" and would have been a Zep classic had it been. Again, Robert's voice heads downward where  it's most comfortable. MYSTERY TITLE sounds like something that was a throw-away from \\"Presence\\", but, has a few good moments.  The ringing endorsement I have for PICTURES AT ELEVEN is that  I've listened to it hundreds of times and never grown tired of it. Despite it's flaws!!!
B00004U2G4|5.0|I'm surprised no one mentions the best song in the album... \\"Morning Dew\\"!!!. This is the best version ever. The screaming guitar by Beck and the intense, emotional bluesy voice by Rod Steward make it impossible to match. One the best songs of Rock history. If this song leaves you cold, stay out of Rock & Blues.
B00004X0ER|5.0|To quote the mighty Oasis, God gave me this rock and roll.  A year ago, music seemed dead, done, over.  Now we've got the Hives, the Strokes, the White Stripes, the Vines, the (International) Noise Conspiracy.  It hasn't been this good since the glory days of Britpop (Definitely Maybe, Parklife, the Bends, Northern Soul, In It for the Money) or the dying days of grunge (Vs., In Utero, Purple, Superunknown, Jar of Flies, Siamese Dream).  But forget about the past.  Let's enjoy the Hives.  Who knew the Swedes could produce anything other than beautiful blond honeys?  So what does the music sound like?  It's hard to say.  Comparisons always do both bands a disfavor.  But it's exciting, it's raw, it's packed with killer riffs and I swear that the lead singer Pelle sometimes is channeling John Lennon (Twist and Shout but even more lacerated).  The lyrics are daft but in a way that somehow makes sense.  I'm looking forward to seeing them live.  If they're anywhere as good as the Strokes were, it's a show to see.
B000003N7R|5.0|...and these two legends of their own time done amassed it all into this one 35-minute recording.  A collaboration like this is, well, basically, the stuff dreams are made of.  And this is the cool and calculated nightclub album that all the newly-open ears to jazz are looking for.  When you take Duke Ellington, possibly the single most important figure in jazz history, give him a set list of his own classic standards, then have him handling all the piano parts and such, then place him alongside one of the most popular and rule-changing jazz ensembles of the day, the John Coltrane Quartet, headed by the inimitable Coltrane saxophone, as well as having Ellington's own bassist Aaron Bell and drummer Sam Woodyard sit in on the sessions.  Ohhh, baby, you done mixed a drink that's gonna make everybody in the bar smile.  These recordings are just purely respectful to the original compositions and masterfully-performed.  When you hear John take on an old 1940s Ellington standard like 'In a Sentimental Mood', all them World War II veterans that were gettin' on in their years must've been proud of the young saxophonist.  But, as most others have mentioned, absolutely nothing tops the interpretation of Billy Strayhorn's 'My Little Brown Book'.  It will just absolutely move you to tears.  It's cool, it's sophisticated, it'll make you sweat and the build-up and movement of the lines Coltrane plays go down perfectly.  Even more perfectly when coupled with some cognac.  This is just not something any jazz fan or Coltrane completist or Ellington historian, or whatever you are, should be without.  I rank it among my Top 5 favorite jazz recordings, truth be told.  So that right there should be enough to peak your curiosity.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Hits disturbingly close to home, and so I watch it at least once a month, usually late at night after consuming a six pack of porter. Best enjoyed uninterupted in the dark. The whole cast is great, but Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter really shine. Plus, anything that keeps Meat Loaf from making more albums is total bonus.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn were good, but this CD is great.  I'm disgusted with all the music snobs out there that think that a band has to be obscure to be good, and as soon as they've become successful they've sold out.  Total BS.  This is No Doubt's best album.  Every song on this CD is good.  The Prince collaboration, Waiting Room, is my least favorite.  But everything Gwen wrote is superb.  Ignore the whining [people] and buy this CD.
0783217048|5.0|i love john leguizamos acting. hes always funny. i like the idea of drag queens. this is easilly compared to another movie with guys dressing up as girls sorority boys. its the funniest movie ever.

B00005JKL8|5.0|this was a way cool movie. even for teenagers like myself. its about a guy who is about to quit the navy due to lack of excitement but gene hackman hires him on a mission into bosnia his plane gets shot down and his partner is killed. this is very exciting and action packed.
B00005OAIE|5.0|When I first heard the single on the radio ,I thought MMM , sounds like Go West has another hit, to my surprise it's not Go West at all but John Mayer .<BR>Also caught him on a late night TV show but did not know who this was.<BR>He was singing No Such Thing , this song is great it stuck with me for about a week, then I heard it on the radio, now I'm hooked and have to have this CD .<BR>Lot's of talent here have not seen if he has anything else but I'll check it out.<BR>Over all a great relese for this talent, hopefully more to come.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is, without doubt, the crown jewel of the Disney collection. There isn't a frame in this movie that isn't gorgeous, and the storytelling is Disney at his best; truly timeless. This is an absolute must-have for any Disney fan or anyone with young children.
B000001FW9|3.0|Make that 3+1/2 stars. I disagree with another reviewer or two: GG here is just coming off as the fine progressive band they were destined to become. In fact, maybe the perfect overall prog band. The complexity here sounds in-place to me, maybe just not as excitingly propelled as their later albums. This one may well be better than THREE FRIENDS.
0451527712|4.0|Among the many themes of Frankenstein, one of them is that of friendship, ambition, and the conflict between the two.  The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship.<br />Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to \\"benefit all mankind\\" with his scientific project.  His \\"selfless\\" ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father.  In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a \\"most severe evil.\\"  Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society.  His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat.  Likewise, this is where Victor's ambition leads him when he's hunting down the monster in futility.  The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.<br />Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results.  As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project.  The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night.  Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none and which is the very thing that turned him from good to evil.  While observing an impoverished family, \\"the bitter gall of envy\\" arose in the monster.  He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty.  When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race,  the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed.  The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great , if not the greatest, need for man.<br /> I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive.  At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort.  Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our \\"native town to be the world,\\" he adds, \\"yet another may succeed.\\"  You could interpret this as Victor not \\"learning his lesson;\\" that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions.  Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous.  After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be hypocrisy.though they are in financial poverty.

B00005QDW5|3.0|I would really give this collection 3 1/2 stars for the inclusion of a lot of top-notch Floyd songs, and the fact that somehow the edits make the songs flow pretty well from one to another.  I have a major problem with certain songs selected, however.  <br />The songs chosen from the band's &quot;Classic&quot; period are hard to argue with: One of These Days and Echoes from Meddle; Time, Money, Great Gig and Us &amp; Them from DSOTM; Shine On and the title track from WYWH; Sheep from Animals; and Another Brick, Hey You and Comfortably Numb from The Wall (I don't really think of Happiest days as a song - it's more like a segue).  My only complaints here: &quot;Dogs&quot; is one of their best tunes, and was passed over because of length issues...and God only knows why &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; was excluded.<br />Though I'm not really a Syd Barrett-era Floyd fan, I realize the significance of that era's music and the necessity of including a good number of Barrett songs.  Of the five included here, the only one I really don't care for is Jugband Blues.  I think they would have been better off including another one of the early singles, or maybe another track from Piper.  Also: two tracks chosen from Saucerful of Secrets, but none from Atom Heart Mother or Obscured by Clouds?  There's something wrong there.<br />What really steams me about this collection are the choices for the Gilmour-era songs.  The five songs included here are High Hopes, Marooned, Sorrow, Learning to Fly, and Keep Talking.  Alright, High Hopes is a terrific and powerful song, and well worth having; Learning to Fly is one of the better songs from the sub-par Momentary Lapse.  However, besides High Hopes, the very best songs from this era of Floyd are not represented on this collection: &quot;On the Turning Away,&quot; &quot;Poles Apart&quot; (an incredibly underrated song from Division Bell), &quot;Coming Back to Life,&quot; and &quot;Take it Back&quot; all completely outclass most of the Gilmour material included here.  Marooned?  I don't care if it won one grammy or 10 grammies...it's still a boring, pointless song.  And Keep Talking?  That pick really gets me...that may be the single worst Gilmour-Floyd song.  <br />Rounding out the set, we have a random Final Cut song that seems out of place, and When the Tigers Broke Free, which is basically included for the sole purpose of attracting hardcores who already own all the cd's.  It's an average song: there's a reason why it was left off The Wall in the first place.<br />All in all, I suppose this compilation does serve its purpose for the average fan.  It does include the overall best songs from the best era of the band.  At the very least, they did make it two discs, and including Echoes (the song) was a good move.  That notwithstanding, the collection could have been rounded out a bit better.  Some songs have no right to be called &quot;the best of Pink Floyd.&quot;
6301978137|4.0|I used to love this movie when I was a kid! Yes, the acting's  dreadful, but it had a wonderful score by Ennio Morricone, good cinematography & larger than life sets. A classic story of Sword-and-Sorcery. Sanadahl Bergman is fun as the evil Queen Gedren.
B000003TA4|5.0|That I should be saying anything about this album seems ridiculous. If you're looking at the reviews that people have written, it's probably because you are bored. There is nothing I could say that hasn't already been said before.<br />Let me not shy away from it:<br />This is the most important album from the 90's. It influenced everything that you hear today. Go, turn on your radio, chances are you will hear a song from the album on some station right now. If not you will hear a band/song that was influenced by this album. It's just like throwing a rock in the air, you cannot help but to hit the ground (find a song influenced, that is).<br />Now that that's out of the way, there is nothing really left to say except this: oh yeah, and it rocks too. People like to say 'oh this album was sooooo influential' and then it stinks. Listen to 'the Wall' when you're not stoned sometime, see if you feel the same. This album actually sounds good though, from start to finish. There are no breaks, there's nothing boring hiding on track 9. There's no annoying stuff on track 5. It rocks, from start to finish.<br />Bottom line: if you do not own this album, you should go check out MC Hammer, cause chances are if you don't own this album, you're stuck in the year before it came out. BUY IT NOW.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is such a refreshing cd.  I'm one of those hard to please people.  Most of the time I purchase a cd and like one or two tracks.  This cd kept me listening throughout, that's a major accomplishment in my book.  Looks like this will be part of my summer 2002 soundtrack.  I can't wait to play it loud outside......Thank God for Aware/Columbia for signing him and thank you John Mayer for this wonderful cd!  I want more!

If you want the best exprience go in with a blank mind and let the movie paint the picture. I give it three thumbs up. Be perpared for a Spiderman 2, it will be coming.
B00005QDW1|4.0|People, people. Me thinks you protest too much. This CD is aptly named because it rocks steady from beginning to end. At first listen, I wasn't convinced, but as I savored individual tracks starting with the great \\"Underneath it All,\\" I discovered that there's lots to dig about this album. First and foremost, \\"Underneath it All,\\" produced by Sly and Robbie of Jamaican renown, is one of the best reggae tracks I've heard in decades. Gwen and company have single-handedly resurrected the top-of-the-pops in reggae with this wonderful tune. I just love this song, and here in Hawaii it is a BIG hit! (Take note No Doubt, this is your next single, trust me!...) I especially like the female Jah rapper mid-song on \\"Underneath It All.\\" Whoa, great stuff. And Gwen really stirs up a lot of heartfelt soul on this track. (I completely and totally disagree with a previous reviewer who thinks this song is from the ska Specials genre. It's nothing of the sort. It's pure reggae with a love connection a la Dennis Brown, Gregory Isaacs or the Mightly Diamonds.) <br />The next track, #6, is a rockin' good time, followed by track #7 which also has many moments of mojo, along with \\"Hella Good\\" which is kicking major ... on VH1 as we speak. \\"Inside My Head\\" is another reggae-tinged tune with fabulous lyrics.  Sure there are moments of pop/new wave synthesizer horror at first listen on some of these tracks. I was put off at first, myself.  But because I've given this album a fighting chance and many a spin, I can tell you that there's plenty to like about it.  And ya gotta give them credit for not sticking to the same formula.  Every No Doubt album is different from the previous.  And for those who loved \\"Tragic Kingdom,\\" just remember, there were plenty of die-hard local OC fans who were skeptical when that album first came out, accusing the band of selling out or whatever. <br />Gwen is a class act and a real talent. Kudos to Tony Kanal for laying down some AWESOME bass lines that quite simply, rock steady.
B00005JKEC|5.0|Fasten your seat belt when you watch Training Day. Within minutes after it starts Training Day is dominated by Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance as Officer<br />Alonzo Harris. Take a deep breath (you'll need it) and get ready to watch a film peppered with non-stop action, gritty settings, escalating violence, and surprising plot twists. Directed at break-neck pace by Antoine Fuqua,  Training Day has flaws (some plot holes and coincidences), but it works due to Washington's type-shattering performance.<br />  Let's face it: if ever Hollywood had a \\"good guy\\" who audiences LIKED because he seemed like an old friend and NICE guy, it has been Denzel Washington. Forget all the press hype about political and personal factors influencing the Oscar vote: when you see Training Day you'll witness evil incarnate as you watch Washington's portrayal of the corrupt, manipulative and brutal Officer Harris -- providing evidence beyond a doubt that Washington is one of today's greatest actors.<br />  The setting is Los Angeles (one of the biggest stars of this movie) where crooked narc Harris must train his new rookie, star-eyed partner, Jake, played by  Ethan Hawke in a career-boosting role. Hawke creates the perfect conscience-ridden counterpoint to Washington's amoral, immoral Harris. Indeed, Hawke's finely-tuned performance, making Jake increasingly sympathetic and complex,  provides a glaring context for Harris' evil.<br />  Bit by bit, the naive, idealistic Jake is shoved down and force-fed street-reality by the cynical, sociopathic Harris. You can literally feel Hawke's rookie struggling with how criminal and law enforcement distinctions increasingly blur. By the end of this film, Jake seems \\"older\\" while the steely Harris' seems a mere street thug...but get ready for some surprises.<br />  Aside from Washington's and Hawke's on-the-edge performances, Training Day boasts several jarring and highly satisfying plot twists. Don't expect a mere police drama<br />with lots of chases, screeching tires and nothing more. Training Day takes the violent, gritty police-and-mean-streets genre to an entirely new level -- while Washington propels his acting into the artistic stratosphere.mere police drama<BR>with lots of chases, screeching tires and nothing more.

0451527712|4.0|Frankenstein contains themes relating to Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis. Freud placed a high value on interpreting dreams for psychological insight.  Right after Victor brought his creation to life and realized he made an abomination, the scientist raced to his bedroom and finally fell into a troubled sleep, but awakened \\"disturbed by the wildest dreams.\\"  He dreamt that he saw his fiance Elizabeth and as he kissed her he beheld the corpse of his mother in his arms.  He delayed his marriage to Elizabeth to create the monster, and passively allowed the monster to kill her on their wedding night.  Victor's troubles began in college when his mother died and he rebelled against his father by reading books that he forbade Victor to read.  Psychoanalysis might determine of Victor that he inwardly struggles with the \\"Oedipus Conflict\\" in which, as Freud established, children develop their first sexual desire for their parent of the opposite sex and therefore have hostility towards the other parent.<br />Freud also contended that anxiety arises from \\"libido\\", or repressed sexual and aggessive desires.  Indeed, Victor's anxiety of the monster on his wedding night is parallel with his anticipation of marriage to Elizabeth.  As stated earlier, Victor even postponed his marriage to create the monster which would later kill his bride on their untried marriage bed.  Freud said that each person has an aspect of themself, which he called the \\"Id\\", that contains antisocial desires which we repress and as libidinal forces, constantly seek expression in distorted, concealed ways.  Freudians might say that the monster symbolizes the Id of Frankenstein, that hidden aspect of himself which violently desires to destroy all that he loves. The monster's ugliness fits well with representing this ugly aspect of Victor.  The monster and Frankenstein are bound together as one.  When Victor finally dies, the monster, too dies.  The two hated each other passionately and each made it his life to end the life of the other.  Freud said that \\"forgetting\\" is often motivated by a subconscious desire to repress some painful memory; but all that we repress seeks expression in all sorts of symptoms.  After Victor abandoned the monster, he acted in such oblivion to his creation.  But, like painful memories repressed, the monster would reappear very ugly in Victor's life and ardently express his fury.  Victor tried to repress and control the monster only to find the monster controls him.  Similar themes arise in \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"his life to end the life of the other.

0517122707|5.0|Simply put, this is a very funny book.  I rarely laugh out loud when the joke is auditory or even visual, but this book just killed me.  So, buy it already.  Or borrow it from a friend.  Or from the library.  Just read it.  Now.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies made. Along with &quot;The Last Days Of Patton&quot; they make a great gift and also an educational item. If you never have seen this movie, you're missing a great story.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Well, before everyone starts clicking the 'no, this was not helpful' button, keep in mind this is only a review for the Two Towers TRAILOR, which I am writing since my *extreme* impatience for December 2002 means I have to occupy myself in various ways.<BR>As most people should know, a special preview (about four minutes long) for the Two Towers is now tagged on to the end of The Fellowship of the Ring. This preview is a wonderful look at what to expect in the next Lord of the Rings movie, and creates enough excitement and suspense that it's like your seeing the entire movie condensed into a few seconds.<br />Whether you're rushing off to buy a movie ticket, or dismissing me as a Tolkien geek, keep in mind that I am new to the world of Tolkien - I have not yet read 'The Two Towers' or 'Return of the King', but am still enthusiastic and excited about Peter Jackson's work and am sure neither the movies nor the books will disappoint...<BR> <BR>A noticeable difference that already exists between 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' is that there is much more action taking place within cities and towns - more people, larger sets, bigger special effects. Just by watching the trailor one can see that 'The Two Towers' will eclipse the 'Fellowship' in terms of scale, which seems inconcievable given the huge scope of the 'Fellowship of the Ring'.  <br />My impression of the preview was that it seemed to centre mostly around Aragorn - there was surprisingly little of Frodo. It took the time to re-establish the characters, taking off with what they all were doing at the end of the 'Fellowship of the Ring'- Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli tracking the abducted Merry and Pippen, and Sam and Frodo travelling through the desolate land of Mordor. <br />At one stage the trio of Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn turn around to attack someone behind them only to see - Gandalf! Yup, when Peter Jackson took suggestions from the fans as to what they wanted to see in the trailor, top of the list was Gandalf the White. Gandalf now sports a Sauruman hairstyle, and on the whole appears more powerful, more aloof.<BR>Another highlight includes Pippen unknowingly climbing up an ent (a talking tree) which blinks an eye at him. Pippen leans down to call something to Merry, without realising he's just seen an eye in a tree before realisation hits him and his eyes widen in shock. <br />As well as the ents, there are shots of other new characters - Theoden, Eomer, Faramir, Wormtongue and quite a few of the maiden Eowyn, who falls in love with Aragorn and follows him into battle. Her shots are especially beautiful - one of her weeping, smiling, riding a horse across a plain, sparring determinely with Aragorn and shattering his sword, touching someone's face with tears in her eyes, running towards us up a flight of stairs, and a beautiful pan-back of her on the parapets of Endoras, the banners flapping in the breeze. This is New Zealand scenery at it's best. <BR>Familiar characters include Arwen, Sauruman, and a grave Galadriel who tells someone off-screen - \\"There is nothing more we can do for Frodo. The quest will claim his life.\\"<BR>But the climax is the truely awe-inspiring and downright scary battle at Helms Deep. Rows upon rows of orcs roar and thump their weapons upon their shields at an army of men under a night sky in the pouring rain. Arrows fly through the air, ladders are pushed up against the walls of the citadel - chaos is everywhere. Never has a trailor sped my pulse up so much.<BR>  <BR>And then the finale - a misshapen, deformed Gollum crawling headfirst down a vertical cliff towards a sleeping Frodo and Sam, hissing - 'The filtttthy tttthievesss. They've taken our preecioussss and we wantsss it!' Frodo wakes up with a gasp before the black out.<br />So is it worth going to see the 'Fellowship' again to see this preview? Yes, it is. It will leave you exhilirated and anticipating 'The Two Towers' more than ever.
B00005U122|5.0|Buy it, it has good quality video and it was well recorded in 5.1<BR>Good music too.
B00005JKJA|2.0|It's movies like these that ruin it for the rest. David Lynch brings us another story that should make sense but screws you over for the 45 minutes. The movie was good for the first 90 minutes(believe it or not), but it seems as if this wierdo director tries to confuse his audiences so that they'll end up thinking that it is good and then they'll buy it. Not only that but this is an absolutely horrible DVD release. Only a trailer and Cast & Crew info! This also has to be a first for a DVD that doesn't have any chapter stops. I heard Lynch purposely did that and will be doing it for all of his other movies. The 3-second car crash is all that I enjoyed. If you liked this hunk-o-junk then see Lost Highway, it's basically the same Lynch [stuff].
B00003CXZ1|5.0|By far, the best scene in the movie, although it is quite a good adventure movie true to the game. I enjoyed it for just a little excitement.
B00004YZT5|3.0|Poison has had the reputation and in 2002 maintains the reputation of being one of America's very best party metal bands. However, part of that image is thanks to the larger than life guitar player CC Deville who assisted in setting the world on fire with the boys of Poison. However, CC and the rest of Poison had a massive falling out and this is Poison's very first studio recording session released without CC playing the six string. What is Poison like without Mr. Deville?<br />Well, that's not quite and open and shut case. This album was released right in the middle of the depressing grunge era that still makes me scratch my head in wonderment on just what that was all about. Though this album is not anywhere near the outright obnoxiously monotonous style of grunge, it is not quite as good as Poison's recordings from 3 years later, also without CC, on Crack a Smile. <br />The single off this album, \\"Stand\\" gained a lot of critical acclaim in it's day with an almost gospel sounding overtone and some of the style that made Poison a household name. However, the style of Poison is lost through most of this album and a strange mix of sounds results in a mixed up fan base which is never good. <br />There are a few other bright spots on the album beyond Stand though. Stay Alive is a very well produced and performed song. I've often remarked on my own Heavy Metal website that Stay Alive should have been the album's single. What can you do about that almost ten years after it's initial release, though?<br />Without airing any dirty laundry that needs no further discussion about Ricki Rockett's wife and the, politely put, brainless and talentless toad that took CC's place for this album, the scandal does wear on your mind and due to loyalty, most Poison fans attempt to forget this album due to the actions of the toad. Through no fault of the true Poison crew, this album is not their best.
B000002KBU|5.0|Make no mistake about it. Joni Mitchell's &quot;Blue&quot; will stay under your skin once you hear it. Songs like &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot;, &quot;Little Green&quot;, and &quot;Blue&quot;, are intense both lyrically and musically along with Joni's fragile vocals. &quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;Carey&quot;, and &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; are so beautiful and true to human emotion that one can't help but keep them in their hearts. &quot;My Old Man&quot;, &quot;River&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, and &quot;A Case Of You&quot; are poetic gems that make one remember the one that got away. All these songs are classics that no music lover should be without. I know many albums lose a lot of their original power and intensity with time, but Blue to this day, like one reviewer said, remains a watershed.
B000003TA4|1.0|I grew up during the quote unquote &quot;changing of the guard&quot; in Rock history and was subject to remarks by so called music aficionados claiming this type of sound and this band would last for at least 25 years. Thankfully to all those who have the good fortune of having good hearing, those days are over and easily forgotten.<br />A depressing sound by a depressing band that accentually devolved due to a not surprising successful suicide attempt by the &quot;bands&quot; &quot;lead singer,&quot; Nirvana was nothing more than the discontent version of the modern day boy bands because neither band really play instruments, as word of that fact has gotten out among the Metal heads like myself, and neither have very much of a concept as to what they are even talking about. <br />From the drones of the guitar that may or may not have been played by a member of the band and the uncreative half-effort &quot;singing&quot; by Kurt, it's a wonder, and I mean a wonder that has had me scratching my head all night several nights, that people actually like music like this. I sure do not appreciate it at all and truth be told, I never will. I've always liked a smile or an anthem to get my fist pumping. Not a monotonous drone that makes me stamp my feet, the very feet I will spend the rest of my life staring down at from the depression that Nirvana fans &quot;felt&quot; because MTV told them to feel it. This is forgettable music by an already forgotten band and a long diseased genre and this is one of the most important reasons that rock music as we know and knew it is still having a hard time getting back on the map. You don't have to agree with that statement, but the facts back it up.
B00004Z400|5.0|The Deftones are one of those bands that has become a victim of its own success (and fans). Too often, they're grouped in with the current wave of rap/metal bands polluting the airwaves and MTV. On the contrary, the only thing that the Deftones share in common with bands like Korn, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit is their fanbase. &quot;The White Pony&quot; demonstrates why this band deserves a second look from critics and fans alike.<br />Although this is really a rock album at heart, there is much diverstiy among the songs on this disc. &quot;Elite&quot; and &quot;Street Carp&quot; showcase the Deftones roots in hard rock, as both tracks are relatively straightforward and guitar-driven. On the other hand, there's the acoustic &quot;Teenager&quot; and drum loop-heavy &quot;RX Queen&quot;. There are also more experimental tracks like &quot;Passenger&quot;, which features Maynard James Keenan of Tool (another band that's often misjudged in critical circles) sharing vocal duties. This song and &quot;The Boy's Republic&quot; (a track that, unforunately, is only available on the limited-edition version of the album) are the two standouts on a disc with few low points.<br />The rest of the album is populated with groovy, slower paced (yet still heavy) tracks like &quot;Change&quot;, the first single from the disc. Most of these songs, if released by another band that was marketed differently, would probably appeal to many indie and college rock fans. In fact, despite my admittedly eclectic tastes, this is probably the album that's spent the most time in my cd player all summer. &quot;The White Pony&quot; serves as both a guilty pleasure for indie rock eletists and perhaps a gateway to better music for rap/metal fans. Definitely Recommended.
B00000I07R|4.0|For years I had read reviews and heard the gossip among friends about Bon Jovi's &quot;bad&quot; material. They would point to Keep the Faith and Jon's solo material and claim it to be very pop-rock with no attitude or style that brought the band to prominence during the glam metal insurgence in the mid to late 1980's. Well, I finally gathered up the nerve and picked up Bon Jovi's &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; and will judge their performance for myself completely free of prior interpretation.<br />Keep the Faith, the title track, should have been the open for the album. While I. Believe is a solid song, it does reflect the previous thoughts shared by friends and fellow reviewers. Though I feel the live performance on the 2001 video and CD release of One Wild Night was more energetic, the studio version does have a lot more of the attitude that I base my favorite bands' grander upon. From there, other strong songs like I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, Blame it on the Love of Rock and Roll, and one of the best ballads of any band in history, Bed of Roses, carry the album from the grasp of negative reviews for me.<br />While some songs don't seem to make very much sense to me and others fall flat, more than not the album is a true Bon Jovi album. I do feel the attitude of the band was toned down quite a bit from their release of New Jersey and Slippery When Wet but the style that is the band remains strong. Also, it is important to keep in mind the release of this album was in the height of the down sounding and down right depressing drones of the extremely forgettable and disposable grunge rock scene. The fact that this album is something you can listen to without wanting to cause yourself physical harm makes it a stand out from this time in popular music. Overall, it's a good buy but not sure as good as New Jersey.
B00004XONN|5.0|Often times, when a band releases an album that is both commercially successful and widely acclaimed by critics, they spend the remainder of their career trying to imitate it and duplicate that success. One would think that after releasing an album like 1997's OK Computer (which was named &quot;album of the year&quot; by many), Radiohead would follow such a path. Instead, with Kid A they've taken another leap forward and yet again solidify themselves as one of the most important bands around today. I know, these are some pretty heavy words but, really, this is one great album.<br />Upon first listen, the album is difficult to digest. The title of the first track, &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; seems like a misnomer -- nothing seems to be right, especially this first track. The song lacks any sort of traditional structure and just doesn't seem to fit together. This unsettling mood continues throughout the album. The title track features almost completely incomprehensible vocals that are at times indiscernible from the synthesizers and other noises that flow throughout the track. &quot;The National Anthem&quot; is one of the most bizarre songs on the album -- what starts out like a fairly normal Radiohead rock song takes an abrupt turn into a series of horn solos and choruses. Other strange moments include the Brian Eno-esque ambient interlude &quot;Treefingers&quot;, beats in &quot;Idioteque&quot; that sound straight out of an Autechre song and even some harp playing in &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.<br />After first listening to this album, I was sort of overwhelmed by all of the strangeness, but after the second or third listen, everything started to &quot;click&quot;. Kid A has a very strangely appealing quality to it, almost reminiscent of, dare I say, the Beatles. Indeed, once you &quot;get&quot; this album, everything does seem to be in its right place and it goes from being appealing to downright addictive. After I first got this album, it didn't leave my CD player for a good 3 or 4 days. After many repeated listenings, I'm still not sick of it.<br />Forgetting all of the weirdness for a minute, there are a few tracks on this disc that will appeal to the casual Radiohead fan. &quot;Optimistic&quot;, the moog-flavored first single from the album, is definitely the standout, but songs like &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; could probably succeed on commercial radio as well. Despite their appealing nature, however, these songs do feature some of the same quirkiness as the more experimental tracks. It's the successful combination of these two types of styles -- eccentric and appealing -- that make this album truly unique.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|Not having seen ALI on the big screen, I am confined to the letter box mini-vision of the DVD. Maybe that is one of the reasons this movie just doesn't come across. It is long, takes forever to get started, promises a great story, but delivers very little of the life of the title character.  Yes, the assassination of Malcom X is arresting, yes, the footwork in the ring is well photographed, yes, the makeup artists created a wax figure of Howard Cosell out of Jon Voight's face.  But this film seems to be about a man in retrospect, which leaves out all the wonderful madness that made Ali such a vibrantly alive figure.  Too much is just left out (the first wife beautifully protrayed by Jada Pickett Smith just drops out of sight without any explanation, the &quot;beginnings of Rap&quot; are ignored, the blustery buffoonery of a really charismatic man is dusted under the carpet), as though we are only to see Ali as the second coming of Christ.  Overly long, poorly edited, this slight film just goes on and on and on.......
B00004SCBG|4.0|I don't like Fripp as a personnality ; however, the composer is great, and &quot;Lizard&quot; remains to me the best proof of that fact. The sound of this album is colorful, with that wonderful brass and woodwinds ensemble ; Fripp's guitar sounds clear and is sharp. &quot;Cirkus&quot; is a good opening track, with a stunning burst of mellotron after its peculiarly slight beginning. &quot;Indoor games&quot; is a witty and strange song, full of mood changes : funny intro, aggressive voice and some still solo passages. &quot;Happy family&quot; is a little bit messy, but its child-song melody is pretty interesting. The two last songs of the album are fantastic gems, &quot;Lizard&quot; being a wonderfully brightly built suite. The big mistake in this album is the very bad voice of Haskell : too rough, dissonant in that kind of context. The drummer is a laugh : he's a very good one, but Mike Giles' departure is audible : I always think when I listen to this record : &quot;Fripp asked that guy -- Hey ! please try and play like Mike Giles !&quot; Off course Giles, being the best drummer of all time, is unique : you can't replace him. By the way, the album he recorded with McDonald while &quot;Lizard&quot; was recorded is a splendid one -- although it suffers from the lack of means the musicians had ; but they made it, and I love it too ! I highly recommend this limited-edition of &quot;Lizard&quot; because, apart from the beautiffuly restored cover art, one can have the satisfaction to hear a truly PERFECT sound.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I just saw the movie yesterday and it's great! I'm not a comic fan so I don't know how closely the movie follows the actual comic. This movie tells the story of how Peter Parker, a nerdy (and therefore smart) kid, turns into Spiderman, the (probably still) smart, cool hero. Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman because he looks good. I don't know- is it Tobey Maguire in the Spiderman suit too? Or is it a stuntman. Well whoever it is in there looks nice as well. The conflicts within Peter/Spiderman are also conveyed, as well as the \\"gift or curse\\" aspect. The special effects are really great to watch, probably the best part of the movie. It's just a really fun movie, especially the \\"swing from building to building\\" and the \\"launching spider webs\\" parts. Go see it for great entertainment!

B00005YXZH|5.0|This album has to be ranked in the top ten of all time!  As long time fan of alt-county I feel like this album it true to its roots but with exceptional creativity, well crafted songs, electronic sonic wizardry and pure love this album revolutionizes the genre.  It is a must buy!
B000002MP2|5.0|I've got nearly all of the Green Day albums, and this one is by far my fav. My fav track is Pulling Teeth, great vocals by Billie, exellent drums by tre and brill bass by Mike. If U skip to around 4 minutes and 20 secs there's a hidden track, at first I didn't get it but after the third time it's great! The Last track (F.O.D) starts off as a nice acoustic track and turns into great raw punk! An all round brill album with great Green Day classics such as: Basket Case, When I Come Around, Longview, Welcome to Paradise and She. So a must-have for any Green Day Fan.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|It appears EVH and DLR followed Robert Johnson's footsteps when he went to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil in exchange for becoming the greatest blues artist ever.  EVH & DLR MUST have done the same thing before recording \\"Fair Warning\\"--an album so perfect 5 stars does it no justice.  FW is, hands down, the true essence of rock and roll.

I didnt think i could learn that much information from one book.<BR>It really gives you a bases of understanding of philosophy.  With intresting analogys continuing mysterys and people always letting things &quot;slip&quot; it keeps you reading. They only thing i was dissapointed with was the ending. It seemed cut short and unfinished.

B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is now my new favorite band. I first discovered there music when I went ot a small lil concert at IONA College In NEw Rochelle NY. The seocnd opening act, Simple Plan, blew me away, with music stylings lke Blink 182 and Good Charlotte they jumped up and own on the stage wioth there guitars getting the crowd pumped up for the main act, Sugar Ray. I bought there CD at the cocnert and I was luckly enoguh to get to meet the band and get them to sing it. I also got to take pics with them and get to meet the whole band. When I went home that night(actually it was techinaclly the next mornign..but ya know) and i put the cd in as I tried ot fall asleep. Lewtme tell you, I could deifnalty not fall asleep cause the music was too good. If you like punk or pop or rock you'll definalty love this CD so check it out (or else!)
B000002549|5.0|When it comes to singing/performing musical theater songs of Sondheim, Webber, Lerner/Loewe, Streisand is one of the top three voices in the music world who can deliver the songs with perfected artistry, vibrancy and great, exceptional delivery. There is no question about that. Do you know why ? Well, get this classical art songs done by the diva and learn the secrets of great singing and proper technique. Streisand didn't take the operatic/classical music world by storm when she released this body of work but she provided enough reasons to the critics why she can sing pop songs or musical songs with so much ease and beauty. Don't expect a Leontyne Price or a Victoria de los Angeles from this CD. But Classical Barbra shows off Streisand's mastery of legato, phrasing and a sharp ear for hard-to-follow melody. This CD remains to me as one of the finest works done by a pop singer in the field, unlike Michael Bolton's lack of technique in his supposedly aria music. She chose songs that are wonderful in melody but still challenging to follow. And she comes out high above the rest of them with this CD. Bellissima, Barbra ! The Funny Girl was a promising recitalist, maybe she is still so.
0440213525|4.0|Even though &quot;The Client&quot; doesn't really have a heavy conflict, the climax is awesome!....My fave character would be the courageous Reggie Love, the attorney who defended the 11 yr.old Mark Sway...It's an easy to read book....You will be hooked from the first chapter until the last!
B00005RY7X|5.0|andrew wk deserves 5 stars because he has accomplished the unbelievable feat of combining the speed metal aesthetic with infectious synthesizer pop.  what a weird concept, but it works. this is one of those rare albums that almost always lightens the mood, without reducing itself to a joke.        the songs are written in a way to trick the average listener into thinking they are listening to simple anthems about partying. and while that is partly true, a closer listen reveals some absolute pop gems that draw from a diverse and unique mix of influences.  the title track is a perfect example, with these bright and uplifting keyboards layed out over heavy guitars and a fast four-four drumbeat; coupled with andrew wk's repetitive growling and angelic female backing vocals, it comes off sounding like a metal version of the pixies mixed with abba.  yes it is that weird, but that makes it all the more enjoyable.  all the songs kind of come together under similar concepts.  \\"ready to die\\" sounds like what would happen if the misfits, motorhead, meatloaf, and a-ha entered a suicide pact together.  \\"party hard\\" boasts the most memorable guitar riff since \\"smells like teen spirit\\".  every song has these constant repetitive background vocals that will make you swear you are being programmed for a cult.     all the songs are simple in structure.  however they are unbelievably catchy and put together in a way that breaks practically every rule about how rock and roll music is made nowadays.  the music is played with a raw energy despite the wall of sound type of production.  the lyrics are basically telling you to lighten up and bang your head, sounds good to me.
0440211727|4.0|\\"A Time To Kill\\", which was the first novel done by John Grisham, contained courtoom drama, hatred and sometimes, a bit of humor. I think this is one of Mr. Grisham's finest books with such awesome climax. I couldn't put this book down and missed the things that I should have done earlier. The first chapters were alarming and Carl Lee, the black father whose dauther was raped and sought revenge by killing the rapists was a real hero. Jake, his lawyer was choosing between his role as a father and a husband and role as a lawyer. This is a really interesting story.
0876852630|5.0|Charles Bukowski is wicked awesome. It's another book about Henry doing exactly what Henry does. I think it's a love it or hate it kinda thing. Chances are, if you hate it, you're a bafoon. Did I spell bafoon correctly?
B000002WPI|5.0|this is the best album ever.if you dont have it get it
B000002H97|5.0|I really like this album. To me, it has the elements that make Metallica great: killer riffs, powerful Hetfield vocals, and intelligent lyrics. My one small problem with \\"the black album\\" is that quite often many of the songs on it get played to death on the radio(Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters) so it is not hard to get sick of them. All in all, though, it is something worth checking out if you have an open mind to different styles of rock and metal.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Ok, at first this movie may seem really depressing and it definitely packs a punch the first time you see it, looking back at it, it's just hilarious.  The problem isn't the heroin, it's that the characters are stupid.
B0000640RX|5.0|The problem with the other reviews here is that they are mostly about Rambo II. The truth is that the first film is the most socially relevant, about what happens to people who go through high trama, due to war. The second is really good no doubt, but they are really different films. The third film however, lacks the realism of the first, or the all out mayhem of the second and settles for just being a sequel, but the trilogy wouldn't be complete without it.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This movie is a classic! My parents like it, too. The DVD is fantastic with the featurettes, the first outlook, trailers, commentary, and others that are on the DVD. Tom Hanks was Oscar Nominated for Best Actor. Rent &quot;Cast Away&quot; on video or DVD or see it when it's on TV, if you have not seen it. And if you liked it, buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B00005YXZH|4.0|While YHF is a gorgeous and imaginative pop album and quite possibly the best album released this year so far I would urge all Wilco zealots out there to pull back the reins a bit. I would hesitate to call YHF the &quot;best album of the decade&quot; or for that matter the best of Wilco's career. This piece shows Wilco's penchant for evolving both musically and sonically as well as the adventurism to experiment all while keeping the song first. The radio squall that some say overshadows this album actually creates an overall landscape in which Tweedy roams freely. While the weakest songs on the CD are the more hook oriented tracks there's really not a bad moment on YHF. So to all the nay Sayers out there I say get over it. Wilco will never go back to the A.M. days. As far as YHF being an instant classic I say give it time. It may or may not cement itself in rock history. How Wilco does in the post Bennett/Coomer era remains to be seen. Personally I feel Wilco's best is yet to come.
0385503954|5.0|Atonement is a tour-de-force, McEwan's measured prose is a delight and chapter effortlessly follows chapter before the lack of an obvious plot becomes apparent. By then this reader was totally absorbed in the other worldliness of middle class England between the World Wars. Suspense then builds steadily towards a dramatic conclusion that very few will second guess.
0780631684|5.0|Death. It's a touchy subject for everyone. But director James Wong doesn't take it lightly in his hot horror-thriller, Final Destination. In Final Destination, Devon Sawa plays Alex Browning who -- after having a vision -- saves himself and 6 others from an exploding plane. Turns out, \\"Death\\" wasn't through with them. One by one, they begin to die gruesome deaths. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's plan, and save those who are barely hanging on.<br /> Final Destination was a very big sigh of relief for the horror genre after the slur of masked maniacs that had recently hit the big screen. Jeffrey Riddick's (storywriter) interesting idea was turned into a very interesting and deep movie by screenplay writer Glen Morgan and director James Wong. A very good element in Final Destination is that its characters were well developed and you cared for them by time Death made his way into their path. And the actors and actresses that made these characters all did great jobs in making us believe them. Devon Sawa - one who I personally never liked -- perfects the scared and confused but brave Alex Browning. Ali Larter - who has always been a favorite -- plays the part of Chloe, and plays it well. The remaining cast - Kerr Smith, Sean William Scott, Kirsten Cloke, Chad Donella, and more -- all did well. There's also a worthy cameo from Tony Todd, the infamous CandyMan. Great casting for this movie! <br /> The New Line Platinum Series DVD is something to be proud about. There are two commentaries: one from James Wong, and another from Glen Morgan and the cast. With the deleted scene and alternate ending, it shows a different way the story could have went, but glad they didn't. Even though it is very interesting. Two featurettes are also present. One that explains the process of the test screenings that Final Destination went through, and another about a woman who claims to have premonitions much like the ones Sawa's character experiences in the movie. Rounding out the extras are two entertaining games, the theatrical trailer, and bios. <br /> Final Destination is one to keep at the top of your list, and so is the DVD release. Here's hoping that the already hyped sequel is just as good, if not better.
1558908358|5.0|A sumptuous throwback to the days of Atari.  Boys like me still dream of inhabiting computers - and building new worlds inside of them.  Brilliant!<br />But I wonder what I'm missing that's included in the new edition.  *pout!*
B000003BEV|3.0|This has probably been the most mercilessly panned Stones album of all time, with critics and fans alike taking potshots at it, and with most dismissing it as a \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" ripoff and a flop, both artistically and commercially.  When it was first released, I didn't care too much for it, either.  However, having given it another chance (after many years), I have modified my opinion.  Of course, the whole project was an experiment (some have suggested that it was more of a practical joke) and, while it was not the best idea the Stones have ever had, it has its moments.  It mainly succeeds as a showcase for the considerable musical talents of the late Brian Jones, giving him a musical laboratory in which he could experiment freely.  In that sense, it is a fairly good album; one can hear Brian's influence throughout, and it serves as a testament to his amazing versatility , talent, and flair for musical innovation.  While it is certainly not the best album the Stones have ever done, it is surely one of the most interesting.
0060273224|5.0|Some people say that you can't judge a book by it's cover, but in this book it is particularly true.  The cover makes Sabriel look not as pretty as she is, and the monster look lame.  However everybody shuld read this book.  It is my favorite.  IT is mildly scary, filled w/ mystery, and even has a hint of romance....
0385501560|3.0|Firstly, I am a fan of Chuck Palahniuk.  I've found all his books to be original, refreshing .. if somewhat disturbing.  So I had great expectations when I started on his latest book, 'Choke'.  Was I disappointed?<br />Well, let's see.  I expected an original, thought-provoking story.  Unfortunately the story, while original (..about a sexaholic, his strange mother, and his trashed out friends), is not particularly thought-provoking.  The characters didn't have the depth or weirdness of those in his other novels.  There is an unexpected, and rather good, surprise towards the end of 'Choke' but it wasn't enough to derive any entusiasm.<br />I also expected Palahniuk's brilliant prose, complete with often funny one-liners.  Here is an example from 'Choke':<br />\\"The magic of sez is it's acquisition without the burden of possessions.  No matter how many women you take home, there's never a storage problem.\\"<br />Great stuff.  Sadly, there were only a handful of such gems in this book (whereas nearly every other page in Palahniuk's other books contained such jewels).<br />Bottom line: a relatively weak, derivative effort by Palahniuk.  Fans will be disappointed.  Palahniuk newbies should look to any of his other works to appreciate his brilliance.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is a movie that can arguably be called the greatest movie ever made (and I lean towards the belief that it is one of the greatest movies ever made). The innovations Welles and Toland made in the cinematography and as a director were years and years ahead of their time. The makeup and art direction is Oscar Worthy. Even Robert Wise's editing was well done. Welles use lighting, the deep focus, long takes, and low angles was revolutionary. Sure, there are several plot holes and continuity goes all to hell, but you don't notice it. That's how much the movie captures you visually, and with the superb acting from Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everette Sloan, and Dorothy Comingore you don't notice until you've seen it several times. Oh, and before I forget, Hermann was the composer.<br />The DVD itself has a lot of great features, this is how a DVD should be made. It is a 2 disc set that is packaged beautifully in a slipcover case. There is commentary from Roger Ebert (who really analysis the film for you) and Peter Bogdanovitch, who was apparently a friend of Welles and has alot of great insights. You also get quick interviews with Ruth Warwick (the actress to portraits Kane's first wife) and Robert Wise (editor).<BR>One major problem with the DVD is that in the storyboards, production stills, and call sheets you have no control over how fast they go. pretty much at the mercy of the DVD. <br />Disc 2 contains a 2 hour documentary on the Battle for Citizen Kane between Welles and Hearst.<br />It Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made? I don't know, but certainly in the top five.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is one of the best CD i'ev ever heard! CCYOOMH is an absolute success and songs like 'In Your Eyes' and 'More more more' are simply irresistable. This should one of Kylie's best work.It's definitely worth a buy.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Yes, many of you HATED this movie, but I really viewed as an odd experiment.  The least commercial director dies and hands off a project to the MOST commercial director (other than Michael Bay)?  Hmm.  Intriguing.  I've noticed that Spielberg often alternates between his money films (Lost World, etc.) and his personal films (Schindler's List, etc.)  This one is definitely in the more personal category, as there is almost no mainstream appeal here.  This movie should be recommended to anyone who enjoys mid-20th century science fiction novels, like Asimov and such.  I love those books, and since this story sprang from that era, it's no wonder I liked this film so much.  Also, the extras on this DVD are decent, even if they are a bit light in content (why was this 2 discs?  Oh yeah, so I could pay more!)  Rent it, at least.
0802130208|5.0|I don't know why it took me thirty years to pick up this book and read it...but wow! I'm glad I did. Ignatius J. Reilly is arrogant, smelly and wickedly hilarious! His distaste in everything and everyone cracks me up. So many times during the read I was baffled yet thoroughly entertained by this character and all of his misadventures. I laughed out loud many times reading this book. It's too bad the author never lived to see it win a Pulitzer...but for some reason, I think that he may have scoffed at the idea anyway.
0881030376|5.0|The novel Of Mice and Men by john Steinbeck is a unique book. The book is about two friends, their dreams and solidarity of others.George and Lennie are two main characters and two amiable friends. Also they look after each other, but George can't guard Lennie because Lennie has a mind of young child, so he get into trible very oftan. As migrant workers they run to accomplished thir dreams. The friendship of Lennie and George and solidarity of others is the main theme in this book. I like the book because it has such a good lesson to learn, and the language that has an effect that touched the heart. I will absolutely recomend the book because as I menntioned about that Lennie gets into trible very oftan, so to protect him George has to make big decision for Lennie. So to find outhow he protects his friend, to learn about friendship, and how solidarity effects others lives, you must read the book Of Mice and Men.
0066620996|5.0|When America ceases to be good, it will cease to be great.  Likewise for people and companies that make up America.  For a full explanation of what this means, I suggest that you read Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point: Character, Leadership,...&quot;, in addition to James C. Collins' useful book on leadership and management.  Never cease to be good.
B000002JSP|4.0|I gave this, along with LZ IV 4 stars because...well I gave IV 4 stars because it goes downhill after Stairway.  But, and this is a big but, IT'S STILL ZEPPELIN.  You can't go wrong.<BR>In Through the Out Door sounds nothing like Zeppelin, its sounds like the toned downed 80s, because John Paul Jones took over and the album went to hell.  I don't see the guy's talent, I'm sorry.  Jimmy Page is the saving grace to that band, the greatest guitarist of all time.  So when I get pianos and sythesisers, I don't know what to think.  There are only 7 tracks on the song...a bit unfortunate, especially since I would cut the following for the reasons included: \\"Hot Dog\\", just sounds [bad].  Sorry.; \\"Casambarasdersal;kjdf;lkja\\" or something, the 5th track.  Everyone gets an epic: Robert Plant got Stairway, Jimmy Page got In my Time of Dying, Bonzo got Achilles Last Stand, and JPJ got this...this annoying, sythesiser, minimal guitar song.  If they had come on the scene like this, Zeppelin wouldn't have gone anywhere.<BR>So, I'd get it if your a true LZ fan, because you need all the records, and it wasn't a terrible way to go, but Physical Graffiti was their last great album.  Ramble on.
0783110928|5.0|Gia was the first movie I saw Angelina Jolie in and I have to say she blew me away. Even though the film and book are different it seems to hold true to the basic fact that Gia was looking for someone she could depend on and someone to love. I thought Elizabeth Mitchell was fantastic. Not a lot has been said about Mitchell, but the scenes with her in them had me memorized. The book makes no mention about anyone in Gia's life that was like Linda. From what I understand Linda is a compilation of several different people in Gia's life. I found myself wishing, while I was reading the book, that Linda was real. Maybe Gia would have had someone to help her before it was too late. It was a great movie, bringing me to tears more times than one, but worth it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I think some skeptics out there need to take another long look at this movie. I see the same fact pointed out over and over again, this movie had no plot. Well if you really take a long look at it, it does. Not only does it have a plot, but it's a fairly complex plot as well. The flashy animations and everything were nothing more then a backdrop to good story. Things like the pod race, were essential. I don't think it's the fact that this movie had no plot. I myself, believe it's that the plot was a little too complex for all the A.D.D. kids out there that had their attention pulled away, by all the shiny aliens in the background. Don't punish a director or writer for your lack of attention skills.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I really enjoyed the film. Actually this is my favorate movie along with the Lord of the Rings.  So you may ask why did I only give it 4 stares.  Well only because they cut a little to much out like the dragon escape,the potions challange, and th eclasses.  But other than that it was perfect.  Even though it is nearly 3 hours long I never got board.  I don't even think it was long enough.  But the special effects were good like Voldemort and Fluffy.  So I relly recommend this movie and the book
0385335482|5.0|This is my favorite book. It's truely amazing, espicially if you love to shop! Becky Bloomwood is a 25-year-old single gal living in London with her perky flatmate, Suze. She works for a finance magazine, though she usually is totally bored with her job because she doesnt understand much of it. She's usually fantasizing about shopping or buying a desiner dress!(Totally like me) So the story is about how she's in debt, her meeting a guy, and her getting a fab new job! The author really lets you know exactly how Becky feels, and makes her an awesome character! Read it! I know you'll love it, babe! If you want to chat about the book, feel free to email me ...~!
0345350499|5.0|This truly is a great book. It is so supensful and draws you in so that you can feel for the characters. I am in 7th and love this book. Marion Bradley is a great author and i can't wait to read more of her books.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Now THIS is Jim Carrey at his best! Especially when he plays the role of...\\"The Grinch\\"! To me, this is Carrey's best work since the \\"Ace Ventura\\" films, \\"The Truman Show\\", and \\"The Mask\\"! The direction of Ron Howard (\\"Ransom\\", \\"Apollo 13\\") was outstanding! This has got to be Howard's best film of recent years! To me, \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" lives up to both the book and the cartoon versions in a VERY big way! This is among one of those films that will leave you with a feel-good feeling and that \\"The Grinch\\" will either have YOUR heart growing three sizes, or will have you laughing so hard until it hurts! The role of Cindy Lou Who went to an adorable young actress named Taylor Momsen. Taylor was made for this role and that I think she's the perfect choice to play one of the most important characters in this film. And the other most important character of the film was the Grinch's dog \\"Max\\", who is the only living person or thing that could tolerate the Grinch's nagging and yelling, etc. The citizens of \\"Who-ville\\", played by Christine Baranski (\\"Bowfinger\\"), Jeffrey Tambor (\\"Meet Joe Black\\"), Molly Shannon (\\"Serendipity\\"), Bill Irwin (\\"Stepping Out\\"), and Clint Howard (\\"Tango & Cash\\"), who is also Ron Howard's brother, gave excellent performances all the way! The special effects, such as the Grinch riding down from his cave on his high-powered sleigh, was simply amazing! I own the DVD of this, and I was surprised to find out the number of extras that are in the disc, like deleted scenes, the trailer, lots of behind-the-scenes featurettes, a special section for the kids entitled \\"Max's Playhouse\\", and much, much more! In closing, I just have to say that \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" will have you laughing, cheering, and a little bit of crying too. I really don't know whether to like the book, the cartoon, or this live-action version, because they are all classics to me! This will be a great addition to any DVD collection or any Dr. Seuss collection! You will agree that when you see that \\"The Grinch\\" is one of the best holiday films ever made, you will watch it over and over again...even after Christmas!
630471193X|5.0|This movie moved me to tears - can I rate it more than 5 stars?<BR>To this day I cannot hear Bryan Ferry's &quot;Dance With Life&quot; without being reminded that life is a gift and it's all about how you treat people and interact with them.  John Travolta has been my favorite since Welcome Back, Kotter and so versatile an actor.  When the town's mechanic changes to a genius overnight after seeing a brilliant light in the heavens on his 37th birthday, people don't know how to treat him.  As he touches lives with his gift, some are grateful, others suspicious.  If you have not seen this movie yet, DROP EVERYTHING and do so!  It will move you to dance with life!
B00004BZ16|4.0|Originally a sprawling, yet purposefull 3 record set, though not as good as the mega classic London Calling, another great achievement in it's own right. The Clash went deeper into reggae, but still would get back to their roots on tunes like &quot;Police On My Back&quot;. This is a very experimental album, and it's length makes it more difficult to digest.Even the parts I originally didn't like stuck in my head eventually, some becoming my favorite moments. I just re-bought this on CD (ORIGINALLY HAD IT ON 8 TRACK), after being without a copy for many years, and I still find it very satisfying 20 years after it's release.It's fitting that I just gave it another spin, I remember originally getting the tape right before my high school graduation around this time of year. I went to my re-union a couple weeks ago and this CD brought back memories of 1981. Bet I was the only guy in my  blue collar arena metal school that liked The Clash though.
B000062Y98|5.0|What can I say about this album? It's just perfect. Go and buy it right now!...
B000002UAO|4.0|What a lot of headscratching when this came out. What are those lovable moptops up to now? Well, little did we know at the time, this slightly odd album marked the first step of the Beatles' journey from pop stars into their expanded role, via their  expanded consciousness... With the benefit of hindsight, we  can see that from here, it's a straight line to Revolver, and Sargeant Pepper's. And where  they went, the kids followed and  brought the world along.<br />This album is the first  step on that journey we all took, from the world of the 50s  to the world  of today.
185984054X|5.0|Hitchens is one of the bravest and wittiest critics of culture and politics. Even when you don't agree with him, he is always a heck of a lot of fun. In this case, Hitchens has given ample evidence to why I feel so uneasy about Mother Teresa.<br />Where is all her money, and why wasn't she accountable for it?<br />Read this book. Its a brilliant, muckraking classic, essential reading for any free-thinker.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I too rate this as the best rock and roll album of all time. A perfect effort, something difficult to do with a double album. The Clash were just writing that many good songs then.I was mesmerized by this album when I first bought it on 8 track tape in 11th grade (1979). It stayed in my player constantly. The Clash mixed reggae styles with their more traditional punk, rockabilly. r n' r stuff better than any other British group. The album is a big production that still manages to have street grittiness and soul underneath. The Clash matured quickly from their simple punk beginnings, maybe too quick; they weren't around long enough.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have seen in the past five years. And believe me, I've seen hundreds in that time. <BR>    John Cameron Mitchell is the classic tragic hero, lured into a drastic operation to flee his homeland and be with his sugar daddy. When it all falls apart, poor Hedwig is left to latch onto who he/she can become one with. Again, everything falls apart, and by the end of the story, our valiant warrior princess must either love herself or perish. A dark sense of humor keeps this movie from being just another cheap gimmick flick.<BR>    One of the things that makes this picture work, besides the acting, is the music. The songs are as twisted and funny as the rest of the movie, and help convey the underlying depression even better. I dance and sing to this movie in the same way my mother used to dance to \\"Grease,\\" and I'm a \\"Hellraiser\\" fan! Plus, it sounds even more fantasic if you have a DTS sound system.<BR>   I recommend this to anyone who likes something with more to say than the average movie, and doesn't mind what seems odd at first.
B000050FEN|5.0|I saw SE7EN 3 times until now on VHS &amp; in TV but still very NEW to me; this movie is one of the best in the decade with out any doubt.<br />David Finsher made a magnificent job in it like all his movies (including Alien 3 that I like), and believe me this picture is the best in the nineteen's.
B00003CXE7|1.0|This film is simply overrated junk.  The fact that it was so decorated at the Academy Awards made me lose my last remaining shred of faith in the Academy.
B000006Z1X|3.0|Alcatrazz  Disturbing the Peace 1985 If you're looking for the Rainbow influence on this album you will be disappointed. Disturbing the Peace sure doesn't sound like Rainbow, but there are some good songs. My personal favorites are \\"Will You Be Home Tonight\\", and \\"Mercy\\". I think when Steve Vai did this album he was in his twenties. Steve Vai is a phenomenal guitarist and you can hear that by listening to this album. \\"Desert Diamond\\" is Steve Vai's best moment. I also think that Graham Bonnet's voice was best when he was in Rainbow. Despite the fact that the Down to Earth album was much maligned it did have some good songs. I think the song \\"Stripper\\" on Disturbing the Peace sounds like Judas Priest.<BR>I think you would probably like this Alcatrazz album if you like heavey metal. Disturbing the Peace does have some good songs, but I think that the album that Alcatrazz did with budding guitar hero and Swedish phenomenon Ywingwie J. Malmsteen is probably better than Disturbing the Peace. The song \\"The Power\\" about being on the road isn't very good. \\"Mercy\\" on Disturbing the Peace would probably work well live. I think it's a pity fans decided to be indifferent to the band; that's probably why, after doing this album, Steve Vai left to join David Lee Roth's band.  If you don't like heavy metal, or are not familiar with Alcatrazz, or if you don't like Graham Bonnet's voice then you should probably stay away from this album. I think if, you're interested in knowing what Steve Vai did with Alcatrazz and you're a fan of Steve Vai then this album is probably worth having in your collection. I also think that Jimmy Waldo is a good keyboard player especially on \\"The Power\\".  His keyboard playing reminds me of Jonathan Cains the keyboard player for Journey.
0451527712|4.0|Victor Frankenstein's creation had murdered members of his family and strangled to death his fiance on their wedding night fulfilling his threat to \\"be with you on your wedding night\\" and warned Victor, \\"You are my creator but I am your master.\\"  As Victor centered his life around creating the monster, he would later center it around hunting down and killing his creation.  This manhunt would expend Victor's life and prove his efforts futile to catch an untouchable and nameless monster.  This novel is full of enduring themes of ambition, friendship, and the conflict between the two, psychology, oppression and rebellion, the dangers of scientific and intellectual advancement, and societal injustice.  The writing itself isn't great but it's the story and the themes that make this a great classic.<br />Shelley wrote this book influenced by the period of time in which she lived, the Romantic Period.  This was the response to the previous time, the Age of Enlightenment.  In the Enlightened Age, reasoning was deemed of utmost importance and people thought that there were natural laws and that reason plus these natural laws would equal progress.  By progress, they meant not only advancement, but unlimited advancement, that society would continue to move closer and closer to perfection.  In Frankenstein, we see the result of so much logic and reason- the creation of a monster.  In the story there seems to be no natural laws governing the world.  The Romantic Period accounted for emotion like reasoning and logic cannot.  The monster as the center of the novel shows us as his direst need a companion, as does Frankenstein himself.<br />When I think of what natural laws would govern the world, Justice comes to mind as the most important.  Throughout this whole story, justice is so dearly lacking.  Injustice leads to more injustice.  The monster is born into unforgiving circumstances that were not his fault.  His creator rejects him immediately.  Throughout his life, the monster found himself rejected by everyone for the repulsive looks his creator gave him.  The monster even suffered rejection of the impoverished family he ardently and sacrificially helped.  When he saved a girl from drowning, her father shot him.  The monster yearned desperately for a mate of his kind, which Victor denied him for fear the two would breed an entire race of fiends or that she, too would reject him and there would be two fiends.  Decide this debate between the monster and Victor for yourself.  Even if Victor was right to deny him a mate, it was still an injustice for the monster.

The monster even suffered rejection of the impoverished family he ardently and sacrificially helped.  When he saved a girl from drowning, her father shot him.  The monster yearned desperately for a mate of his kind, which Victor denied him for fear the two would breed an entire race of fiends or that she, too would reject him and there would be two fiends.

B00004RFCM|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD set.  After I was done I wanted to watch the next series and I am currently and it is better than the 1st.  It is a good idea to watch them in order.  I really think this is much better than regular TV.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Great movie, great soundtrack.  Craig Armstrong's score is pure genius.  I highly recommend checking out his newest cd on Astralwerks.  Very sexy, very romantic, extraordinarily brilliant.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This ranks alongside &quot;Not of this Earth&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot; starring Ferrigno as one of the WORST wastes of celluloid on the planet.No character development,STUPID comic relief,and 99% CGI.Basically-it's a Star Wars screensaver for your tv.I've tried 15 times to watch this disaster-and with a gallon of coffee and 5 liters of Mountain Dew-can't stay awake.<BR> Keep in mind,I saw the original trilogy over 100 times and adore it-this...was a toy commercial.<BR> Quoting Randall from animated 'Clerks'-&quot;Get Lucas out of my sight!&quot;
0684803356|5.0|A friend commented, and I whole-heartedly agree, &quot;there is so much more to Hemingway than the caricature of Hemingway.&quot;  Amen.  This book is beautifully written.
B00005JKL8|1.0|This movie is the worst and I mean the WORST movie I have ever seen! I don't know what Hackman was thinking but I gotta tell you he wasn't when he agreed to make this flop. Here's a clue for you, if a movie comes out on DVD a month after it was in the theaters it's a BAD movie. I can't find 1 good thing about this movie, not the actors (By the way the lead Owen Wilson  will not get many scrips after this movie, I hope). Not the director (John Moore), After a successful career in TV commercials, were he should have stayed. This is his movie debut by the way and I hope it's his last. I just can't say enough bad things about this movie. If you waste the [item price] on this you will be saying the same things. This movie is so dumb it's laughable. My best laugh came when he (Wilson) has to use a satellite radio but has to climb on top of a mountain to get better reception. LOL and all these 50 or more guys chasing him that were 100 yards behind him are nowhere in sight after he gets up there. LOL. this is just plan bad. DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY. And just because I make really good movies dosen't mean I won't say when one is good that I didn't make.
0385721234|4.0|This is such a FUN book. It is a story about love, deception, family, tradition and... COOKING!<br />I fell in love with the characters, and was very happy to see leading ladies everywhere!<br />It was also very nice to be able to have a quick look at old fashioned recipes, and understand the process of creating them.<br />Finally, this book has enough drama, love and tragedy for a movie... and Im very happy it became one, which, by the way is also very good, and captures the real essence of the book.<br />************************************************************<BR>Este es un libro muy divertido.

B00005LC1H|5.0|For those who are familiar with Faulty Towers this CD set is a hoot.  Hour after entertaining hour of their special kind of dry English humor keeps you laughing forever.  For those not familiar with Faulty Towers if you liked any Monty Python then you will love these.  Too funny and where do they come up with all that silly stuff.  This set is always a crowd pleaser when entertaining friends or when needing to break the ice.  Have a party, put it on in the background and watch everyone loosen up and start laughing.

In the book A WALK TO REMEMBER,   Nicholas Sparks,  inspires the reader to focus on the love of a teenage couple.

Love is hard to find, but when you finally receive it, keep it, before it vanishes in a blank of an eye.<br /> Usually I wouldn't just pick up a book, open it, and read it.  But the cover of the couple holding hands caught my eye.  As I read this book, I realize that people go through  harsh things in life, when they don't even deserve it.  Because of Jamie's life style, of being an outcast, people looked down on her like she wasn't a person.

Jamie was in that tight spot.  One of the conflict in this story was between Landon and Jamie's father.  Landon was the neighborhood trouble maker.

B00005YU1O|4.0|Richard Linklater's animated philosophical discourse, \\"WAKING LIFE\\" is similar to his \\"Slackers\\" in its meanderings and musings.  However, this time around the visuals perfectly match the subject matter and in fact sometimes are the subject. This highly original and admittedly weird film is also a reaction and reflection of our drowning in the overwhelming \\"information age\\" wave that is sweeping down on western civilization.  All the characters in the Buddhistic implied puzzles of \\"Waking Life\\" one way or another circle around the central questions of How best to find meaning? And even more importantly, How to discern what is real?  It's the old, \\"Am I awake or dreaming I'm awake Zen\\" koan that's working full throttle here but in a slick digital mode.<br />In his non-linear quest for fundamental answers, our hero (Wiley Wiggins from \\"Dazed and Confused\\") encounters animated Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Steven Soderbergh, and Adam Goldberg among others.  The striking animation itself is a digital technique that paints over live action footage...  The style is extremely eye-catching and carries one over the more tedious passages of philosophical discourse and naval pondering.<br />About 15 minutes before the end, there's a great, theological riff by the animated Linklatter -- he's a minor character in the film -- about Philip K. Dick, the nature of time's illusion, God, and free will. Thought provoking and quite beautiful.<br />This unsual disc is loaded with extras including deleted scenes, an animation tutorial, a text commentary and a terrific audio commentary by the creative team responsible for this unexpected treasure. Don't miss this one.  And yes, it unfolds its meaning even more on repeated viewings.

B00004OCRN|5.0|This is an essential EP with acoustic version of Born To Run that brings a tear to my eye, an amazing cover of Dylan's Chimes of Freedom, a flat out sweet live version of Tougher than the Rest and a steal at under ... bucks.  What are you waiting for?
B0000636UN|4.0|Well it's been a while since Sheryl Crow went to the studio to record, but this record is well worth the wait. It might not be as strong as SHERYL CROW, her second album, in the lyrics department, but musically is has great catchy tunes that aren't designed to genuflect in the church of Pop Radio Music.<br />Bravo Sheryl for not selling out and turning out a barrel of garabe after becoming so famous. The rumor is that several of the &quot;hottest&quot; R&amp;B producers were originally working on this album, and they were subsequently dismissed so Sheryl could create her signature music after a much troubled personal period since the Central Park Concert.<br />The guest vocals are a decidedly interesting mix that highlite each of the songs where someone appears. The Paltrow vocals are unexpected, but not unappreciated. All in all the guest vocals round out the music in a pleasant way that gives more texture to the work.<br />From a less critical standpoint, if you want a CD to rock to this summer, this is the album.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Anyone who wants to balk at the huge success of Diana Krall needs to get a clue real quick.  Ms. Krall may be young and blonde and beautiful, but she's also a talented musician.  <br />Jazz police holler all you want, Diana may be marketed as a sex symbol, but so is 90% of the artist out there.  I mean does anyone really think Britany is THAT talented?  If Britany were ugly, would she be as popular as she is?  <br />I don't fault Diana for being beautiful.  I don't fault her marketing staff for capitolizing on it.  If she wanted to sell out she'd knock Celine Dion on her behind and do mediocre pop music.  Instead, she's out there turning the masses on to Jazz.  This record is absolutely beautiful with amazing production, packaging, and song selection.  Diana is well poised to be the next BIG THING.
B000005HNQ|5.0|My Husband love's gothic bands and he introduced me to bands like Lacuna Coil,Theater of Tragedy,ect. One day he played The Gathering for me. And I noticed that the lead singer sounds like the lead singer of HEART. So I came on to this web-site looking for more cds by The Gathering and realized that the lead singer of The Gathering has the same name as the singer from Heart. I freaked out. I'm so happy that Anne Wilson has turned goth I grew up listening to her wonderful voice. I've always been a huge fan of HEART now I'm a huge fan of The Gathering. If Anyone want's to hear Annes early stuff get Little Queen or Hearts greatest hits. Anne sings along with her sister nancy who plays lead guitar. Way to go Anne!!I love you. Anne has inspired me so much to sing.And to start my own band.
B00005JKDR|5.0|That was my reaction when I saw the first infomercial about this movie. What is this? A animated horror movie from Disney? NO. This was the most funny movie from Disney I saw in a long time. I saw this a couple of times and still think the same. It was a master piece of art. Pixar & Disney had make a good job!!
1573225517|4.0|While reading High Fidelity I was reminded of the struggle of human beings and finding their one true love. In the story of Rob and his life as a record store owner Hornby constantly throws a comical satire that makes this story funny with a constant remedy of humor around everyone's own eccentric view points. The book may have seemed somewhat light hearted and comical to those who have not experienced love, however it holds a much deeper meaning to those that have been afflicted by love and all its battles.<BR> This book is somewhat disheartening at times with such negative outlooks on life and love, however the reader then realizes that it is not love and life that brings you down it is how you look at it. And in this case Rob views them in a negative way which can cause issues with the reader. This book is very good and somewhat enlightening, but one must remember that although Rob is messed up psychologically and is searching for something inside himself, that it is just a book.
006016848X|5.0|At its core this book is nothing more than a guide to help men and women communicate more effectively with each other.  We often say things that come across as hurtful to those we care about whether we mean it that way or not.  Gray tries, and mostly succeeds, to give us a way to break the harmful patterns we're so used to and start relating to each other in a more respectful way.  <br />I can virtually guarantee that if you read &quot;Men are From Mars...&quot; you are likely to see many many arguments and/or problems that you've had in current and past relationships laid out almost verbatim.  Fortunately, along with those examples he also offers advice on how to prevent them from ever happening or resolve them if they do.<br />I'm not going to pretend that every word in here is solid gold and some of his examples of positive dialog actually did make me laugh because they were so over the top.  The bottom line here, though, is that there is some very helpful information here that we can all learn from.  I can honestly say that I've used techniques he suggests and that the results were very positive.  What higher recommendation for a relationship book could you want?

B000002UB6|5.0|I can't understand why people don't like this album as much as abby road or other beatle albums. The album contains all time greats &quot;Let it be&quot;, &quot;the long and winnding road&quot;, &quot;get back&quot; and &quot;across the universe&quot;. It also includes &quot;Two of us&quot;, one of my favorite paul mccartny songs as well as &quot;I me mine&quot; a very underated george harrison song and apart from the crazy I ME ME MINE corus is realy good. Other songs that impressed me were &quot;for you blue&quot; and &quot;I got a feeling&quot;. The rest of the album I admit is a little rusty. &quot;Dig a pony&quot; is good but a little to long and &quot;One after 909&quot;( first written in 1962) never was good enough to realse. The other to songs are &quot;dig it&quot; and &quot;dirty maggie may&quot; two funny short songs. <br />All in all this alubum is good to listen to and contains alot of underated Beatle songs.
0971855110|5.0|Are you living in CHAOS?  Do you feel depressed and overwhelmed, especially by your house?  Is your dear husband threatening to check into a motel, just so he can find the phone when it rings?  Are you always running late and yelling at your babies because you can't find your car keys... again?  Believe me, I understand, and so does  FLYLady!  She is one of us, but she has found the way out, and she is shining her light, one baby step at a time, for us to follow her out of the miry pit of clutter and more clutter!  This book will change your life.  If you are depressed because your home and your life are a mess, spend a few minutes with our dear FLYLady, and you will find the beginnings of the changes that have eluded you until now.  FLYLady shows us how to baby step our way out of our clutter and chaos to a life of peace and productivity.  You can do anything for 15 minutes at a time!  Even change your life.<br />Most of us who were born domestically and organizationally challenged are attracted to every new organizing book that comes out.  I personally had dozens of them, including the system FLYLady herself once used, the Pam Young-Peggy Jones card file system.  (She credits Pam and Peggy with developing this methodology, but I think she is too modest.  I love Pam and Peggy, too, but their books did not change my life.  This one did.  I still re-read the P&P books from time to time because they are very funny, but I was never able to make that complicated card file work (although it was great fun putting it together).  But what FLYLady has done is to take the germ of the idea Pam and Peggy had and make it so simple that ANYONE can do it.  It's OK to start small.  It's OK not to do everything perfectly.  In fact, perfectionism is the only thing that is NOT OK: \\"Housework done incorrectly still blesses your family\\".  You learn to establish small routines, morning and evening, and to spend 15 minutes a day de-cluttering your hot spots.  <br />And somehow, little bylittle, and before you know it, a transformation has occurred.  No more pretending you aren't home when the doorbell rings! Your husband and friends will be complimenting YOU on how great your house looks.  Buy this book!  Buy 10 copies and give them to your messie friends.  Put them in your daughters' hope chests.  Donate one to your library.  Did I mention it will change your life?
B00005U122|5.0|I truly don't know what to say about this DVD.  The only word that comes to mind is - AWESOME, and the only thing better than buying this DVD would have been to be at this concert.<br />If you love PF - buy this DVD.  You will not regret it.
B00004TLMC|2.0|My wife and I did not enjoy this unsmurfalicious film. It was so not up to par with the rest of Kubrick's films. I'd rather sit and watch Gargamail sing happy songs to butterflies than have to sit through this junk again. This was one smurfed up film.
0783229526|5.0|When I say this films CRAzY CRAzY CRAZY, I mean it in good way. More films should be made this way, and it's further proof that ex-Monty Python cohort Terry Gilliam is one of my favorite directors in addition to David Lynch, DAvid Cronenburg, and Atom Egoyan. From beginiing to end, it's a non-stop drug-induced completely insane and mind boggling array of dream imagery...and even dreams aren't even this wild, it's as if the characters in your dream got hit by a swift surge of brain vein or something and are spiralling utterly out of control...<br />As Johnny Depp's character says at the end speaking of Benincio Del Toro's character: \\"...He was too weird to live.\\" I'll let you interpret that one for yourself. Anyway, this is one bad trip of a circus ride where it's hard to pick out any scenes: some include: taking massive doses of ether to the point where walking and all depth perception is dismantled, then going to a circus (which Depp describes as \\"What the THird Reich would have done every Saturday night if they had won the war.\\"); an insane nearly 10 minute situation where Del Toro is in a bathtub and Depp tries to throw a radio in it and...it was too confusing to explain...Infact, the whole movie is completely mad which is why it rocks so much. Like a good Burroguhs novel or something, too ineffable to pick out anything just go along for the ride and enjoy yourself.<br />That's all I can really say about this strange, classic, beautiful film...and, oh yeah, WATCH OUT FOR THE BATS!
B00003CXUM|5.0|I recommend the Criterion Edition of In The Mood For Love with no reservations.  I'd like to respond to a previous reviewer who criticizes the former work of Wong Kar-wai by suggesting the director imposes &quot;westernized&quot; forms on Chinese productions. Consider first that John Woo, of Hong Kong, ushered in an orchestral action vision through the Better Tomorrow films, The Killer, and Hard Boiled, which continue to influence &quot;western&quot; culture. And remember that films don't begin and end in &quot;western&quot; forms.  Wong Kar-wai, like many intelligent film-makers, makes use of multiple influences, including Woo, Godard, probably Pekinpah and others.  It's presumptuous and, I think, reductive, to imply an artist engages too much with something like &quot;westernized&quot; forms -- I'm not sure this has any meaning to begin with.  Luckily, most challenging and worthwhile film-makers are inspired by, know of, and pay homage to a variety of films and directors, &quot;western&quot; and otherwise. Wong Kar-wai is certainly no exception.  He's a young film-maker with impressive potential -- and a fine resume already. <BR>     If you're only now coming around to Wong Kar-wai, I recommend not just In The Mood For Love, but Fallen Angels, Chungking Express, and Ashes of Time, among others.  And, of course, by all means try to get the Criterion Editions, if and when they're available.  Thanks.
B00005JKCF|4.0|Well. What do we have? Just another movie based on the books of comics? Just another variation of Superman and X-men? In some way - the answer is YES. Cause such books have a lot in common. But<br />But it is completely different. The main hero is not Superman or Batman. He is Spider-Man.<br />This movie is made in a very cool way. It is really fun. There is some romance here. It is not stupid as some other movies of such a kind. Director is really talented man with a great sense of humor. Actors and their characters are wonderful.<br />And besides everything - this is a story with a long long history. This is a story about the great battle of light and darkness. Who will win in this battle? The answer which gave us Spider-Man is LIGHT. So if U dont like this film just think about this thought. And PLEASE dont abuse this cool movie anyway.
B000002V0Q|5.0|A really neat CD. Heavy riffing and very tight bass and drums. The best song is probably AofA or Sweating Bullets. There's nothing to complain about. It may be commercial but it's still heavy. More power to Megadeth!! And oh, please come back Dave!!!

B00005YXZH|4.0|I bought this CD as a past Wilco, Tweedy fan and having read numerous reviews in various publications. Since it came out the same week as new Elvis and Westerberg, I had not had the chance to spend much time with it. Today on our local, wonderful public radio station WDET, they played the CD in its entirety. Net net: this CD takes you places that many artists never ever dream of. A little quirky, but today, quirky melody is all right.
6304167660|5.0|I can't say that i have seen another Ted Demme film, but when i was watching the Bafta's and they played the old 'film people who've died this year' bit, and Ted Demme's name came up, i almost choked.<br />I'm sad that he'll no longer be making films... but i'm glad, and eternally greatful that he was on this earth long enough to make this film.  I discovered it by chance and would hope that everyone could share this blessing as it is always the best circumstance in which to see a film.  No preconceptions.<br />I'm presuming that you've seen this film and that is why you're reading this. If you haven't, forget everything you've read.  Forget about the film.... then in a year or two, go rent it out, whilst pulling a sicky, and watch it.<br />Then watch it again.<br />Rest in Peace Ted Demme. Thanks for making me laugh.

B0000028M7|5.0|Words cannot describe how amazing this CD is. I can't tell you how greatly it has influenced my life. Forget the weak imitations: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Godsmack, etc. This is the real deal. AIC is to blame for the surge of grunge and grunge-like garbage that plagued the 90's, but how were they supposed to know? Any track off Dirt blows away anything you'll ever hear on the radio, but AIC is too good for radio play, even after Layne Staley's tragic death. There aren't words to describe AIC's truly unique sound. They're not grunge. Grunge means all the songs sound exactly the same and the vocals are monotonal. It's more of a cross between metal, hard rock and grunge. I can't suggest a few select tracks, as they're all so good that I can't live without any of them (Even the unnamed track is worth listening to). If you like any grunge or \\"alternative\\" 90's bands, listen to this or the beautiful Jar of Flies and be prepared to be blown away...
0141180870|3.0|The extremley long second novel of Fitzgerald explores many of the same questions that Fitzgerald probed in his first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise.&quot;  This book is very long and could have been abridged and reached the same point.  His least exceptional book by far, but a lyrical masterpiece none-the-less.  The loss of potential by the novel's protagonist, Anthony Patch is less emotional than the bildingsroman of Amory Blaine or the character deterioation in &quot;Tender is the Night.&quot;
B00000255F|5.0|There has been a lot of great tunes out there in rock. However, there are few great albums... the collections of cohesively solid songs which are terrific alone, and better together.<br />&quot;Born to Run&quot; is one of those great albums.<br />It would've been enough to enjoy the futile hope driving &quot;Meeting Across the River,&quot; and the pure power of &quot;Born to Run.&quot; But instead, we also get the intense &quot;Jungleland.&quot; The piano and keyboarding in &quot;Backstreets&quot; has an almost &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; sound, but with much more passion.<br />Springsteen was in his prime, and made a prime album. I fully recommend &quot;Born to Run.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
0312954468|3.0|Wilbur Smith's River God is about fortunes, romance and war of the ancient Egyptians during the decadent period pre- and post Hyksos invasion almost 2000 years B.C. The story is told by the eunuch slave Taita, who follows the events and life of his mistress, Queen Lostris, her lover General Tanus, and their son, Pharao Tamose (young Memnon). It has been my first book of this illustrious author, and I have to admit, I had a very difficult time to come up with suitable rating and review. The book reads very well and is a real page-turner.  It is adventurous, romantic, historical and philosophical in one sense, but short in terms of real historical references, lacking suspense and thrills, and misguided in terms of offered time horizons, and timing of events (sometimes days are described like years, and years like weeks). The main character, the narrator Taita, is bombastic and self-indulgent individual, who thinks, that he is 100% better than Archimedes, Homer, Copernicus, and Michael Angelo put together. I wish Mr. Smith didn't use that style in narrating the book. The novel, despite being far-fetched historical adventure, would be more interesting, if Taita was just normal, maybe a bit talented, server of the Egyptian nobles. In addition, I think, that despite apparent meticulous research done by Mr. Smith, his book's historic background is much less believable, than the one used by novelists like Pauline Gedge or Christian Jacq. On the other hand, the book was paced well and kept adventure unabated for all 650 pages, that I would be tempted to read the next chapters of Taita saga in `Seventh scroll' and `Warlock',
B00005OAIE|5.0|From the first time I heard \\"No Such Thing\\" on the radio a few weeks ago I fell in love with it.  That doesn't happen to me very often.  A song usually has to grow on me, but this guy has got it goin' on!  I went out last week and bought \\"Room for Squares\\" and danced around the house with my kids all night.<BR>I know he reminds a lot of you of Dave Matthews, my husband included, but I hear a lot of different artists inc: Seal,Ocean Blue, Squeeze. I'm just so happy there's a new young artist out there with this kind of music style. It has a good beat and you can dance to it, as Dick Clark would say. Keep up the good work John we need more uplifting music in the world these days!...
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I can easily assume that some old Prince fans are missing \\"kiss\\" or \\"purple rain\\" days, however what Prince has achieved in this album is not comparable with old stuff. Musicianship is at the peak and this is the most organic, warm sounding music I ever heard from Prince or from anyone. I can buy the whole album even just for 1 song called \\"everlasting\\". And the rest is just incredible. This album is about music... then RUSH OUT TO BUY THIS GEM ! RIGHT NOW !
0060977264|5.0|Paulo Coelho makes a mind-thinker about life, love, and choices people make. I enjoyed reading this book and didn't want it to end. This book was a very poetic story. It is about a women that has every thing planed out and thinks she knows what she wants. Then she has a childhood friend that flows with things and does things whenever. Finally they meet again and travel on an adventure to find love.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink's sophomore album \\"Missundaztood\\" is definitively not what you'd expect after hearing her debut \\"Can't Take Me Home\\". She changed form R&B to a mixture of catchy pop/rock songs. A reason for this development is the involvement of Linda Perry (lead singer of one-hit-wonder-band \\"4 Non Blondes\\"), who wrote or co-wrote eight out of 14 songs, and even appears on \\"Lonely Girl\\".<br />The album features a broad variety of styles from catchy party songs like the singles \\"Get The Party Started\\" (got overplayed) and \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" to self-reflecting and sad tracks like \\"Family Portrait\\" and \\"Gone To California\\". There are, however, a few outtakes like \\"Respect\\" or \\"My Vietnam (very corny lyrics). But songs like \\"Dear Diary\\" or \\"Just Like A Pill\\" make up for it. Another highlight on \\"Missundaztood\\" is \\"Misery\\", a duet with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, which features a guitar solo by former Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora.<br />This album offers you many ups and few downs. Pink's strong and unique is worth the purchase alone, as it sort of saves those songs which have weakpoints in the lyrical aspects. Pink has the potential to become a superstar and make music for years to come.
0316743003|5.0|This is a great little book about how the skunk works operated in the early years of supersonic R&D (specifically for cold war reconnaissance, though the authors do cover the starfighter and some other non-recon craft). Ben and Leo tell the tale of the creation of the SR-71 and (later) the F-117 beautifully. I would actually have to say that this tome helped me through my BSAE. It's inspirational and made me want to be a good engineer. Ben takes you through the trials and occasional tribulation that make it great to be a designer.
B000001ESP|5.0|The reason this album is the most recognizable is because of the two hit songs from this album that are played on rock stations quite often...'Tom Sawyer', and 'Limelight'. Of course these two songs are classics, but what about the other 5 songs? GREAT songs as well...but unfourtunatly not many people know much about them (unless you have the CD...and your a major Rush fan), because they don't get any airplay on the radio. Here's my review for all 7 songs on this classic album:<br />1.)\\"Tom Sawyer\\"(rating: 4/5)- This is the most popular Rush songs because i don't think there's not 1 single person who has NOT heard this song at least once. I gave it a 4 out of 5, due to it's CONSTANT airplay on the radio...it sometimes gets old...but its still a classic.<br />2.)\\"Red Barchetta\\"(rating: 5/5)- A GREAT song to listen to while you are crusing down the road...give's the song a stronger impact. This song is even COOLER on the live Rush album, \\"Exit...Stage Left\\"!<br />3.)\\"YYZ\\"(rating: 4/5)- Rush's second best instrumental...FIRST greatest Rush instrumental is \\"La Villa Strangiato\\", from the Hemispheres album. Geddy gives some awesome bass lines and synth FX in the song...Alex dose great guitar work (like always), and Neil's drumming is really interesting. Pretty cool instrumental!<br />4.)\\"Limelight\\"(rating: 5/5)- This is one of my favorite Rush tunes, eventhough it is played on the radio quite a bit. The reason i like this song better than \\"Tom Sawyer\\", is because this song just has more of an appeal to me, and it's not played as much as \\"Tom Sawyer\\". A VERY cool live version of this song can be found on another live Rush album called \\"Different Stages\\".<br />5.)\\"The Camera Eye\\"(rating: 5/5)- THIS is a song that deserves airplay!!! Only that the song is over 11min. long! This is in fact Rush's last song spanning over 10min! I think this song is right up there with \\"Natural Science\\", from the \\"Permanent Waves\\" album. Alex plays some GREAT guitar segments, and solos in thissong! This song is DEFINATLY worth a listen!<br />6.)\\"Witch Hunt\\"(rating: 3/5)- This is the only song that I find...ok. It's got some cool (and somewhat creepy) sounds at the beginning of the song. The live version of this song on the \\"A Show Of Hands\\" CD is better.<br />7.)\\"Vital Signs\\"(rating: 5/5)- This song sounds like a cross between regae, and The Police. The lyrics are somewhat obscure, but cool. A cool upbeat song.
B0000636UN|1.0|C'mon...C'mon... already.  This album is too long, too slow, has too many ballads and too many dang string arrangements.  I consider myself a Sheryl Crow fan and believe her previous albums are wonderful, even brilliant. But this thing has to be the smarmiest album I've bought/listened to in years.  It's both rythmically and lyrically uninteresting.  Too bad.  Don't waste your money.
0451527712|4.0|The monster is the most interesting, well-developed character in the whole book.  The monster doesn't even join the plot for several chapters but still, he is the center to all the themes of the book and the plot.  The novel is pretty much only about the monster, and to a lesser degree, Frankenstein.<br />The creature and Frankenstein each do terrible things, but I find the creature to be more forgivable and more worthy of compassion.  Frankenstein brought his problems upon himself, whereas the monster's problems were thrust upon him.  He tried so hard.  In the face of rejection and utter loneliness, the monster kept trying and trying to make friends.  For being the way his creator made him, his creator abandons him; for chopping much- needed firewood for an impoverished family he is screamed at and abandoned; for saving a girl from drowning he is shot.  Just when he feels he can't take any more humiliation and feels he will punish society, he gives it another try.  Eventually, he snaps.  He makes a transistion from an angelic creature to a monster.<br />The monster is \\"eight feet tall and proportionally large.\\"  He can survive in harshly cold climates and subsist on coarse food.  Even though Victor is well aware of the physical toughness and superiority of the monster, he decides to hunt this creature down.  In the epic showdown between the monster and Victor, the monster wins hands down.  In this sense, Victor's first name is ironic.  In the ending, the monster finally achieves what he sets out to do.  His original goal of peace was shattered but he managed to achieve the alternative goal of asserting himself with revenge and tormenting Victor to his death.  He didn't kill Victor; he let him kill himself hunting him.  It's not exactly a victory for the monster, but he maintained and decided to exercise what personal power he could.  He succeeded in not \\"taking it\\" and standing up for himself.  Throughout the novel, although he changes drastically in demeanor, he remains dynamic.  From his creation he set out to explore his world and learn to read.  Then he worked on the plan to become a part of the family in the woods.  After his goals of peace and love had definitely, hopelessly failed, he redirects his drive in a new direction.  He's always working on something; he always has a plan.  His determination and perseverence have been corrupted, not defeated.  It is this unstoppable drive that characterizes the monster as dynamic.he remains dynamic.

0694003611|5.0|I could probably recite this book in my sleep, and there's no reason our kids shouldn't grow up with the same warm fuzzy feelings when they think of this book and its soothing, reassuring bedtime rhymes.<br />And, if you're lucky enough to still have your parents, they can delight your kids by starting the story with, \\"your mommy/daddy used to LOVE this book, when he/she was your age...\\"  As they say in the ads... Priceless.
1853104825|5.0|This is the best book on human factors by far. Most books of this genera tend to put you asleep. Well written and researched. As each human factor is explored -several accidents are then reviewed and shown how the factors played a roll in the final outcome. For those who fly this is a must have -read it and live it.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Tom Hanks gives a tour de force performance in &quot;Castaway&quot; a generally excellent survival story. Combining humour, pathos and drama, Tom Hanks deeply humanistic portrayal of a helplessly marooned Fed-ex employee  and Robert Zemeckis' cogent direction keep you involved through most of the film. As a frequent flier I found the crash sequence quite harrowing-my greatest nightmare graphically brought to life. Hanks struggle for survival seems generally quite believable, except why didn't he open all the packages that washed ashore? The only criticism I have is with the long and drawn out downbeat coda between Hanks and Helen Hunt. Surely some tighter editing could have been used here, instead I found myself thinking &quot;get on with it already!&quot;. Still aside from this point I found &quot;Castaway&quot; to be both gripping and poignant and worth the investment of time.<BR>Recommended!
B000063CPL|4.0|I must say i'm quite impressed with the new live Maiden album. I held off buying it for awhile because i figured that i had enough live Maiden. But I finally got it, and i'm glad that I did, because it rocks. I like the production, it sounds very raw, but in a good way, and very live and in the moment. I saw the BNW tour, and obviously it's that setlist. I think they breathe new life into some of the old classics (&quot;Wrathchild&quot; sounds particularly inspired) and the Brave New World material sounds fantatic live. My only complaint is the inclusion of the 2 LONG Blaze era songs. I know that to have not played any of the Blaze material would be to acknowledge that those albums were not up to par, but i don't think they had to chew up almost 20 minutes with those 2 tracks. They could have played 1 or 2 of the shorter songs, and left a bit more time for a few more Maiden classics. With that said, &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; is bearable with Bruce singing! So, overall, if you are a Maiden fan, or an old fan who somehow missed &quot;Brave New World&quot; and wondering if the old guys still have any fire left in them, they do! Curious to hear what they do next!!
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I seem to remember Zoolander getting a lot of negative press when it came out.  I was also worried that Ben Stiller might be stretching and his comedy would start getting flat.<br />Well, after watching this, it proves you should always judge for yourself.  The movie has genuinely funny moments and was enjoyable.  Add Owen Wilson into the mix and you add a great writer/actor as well.  <br />So, give it a try and judge for yourself.
B00005YXZH|4.0|First, I'd like to say something to the reviewers on here who have charged that Wilco are attempting to sound like Radiohead: Are you ears made of tin?  YHF sounds nothing like Radiohead, which is neither a good nor bad thing.  YHF sounds like Wilco making beautifully conceived, marvelously realised music.  So they're not making stock alt-country any more.  So what?  So they're not afraid to experiment and try out new sounds, textures, production techniques, instrumentation, etc.  I can only applaud at the adventurousness of YHF, but I don't particularly feel the urge to slap the &quot;It's Wilco's 'Kid A'&quot; label on it.  Would that more bands had the guts to do what Radiohead has done with their last two albums, and what Wilco has now done on YHF.  This sort of irrepressible experimentation should not be so rare as to be viewed as an anomaly, rather it should be commonplace for a band with any sort of artistic merit to want to branch out from whatever formula they started with.  Listen, this is a great album, one of the best I've purchased in recent memory (Yes, buy it, don't just download it.  Wilco have bills to pay just like all of us.)  &quot;Radio cure&quot; is such a haunting, almost elegaic tune, as if we're tuning in on a bad A.M. radio transmission from a man adrift thousands of miles away on an ocean of static, desperately trying to reconnect to his world by writing a song (a radio cure).  &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot; sways with delightful wooziness, the instrumentation floating in and out as Tweedy rasps out an attempt to recapture a lover, his drunken bravado doing little to cover up his desperation and insecurity.  &quot;Poor places&quot; is a masterpiece of beautiful melody, quirky harmonic counterpoint, and finally a squall of radio static distortion that degenerates into  painfully wonderful white noise.  The album overall has a good flow to it, the more upbeat pop-ish numbers balanced by the moodier, more ambient pieces.  Neitheraspect takes over for too long, giving YHF a balanced feel that makes it easy to listen to all the way through.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Ali is basically an incomplete film.  If you want to consider it a time capsule of how Ali reached the pinnacle of his greatness, then you would be correct.<br />However, there was much left to be told in the story.  I think I would have wanted to see this film capture all of Ali's good and bad moments.  A lot of build-up but a little anti-climactic given how much of his story was omitted.
B00002SSRZ|5.0|Having read some of the other reviews of this DTS cd, I almost gave up on looking for a copy.  I'm sure you've read the comments regarding \\"missing bass\\" and \\"strange mix\\" attached to this version.<BR>It truly makes me wonder about the systems people are listening to...because this DTS cd's audio quality stands far above the typical dts music cd.  Clarity and imaging are absolutely stunning.  The bass is not \\"in your face disco-type bass\\" but certainly more than powerful enough.  My system is a THX-certified system, with 5 matching locally custom-built speakers, plus again a matching unpowered sub with separate amp.  The bass was clear and powerful.  Occasionally, the mix placed elements of the bass in other speakers than the sub--and this could be the problems that others were experiencing, if their surrounds for example are not the same quality as the rest of their system.  Either way, you can always turn up your sub if you must have stronger bass!!<BR>I owned this recording on Quad tape back in the 70's and this is definitly a different mix, not just a \\"let's save some money by putting the old quad master on dts\\" scam.  Again, I suspect the complaints are due to the fact that all of a sudden, certain elements of the music that were never audible on the stereo version can be clearly discerned--a great example is the rhythm guitar behind Carlos.  This is not a fault...it's a definite improvement.<BR>Other great features:  Organ lovers rejoice...the engineer puts the surround mix INSIDE of the Leslie cabinet in several places (\\"Black Magic Woman\\" for example) and the result is exactly the sound you hear up close to the Leslie cabinet. (I know...I've been playing through one for 30+ years)  And the percussion is perfectly placed around the listener...easy to tell the bongos from the congas, etc.<BR>All in all, don't be scared off by the other reviews.  I have several DVD-Audio discs that can't touch the sound of this cd.  And this is a classic that every classic rockfan must own!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Ok I liked &quot;Being There&quot; a lot. And like at least one other reviewer, I didn't buy &quot;Summer Teeth.&quot;  <br />The fact is that with this album Wilco have proved themselves to be one of the most important bands in a long time. Those people who wanted Radiohead to make another &quot;OK Computer&quot; didn't get it. Wilco have likewise refrained from trying to make another &quot;alt country masterpiece.&quot; I, for one, am grateful. <br />These songs are brilliant. Tweedy and company have forged a new sound. This is not a particularly accesible album, but then again how many truly worthwhile ones are? The instrumentation is varied, and one feels someone dazed by the poignancy and urgency of these songs. It took me a few good listens to get into &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,&quot; but now everytime I hear it I am reassured that experimental rock is alive and well.
B00005YXZH|5.0|A monumental album. Seamless, beautiful & cohesive. Raging with unbelievable commitment, focus & purpose. <BR>It has not left my system since it was released, and every time I play it I feel like I am hearing it for the first time. You have to listen to this album over and over and over again, more than any previous Wilco effort. <BR>But sooner, rather than later, there will come a listen when it will just explode into your concienceness. <BR>And seem as if it has always been there. <BR>And it will become as natural and \\"of course\\" and as great as St. Peppers or Blonde On Blonde or Astral Weeks or ... well that could go on and on...<BR>It is brilliant. It is a masterpiece. <BR>People who give this level of themselves to us deserve to be supported for it.<BR>If you care about music, you must buy this album.<BR>It's that simple. <BR>Tom Bjornsen tjbjornsen@earthlink.net
B00005O3VC|3.0|First off I just want to say that after all the hype of this movie, I was dissapointed. I think it is a good movie but it did not live up to my expectations or the hype. I do wish that I had rented it before I bought it, but oh well. There is one scene that I liked and that was the scene with The Black Night and he gets all his limbs cut off. I did have to force myself to laugh at this scene and some others, so it wasn't that good. My advice is if you haven't seen it, and you want to see it, see if you can rent it first. If you like it then, by all means buy it. I didn't even like the extras that much except for the English subtitles. I have to have them on when I watch a DVD because the sound is sorta low on my DVD player even if I have the TV sound halfway up to the maximum. I doubt if I watch this anymore for awhile. The most questionable point about this whole thing is at the end and the police officer puts his hand on the screen and it stops. I was very confused about that part and I had to select that scene and watch it again before I understood that that was how it was supposed to end. Boy I tell you what, the British putting the credits at the beginning really mess you up. All in all this is a good movie, but PLEASEEEE rent it before you waste [money] on it.
0380788624|5.0|Not a huge fan of his other work, frankly, but this was incredible. Codebreakers and accompanying derring-do were of no interest to me (or so I thought), so I don't know how I even ended up buying this, but I'm glad I did. <br />Despite the fact that this is a very thick book, with multiple storylines and zillions of characters, it seemed like a \\"quick read\\" because I was disinclined to put it down or start reading something else halfway through (a frequent habit of mine when a story flags). <br />Yeah, the female characters are kind of weak, but considering that military codebreakers and modern-day techno geeks are not overwhelmingly female, I didn't feel that the book was creating some artificial dearth in the face of real-life femme dominance of these industries. <br />Unfortunately, after epic chunks of interesting plots and asides and masterful weaving of past and present storylines, the ending is disorganized and rushed, which is typical of the Stephenson books I've read. Still, I liked this so well that I can't take away a star just because the author literally can't quit at the end of a story.

0789723107|5.0|I'm an amateur web designer/info architect and this book was a pleasure to read. It's not as meaty as other tech-y books out there but it's an excellent place to start.  That is, it doesn't have very detailed descriptions of usability practices or methodology.  However, it still gives excellent descriptions on things like usability testing (including a pretty good \\"script\\" for guidance and illustration).  So it's not really for the \\"converted\\" who already understand the importance of web usability and encorporating this mindset in design (although the book is still a good investment!).<br />And it's definately THE book to give to a non-technical manager/boss/supervisor who just can't understand the extreme importance of usability and what it means to the design process.  Steve Krug writes in a down to earth manner, the book is nicely illustrated with practical examples and you could probably finish it in one sitting but would read it again as a refresher course.
0613173503|5.0|The Long Walk is the only book I've read that actually left me physically tired after reading it. To describe this book as scary would be misleading (and an understatement). Horrifyingly intense is the only way to sum it up. There is nothing creepy or supernatural about this story. It is like nothing that has ever been written.<br />What makes this story so intense is the feeling that it could really happen in the near future. Stephen King is a genius when it comes to pulling you right into his nightmares. The story starts out very subtly and then you quickly learn what the contest \\"The Long Walk\\" is all about (and it aint no benefit marathon). What is truly amazing about this story is that it was written twenty years before the explosion of reality T.V. The story seems even more plausible when read today.<br />I have never been more engrossed in a story than this one. I really started to feel the fatigue and constant dread that these boys must have felt. <br />This book is for anyone who loves to enter a different world and be terrified. Whatever kind of sick person would like that is beyond me, but you know who you are. Read this book you will love it. Oh, by the way, keep in mind that a happy ending is never guaranteed in King's early novels.
B00003CY6M|3.0|At least it was better than his last effort, America's Sweethearts, which was truly awful.  He's certainly a reliable actor for any producer or director since he basically plays the same character in every one of his films.  If that doesn't bother you and you enjoyed his other films, you'll probably enjoy this one too. It's a decent date flick, but not one that you'd consider watching again such as When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle.
B000002H4C|4.0|What could someone add to an animated movie that contains action, violence, and mature content to really put it over the top? How about an awesome rock n roll soundtrack! Somehow rock and animation go together in this film better than has ever been done.<br />I remember seeing this movie at the tender age of 13 and watching the opening scene as an astronaut flew his convertible through the Earth's atmosphere while some tough rock song(Radar Rider)was blaring. I knew it was going to be different than any cartoon I had seen before. The soundtrack is really what gives this movie what no Japanese anime can deliver.<br />The music on this album is really odd ball. A couple examples: Black Sabbath without Ozzy Osbourne and Grand Funk Railroad past their prime. The songs are done by successful artists but the songs themselves aren't very big hits. The exception is \\"Open Arms\\" which was a chart toper. Hits or no hits these are top notch songs that represent the sound of early 80's rock.<br />The only thing I found disappointing about this album was that it didn't have any of the beautiful and sometimes eerie instrumental music from the movie. However, this album is for anyone who loves great hard rock from the early 80's or great soundtracks from any decade.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|I can't give it 5 stars, but I definately enjoyed this movie. That's what movies are for, entertainment. Not to be thoroughly analyzed and picked apart. Plus, this movie holds quite true to the true events even some of the smaller details that are often ignored. Once the action starts, it's loaded with excitement as well as great sound effects. The love story even adds a few small twists to the movie.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|\\"Shrek\\" is probably one of the worst pictures of 2001 - and yet, it was so highly anticipated and overhyped. I have a very good sense of humor, but I didn't find very many of the jokes all that funny. Some of them were annoying, and others were just gross or bad (like the dirty bathroom jokes). Sure, this was good animation - but it can't compare to Disney Pixar animation! The animation in Disney films like \\"Toy Story\\", \\"A Bug's Life\\", and \\"Moster's Inc.,\\" were truly superb. \\"Shrek\\" was just a wannabe. I do believe that the actors in the leading roles - Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and John Lithgow - are all very talented actors, and brought this film to life somewhat. I really cannot stand Mike Myers though - I hated him in \\"Austin Powers\\", which are also very unfunny and just plain bad movies, and didn't care to see \\"Wayne's World\\" or any of his other movies. The DVD is quite boring, too. They've even got \\"fake\\" interviews from the cast...why couldn't they just use real ones? I'm the only one I know who has seen \\"Shrek\\" and didn't like it. If you are looking for a great animated comedy from 2001 - then check out \\"Monster's Inc.,\\"! I recommend \\"Jimmy Nuetron: Boy Genius\\" over this one - at least \\"Jimmy Neutron\\" is kid-friendly. Too many adult jokes in \\"Shrek\\" to be named a child's movie. This was one giant bore and I hope there is no \\"Shrek 2\\". Leave this one on the shelf - it's not worth your time or money!
B00004SPYJ|5.0|From the first time I've seen this movie, it has stood out as the most amazingly beautiful portrayal of Shakespeare I have ever seen. I saw it in 9th grade and my entire english class was enthralled by it. If you like Shakespeare, you HAVE to see this movie!
B00005Y228|4.0|I never heard of Kylie until the Sydney 2000 closing ceremonies. Then, when &quot;Fever&quot; was released in the US, I decided to take a chance on it.<br />I'm glad I did! Great stuff to listen to. Every track a catchy tune that sounds great if you're dancing, driving, working out, or need cheering up.<br />You might call this &quot;fluff,&quot; but sometimes you need fluff to remind you that music can be fun, and not always heavy with an &quot;I hate life&quot; theme. Call this a guilty pleasure, then, because I've yet to get tired of this album.<br />By the way, I'm glad I bought this *before* Kylie's previous (import-only) album, &quot;Light Years.&quot; It compares to &quot;Fever&quot; like night to day. The tracks on &quot;Light Years&quot; are just... stupid. They're totally vapid and acoustically painful. If you buy &quot;Fever&quot; first, you won't enjoy &quot;Light Years.&quot; Trust me!
B000002KIE|5.0|Never Mind the Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols is a fantastic album. The Sex Pistols are punk rock, because most of their songs struck chords with the working class of England during the late 1970's. Songs like \\"God Save the Queen,\\" and \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" are the best rock and roll songs ever recorded period. There has never been a better singer than John Lydon (Johnny Rotten,) or a better punk image than Sid Vicious. Put this ablum up there with of the greatest of all-time, because it makes all those lists anyway. Lastly, this is for Harley Thomas Cardinal, you don't know nothing about punk rock, so stop trying to act like you do. How can you sit there and say The Sex Pistols are terrible; they are one of the pioneers of punk rock. I bet you listen to sell-out bands like Blink 182. Only  The Dead Kennedys, The Clash and Rancid, in my opinion could hold a candle to the what The Sex Pistols have accomplished
B00005JKCF|4.0|Good, ol' Spidey he's just fabulous. Yeah the movie is great, I think it is going to be a blockbuster. Toby Maguire, he fits in naturally into Spidey's character, he does not over act has a wry sense of humor with a controlled emotional element. He is the right choice, but Kirsten Dunst ( a good looker indeed) well I think she is there just to add a female sparkle. Her character requires more development, especially emotional impact, maybe in the upcoming spidey movies.<br />Technically I think the special effects are good but could have been much better. Some of Spidey's Swinging from building to building or crawl up the walls looked very cheesy and artificial, more cartoonish but let me emphasise it is only a few scenes.How Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) becomes spiderman was portrayed quite well, but I sure wish they had shown how Peter Parker actually made his Spidey costume<br />The Green Goblin character build up was not dynamic and powerful enough to hate the guy. I think I felt some sympathy for him rather than treat him as a villain. The evilness was not powerfully evident in the Goblin's character and the premise of becoming the goblin needed more soul and realism.<br />I went to watch Spiderman without any expectations and I can say that overall I am pleased with the whole package. I would give it a four out of five. I would not categorise it as \\"par-excellence\\" movie BUT a great fun movie with entertainment.<br />Well, I'll just end by saying inspite of minor glitches it is a GREAT MOVIE, GOOD EFFECTS, EXCELLENT FIGHT STUNTS AND A SATISFACTORY STORYLINE.<br />DO NOT MISS IT!!!
B000066796|5.0|Saw this film three times with three different people and loved it more with each viewing!  Although a touch of sci-fi in its time travel, it was delightful and even believable.  Meg Ryan has always been one of my favorites (\\"You've Got Mail\\" and \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\") but I guess I'd have to say I liked her BEST in this one...a hairstyle that looks as though she created it with a mixmaster...one that only SHE can get away with!  And Hugh Jackman ain't too hard to take either!!! This is a role that seems to be made for him.  Oh! if I were only 40 years younger!! Yippy Skippy!!!

B0000025T6|5.0|May 2, 2002<br />Stark.<br />That's how critics like to describe 'Nebraska'.  You'll <BR>find the word in almost every major review published <BR>during its release. \\"Stark\\"--as if they were unable to <BR>process songs without pop hooks, or cynical asides <BR>from the author, breaking up the narrative.<br />I prefer 'intimate.'  Yes, Nebraska is an album about <BR>American losers on the outs with their environments, <BR>but it doesn't depress me in the least.  It lifts me.  <BR>When it's on my earphones, I feel like I'm in the room <BR>with Bruce (without him knowing it).  The E-Street Band <BR>tried to record these songs and couldn't. That's because <BR>they were written by Bruce at a time when he was trying <BR>to figure some things out for himself (mostly just how <BR>he felt about a lot of stuff).  As a result, 'Nebraska' <BR>is the least self-conscious album Bruce has ever made.<br />And it's my favorite.  Nobody else writes with so few <BR>chords and so few words and gets so much across. This <BR>is humanism without sappiness, the hardest trick in <BR>show-biz.

B00005QZWI|3.0|I bought this CD because what I'd previously heard of Howard Shore's work sounded interesting and because Enya has two songs on the CD as well. Mr. Shore's work is good but you should see the movie first, it would probably help your enjoyment of the CD. Of his tunes I think I preferred #2 Concerning Hobbits and #17 The Breaking of the Fellowship most. I found it interesting that Enya, with only two songs on the CD, actually seems to have more visible billing here. May it Be is probably a lttle better than The Council of Elrond, I think it is the one she sang at the Oscars.

6300208591|4.0|LA DOLCE VITA presents a series of incidents in the life of Roman tabloid reporter Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni)--and although each incident is very different in content they gradually create a portrait of an intelligent but superficial man who is gradually consumed by &quot;the sweet life&quot; of wealth, celebrity, and self-indulgence he reports on and which he has come to crave.<br />Although the film seems to be making a negative statement about self-indulgence that leads to self-loathing, Fellini also gives the viewer plenty of room to act as interpreter, and he cleverly plays one theme against its antithesis throughout the film.  (The suffocation of monogamy vs. the meaninglessness of promiscuity and sincere religious belief vs. manipulative hypocrisy are but two of the most obvious juxtapositions.)  But Fellini's most remarkable effect here is his ability to keep us interested in the largely unsympathetic characters LA DOLCE VITA presents: a few are naive to the point of stupidity; most are vapid; the majority (including the leads) are unspeakably shallow--and yet they still hold our interest over the course of this three hour film.<br />The cast is superior, with Marcello Mastroianni's personal charm particularly powerful.  As usual with Fellini, there is a lot to look at on the screen: although he hasn't dropped into the wild surrealism for which he was sometimes known, there are quite a few surrealistic flourishes and visual ironies aplenty--the latter most often supplied by the hordes of photographers that scuttle after the leading characters much like cockroaches in search of crumbs.  Unfortunately, the only release now available is a grainy-looking videotape presented in pan-and-scan.  But don't let that discourage you: even in this format its still a very worth while, very memorable film!

B000002U82|5.0|This is the single greatest album ever released, and any listing of rock's greatest albums that does not have this at number 1 is no list.  I bought this album in 1993 after remembering growing up with it with my parents.  It is a mind numbing, deeply hypnotizing experience, seamlessly constructed from beginning to end.  My favorite track, due to early memories of it, is &quot;Money&quot;, though I would have to say that &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot; is an almost imperceptible distance away at second.  This is THE album to have on a desert island.
0452282152|5.0|There's a great deal to appreciate about this novel by Chevalier. Though the novel's scenario is obviously speculative (little is known about Vermeer's private life), I still feel quite comfortable calling it \\"historical fiction\\" because the author clearly took such pains to recreate everything as accurately as possible. I quite easily transportd myself to a 17th century Delft town, where I could see the people going about their daily chores. The imagery in this book is intense but not forced--and that is a clear demonstation of the writer's talent. Chevalier vividly conjures images of every detail, from the clothing styles to the prevailing sense of servitude that enveloped the novel's heroine. The way she managed to verbally describe Vermeer's attention to light, texture, and shadows amazes me.<br />The characters in this novel, I feel, are beautifully developed. Griet emerges at the end with a clear sense of survival, when she could have succumbed to defeat and humiliation. The tension betweend Catholics and protestants is yet another detail that makes Chevalier's imagined world seem real. <br />Vermeer eluded historians for centuries. Tracy Chevalier has given him a life that may be as close to the \\"truth\\" as anyone will ever be. I'll never look at a Vermeer painting the same way again.

0375507507|4.0|I picked up this book after reading various doom-and-gloom essays about 2002 politics in Zimbabwe. I thought the book might offer something other than a political diatribe from one party line or another.<br />I was right about the lack of political commentary. For a while, it looked like it would have very little to say about Africa, at all. On one level, it is just the memoir of private family tragedy from the perspective of a 5 year old.  The dedication page reads \\"to Mum, Dad, and Vanessa and to the memory of Adrian, Olivia and Richard with love\\". So, from page one, I was asking myself, who were Adrian, Olivia and Richard? Why did they die? Given this is touted as a 'war story,' I figured it involved battle deaths, but no, it's all family tragedy, stuff that could happen anywhere.<br />The author constantly maintains the voice of appropriate maturity to the age she experienced the episode. Often, this is accomplished by stringing together olfactory metaphors. The following is from page 3. The episode is titled 'Rhodesia, 1975.' The auther is 6.<br />\\"So if I wake in the night and need Mum and Dad, I call Vanessa, because she isn't armed. \\"Van! Van, hey!\\" I hiss across the room until she wakes up. And then Van has to light a candle and escort me to the loo, where I pee sleepily into the flickering yellow light and Van keeps the candle high, looking for snakes and scorpions and baboon spiders. ... the breeze has trapped midday scents; the prevalent cloying of the leach field, the green soap which has spilled out from the laundry and landed on the patted-down red earth, the wood smoke from the fires that heat our water, the boiled meat smell of dog food. We debate the merits of flushing the loo.\\"<br />This is a good example of how the author weaves the 'war' into a story of childhood memories. It is just part of the landscape. She can't go get in bed with her parents because her Dad might shoot whoever startles him.<br />With this protective screen of childhood innocence and family tragedy, we are offered a glimpse of what it is like to be an African. I hope no one minds me calling the author an African. Deciding whether of not she is African seems to be the internal debate that strings together the episodes. That's what I was looking for and I appreciate the journey.<br />I would have edited out the last 30 pages. There is no need to tidy up the loose threads to the story and the author un-wisely abandons her style of speaking from the 'era.' Here is the sentence I would have ended the book upon: \\"That night, the first night on our new farm [in Zambia], while I am sitting on the edge of my bed contemplating my new bedroom, a rat the size of a small cat runs over my foot.\\"ocence and family tragedy, we are offered a glimpse of what it is like to be an African.

B000002LCU|5.0|I purchased this CD when it came out in late 87 and I still love it very much. I rank Cloud Nine among the tops of all of the solo Beatles CD's. It is very well put together and has no weak songs on it. The song This is Love is a classic. When We Was Fab(#23on charts) and Got My Mind Set On You(#1 on charts) were both hits. To my ears however, the standout song on the whole record is the lead off track, Cloud Nine. When you hear Harrison trade guitar licks with Eric Clapton on this song, you are hearing great guitar playing. Not very many of Harrison's other records are as good as Cloud Nine, but then again, not to many others people's records are this good either.
0446677450|4.0|When I started this book, it seemed very simplistic, although written in an engaging style.  I thought what he had to say was interesting, but didn't feel it was going to tell me anything I didn't know.  But the more I read, the better I thought the book was.  By the time I finished it, it really did help me  and motivate me to change my circumstances.  He doesn't tell you what to DO in this book, although he does give plenty of examples of what he did for you to think about.  What this book is trying to do is to change your METHOD OF THINKING.  And it really succeeds, as far as I'm concerned.  He reminds me a lot of some very successful people I know in real estate, the way he thinks and talks.
B000002HGD|5.0|Shallow teeny-bopper pop? Excuse me? Listen to the lyrics of &quot;Everytime You Touch Me&quot;- do those seem shallow to you? Moby has merely realized the truth- everything truly is wrong, but that doesn't mean you have to let it put you down. And when Moby genre-bounces, it's really okay... he writes good songs no matter what style it is. Another thing... he writes his own music! Oooh! What a breakthrough! NSync is teenybopper; Moby is not. This CD is absolutly breathtaking... has ambient songs, like &quot;God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters&quot;, rave/techno (&quot;Feeling So Real&quot;) and thrash industrial punk (&quot;All That I Need Is to Be Loved&quot;). And you should respect the fact that Moby has taken an underground sound and made it accessable to the mainstream- I don't think your other techno DJ's would have the talent to be able to do that. Long live Moby.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This fantastic picture has played on my DVD player nearly every day since its release. Mulholland drive is by no means a film for the lazy of thought or close minded of souls. Lynch is not a director, he is a great artist who is able to tap into the abstact and realistic realms of life and give us a glimpse of how they are so mistaken for one another. He is perhaps the only known abstact expressionist filmmaker in the world, and Mulholland Drive is a canvas of swirling brush strokes and Jackson pollack-like drips of truth and feelings. What is real, and what is a dream? These questions are not answered, they can not be. That would be a personal opinion by the Lynch. What Lynch does, is put the perception totally in our (the viewer's) heads. The DvD comes with this great feature of a inside sleeve \\"10 clues to unlock the mystery\\", which could or could not help you. The great thing about this film is you might have a different pertcepti0on of what it is about everytime you see it. So PLEASE see this movie, it is ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FILMS made in the last twenty years. Yourt perception is needed, your opinion is valuable.

0385503954|5.0|Ian Mcewan is an accomplished writer. This work, \\"Atonement\\", was nominated for, \\"The Booker Prize\\", and while he did not win this time, he has one the award in the past. I have read two of his previous works, and while I enjoyed both they each were too brief. Extremely well done, but the ending came too quickly for such fine work. With, \\"Atonement\\", he has written a much more elaborate work, and has done so with a mischievous style that is as rewarding as it is deceptive. From beginning to end his game is in play and it makes for any substantial commentary very difficult without giving away the end of the maze.<br />The reader is confronted with an extremely precocious 13 years old whose behavior passes traditional boundaries to become almost unbelievable. I also found her to be both one of the most aggravating and easiest characters to dislike that I have come across in some time. Her introspective musings and personal observations became almost tiresome and entirely too difficult to accept. And if there is any doubt, her subsequent behaviors are beyond atrocious, or are they?<br />Not many authors can maintain a deceptively planned story with such skill, or maintain the tension to literally the closing sentences. The author has done this and more. When you reach the end you will at once feel that you have been had by a very clever pen, and then realize the ending is far from decisive and singular. A very wonderful tale.
B00005ATQE|4.0|Like everyone else, I enjoy the first half of this movie over and over and over. It is by the far the greatest 'boot camp' sequence ever filmed by Hollywood. Ermy will have you howling with laughter at every profanity infested tyrade. You can hwatch the boot camp 'mini movie' all by itself and never tire of it.<br />The second half has it's moments, but fails tragicly in comparison to the first half. If the entire movie had been boot camp, this would be one of the most watched and entertaining movies of all time.<br />5 stars for the first half<br />2 stars for the second.
B0000640VO|5.0|With its wonderfully surreal storyline, outstanding acting & breathtaking cinematography, \\"Amelie\\" is a \\"feel good\\" movie that achieves exactly what it sets out to do. An international hit and an instant \\"classic\\", its first ten minutes on their own rank as one of the funniest and most brilliantly executed sequences in any film.<br />But... for those of us unable to speak fluent French the problem is simple: the sheer speed of it's superbly witty dialogue leaves you grappling to read the subtitles and, in so doing, seriously diverts your attention away from the equally quick-paced, stunningly directed visuals. Dubbing would have helped at one level but has been wisely avoided as it would totally destroy the key feature of the film - i.e. it is, and could only be, French! The solution?... invest in your own copy. After a couple of times through (with the ever-ready option to \\"rewind\\" its more complex scenes), the memory banks take over leaving you free to relish the full impact of this quite beautiful, multi-layered work of genius.
0385505833|1.0|The only reason I can think of that this book is a best-seller is that it has John Grisham's name on it. I usually steer clear of best-sellers, anything recommended by Oprah, etc. since I usually do not like most of the books that appeal to the masses, but the storyline of this book compelled me to at least check it out of the library (thank god I didn't buy it) and give it a try.<br />First of all, although the story seems like a cute idea, the situations that play out are ridiculous, but not so over-the-top that one could tell if it was meant as satire (and from an interview I saw with Grisham , it didn't seem that it was). The characters are flat, none of them seem to have any depth or real emotion whatsoever. Furthermore, none of them even have enough of a personality for me to like them or hate them, so throughout the book, I couldn't help but feeling that I couldn't care less what happened to these people.<br />Although the characters didn't provoke much of a response from me, the culture they represented did. Unfortunately it depicts everything I hate about living in a suburb of Boston (although I am sure it is the same for most suburbs across the US). Most of the homogenous people who live there are selfish, petty, too concerned with money, and spoil their kids rotten; and this book seems to be written with them in mind, not just as a subject, but as an audience. The ending of the book makes an attempt at redeeming these people, but it is unbelievable at best, and leaves me feeling that no real epiphany (excuse the pun) has taken place, and that these people will be right back to their old ways on the 26th.<br />Although this short book doesn't take long to read, save your time and money and try something from someone whose last name isn't Grisham, Roberts, or Sparks. You may be pleasantly surprised.
630577241X|4.0|I have to confess, I had never seen a Charlie Chaplin film before I took a chance and purchased Modern Times on DVD. Why this film, you ask? I remembered it from a biography I saw of Chaplin on television. I was instantly impressed once I inserted it into my DVD player. The more I watch this cute little movie, the funnier it becomes.<br />The DVD is 1.33:1 (standard) and is in black and white. The picture is good enough for a 30's film. Oddly, the picture is &quot;cropped&quot; within a black square as if the screen were zoomed-out slightly. Chaplin wrote the score, being that this film is predominately &quot;silent&quot; (the characters raarely talk, although some do at times). There are title cards used intermittantly throughout as well. The music is very good, and confirms my opinion of Chaplin as a very multifaceted man of many talents.<br />It was a risky purchase that proved to be a wise-buy. You can be sure I will buy more Chaplin films in the future! Shame on the television networks and cable for not making me (and probably many others like me) more aware of this 20th Century icon.

0440180295|2.0|I found myself wanting to understand more about what the main character thought about the war, about the people in the war, about his relationship with his wife and kids, etc. But he seemed to think nothing at all. Billy was simply be a pawn in someone elses game, always. That's pathetic, depressing, and disturbing. I fault the author and his main character with not taking any responsability for anything. NO, we are not just pawns. We do have some control over our lives and our fates are not pre-known (we do not jump around in time so we have no idea what is going to happen to us in the future). But if you do nothing to take control of your life, you can be sure that others will take control of it for you. <br />...
B0000636UN|5.0|Much in the way Hole took a trip to Malibu for their album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, Sheryl Crow hopped a Harley and headed from the southland to the California beaches for &quot;C'mon C'mon.&quot; The album has a feeling of southern rock tinged with surf and sun. Even when the occasional storm cloud rolls in you know it's just the end of the day, not the end of the world. <br />The songs are infectious and melodic at times bringing to mind the Steve Miller Band, the Allman Brother's Band, and Fleetwood Mac.<br />The album is heavy with guest appearances including Lenny Kravitz, Liz Phair, Don Henley, Stevie Nicks, Gwyneth Paltrow, Emmylou Harris, and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, but it never seems overdone. The guest cameos serve to enhance and compliment the songs and while it might be Sheryl Crow and friends, it's definitely Sheryl Crow's album. Her vocals range from relaxed to rocking, and compliment her lyrics and music beautifully.<br />It's hard to pick highlights from an album this strong from begining to end, but 'Soak Up The Sun', 'Steve McQueen', and 'C'mon C'mon' sound like the singles to me, and those songs alone are worth the owning the album for.<br />Preview the tracks and then add the album to your cart. &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is a full album of good songs rather than the two or three hits plus filler that most albums deliver. A perfect record to bring us into a beautiful summer.<BR>Enjoy!

6302426499|5.0|Tarkovsky's &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot; is his finest achievement.  An epic masterpiece set in medieval Rus, Soviet officials originally butchered it cutting out almost an hour of it's content.<br />Rublev is the cinematic equal to the great novels of our time.  The idealism of an artist, then monk, is confronted by the ravages of the era.  His response to his environment and his final reconciliation is itself a part of the story.<br />There are so many scenes of beauty, imagery and stark violence that are so well done and so detailed that it will leave the thoughtful viewer wondering what other movie is Rublev's equal.  The scene of the slaughter of the pagans is cruel and beautiful at the same time.<br />This is art as cinema and not for every viewer.  Tarkovsky relies on the viewer intelligence and on the viewers own ability to make his/her mind up on their own understanding of the film.  Like all of Tarkovsky's films he never makes it easy for his viewers.  He assumes intelligence and a willingness your part to find meanings.<br />One of the greatest films ever made and very, very Russian.
0684800713|5.0|The only other Hemingway book I have ever read was \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" but this was far better. Hemingway worked hard to write his stories. And the result shows in this one. Not much plot except the constant running around France and Spain drinking all the time. Probably a lot like Hemingway's life was. His descriptions of the countryside are amazing and you can almost visualize the landscape. The British fellow Michael was by far the funniest character and he reminded me of Cary Grant. Overall I thought I wouldn't like the book because I'm not an \\"affecion\\" or however you spell it about Bull Fights. (In fact I detest them.) The story wasn't about bull fights. It was a love story that could never happen. I found myself coming in from work and grabbing right for the book. I'm young and I don't usually read but this book was captivating to me. I really enjoy reading books set in this era and have yet to see a modern day author put together a book as good as Hemingway or Steinbeck. Until then I will stick with the classics!

After reading the book I fine tuned the process (and still refresh myself from time to time) but even with some mistakes, that first resolution brought on such relief for both of us that my husband noticed the difference when he got home that day...and I hadn't told him anything about it.<BR> <BR>At first I used holding to get through the rages. That lasted a little more than a week, then I did them prophylactically, daily for about 2 weeks. Then a few times a week, then weekly then finally only when I detected her dis-connection to us. June will be the two year anniversary of our adoption and Regina has only needed holding twice since Christmas.<BR> <BR>While I am often stressed out and angry when we need to do a holding, I'm not angry once we start, the whole process gives me back the parental role and \\"control\\" and allows me to be loving. Once we achieve resolution we have great long gazes and she reacts EXACTLY as you described in your book. And now we work hard on some \\"lite\\" face time each day.<BR>  <BR>Again, sincere thanks for your book...every time I see my daughter with a happy content connected look on her face I have you to thank.
B00005RIKD|5.0|A must have for any Sting fan. Superb &quot;reinterpretations&quot; of classic Sting and Police songs(the new version of &quot;Hounds of Winter&quot; is worth the price alone). This CD truly showcases Sting's musical genius. Highly recommended.
0201633612|5.0|I had heard quite a bit of rattle about design patterns.  Reading the book made the rattle sensible.  However, as nothing is perfect, it would have been great if there was discussion about scenarios in which more than one pattern could have been used and how would each scenario fare.  Well, such thing can make a book by itself.  However, such comparison makes it easier to comprehend the application of patterns which is harder than understanding a pattern in a given example.  Anyways, this is something that a software engineer would need to read before embarking on large projects.
0767824571|5.0|This movie is a quest into the most ridiculous territory ever before.  Follow the heroes on their wild goose chase for a holy grail, but be ever ware of the dangers!  Yes!  Dangers lurch in every corner such as laughing yourself into a massive heart attack or falling off your chair and busting your scull and worse be laughing so hard you never even know it!  If you don't laugh at this I don't believe you!  Not only is it hilarious to blow the three stooges out of the water it's also plotted just about well enough to beat Matrix!!  If you buy this don't say I didn't warn you:  You'll love it!
B000002UB3|4.0|A melange of all things good about the Beatles. More sprawling than even the double album 'The Beatles', it is a smorgasbord of Beatle delights.<br />Many people believe that 'Something' should have been the first track on this album but Lennon's blues number is superb.<br />Something is exquisite. No more to be said.<br />Highlights of this album for me include the synthesiser used in Here Comes the Sun' to such wonderful effects, the fact that this was the first album to be released in stereo only in the UK, and the medley of songs which made up side two of the vinyl album.<br />PLEASE APPLE RE-RELEASE ALL OF THE APPLE PRODUCT ON CD.<br />The history of the band in Germany shows up in Paul's delivery of 'She Camr in Through the Bathroom Window', and the last four tracks are all excellent songs.<br />'The End', an album early seems a forlorn hope of reconciliation but recognises that whatever their personal differences they still loved one another.<br />As Joni Mitchell pointed out &quot;you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone&quot;.<br />A must for everyone's collection. Peace, John and George. We miss you.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album truly broke the curve in modern rock albums. Not a single cd that I've heard has combined punk and good, old rock in such a way. Singer Julian Casablancas combines his one of a kind voice with smooth guitar lines of Albert Hammond Jr., not to overshadow the catchy drum beats and bass lines. One cannot help but notice the wonderfully arranged musical masterpiece of these New York old schoolers. Taking on a some sort of a Nirvana-like roll, they seem to be the one band that can bring good, old style rock back to the top. There's not a single track worth skipping on this whole album. It's one of the very rare cd's, that you can listen to from end to end repeatedly, and never get tired of it. This cd has much lived up to the hype, and maybe a little more. All in all, I reccommend this album to anybody with ears, and even a few who don't.
0517122707|4.0|For me this novel was all about momentum.  It started out rough, but then picked up until by the end I wanted more.  Think Toole found his stride about a third of the way through.  The ending left me feeling like if he wouldn't have committed suicide, we'd certainly have gotten to see more of Ignatius &amp; &quot;that minx&quot; as a mismatched frenetic (as opposed to 'dynamic') duo.  A-
B00005JLF5|5.0|DS9 is without a doubt the most mature series of Star Trek.  Please release this on DVD.  DS9 isn't even shown in reruns so how are we supposed to see the show?  I give this DVD 5 Stars and the whole show 5 stars because it's awesome.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I LOVED THIS CD I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STOP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM.I LIKE HIM A LOT BETTER THAN RICKY MARTIN HE'S OKAY IT'S JUST HE DOESN'T WRITE HIS SONGS HE'S SUPPOSED TO ON HIS NEXT ALBUM BUT WE'LL SEE.ANYWAY BACK TO MY REVIEW THEIR IS ONE SONG ON THE ALBUM THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BUT I WON'T SAY WHICH.ANYWAY EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS CD IT IS AMAZING.
6304578482|4.0|This is a &quot;chick flick&quot; that even guys can love.  It's a slight and common story, but performed by two funny, attractive, engaging actresses.<br />Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino play former high school nerds who want to show up everyone at their high school reunion, proving that they &quot;made it big&quot; in life (although they didn't).<br />In one hilarious vignette, Romy and Michelle argue over which of them is the &quot;Mary&quot; and which is the &quot;Rhoda.&quot;  &quot;I'm the Mary, I'm the pretty one!&quot; one finally says, quickly regretting it.  Although they're going to their high school reunion, these ditzy women are still thinking with high school maturity.  (Naturally, in the end, they learn to &quot;accept themselves&quot; and not listen to the cool crowd).<br />Lisa Kudrow created the &quot;Romy and Michelle&quot; characters in her pre-Friends, comedy improv days.
B000002JS0|5.0|The year wass 1976. Heavy metal was on the way down, and pop rock and disco was on the way up. (When the kings of metal, Black Sabbath, release an album as bad as Technical Ecstacy, you know there is something wrong). The biggest acts of the year were the Eagles, Boston, Fleetwood Mac, and Peter Frampton. Then came five Aussie boys, playing some of the raunchiest rawk and roll since the Stones.<br />Make no mistake, this has no synthesizers or keyboards or studio excess of other rock acts. The only time they stray away from guitars, vocals, bass, and drums is on the first track in which rock's ultimate cartoon character (Bon Scott) plays the bagpipes! The album is about sex, booze, partying, and of course all out rock and roll! There are anthems a plenty, with classics like It's a long way to the Top and High Voltage. The Young brothers strut their stuff, and prove they are the greatest riff makers in the business, and Bon Scott proves he is one of the greatest frontmen AROUND! Basically the album is a forty minute way of telling to to PAAAARRRRRRRRRRTYYYYY!<br />So if you want a reprieve from the bubblegum pop, hip hop, and nu metal that surrounds you today then go for one of the greatest debut albums ever! This is one that left an everlasting impact on rock and roll who brought it back to the way it was meant to be; simple, raw, sleazy, and LOUD!! With this AC/DC became the undisputed kings of metal, and forever left their mark on the world with this and albums to come! (If You Want Blood, Let There Be Rock, Powerage, Highway to Hell, and Back in Black would follow! You can't live another day without this classic! Get it today!
0971855110|5.0|Basically I've been expected to keep house since I was a very little girl, but I was never actually shown how to keep up on house work. As a single gal, it wasn't a problem, but enter kids, pets, and hubby, and I found housekeeping to be one of the great mysteries of the world. I realized that something needed to be done when I was facing yet another round of crisis cleaning due to out of town guests. Frankly, it was getting way old, and that's when I started asking around about how other people handle the housecleaning. You'd be amazed how many people use Flylady from her website! So, I checked it out, and I was impressed at the way the cleaning was broken down. The morning and evening routines are a good place to start, and the zones are a great way to continue. I've used the motto of, &quot;just 15 minutes&quot; to cover a lot of areas in my life, including house work. I mean, I can do just about anything for 15 minutes, right?<br />It's the kind of system that someone who finds housekeeping confusing can understand. If you didn't do, or couldn't do, everything in the book, you'd still be better off than you are now. I have physical disabilities, and I find that a lot of the basics are things even I can do. Flylady and I have locked horns about some non-housecleaning issues, but despite that, I cannot fault her system. It is very workable, and easy to follow. I am actually getting rid of my little shrine of organizing books, and relying solely on her system. I find that it is working for me, without being some magic wand or anything. Just practical, and easy to follow.
B00005QIPH|2.0|C'mon people, if nonsensical & inaudible lyrics, hastily composed rock songs, and some off-key singing is your idea of a good rock band, I'd stop buying CD's if I were you.  My words may be considered an attack on alt/rock/indie music, but I've been listening to rock for practically my entire life, and I just don't think The Strokes have put together a very good album.  At least not one that's worth spending [the money] on.<br />I gave the Strokes \\"Is This It\\" a few spins, here is the chronological progression of my review.<br />First spin: \\"Interesting sound.  A few catchy songs.  Nice to hear a different alternative sound.\\"<br />Second spin: \\"A few creative guitar riffs.  A little off-key singing.  A few slightly annoying songs.\\"<br />Third spin: Skip, skip, skip, \\"this one's okay\\", skip, \\"irritating\\", skip, skip, skip...<br />Fouth spin: On second thought, I think I'll throw in something else.<br />I will admit this album contains a few catchy tunes, and a differnt approach to modern rock, but please don't compare them to the Velvet Underground!  I for one just can't see their sound lasting for very long.  Unless you're in love with The Strokes, I'd recommend trying a little 'Stephen Malkmus' instead.
0451191153|5.0|When I first read \\"The Fountainhead\\" by Ayn Rand it was given to me as a graduation gift from one of my teachers.  I fell in love with it as soon as I finished.  It is the portrayal of a moral ideal as an end in itself. Rand has placed 'man-worship' above all and has brought out the significance of the heroic in man. Man-worshippers are those who see man's highest potential and strive to actualize it. The Fountainhead has brought out the greatness of man - the capacity, the ability, the integrity and honesty in man - as an ideal to be achieved. It is based on the idea of romanticism which means that, \\"It is concerned not with things as they are but with things as they might be and ought to be.\\" <BR>The Fountainhead is the story of an architect, Howard Roark-, whose genius and integrity was as unyielding as granite and of his desperate battle waged against the conventional standards of society. It is a tale of hatred and a story about society and how it's against a man.  Ayn Rand's daringly original philosophy of 'objectivism' is the base of The Fountainhead. The motive and purpose of her writing is to bring forward the most challenging ideas that man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.  This piece of literature is great for anyone that is stepping into something new and unexplored lifestyle.
B00005JKCF|4.0|This movie is just that, pure fun.  Now, as a once avid reader of the comic books, I knew the story already, but I won't spoil it for people who've never heard of Spider-Man before.  Even though it was a moderately predictable movie for anyone who's read the story, it doesn't take away from the fun.  What DID take away only minimally was the obvious product placement.  I mean, Pete practices aiming his webs on a Dr. Pepper can, come on.  And when the Green Goblin attacks the people at the festival, they always show wide shots of him going around all of the billboards for Cingular, Samsung, and so on.  I mean, come ON guys.  But, what are you gonna do, right?  The acting and script are on par with the comic book, and that means that it's moderately lame.  But, then again, you're not gonna see this movie for acting, you're gonna see it for ACTION, and this movie's got boatloads of it.  Trust me when I say this, the Cinematography is EXCELLENT.  Especially when Peter's chasing the robber.  Absolutely brilliant.  And I am very pleased that they didn't change Spidey's costume, but the Goblin's costume is...very blecch.  People will not be disappointed with this movie, not even fans who've been reading Spider-Man for 30 years.  Thus movie's pure fun and you'll want to see it over and over as much as you can, which is exactly what those people with the product placements want.  But, again, what are ya gonna do?
B000002KHF|5.0|I don't think I could be friends with anyone who does not at least like this album. And I couldn't be good friends with anyone who didn't own it.  It's just THAT good. Some may say it's &quot;poppy&quot;, or not his best work. I say , everyone is entitled to their opinion, even if they are wrong . I happen to be right about this album.<br />My personal opinion is that he hasn't had a bad album. The man is a great songwriter, interpreter of others' songs, and a fantastic singer. Every song on this album is classic Caledonian soul.
0060392886|5.0|What can I say.. this book was excellent.  I grew up listening to the Crue and was always fascinated by them.  Now I finally get to read about their tales of women, drugs, booze and rock & roll.  If you are a Crue fan or any hard rock fan, you will not be disappointed if you read this book.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I truly loved this movie. I am an American who was saved in a little, dusty Brazilian church years ago, and my soul has never forgotten it's first home or language.<br /> Central Station shines in its ability to capture the ache and isolation that all people feel. The two characters grate against each other, but as time passes and troubles mount, the hardened and scarred areas of their hearts are what wear away, and they are able to love each other without pretense. The ending left me weeping unabashedly. Tears streamed down my face and my heart felt shattered. Sometimes, loving someone means putting the other person ahead of you to the extent that you suffer greatly.<br /> And yet, the pain I felt was good. I rejoiced as they each remembered the day at Bom de Jesus. Life on earth can hurt, but in addition to fellowship with the Lord Himself, the love of friends can carry us through the loneliest, saddest moments. Watch Central Station and feel renewed in your desire to love your friends honestly.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Freakin amazing is all i can pretty much say about this album! With most bands churning out the same style of music today, either punk or rock/rap, its good to know that someone can still crank out some good ole 80's hard rock! I seriously thought that the video for \\"She Is Beautiful\\" was from like 10 years ago, I was wrong. If you don't have this CD now, I heartily suggest you go out today and buy it.
B00005A1VH|3.0|This was a very good film about the stuggle of conviction with duty.  As such, it stand out rather well.  Unfortunatly it only deals with the ( undeniable ) courage of York and only poorly with his character.  York was a dim bulb ( a fundamentalist, even), uneducated, and childlike, but he had a great deal of courage and conviction that this film only touches upon.  The depths of Yorks convictions are only touched upon in the film ( as really lame arguments lead him to put them aside, historically accurate or not, I do not know).  But it fails to recognize ( not by ignoreing but by ending) the deomonstrations of his convictions after the war.  York turned down the fortune his celebrity could have brought and instead used his fame to furthur education ( a value he learned during the war ), beliefs in pacifism, to passionetly espouse a sometimes shifting political ideology.    The bravery that York demonstrated during the war are admirable but is understandable in a man who did what he belived in with no thought to himself.  While his unfortunate educational and intellectual limitations may have made these things subject to rapid change and new positions with equal devotion, the strength of will and the devotion to do what one belives is right is admirable.  Yes, he flip-floped alot becuase he could be easily persuaded, but the intellectual flip-flop, too, bucause they understand one side today, another tommarow.  Few, however, show the decication to their ideals, even when they contradict the past (persumed) errors, than York.  The film shows his bravery, but does not even begin to demonstrate, within his limits, his integrity.
0792844890|4.0|The reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the language.  Although it isn't really bad I wouldn't suggest kids younger than 13 to watch it.  But it is A FUNNY  SPOOF. &quot;I Know the SHWARTZ!&quot;  Really funny. I like it.
0312243022|5.0|Michael Cunningham is nothing short of a genius.  I devoured \\"The Hours\\" in record time, despite having to put it down several times to reflect on some of the most beautifully written, simple and eloquent passages I have ever read.  <br />I have read almost every book of fiction to have won the Pulitzer, and I can say without hesitation that this book is the at the top of that elite list.
B00005JKCF|3.0|If you're a Spider-Man fan, you know the story.  If you're not a fan, wait until this movie comes out on video, otherwise you may be disappointed.  With just a little creative license this movie follows the comic book to a \\"T\\" as far as how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, and what happens to his Uncle Ben.  The action in the movie is there, and like the comic there's a lot of \\"slow\\" drama between the action.  Out of a 2-hour movie (including the credits), there is about 20-30 minutes of action.  The rest is characters taking to each other, and making pleasantries.  One of the other reviews I read here is about the Green Goblin.  It states that Mr. Defoe is hidden behind a mask that doesn't move when he talks, etc.  While this is true, if you pay attention you can see his mouth behind the mask, so it does not detract from his acting abilites or your enjoyment of the film.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because the preview trailers contain almost all of the action seqences in the movie (which lets you know it is more drama than action).
B000002V07|4.0|Her voice is dark, soothing and romantic at the same time.  It's not the most upbeat album, but it's still a good buy.
0451191153|4.0|This is not for fans of Steven King.  Sorry, but I couldn't help responding to &quot;Brenners&quot; review.  I found this book to be intelligent, interesting, relatively fast moving, and educational.  The characters are exagerated and intense, which helps get the point of the story across.  The underlying dicussion is good.  Egotism vs. Altruism and the individual vs. the collective.  There is good drama along the way.  I don't know if you will love any of the characters, maybe Howard Roark,  but you will definitey loath and maybe pity some of the others.  Also, don't be afraid of the  700 plus pages.  You will be done before you know it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|It was my first smashing pumpkings purchase and I still believe it's their best.  It has the basic's that everyone knows and loves, including hard rock songs as well as some mystical and soothing sounds.
B00003CY6M|1.0|It's like a college freshman's attempt at a Tracy/Hepburn film.  Can one hang an entire tale on a used-to-be-trendy restaurant?  Can one hope to add artistic/intellectual credibility by tossing in a Gabriel Garcia Marquez book as a plot device?  One can certainly try, and someone did, but the results are beyond disappointing.<br />John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Jeremy Piven, and Eugene Freakin' Levy?!?  Was this movie a trade-off for other projects they wanted to do?  All four are accomplished, smart, talented actors but this flick was a D - O - G dog.  I don't expect much depth out of a romantic comedy but it isn't much fun when you can not only predict what's going to happen, but you can actually predict what the actors are going to say minutes before they say it.<br />Without John Cusack attached to it, I doubt this beast would pass muster as a Lifetime Television Movie.
B00000K19E|5.0|I'm not really sure why I'm even writing this review, because everyone all ready knows that The Matrix is one of the best movies to ever come out, but just figured I'd give my 2 cents anyway.  This movie has so much action that it's incredible.  It also has some of the best special effects I've seen in a very long time, and the storyline is amazing.  Who ever wrote the story for the movie, is a genius and I hope is coming back for the other 2 movies.  Before the sequels come out, make sure you get the one that started it all.
B000056K04|4.0|I really like this CD. I honestly dont care about what all the others are saying(oh, i liked his old stuff), I dont care really. Dave Matthews could do any genre of music that he wanted and it would turn out better than most of the artists around today. <br />There are a lot of songs I like on this CDs, but none are my favorite, Crash Into Me will always be my favorite, I dont even think Dave can change that. But there are many of them I like. Believe it or not, my fav song on this CD is What You Are. I think the lyrics sound like lyrics for music on a diversity commercial, but the funky sound(I dont know what it actually is) is really cool. Everyday comes in a close second, since it is pretty much old school Dave. So Right and I Did It are the other favorites. I just absolutely cant stand Angel and Mother Father. Too much pop in it for me. <br />I give it a 4 out of 5 mainly because this CD has monutmental highs(What You Are, So Right) and Monutmental Lows (Angel and Mother Father.)
6303421563|3.0|In \\"The Professional\\", Leon (Jean Reno) is a hit man who can go anywhere and kill people without drawing a single bullet. He specializes in walking (almost as if out of walls or thin air)right up to his victims before the killing blow. Nothing about Leon explains why he is so singularly sucessful at the art of breaking, entering and killing and when off duty, we learn that his life is simply a slower version of the death he inflicts on others. He lives in a crumbling Manhattan apartment, sleeping upright and wearing Reno's trademark sunglasses. He has no friends or family and his life boils down to catching old movies in revival houses and caring for his plant. Tony (Danny Aiello), Leon's only contact with the outside world, is also his \\"agent\\". When Leon's neighbors are almost entirely killed by a squad of crooked cops led by the thoroughly evil Detective Stansfield (over the top Gary Oldman), the sole survivor of the murdered family, Mathilda (Natalie Portman) runs to Leon for help.  Free of both her family and apparently feeling secure from their killers, Mathilda is doubly over-joyed to learn of Leon's special career, and nurtures her own budding dreams of revenge. The two reach an understanding - Mathilda will keep house while Leon trains her in the art of murder. Leon starts her off with a sniper-rifle, educating her on the ethos of assassination - in which expertise is measured by your proximity to your target. (You start with the rifle, but master the art with a knife.) On a deeper level, Leon gives Mathilda something to live for while Mathilda gives Leon somebody to live with. In one classic scene, the two play charades - neither of the two capable of reaching imagery the other can readily understand until Mathilda does Chaplin. Life appears idyllic, considering Leon's bleak surroundings, but that doesn't last long. Probably hoping to wean Mathilda from her dreams of revenge, Leon restrains her impulses, but apparently not enough. When Mathilda goes lookingfor Stansfield, he ensnares her.  Unfortunately, Leon rescues her the only way he knows how - by executing her captors. With the multiple execution of rogue officers by a mysterious Italian hitman who walks right up to his victims coupled with the realization that Mathilda is still alive, Stansfield realizes that he's left unfinished business. Leon, once the hunter, is now the prey.<br />\\"The Professional\\" is sort of an art-house action flick, like \\"La Femme Nikita\\" (which also had Jean Reno playing a hired killer), though it gets very slow in the middle, and even the climax is too long drawn out to speed things up. (commercials for this flick had a shot of a tear-gas rocket in flight across a hallway quickly cuts to a mammoth pillar of fire blowing out the front entrance of Leon's building; two events are really separate, and the action is actually slow in the final blow-out). Natalie Portman is haunting as Mathilda, but she clues us in that something is wrong with her before her family is gunned down (she wears trashy clothes and cuts classes; when intercepting a call from school, Mathilda answers back that she's been killed). Still, the film works on the bond that the childlike Leon forges with the pre-adolescent Mathilda, underscoring a poignant closing.
B00005B36H|3.0|I felt compelled to write this review because I got a little tired of everyone making this album out to be the best album in the last ten years or something.  It's not.  It's not the best album of 2001, and it's not Tool's best.  In fact, it's Tool's worst.  Lateralus fell into the same trap for me as Star Wars Episode I:  there was so much hype and such a long wait that it was bound to disappoint.  When I first got Lateralus, I was amazed, thinking they had somehow topped Aenima, which IS one of the best albums of the last decade.  However, after awhile I noticed a strange thing:  I never wanted to put Lateralus into my CD player.  Whenever I did put it in, I just listened to The Grudge and Parabol/Parabola and took it back out.  Why?  Because Lateralus ultimately turns out to be a weak rehashing of the formula of greatness that Tool reached with Aenima.  It ends up sounding like an album of Aenima B-sides.  Except for the Grudge, (which is absolutely amazing), Parabol/Parabola (equally amazing), Schism, and perhaps Disposition/Reflection, all of the songs on this disc ended up disappointing me. For some reason everyone is blown away by this record, but I can't understand why.  Tool already did this kind of stuff thousands of times better on Aenima, a disc that never gets old.  To this day, I never find myself wanting to listen to Lateralus.  Still, even though it disappointed me, it is one of the top 5 albums of 2001, and better than 99% of the useless garbage people accept as popular music now.  That's how good Tool is; their worst album still earns three stars from me, and Lateralus makes my list of the top 5 cds of 2001 AND the most disappointing 5.  For Tool fans this CD is certainly a must have, and it is a great record as far as the music industry now is concerned.  As for it being a revolutionary, groundbreaking, or emotionally and spiritually stunning masterpiece, don't count on it.  I suppose to the average rock fan who has been weaned on nu-metal nausealike Slipknot,Limp Bisquick, and Kid Rock this record is like a message from the Gods, but to those who truly appreciate good music and Tool's music in particular, I'd have to say they could have done better.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It is one of the BEST movies ever made! The songs are really fun. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John make such a cute couple.
B00005TT77|5.0|If you are a fan of the Beatles then this is a must have album. The Beatles covers done on this album are absolutely wonderful. There are only two songs which I am not completely sold on the covers, but overall this is an excellent addtion to your Beatles collection musically. The songs on this album complement the movie and are able to take you back to the scenes in the movie as if you are watching it again.
0790734850|5.0|This should have won best picture over Titanic in 1998. Titanic is an excellent film but this film is much more smart and enjoyable and it is unique. It has good acting from all roles and the people they picked for the parts were right on. It also has a good soundtract that's kind of fun to listen to. The story involves around a murder where nothing is as it seems to be. It tells you that all cops are not good. That gives you a good lesson on cops being the boss of everything. Well there are some bad cops out there too and it really tells you that in the best way. L.A. Confidential is one of my top 3 favorite films and I would recommend it to everyone!
B00005R8FI|3.0|I just bought this CD, after owning the vinyl way back then. I loved it back then. The musicians are excellent, really excellent.     Now that I've gotten older perhaps, or started listening to lyrics more, I'd have a greater opinion of the cd if only the lyrics could be removed. They are way below par to the music being produced, and seem to constantly revolve around Mayall trying to use his star status to get laid in town to town, with no strings attached. Maybe one song like this would fly, but FIVE? Were it not for this, it would have gotten 5 stars from me.    I can't even listen to it now.    Perhaps I'll just go get a Mark-Almond CD to tide me over.
B00005JXY3|5.0|This is my favorite film in the Karate kid series, edging out part 1, and heavily favored over part 3. Taking the story back to Japan, and getting Miyagi heavily involved were excellent touches that pushed this film over the top. The music is faaannntastic. I can not even begin to describe the greatness of this musical score. Daniel's love interest is beautiful, and Chozen is one of the greatest, most evil bad guys in the history of cinema. If Asian actors were more accepted in Hollywood, that guy would be regarded as one of the finest actors in the game. But, I digress. The best in the series, and a must see for all ages.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Although some of us don't really care all that much about them, there are always going to be trends in popular music, and Wilco's latest recording is a perfect example of what's apparently coming down the pike.  A few years ago--specifically, in the mid- to late-eighties--bands like Big Audio Dynamite began incorporating sample-snippets from old movies, aging classical recordings and even voices right off the streets into otherwise normal songwriting.  The initial effect, of course, was refreshing and often eye-opening.  But after a few years, the technique seems dated, the novelty having faded.  <br />Now, in the wake of Radiohead's overrated &quot;O.K. Computer,&quot; bands in both Great Britain and America are incorporating electronic buzzes, feedback and other gee-gaws--all of them designed to give regular songs a sense of impact, intensity and depth the songs otherwise wouldn't present to listeners.  If you doubt that's happening, take a look at the slew of groups issuing from England, Scotland and Ireland that critics are comparing to Radiohead: Elbow, for example, owes plenty to Pink Floyd and even more to early works by Genesis; Doves does a number on eighties-era new wave; and Travis spins harmless little ditties that have been amplified by special effects into seamlessly arid pieces of ear-candy.  Now, Wilco's entered the fray.<br />Not that this recording's breaking any really new ground.  The songs are regular songs.  The presentation is odd.  The lyrics are good.
0345350499|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing to me. It was the kind of book that I found myself wishing it would never end. Even though I knew the tale of King Arthur, Bradley took the story and gave it so much depth and so many dimensions that I found myself riveted. Crying with them, laughing with them, and hating them all the same. Bradley took the mystical element out of the myth and made it real, poignant, and very human.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein are the best heavy metal band in the world! <br />Their musical content is unmatched, their vocalist is unrivaled, their lyrics are spine chilling, their lyrics are in German. Their overall musical package is formidable. Following Herzeleid(Heartache), and Sehnsucht(Longing), Rammstein are back with their 3rd musical onslaught - Mutter(Mother). This album is their best work yet, Rammstein is a band that just seems to get better &amp; better as time passes. Chock full of Heavy Guitar work and Screaching Leads, combined with Hard Bass &amp; Shattering Drum solos, mixed in with brutal keyboard passages, Mutter is an album well worth it. Every song is superb, with all the heavyness head bangers require, and the chilling gothic atmosphere night-crawlers need.<br />The best album in my Heavy Metal Collection to date.<br />Give it a try - and feel the power of Rammstein!
B00005JKCF|2.0|The acting is great. The computer animation is awful. Every time Kristen Dunst comes on screen, the camera focuses on her chest...
B00003CXTG|2.0|After seeing the trailer of \\"Pearl Harbor\\", I had very high expectations of the film.  I kept thinking that it would set a new standard for war films, with brilliant special effects and a stunning reanactment of the infamous Japanese ambush.  Unfortunatley, after an opening night screening, I left the theatre very dissapointed.  I had left with nothing I had wanted to see, and plenty of images of stuff that could have been left out to make the movie a lot better (and shorter).<BR>Right from the beginning, Michael Bay (the director) gives us over sentimental images that have nothing to do with Pearl Harbor.  The father of Josh Hartnet's character (at the age of 6 or 7) talks about fighting in the trenches in WWI after Ben Affleck's child likeness accuses him of being a \\"German\\".  \\"No one should have to see what I've seen,\\" he says.  Probably there to develop the plot, the scene serves no purpose but to introduce the two male stars.<BR>Cut to 1941 with the over-used film reel, we find Hartnett and Affleck have become ace fighter pilots who enjoy showing off their skills in front of the younger pilots.  Soon, nurses show up for no apparent reason and prepare the fighter squadron for war.  Affleck falls for Kate Beckinsale in a terribly sappy scene involving too much medicine and a champagne bottle.<BR>Anyway, soon Affleck leaves to fly for the British.  Eventually (after more sap than should be morally allowed by any director, a love trianlge between Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale develop (its a bit too difficult to explain without giving away the first hour and a half).  <BR>But all this supposed character develpment takes a backseat when the pyrotechnics begin.  Throughout the film, we're treated to Japanese viewpoints that are supposed to tell the reason they attacked Pearl Harbor, but in the end, the screenwriters just end up rewriting history completely.  <BR>Cut to Japanese fighters skimming over the Hawiian landscape, which at first, is very well shot.  Between the camera following the bomb down into the U.S.S. Arizona, and the shot of a women hanging out her clothes to dry who is suddenly buzzed by low flying aircraft, it seems Bay might actually know what he's doing.  But then people start to get shot, and fall into the water without any trace of blood.  Nurses struggle to save the wounded, but some camera filter that blurs the edges of the screen prevent us from seeing anything to gruesome to warrant a PG-13 rating by the MPAA.  This bombing continues for about half an hour, and throughout the whole attack, war heroes are glorified and bloody slaughter of Americans is turned into a music video for Hans Zimmer's emotional score (the high point of the film) without any blood.  Now, I'm not trying to endorse violence on screen, but when one tries to make a historically accurate film, you must wonder why the water is so clear, despite the hundreds of people in it, whom you are shot many a time by the 30mm aircraft guns.  In the age of Saving Private Ryan, you expect more realism in war violence, but you won't find it here.<BR>The movie continues on for another hour (too much more to describe fully).  Overall, this is really a terrible film.  Even the incredible special effects can't save this movie from its terrible amount of sap and violence thats been toned down to a point where families can happily see it together.  If this is the future of historical war dramas, you can bet I won't be in line for a ticket.
0446677450|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend (She had not read it - she saw it on a TV program).  It sounded very interesting and worth my time and money.  I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend it to you.  I have read many personal finance books and other books.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the worst example of a book I have ever encountered.  Kiyosaki's arguments were strung together poorly.  He was difficult to follow since he often repeated himself and delved into irrelevant tangents.  Most infuriating to me was the fact that he obviously didn't have anyone proof-read this book before it went to print... I counted glaring typos on almost every other page!  I finally gave up on trying to get through it and have since heard that this book bears a striking similarity to The Millionaire Next Door (it is even rumored that there may never have been a \\"Rich Dad\\" at all for Kiyosaki).  I haven't read that yet, but plan to soon.  I expect it will be a better read.  The only positive thing I can say is congratulations to the author for getting rich off of selling this [stuff] to all of us!
1878424319|5.0|This book is a poetic and concise introduction to Toltec practices. It provides very basic tenets of a much more complex series of shamanic teachings that if followed, allow one to expand one's perceptual horizons and experience a life of serenity and balance. For those interested in learning more about shamanism and building upon this basic foundation I recommend 'The Path' (Esmeralda Arana) and 'Shaman, Healer, Sage' (Alberto Villoldo). These books introduce the reader to more advanced shamanic practices that lead to acquiring perceptual powers such as telepathy, clairvoyance and healing.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just got back from seeing the movie and it got standing ovations from evrybody at the end credits.  (Including me!)  I'm not a heavy Spiderman fan, or of comic books in general.  (Heck, I've never really even touched a comic book before.)  But I watched all the 90's Spiderman cartoon's and played the PC games and that's enough to know how the comic books go and judge the movie...and it was right on!  The story was well written, the acting was top-notch, and the web-slinging effects and fighting scenes were the best I've ever seen in a movie.  People who are hardcore Spidey fans should like it too, since the movie goes by the book...the comic book that is!  (Except for how Peter develops his web-slinging abilities.  Instead of web-shooters, the ability comes along with all the rest of his powers from the spider bite.)  That's the one and only thing I wish they would have kept the same from the comic books.  Anyway, you can't please everybody, which will probably come out in reviews.  But let me tell you, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  It is definately worth the money and you won't be disappointed.
B000001FY7|5.0|Marley took some criticism for his mellow approach on this album (which he was soon to answer with the militant &quot;Survival&quot;), but &quot;Kaya&quot; has always been my favorite of Island's Marley albums. This album proves Marley's versatility and talent were very real.<br />Hints of militancy are still in the air, but Marley's mellow side is intriguing and makes for terrific listening. One of the all-time great reggae albums and certainly a must for any reggae collection.
0066620996|5.0|I am not a businessman but I found this book intriguing.  Quite frankly, I normally am bored by management books and have a hard time finishing leadership books but I couldn't put Collins book down. Personally I believe the principles he lays out are applicable to my ministry as I want to help those under me build great movements. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a passion about something and wants to be the best they can be at it no matter what it might be.

067101756X|5.0|This is the best UFO book I have read to date. It puts the entire government conspiracy into perspective with the cold war and the U.S. fear of communist takeover. <br />If you ask yourself who invented the cotton gin, you probably know. But, the greatest inventions of our time such as silicon based computer chips and fiber optics, as well as lasers are not attributed to inventors. That is because, as Corso so generously enlightens us, we stole the technology from aliens... <br />Having read a number of UFO books, my favorites are 'Alien Rapture,' 'Unconventional Flying Objects, and 'Alien Agenda,' I was drawn to this book because the Roswell crash was never really explained in any great detail. This book does just that and plenty more. <br />This book re-writes history in relation to the cold war, the development of the US as a superpower and its ultimate victory in the cold war. If you only read one book about UFO's or as Corso calls them EBE's this is the one. It gets you right inside the secrets held by the US military and the way the roswell crash helped to develop new technologies from laser beams to bullet proof jackets. <br />In comparison, I noticed in 'Alien Rapture' and from his web page that Mr. Fouche copyrighted and disclosed much of the information that Mr. Corso talks about in this book, before Mr. Corso came out with his book. Check out this other book for balance and read up on fouchemedia.com/arap/  I highly recommend this book to any reader.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|this was not good at all. just a dumb excuse for a docudrama. its so slow even i could write it better. its really the worst movie ever.
0385335482|4.0|I bought this book simply because I've never read books about shopping addiction. But after reading it, you'll find out(Just like me) that shopping addiction is just...well, terrible.<br />Becky Bloomwood, the main character of this novel, is seriously addicted to shopping. While reading it, not only did I laugh out loud, but also keep wondering, &quot;Why can't she just buy less??? Will she STOP wasting her money anyway???&quot; But this is what makes the book interesting. Kinsella took us to a journey through Becky's mind, and that makes all of us stop to consider about our &quot;bad&quot; shopping habits. Quite a light reading, enjoy it.
B00004W50Z|4.0|When this first came out in '69 or '70, I was in my serious Band infatuation stage, and so rather uncritically fell in love with this album. For me, though, it hasn't stood the test of time as do 'Music from Big Pink' and 'The Band'. The lyrics are mostly just as good as what we find on those first two albums, but some of the new melodies don't have nearly the inventiveness of the majority of the old. In my opinion, \\"Time to Kill\\", \\"Just Another Whistle Stop\\", \\"The Shape I'm In\\", and  \\"W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\" all sound kind of the same, and even though they don't lag in emotional intensity, don't have a whole lot to say in terms of their lyrics.<br />\\"Daniel & the Sacred Harp\\" and \\"Stage Fright\\" get a better grade mainly because their lyrics have more of a story to tell, and they turn the phrases of those stories in very interesting/unusual ways. For years, \\"Daniel . . .\\" was my favorite of the bunch, mainly because the sense of mystery that engulfs it, the little allegorical gems that it metes out, the sinuous melody line, the gorgeous 3-part harmony at the chorus, and the little accordion ending which is oh so fine! At this point, I might think that the melody is a bit too happy sounding considering the subject/theme; but heck, look what Bob Dylan did on \\"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\". [Then again, Bob's delivery might have been a bit tongue-and-cheek on that one].<br />Speaking of such matters, there was a rumor going around early in '70 that the song \\"Stage Fright\\" was really about Mr. Dylan.<br />Moving on--there are some other truly fine songs: the emotionally upbeat [tinged with bits of irony] \\"Strawberry Wine\\" is a truly great opener, and is probably the closest in style to that of their previous album. \\"Sleeping\\" is, to put it plainly, an exquisitely romantic tune, played and sung with strong conviction and feeling. Even more beautiful and heartfelt is \\"All La Glory\\". The sequence of the original album closes with probably its strongest song, \\"The Rumor\\" [with its allusions to vigilante-ism], which closes with the words:<br />  \\"Close your eyes, hang down your head, until the fog rolls away . . . let it roll away!<br />  Open up your eyes . . . and feel the good . . . I think it's comin', a brand new day!\\"song, \\"The Rumor\\" [with its allusions to vigilante-ism], which closes with the words:<br />     \\"Close your eyes, hang down your head, until the fog rolls away . . . let it roll away!<BR>     Open up your eyes . . . and feel the good . . . I think it's comin', a brand new day!\\"
B0000636UN|4.0|&quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; makes the fourth studio cd from Sheryl Crow, and it's perfect. Too perfect. Perfect songwriting, perfect singing, perfect musicianship, perfect production. So perfect that I felt bored. While Sheryl's self titled cd from 1996 was edgy, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; feels calculated. Where &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; was experimental and diverse this cd felt too homogenous. There are gems on this cd to be sure. Who can resist the catchy hooks in songs like &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;, &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;, &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;? They're all memorable and hummable songs, and the ballads &quot;Safe and Sound&quot;, &quot;It's So Easy&quot; and &quot;Weather Channel&quot; are also very enjoyable, but &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; as a whole, felt lacking in inspiration. I understand Ms. Crow has turned 40 this year and seems to be taking stock of her life in some respects, but in taking stock she could have also taken some musical risks here but she chose not to. Again, this cd certainly is well done, but I don't think it is superior to her first two cds. It's just holding steady. There are a few songs that could have been cut to make this cd better like &quot;You're An Original&quot;, &quot;Over You&quot;, &quot;It's Only Love&quot; and &quot;Abilene&quot; all of which, I felt, slowed the cd down or were redundant. Sheryl Crow has also mastered the retro-seventies sound like Lenny Kraviz, but it would sure be interesting if she, and Mr. Kravitz, could come up with a sound that is more her own. It seems to be trendy since the 1990's to re-use and recyle old music instead of carving a new path. I consider Sheryl Crow to be sturdy like a Bryan Adams or Rod Stewart--always dependable but seldom taking risks.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|After 12 months spent touring between  U.S.A. and Europe, - and David Knopfler's departure -(who recorded  a \\"Solid Rock\\" version published on \\"Ridin' High\\" soundtrack), the remaining of Dire Straits gave birth to their 3rd records. <BR>Seven astonishing songs who revealed the true capacities of the group; not more J.J. Cale blues, a faded postcard forgotten on a Caribbean Island, neither dylanian musical inflexions, a keepsake that can't be able to represent the ambitions o f Mark&co., but the will of becoming a mainstream rock'n roll band was admired by everyone. The imaginativeness Mark Knopfler's creativity moves through the liquid and sparkling style of his guitar, making us discovering he  doesn't rest  on his own laurels. Songs like \\"Tunnel of love\\" (a greatest 80's lovestory), \\"Expresso love\\" (electric rock that blends love with coffee!), and \\"Solid Rock\\" (a pressing rock who tell you what rock'n roll in the 80's was), are the jewels that follow the high road led in the first two albums. The love ballads \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Hand in Hand\\" let grow up the level of gratification for this album and clearing up that Mark is (and going to be) one of the greatest songwriters of all the times (sorry mr. Lennon/Mc Cartney, Jagger/ Richards,etc....) that knows the magical key to make a charming and fascinating songs. <BR>The thrilling \\"Skateway\\": where the music becomes epic and the Knopfler's style rise to incredible expressive levels.<BR>A great deal of people glimpse a compromise between business reasons and condescendence for the lovestory, but what i see is an excellent final result, with a portentous biz impact.
B00005Y1UX|5.0|Now let's be realistic here. This film is kind of unbelievable but to tell you the truth, it is a film that is very original and classy. I remember when it first came out in the movies and the trailer and billboards were everywhere. With Sade's &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; playing in the background, this filmed looked like a future Oscar nominated film. The film was very intriguing to me despite the fact i was 12 years old back then when the film was released. I never got to see it at the movies but i did buy it on VHS when it came out on video. I was blown away by the script, plot and actors. The film must have been the best film I had ever seen (mind you, i was 12). Still today, i think it is still a very good film. It'll be classic to me and it'll be considered the most vicious film about money, love and power that was ever made. I recommend it to everyone who likes romantic films.
0446677450|4.0|RDPD, provides a good dose of financial reality to tyro investors. Kiyosaki's successful personal experiences help the reader understand the relevance of removing oneself from the \\"rat race\\" of working for money to spend, but to have money work for oneself. RDPD serves as a feel good book that makes any reader come to the conclusion that school is not life, and will not help financially. It is a good book for any high school student interested in beginning to develop a trained investor mind, however, do read it like a novel; if any part is boring skip over it and don't simply read over the life lessons and not actually think about them. Kiyosaki accurately depicts the hidden factors of the successful financial sphere.
B00004X0ER|4.0|... these guys can be HUGE in the States.  This is a powerhouse of a CD.  For one, it's less than half an hour long with 12 tracks.  Each song is a 2-3 minute dynamo with no filler.  As seen in everyone elses' reviews, these guys have a raw, punk sound.  The instrumentals sound very Sex Pistols at times, but they're still their own identity.  <br />People want to compare them to the White Stripes, BRMC, and the Strokes, but they're not really like any of them.  You'll have to just listen for yourself.  Each song just jumps out at you with their guitars, drums, and vocals.  This is pure, fast rock.  No ballads, no lengthy solos, no sampling, no acoustic song to mellow out the track list.<br />In this day, of pop punk/pop rock, take a listen to the Hives for a genuine rock/punk sound.  This CD comes with 3 music videos which provide a great look for the band.  If their record company provides the right PR, they can make a big splash and make a big impact which is very necessary in this stale American music scene.<br />Bonus note:  The price is kind of high for a CD that is less than 30 minutes long.  Do some searching and you'll find some good [low] prices.
B00000AFWW|1.0|Oh, man, how can someone say this piece of junk is \\"sonically amazing, masterpice and essential modern rock...\\"????<BR>I must remember you that this a prject developed by Courtney Love, an ambitious and talentless actress, a talentless \\"rocker\\", that only achieved some notoriety due to his relationship with the late Kurt Cobain.<BR>This CD goes reasonably well until the third track, when we have solid pop-rock. Then, it all comes down real quick...

B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is one of the few that every track hasa a different emotion and feeling yet all very similar. Every track is as good as the last to listen to.

B00005B6N7|5.0|The powerful cast and gripping story are perfectly balanced  with a force and buoyancy that left me exuberant even while watching a film about war. Jonathon Mostow magnificently volleyed the story and the power-packed performances of his cast, never leaving either with too much or too little weight.  <br />Mostow produced an intensely believable work of fiction based on actual events surrounding British and American captures of German Enigma code machines in WW 2.  <br />This drama spreads out the story and action over many key players and there's not a clinker among the cast.  Matthew McConaughey was absolutely commanding in his role, as was Bill Paxton.  Each man does his job so well that all of them hold up without abrasiveness or giving a sense of something being missing on repeat viewings. There is a humble, non-Hollywood attitude about this movie and the cast that captures more of the true spirit of the times than is often seen in present-day historical movies.  <br />I saw this first on VHS but I learned much more about the events in the movie when seeing the DVD bonus material.  See the DVD if you can!
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten is easily Pearl Jam's best album.  The mere suggestion that Vitology, No Code, or any of the other sucessive albums could even compare to Ten is ludicrous, plain and simple.  This is Pearl Jam's finest hour, when the songs were the most original, the most catchy, the most emotional.  Not to mention that producer Brendan O'Brien was at the peak of his recording skills; he has never matched the production quality found on this album with any of his other work.  Just compare the sound of this one to his production on albums such as STP's Tiny Music, you'll see what I mean.  Ten is more than a decade old, but the songs were so good and it was recorded so well that it still sounds 10 times better than most of the stuff on the radio right now.  The whole album is practically flawless, straight through, without any wasteful self-indulgent filler found on later albums like Vitalogy.  You won't have to put up with any annoying interludes like &quot;Bugs&quot; here, you're getting nothing but a straightforward rush of great songwriting.  Once, Evenflow, Alive, Black, Jeremy, Deep--heck, over half the album was a hit single on early 90's radio.<br />If you'll look at the song titles, there's an ocean/water theme going on here, probably borne out of Vedder's days as a San Diego surf dude.  Evenflow, Deep, Oceans, Release, see what I mean?  Black is probably my favorite song here, it sounds like absolutely nothing else that I've ever heard, but they're all good.  I read once that Release was actually recorded in just one take, simply amazing.  There's just so much energy in this album and even if, like me, you're often annoyed by Vedder's personality, you can't deny that he has an amazing voice.  The other members of Pearl Jam are clearly better songwriters, better musicians, but Vedder had a voice like no one else.  That is, at least until this album became a phenomenon and everyone started trying to sing exactly like him.  I think that what makes the songs on Ten so good is that Vedder was the outside man, new to the band, and Gossard and Ament were still in charge.  Its almost like Eddie is trying to prove himself here, he just has this incredible intensity in his singing.  Ten doesn't have even a hint of the laziness that you'll find in the lyrics/vocals of later Pearl Jam albums.  Anyhow, if for some reason you have never heard this album, go out and buy it right now, its flawless.  After hearing it you'll never look at Papa Roach and Nickleback the same way again.  I promise.
B000002E5J|5.0|I've been a fan of Shakira since she released this CD. She was so young and apparently so innocent, that we loved her lyrics and her so peculiar voice immediately. I can clearly remember walking down the streets of my hometown singing all of her songs during the San Marcos fair, that every single person looked at my friends and I wondering what it could possible be. Now that she's done her crossover so wonderfully, I highly recommend this album 'cause all the songs are wonderful. You will also super enjoy the UNPLUGGED.
B0000028UK|5.0|I have a lot of respect for this album.  Musically, Ten betters it by a notch, but I absolutely love the vibe they were going for here.  On this album Pearl Jam pulled back a little, going for a somewhat rawer sound, and trying to extend themselves in some new directions at the same time.  The first song Go, for example, is a really fast rush of energy, with almost a punk feel to it.  Daughter has a folksy feel, something you never would have expected from them until this point.  None of the songs on this album would have fit on Ten, and I give the band a lot of credit for trying out a somewhat rawer, thrashier sound.<br />One of the highlights is W.M.A., which is the modern equivalent of a George Harrison sitar song.  Lots of people don't care for it, because of course it isn't as catchy as your standard verse/chorus/verse, but I think its one of Pearl Jam's better moments.  It has this total tribal feel to it and makes you feel like you're in a trance.  They were really onto something with it, I would love to hear an album full of music in that vein.<br />Animal is probably the best song on the album, an angry alt-rock classic.  Glorified G is definately the catchiest tune here, the kind of track that'll just stick in your head all day long until you have to play it a million times in a row 'til you're sick of it.  Its also one of the few examples of humor in a Pearl Jam song, with lyrics that poke fun at gun-lovers and Christians.  Blood is the most agressive song I've ever heard from the band, with those really thrashy-sounding guitars that just sound more and more angry until the song reaches its end.  All in all, easily the second-best Pearl Jam album, bettered only by Ten.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This was cutting edge SCI FI in its time and surprising holds up rather well even today.  Though back then we thought of Leslie Nelson as a very serious dramatic actor.  Now after Police Squad and Mr. Magoo, it somehow takes on a slightly different light, making you wish they included the out-takes!!!<br />It is great to see this classic in such clean crisp form!  Based on Shakespear!!!<br />A must for every collector!!
B00005ATQD|1.0|...are cheap and easy ways to get a response from an audience.   <br />Did anyone stop to think about the fact that Kubrick chose TOM CRUISE (Risky Business?) and NICOLE KIDMAN, known more for their looks than for their acting ability, to play in his \\"intellectual\\" film about sexual intrigue?!?  Does anyone really DENY that they had hoped/expected some hot sex scenes between Cruise and Kidman, and that they were given that expectation by the trailers?  <br />If Kubrick had really wanted to emphasize the sexual psychology in this flick, he would have chosen lesser-known, non-heart throb actors for the roles.  To me, it is clear that Kubrick was pandering to his audience.  And it is precisely because he underestimated the intelligence of his audience that the film was unsuccessful.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This is the first movie I have ever viewed that was so truly horrible I felt the need to immediately write a review, warning others not to bother. A more complete waste of time and money would be hard to find.<br />As for the supposed excellent acting job by Osment, I have to ask: Am I really the only one to notice he has one squinchy little face he makes to show his emotions? How does that qualify as good acting? (Don't get me wrong - he's a cute enough kid, but so what?)<br />Steven Spielberg should have made up his mind what vision he wanted  - his or Kubrick's. He bounced from dark to perky &amp; back again without any apparent rhyme or reason. <br />Someone here also seems to have a very serious Oedipal complex. I don't know how else you can explain the First-Date-with-Mommy scene. <br />Finally, I don't see that there's really a big question here. We've had dolls on the market for years who could cry for their mommies. We've had talking fur balls.

0064407667|3.0|I read a lot of kids books.  And I mean a lot.  I usually love fanatasy books, but this one just wasn't up to par.  <BR>Unlike Harry Potter, or even the lesser known Silver on the Tree series by Susan Cooper, or Taran Wanderer by Lloyd Alexander, this book just felt empty.<BR>Although the black humour and magic will appeal to kids now, these books are a fad, and don't have enough substance to provoke much thought - or retain the interest of an adult.<BR>Although there is nothing particularily wrong with these books, for the money, there's nothing that spectacular in them either.
0783107986|4.0|I have watched these 26 episodes several times and the two bonus episodes are also a wonderfully informative and insightful addition, particularly the intensely expressive (albeit short) interview with Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary.  The voice and powerful acting talent of Laurence Olivier truly enhances the emotional impact of these series.  The facts are numerous, but, I gave these series only 4 out of 5 stars because, having read \\"A World At Arms\\", by Gerhard Weinberg (a 920-page epic account of the War), I found that some precious footage was wasted on showing too much of nothing (e.g. an entire episode was dedicated to Holland, hardly a major power in the war, even though it was a very fascinating episode indeed).  There were not enough details mentioned, for example about the Desert War in Africa, nor were enough episodes dedicated to the war in the Pacific.  There also should have been a much more in-depth coverage of major battles like The Battle of The Bulge, more expanded coverage of the final 9 months or so of the War in the Pacific where many things went wrong for Japan and why they went wrong.  There is hardly any mention of the weak coordination of the Japanese navy and army and their constant disagreements and quarrels which resulted in a practical \\"turkey shoot\\" for the Americans in the Pacific, of Japanese supply ships sailing with no convoy protection and Japan being forced to even use their submarines to transport food out of desperation.<br />There is also hardly any mention of Chiang-Kai-Shek of China and his dialogue with the allies in trying to stop enemies on two fronts - the communists of Mao-Tse-Tung and the Japanese barbars who delighted in cutting off the fingers and ears and hands and feet of Chinese civilians in places like Nanking (the Nanking massacre).<br /><br />But there are some excellent episodes like the one on Burma and that horrendous mud!... And everyone will remember Avadour-Sur-Glane (?), the French town where about 600 citizens, men, women and children were rounded up in 1944 when the Nazi's were in retreat after operation Overlord (Normandy) ... and shot...and the town was destroyed and stands in ruins, never re-built to this day as a dedication to the unspeakable monstrosities of the Nazis.  You will come out of these series never seeing humans the same way and thinking how animals are such \\"angels\\" compared to humans.  That old and mindless expression of calling someone an \\"animal\\" does not apply after you see this documentary, for animals never kill each other the way humans have done so many times in their history...<br />The quality of the footage is fine and the poetic voice of Laurence Olivier permeates ceaselessly throughout the series.  The episodes on the Soviet Union, with Russian songs and one particular poem is enough to make one's heart wrench (and teeth clench) and cry... Remember...<br />This is not an academic documentary series but still is the best one made so far on World War II.  You won't be disappointed by it.izens, men, women and children were rounded up in 1944 when the Nazi's were in retreat after operation Overlord (Normandy) ... and shot...and the town was destroyed and stands in ruins, never re-built to this day as a dedication to the unspeakable monstrosities of the Nazis.

B00000DR5D|4.0|This album sounds like a fusion of TD's sound on &quot;Phaedra&quot; and TD's sound on the &quot;Sorcerer&quot; soundtrack. On this one, the pieces are longer than &quot;Sorcerer&quot; pieces, but most of the time (especially the last 2/3 of part two) they have the same feel. On the other hand, like Phaedra's title track, they start with one musical idea and then let that build into other ideas over the course of the piece.<BR>This album features two instruments that TD rarely used in their early years and should have used more often: Drums (part 1) and Piano (part 2). At about 6.42 the drummer (I assume it's Christoph Franke) does a small drum solo. Imagine that - a drum solo in the middle of a 17-minute-long krautrock/electronica composition! Anything can happen in a TD live improv, I guess.<BR>The 2nd part begins with an acoustic piano doing a really cool, minor-sounding line, which is joined by flute. Very good! Near the end it's funny to think back on where the piece started. Come a long way from the start, eh?<BR>This is probably my second-favorite TD album (my first favorite being Phaedra). The sound quality is fabulous compared to some live albums by other people, and it's SO much better than my non-remastered copy of Phaedra. Just shows what a little digital spicing-up will do for an old analog album.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|Despite the enormous hype and promotion of Smith's &quot;transformation&quot; into Ali, I can only suppose that Mann -- who originally could not get the movie funded, especially after the tragically unsuccessful masterpiece The Insider-- was saddled with Smith as a condition of getting the money.  After all, in Hollywood, such a large budget could not be banked on anyone but Smith or Denzel, and Denzel can't play every single black hero, since he always looks just like, well, Denzel.  But Smith, without a doubt a likeable and charismatic actor, is all wrong for the part.  Despite the hype of voice training, he doesn't get Ali's voice or cadence right at all.  He's superb in the boxing scenes, and these are the best part of the film, but otherwise Smith's Ali lacks Ali's CHARM.  When Smith does Ali's famous playing with a child, &quot;Did I hurt you?&quot; (pretending to have punched him too fast to be seen), we don't feel like laughing with Ali's humanity, we feel like Smith just made a bad, self-serving joke.<br />For all of his poetic rants, Ali's gift (even in the ring) was his sphynx-like quality.  Even through his throaty braggadocio, one was always left wondering: &quot;Does he really understand boxing tactics, or is he just saying he does?  Does he really understand Malcolm X's complicated African nationalism, or is he just mimicking?&quot;  Mann's script is underrated, precisely because it preserves these questions instead of other treatments which take one side or the other.  But Smith walks through looking simultaneously cocky and bewildered, and that's not the same thing as the quiet and intense sphinx with the Mona Lisa smile, which was Ali.<br />At the same time, for all my admiration of Mann, one senses that he became too infatuated with historical accuracy for the mileau and boxing, and paid insufficient attention to the pacing (which is unweildy and inconsistent, so the audience yawns when they should be tense, poised for a climax) and to the supporting performances.  Peebles is an embarrassment as Malcolm X, for example.<br />Mann was in a Catch-22.  Ali is maybe the best biography of the twentieth-century, but there is no bankable Hollywood star appropriate for the role.  Given that reality, he should not have made the movie.  One senses Mann's integrity (shown in everything from Last of the Mohicans to Heat to The Insider) was somehow compromised here by his wishful thinking that he could make Smith into Ali so he could make the story.<br />The story is more engaging and thought-provoking in the dvd &quot;When They Were Kings.&quot;rting performances.

B00003CXXP|1.0|This is the first movie I have ever viewed that was so truly horrible I felt the need to immediately write a review, warning others not to bother. A more complete waste of time and money would be hard to find.<br />As for the supposed excellent acting job by Osment, I have to ask: Am I really the only one to notice he has one squinchy little face he makes to show his emotions? How does that qualify as good acting? (Don't get me wrong - he's a cute enough kid, but so what?)<br />Steven Spielberg should have made up his mind what vision he wanted  - his or Kubrick's. He bounced from dark to perky &amp; back again without any apparent rhyme or reason. <br />Someone here also seems to have a very serious Oedipal complex. I don't know how else you can explain the First-Date-with-Mommy scene. <br />Finally, I don't see that there's really a big question here. We've had dolls on the market for years who could cry for their mommies. We've had talking fur balls. We have computer programs that show a certain inate  &quot;intelligence&quot; We don't't think they are really like us do we?

B000063DS1|4.0|For starters, I'll say that the Band is my favorite group of players/singers of any type of music; if I had to give up all my music except for one artist, the choice of whom to keep would be easy.  This is an indispensable set, an unshakeable foundation for the serious lover of music that is emotionally honest and played with incomparable originality, versatility, and soul.  There's a quote in the booklet: \\"The Band didn't sound like a group of teenage millionaires.\\"  That sums it up.  The subject matter of their songs and their manner of putting it across took you inside a whole way of life, populated by people who paid their dues, took their chances, earned their wisdom and shared it with others.  Having said all those nice things, I want to throw in some details on why I can't give it five stars, at least this version of it.  I'd prefer the songs presented in their original sequence, which you can hear on the bootleg of the show.  There was drama in that structure, and you get something dramatic here too, but it's not the same--originally, the Band played their own set, then most of the guests followed, all but for Bob Dylan.  After an intermission with poetry reading by some members of the Beat Generation and a Hell's Angel, The Band came back for a few numbers, playing \\"The Weight\\" before Dylan's set.  Also, while it is true that MOST of the material from the original show is here, there still are a few things left out, such as Richard Manuel singing \\"Georgia on my Mind\\" and ragged versions of \\"Evangeline\\" and \\"The Last Waltz.\\"  Finally, even though I'm as impressed by the improved sound as anyone, it wouldn't have hurt to leave some of the rough edges intact.  The horn sections on \\"Shape I'm In\\" and \\"Don't Do It\\" were overdubbed after the fact: those are just two of the more obvious examples of post-production sweetening.  The true live version of \\"Don't Do It\\" is looser and longer, and, to my ears, much more moving.  By all means, purchase this set--but be aware that it is a version of the Last Waltz, not a complete or completely faithful document of it.
B00004SCX6|1.0|All Britney Spears is a young girl with no musical talent and doesn't even write her own music. Then why does her music sell? Because she has a great body and some clever businessman used her to make bubblegum pop sell. Her songs get to your head and annoy you and her voice isn't good for a singer. It's the voice of an average girl, but it's enhanced by computers to sound great. Britney's first CD was mediocre, but her CD's keep getting worse from there. I can't believe the top music these days is by bubblegum pop like Spears or N'Sync.
B000005HN6|1.0|I can't believe all the positive reviews for Opeth's music. It just reinforces my opinion that we live in such a world of mass produced sound-alike music that the moment something noticeably  different comes along, everyone pounces on it and anoints it a classic. Well, different ain't always better, as this album shows.<br />Whilst it is true that Opeth's music is characterised by many changes of tempo and style from hard metallic riffs to melodic rhythm, this is hardly new territory for metal. Iron Maiden did much the same thing, and much much better, just take a listen (for instance) to their album Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Opeth attempts these transitions without seeming to have a clear idea of the end result it wishes to create, making the album sound very uneven. In addition, the death metal growl is often totally misplaced on this album, clear vocals (like Nightwish) would have sounded a lot better. I'm not saying I dislike death metal vocals in general, quite the contrary, but they have to have to cohere with the context of the music. Such vocals are fine for Deicide or Sepultura's kind of music, but totally out of place in this sort of stuff.<br />The melodic parts are not so hot either, although they may be a total culture shock for the hardened death metal fan. Opeth's attempts at making \\"neo-classical\\" music are almost laughably infantile compared to some of the really beautiful classical music out there.<br />Overall, I found this CD (and Opeth's music in general) to be meandering, pretentious crap.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an incredible album. I read about her in a magazine and went out to listen to her album and was blow away by her voice and musical arrangement. She sounds so much older than her 22 years, so much different than others in her age group are singing right now. This is my new favorite Sunday afternoon/rainy day cd. This is a must have!!!!!
B000002NHN|5.0|I love this CD! Loreena's voice is incredible; she sings like an angel. And the music is beautiful, too. Each song is about her journey through different lands, and the music is representative of each land - there is a mixture of Arabic, Middle Eastern, Turkish, and Irish which is just a joy to listen to. I can listen to this CD while driving, working, or relaxing. I played this CD at a party at my house and all my guests loved it and asked about it. Loreena McKennitt is truly talented and this CD proves it. It is just amazing. A must have!
B00005S770|4.0|This has to be the best album Rainbow has ever done,I first bought the album in 1980 and i must have listened to the album more than a thousand times by now,(this is the 5th time i have bought the album due to wear &amp; tear)If you are truly a Rainbow fan this album is a must to any record collection Deep Purple have (smoke on the water) as there anthem (Stargazer) is Rainbows
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK is not dumb.  He has talent.  He is AC/DC for our era- great songs, dumb statements, zero dynamics.  if you think that this is serious and therefore bad music, you have no sense of humor.  Andrew is as serious as you want him to be.  you can buy into the whole party hard rhetoric or just listen to the songs and rock out.  the production is cheesy and processed to the point of absurdity, but it just makes it better.  not to be elitist, but my usual taste is indie rock, circa 1994.  not when i need to party hard though.
B000063VTN|4.0|With 18, moby gives us again a verry nice couple of songs! 18 is new. The songs sounds new. But they are in the style of play. <BR>Different is that moby now is a well known, and populair, artist. I think we will hear a lot of singles from this album, not as with Play.<BR>I think this album will become a \\"must have album\\"
0452282152|4.0|From the begining this book blends art history and fiction.  The plot is easy to follow, but make no mistake, the writing is not simple. From the first page the reader is greeted with delightful sentances such as...&quot;I heard voices outside our front door-a woman's bright as polished brass, and a man's, low and dark like wood...&quot;<BR>  Also writers will enjoy the many beautiful and imaginitive similies the author included that made this book a joy to read.
B0000027RL|4.0|This is a great introduction to Pearl Jam because nearly all the songs are catchy and interesting.  And you'll be surprised by how many songs you reckognize on the first playthrough.
0312958455|5.0|Whilst i dont feel this is quite as good as his previous book, The Concrete Blonde, it is certainly quite close on it's heels. <br />Harry Bosch is getting a stronger character book by book, and his world even more gritty and realistic. <br />The plot isnt as good as that of The Concrete Blonde, but Connelly's writing has developed nicely...<br />This is a great great series, and this is sure to be one of the best entries.
B000002UJQ|5.0|serendipity aside...<br />Warning: You're going to want to burn this album, but you won't.<br />Ok computer by radiohead: is a masterpiece novelty album (the best I've heard in a long long time). It is, a Dali painting - get that straight. One night of bliss with Sheila, and you know Sheila ain't coming back. Thats why you will want to burn this album, but you won't. <br />I'm rolling on the floor, laughing my [rear] off cause now it's two of us.
B00000JFV9|5.0|It's hard to believe that my father bought this album 20 something years ago and I still love it. Curtis best tracks on this album are pusherman, freddie's dead, superfly, and little child runnin' wild. A collector's item.
B0000028UK|4.0|This CD has a bit more of a hard, testosterone edge on many of its songs, which is awesome.  Not quite as many hits came from this album as did from &quot;Ten&quot;, but in the long run it is every bit as good an album, perhaps even better.  Musicallity, anger, passion, beautiful.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Many times movies come along and they look like they're gonna disappoint, especially if it has a cast that appeals to the MTV and teenybopper crowd. It's annoying, especially geeks like me, to see a favorite hero being portrayed by your typical teen movie star. Well, i saw the movie and IT ROCKED. I threw away everything i said in the beginning of this review right away. I thought the cast was great. Everyone was good in it. Toby McGwire is Spider-Man, i thought he would SUCK, he doesn't, he's great as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. William Dafoe was over the top, but fun as The Green Goblin. I'm not getting into plot because it'll piss off the hardcore fans who DIDN'T get to see the movie yet. Sam Raimi did a TREMENDOUS job directing the movie. Visual effects were top notch, even though sometimes they look fake, but it gives it the comic book feel. This beats Superman as my all time fav comic book to movie adaptation...
B000002C4J|5.0|Immortality is my all time favorite Celine Dion song. The whole CD is good, however not her best, although, in my opinion, she's never done a bad CD! Rock on Celine!!
B00005M989|3.0|...instead of making a half-baked compilation when there was already a worthy one (The Hits 1/The Hits 2/The Hits, The B-Sides) - and in spite of the fact that Prince split from Warner Bros. acrimoniously - why doesn't Warner Bros. re-release all of his classic albums (digitally re-mastered, of course)? There is a ton of great music that is unjustly getting ignored.
0553106635|4.0|As many fantasy series trudge through the middle books they get bogged down with &quot;filler&quot; plots and random information. Luckily this book remains lively and full of surprising twists. One of the most enjoyable and unique elements is the humanity of the characters. No one is flawless or bound to some miraculous destiny. A nice change from the other fantasy series.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I have seen Koyaanisqatsi twice on the big screen.  It plays occasionally on PBS.  The most fantastic experience I ever had was in the mid 80's when there was a showing of the movie at Royce Hall, at UCLA in Los Angeles, California.  The soundtrack was performed live by a small orchestra and chorus, directed by Philip Glass.  I was glad I had already seen the film because I kept getting caught up with watching the performers and Mr. Glass.<br />Koyaanisqatsi is one of the most damning commentaries on the beauty of our Earth being destroyed by the whims of mankind.  The theme of \\"life out of balance\\" applies to almost every member of the human race.  We have/are destroying our environment with the filth that we spew into the ocean, the air, and the earth.  Our current government policies are sending us down the slippery slope of denial.  I cannot remove myself from the list of offenders as I live in suburbia with my toilet, garbage disposal, automobile and trashcan adding their measure of pollution that the Earth suffers from.  What is the answer?<br />Koyaanisqatsi asks the questions, but humanity needs to provide the answers.  The images are gorgeous, even the ones of destruction; the soundtrack is compelling.  If you haven't seen Koyaanisqatsi you will recognize it's influence on the media when you see the time-lapse photography, and skillful editing.  This is a movie that every caring environmentalist needs to see.  Please add your vote to requests that the DVD be released.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Unbelievable performance that is very rare to find these days - Stevie with his amazing talent plays with his idol as if he practiced for this meeting for his entire life, and he sounds quite amazing - doing improvisations that could easily to qualify as famous solos, getting some advice from Albert King - this is amazing. If you're into Stevie Ray and Albert King, or just starting with the blues then this CD is for you.
B00000613T|5.0|Overall this is a very good performed Mahler no.9<br />Highlight is def. the Andante comodo I find very moving, sensitive played, conducted so forget about Boulez as \\"cold\\".<br />Scherzo (Im tempo eines... etc.) is grim and fun as it should be and the very difficult Rondo-Burleske is extremly well played.<br />My only doubt is last movement (Adagio) but it is def. NOT bad at all. Maybe its lack a bit of contrasts here and there but that manner doesnt ruin this disc... not at all and string section do a wonderful piece of art (music) with it (even if I like RCO Amsterdam string section and sound better overall).<br />There is a lot of good Mahler no.9 out there but my advice is that you get this one as a first choise because of Boulez handle Mahler not as a \\"primal scream\\" therapy but as one of the greatest composers ever.<br />Anyway... you cant def. NOT go wrong with this one and sound is excellent.<br />Boulez has done a good Mahler AGAIN and Chicago do this better than I thought they could do and this is a pleasent surprise... or surprise... Boulez know (his?) Chicago so well and mayby thats it?
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie scared me to death! Mostly because there are people who actually live this way. I found it so realistic, I practically held my breath through the whole film. I loved it.
B000002BUY|5.0|I picked up this album after hearing a live version of \\"New Skin\\" on the Family Values Tour '99 CD. It has quickly become one of my favorite CDs in my collection. Every song on this album is flawless. So flawless, in fact, that I've come to learn every nuance of every instrument in each song and in every note vocalist Brandon Boyd sings. I can recite this album from memory, and there's not a lot of albums that I'd have the interest to do that for.<br /><br />Easily Incubus's crowning achievement, it sadly also marked a decline for their sound, which stayed decent in Make Yourself but was quickly lost in the next couple albums. This is the Incubus I want to remember.
B000001GOZ|5.0|Some people cant stand Boulez Mahler cycle and I dont understand why??? It is probably because they like Mahler as a kind of Esalen therapy but Mahler is more than huge emotions and as one of the worlds leading Mahler experts De La Grange point out... Mahler is NOT primalscream therapy... Mahler is about complex music and it IS sometimes very detailed and only Boulez, Chailly, Abbado and Salonen understands this (no harm over other conducturs but honestly... we KNOW MORE about Mahler in those days) <br />Well of course Mahler had his ups and downs, he was probably a very sensitive guy but he was also analytical, introspektive, intellectual and MODERN, DARING, moving FORWARD and in the same way had some &quot;conservative&quot; manner. His mix of late romantiscm and modernism is VERY special because of this and one of the best conductors ever showing us Mahlers special style is Pierre Boulez.<br />I think Boulez and Wiener Phil give us one of the best (THE BEST?) no.6 ever. I have never heard opening allegro so grim and at the same time sensitive as I do on this disc and rest of isnt bad either(in fact all movements are beutiful, fantastic). <br />Of course it is a matter of taste but I am very satisfied with this one and even people full of prejudice against Boulez complaining over: &quot;Boulez is cold and too analytical&quot; should give this disc a chance.<br />This disc is highly recommended by Mahler authoritans and so by me.
B00005JKJA|4.0|OK, here's a CliffsNotes explantion for the crybabies that didn't understand the movie:<br />1. The movie begins with a shot of someone falling asleep on a red pillow. This is Diane Selwyn. This leads to...<BR>2. The first half of the movie, which is Diane's dream. In her dream, she is Betty, a perky, aspiring actress with everything going for her (Betty is everything that Diane is not in real life). In the dream, the amnesiac Rita is based on the real Camilla Rhodes whom Diane had an affair with (likewise, Rita is everything that Camilla is not in real life). <BR>3. The second half of the movie is Diane awake. We learn that her life stinks in a series of flashbacks which also explain the dream she had the previous night. <br />All of the recent events and characters in Diane's real life (the cowboy, the Espresso guy, the waitress, Bob Brooker, Coco, the scared guy at Winkie's, etc.) show up in some form or another within the dream.  Look closely... you'll see them all. (Sidenote: I don't know if any of you have had a dream recently, but you probably dreamt about $hit that concerned you in real life too. Not to hard to understand that, right?) <br />For those of you that appreciated figuring out this movie (as I did), I applaud you. The only reason why I didn't give the DVD five stars, is because the chapter selection would have been truly useful (although seeing the movie as a whole is a the real experience).<br />Is Mulholland Drive a frustrating movie? It sure is. Is it hard to watch? It sure is. Is it worth watching? ABSOLUTELY! It's one of the few movies of last year that demanded that you use intelligence to unravel its rewards. <br />For those reviewers who still don't get it, never fear... I heard Carrot Top is making a direct-to-video release real soon.
1573225517|4.0|Nick Hornby's High Fidelity was a laugh not only for its humor but also for its accuracy in portraying that segement of the male population that is utterly neurotic and wrapped up in some silly facet of pop culture as if it was what really defined them. The book was funny and intelligent, through the protagonist Rob Hornby lets slip a few of the things every man does, but doesn't want to admit to.
B000000XB9|5.0|If you're like me, you HATE greatest hits collections.  Real music fans don't buy greatest hits CDs - give this album one star - case closed!<br />Not so fast!  Chronicle Volume 1 is a different animal.  Sure, it's a greatest hits collection of sorts, but these songs are so incredible it just doesn't matter.  In fact, as a teenager I had tapes of a couple of CCR albums and always found them to be a bit uneven - great songs mixed with not-so-great ones.  Chronicle Volume 1 solves that problem by offering you 20 songs so wonderful you'll want to share them with everyone you know.  <br />From the soft stuff (`Bad Moon Rising', `Lodi', `Who'll Stop the Rain') to the hard stuff (`Fortunate Son', `Travelin' Band', `Sweet Hitch-Hiker'), this music is pure Americana.  If you don't like it, maybe you should be living somewhere else.  <br />I apologize - that was a bit harsh and inappropriate - especially if you already do live somewhere else.  If this isn't your taste in music, I respect your opinion and won't hassle you anymore.  But chances are, if you buy this CD, your only regret will be that it doesn't include `Good Golly Miss Molly', `Molina', `Cotton Fields', and other CCR classics.  Guess that's what Chronicle Volume 2 is for!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Now it's true I never got into Twin Peaks when it was on TV but a bad movie is still a bad movie.  I've heard from friends who were familar with Twin Peaks that this Mullholland Dr had similar tones.  If that's true I'm glad I never watched Twin Peaks.<br />Hey I can deal with artsy-fartsy movies and the avant guard and even B movies, but there are 2 sins in movie making I can't forgive: the acting and the dialogue.  Both are terrible in this move.  After 2 scenes I looked at my wife and said, &quot;People just don't talk like this.  This is the type of dialogue a 5th grader writing his first story would churn out.&quot;  <br />The acting was equally horrible, unless of course these were great actors actually trying to come off like bad actors; in that case I scream 'Bravo'.  But that is highly unlikely.  I saw better acting in my 4th grader's Christmas pageant last year.  The little kid playing the stable manager was more believable.<br />If you're a big David Lynch fan buy this movie!!  If you have any doubts, and I mean ANY, wait until you've rented 10 movies at your video store and get the 11th movie free and then use it on this film.  That way you won't feel so bad when you rip this thing out of the DVD player.<br />Cheers.
B00003CX95|5.0|As a man of Celtic decent I have always had a passionate love for anything Scottish. Although my family Kilt is about the ugliest thing around I do keep as much to do with my heritage as possible around. And this movie is a part of that heritage, sort of. Well, not the movie itself, but the subject matter. Some of the battles took place in Sterling, and Sterling has a lot of history for my family, a dark and sinsiter history to be sure, and one that would make a great movie in and of itself. So because this movie was filmed on location my dad broke the traditional LDS ban on R-Rated movies when I was a kid (a ban that I do not place on myself now that I'm living on my own) to let us see this movie. According to our genology we had relatives that were actively involved with the epic battle this movie is based upon.<br /> The movie is perhaps one of the finest movies ever created, deep, passonate, and intense.. albiet fictionalized. (I doubt that William Wallace actually got the princess pregnate, and while I'm no expert I don't think they even actually met. The story revolves around the Brittish opression of the Scottish people, and one mans very personal battle to rid Scottland of Brittish influence forever. The acting in this film as superb, and the cinematography is sweeping. The battles are realistically bloody and give one a realistic glips into the horrors of midevel warfare, and the reason that fedual systems of government are a bad idea. But the real reason to buy this movie is how deeply passionate the movie really is. The filmmakers really cared about this story, and put thier hearts and souls into it and it shows. If more movies had this kind of love put into the projects, if cinematographers would love the projects as much as these guys did, the cinematography, acting, score, and attention to detail, then Holywood would not be swimming in the sea of franchise cash cows and mediocrity that it is swimming in now. This movie defines epic and Rated R or not, should be seen by people of all ages. This is a part of history, and a story that everyone should know.hould be seen by people of all ages. This is a part of history, and a story that everyone should know.
6300247376|3.0|The 1981 film \\"Death Hunt\\" is a motion picture screaming for an audience. It has all the earmarks of a memorable action/adventure. But the final result falls short due to the lack of an accomplished director (who is Peter Hunt?) and cluttered second half.<br />\\"Death Hunt\\" is a great action flick, make no doubt. It's oddly enjoyable seeing old veterans such as Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin - both in the twilight of their unique careers - chewing up the lush Canadian scenery while involved in a battle of wills during a early 20th century man hunt. But it's the build up to the eventual chase, based on a true story, most viewers will remember from this sadly neglected film.<br />Mr. Bronson plays a man weary of society and war who returns to the mountains to get away from the bustle. Along the way, he rudely breaks up a man-made dogfight, saving a wounded shepherd from certain death. Such a rude interruption creates resentment, and several of the dog's former owners hike up to Charles' cabin to take the hound back. Bullets soon fly and a combatant ends up dead. Lee Marvin, as the local Canadian Mountie, is then drawn into the conflict.<br />A surprise is in store for the angry posse as they discover that trying to corner Mr. Bronson is akin to trapping a wild beast. By the conclusion of \\"Death Hunt,\\" many in the cast of supporting veterans (Andrew Stevens, Carl Weathers, Ed Lauter, Angie Dickinson) will end up stiffer than a frozen tree.<br />I will not give away the build up, suffice to say that the action is crisp, fiery and pumped. And the villains of this film, a sad bunch barely a notch above the fighting dogs they force into battle, are reminiscent of many of the colorful miscreants of early Sam Peckinpah films (\\"Ride the High Country,\\" \\"The Wild Bunch\\"). In fact, Peckinpah would have been the perfect director for this opus, though if memory serves he was working on the European \\"Cross of Iron\\" at the time. With Mr. Peckinpah at the helm, \\"Death Hunt\\" could haveachieved lofty heights.<br />Instead, we are treated to a choppy second half of poor editing, confusing continuity, fabricated character motivation (Marvin constantly smiling through his binoculars at a retreating Bronson) and scenes of an attacking airplane which go on forever.<br />What viewers will remember most about \\"Death Hunt,\\" besides the already-mentioned opening half, is the near-brilliant performance of Lee Marvin as a burned-out Mountie. His presence is the gritty highlight of this energetic film, and one realizes his persona was one of the most admirably cyncial in motion picture history.<br />\\"Death Hunt\\" is a great discovery for those not yet acquainted with its rustic appeal. It is truthfully one of the last quality films of both Marvin's and Bronson's careers, thus it's the end of two commendable eras. That must be worth the price of someone's hard-earned ticket.
B00005ATZT|3.0|This movie is based off of some 60's TV show of the same name (I've never seen this show, so I can't compare the two), which in turn, I've heard, is based off of a true story. Harrison Ford as Richard Kimble is perfect for the role, he's an action movie star who brings emotional conflict into his movies. You can always tell when he's angry. Tommy Lee Jones as U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerrard is also a perfect match. He's got a nice sense of humor when he's ordering his men around. They say that Richard is fish food after jumping off of the dam, Sam tells them to find the fish that ate him. He's obsessed and will stop at nothing to find Richard.<br />Richard Kimble was a happily married cardiovascular surgeon, but then one day he comes home to find his wife dying. He has a fight with the killer, a one armed man. The police don't belive him, so he's then convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to death. On the way to the prison, his bus crashes and he escapes along with some other prisoner. He's now on the run trying to find his wife's killer. Samuel Gerrard is also looking for him, and will stop at nothing to find him. Before he was sentenced, Richard was investigating a new \\"wonder drug\\" that causes liver damage, but someone was replacing the bad liver samples with good samples so the drug could be approved. He then figures out that the one armed hitman was after him, but he had a last minute operation, so the hitman killed his wife instead. He figures all of this out while avoiding Sam, and nearly gets caught again several times, once he had to jump off of a dam. <br />This film is one of the best movies, ever. I've watched it countless times and I'm not bored of it yet. If you want a good movie experience and a laugh or two, go pick this movie out.
B00005N9CV|5.0|A tremendously enjoyable cd, to be savoured and listened to repeatedly with someone you love. The extremely sexy Diana may well be the best artist to have emerged from North America in many years.
B00000K0DT|4.0|It is hard to believe that the time it took to write this movie took only slightly longer than the running time of the finished project. Never in my life have I been so caught up in a suspense-laden drama-action movie and been caught so off guard by the ending.<br />Five (in)famous criminals take on the big heist that will enable them to retire. How did they get thrown together? For whom are they working, really? Whom do they trust? And what about this Keyser Soze? Is he real? Who is he, and what does he have to do with any of this?<br />This movie was a brilliant marriage between spectacular acting and phenomenal writing. This movie is so worth your time, it's worth purchasing for your home collection. I have seen it many times and find something new in it each time I see it. Although Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal, Gabriel Bryne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin and Chazz Palminteri all turn in exceptional performances to make this film a can't-miss. <br />Be sure to watch this movie when you won't be interrupted. Turn off the ringer on your phone, make sure the kids are asleep, turn off the lights, and prepare yourself...
1587990717|5.0|No question, the author is deeply eccentric, and wants us to know it.  (He claims to &quot;glorify personal idiosyncrasies to avoid bearing any intellectual resemblance to the crowd.&quot;)  And his claim to model &quot;the Victorian gentleman scholar&quot; who will &quot;avoid the media, television, newspapers&quot; in favor of hanging out in salons with intellectuals (shunning other stock traders, whom he views with contempt) so he can read poetry and &quot;remain steeped in Greco-Roman culture&quot; can be downright annoying.  But don't be put off.  By the end you will not only learn to like the author, but he will illustrate in an easy, entertaining style our genetic predisposition to see patterns and causality where they do not exist.
B00005B36H|1.0|After Aenima ( the only one of Tool's albums that actually deserves stars), Tool made it a priority not to make another fantastic album, but rather to \\"top Aenima.\\" As a result, this album sounds very forced.  I'm writing a negative review for this trash because few others will do it, and this album certainly does not deserve four and a half stars. <br />...<br />Another problem with this album is that the songs are too long. Long songs can be nice if they can hold your attention; one of my favorite songs is over 65 minutes long. But Tool's just drone on and on forever.  On Lateralus, songs that should have taken two minutes end up taking ten. <br />It's obvious that nobody actually listens to Lateralus, even those that claim they do. This album is so bad that it cannot be appreciated on any level, either for musical complexity, originality or just plain catchiness.Everyone buys this album because it's \\"cool\\", and then it sits on their shelf and collects dust while they tell everyone what a brilliant and innovative album it is. Save your money.
0380018179|4.0|This was a fascinating look at the result of sacrificing your life for religion. For those of us who believe that living a flourishing life here on earth is not only possible, but profoundly moral - this book reconfirms that sacrifice (giving up a greater value for something of lesser or no value) brings guilt, pain, sadness and an overall sense of loss. Beautifully written, this book follows the lives of people consumed with guilt, remorse and hopelessness. From that, they become strong, but happiness eludes them. Many times during my reading of this book I wanted to shout to the characters \\"I'm happy! You can also be happy! Stop sacrificing, evading and living for false values! Stop hurting yourself and those around you!\\"<br />This book beautifully shows the destruction of lives caused by religion and sacrifice.
B00005V9L1|4.0|this movie is mind-boggling, excellent watch and an incredible cast.....very worthy......
B00005ATQF|1.0|Good movie, bad studio.<BR>What the thought process behind having this DVD only include the pan scan version is what I keep asking myself.<BR>Don't let the Stanley Kubrick Collection labeling fool you; or you might very well end up having to buy this movie AGAIN just to see it in widescreen.
B00005YW4H|3.0|It's an enjoyable CD, but hardly worth the gushing I read here.<br />Just about every track comes in at three minutes or less (shorter than most sugary pop songs) and while that's not a bad thing, it does dice the listening into very small (California cuisine) tid bits.<br />Her sound is cool and smooth; her vocal range is no where near broad (not too many key changes here); her interpetations are fine. Why everyone is getting silly-fan-atical over her cover of the Hank Williman's song escapes me. Perhaps it the novelty of the choice more so than the performance. Personally, I think it's one of the weaker tracks; Track one is the keeper.<br />Pardon the self-righteousness, but I suspect the CD cover is generating as much buzz as the tunes contained within. If she looked like Mamma Cass, I don't think we'd hearing as much about her.<br />Bottom line: A good CD when you're in the mood for slower, mellow tunes with very little deviation in style or pace.<br />Cheers!
0679731725|4.0|The Remains of the Day<BR>By Kazuo Ishiguro<BR>Faber and Faber, 1989.<BR>\\"It seems increasingly likely that I really will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days.\\" <BR>Thus, Kazuo Ishiguro begins Mr Stevens' six-day journey to Cornwall in 1956 to reclaim the services of Miss Kenton, lost to both his employer and himself some twenty years before. Set in the 1930s at Darlington Hall, a secluded mansion in the romantic, English countryside, The Remains of the Day is a delicate story told by a masterful storyteller of the friendship between Mr Stevens and Miss Kenton, the butler and the housekeeper, and the love that grows between them and lasts for the rest of their lives. <BR>Set against the backdrop of the quiet beauty and elegance of the fading world of English aristocracy, The Remains of the Day won the Booker Prize in 1989. It highlights Ishiguro's gift for poignant character studies of masculinity that continues with Mr Ryder in The Unconsoled (1995). <BR>Mr Stevens is the perfect, English butler, studious and analytical, sensitive and diplomatic, with all the refined elegance of a gentleman's gentleman. But Mr Stevens is also the flawed man of Shakespearian tragedy. Since the most important thing in his life is always the practice of his profession, he is oblivious to the world around him. He entertains no opinion about the covert dinners at Darlington Hall with Germans and other heads of Europe in the lead up to WWII and is ignorant of his own repressed love for Miss Kenton. Mr Stevens' identity is subsumed by his role as butler. <BR>During the course of his six-day journey, Stevens takes us into his confidence as he investigates, at some length, the precise definition of \\"dignity\\" and further regales the reader with an account of his efforts to perfect the newly required \\"art of bantering\\". He embarks upon an analysis of \\"what\\" makes a great butler: good accent, impeccable command of language, general knowledge of awide variety of topics including \\"newt-mating\\", and the ability to ensure there are \\"no discernable traces left\\" of any \\"recent occurrence\\", such as a tiger shot while \\"languishing beneath the dining table\\", by the time \\"dinner is served\\". Indeed, the unforseen event of his own father's death whilst both are on duty at an auspicious occasion at Darlington Hall is a particularly poignant case in point. <BR>The Remains of the Day is a book you will either savour like a long-deserved cup of English Breakfast or find infuriating and tedious from first drop to last. If the offer of six days on the road with Mr Stevens would send you rushing for your overcrowded appointment diary, then don't pick up The Remains of the Day, because The Remains of the Day is Mr Stevens. However, the reader who takes the time to slow to the rhythm of Stevens' thoughts, speech, and lifestyle will likely revisit the journey many times.<BR>As a love story, The Remains of the Day stands alone, embracing the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, without the Italian flavour of violent emotion, the setting of Wuthering Heights, with none of the brooding despair, and the intimate, masculine narration of Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, without the adolescent frankness. Told with grace and subtlety, Kazuo Ishiguro's simple, delicate story is, most of all, like a haiku poem. <BR>The book is written in first person narrative so the reader is privy to little more than Mr Stevens will himself admit. But understanding the narrator is the key to unlocking the forbidden romance. Kazuro describes their love by what he does not say, telling the story by withholding information in a way that articulates the repressed emotion of the butler and is reflected in the restrained quality of dialogue, which is truly the highlight of the book. We learn to read between the heavy, velvet drapes, behind the gleaming silver, and under the crisp, starched doilies to uncover a romance that is unspoken, not only to the reader but alsoto the love object and even the narrator himself. <BR>The dialogue arises in intimate moments shared in close, personal spaces like Mr Stevens's private pantry and the cosy warmth of Miss Kenton's parlour. Under the guise of \\"professional communication\\", they playfully tease and tantalise each other and the reader, are tentative and hesitant in their inquiry of each other's motives, and sometimes suffer hurt and withdrawal. <BR>However, The Remains of the Day transgresses romance conventions in significant ways: the hero and heroine are not young and beautiful, the story is told by the male character, and the lovers do not openly speak their love, but, if romance is \\"about the sizzle and not the steak\\", then this is a story of singularly restrained passion and truly enduring love. <BR>The Remains of the Day will not be rushed and neither will Mr Stevens. I maintain every hope that one day Mr Stevens will find himself in the happy position in which he is able, at last, to declare his honourable intentions and offer Miss Kenton, with much preamble, a long-awaited proposal of the arrangement commonly known in the romance genre as marriage, though at such time as this may occur, children, of course, will be entirely out of the question.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Unfortunately, this film was predestined to alienate two groups of theater-goers:  first, hard core Kubrick fans who expected his more dispassionate and harsh view to be represented; and second, those who thought it would be another cutesy Spielberg production that they could take their 10 year olds to, ala E.T.<br />This is an adult movie with adult themes, and Kubrick fans (I count myself in that number) need to remember that Stanley desperately wanted this story told, and realized that Spielberg was the director up to the task.<br />What this movie attempts is a close look at who we are as human beings- what drives us, how we respond to intimacy and love, the extent to which we are driven by our fears, the disposable nature of our relationships, how love can bring incredible happiness and almost unbearable pain.  These are not trivial subjects, nor ones that are necessarily comfortable to examine.  The film succeeds in this exploration primarily due to the flawless, gut-wrenchingly emotional performances of Haley Joel Osment as the mechanical child and Frances O'Connor as his adoptive mother.  The scenes in which these two fine actors appear are riveting.<br />The middle section of the movie has David cast off into the unprotected \\"real\\" world where mechs are both loved (at least physically) and despised.  It is through this violent and inhuman world he must find his way back home, and he ostensibly emulates his quest based on the Pinocchio story he heard his mother read to him-he believes must become \\"a real boy\\" in order to reunite with his mother.  While much of this part of the film works well (the Flesh Fair, where robots are destroyed to the howling enjoyment of the crowd is very well done), it is here that the film takes a brief, and unfortunate, turn to the Wizard of Oz for its thematic elements.  Don't get me wrong- I love the Wizard of Oz.  But the parallels are so vivid that I half expected to see a signpost in the woods saying, \\"I'd turn back if I were you.\\"  The trip into Rouge City (Oz), with Gigolo Joe (the nimble scarecrow), to see Dr. Know (the Wizard), is the movie's weakest point.  Rouge City feels too cramped (it was created on a sound stage), and is too glitzy to be believable as a red light district.  One has the feeling that Kubrick would have played it much grittier, more down and dirty with this location.<br />That said, the film rights itself almost immediately, and the remainder of the film has beautiful, haunting images, and a very touching conclusion, as a long lost David is finally found by the only remaining inhabitants of the planet- artificial life forms like himself.  The honesty and respect the cyborgs show toward David is moving, in much the same way the cyborg Data (from Star Trek, TNG) was often used to portray the ideals of human nature more purely than his human counterparts could achieve.<br />The film itself is visually stunning, as one would expect from a Spielberg production.  The set designs and art direction are impeccable (especially the family home which is future oriented but still comfortable and warm, and the partially submerged New York in the later part of the film is beautifully recreated by ILM); the music by John Williams adds emotional depth without being intrusive; and the robot characters are vividly and seamlessly realized.<br />I recommend this film for its visual impact, its willingness to tackle interesting adult themes, and its outstanding performances.

B00005YXZH|5.0|There is nothing more predictable than music fans. Only Harry Knowles and his legions of basement dwellers can rival the &quot;online music critic&quot;. The buzz behind this album had been building for over a year, and the back story was all the more intriguing; band gives album to label, label says it won't fly, band buys it back and releases it anyway. What's not to love? Of course now that it is out and doing well, you get Phase 2, which is where the online community attempts to smash it because A) the earlier stuff was better B) it's not what we were hoping for or C) my kid brother likes it, which means I have to hate it. Move past all of that. Listen to the actual album. Now listen to it again. If you want beats that you can pound in your Honda Civic, move on. If you want everything in a nice neat package, with every song following a fixed format, follow the Honda guy out the door. This is music to be enjoyed if only for the sake that it is proof that people still make music for music's sake. Listen to &quot;Jesus, etc&quot; for the intro alone. I flashed back to CSNY for just a second. Listen to &quot;I'm the Man Who Loves You&quot; and I challenge you to not be humming it in the line at the ATM three weeks later. Give it an honest chance and you'll get more out of it than any ten albums you buy this year.
0385503954|5.0|Like The Blind Assassin, Atonement is a story within a story.  It is very well written and gets even more interesting after the first twenty-five or so pages.  I don't want to give away the story; suffice it to say that the author is effective in communicating the way one's life (or peoples' lives) can be very normal one minute and an incident can change everything from that moment onward.  <br />I belong to a few book clubs, and this would be a good choice for that type of a group and also for any individual who wants to read a good story written by someone who really knows what he is doing.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.
1573225517|4.0|This book is truly a classic.  There are a variety of underlying themes that a reader can openly see.  What makes this book so good is that most everyone that reads this novel is somehow able to relate at least one of the themes to themselves or someone they know.  The book illustrates how anything that an individual is attached to because the sole focus of ones life.  This can allude to many relational, work, and self-realization problems.  Rob in the story portrays a universal personality allowing everyone to read it to enjoy and be able to rationalize with this man and his complicated lifestyle.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Never has a movie so polarized the cinema-going world as \\"Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\\" If you've seen the movie, you fall into one of two camps, generally speaking:<br />* Fanboi: Overused terminology, to be sure, but you know what's going on here. Has seen the first trilogy seventeen times. Laughs at \\"Expanded Universe\\" aficianados. Bought the \\"Hardware Wars\\" special edition for the special effects upgrade. Considers Episode I an abomination of all things bright and wonderful, especially Lucas' Unholy Trinity of Jar Jar, young Anakin, and the entire Gungan race.<br />* Kids: Don't know what everyone's all upset about. Decent movie, but no \\"Empire\\", that's for sure. Was that Jar Jar fellow supposed to appeal to us, by the way?<br />The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it seemed to go out of its way to insult the intelligence of its target audience, by which I mean children age 6-16. I don't like getting hit over the head with comic relief any more than kids do, and Jar Jar was just too much for anyone. But enough about the albatross.<br />From a more sober perspective, this movie has little else to be ashamed of. It's technically accomplished, sporadically riveting, and has a couple of truly great set-pieces (the podrace and the Darth Maul battle scenes). The really interesting buzz being generated by the upcoming Episode II is that it forces you to re-evaluate your stance on Episode I. That's high praise indeed, but I'll believe that once I've seen it.

0780627024|5.0|well, so many things to say about this one...<BR>so let's get the technical brilliance over with: yes, the use of black&white versus colour is nothing short of marvellous. i can't think of a more effective use of special effects. forget outer space romps with unheard of creatures, forget the boombastic rollercoaster rides through neverneverland and what not. the simple touch of a little bit of red here and some blue there affected me more than the creation of whole species.<BR>the acting: flawless. i've never seen jeff daniels better than this, reese witherspoon is a hoot, and tobey maguire carries the movie along superbly. his scenes with joan allen are subtle yet immensely effective and touching. allen's performance is one of those rare moments of divine acting and nothing less.<BR>the plot is very entertaining and funny. but there is more to it. this is not only the story of pleasantville coming alive with passion and ultimately colour. it is also the story of how conservative turning dictatorial so-called values will try to stop changes as potential threats. watch out for (unfortunately not only past) historical references, such as a little \\"no coloureds allowed\\" sign in a shopwindow, or the burning of books by a raging mob. <BR>this movie is more than pleasant, it is a masterpiece.

He soon finds himself entangled in a web of strange rituals which seem to be the exordium of some horrible, unimaginable deed. Unable to decode the hidden meanings of the rituals of a cult that is foreign and, indeed, hostile to him, he continues his search in the hope that he will find the missing girl. His perseverance ultimately affords him an answer to all his (and our) questions; but there is a price to pay.<BR> More than a feast of gore this film is a fascinating examination of the clash of two systems of beliefs. The policeman is the bringer of law and order (enforcing indirectly Christian priorities and values). The island community has opted instead for a pagan lifestyle reflecting the beauty and brutality of Nature. Eventually both sides appeal rigidly to their respective gods for mercy (the island community for a good crop, the policeman for help). Both sides gesticulate emptily, in a Universe that doesn't care, the hidden meanings of their words and acts only understood to those who share similar beliefs. The gods remain silent and mercy is not to be found.<BR> A beautiful film, somewhat permeated by hippy ideals (but even that being to its advantage), with a climax that leaves you gasping for breath. Performances are uniformly excellent but Edward Woodward deserves special mention for his riveting performance as the puritan, austere but well-meaning policeman.

0596000480|4.0|Its a good book. The information and is all there, and the author gives thorough coverage on the topics. The reference this book provides is excellent. The only drawback is the book has no tutorials and i have to get them webmonkey.com. I would give 5 stars if the book has slightly more examples, pictures(print screen's) and if the book has slightly thicker paper.
6305069611|5.0|Brilliant Science Fiction Flick revolving around the Struggles of a Being trying to better his world. Of course we discover that under it all, he's not much different than the average Earthling! <br />Great &quot;thinking&quot; film.<BR>Highly recommend this flick!
B00003CY5K|4.0|Suppose you are a girl having \\"too blonde\\" hair for your boyfriend who ditched you and went to a law school.  Suppose you chase him, giving the best you can do, meaning, going to the same school to be a law student.  But how much does it take for you when you're to read heavy textbooks your nasty teachers assign to read instead of \\"Seventeen\\" or \\"Cosmopolitan,\\" to get back your ex-boyfriend?  Or your dignity for that matter?<br />Looking this way at \\"Legally Blonde,\\" truly enjoyable comedy, it becomes now 100 % clear that this joyful film is not a second cousin of \\"Clueless,\\" a modern high school comedy.  \\"Legally Blode\\" means exactly delectable Reese Witherspoon, and even if the script sometimes (or you might say always) gives a ridiculously incredible turns in any given 10 minutes, it is absolutely OK as long as Reese is on the screen ... and, thank Heavens, she IS!  <br />So, don't complain anything about less exposure of supporting players (Luke Wilson fans especially), and grab a huge cup of popcorn and just have fun.  Not every scenes are successful, I know, but as far as Reese's character Elle Woods is concerned, it is absolutely a genuine fun that make us forget any clumsy  moment of the story.  And for older film fans like me, you got a special appearance (welcome but too brief) of Raquel Welch.             <br />Finally, the film is reportedly made with a low budget ($ 18 millions), but every effort is put into the film's unexpect places where you might miss.  To illustrate, just try to count  40 different hairstyles that decorates Elle's head.  And watch out the delightful semi-musical scene in the beauty salon, where Elle teaches how to catch guy's attention (with incredible 98 % success rate).  This scene is choreographed by no other than Toni Basil.  Enjoy it.<br />Trivia: a little geeky student David who is given a suprising present form Elle is Oz Perkins, son of Anthony.
0452282152|2.0|How on earth did this book become a bestseller?  Flat, one-dimensional characters, no plot, strained metaphors . . . Griet doesn't have any redeeming qualities.  She's unkind to her family, snotty with a working-class man because his hands are dirty, and in love with a man who treats her like dirt, willing to jam an earring into an infected ear so the painting will be &quot;right.&quot;  We're supposed to root for these two?  The whole thing was disappointing and the ending cliche.
B000002VCQ|4.0|This album is simply marvelous.  It is the one time in her career when Whitney Houston sounded distinctive without sounding diva-esque.  Her voice is sweet, her tone is strong, yet it is basically without the histrionics she succumbed to after this album.  From the honeyed opening track of &quot;You Give Good Love&quot; to the rich blend of chocolate of &quot;Hold Me&quot;, this confection is both delectable and nourishing.  The only track that keeps it from gaining five stars is the leading contender for all time worst song:  &quot;The Greatest Love Of All&quot;.  This song is below the talent of anyone who has ever attempted it.  Fortunately, all of the other tracks on this album cover for it in such a way that one can suffer through the song, if only to get to the next one.  A must have for 80's R&amp;B devotees
B00002SSKI|5.0|I first saw this movie with my daughter, who borrowed it from a friend.  We loved it!  The characters are great; all different, yet bonded together in their own ways.  The time period is also reminiscent of my own childhood, and the soundtrack is excellent.  This movie reminded me of The Sandlot, another great 60's friendship story (with boys, however)...all of the actors, young and older, put in fine performances.  The more we watch it, the more we grow attached to it.  We own it on video and DVD and wish there were more movies like it!
B00004HYC1|5.0|This is a Japanese import on Toshiba-EMI.  I have the German import on EMI Electrola in U.S. packaging (common practise before U.S. plants made CDs before 1988).  Japanese imports usually have more to offer, so people there don't do vice-versa.  It should have the rare Arcadia track &quot;Say the Word&quot; and B-side &quot;We Need You&quot; as bonus tracks, which I have on a soundtrack tape and 45 respectively.
0714834491|5.0|Not quite.  But a 1000+ page brain dump from a graphic designer.<br />Browsing through the bookstore in NYC's Grand Central Station the other day, this book caught my eye.  Every page I looked at had something of interest.  <br />Broken into about 70 sections, the book covers a myriad of topics, some related to graphics, some to art, some to life, some to other things.  This book is impossible to classify, except to say that there's something engaging on every page and each page leaves you with a slightly different outlook.  This can be a great tool to jumpstart creativity, change perspective, alter rigid in-the-box thinking.<br />I'm not an artist or graphic designer, and don't know who Fletcher is (aside from the information in the book).  However, he seems to have been around the corner a few times, and this is a what he found there.
B00005JKCF|4.0|After seeing the Spiderman motion picture for the first time (certainly not the last) I must say that I am impressed.  The casting of this film was perfect and offered a refreshing spin on the characters of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson especially.  The movie truly shines in its adaption of the origin story, capturing aspects of the tale that I honestly thought had no hope of getting screen time.  I was amazed at the way the origin story was pulled off and how it was added to.  <br />The character alteration of MJ was actually a mix of Peter Parker's girlfriends throughout the series.  The resulting character is excellent and we end up caring for MJ and her conflicts.  Thus it may be said that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were brilliant in this film.<br />The one disappointing aspect of this film was the character of the Green Goblin.  Dafoe is not to blame for this flaw though.  As you may already have guessed, that rediculous looking costume and helmet did the character in.  Throughout the Goblin scenes I could not help but laugh at soem of the things that should have been dramatic.  If anything marred this film, it was the Goblin storyline and how poorly it was brought into the film.  It had potential, but that terrible costume and a rushed feel made the plotline a low point in the film.<br />But when the film is good, its great.  Highlighted by a great romance plot (the real plot in my opinion), and a bevy of amazing webslinging scenes, the movie is highly entertaining.  <br />So in conclusion:<br />THE DOWNSIDE:<BR>1.) the Green Goblin scenes  2.)A few tacky scenes that are meant to be dramatic, but end up looking rather ridiculous.  3.) Scenes with Uncle Ben kind of cause the mystery behind his character to dissolve...but it would not have worked without him (a little gray area, here) 4.) The ending seems rushed and is only slightly disappointing<br />THE UPSIDE:<BR>1.) Tobey Maguire in the best portrayal of Spiderman and especially Peter Parker I haveseen.  2.) Kirsten Dunst as a very likeable MJ  3.) A very well adapted Origin story  4.) great action scenes  5.) J. Jonah Jameson is hilarious.  6.) When the comedy is good, it is charming and entertaining.  7.) The final scene, although slightly rushed, leaves you anticipating the next film in the series.<br />All in all, this was a great movie and one that will draw a returned audience.  I know I'm planning to see it again tomorrow.  It may now be said that Spiderman is the film series to watch for.  As much as I love Batman, that particular series is awful.  Now Spidy should prepare to take his throne as king of superheroes.
B00004Y9PP|4.0|Not since James Cameron's Aliens has there been a suspenseful Sci Fi story as exciting as Pitch Black, directed by David N. Twohy (The Arrival). The story starts off where a team of space explorers crash land on an unknown planet, where they find out that before long the outlying planets will arrange in a row, unleashing an enormous swarm of vicious extraterrestrial creatures. Vin Diesel is Riddick; a prisoner on the spaceship, Cole Hauser as William J. Johns and Radha Mitchell is Carolyn Fry, the hard-hitting leader of the expedition to escape off the planet.<br />The action is impressive, the CGI is really cool, and Vin Diesel (The Fast and the Furious) is one of the most excellent anti- heroes ever! The film does have flaws, the narrative is often sketchy, and the story is predictable, but the action makes up for it with some of the best visual effects ever seen on film.<br />The DVD extras are as impressive as the film, with a commentary from the director, Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser, more commentaries from the director and visual effects supervisor, a 'making of' featurette and production notes.
B0000042MY|5.0|This is truely a work of art. The music not only fits in with the film with such perfection, but is a truely haunting and original piece. I did not realized what a hit this CD actually was until I came on this site and found all of these great reviews. Ever since seeing the film for the fist time I had been looking for the soundtrack. I found it and could not get over the beauty that was flowing through my ears. I can relax so well when this is in my CD player. It is one of those CDs with the feeling of romance,fear,joy,life and death to it. This is my all around favorite CD, and I will encourage anyone who is looking for something they could NEVER get sick of, to buy it and share it with others. But make sure you watch the haunting film that made this piece what it is now.

0385486804|4.0|Into the wild was a fantastic book.  I could not put it down.  You read page after page, experiencing new thoughts and ideas.  How could one young rich man leave it all to go into the wild?  Although the question may never be fully explained, you will have your own answer to that question. This book questions people.  It questions why we do things.  Why, when one man follows his dream, does everyone get so upset?  How can one man impact so many other people?  And there is no doubt that he did impact many people.  Christopher McCandless was a visionary.  Christopher McCandless was a noble ideologist.  The fact that in his pursuit of freedom and other values he died changes nothing.  He set out to do what few even attempt.  He followed his dreams.  McCandless dreamt about freedom.  About living without the restrictions that physical items give you. He dreamt about everyone being equal.  About no starvation or hunger.  He overcame obstacle after obstacle.  He never deterred from his initial dream about living n the Alaskan wilderness.  And he affected everyone's lives that crossed his path.  Some may of just thought how reckless he was, but at least he got them to think.  Many walk through their life never thinking for themselves.  Christopher McCandless did.  For that, he is a noble ideologist.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this film had to be a huge challenge for all.  The word \\"memento\\" means \\"remember\\" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.<br />The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.<br />I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.y to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.
B000003TA2|5.0|Far from the best or most interesting Sonic Youth album, but nonetheless a good dose of arty stoner alternative rock. &quot;Dirty Boots&quot; is no doubt a classic, &quot;Disappearer&quot; is some of that pretty rock like DAYDREAM NATION's &quot;Candle&quot;, &quot;Mote&quot; is probably the most lyrically complex out of the group along with Disappearer and has some of that good ol' distortion feedback at the end...<br />&quot;Kool Thing&quot; is decent, kind of ambiguous and sardonic, but definitely one of their weaker moments, an easily accessible MTV-friendly gem...&quot;My Friend Goo&quot; is simplistic and cheesy, mainly just good for laughs or amusement...&quot;Mildred Peirce&quot; has some nice screaming insanity at the end...&quot;Mary-Christ&quot; has a good arrangement of vocals...&quot;Tunic&quot; is a deep ride into the mind of a rock-minded individual who finnalt makes it but is never truly happy, narrated by Kim...&quot;Titanium Expose&quot; is probably the most known, appearing on the PUMP UP THE VOLUME soundtrack...&quot;Cinderella's Big Score&quot; is about incest I think...&quot;Scooter &amp; Jinx&quot; is a nice little fix of feedback...I think that's all the tracks.<br />good but don't expect DAYDREAM NATION...
B00005JKL8|5.0|Remember the news item a few years ago about an American Air Force pilot who was shot down over Bosnia and eventually rescued?  Well, this is NOT his story.  The only similarity is the concept.  That said, you can relax and enjoy this film for what it is - a wartime rescue thriller.<br />Starring Owen Wilson as Chris Burnett, a navy pilot in Bosnia and Gene Hackman as the seasoned Admiral Reigart who has to report to a French NATO commander, this film was directed by the young Tim Moore, known for directing SEGA commercials.  No wonder it has such intense and non-stop high energy.<br />Gene Hackman's performance shines as he is constantly torn between doing what he thinks is right and following orders and adds a very human dimension to the film - so much so that it actually brought tears to my eyes.  I also was kept at the edge of my seat by the constant tension as the pilot first watches his partner being executed and then is the object of a chase by what looks like the entire Serbian army.  The technical effects are outstanding and I felt the pilot's fear, panic and quick decisions as he dodges a wide variety of explosive devices and bullets.  Of course it's preposterous.  But the film moves so quickly and things happen so fast that I had no time to ponder the actual reality of what was going on.  Instead, I was drawn right into the film and felt I was right by his side as he ran for his life.<br />Yes, the outcome is predictable.  And the ending, which will leave people thinking this was a true story, is deceptive.  Forget about historical accuracy.  And forget about reality.  Just think of this of an escape film with a large enough budget to make the experience an exaggerated version of real life.
B000000HTO|2.0|I purchased this album without having ever heard a note of VDGG, but figured that, on the strength of a strong customer rating, and the glowing reviews of VDGG as a band, this disc was a safe bet.  I found the disc to be thoroughly disappointing.  Vocalist Hamill's efforts to stretch the limits of his vocal range for the sake of emotional/dramatic expression are admirable, but the results are not.  Hamill's vocals are certainly brimming with emotion, but I prefer vocal performances that are both emotional AND technically proficient.  No matter where you live, somebody down the street from you sings better than this guy.  The music itself lacks bite - the solos are cliched, the bottom end is lacking, and the few moments of electricity sound contrived rather than inspired.  Passion and melodrama are oft and easily confused, and this album is case in point. On the positive side, the lyrical themes of the compositions are ambitious, the lyrics are certainly esoteric, and the song structures are interesting, but for me, great music combines these elements with superb technical musicianship, which includes vocals.  This album lacks such musicianship.  As a music fan who enjoys the technical excellence of jazz and improvisational rock, I have found much of the same skill on many prog rock albums, but not on this one.  \\"Still Life\\" offers brief moments of such skill, but listeners of Davis, Coltrane, Hendrix, and ELP alike will likely not be impressed.   If you're looking to get started in prog rock, try King Crimson, ELP, Yes, Jethro Tull, David Bowie, and even Frank Zappa first.
B00005QIPH|2.0|So I'd been hearing a lot about The Strokes' debut album Is This It. I'd been hearing that they are the savior's of today's alternative rock scene. A band with that kind of reputation should definitely be looked into, I decided. I ended up borrowing the album from a friend, eventually. Let me just say that I am terribly unimpressed. All twelve songs sound like one, boring, endless drone.<br />Okay, so that was a little harsh. Sometimes Julian Casablancas's voice warbles its way into your head. However, the songs are usually more interesting before the singing actually comes in. The simple, yet vaguely interesting, guitar riffs should probably replace the vocals altogether. Parts of the album have some catchy little hooks. Still, no matter how infectious, this doesn't change the fact that the tunes are simple, inexpressive, and void of emotion in general. By the last track, I wish the album would go ahead and end.<br />Sounding like Velvet Underground clones, even Elton John thinks their sound is too \\"retrogressive.\\" You'll like this album if you're into over commercialized, overrated bands that sound insanely similar to music of days gone by. Is this it? Is that what all the fuss was about? Apparently this IS it, and what a very little it turns out to be.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Funny, these film companies just don't get it!  You buy a DVD product thinking that your getting the best possible product you can buy.  Then a few months/years go by and the movie companies who market these movies think if they create some new packaging, put two discs in the package instead of one and market it with lame 'extra' film commentaries, the movie companies will make even more money!  WRONG!!<br />I love this movie!  No, I take that back, this movie rocks like no other!  It's a great concept and even though it doesn't live up to the brilliant original story of Robert Heinlein, it still delivers the goods for a new generation of film-goers!  What really doesn't fly with this new DVD release is that it's marketed to include supposed \\"new\\" material.  The problem is the original DVD provides the same material!  You aren't really treated to anything new in comparison to the original DVD.  The commentaries featuring the stars is boring with them talking about the marvels of CGI and how this and that happened on the set, tell us something we don't know!!<br />I encourage people, if you don't have the original \\"Starship Troopers\\" DVD-get it!  You will not be dissappointed!  It's got plenty of deleted scenes, commentary and featurettes to knock your socks off!  If you have not seen the CGI animated series, you need to get those too!  They're completely brilliant and fun to watch!<br />Steer clear of this marketing ploy!  The price is ridiculous for what your getting and the features are really nothing new, no matter how nice the new DVD cover looks!  Be well!

B000002LCX|5.0|&quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; is a fitting end to the music of The Smiths. The album starts off with &quot;A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours&quot; - a jangly tune and ends with &quot;I Won't Share You&quot; - sullen but simple tune. The mood of this album reflects the tensions that were happening within the group at the time. Most of the songs are under the 4 minute mark but still stand through the test of time. &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot; is an epic masterpiece of mood and melancholy. Morrissey's lyrics are fittingly perfect for Marr's minor chords.
B000007SIN|5.0|I was 18 when this &quot;album&quot; was released. Couldn't get enough of &quot;AJA&quot; and couldn't wait to spin THIS one on the old TT. Definitely a city-boy's record. Polar opposite from 'AJA', but then Fagen was ready for a solo effort which one will find this LP to be the genesis of &quot;THE NIGHTFLY&quot;... precise but absolutely beautiful in it's lyrical content and production. 20 years later, I read a review of the DTS version and now that I've got equipment to repro this amazing recording (arguably the best DTS available), I'll take it to my grave. With enough surround tweaking, I swear it's like again listing to QUADROPHONIC! The re-engineering brings the bkgd vocals of BABYLON SISTERS out front WHEW! (actually rear) IN YOUR FACE! Fagen in front, multi-instrumentals and backround vocals at rear and front! Nothing comes close! Further tweaking gives a different mix alltogther with GIANT SAX, GIANT PERCUSSION (beat for beat) and almost eerie raw vocal qualities that'll tear the ears right outta anyone who knows this album note-for-note. If you make one sonic investment in your life, make it this one! FIVE STAR PLUS PRODUCTION!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|First of all, people that make combinations of the words real, fans, of, and music.  This space is all about opinion, and to proclaim yourself as a real fan of music, or a fan of real music is in and of itself pretentious.  But, hey... what's wrong with being pretentious?<BR>With that out of the way, if you liked Kid A, you'll definitely love this one.  It's from the same sessions as Kid A, but these tracks have a very different feel.  The guitar makes a subtle come-back in this album for one.  The other is the overall feel of the album.  Kid A was overall very mystically positive... almost like a two-year-old that's fascinated with everything it sees.  This album is very negative... the tracks are haunting and spooky, making for an intense experience, but one you'll that'll make you thank the fact that you're sober and sane at the end (or are you?)  The emotion in the album is still as intense as Kid A, but turned in a different direction.  The cover describes this album perfectly.<br />A few of my favorites.  Pyramid song... this song is incredible in so many ways, but the most interesting thing is how you don't think the piano is playing a rhythm at the beginning of the song, then the drums come in after a few minutes and you get this really odd triplet feel; the song overall is just a very peaceful poignant song.  Pulk/Pull revolving doors... this is probably the weirdest song on the album with a very NIN feel to it, a perfect opposite for Pyramid Song.  Dollars and Cents... the strings really add to the feel of the song, although the lyrics seem a little too complaintive, if you don't pay attention to them (and you can't really tell what he's saying that easily anyway), the musical aspects of this song are trippy.  Like Spinning Plates... really really spooky... excellent climactic point to the album, the synth strings chill you to the bone.  The last track on the album is pointless if you haven't listened to the album all the way through.<BR>All in all, I doubt this album will make new fans, but it'll definitely keep old ones.  It's far too weird for pop culture, which is why we like it.  For those who thought Kid A was Radiohead's best album, this one's a good one for you.  However, those of you who think that probably already have this album.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have owned the original DVD for two years, and the VHS before it, and my husband and I watch it about every 6 months or so. It is always just as fresh as when we first watched it. It can definitely be enjoyed by everyone. It is action-packed - not like in a Stallone movie, but something does happen in every scene, and although this movie is in excess of 4 hours, it ends much too quickly. <BR>I bought the special edition, becuase of the extra &quot;making of&quot; and biographies of the cast it included. The digital imagery is pretty good; some cutting off of scenes, but still a very enjoyable film. The &quot;making of&quot; was very good to see, and did add to my experience, but it was not long enough... wish there was more. The biographies were written: you read them as well as you can read them with the literature included with the DVD case. The only problem - there are no other options on the DVD. No sub-titles, that I could find, in any language.
B000002O1Q|5.0|This soundtrack is one of my \\"desert island\\" picks. You know the routine, \\"what 10 albums/CDs would you want to have if you were stranded on a desert island ...\\" routine.<br />I've worn out two cassette copies and am ordering 2 new copies on CD for the house and the car. I'm on my second copy of the movie - if you're feeling low about life and such, put in the CD and crank up \\"Tonight is What it Means to be Young\\" or \\"Nowhere Fast\\". I guarantee you'll be on your feet before the song is over.<br />If you like hot horns and a good driving beat, \\"One Bad Stud\\" will do it for you. Unlike a LOT of other soundtracks that tie in the music and the movie with an eye on marketing, this is NOT the case here! This is one that plays well from the first track all the way through to the end. Put it in the CD player, select 'continuous play', and you're set for hours!<br />If you haven't seen the movie yet, watch it if only for the cast performances - Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan, Michael Pare, Diane Lane, a very young Willem DeFoe, even a small part for Bill Paxton! The blend of 50s settings, cars and clothing meshes beautifully with the driving music and 80s neon. They are worth the time.<br /><br />UPDATE - 2012.  Finally bought the DVD. Now I can see and hear it all through surround sound on a 52\\" screen. YIPPEE!
B000001DZQ|5.0|<br /><BR>If you're a guitarist or an afficionado of guitar music, you should have already heard Roy play.  If not, this is a great CD to start with.  This is a collection of songs from many different periods in his career, and it pretty well covers the gamut of what he did musically.  Even so, it'll just whet your appetite for more.  Buy this first, and you'll likely be out getting the rest of his releases.<br />Roy was recognized early-on by some of the true greats (Jeff Beck dedicated a song to him on Blow by Blow, he was offered a spot in the Rolling Stones, and he even played with Merle Haggard), but was not popular with the masses.  He never achieved the notoriety of many lesser guitarists.  I'll say this, and it sums up my opinion of Roy Buchanan... If you've never heard a guitarist play with feeling and raw emotion, this is your chance...  And this compilation is a good cross-section of his work.<br />Enjoy!<BR><br />
0792837614|4.0|I just love the songs in this movie. The cast did a wonderful job belting out the tunes. We watched this movie in drama class once and the next day everybody was still humming the songs. They are very hard to get out of your head! The acting was pretty good. Some of it is undeniably corny however. Also, Natalie Wood isn't too pleasing to look at in this movie. On the bright side, this a classic musical captured on film. A fun one for the whole family. You won't be able to stop thinking about it!
B00005ONMJ|2.0|I didn't like this performance other than Siepi who was OK.  Lisa Della Casa is one of the most irritating sopranos I've ever heard other than Mari Zampari who is at the top of my list of singers to avoid.  The acting was corny because of the dated performance (1954), sound quality was certainly not up to my standards of acceptance.  This is a Don I'll gladly give away to someone who can appreciate it because I couldn't.  I don't recommend unless someone wants to collect a historical performance of Don Giovanni on DVD.  The other four available are far superior.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Why do people judge this movie just because it has a love story in it.That was a very big mistake for them to do that.
B00005QK3W|5.0|His best album since Tug of War--even better than Flaming Pie. I love every track on this album--wonderful melodies (always his strength) and the album just keeps growing and growing on you.<br />Rock on, Paul!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a very good movie to watch,so I don't think people have the right to nominate this movie for 6 Razzines.I think you should watch this movie and make up your own opinion.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alright, this album does not suck.  It is not weird. It is not a disappointment (as some pathetic reviewer said in a review for her new album)<BR>This album is incredible, emotional, beautiful.  It is amazing.  It is better than Jagged Little Pill and Under Rug Swept (which both are also really good)<BR>After an artist breaks with a really big album such as Jagged Little Pill, their followup becomes hugely overhyped and in almost every case the album is considered \\"weird\\" just because it doesn't sound just like the first.  And when a followup does sound just like the one before everyone says the artist is uncreative and a fluke.  That's not right.<BR>Ok, enough politics, must focus on music.  Favorite song: The Couch (if you hear it once you will be dying to hear it again, and if you hear it more than once, you will start singing it, and you will be glad, because the song it beautiful, and even if your family thinks you're crazy for busting out with this song over the car radio, they're just jealous).  Joining you is also incredible, Baba to me is incredibly funny, but I think it's supposed to be.  Needless to say my least favorite song on this is the one hit Thank U I do like it though.  Most of the songs are about dysfunctional relationships: always a great topic in music.  I love UR I could really relate to it as a late-teenage girl trying desperately to find myself.<BR>Anyway, if you liked Alanis' first album, or if you didn't you really should try it.  Just don't expect another Jagged Little Pill. This really is on a whole different level.  Not to say that it's necessarily superior. It really is different, but not so incredibly different the same basic themes (relationships,religion) and sounds are still there, they are just changed a little bit.<BR>I love this album.  Buy it.  It will make you feel good inside, trust me.  Just one of these songs would do that.  But there are 17 whole songs on this album.  It's really a gift.  We are lucky to have this album, and we are lucky to have Alanis.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire was the right guy for that part. The story has a love base with Kirsten Dunst; some good laughs; a few tugs at your heart strings; and that vile Green Goblin made for lots of great action. I could tell by all those movie fans seated around me that they too enjoyed the show. Most were young high school and college kids. I can tell you I am no kid, I remember reading the Spider-Man Comic books when they hit the stands each month. I loved the hero then and I loved him in this movie. I heard that Maguire signed up for two sequels. I can't wait to see them.
0385335482|5.0|Ok, I have two confessions to make. One: I am a shopaholic + in many ways this book was painful (I'm not kidding).  Second: I had never laughed outloud at a book before until this one (And now my roommate thinks I'm crazy).<BR>Well being a shopaholic, I've wanted to read this book for a while, but I haven't had the time (too busy shopping, ya know?).  Anyway this book is absolutely hysterical.  The predicaments that the main character gets herself into, are just sooo funny.  Ok I loved Rebecca Bloomwood, I thought she was a great character, really believable.  A lot of people might think she was shallow or self-absorbed.  But isn't everybody at times? And if you say no, you're just lying, and you're not fooling anyone.  It's so obvious.  And anyways she has her deep moments, I will defend a fellow shopaholic to the death (real, fictional, it doesn't matter).<BR>Anyways, this story is a lot like a fairytale, you know there will be a happy ending.  The excitement is on seeing the trials and tribulations that Rebecca goes through.  And they are funny as hell. Seriously, if you have a sense of humor you will love this book.  If you love to shop and have a sense of humor about it you will absolutely adore and treasure this book.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Kudos to Raimi, and his entire staff.  This movie hits right at the core of the comic and edits its tales of the Green Goblin craftily into a film.  If you have never read the comic or are barely aware of the character, no fear; this movie has all the hallmarks of an excellent drama/action.  There is love, abuse, transformation, death, tradgedy, consequence, discovery, hate, humor and action all brilliantly woven together to spin a modern legend.  Infact, it's story made me appreciate how intense and thoughtful the comics were.  This movie packs more into 90 minutes then most recent movies which revolve around badly composed stories with no heart or pacing.  The criticism that the movie goes into tired web slinging at the end is ignorant since the action of the later half arises from the consequences of the first half, plus action is one of the hallmarks of the original work.  The beautiful CGI camera tracking of Spiderman swinging through Manhattan is mesmerizing and handled perfectly.  Raimi's comic book directing reminiscant of  'Darkman' and his classic movie uberpiece 'Evil Dead 2' while he can also tame the camera and composition into styles from his more recent dramas.  He took posing of the characters directly from the older comics by Ditko, Romita, Buscema and Kane which give them a heightened drama through the expressionless veneer of their costumes.  The actors are all really good in their roles, and while DeFoe might be hindered by the Green Goblin mask, a thin latex version might have had viewers asking why Peter Parker couldn't figure Osbourne's true identity immediately since DeFoe's face is rather goblinesque already.  By cutting around the rather clunky head piece adroitly they avoid any real difusion of the character's potency.  As the tale of a besieged loser transforming into a kind of secret demi-god finding greater good and tradgedy through the consequnce of his changes this movie plays perfectly.  Every positive aspect is soon balanced by a greater negative then surpassed by a higher positive and so forth until the film ignites in moral dilemma and action abound.  My only negative was the end credit music which was a mash of [sound].  Why not use the Ramone's version of the Spiderman cartoon from the 60's and perhaps fade in and out of instrumental and techno versions instead of a collection of pop tunes?  Minor fault indeed.  This movie should break box office due to it's amiable although tragic characters and well paced action.
B0000024K1|5.0|Public Enemy shall go down in history as one of the greatest Hip-<BR>Hop/Rap groups of all time, and certainly as the greatest \\"conscious\\" rap group of all-time. \\"It Takes A Nation of Millions\\" is P.E.'s seminal work, though an argument can easily be made that Public Enemy equalled the ante with \\"Fear Of A Black Planet.\\"<br />As a freshman at Florida A &M in college, I was just beginning to develop into consciousness, when I heard the song \\"Don't Believe The Hype.\\"  The sample, Chuck D's voice, and Terminator X's scratches on this hit song are awesome, and I went out and bought the tape cassette on the strength of that one song. Equally engrossing tracks are \\"Bring The Noise\\", \\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\" (which features searing condemnations against drug pushers), \\"Can I get a witness\\", and \\"Louder Than A Bomb\\", and \\"Rebel without a pause\\".  However, I would errant if I failed to include easily one of the greatest songs to grace rap music-Black Steel In the Hour of Chaos.  Chuck D speaks to the issues of Black Men serving in the military, mistreatment of Blacks (and really by implication Latino's, poor Whites, and others)in the judicial system, and prison atrocities.  I don't think I have ever heard a album so awesomely representing a fusion of funk, soul, rock, and heavy-metal, that comes out super-smooth, like this one.  And the entire CD is superb. Public Enemy's music has spread to Europe and Asia, and their concerts are attended by a diverse crowd.<br />Really, people slept on P.E. because their first CD was not really hardcore pro-black, pro-consciousness, and pro-humanity. (Yo Bum Rush the Show).  So for those who didn't know the group, this CD woke up the world. And as a result, made it easier for people like Ice Cube, Kam, Tupac (in his conscious songs), Brand Nubian, King Sun, and others to come positive later on.  <br />Some reviewers do an injustice to this CD, by claiming its racist. Minster Farrakhan is quoted, and in fact, the listener is challenged not to draw any conclusion for or against the Minster in the lyrics from \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\", \\"don't tell me you understand the man, until you hear the man!\\" Indeed, Public Enemy even takes it further by espousing Black pride, consciousness, and knowledge of ones history. The album must be read, therefore, in the context of the late 80's and early 90's when crimes and atrocities against people of color where on the rise (not that I saw times have changed), crack-cocaine was (and still is) decimating the innercity, television (note the song, \\"She watches Channel Zero) was not (and still is not) teaching any value, only subverting values, and the U.S. Government's foreign and domestic policy agenda was continuing to cause other nations problems.(and obviously, there are still people in the world who disagree.  Hopefully, a better way to \\"disagree\\" can be found without claiming lives.)<br />Taken in and out of this context, I would recommend this CD more than any other, not just because its good listening and fun, it marked the rememergence of interest in Black leaders such as Malcolm X (who went on to appear on a stamp, after PE noted that most stamps at the time didn't have black heroes (Fight the Power song from Do the Right Thing/Fear of A Black Planet)) and others. Moreover, it also signaled to all of America that Minister Farrakhan had perspectives that should be listened to-whether the listener agreed or disagreed with him.  Thus a new generation of people who had never heard of legendary black heroes and who didn't know anything about the controversy of domestic and foreign policy were called to the carpet-to give a listen.
B00003CY6M|1.0|This film epitomizes trite romantic comedy formula.  It's as though ingredients were thrown onto an assembly line and Serendipity came out in the end.  You'll notice this with the very first scene: an establishing shot of New York City at Christmas time.  We hear Louis Armstrong in the score.  Does this immediately seem familiar?  John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale fight over a pair of gloves in Bloomingdales.  Both are attracted to each other, but she refuses to move the relationship in the right direction citing that Fate should decide.  All he's asking for is a phone number.  I suppose if they did hook up in the first scene, the movie's over.<br />Without revealing too many details, an annoying child in an elevator (dressed as the Devil - what symbolism!) avoids Fate from joining the two back together initially.  We're then left with 80 more minutes of the two of them trying to get back together.<br />I'm not opposed to the romantic comedy formula, so long as the characters and plot keep it engaging and somewhat realistic.  This film is devoid of THOSE ingredients.
B00004XOWM|5.0|You all hate on Limp Bizkit because it's trendy to do so. You say that only the trendy people listen to this to be cool, nope opposite. I know you all are Closet Limp fans so shut up. Anyways to get on with the actual CD. The CD isn't the best CD ever and it never tries to be. This CD infuses tech w/ heavy riffs and rap beats/lyrics. The best song in my opinion is Boiler because well basically its the best alright. Xzibit is one of the better rappers out on the scene and one of the few i can stand to listen to. Method and Redman's appearence is less then well good but its the last real song so all of ya can deal with pressing the skip button. Ben Stiller's laugh track is great and he keeps up his legend of comedic excellence. The only real letdown other then the rapversion of Rollin' is Take A Look Around which, as good a song as it is, was on Mission Impossible and played enough to get its point across. It should of added discarded track Back O' Da Bus instead of wasting the time with that. Anyways this CD is worth the money but I know all of you already own it and listen to it nightly. Later
0385503954|5.0|'Atonement' is first Ian McEwan novel I've read and in the moments that followed turning the final page I can honestly say it is with great regret that it has taken me this long to become acquainted with his work. Such is the impeccable characterisation, the tightly controlled prose and the sumptuous description that the reader is willingly fed, the plaudits attributed to this novel have been totally vindicated and are wholly deserved.<br />Like Sebastian Faulks, McEwan returns to the heart of middle-class England in 1935 where 13 year-old Briony Tallis and her family are holding a family gathering with their cousins from the North of England. Briony is intending on performing her latest play, 'The Trials of Arabella' whilst casting her cousins in different parts but whilst her ambition is tempered by their distinct lack of enthusiasm, she later finds an audience in the most surprising of circumstances. Also attending this meeting are Celia Tallis, a recent Cambridge graduate, who is accompanied by her close friend Robbie Turner, an English graduate planning a career in the field of medicine. The pres-cis on the back of the hardback edition hints less than subtly as to what lies at the heart of this novel but that is an issue that I intend to steer clear of. Quite simply, McEwan actively encourages the reader's own exploration with promises of glorious prose and a rewarding conclusion to those that take up the challenges within these perfectly-toned pages.<br />McEwan manages to maintain what seems to be a recent tradition amongst English novelists by taking his readers to the foreign battlefields of France at the height of the warfare but, significantly, refuses to concern himself with epic conflicts and heroic rescues. Whilst the reader unavoidably becomes emotionally entangled with the soldiers, it is their mental trauma and horrors that are brought to the fore whilst the writer's pen is wielded as expertly as the surgeon's scalpel in the military hospital whereBriony now works. At this point you could be forgiven that this has become a war novel or a romance but in all honesty it is hard to try and pin down what genre 'Atonement' occupies. There are times when is it none of these, other times it promises to evolve into one or the other but each potential development is simply a bandage covering the deeper wounds that lie beneath the surface. <br />I confess that this review will shed little light on the actual narrative and plot of this novel but then to reveal it would be a tragedy as well as a travesty. You will have to persevere with 'Atonement' but there are certainly rewards to be reaped by the end. Many people have told me that this is the culmination of McEwan's previous works, that it is his finest work to date but since this is my first experience of his novels I'm not at liberty to agree or disagree. What I can say is that this is a novel that should be read, reread and then treasured.
B000002MY3|5.0|This may be the best rock album I have heard in 10 years.  The<BR>combination of extremely intelligent lyrics and driving rock guitar are addictive.  You will want to listen to this CD over and over again.
0553274503|5.0|Flowers for Algernon has got to be one of the best and surprising reads I've had. A friend of mine introduced me to Daniel Keyes and told me this was a read I just had to make. <BR>Keyes takes us through the life of a man who gets to experience life at two great extremes. Keyes instantly grabs the reader's attention with literally just the first page. He creates characters that you'll truly never forget. His development of the plot keeps you turning page after page in anticipation of what's going to happen next. I honestly could not put this book down once I opened it and read it in the span of ten hours. I was so captivated by the life that this book brought to life that I would not allow myself sleep until I knew its conclusion.<BR>I would not recommend you start this book on a busy or late day. It'll you keep you up all night. It kept me up until 3 a.m. This is a book (and a story) unlike any I've ever read before. Keyes' writing style also makes the story flow from beginning to end without you ever missing a single moment or idea. If you have never read Daniel Keyes before, this is the place to start.
B00004WIBW|5.0|This Movie is soooo great! I would rate it 5 stars for GREAT acting, they look like they are doing it for real, instead of just acting, they live it. The special effects aren't super good, but okay, some puppets are used for skeletons, ghosts etc. Violence is what this movie is rated R for. For absolutely NO reason blood squarts out, TONS of blood squarts out when a guy gets his head cut off, but we have the blood in us, so who cares? The bad words are rated 1/10, there is really none. Sexuality 2/10, there is some kissing. So this movie is Violent and Gorey, but a good plot.<BR><BR><BR>PLOT: A headless horseman comes to Sleepy Hollow in New York in 1799, and chops off people's heads until he finds his. He got his head chopped off after fighting some people. So I would recemmend kids shouldnt watch this cause it might give you nightmares. <BR><BR><BR>Rated R for Graphic Violence<br />Starring: Johnney Depp, Christina Ricki, Christopher Walken

I know what an extraordinary story this is and have tried to turn others on to it.<BR>Bob Mason's transformation from eager pilot trainee to jaded combat veteran/burnout, while probably not anymore remarkable a story than any other pilot's is well written and that is what makes it great! After reading the book I felt as though I know Bob Mason. Not a bad thing.<BR>When Mason describes the deck inside the chopper,covered in blood you can almost smell it.<BR>Serious life and death stuff with some of the funniest stories of human screw ups wrapped up in a truly memorable account of one<BR>helluva chopper pilots' experience in Vietnam.<BR>It's like I say:\\" 'Chickenhawk' is the best damn war movie they never made!\\"
B00005J4HH|5.0|I couldn't say enough if you let me use 1,000,000 to describe this album.  I'll just say this - Radiohead and the Foo Fighters have been knocked of the pedestal.....with a vengance.

B00005JKCF|3.0|i liked this movie. but... yes but it seemed weak and slow and sometimes boring. i liked tobey maguires portrayal, his mannerisms and he did an excellent job playing Peter Parker. The one liners and punchlines were few but nonetheless funny. still it makes for a good popcorn flick. maybe the dvd will have some cool extras...
0307165485|5.0|When I ordered this book for a friend's seven-year old I thought it was a little pricey for a children's book. I assumed, without looking, that it was like most children's book, maybe 40 or 50 pages.  Actually, it's 288 pages chocked full of colorful drawings and stories which delighted the young lady I gave it to.  Now, I consider the book a bargain.  I'm sure I'll be buying more Richard Scarry books in the future.
0790729628|3.0|This is the only movie that I can recall where the director's version is worse than the theatrical release.  The loss of the narrative (which was the only way I understood the movie the first time I saw it) is not worth the brief unicorn dream scene that was added back.  I remember an interview (I think it was with Johnny Carson) where Rutger Hauer mentioned the unicorn dream scene and was shocked to find out that it was cut from the theatrical release.  When the director's cut came out, my dad and I saw it on VHS and were both terribly dissapointed. I wish I could get the other version on DVD.
B00003CXDD|3.0|This movie was good.  I liked the fantasy in it.  It was casted well, such as Val Kilmer, who is a seriously underrated actor, and the sets were great.  But the movie took too long to progress and it seemed like the movie went on longer than it really was.  Legend and Labyrinth's stories seemed to move in a fast paste manner.  Anoher problem was the story was hard to get into.  There didn't seem to be anything interesting in the story.  Good special effects.  If you want a good fantasy flick besides Harry Potter or Lord Of The Rings, I suggest Legend or Labyrinth.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow!!! I'm not a critic so I don't have all those fancy words to use about movies. All I can say is....\\"If you want 2 hours of one hell of a movie, then cart your [rear] to the nearest theater and cough up some cash for a ticket to Spiderman.\\" This movie rocked!!!! Great special effects with an outstanding plot and not too mention some totally funny scenes. This movie had it all and unless your one of those people that \\"analyze\\" every little detail, you won't regret seeing this.
0812550706|5.0|You always liked those books you could never put down eh? Those ones sooo exciting, you just never want it to end? Well, I'm telling you this is one of those books! I have read it 7 times, yes, 7 times! Orson Scott Card is an awesome book writer, and im telling you, that you should get Ender's Game. Its about a boy, named \\"Andrew Wiggin\\"(Everyone calls him Ender) who was born specificly to be sent up to battles school to save the world from the terrifying \\"Buggers\\"(What the humans call the aleans) who attecked them twice and newarly wiped the human race out.<BR>Now Ender must train to become the savior of the Human Race, even though he doesnt quite know that at first. <BR>If you want a book, i HIGHLY recomend you buy this one!

0385505833|1.0|This book is so horrible, it's hard to believe that John Grisham could have written it. The storyline is unbelievably<br />implausible and very poorly written.  Someone decides to take a cruise over the Christmas holidays and not decorate; hmmmmmmm.  This is a reason for the Spanish Inquisition.  The entire neighborhood is up in arms; yep, it happens every Christmas, doesn't it?  I really like Grisham's other books but this one is just plain stupid!
B00005QZWI|5.0|As soon as I saw the movie, I knew I had to get the sountrack recording and I certainly wasn't disappointed. This is an amazing piece of work. We have featured not only the London Symphony Orchestra and voices, but also the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra which is equally awesome. This must be a complete change of direction for the Reprise recording company - it's their only sountrack I've heard from them. The company was started by Frank Sinatra. From the beginning of the CD, 'The Prophecy' to Enya's incredible 'May It Be' is sheer joy.
B000062XMO|4.0|Ok, all the ex-military viewers who have been in similar (very rare) situations have chimed in about how the dialogue did not fit the situation.  Or else that was just a bunch of movie watchers that object to things being said differently than Rambo would have said it.  Either way, consider the possibility that it takes a pretty cool customer to survive that type of situation. <br />This movie combined many of the new directing techniques that have been evolving in the last few years. They contribute to the energy and (I'm assuming) the realism of some action scenes, which are pretty spectacular in this movie.  The plot had enough twists to make it unique and interesting compared to many of the past \\"find the lost soldier\\" films over the years.  It added some depth to the story.<br />Granted the bad guys couldn't shoot straight, but they didn't have too many clear opportunities (until the end), and John Wayne got famous battling gunmen who apparently lost all motor skills upon drawing their weapons.  The ending belonged in a James Bond film, all we needed was a babe pulling him into the helicopter.  I was pleased enough with the rest of the movie to overlook that.

0345413377|4.0|Let's see...if you want to be depressed for a week after reading an exciting, wonderful book that just happens to have a horrible ending, read The Amber Spyglass.<br />It all starts out great.  Will, the bearer of the subtle knife, sets out on a journey to save Lyra from Mrs. Coulter, her dreadful mother who finally realizes her love for Lyra after all these years.  Once Will rescues Lyra, the two decide to visit the world of the dead, where their loved ones are suffering after their horrible deaths.  When the duo actually arrives, they experience the heartbreak of losing their daemons as well as as the feeling of anxiety and overwhelming fear.  However, with the help of John Parry (Will's dead father), Rodger (Lyra's dead friend), and the other dead ghosts, they mangage to open a window into the real world.  With the help of friends, Will and Lyra are able to escape the war between Heaven and Earth that Lyra's parents are involved in.  Soon, though, after all the trauma, Will and Lyra start to realize their undying love for eachother.  But, just when the now \\"couple\\" was having the time of their lives and finding themselves in a deeper love than anyone could imagine, they learn that they can't be together.<br />So...after reading this amazing (and now ruined) book, I was furious.  Why would you end such a well-written, award-winning, exciting book in such a depressing way?  It doesn't make sense.

B00004TJFL|4.0|I was kind of disappointed with this movie. There was a REALLY great cliffhanger ending at the end of pt. 4 that could have been used so well in this movie that was just completely ignored. Instead, Michael comes back to do his routine and to stalk his now-mute niece. True, this isn't a very bad film. The directing style is really good. The movie actually feels like it is Halloween. Of course, it's typical 80's slasher, so if you hate that, you'll hate this. I hated almost every character in this movie, especially Tina, so this was the first time I found myself cheering Michael on. There is a minor subplot of Michael and some guy in a black coat following him around (Watch pt. 6) that should have, in my opinion, been left out of the movie. And what is up with the Myer's house? I'm not the only one who noticed how big this place has gotten since the first movie! In the original it was just a regular looking house, like you or I would live in. In this one, it's a freaking mansion! But flaws aside, Halloween 5 is good slasher fun. Just turn off your brain during viewing and you'll be just fine.
0714834491|4.0|Difficult to tell you what this book actually says, except that it's author is a genius.  Or at least he quotes lots of other people who are.<br />But whatever the author is saying, I agree with it.  It's about expressing interesting thoughts in a visually interesting way in a conceptually interesting arrangement.  I am a smarter, richer, wiser, person for having read it, but I can't say how. <br />(This isn't going to earn me many helpful votes, is it?)

B00005JKCF|5.0|Hi I just saw Spider-Man the movie, it was awesome. I loved the way they stayed true to so much of the original idea of Spider-Man, having him start out as this geeky kid, then being transformed into so much more. The special effects will Blow you away, there were so many great scenes I want to see it again and again so I can be excited all over again. I've read Spider-Man comic books since I was a kid and  I felt the movie did a great job of bringing Spider-Man to life.
B00005R5G9|4.0|I'm not usually into cutesy and/or lighthearted humor, or slapstick comedy outside of the Three Stooges and Chris Farley. But after taking a look at `Mannequin' for the first time in several years, I think I can make an exception in this instance. Filled with many instances of the aforementioned comedy subgenres, this light and enjoyable romantic comedy-fantasy is a nice change of pace from the heavier action & sci-fi fare I usually watch. And alongside `Xanadu', `Buckaroo Banzai', and `Back to the Future', `Mannequin' really stands out as a notable showcase of the styles & fashion that made the 80s so memorable! Ah, pink spandex and pastel-colored narrow neckties...<br />Especially enjoyable was Meschach Taylor's overwhelmingly over-the-top portrayal of `Hollywood' Montrose, an unabashed and definitely out-of-the-closet stereotype of gaiety. I never thought I'd see the day when Mr. Humphries from the BBC series `Are You Being Served?' would be outdone in the flamboyance department! GW Bailey as the department store security guard brings inept bumbling to new heights, with a little of that `Police Academy' anal-retentive authority-figure clowning thrown in for good measure! And how can I forget the titular star, Kim Cattrall! I don't know about the rest of you guys out there, but I was definitely feelin' the ol' raging hormones whenever she stepped into frame! Ooh yeah! Whoops, gotta cut this short, `cuz it's cold shower time...<br />`Late!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just saw this movie on opening night here and as expected, it was packed. I waited for 3 hours before getting my ticket, but it was worth it. The special effects were breath-taking, the cast was the best, the showdown was excellent. I think this is better than the Matrix. It only had one problem that would have givin it 3 stars, but the plot, cast, special effects, and showdowns were too good. The problem was that most of the movie's special effects moved so fast, it was impossible to watch it all without getting a headache. But, this is the best movie I have ever seen. It is a must see to ever Marvel marveller and to newcomers as well.

0553573403|1.0|Martin is one of the worst writers I have ever read in my entire life. He wouldn't haven't a clue if you handed him one. The child sex scenes with adults alone should be enough to give readers a clue that this is the sort of drivel that gives fantasy a bad name. If I read about another clueless 1 dimensional character I'm going to run away screaming. Were the editors of this book asleep at the wheel as well? Martin frequently confuses and misplaces pronouns, nouns and adverbs. I learned how to write better in the sixth grade. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
6304071868|5.0|As the title indicates, British, Polish and American paratroopers displayed tremendous heroism fighting German paratroopers and Panzer Divisions in an effort to \\"end the war by Christmas,\\" in 1944.  The cast speaks for itself in terms of the big names that came together to honor the sacrifices so eloquently described in Cornelius Ryan's book of the same name.  The movie and book do an admirable job of accurately portraying the series of actions from drop zones to bridges in the different division sectors.  <br />The movie brings out the zeal of the commanders, vying for resources and trying to \\"get into the fight\\" before the war is over.  Ego drives LTG Browning to ignore intelligence that confirms known Panzer units in the area of Arnhem.  Lack of pre-combat checks sends the British into battle without adequate communications.  The informed viewer will pick up on the folly of attacking along a single road without having the flexibility to maneuver mechanized forces along multiple axes of advance.  Although the paratroopers represent some of the best fighters in the war, without proper lines of resupply and communication light infantry cannot hold out long against armored forces.  The director commendably brings to light many of the problems the 82nd, 101st and British 1st Para had during the battle, as well as the tremendous bravery exhibited.  The 82nd's forced daylight river crossing and the British stand at Arnhem symbolize two high points of the battles.<br />This is a classic and should be appreciated by anyone who enjoys war movies or has served in the military.  Highly recommended!
B00005JKCF|4.0|An avid fan of Spider-man for the past two decades, I had considerable expectations going into this movie. The good news is that Spider-man is not that bad. In fact, after the first hour I was prepared to surrender the comic book movie crown previously held by Richard Donner's Superman over to the web head. But, like a John Carpenter movie, Spider-man begins well and runs out of steam at the end. Peter Parker, a gangly science nerd with brainpower to spare and meek social skills, gets bit by a genetically engineered spider with enhanced abilities built into its genome. As a result, Parker finds himself mutating into a spider-man with the proportional abilities of the spider that bit him. Now the hopeless geek that nobody respected suddenly finds incredible powers at his command. This part of the film is done particularly well. As the truism goes, power corrupts. Peter employs his abilities to clobber a boy that frequently bullied him, Flash. It only begins there. In order to impress his childhood sweatheart he decides he needs a car. The best way to obtain one? Beat up guys as a wrestler and collect the prize money! Inevitably personal tragedy teaches Parker that with great power comes great responsibility and he decides to use his powers to help the innocent people of New York City. Spider-man is born. This is kept perfectly in line with the comic and won't disappoint any true believers out there. The problems begin when the villainous Green Goblin confronts Spider-man. From this point on Spider-man eschews any type of innovation and resorts to the simple 'good vs. evil' plot. And that simple formula becomes ridiculus culminating when Goblin decides that Spider-man is the only other person on the planet that is his equal and tries to lure the web slinger over to the dark side. I kid you not, the dialogue and even the physicality are a direct lift from Empire Strikes Back. It's scenes such as these that truly interrupt the flow of the film and they only increase innumber towards the end of the movie. This could have been forgiven had the battle segments been spectacular. Instead they are a mix of outrageously overblown CGI and sub-par stunt work that are both unispired and lifeless. Perhaps the reason they are so inert is equally inert Danny Elfman score(Batman)that fails to energize or even create a mood. But all is not lost for Spidey, Tobey Maguire and Willem Defoe (Parker and Goblin respectively) give showstopping performances that overcome the plot's shortcomings. Maguire is the perfect Parker conveying both emotional frailty and boyish charm. Defoe is his match as the schizophrenic Green Goblin, a man consumed with the need to remove all obstacles to his success. Supported by a fine cast of costars you can't help but enjoy Spider-man even if you do experience a constant feeling of deja vu. I can't wait for the sequel and I suggest everyone who appreciates a healthy dose of fantasy see the movie. Only don't expect any surprises along the way. Spidey might not have any new ideas to spin, but his web is in the right place.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Just went to see this movie and it is marvelous. Kudos to Sam Raimi for staying faithful to the source material.<BR>Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker, and Willem Dafoe was terrific as the Green Goblin. Don't take the movie so seriously and just go and enjoy it, and when the movie is over, think to yourself... Wow! I wonder who he'll fight next, Doctor Octopus, how about the Lizard or maybe the Kingpin or...
0446608955|5.0|I had heard of this book, I rented the book on tape. Nicholas Sparks reads it. My view of this. I am not into sad,romance books but this book is sad. It's about Jamie who struggles meets Landon and teaches him new things. I would reccomend this great book and it will change you. I recently rented the DVD and Nicholas Sparks did a good job doing the commentary. I would suggest you read the book first!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The DVD as many reviewers have stated here is great in the feature department. I lot of goodies for people that enjoy how a film is put together. Excellent commentary features and the DVD web exclusive feature also good. The film itself was not bad but everyone has pointed out the horrible parts already so i won't go over that again. One final note even the menu selection is very cool too.
0811826848|5.0|The Beatles story is an incredibly fascinating one.  In so many ways their history is not merely of a musical group, even a great one.  The Beatles transcended mere music.  From 1962-1970, the entire period of their recording career, the Beatles recorded hundreds ofbrilliant songs, groundbreaking albums and lived enough advenutre to fill a lifetime.  When this book was published, the three surviving Beatles had lived more than twice as many years since the breakup as the entire time the group was together.  It is really remarkable to read (or see in the video) McCartney, Starr and Harrison talking about the Beatle's times from the perspective of late middle age.  The story itself will be familiar to any Beatle's fan.  The early days in Britain, the crazy days of Beatle mania, the acid drenched mid-sixties when the times began to influence the Beatle's sound and the Beatle's music so headily influenced the times.   The flirtation with Indian religion, the death of Brian Epstein, Yoko Ono, the slowly growing rigt and finally the acrimonious breakup.  All in an incredible 8 years.  What makes this book unique, even from earlier books that quote the Beatles is the perspective of time which has clearly mellowed the three surviviors.  Lennon's quote's are necessarily taken from before his death in 1980 and it is interesting to see how his failure to reach middle age lends a different perspective to his memories of the Beatles, in his case memories less than fifteen years old.  How fascinating to hear Paul and George discussing the making of \\"Let it Be\\" where the bitterness was clear.  Paul essentially apologizes and it is nice to know he and George settled their differences before Harrison's death late last year.  Not only do I recommend this book, it cannot be missed by anyone interested in the Beatle's history in their own words.  No other auto-biography will be as comprehensive for one reason.  It will require much of the book to focus on pre and post Beatles years.  As I stated, the Beatles recording career lasted 8 years.  Today a top band would record at most three albums in that time.  Don't miss the book or the video collection
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was able to skip work to see this film in the afternoon and already there was a big crowd.<br />I have been a fan of Spiderman since I was 5 years old. My sister feels most films about sci-fi or super hero to be garbage. Well this film pleased us both and in my opinion has to be one of the best adaptation of a comic book hero to the big screen.<br />Th special effects were very good, the acting by Tobey and company also very good. What I enjoyed the most was the humor that the film had. One thing that Spiderman fans like about the hero is the humor.<br />The film will appeal to die-hard fans to even people that know nothing about Spiderman. I can't wait for the future sequels and the hype did match the film quality.
0767812166|5.0|I was touched deeply by this &quot;corny&quot; movie about the love<BR>between Karen Allen, a grieving widow, and Jeff Bridges, her alien lover. The performances were exquisite: Jeff's attempts at being human, like the first drag on a cigarette, were hilarious and touching, as was Karen's innocent responses. Something about the movie just grabbed me as few movies have.
B000060OWV|2.0|I have been a Robben Ford fan since the Court &amp; Spark tour and have seen him play whenever I hear about it.  I buy all Robben's CDs and will continue to buy his CDs, but since '97 I have given them away. I love the blues (The Mint gig with Roscoe ruled), and I love jazz (Detroit with Miles was awesome), but I don't love Robben's recent recordings.  Save your money and go seen some fine players at your local blues club tonight.
B000002JSN|5.0|Think about it.  What is the best single vinyl (both sides) or single disc you have ever heard?  For me, it is sides 1 and 2 of Physical Graffiti.  The thumping, blues rock riffs of Custard Pie, followed by the heavy metal anthem of the Rover, and ending with perhaps the best rock epic ever written/played, Kashmir--  Robert Plant's poetic and melodic tribute to one of the better novels of the 20th century, Lost Horizon.  It is amazing that Plant could read anything printed, let alone novels, considering all the drugs and sex.<br />Tucked in between these three brilliant tracks are the underrated In My Time of Dying with its blues guitar clinic provided by Page, the overplayed Trampled Underfoot, and the inspired Houses of the Holy, a song with an experimental and unique guitar riff that puts off many non-Zeppelin fans because it is not what they expect.
B000050XEI|5.0|I am a very high strung person who just can't seem to unwind. I was suffering with a neck injury, so I was referred to a massage therapist. At first, she just couldn't get me to relax. Then she put in this CD. I couldn't believe it, but for the first time that I could remember, I was completely relaxed! This CD is the most peaceful &amp; settling piece of music put together that I've heard. Anytime that I feel completely strung out I just put in this CD and get lost in the music....great piece of work!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I saw the movie opening night. I was expecting it to be good but kind of expecting it (with the way movies are these days) to be way to fast like Peter gets bitten by this spider and then in a matter of 10 minutes he becomes Spider-Man. But this movie had everything a classic superhero movie requires: Time. Time for the hero to be able to realize what he can do with his powers and maybe about a half and hour to 45 minutes into the movie he becomes the real Spider-Man. And that is exactly what this movie had.<br />The movie starts of with Peter Parker, a senior in highschool who has been pretty much the classic movie \\"nerd\\" at the beginning. He has been in love with the girl that lives next door to him, Mary Jane. But you know the story: She has some big jock boyfriend and she dosn't even notice Peter. So then one day while they are all on a field trip looking at a spider exhibit, a spider with all of the abilities of different spiders put together gets loose and bites Peter. The next morning Peter wakes up and goes through the day learning that he has incredible strength, agility, keen spider scenses, the ability to shoot webs, and the ability to climb walls. <br />His best friend, however, has a rich father who is working on a new kind of experiemnt: A type of superhuman thing that leads whoever it is tested on to become very violent and angry. He tests it on himself and eventullay leads himself to complete insanity. And as you probably already know he becomes the Green Goblin. But the problem is Spider-Man does not know that the Green Goblin is his best friend's father which comes out in an incredible ending that will definitly have a sequal.<br />The Spider-Man movie made me think of all the different superhero movies that I watched when I was younger. All of the superhero movies now though just start to fast and end in dissapointment. But Spider-Man was just like watching the past superhero movies (Batman, Superman, etc.) Come back for a trip to the future. Thiswas truly a great and fun movie and I reccomend it to anyone who is looking for an action packed classic superhero story.
B000002B2T|5.0|Thanks alot Layne for your voice and humor in the music world.  You will be missed.

6305692572|5.0|Get out the kleenex!  <br />Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan gave wonderful performances as Alice and Michael Green. I thought this movie showed a very realistic look at alcoholism and the effects on a family.  Andy, as Michael, the ever caring, loving, devoted husband looking after his girls, and not seeing a problem exists.  Meg, as Alice, insecure and able to hide her drinking from everyone but her children, Jess and Casey.  When Alice is forced to face her demons, everyone has to come to grips with their own insecurities and the truth.  <br />&quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, it's amazing what the outcome can be!

0446525537|5.0|Written with plenty of local color and slang, this book didn't seem like it would be that good to me at first. It's one of those too-innocent and unrealistic types, but that's probably why I like it. <br />The book is about Landon, a high school senior who ends up in drama class because he doesn't want to take the &quot;difficult&quot; classes like chem, physics or advanced math. To say is taken aback by Jamie's beauty from the beginning is a lie, Jamie is regarded as weird because she does good deeds and reads the Bible during lunch.<br />Jamie and Landon end up with starring roles in the senior play, Landon wants to be nice to Jamie because he owes her a favor, but is worried about preserving his reputation. Being seen with nice people is too unpopular.<br />One begins to wonder about Jamie when she starts talking about her goals in life. She says all she wants is to get married. At the time, it seems like a silly goal, but she's with holding a secret that changes everything. It's easy reading, but does the job nicelt. It's a book you'll remember for a long time, inspirational, sad, and beautiful.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Guy Pearce is a scientist who develops a time machine to save his ill-fated fiancee. Unfortunately, disaster strikes again, and he heads toward the future, only to discover human society is doomed. Modern adaptation of H.G. Wells classic novel isn't very faithful to its source, but remains a fairly spirited and always enjoyable sci-fi adventure. Plot holes are abound, logic is questionable at best, and the movie somehow loses some momentum when it kicks 800,000 years(!) into the future, but Pearce's likeable performance, the intriguing story, and competent direction keeps this film surging forward. On a technical level, the special effects and score are both effective, the former sometimes being even quite spectacular, as seen in the time-traveling sequences .<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
B00003CX5P|4.0|The Phantom Menace was the biggest hit of 1999.  The movie has spectacular special effects and a great soundtrack.  It does have flaws, though.  The story line isn't bad, but the acting could have been a whole lot better.  Also, Jar Jar is incredibly annoying!<BR>OK, here's the story:32 years before the first Star Wars movie, Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gonn(Liam Neeson), 2 Jedi Knights, are sent to stop a blockade of a small planet.  After they get the picture the planet's being taken over, the Jedi rescue the queen(Natile Portman) and head to the planet Coracaunt to get help from the Galantc Republic.  On the way, they get stranded on Tatoine and meet Anikin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd) and his mother Shmi(Prunilla August), who help the Jedi get off the planet.<BR>If you have a dvd player, get the dvd. It has a documentary,deleted scenes, a commentary, and about a bajillion other extras.<BR>This is a good movie, but watch it with an open mind.  Don't think it'll be as good as the first Star Wars movies, 'cause it just isn't that good. On its own it's a pretty good movie.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is an amazing film. David Lynch's latest masterpiece is about a woman named Diane Selwyn whose girlfriend, Camilla, has just dumped her for a man. Diane goes to sleep and has a dream. In the dream, Diane has control over everything she doesn't in real life, e.g her girlfriend, her acting career. In her dream, her girlfriend Camilla is about to be murdered by two hitman when the limo she's driving is hit by a speeding car. Camilla survives, but she suffers from amnesia. Meanwhile, Diane has pictured herself as an aspiring actress named Betty who is coming to Hollywood to become a movie star. Betty takes Camilla in, who calls herself Rita, and takes care of her. Later, Betty has a stunning audition and becomes sexually involved with Rita. After Diane (Betty) wakes up, we see events unfold that explain why Betty had that dream and the motivations behind why certain characters acted the way they did. The movie ends with Betty meeting with a hitman to set up a hit on her now ex-girlfriend Camilla.<br />This film took me two viewings to understand. The film's narrative style is very unconventional. This film reminded me of Christopher Nolan's films like Following and Memento in the way the story was told. The story was hard to follow, but since most of the movie is a dream, this style was appropriate. There were a few great scenes in this film. They are the kind of scenes that stay with you, with characters that jump out of the screen at you. <br />What amazed me about this film was the distinctive personality traits that made each character unique. The Cowboy was stoic and sarcastic. Adam comes home and sees his wife in bed with another man. He takes her jewelry box and pours paint in it. The man who drinks the expresso, which is considered one of the \\"finest expressos in the world\\", spits it out on his napkin. The hitman (in Betty's dream) is portrayed as inept and clumsy. This was an excellent recipe for good comic relief and it worked.<br />There wasanother thing I noticed in this film that was very well done. When Adam pours the paint on his wife's jewelry box, he mixes it in with his hands and gets the paint all over his shirt. This was a way to carry over that color to subsequent scenes, and hence, added color to them. Adam's paint covered shirt gave him a personality. It added life to a scene that would have been ordinary with him just wearing a black shirt. I know this wasn't an accident.<BR>\\"Mulholland Drive\\" was terrific.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is definitely one of the best albums that I have come across in recent months.  Like the film, the songs on this CD are masterfully crafted.  <br />I have noticed some reviews criticizing the quality of the recording.  CMT recently aired a special on the recording of this CD where the producers of the album stated that the quality of the recording was intentional.  They wanted to authentically capture the original feel of the era and the music.  In order to do so, they went to great lengths to recreate authentic depression-era sounds using authentic equipment.  To fully appreciate this CD one must also appreciate the sound of the recording just as much as the music itself.
B00003CY6M|4.0|John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale were wonderfully cast in this film. I only wish they had spent more time together because I did not think that their chemistry was fully realized in the short scenes they had opposite each other.<br />This is a fairly predictable romance which requires some suspension of belief, but it worked and left me feeling good....and that is just what I expected and wanted. Great cinematography and music added to my enjoyment.<br />I wish that the two main characters had been portrayed as being more  thoughtful about running away from their commitments...I was a bit uncomfortable with that.<br />Otherwise, it was a delightful hour and a half.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I don't usually do reviews since I'm not into writing soliloquies, but I feel I must say a few words about this DVD for those who have not seen this movie and are considering purchasing it.<br />Yes it is a good horror film in terms of lots of action, blood, and a good pace, although no surprise that Hannibal is going to get the bad guy (pretty gruesomly) in the end.  But the movie is so preoccupied with shocking you that is distracts itself from any meaninful plot/character development.  I bought this movie because I wanted to know more about Clarice and Hannibal and what I got was just gore.  In the original, the violence had a purpose but this sequel's purpose appears to really just be trying to one-up the shock value of blood &amp; guts in the original.<br />I actually felt ill after watching this movie, and I am not at all the squeamish type (I watch thriller/horror movies all the time).  To many, my saying that will just make them want to go out and watch/buy it.  Which is fine for people who want this kind of entertainment.  Myself, I go more for the thriller/mystery type and love how the original challenged our views of what we think of as &quot;barbaric&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; in our society.  Violence is okay if it has a purpose in driving the story.<br />If you're looking for more of the movie I was, you will NOT like this movie.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I've never been a big fan of spidey aka spiderman. But I knew I would love this movie, well me being compelled to anything with true and pure raw or unveiled emotions. It had good action I mean I haven't read the comics or really watched the cartoons, but my bro Bill has and he says they stayed quite true to the whole story line(course they did change some things to work for a movie and the web shooters, but I like the whole web coming right out of the wrist instead of those web shooter things better anyways.)<br /> But yeah...I *Love* it. I now most people wouldn't cry, but I did...In fact I've been crying alot today, I can totally sympathise with \\"Peter Parker\\" not being able to have the one he loves so much...I mean that really hurts, he could, but yet he can't. Of course if you've read the cmoics you'll know, but if you haven't then well you'll know when you see the movie. Definetely lives up to the hype in my opinion. There were deep emotional connections with each main character.  It was just so awesome. I heard their supposed to make 2 more, I dunno how they can top this one, but I'd love to see it done, or at least just as good!!! I don't want to see another \\"Mummy Returns\\"!!!<br /> But this movie was just awesome, just don't have to many expectations. I may have, but I could feel the movie before I saw it, I could kinda sense it. And it gave my emotions the kick-start they'de needed for a couple of weeks(With God's work I use my emotions alot).<br /> So I definetely recomend it. Its not just an action movie, its a very emotional film(In a good way!!!), thoughtfull, good strong charcters, and well its just plain good!!!<br />So *enjoy*, I honestly *HOPE* you will!!! Cause if you don't I pity you!!!<br />God Bless ~Amy<br />PS: Don't be suprized if you find yourself yelling or cheering in the movie, I did and so did some other people!! :D

B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE would have probably been a great Kubrick film had the great Stanley Kubrick lived to direct it, but in the fanciful and no less masterful hands of the great Steven Spielberg, it comes alive in a way that no other director would have been able to accomplish so well. Spielberg took Kubrick's vision and ran with it; the result is a melding of directorial genius from both sides: the technical brilliance of Stanley Kubrick fused with the dramatic brilliance of Steven Spielberg. <br />Haley Joel Osment, perhaps the most gifted young actor working today, stars as David, the first &quot;mecha&quot; boy to be built, and put up for adoption, so to speak. He is the proud creation of Professor Allen Hobby (a majestic William Hurt), and soon enters the lives of young parents Henry and Monica Swinton (Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor), who are grieving over their seemingly terminally ill son, Martin (Jake Thomas). Although the introductory phase begins rather awkwardly for Monica, as she tries teach David what not to do (such as follow her around everywhere), things actually go well--that is, until the young (and apparently quite mischievous) Martin miraculously recovers, and comes back home to find this puzzling cyber-boy who wants only to be his friend. However, Martin has other things in mind, and upsetting the delicate balance of attention that exists in the home is one of them. Things progress from here, and the story takes off in unexpected new directions, involving a &quot;Pleasure Mecha&quot; named Gigolo Joe (quirkily played by an unusually effervescent Jude Law) who is inadvertently thrust into the responsibility of guiding David to the next step he must take in his journey. <br />I will not expound on this story any further; besides, this film is not simply about what happens. It's more about feeling and emotional balance, not an easy theme for a story dealing with a cyborg as the central character. It's also about the journey of life, andwhat it means for one whom, biologically speaking, has no life. In this way it differs from an earlier film about a robot boy, called D.A.R.Y.L. That film also told an interesting story; however, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (whose rather cumbersome title should have been left at AI, which was its original working title) does not unfold from a person's point of view. <br />Do not expect a lot of action when you see this film, as it explores various philosophical concepts that transcend what it actually shows on the screen. What you can expect is a film that is both futuristic and lyrical in nature, has a story to tell, and is completely enrapturing in its ability to blend it all into an original mix that dares to make you think and wonder. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005JKCF|5.0|First off let me say what a fantastic movie this is. Spiderman has it all, action, humor, and wonderful special effects. Lets face it, something for everyone.<br />Peter Parker is your typical geeky high schooler who has a crush on a popular girl at school.  Ofcrouse, the super jock also likes her, and wants to make Peter's life miserable.  Then one day, Peter's life changes when he's bitten by a special spider.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br />The casting was perfect. Defoe is wonderful as the Green Goblin. He has the perfect mannerism for a bad guy. Kirsten Dunst as MJ was wonderful, full of sweet and innocence. Ofcourse, Toby is perfect for Spiderman.<br />What I liked about this movie is that the lesson that Peter learns. I can't way what it is, ofcourse, because I don't want to ruin it, but the lesson is well learned.<br />I highly suggest you go see this movie. Stay for the credits b/c at the end of the movies (and after most of the songs at the end) they play the \\"Spiderman song\\" from the cartoon. It was a cute touch.
B00005JKJA|1.0|This movie was terribly long, interesting at times, but overall very ridiculous.  I watched this with a few highly educated friends.  We watched this movie, discussed it and dismissed as a pile of incoherent drivel!  The acting was extremely well done, unfortunately there was really nothing to do.  Save the 2  hours of your life and do something constructive.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Before I saw Gosford Park, many people kept telling me how complicated it got and that it was simply impossible to follow. I walked into the theater promising myself I would not be confused or at all dazed by this movie...I found it not to be a difficult goal to set. This movie had a large cast of characters, but was beautifully set up, leaving us with clear-cut suspects, reasons and times in which they would have killed the victim. But the murder is not even the beginning of the intricate plot, there are relationships between people that appear to be one thing, but turn to be totally different. As the truth was slowly revealed to us audience members, there was more than one *gasp*. The best kind of mystery, is that which sets things up so well and clearly that theoretically you could figure it out on your own, but don't until they want you to. Gosford Park is by far one of the best movies of 2001, and one of the most enjoyable murder mysteries I have seen. <br />The acting, direction, costuming, sets, script...everything are flawless. I highly recommend it.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I'm an old school spidey fan and I just saw the movie.  I came out of it with a stupid grin on my face and it's still on as I write this.  The movie lived up to all the hype and exceeded my expectations. Go see the film, you won't be disappointed. It has all of the touches that only Marvel could reproduce.  I'm so glad they stayed true to the characters and dimensions of Spidey's personality.  the poses and flight scenes were fantastic.  I haven't gone back to see a film in a long, long time, but I think I might sneak back to the theatre to see this one again.  enjoy!!!
B00005Y228|5.0|This is the only CD that I own by Kylie Minogue so I can't really compare it to her others but from what I can hear this FEVER is burning hot. From the opening groove of \\"More More More\\" to the last more techno sounding \\"Butterfly\\" this CD is guaranteed to blow your mind.<br />About 15 years ago Kylie broke out in the US with her hit cover of \\"Locomotion\\", thereafter exploding with continuous chart toppers in the UK. Until recently nobody could remember who Kylie was until the huge radio single \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" came out and did just that. I remember when that song first came out and everyone was humming to it. Its died down now but I hope that she can continue to dominate the pop charts because she really does deserve that type of fame. She's so much more talented than Britney Spears who sounds like a chipmunk when she sings and I think that its time that we recognize that and hand her her rightful crown. With sweeping ballads like \\"Fragile\\" and potential chart toppers like \\"Come Into My World\\" (which will probably be her next single) and \\"Love Affair\\" (which pumps with rhythmic techno) this is destined to become one of the best dance albums ever made. In my own opinion every song here is a potential hit but others that standout from the rest include the r&b spiced \\"Boy\\" (which is one of two hidden tracks only found on the US release) and the funky \\"Burning Up\\" with its infectuous disco beats. So if you like electronic groups like Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx with fun dance-pop (not to mention catchy choruses) than Kylie Minogue's FEVER is the perfect album to light your fire with.<br />This is pure ear candy and it's highly recommended.
0375703861|3.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this book for the most part.  I found it a really comfortable read and quite comical at points.  However, it seemed to have a lot of careless editorial mistakes that kept distracting me.  At one point, I am pretty sure she gets the twins confused and some of the dialogue didn't fit so well with the time period the story was supposed to be taking place in.  Again though, I think these errors have to do with inexperience, (although I imagine the editor had slightly more, what went wrong?)<br />I also thought the ending was really weak, I loved the way she built up the characters and the action, but it all seemed to kind of flop around at the end. <br />Worth reading and I look forward to more in the future...
6305750750|3.0|Great fun, fantastic pod race, one of the best light saber battles, JAR JAR BINKS MUST DIE!!! When is episodes 4-6 coming out on DVD?
0316920045|5.0|Yes, that is the title of Dave Eggers' new novel...but it so accurately describes this opus by David Foster Wallace. This is the sort of novel authors build a career on...and this is destined to be a classic of modern (or hyper-modern) fiction.<br />Make of that hyperbole what you will.<br />But Wallace has taken a series of intricately detailed plots (and there are several plots going here)and sub-plots and situated them in an often surreal, not-too-distant American future...aliented and bored; an America that takes itself way too seriously. Out of these, Wallace conjures up a series of themes touching on media, entertainment, terrorism, disfunctionality, and addiction.<br />While this makes for some difficult reading at times, what with flipping for footnotes, trying to figure out dates (the naming rights for years have been marketed to corporations), and keeping track of characters and clues...it's nonetheless masterful that Wallace still tells a number of compelling stories.<br />The major plot lines revolve around a tennis academy, an adjoining half way house for the addicted, and the use by a Quebec nationalist group of a terrorist weapon, a video cassette known as the Entertainment: a mysterious film that acts as a narcotic on those who watch it...in effect, leaving its victims in a catatonic state.  The Entertainment is an obvious metaphor of the narcotizing effect of modern media.<br />Wallace could have easily left Infinite Jest as a mere science fiction parable on modern media.  Fortunately, he didn't.<br />Sometimes the lines created by the many sub-plots and themes in Infinite Jest cross.  Often they don't.  In either event, these threads more often than not leave behind a series of questions that Wallace often leaves dangling (or does he? Perhaps the answers are in the footnotes!).  But the unanswered questions and unresolved issues are often as telling about Wallace's intentions than those few instances where the reader is spoon fed the answer.<br />It's a lot of work to go into a lot of detail about a novel this big and complicated. If you didn't like \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" or \\"Women and Men\\" or \\"The Recognitions\\"....you probably won't like this anyway. But if you have a soft spot for big, crooked novels like this....it will drag you in.<br />And ultimately, what drags you into \\"Infinite Jest\\" is the author's empathy for some of his characters. It's expressed throughout this novel as sadness....this novel is indeed heartbreaking in it's description of those desperates in 12-step programs, the degradation caused by addiction, the sick disfunctionality of modern family life.<br />Perhaps what's saddest is Wallace's dark view on where we're headed.<br />Even those moments of hilarity in this book, and there are many, are tinged with a sadness that makes any humor that much more bittersweet,even though the reader is laughing out loud...maybe what makes these particularly poignant, is that perhaps we're laughing at the hopelessness of the all-encompassing blues that has pervaded Wallace's fictional society. In Wallace's world, sometimes that's the only possible response.<br />If not the only one.
B00005QW5X|5.0|The two best movies of the year in my opinion were \\"Memento\\" and \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\". Niether one was nominated for best picture (and yet Moulin Rouge was, go figure). The DVD for Hedwig is sensational, with a wonderful Comentary by John Cameron Mitchel, and a sensational documentary on the history of the film. The soundtrack has some of the best kick-[rear] rock you'll ever hear, and OH! By the way, ACADAMY, HOW DO YOU NOT NOMINATE \\"THE ORIGIN OF LOVE\\" FOR BEST SONG?!!!
B000006045|5.0|This is music for your dark side, and it feels soooo good.  I listened to this CD three times a day during a divorce period I went through a few years ago.  It was a time when I didn't want to hear any of the happy mush you get from the likes of Brittany Spears, or even edgier stuff like Blink182.  I wanted to be alone in my misery, and this music delivered.  Ironically, its dark, grungy guitar and haunting lyrics helped me through that tough time.  It's not a compilation suited for summer afternoon drives through the countryside.  It IS a CD to hear while you're driving through the back alleys and neon-lit urban jungles...at night...with the radio cranked.  On this release in particular, Massive Attack is masterful at exploring music that invokes the dark misery we all strive to avoid but must confront once in awhile. Strangly therapeutic, indeed.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Still one of the funniest films ever made, this special edition DVD just adds to the Hillarity. I laughed for 10 minutes straight after clicking on \\"The Hard of Hearing\\" portion af disc one's menu. Disc two also have some very funny bits. Michael Palin as the Minister of food explaining what you can do with coconuts. Terry Jones giving directions for the Gregorian Chant sing-a-long, the Knights of the Round Table singing and dancing in leggo not to mention several commentaries from the Python troup themselves. BUY THIS ONE!!!
B00005AXEL|5.0|The white witch of rock is back with her seventh solo album and is on top again!  The songs on Trouble in Shangri La prove that Stevie Nicks is as relevant to rock music today as she was nearly thirty years ago.  Her music reflects her depth of emotion and vast experience as a rock performer.  It's debut at #5 on Billboard is proof that she is still the Queen of Rock n' Roll.  <br />Best picks on the album are &quot;Trouble in Shangri La&quot; &quot;I Miss You&quot; and &quot;Love Is&quot;.  Don't miss the hits &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;!
B00000AOUD|5.0|I decided to take a break from Beatles and review other albums. This one, I think, is a pure masterpiece. Sure, it may have started the whole 40-60 minute compsitions, but this one feels like it rushed by. I love the diffrent styles of music on this. Folk, metal, classical, and jazz combined into this big opus. Also, there's some weird drum solos and noise parts. (Check out the QUOTE part.) There's a symphony in the 2nd side, but unfortuantly, that's for about 15 seconds. Ian also shows off his brilliant flute skill. He also plays acoustic guitar and saxaphone. This song is fantastic. A real keeper.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter is so cool.Why? Because the books are tottaly the best of all of the books I've ever read!! And you don't even want to think of all the books I read. OOH! Sorry, got off the subject! I am impressed about how good the movies were, but they missed tons of things!! Like, the troll was so obviously fake!! But who am I to critique?? I think the movie makers did a good job. If you read this please and know when the 5th Harry Potter book is coming out write a review and I'll try to find it, Thanks, BYE.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy is truly an extraordinary cd, definitely Pearl Jam's best. Compared to Ten and Vs, Vitalogy fearlessly moves to some completely different grounds, and it works!!!!<br />All songs are precisely polished, Eddie's voice is more magnificent than ever before or since...<br />Dark, moody, contemplative songs like Tremor Christ, Nothingman, or Immortality,  excell both lyrically and melodicaly. The experimentation on the sound level in Bugs may be a little overdone, but the song's shocking words leave a definite message that will make you reconsider some crucial existencial stuff in your life...<br /> It also needs to be said that because of its distinctive sound marked with some decent experimentation, this might not be the right Pearl Jam cd to start with, but it is certainly the best of what Vedder & Co. have produced so far. If you already own some PJ stuff, this cd should definitely not be missing in your collection!
B00005JKMQ|4.0|Mohammed Ali is bigger than life and portraying him in a movie is a daunting task.  Will Smith probably comes as close to looking, sounding and acting like Ali as a person could, but there is always a sense that the movie falls a little short of catching the essence of the man.  Events in Ali's life unfold in the movie, but there is never much depth of explanation about why things happened as they did.  John Voight is superb as Howard Coselle and the movie paints a close relationship between Cosell and Ali which is belied by the verbal barbs they always shot at each other on tv.  There are so many important events in Ali's life that if must have been a nightmare deciding what to include.  Although it has a 2 1/2 hour running time, the movie seems to end rather abruptly.  Despite its flaws, Ali is an entertaining film and does hold the viewer's attention.
038533558X|5.0|I was very upset over the news of Harlan Coben's decision to temporarily shelve the Bolitar series.  They were the best of its kind.  Two steps above the Parker Spencer series.  But all was forgiven after I had read Tell No One.  A book the I personally bought 5 copies of just to give to friends. This was simply the best mystery I have every read.  Until now.  I have just finished Gone for Good; please don't make the mistake of thinking the last few pages of the book just ties up loose ends.  From start to finish this book rocks.  No longer is Tell No One the best mystery I have ever read, its now second best to Gone for Good.  The only problem is I now have to buy a bunch of additional copies for my friends, so they too can read the best mystery author of our times.
B000002OZY|5.0|I remember how I was blown away the first time I listened to Tommy, and I have not changed my perspective on this brilliant rock opera.  From John Entwistle's opening horn notes on the Overture to Roger Daltrey's final plea to \\"See me, feel me, touch me, heal me\\" on \\"We're Not Gonna Take It,\\" the listener is mesmerized.  The gorgeous, melodramatic overture is a breathtaking introduction, and starting with \\"It's A Boy,\\" The Who deliver a succession of excellent songs, letting the plot unfold.  <br />For whatever reason, The Who produced their best work when doing rock operas (ex ref Quadrophenia).   Perhaps to some extent it was because elaborate lyrics inspired great music.  The lyrics to the two truly great tracks, \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"We're Not Gonna Take It,\\" are superb and very imaginative, and along with \\"I'm Free\\" these songs fittingly became pop hits.  As great a group as The Who is, these two songs amount to almost their best ever, and there are so many other standouts, including \\"Sensation\\" as well as two acoustic-guitar-laden numbers, \\"Sally Simpson\\" and the instrumental \\"Underture.\\"<br />But the most telling point is the talent for a theatrical and dramatic style with which the group is endowed.  The dynamics of The Who's sound lent itself to the rock opera genre, which Pete Townshend essentially created with the mini-opera \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" in 1966.  On Tommy, Keith Moon's symphonic percussion style, which ranges from thunderous bass barrages to sublime cymbal accents; Entwistle's French Horn fills and bass playing dexterity; Daltrey's inspired vocals; and Townshend's innovative acoustic and electric guitar are the ingredients to one of rock's masterpieces.  Remarkably, The Who took Tommy to even greater heights in their live performances.
0553106635|5.0|1) This is, BY FAR, the best fantasy I have ever read. Ever. Better than Donaldson, Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, better than everyone.<br />2)This is, BY FAR, the best characterization I've ever come across in the fantasy genre. Never in my life have I at so many different times over the course of the three books written been so amazed (Daenerys from the fire, obtaining the Unsullied, choosing between the {better?} of two betrayels) stunned (Catelyn, Ser Barristan Selmy) grief-stricken (from deaths of beloved characters, of course only to realize by the end of the next chapter there are so many fantastic characters left). And of course these are just a few examples, there are so many more but don't want to mention at the risk of spoiling new readers.<br />Yes -- amazed, stunned, saddened. I spontaneously and literally yelled, gasped, cried, and cheered while reading these books. Never have I been so emotionally invested in such a large cast of characters. Memories of these books bring forth emotion in me even now, a month after I read this, his latest book.<br />3)Fabulously intricate plotting. I find it interesting that a common thread in the slightly more negative reviews of this book find Martin a bit ponderous -- that there's so much writing with not alot of action. This couldn't be further from the truth!<br />Yes, this is high, epic, cruel fantasy of the tallest order. Yes, this is a tall read for younger readers, or those weaned on Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, etc. But there literally isn't a SINGLE CHAPTER in any of his books where some part of the plot isn't advanced in some way -- spanning over 2000 pages of hardcover text. That's how good the writing is.<br />4)Deftly understated magic. I remember reading the first book thinking to myself, 'where's the magic? isn't this supposed to be fantasy?' And I kept reading, still finding almost no magic. The only real magic from the first book I can remember bookends the first book. I will never forget the birth of the Unburnt at the very end of the first novel. I'm gasping right now as I recall it. Such a POWERFUL moment. And there was some magic there. And the fact that my senses hadn't been already been dulled by the overdone, contrived use of magic found in so many other fantasy novels allowed me to feel the real impact of what Dany accomplished at the end of that first novel. Magic means so much more in these novels because at least over these the first three books, there is so little to be found.<br />5)Spectacular dialogue. This is the best dialogue I've ever read. Razorsharp wit, acid tongues, stoic nobility, prideful revenge, hungry vengeance, soul-baring sadness, and so many other wonderful emotions conveyed by superior dialogue. If this review weren't so long, I'd quote a few passages. I just remember reading some of those Lannister exchanges saying to myself 'you go! oh yeah! perfect!&quot; I remember laughing out loud at some of the things said, not so much because they were humorous (although some of them were) but because so often the pointed words exchanged felt more like the point of a rapier twisting through the ribcage into the recipient's heart. It's just that good. So consistently good.<br />6)Anyone remember Thomas Covenant? One of the great anti-heroes in fantasy. You rooted for him and hated him. You knew he was the good guy, but you were never quite comfortable enough with who he was to cheer him on without reservation.<br />Well, many characters like him, not just one, populate Martin's books. As soon as you think you've found the bad guy, you begin to root for him as well. And you wonder, as you go from chapter to chapter, how you can find yourself rooting for almost every character in the book? Well, that's just one of the many great things about Martin's books.  Practically every character is an anti-heroe and how a book can be so riveting with (at this point) no clear villain is a testimonial for the great characterization in these books.<br />People,I'm not kidding. This is the best out there. If Martin pulls off this series it will far and away be the best epic fantasy ever written. It already is, I'm just praying it's sustained. Yes, it's better than Tolkien, but only in the way that The Godfather was better than the old great silent pictures of the early 20th century. I regard Tolkien's work with great reverance, and it's wonderful to see the foundations of the fantasy genre brought to the big screen, but Martin is taking the genre to new heights. He truly is.<br />For me, I knew at least the first book was special early on. If you can... sense something... if yours eyes open just a bit, if your curiosity is peaked... if you're thinking 'hmmm'.... as the first chapter closes with the discovery of the Direwolves, then you'll be tasting just a hint of the wonderment Martin's books can give you.<br />Just try not to be too sad when you've finished and realize there may not be anything this good for a long, long time to come.ople, I'm not kidding.

B00005JKCF|5.0|I actually got to see Spider-Man on May 3rd! In Japan it is highly unusual for a movie to come out on the same date as in America, there's unusually at least a 3 month wait. But surprisingly, I was able to see \\"Spider-Man\\" on May 3rd by getting reserved tickets! And I must say, the movie was so much better than I expected (and I had expected a lot!)<br />High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is while very smart is the school freak. His only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), son of scientist Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe). He is also very much in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) though he won't approach her. So he goes through life ignored and made fun of. But Peter's life is about to be turned upside down when at a high school excursion to the museum he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super spider. At first thinking none of it, he goes back home where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). But the next day, he wakes up to find himself with perfect vision and also a more muscular body! Stranger things happen in school where he finally realizes that the bite he got has given him special abilities which spiders have, from amazing agility, strength, extraordinary senses, and web flinging powers. He soon finds out though that with his new powers comes great responsibility. Norman Osborne has got a split personality, the other side of him being the evil Green Goblin. Peter knows that someone has to stop him... could that someone be 'Spider-Man'?<br />I must say that \\"Spider-Man\\" has got it all! *ACTING*: Kirsten Dunst is very believable as the not-so-perfect Mary Jane with her family and love problems. You can't help but feel for her character. Then there's Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/Green Goblin. His scene where he confronts 'himself' in the mirror was remarkably well down, it takes an enormous amount of talent to be able to portray two different personalities like that. And I mustn't forget Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. He can show his expressions so well, from his shy smile to Mary Jane, his turmoil of grief, his determination to stop Green Goblin, and his excitement when he first tries out his superpowers. You can't help but become attached to his character. Though I have never read any of the Spider-Man comics, my father has and he was so delighted to find that the editor of the newspaper seemed to be right out of the comic book, from his looks to his attitude.<br />*PLOT*: Intriguing plot, making the two hours of the movie seem to flick by so fast. The story has plenty of surprises and twists, making the whole entire time very enjoyable. The first thirty minutes or so was very light, I was laughing a lot on the mishaps of Peter Parker's previous life to becoming Spider-Man. But from then on it became a little bit more serious, the ending climaxing to explosion of action and excitement! The end might put off some people but I found it highly satisfying. I can't tell what happens but I must say that the end definitely calls for a sequel! As for the humor and seriousness of the film, I always believe that most all movies should have the right balance of these two points. And Spider-Man was great, having plenty of humor to keep my laughing yet a serious tone to it which was essential to the movie.<br />*ACTION AND F/X*: The action is so well done that through the last hour or so of the movie I was on the edge of my seat! All of the confrontations of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were very exciting, the last 'battle' (as there usual is) the most tense. As in the trailers, Spider-Man does not only get to fly and fling himself through the air, he also gets to do a lot of hand-to-hand fighting and kung-fu. Applause to the fight coordinator. The F/X were pretty real yet had a sort of comic book feel to it making it very easy to watch and enjoy. Watch Spider-Man fly through the air, send out webs, twist in the air in what seems like impossible moves,and fight evil with the agility of... well you know, a spider!<br />*PG-13 RATING*: The film is rated PG-13 for 'stylized action and violence' but I think think there should be added 'and for some language'.<br />So my conclusion is, \\"Spider-Man\\" is a GREAT film and I most definitely will be getting the DVD as soon as it comes out! Maybe see it in the theaters a few more times :-). I also recommend two other super-hero movies which are my favorites, \\"Superman\\" with Christopher Reeve and \\"The Shadow\\" with Alec Baldwin. \\"Batman\\" was also interesting though it didn't make much of an impression on me.
B000000186|5.0|Quite simply, this album is a positively delicious collection of some of the finest melodically-based rock tunes ever written!  Clearly, this was Badfinger at their best, and how I would like to remember this fabulous band which unfortunately never had the opportunity to have much of their best music heard by a larger audience.  From top to bottom, the tracks are consistently strong, original-sounding, never repetitive, and the songs have aged remarkably well in the 30-plus years since their original release.  Produced slickly and professionally first by the late great George Harrison (before he became involved with the Concert For Bangladesh)and later by Todd Rundgren who nonetheless do not fail to capture the classic gritty Badfinger sound.  In terms of songwriting, it is a particularly strong album for band members Joey Molland (\\"Suitcase\\", \\"Sweet Tuesday Morning\\") and Pete Ham (\\"Take It All\\", \\"Baby Blue\\", \\"Name of the Game\\", \\"Day After Day\\", \\"Perfection\\") and it is frightening to think about how good this band was and could have been had they had the proper time to develop and support from their labels and management.  Pete Ham in particular was an amazing musician and songwriter, an unrecognized legend-in-making who deserves to be recognized along with the greatest in rock history but sadly probably never will get his just due while overrated hacks are fawned over by the music industry each decade.  His songs have the rare ability to entertain and emotionally captivate simultaneously and there is a certain beautiful pathos which comes across from his lyrics that makes one recognize what a special and tragically vulnerable person he was, especially poignant considering he would take his own life 5 years after this album's release.  After the 12 songs from the original release, there are 6 bonus tracks that are just about the most enjoyable and interesting such tracks ever on an album- throwaways designed to jack up the price they most certainly are not!  These include 5 earlier-recorded incarnations of album songs highlighted by a fabulous, completely different acoustic-guitar based version of \\"Name of the Game\\" (this is the version on The Very Best of Badfinger Greatest Hits album recently released; the album version is a slower, piano-based, more full-sounding version) and the original version of \\"Suitcase\\" which is musically grittier and more biting, in many ways a better match musically for the song's caustic lyrics and containing the original lyrics before they were modified to eliminate a drug reference.  All in all, a must-have for any fan of great songwriting and rock music and a wonderful sonic legacy for this lost treasure of a band.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I haven't heard the whole album, but I've heard 8 songs out of the twelve by downloading them. There all good, except I'm A Slave 4 U is getting annoying now! My favourite songs that I've heard are: Not A Girl Not Yet A Women(slow song, great job Britney), I Love Rock & Roll(hardest song I've heard, well done), Cinderella(especially this one), Lonely(fast paced, really well done) and Boys(is pretty good). Overall, out of the 8, it's probably the best 8 songs I've heard from, excluding Stronger. I definetely recommend this from what I've heard, and hey, even if the other 4 aren't good, that's still getting your money's worth. I've heard plenty of worse albums, trust me! Way to go Britney, TWO THUMBS UP! Her BEST so far! Be sure to catch Britney in Crossroads, also TWO THUMBS UP!
B00005JKCF|4.0|I have just seen the movie Spider-man and came away impressed. First, there are many things to like about this movie. Tobey nailed Peter Parker and Spidey(would have liked to see a little more of his trademark sarcasm when in costume though). Dafoe was perfect for the Goblin and all of the cast nailed the dominant personality traits of their characters as they are portrayed in the comic. The scenes of web-slinging were the best. Childhood fantasy put on film. It was great to see all the little kids walk out of the theatre pretending to shoot webs. <BR>     The hardest part for them to do must have been the costume. They hit that one perfect also. The goblin costume was less than perfect, but I guess the alternative was a rubber mask(or a tranformation ala' Dr. Jeckyll?) They strayed from the comic on some issues, but going in you knew they would. The obvious one is the web shooter. Another is the contaminated spider itself. I understand the sacrifice of the web story for the sake of brevity and believability, but the irradiated spider story would still work.<BR>       Things I didn't like( also known as nit picking). Macy Gray? If it was on T.V at that point, I would has changed the channel. Kirsten Dunst. She could be a super criminal. Butterface. Also time to get somebody new to do the musical score. Elfman made the intro and music too similiar to Batman. Spiderman is young, hip and hopeful, not dark and brooding. He made himself sound like a one trick pony. <br />Kudos to Sam Raimi!! I'm out.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I LOVE movies. I go to the movies almost every weekend and as a big movie go-er, I say that the Harry Potter movie was absolutely amazing. The directing and special effects were fantastic. They didn't make the movie to fit the imagination of every Harry Potter reader, they made it to tell the fictional story of Harry Potter and that is exactly what they acomplished. They got actors who I think fit the roles exactly (maybe not their appearance was exactly how your brain imagined them) but overall their personalities were very similar. I advise anyone who hasn't seen the movie to go out asap and see it, if they have read the books or not. I've seen the movie three times already and read the books twice (reading them again at the moment) and I am buying the DVD because I know I will watch it over and over and over and not get sick of it because it's that good. I hope someone knows what I am talking about. Anyways, I defninitely recommend the Harry Potter movie, and I can't wait for others to come!
B00005V9L1|5.0|I can say, without feeling blasphemous, that this movie is on par with my personal favorite movie ever, Fight Club. The story is wonderful. The performances of Gyllenhaal (brother, as well as sister) are great. The fact that the ending leaves the movie up to interpretation is great as well. Sometimes I'd rather think about what happened and derive my own conclusions rather than have everything spelled out for me. Anyway, if you're into the weird as well as the thought-provoking, give this a try. At the very least you'll be entertained.
0385721234|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\".  The author was Talking About old family traditions,love, false morality and betrayal.  Also what made it more interesting was the recipies <BR>that were included in every chapter. I have not tried the recipies yet, but it sounds very tempting and easy to make. <BR>Maybe I'll try them on my family.       <br />                                              Laura Rendon
B0000636UN|4.0|With the exception of her sophomore effort, Sheryl Crow's records are more often that not distinguished by some strong singles('Leaving Las Vegas','My Favorite Mistake'), with the rest filled out by largely average material. C'MON C'MON finds her improving greatly on the vastly overrated THE GLOBE SESSIONS,padding the set with more hooks than any of her previous records,and rocking with abandon on many of its' tracks.  First single 'Soak Up The Sun', though fairly catchy, offers up her most meaningless lyrics since 'All I Wanna Do'--Crow showcases herself to far better effect on such tracks as 'You're An Original','Hole In My Pocket', and the albums' best cut 'Lucky Kid'.  Much like Stevie Nicks' recent album, Crow also brings in a ton of guest vocalists, with only Don Henley making any real mark on the sappy ballad 'It's So Easy'.  Nevertheless, this stands as Crow's most consistent set next to her second effort.
B0000636UN|5.0|I'll leave the detailed reviews to others and just say:<br />1.  This is an Album of the Year finalist and a sure bet for winner.<br />2.  Sheryl Crow is one of the most talented and gifted musicians and songwriters on the face of the planet - period.<br />This CD is terrific from beginning to end.  Don't believe a word you read on some of these other reviews that call this album labored and uninspired.  Those people are on something.  Get this CD and formulate your own opinion.  You will not be let down, and will in fact not take the CD out of your player for months...
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is not as much Sam Raimi's movie, nor Tobey Maguire's nor Kirsten Dunst's as it is a movie embodying the spirits of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko - the guys who created Spidey in the first place.<br />A surprise is this film is actually quite complex when it comes to human emotions and motivations.  No one does anything without some reason (or something they truly believe is a reason), and in Spider-Man each person has their own set of complexity.  The acting is excellent, particularly the scenes between Maguire and Dunst.  J.K. Simmons as 'Daily Bugle' (the Flatiron Building) editor J. Jonah Jameson is truly terrifying in a bad-boss way.  All the usual suspects are present; the bullying jock, the girl next door, and Aunt May.  There is humor, and in a display of skill this humor grows naturally out of the situations, and does not feel forced.<br />The action sequences are dynamic - to say the least.  Lee and Ditko imagined Spidey web-swinging across New York City at great speed.  They must be delighted in seeing Maguire (who did at least some of his own stunts) bring Spidey's speed and agility to the screen.<br />Some may complain that parts of the film are slow (like the lead-up to the infamous spider-bite), but taken in the context that Spider-Man 2 and 3 are already in the works, we may well look back on the 'slow' scenes as a good place to catch one's breath.  The only true problem is the Green Goblin mask.  (I hated it in the spy photos, thru production, and especially right up there on the screen.)  Other than that mask, this is a film that rocks hard and fast any time someone in costume is on screen, and seethes with intrigue when the characters are in mufti.<br />All in all, an excellently realised film.  Some very young viewers may be startled by the action sequences.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I saw the film yesterday and was very impressed...and VERY entertained.<br />While there were a few predictable scenes, they did not detract from the overall enjoyment.  The entire \\"How Peter Parker became Spider Man\\" story worked very well and was extremely effective.  The cast was great and I'm sure this movie will make a lot of money.  Unlike last years \\"Summer Blockbusters\\", this movie deserves every cent it makes.<br />A great start to what I'm sure will be a great franchise.
B00003CXI1|5.0|At first I was reluctant to see this movie because I didn't want to ruin the books.  I decided to see it anyways in the small hope that it might be good.  I am so glad I saw it!!!  This movie is completly true to the book.  Besides a few minor details at the end it was almost exactly like the book.  The director obviously relized the importance of not changing the movie from the book...  This movie stays interesting all the way to the last scene.  If your a Harry Potter fan than you should definetly see this movie!!!
6303567126|2.0|The performances in this film, particularly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg are pretty good, but the film suffers from an unrefined script and mediocre direction.  What in this film have we not seen before in other films?  Certainly not the good guy whose life is ruined by drugs.  What about the tough-love mom?  Nope, seen that before.  Redemption at the end?  That's a given.<br />I finished \\"Basketball Diaries\\" with no new insights into drugs, life, or death.  Lorraine Bracco's character as Jim's mother is horribly underwritten, and whenever she does appear, she's yelling or crying.  Her character should have been fleshed out.  And a basketball game during a rainy night after the funeral of one of Jim's best friends is supposed to be poignant, but is not particularly emotional because the friend dies almost immediately after the film introduces him.<br />The only reason to see this film is Leonardo DiCaprio's acting.  He is a good actor, but he can't save this film.  ...
0141301066|5.0|...have been fond of Roald Dahl ever since I read \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" in second grade, but I never got around to reading Matilda until now. This is a fantastic book, and is easily one of Dahl's best, with his trademark loveable, oddball characters and sense of invention and wonder...what startled me most about this book was that Dahl included some very mature themes in the final few chapters. Without giving away any plot twists (and believe me, there are some good ones here), the issue of child abuse is brought up. The characters don't dwell on it, but for a mature reader like myself who has seen children's entertainment deteriorate into mindless, sugar-coated garbage, it's refreshing to see such things mentioned. Young children will realize the seriousness of what is being said but won't be overtaken by it, which seems like the ideal way to make them aware of these issues. Thank you, Mr. Dahl, for reminding us of a time when children's stories could be both fun and meaningful.<br />On a lighter note, I'm getting more used to Quentin Blake's new illustrations. While I'd still prefer to see copies of Dahl's novels with their original drawings, Blake's style fits Matilda quite well, and even gives Miss Honey her due and makes her really pretty.<br />All in all, Matilda is a book for everyone, and adults will enjoy reading this book to their children.
B00004Z459|5.0|10+ stars!  This is the best CD to come out in years!  I was starting to worry that the 90s and 2000s would be full of one hit wonders and boy bands.  I bought this CD to listen to on a road trip and I found myself leaving it in the CD player the ENTIRE trip.  Never before have I let a CD play 7 times and I still wanted more!  This mix of heavy metal and hip-hop is innovative and intense, in both lyrics, composition, and sound.  I cannot wait to see what this band does in the future.  I truly believe this will be the next music genre!  You MUST get this CD!!  I cannot believe people are selling it used!
0871137380|4.0|I read the book, then saw the movie, and liked them both, if 'like' is a word for such punishment.  But, the book does not set out to provide escapist fare, nor to amuse.  The book is stark and balanced.  I raises far more questions than it answers, and they are questions we need to ponder.<br />This is not the book for those who are hooked on superheroes that never get hurt.  This book hurts.<br />But anyone who is willing to think a little about what it means to put lives on the line should read this book.  It justly deserves all the praise it has received.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I freely admit that I am one of those long time Uncle Tupelo fans for whom Jeff Tweedy and Wilco's abrupt turn away from roots music has not been especially palatable.  That said, even on it's own merits \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is a strange album.  Noticable right from the first track are all the goofy special effects and strange noises that serve primarily to clutter up the band's sound.  It's as if Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor was brought in to do the production work.  Particularly weird in the album's closing song, \\"Reservations,\\" which starts and stops and at one point features a distant feamle voice reciting the album's title over and over.  This is about as far from the old Uncle Tupelo (or even Wilco's own debut album \\"A.M.\\") as you can get.  Even the more conventional songs, like the catchy \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" \\"Kamera\\" and \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You,\\" seem off kilter.<br />Overall, Jeff Tweedy and his band should be commended for defying expectations and blazing their own trail.  What is uncertain, however, is just how many of their old fans will continue to go along with them.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I had my doubts about this movie but I was surprised by how good it actually is. Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker. I like the way the movie takes it's time in letting the audience get to know Peter and how he's a nerd at school, his feelings for MJ, and how he gets and develops his powers. It's not like in \\"X-Men\\" where all the sudden you have 7 different characters on the screen and you have to learn all their names, powers and attitudes all at once. \\"Spider-man\\" has great character development in it. Great special effects too. It's a little cartoony but perfect for a comic book movie. The first time Peter crawls on a wall is REALLY cool! The only let down in this movie is the Green Goblin. He's a real drag. You just can't wait for them to cut away for more Spider-man scenes. The Goblin is boring. He looks stupid too. The Green Goblin does not look anything like that in the comics. He looks like a Power Ranger villain in this. He's just stupid. Magneto in \\"X-Men\\" was a FAR greater villain. But I LOVED this movie just for Spider-man alone.
B000002J03|4.0|My previous interests in rock music have been the more indie-rock bands from Britain like Stereophonics, Supergrass, Radiohead and American stuff like BRMC and Chili Peppers. I was always told by my father to listen to stuff from his era like Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bad Company and the Stones. It was listening to some of these on VH1classic rock that urged me into buying some of the stuff. Two songs which stood out were Bad Company's &quot;good lovin' gone bad&quot; and Zep's &quot;Dazed and confused&quot;. I was told that Zep' II was the definitive lp so that's the one I got first. It didn't dissappoint. I have since purchased I and the untitled fourth (and have a tattoo on my arm of the four symbols). I wouldn't say this was the definitive lp by Zep' because I think they are the kind of band you need to hear more of than try to catagorize them on the strength of one lp. It is certainly a bloody good album though and rarely leaves my changer to go back in it's case. I gave the album four stars but I really give it four and a half. Great band, Great album.
6304602901|5.0|i love the police academy movies. michael winslow wasnt in mission to moiscow though. where was he. i love his style of comedy. its all sound effects.  steve guttenberg , kim catrall , and the guy who played tackleberry are my faves though.
6305603847|1.0|Why would somebody make a movie covering most of Pink Floyd's songs? Why can't we be allowed to visualize our own thoughts about a song? Yes, a 4 min music video is just fine, but to watch a 1,5 hour musicvideo is way too much for me.<br />No, buy a CD instead, the DVD technolegy is a wonderful thing, but this DVD is a waste of money. Buy an audio CD instead.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Jennifer Lopez is great in this movie. She IS the wedding planner! She thinks of everything!! If only HER life was as easy to plan. &quot;Dr. Steve&quot; is also great, who wouldn't want to marry him? Anyone who is afraid to watch this movie because of J-lo, don't be. She is a fine actress as well as a fine singer. Rent or buy it today!!
B00005OCMR|5.0|Great quality, great price.  Necessary for any Scifi geek's library.   There's not as much interview with Boxleitner as I expected, but the Director commentary and the deleted love scene are definitely great to have if you enjoyed the movie the first time around.   Also a wonderful look at the beginnings of computer animation, and the company behind Tron.
B00005JKCF|5.0|As I grew up I was a fan of Super Man and Spider Man comic books, but I never really got into them, but when I heard this movie was coming out I knew I had to see it. This movie portrays the great works of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko who made Spider-Man into an ever-popular comic book while making Marvel Comics famous.<br />A bite by a rare breed of spiders at the Columbia University science lab gives Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) great vision and a perfect body. He also is also given great agility to jump form large skyscrapers and spin webs from his wrist. Then he assumes the identity of Spider Man to fight off the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe),  that terrorizes the city with a glider that drops several bombs at a time.  Spider-Man nearly loses his life while saving the life of his girlfriend, people who are being threatened to be killed by the Green Goblin, and many innocent people who he doesn't even know. <br />Tobey Maguire, with the emotional lead role overcomes the tragic death of his beloved Uncle Ben, growth trauma's, doubts, sorrows, and fear, to save lives and become the city icon. Willem Dafoe's hystericals and split-personality suffered after a lab-experiment gone wrong make him be a friend one minute and the evil Green Goblin the next. Kirsten Dunst fits the role nicely as Peter's love Mary Jane. Even characters with smaller parts like Peter's Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), and his friend Harry (James Franco) are amazing. Sam Raimi's big-screen version of the Marvel Comic's good-vs-evil Spider-Man comics is portrayed by outstanding acting, eye-popping special effects, great sound and much more. If you are a Spider-Man comic book fan this is a movie you have to see.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|i rented this expecting bad acting , cool effects , and not scary looking monsters. boy am i surprised. i loved it. vin diesel is my fave actor. the only change would be make it longer. hello its 1 hour and 10 minutes long.
B000002AGE|5.0|Heavy Weather is simply one of the most enjoyable album/cd's ever made, and &quot;A Remark You Made&quot; one of the best ballads ever written.
B000001GXE|3.0|I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer below who finds these interpretations too driven.  There's something to be said for Kleiber's intensity, and of course the Vienna Philharmonic's playing is gorgeous.  But I think that the intensity and &quot;driven&quot; quality of Kleiber's approach work better in his recordings of the Beethoven 5th and 7th and the Brahms 4th than they do here; the &quot;Unfinished&quot; calls for intensity, to be sure, but it must be matched by lyricism.  I would suggest that listeners looking for a more balanced approach to this work look to Karl Bhm's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, available in an inexpensive boxed set of all the Schubert symphonies or with the 9th on a super-budget Eloquence CD; I find it an exceptionally natural approach, lyrical and warm yet never lacking dramatic tension.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Most of the time, when I go see a Sandra Bullock movie, I say to myself, &quot;I can't believe I'm going to see this.&quot;  But, the fact is, she's an awesome actress.  She makes any movie she's in worth seeing.  Examples-- I visit my mother for the holidays a few years ago and she wants to see Miss Congeniality and it turns out I liked it a lot.  Go to a friend's house and she wants to watch Hope Floats on TV and I end up glued to the screen.  Put any other actress in movies like these and I probably don't like them.  28 Days is no different.  I never thought Bullock would be believable as an addict but she portrayed the desperation and regrets of an addict and the struggle an addict faces for hope beautifully.  Plus, the supporting characters in the movie were great.  Just like every Bullock movie, there's a scene that seems a bit over-stated or goes beyond believability (who would put up with the way Bullock was acting at the wedding?) but I guess they have to do that to quickly advance the plot of the movie.  This isn't an academy award winning type of movie but it's entertaining and you get a glimpse into addiction.  I thought it was a very special movie but I'm sure most people who see this would end up feeling entertained.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I have seen Wilco/Tweedy play Chicago clubs since A.M. Wilco has always been an unappreciated band on the national scene. The hype this album has gotten I think has more to do with them being dumped by Reprise than anything else (where were these critics for the last two albums?). YHF is a great album and a nice progression by the band. The addition of Glenn Kotche really helped pull their sound together, he is a great drummer. I loved Being There, Summerteeth, and to no suprise, I liked YHF. Wilco is a great band, and I am excited for them that they are getting some pub and critical attention--they deserve it. Wilco ain't the Beatles, but they are imaginative, talented group, who is clearly in it for the music. And I think that passion and love of music shows in their songs and is what attracts me to them.<br />There is also the other side of me who appreciates the holier-than-thou negative reviews here. I kind of hoped for my own selfish reasons that Wilco would again produce a great album, sell a couple hundred thousand albums, not get any attention, and allow me to easily get tix to see them live in a club. Oh well...

0140380221|5.0|Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.<br />Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...<br />Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.<br />Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.<br />Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.<br />All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.<br />This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so.ping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.<br />This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo).

B000063CPL|5.0|This album only confirmed what Maiden fans already knew: Iron Maiden is THE BEST LIVE BAND EVER! This double album and the upcoming DVD should teach these nu metal bands a thing or two.<br />I've been listening to this album for many times, and each time it grows on me. It is far superior to their 1993 live offerings A Real Live One, A Real Dead One and Live at Donington, which were plagued by the sound quality (resembling a bootleg) and Bruce's voice (who was very close to leaving Maiden at that time, 1992, so wasn't really into it anymore). Only time will tell though if this album is better than Live after Death (1985) or not... in any case, both these live albums are masterpieces. So... this album sounds great. Except the excellent band's performance, the first thing you'll notice is the crowd, who sing along even during the instrumental parts (wonder how 250,000 fans sound like?)<br />Now moving on to the setlist... some people may complain because too much of Brave New World is covered (6 songs). My biggest complaint is that there are no songs from the Somewhere in Time album, which is one of my favorite albums. The live tracks unavailable before are the 6 BNW ones and 2 Blaze era tracks (Sign of the Cross sounds awesome).<br />Also included on the CD are two enhanced videos... Brave New World (live from the upcoming DVD) and A Day In The Life, a 10 min film about Iron Maiden. The only thing that [stinks] about these videos is the QuickTime format... I don't know how these videos were encoded, but they are pretty unstable on mostly any computer (actually they're fine if you view them with the program included on the CD, but not with QuickTime Player, which has a lot of other features).<br />In any case, this is a great purchase... and definitely not just for the hard-core Maiden fan. UP THE IRONS!

It<br />is a must read for anyone, who doubts the existence<br />of another world beyond the one we live in.<br />It is insightful and emotional, and speaks freely<br />and frankly about life on the otherside. If you<br />don't believe me...just read the book.<br />I have encouraged many of my families and friends<br />to read this book. Mrs.Eadie does a remarkable job,<br />and should be given credit for being honest and brave<br />enough to come forward with such a personal experience.<br />Knowing that people would more than likely<br />criticize such an event, she believed enough in<br />herself to write about her accounts.<br />If you do anything for yourself...........buy this<br />book, you won't regret it!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have waited half of my life (nine years) for this movie to be made. I remember back then when they were thinking of James Cameron directing and having Michael Beihn (Terminator, GI Jane, The Rock) as Spider-Man. However I don't think Cameron or Beihn could have made this film as good as Raimi and Maguire.<BR>  This is Spider-Man the way I always pictured the movie would be (heck, it's better than what I imagined it would be). The fact that Raimi is a true Spider-Fan radiates throughout this magnificient triumph! He has brought out a film which remains true to the original comic books (okay a few logistical changes here and there), and the action has that vague comic book style melodrama that entertains but doesn't come off as cheesy. My friends who were huge ED fans were pleased to see Bruce Cambell make an appearance. I was also pleased to see Oscar-winner Cliff Robertson.<BR>  If you are a huge Spider-Fan like me, this movie was made for you and you'll love it! In fact, if you don't love this movie there must be something horribly amiss with you.
B00005NNT1|5.0|Loved it as a child and still do.
B000005H40|5.0|To explain to you, just how great this album is; i'm 15 years old and relatively new to jazz (20-30 cd's in my collection). This album is nothing short of amazing, you start of with a classic and fast paced title track, everything from then on just flows. Only track that stands out, in a negative way, in my opinion would be Lazy bird. Still great listening anyhow.
0679720200|4.0|Existentialism, the one thing you must fully understand before reading the stranger, also the ideals existentialism is based around.  It states that your time on this earth is pointless, and no matter what you do, you will end up going to hell and be considered a sinner.  The main character in this book can approach existentialism in 3 different ways.  He can give in and live his life of sin and be doomed to hell, but he will be carefree and worry about nothing he does.  The second is he can stand on the edge so to speak, and live his life the was he thinks is good, and laugh in the face of existentialism.  The third is he can say forget this , and not even believe in it , and live a happy life , with the false idea that in the end he will go to heaven and be loved by god.  The main character takes the first route, and lives his life without care or guilt for his actions, even when he commits a senseless murder on a deserted beach.  He shuns love when it comes his way, and he doesnt really think too much about his actions.  This book becomes more interesting the more you read, and by the end you will discover what a truly well written story it is.
B000006045|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  A little bit on the dark side which makes it all the more appealing to me.  While great to just chill to, it's good in almost any situation.  Very versatile.  Great vocals, great beats.  I loved the whole thing the first time I heard it.<br />Oh yeah..  Listen to track 6 again.  Yep, that's the song Neo was listening to in his headphones near the beginning of The Matrix.  And no it wasn't on the Matrix soundtrack :)
6304508611|5.0|They shouldn't have teased her.<br />They shouldn't have tormented her.<br />They should have left her alone and begged her forgiveness.<br />But now it's too late and they all must pay.<br />Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a shy little teenage girl who wears her hair long, mostly to hide her face, and doesn't have any friends.  According to her peers, she's a Plain Jane Nobody who can't even hit the volleyball right in gym class.  What they don't know about her, of course, is that she's telekinetic.<br />While Carrie is harassed at school, she has an even worse home life.  Her stern, wild-haired religious fanatic of a mother forces her twisted brand of piousness upon Carrie, not allowing her to engage in the \\"sinfulness\\" of dating and making her pray for her \\"sins\\" daily.  Momma doesn't even tell Carrie about the facts of life or the changes her body will undergo during puberty.<br />In fact, Carrie's telekinesis seems to have been triggered by the stress of not knowing what was happening to her when she was visited by her first menstrual period, experienced in innocence  in the shower room of the high school gym.  Thinking she's bleeding to death, Carrie flings herself into the throng of already-dressed girls, pleading for help.  \\"Wanna tampon, Carrie?\\" sneers Chris Hargensen, the beautiful Popular Girl with the perfect blonde hairdo, makeup and figure.  The other girls laugh and Carrie cowers in the shower stall as she is bombarded with sanitary napkins.  \\"Plug it up! Plug it up!\\" chant the other girls, continuing to toss and throw and giggle.  Finally Miss Collins, the gym teacher, rushes into the locker room to see what all the commotion is about.<br />All the girls--except Carrie of course--are given one week's detention as punishment for their prank.  Penalty for skipping detention: refusal of their prom tickets.<br />Fed up with detention, Chris Hargensen marches off--and is barred from attending the prom.  Enraged, she decides to get her revenge, with the help of her thuggish boyfriend, Billy Nolan.  \\"Billy, Billy...ohhh, Billy, I just HATE Carrie White!\\"<br />At home, to some eerily tinkling background music, Carrie drifts down the stairs to Momma, who proclaims: \\"You're a woman now.\\"  Momma's punishment for Carrie's \\"sinful\\" menstruation: locking the poor girl, kicking and screaming, inside a candlelit closet to pray for atonement all night before a statue of a crucified Jesus.<br />Meanwhile, another girl--Sue Snell--feeling guilty for participating in the shower room prank, coerces her boyfriend Tommy Ross, the most popular guy in the entire school, to ask Carrie out to the prom.  Carrie eventually accepts, against Momma's wishes; Momma mumbles prayers while Carrie makes her prom dress.<br />When Tommy actually takes Carrie to the prom, he discovers that the ugly duckling has become a beautiful swan:  her mouth aglow with shimmery pink lipstick, her once-lank long hair turned back in a curl, her body clad in a silken white sheath, Carrie is breathtaking and we can feel her joy as she dances with Tommy, the lights growing brighter and brighter as the two of them twirl round and round, giving a feeling of bliss spinning out of control.<br />Sue Snell, the Good Samaritan, has managed to sneak into the prom and hides behind the King and Queen thrones to watch Carrie's enchantment, growing ever more wondrous and happy when she sees that Tommy and Carrie have been voted King and Queen of the prom.  Sue notices a cord running up over the thrones, snaking up to a metal bucket of something perched on the beam overhanging the precise spot where the Queen will be standing.  She traces the other end to the crawlspace beneath where, silhouetted behind a crepe paper curtain, a hand eagerly holds the rope.<br />What happens next is too terrible to mention and is best left to the imagination.  But that bucket above is the key to a fiery horror from which no one escapes--not even Chris Hargensen, who orchestrated the evil affair.Only Sue manages to survive.  And at Carrie's home, Momma has turned the place into a candlelit church and is lurking menacingly in the shadows with vengeance on her mind.<br />CARRIE is a very good movie--sad, terrifying, and extremely fast-paced.  After watching it, one comes away as if he or she has been through an emotional wringer--and all because of a sad little teenage girl who could make objects move with the sheer force of her mind.
B000001IQH|5.0|I would recommend this be your first Rancid cd... I bought this cd and not long after that back in 99, I had their first 4 cds... I love Rancid now, ...And Out Come the Wolves did it for me now, I own all of them and know most anything about Rancid! This cd ROCKS!!!
B000056K04|1.0|This guy is destined to go down in history as one of the most massively popular but worst artists ever (a la Billy Joel).  Tailor-made pap for middle-aged, middle-to-upper class (see, we can listen to rock and party, too!) suburbanites.  Don yer Dockers and golf shirts, looks like Jimmy Buffet has some competition!
B00004RGUU|5.0|What can be wrong with Paul Neumann and Robert Redford as Butch and Sundance!?  They're great and the movie is wonderful.  If you like westerns, enjoy this two actors (especially when much younger) - get this movie!
B00005JKED|4.0|I liked this movie. My dad bought it for me when I first got home from school.
B000001IPP|5.0|This cd has the main Rancid sound you hear... It has some of my favorites ranging from Side Kick to International Cover-Up back to Salvation or I am the One... This cd is pure Rancid. Get it if you like Rancid or just punk.
B00003CXTG|1.0|First, let me say that I haven't seen the movie. Based on the promos, the INaccuracies were so insulting, I couldn't possibly conceive of seeing it.<BR>To wit: A woman hanging her laundry on an outdoor clothes line with the Japanese airplanes buzzing by.<BR>The fact is, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor at 6:00am.<BR>You may say that it wouldn't be inconceivable for a woman to be hanging laundry at 6am on a Sunday. Fine.<BR>But then what's a little boy doing playing baseball by himself at that hour?<br />Complete and utter HOGWASH.<BR>And if those promo scenes happened prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, wouldn't civilians seeing Japanese airplanes(not to mention the Military) slightly minimize the element of a surprise attack?
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have to say that I don't go to the movies that often (Mainly cause I don't have the time.) I also have never been a huge fan of comic books either. But come on its spider-man. I was totally blown away by this movie. I went on opening night and it was great. This movie exceded all my expectations. The story was great. Also the special effects added to a great story. I have seen all the other movies based on comic books, but this was by far the best. What are you waiting for? Believe the hype... go see SPIDER-MAN. You won't regret it.
B00003CXTG|1.0|First, let me say I haven't seen the movie. But based on the promos for it I was so turned off by the INaccuracy, I refused to see it.<BR>In the promos, there's a woman hanging up her wash on an outdoor clothes line. With the Japanese buzzing past her, presumably on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.<BR>The facts are the Japanese attacked at 6:00am.<BR>Now, you may say that it's possible for a woman to be doing laundry at 6am on a Sunday.<BR>But in the same promo, there's also a little boy playing baseball by himself on a little league field. Also with the Japanese buzzing by.<BR>Complete and utter HOGWASH. And an insult to my intelligence.<BR>Admittedly, since I haven't actually seen the movie, I could be taking these scenes out of context. But if the Japanese planes had been sighted by civilians(not to mention the Military) at a time previous to the invasion, wouldn't that put a damper on a surprise attack?
B00004W50T|5.0|Their first and simply their best album. opening up with Tears Of Rage and finishing( really )with I Shall Be Released ( which may even be better than Dylans version )and the extra tracks included are just a bonus. Especially their version of the blues classic Key To The Highway. Ferdinand The Imposter does'nt have the greatest lyrics ( if you can make them out )but it may be the most catchy band song ever besides The Weight which is also on this album. Four of the extra songs included on this C.D are very similar to the versions on The Basement Tapes ( my favourite album of all time may i add ) and if you ask me some of the greastest Band songs. Other highlights include Lonesome Suzie and In A Station ( both Manuel compositions ) and the cover art is great too aswell as the photos in the booklet. The productions is the rawest of any of the Bands albums ( and if you ask me that's not always a bad thing ), a true rock and roll record. A classic. Buy it.
B00003CXI1|3.0|My son is in the second grade.  He enjoys reading the Harry Potter books.  I have read the 1st one and am enjoying the second one.  I have enjoy the inspiring story as it unfolds.  It's magical and very funny.  There is also mystery & action.  I enjoy the 3 children who played the parts.  There is also love and friendship.  The characters are so imanganative. The sound effects were done very well.  My husband also thought is was inspiring to be so creative.  I liked being able to not guess what was happening next.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This C.D. is GREAT!, \\"I'm a slave 4 u\\", \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Lonely\\", and \\"Cinderella\\" are just some of the great songs on this album, The best song has to be \\"Let Me Be\\"...this c.d. is one to buy.....BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00005JKCF|3.0|Well I went to see the one of my childhood heroes today \\"Spider-Man\\". <br />Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker/\\"Spider-Man\\"); Willem Dafoe (Norman Osborn/\\"The Green Goblin\\"); Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane Watson); James Franco (Harry Osborn); J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson); \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage (\\"Bone Saw\\" McGraw); Rosemary Harris (Aunt May); Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben); Bruce Campbell; Joe Manganiello (Flash Thompson); Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson); Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brant); Ted Raimi (Hoffman); Richard C. Everbeck (Eddie Brock).<br />Toby Maguire as \\"Spider-man\\" once again brings his boyish charisma to the screen; he is a very talented actor with a lot of richness and depth. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris do their equally stellar jobs. The entire supporting cast also held their own. <BR>The movie unfortunately lacked a definite style, the director Sam Raimi, got what he wanted; ''He's a real human being. He has problems. ... This was my hero from my youth.\\" What we did not get was the excitement of a Batman movie or the balance of a Superman movie. Willem Dafoe chews up the scenery as \\"The Green Goblin\\" in classic comic book style. After the first hour I started watching my watch and wondering when the movie would end. The scenes seemed thrown together and the movie was at least twenty minutes too long. It should play well on television. I would have liked to see Joel Schumacher direct a sequel.
6301025040|4.0|FIRST BLOOD was a great movie. It was full of not only action, but also suspense; it had great characterization; and Sly Stalone actually did a fairly decent job of acting. John Rambo, though he was an extra tough hero, was a character that seemed real and one that many people could identify with.<br /><br />In RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD II, John Rambo is back. The movie begins with Rambo working in a prison when he's visited by his former commander, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna). Trautman offers Rambo a chance out of prison with a special assignment that will almost guarantee him a Presidential pardon. The U.S. government is eager to put the fiasco of Vietnam behind and wants to send Rambo into an old Vietcong prison base, which he once escaped from, to take pictures proving once and for all that there are no American POW's left in Vietnam. Along the way, Rambo loses his camera, but brings back even better proof: a live POW. Unfortunately at the sight of the POW, the bureaucrat in charge orders the pickup to abandon Rambo and company. Big mistake.<br /><br />RAMBO lacks much of the emotional depth that made FIRST BLOOD so enduring. In FIRST BLOOD, John Rambo was a real person. In RAMBO, he has become a one man army, straight off the pages of a comic book. The movie is also full of discrepancies, plot holes, and blunders. Nevertheless, RAMBO remains a classic action flick. Most of the action films of the 1980s and early 1990s were patterned off of RAMBO. It's a fun movie to watch and it's great to see a non-politically correct American action hero kicking the tar out of some evil Communists.
0446677450|4.0|I am just getting started on learning about finances and this book came HIGHLY recommended by people that are successful.  I have learned alot and Needed a more motivational book to get started, and keep me going through all those Dry books that I know will help me :)<BR>I am a daughter of parents that were every two week paycheck people.  Now I am in Real Estate and realized that this is a whole different ball game.  I have and am identifing with mentalities that go along with feeling like your entitled to a paycheck because you worked.  NOT..  He very accurately describes the Rat Race that most people put themselves in instead of enjoying life.  I plan to enjoy life because &quot;it is a good life&quot;
B00005JKCF|5.0|True Believers! For one reason or another, you fell in love with Spider-man. Maybe it was the comic books, or the cartoon series. But in any case, you fell in love with the Web-head. You wanted to be him. Climbing walls, swinging high over the busiling streets of the city that never sleeps. It was intriguing, beguiling, a dream within a dream come true. And now, it's just that, a dream come true...<br />Sam Raimi, along with the talents of Tobey Maguire, Kristin Dunst, and Willem Dafoe, all courtesey of the colorful imagination of Stan Lee, have created the best comic book movie adaptation (dare I say it, ok...) EVER! All your expectations are dashed and surpassed in over 2 hours of nothing but web-slinging action. I was totally blown away. Sam Raimi certainly had a definite vision for Spider-Man, and it shows. He faithfully recreates a hyper-reality New York City for Spidey. His execution of the mythos of Spider-Man onscreen is simply flawless. <br />And in these troubled times, isn't this what movie goers and film buffs want? Pure escapist fiction, comic books superheroes and exploits come to life. Stuff blows up, and throw in some computer-generated images for the kiddies, and patriotism for 9/11. Character and plot development, (the tormented superhero, and average joe who must struggle with the great power he has acquired and the great responsibility that he must deal with) along with exceptional talent and a director with a keen eye for the action flick to boot. Simply, it's pure movie magic.  <br />You're a Spidey fan, and to see these characters come to life on the screen, in such an excellent manner, and it's just TOO much. I was estatic, the entire film. Spider-Man stands alone by itself a remarkable picture. Why criticize it when there's so much to love about it? Spider-Man has it all. Columbia Pictures, Sony, and of course Raimi and Maguire have their work cut out for them for years to come, both financially, and professionally. <br />It's Spider-Man, the comic book, the hero, the man, come to life. Don't miss this exceptional movie!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie, I think Will Smith did a good job portraying Ali, but the special they did on television a few years ago was better.  For the length and the star cast of this movie, it should have been more around Ali's life, and not just boxing, we can still see original film of his bouts with Frazier, Foreman.  How many children does he have? how many times has he been married? when did the first signs of his disease develop?  What is his fatherly relationship that made his daughter decide she wanted to box?  Too much information that could have been implemented in this movie that wasn't and they always say that a great movie cannot be made about a person, until that person is no longer among us and at this rate, Ali has been portrayed too many times, that it will not have the same effect later in years.  Will Smith should have had a better script and storyline on portraying Ali, he was outstanding and its good to know that he has the ability to act as a boxer and get into the role, but the storyline to me suffered.  I give the thumbs up to the actors, but the writer and the release of information from Muhammed Ali was not enough.<BR>I recommend the t.v version of the movie with the guy from Sparks over this version.  (Sorry, this is my true opinion).
6304873441|5.0|This is my favourite animated movie of all-time! It has beautiful animation and music. The characters are spunky and quite refreshing after all the redundant Disney heroes. Many cranky critics complain about the plot and having a typical villian and how it ignores the reality of the communist revolution. But, hello? Might I point out that the directed audience is at children? They NEED a typical villian. They're kids. They need an obvious source of evil. And about the plot? The plot isn't actually that bad if you have absolutely no clue about history but give me a break. It's a cartoon. Lighten up, it's a good movie. But to me the best part is that unlike most disney movies,<BR>Anastasia beats up her boyfriend and then saves [him] from Rasputin. All in all, an absolutely lovely movie.
6304595247|4.0|Those who have seen The English Patient in 1996 must have wondered whether Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes have acted together in another film before. Wuthering Heights is the classic sample to pave the way for Juliette to get the Oscar. I do wish that the DVD manufacturers out there could consider to to turn this VHS into DVD for collector's items, at least we could enjoy a better picture and sound.
B00004T8RK|4.0|This CD doesn't have hits you've heard on your radio, and doesn't have as much up-front attraction as an album like &quot;Ten&quot;.  But, if you give it some time to grow on you, it'll be your number one pick long term.  Through the entire album the songs are so musical, rocky, and real.
B00005YW4H|2.0|This is not a bad record by any means. But people speak of this marginally talented woman like she's on the level of someone great. I expected a jazz record, I got light pop that doesn't even approach the level of early Joni Mitchell. The songwriting is amateurish, with many songs in C major, and more having that same descending bassline over and again that lands on the sharp four. Boring. The lyrics...ugh...don't get me started. Jesse Harris' tunes are the highlights, but Norah's got a ways to go. It just shows that her sex appeal gets confused for innovative talent. If she buys her hype ala Diana Krall, she'll be done in three years, back to being a waitress. But if she learns harmony, works on her voice, reads some real poetry and applies that knowledge to her craft, she might be something. But I'm not optimistic. Her generation is all about the money and the fame, and they view mediocrity as being the pinnacle of all acheivement. Norah Jones is a nice little pop singer with minimal skill as a songwriter, a lovely voice, and a pretty voice. She has nothing to say, yet. Maybe she'll surprise us and become great. But at what price?
B000002AZ8|4.0|This CD has great angry/rebellious sounding rock tracks, plus two EXTREMELLY poignant songs in &quot;Nothingman&quot; and &quot;Betterman&quot;.  This is as good a Pearl Jam album you'll find anywhere: catchy hits from the radio, hard energy, and profound sweetness.
6303431038|5.0|Historical inaccuracies aside, this movie was the best I've seen in a long while.  Kevin Costner was even colder than usual (as in \\"For the Love of the Game\\"), an expressionless look on his face for much of the movie, but anything else would not have done justice to the character.  The supporting cast was unremarkable, but Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was incredible...in my opinion, he stole the show and deserved much more screen time.  While many of the Earp brothers (excluding Wyatt, of course) were faceless and often difficult if not impossible to tell apart, Quaid captured Doc Holliday's character in every action--speaking, riding, making one of those cynical and hilarious one-liners (Like when Wyatt confides in Doc that he is his closest friend, and Holliday replies, after a long silence, \\"Shut up,\\" or when he comments that Wyatt wants to be a lawman and an outlaw, getting \\"the best of both worlds.\\").  It took me a considerable amount of time, at least an hour, to finally believe the video case and conclude that Doc Holliday was in fact played by Dennis Quaid.  How did that large, handsome, all-american actor from \\"Frequency\\" manage to pull off a skinny, dying man?  And that voice...I loved the voice of Doc Holliday, and would rewind the tape sometimes to listen again.  Rich and deep, it was the only thing that ultimatly conviced me that Holliday was played by Quaid.<BR>Undoubtably a movie worth seeing, even more than once, I recommend Wyatt Earp to anyone.
B00000099Y|5.0|The music on this CD is genius.  If you consider yourself to have decent musical instinct, then I believe you cannot fail to derive pleasure from this album; it's phenominally creative and masterful.  It'll also help if you're into dark things, anger, and rage.
B00005JKCF|5.0|For years, Spider-Fans have been waiting for a movie adaptation of their favorite wall-crawler's exploits.  Finally, they have it.Spider-Man is everything it should be, and more.  Tobey Maguire excels as the ultimate Everyman superhero, capturing the full range of emotion as the character stumbles to transform from gawkish high school geek to media sensation to genuine hero.  Willem Defoe is the perfect Norman Osborne; his Green Goblin is both scarier and more credible than Jack Nicholson's Joker.  And Kirsten Dunst lights up every frame as the fiery-haired Mary Jane.  The effects are brilliant, the production lavish, and the script surprisingly intelligent and literate.  Moreover, the straightforward moral of the film--with great power comes great responsibility--is a welcome relief from the ugly amorality that too often fills modern comic books.  Faithful to the comics from which it was spawned, Spider-Man is an instant action classic.  In one word?  Amazing.  Of course.
B000002BYD|3.0|This CD has a number of very contageous tracks.  It'll give you some quite hard and bangish jams, as well as a few nostalgic, sweet tunes.  You might have heard a song from this album on your radio, and maybe not.  But if what you're looking for is just plain music that your soul will enjoy if you listen, bon appetite.
B000063CPL|3.0|I was listening Maiden England on my Stereo and i thought to make a review of one of the saddest live albums of a metal band since S&amp;M. This album has nothing new to offer except Sign of The Cross and Clansman vastly superior to the version sung by Blaze. Nothing new at all. Buy it if its your first Maiden album
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is like a freakin' brother to me.  It'll give you a nearly eternal anger and hatred outlet, because the lyrics are so straight up evil; and the rhythms and rhymes that permeate nearly every song are extraordinally creative and maddeningly infectious.  It's like a...trip to hell.
0375703764|4.0|I picked up this book because the plot sounded too wonderfully creepy to resist - a photographer who moves his family into a house which is somehow larger on the inside than on the outside. Flipping through the pages, I started to get a little exasperated at all the typical po-mo gimmicks - pages you have to flip to read, pages with one letter on them, pages with little red boxes listing architectural details, pages of footnotes that don't exist. With some reservation, I bought it anyway, and I'm glad I did. <br />Underneath all the narrative layering is one of the spookiest haunted house stories I've ever read - maybe even because of the narrative layering. We're told that the structural impossibilities of the House On Ash Tree Lane are recorded on a video that may not exist, written in a review by an author who might have made it up, retold (presumably to Danielewski) by a guy who might be insane. Okay. <br />If you want to read this book with the intent to gain insight into the complex world of narrative, go right ahead. Me, I wanted to get scared sh--less. The great thing about this book is that it can work on both levels. Admittedly, I grew tired pretty quickly of the 'Johnny Truant' parts and began to skim over them to get to the meat of the story, namely the Zampano account of the Navidson Record. Who cares if the whole thing might be made up? It's a hella scary read. <br />Danielewsky (the real author) has a gift for embuing words with a certain eerie significance so that when you see them written on a page, you feel a little shiver. He transforms ordinary words (most notably, 'house') and twists it into something odd, menacing, frightening. Same with 'Delial'. As the record reaches towards the end, the tension builds up in each word until just seeing it printed makes you want to scream. <br />Similiarly, I found the loooooong list of architectural features that were missing from each dark room that wasn't supposed to be there hideously scary. There's something about the intricate detail, even the odd juxtaposition of the letters themselves, that works to convey the horrible wrongness of these rooms existing. <br />Very effective. For a few weeks after I had finished the book I couldn't even look into a dark room. 4 stars because I did skip over the Johnny Truant story.
B000002TPS|4.0|On one of those \\"Saturday afternoon browsing the used CD bins\\" trips to my local record store, I happened upon this album and thought, \\"Hmmm...I wonder how Megadeth's sound changed in the 90s?\\" You see, I didn't keep up with the band after 'Rust in Piece.' I had really no idea what they'd sound like. So a quick purchase later and I was off to check it out.<br />One word review: Very good. Damn, that's 2 words. I always sucked at math anyway. As many other reviewers have already identified, it's WAY more melodic than I would've ever expected from a 'Deth record. Not melodic in the sense that record companies use today (i.e. uhh, guys, the album's not selling at all, let's tell everyone it's MELODIC grind. That oughtta do it). Anyway, I digress. It's melodic in that I found myself spending the entire damn 40+ minutes bouncing my feet, nodding my head, and finger-drumming on the table. All without meaning to. Yes, it's an extremely infectious album and really shouldn't be overlooked by either Megadeth fans or non-Megadeth fans.<br />Strangely enough, the album seems to get stronger as you delve deeper into it. Two of my favorite tracks are the last 2: \\"Black Curtains\\" is simply ripping and if you don't believe me, check out the seriously inspired riffage at around the 3:00 mark, and \\"Victory\\" is as strong an album closer as you could hope for. It seems as if Dave had been listening to quite a bit of late-80s Maiden for the guitarwork on that song. But all in all, a strong, chunky, Megadeth release that will not disappoint.
B000002JSZ|4.0|This is the last AC/DC album that Phil Rudd is drummer on for 12 years (he regrouped with the boys in 1995 for \\"Ballbreaker\\").  Rudd and Cliff Williams' rock-steady bass are the driving force behind \\"Flick of the Switch\\" over which Brian Johnson lays his gravelly voice and Angus Young plasters his killer guitar licks.  This is one album that completely *gels* and if it doesn't gel, then it isn't aspic.  The best tunes on this record (now CD, but I own the original vinyl as well) are \\"Bedlam in Beligum,\\" \\"Guns for Hire,\\" \\"Deep in the Hole\\" and the title track.  They've got that inimitable cocksuredness (pun intended) in Angus' solos and Johnson really could wail back then.  Later on, in albums like \\"The Razor's Edge\\" he sounded like he was singing through a breathing tube.<br />This album also marks the band's trend towards bluesy, backbeat tunes;  You can set your car's timing chain to Williams' bass on \\"Bedlam in Belgium.\\"  Angus' opening riff on \\"Guns for Hire\\" actually sounds more like a knife, slashing it notes out in a rapt marcato.<br />This CD rules, and is their last great album until \\"Ballbreaker.\\"  The remastering is clean, but not antiseptic.  Buy this one!
B000062Y98|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: This is Metal. Gloriously orchestrated, bombastic at times, gorgeously lilting at others, but metal through and through. There are many fans of the Bards out there who hearken and long for the days of old, the speed metal German madness made famous (overseas, at least) by Hansi and company during the 90s.<br />Hey, I loved it too. In the year+ now that I've discovered, enjoyed and thoroughly digested the Guardians' catalog, I can say with complete honesty and fervor that A Night At The Opera is their shining moment. The disc cover says their the \\"most musically significant band since Iron Maiden.\\" They might very well be. Remember the time when 'Run to the Hills' was on MTV heavy rotation? Blind Guardian can have that impact.<br />Musically, this album is patterned not far from Queen's heyday (when they realized their talents and just peaked), coincidentally (?) with the breakthrough launch of their own 'At Night At The Opera.\\" Like that album, this is chock full of epic, grandiose music. And moreso than ever, Hansi Kursch's songwriting ability has truly blossomed. The 1-2 punch of \\"Precious Jerusalem\\" and \\"Battlefied\\" are all you need to know that the Bards are not shedding their metal skin. I mean, just listen to the frantic \\"Risin' up from the heart of the desert / Risin' up for Jerusalem...\\" coupled with the warlike, military drum madness provided by Thomas Stauch. It's un-believable! \\"Battlefield\\" draws subtly disguised comparison to E.L.O. believe it or not. Listen to the superbly crafted bridge/chorus if you don't remember (or don't believe me). I for one cannot freaking wait to fly to Atlanta for their first concert ever on North American soil! Simply thinking of the entire concert hall belting out \\"There on the battlefield he stands / Down on the battlefield he's lost / And on the battlefield it ends\\" - it's going to be, well, epic.<br />The album never lets up, and never loses focus or momentum. Song after song, Blind Guardiando not descend the mountain it took more than a decade to summmit. With more variety on this disc than the average metal band has in their entire catalog, there is surely something here to please any and all fans of this legendary band, and convert quite a few new fans as well, I'm certain. The album is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and take the plunge so you don't miss what's been crafted here.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I haven't been exposed to Bob Dylan very much but when I saw him perform on the Grammy Awards, I had to get \\"Love and Theft\\". I'm enthralled with the musical composition, lyrics, and personally applied interpretation of whatever may suit one's lifestyle. The lyrics makes one take a self-inventory of how they interact with humanity.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz.  The very thought of a successful cartoon band sounds very weird.  Yet this group has made it to the very top of the charts, and is finally getting recognition in the states.  If you have ever heard Blur, you would love Gorillaz, since the lead singer's (2D) counterpart is Damon, the lead singer from Blur.  The songs are very creative, and each song has a different feel.  From the raps songs &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;, to fun mellow songs like &quot;Re-Hash&quot;, &quot;19-2000&quot;, &quot;Brother&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;.  If you like the feel of &quot;Latin Simone&quot;, but don't like the Spanish vocals, I would suggest buying &quot;G-Sides&quot;, for it has the english version.<br />The cd is one of the best of 2001, and certianly one of the most creative.  This is one cd everyone can enjoy, and I guarentee you'll be hearing alot of Gorillaz in the future.
B000006NPY|5.0|First of all, to all the critics and fans who criticized the Pumpkins for changing their sound--SO WHAT?!?!? Rock music is all about deviating from the norm, isn't it? I think that the fact the Pumpkins chose to change their sound temporarily is OKAY! Anyhow, ADORE deals with common Pumpkins themes--life, love, and loss. It is a melodic and haunting work--definitely good &quot;thought&quot; music. I recommend that every music fan own this one.
038533558X|5.0|One more time, Harlan Coben has written a superb mystery where every page adds another totally unexpected twist.  This book didn't have as many extreme plot turns as his last, &quot;Tell No One,&quot; but it is really close.<br />As you have read, the plot revolves around poor Will, who has to be the unluckiest man in love ever.  His first love is murdered, his worshipped brother is the suspected killer and has been on the lam for 11 years, his current lover is missing.  Can things get much worse?  Of course they can because Coben makes up good stuff!!  I refuse to say any more about the story because to do so would ruin it for you.<br />Suffice to say, the different story lines become interwoven, and downright creepy.  I have followed Coben's writing since his very first novel and, in my humble opinion, he keeps getting better and better.<br />If you only read one or two novels a year, this is a don't miss for sure.  If you read hundreds of novels a year, this is one you won't forget.  &quot;Gone for Good&quot; is a great read, filled with suspense and the knowledge that Coben won't let you figure it out; he always has one more surprise up his sleeve. And the surprises just keep on coming.  Buy it, Read it, Relish it.  This book is one of the year's best!
0446310786|5.0|I am 15 years old, and I just read this story about a week ago for my tenth grade english class.  Most of the kids didn't like the story and they didn't catch all of the wonderful lessons and morals that came along with it.  They didn't understand that this book could teach you a lot about life.  It taught me a bundle.  I realized all of the racist remarks that go on at school everyday, and I learned that courage is definatly not an action that doesn't involve brains.  Please, read this book with an open mind and experience the new outlooks on life that even a 7 year old girl and see.  If she can do it, you can!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Forget about Superman. Forget about Batman. The Spider-Man comic to screen adaptation lays waste to all the others. Spider-Man was SWEET! I was raised in the Marvel Universe where Spider-Man was and is the number one hero. For all us web heads out there who have been waiting 30 years for this movie, our time come. This ride was better than reading the comic books. Your imagination is what makes reading so special. Sam Raimi has taken your imagination and dreams of the web-slinger right out of your head and put them on the big screen. This movie could not possibly have been done any better that it is. Go out and enjoy... and see it again and again.

If theres anything as scary as it, its ronald mcdonald...<br />The films got a good storyline like, but if it wasnt for the clown I'd give it 5 stars...
B00005JKL8|1.0|This movie really [stunk] big, lots of plot holes and some very not real action very unreal. Dont see this movie unless you want alot of action. The action was pretty good. Just fake. Owen wilson was very disapointing and hackman just didnt seem as good, didnt put in much effort~
630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady, an adaptation of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, has as<br />its core the transformation of a poor, undernourished flower<br />girl with a cockney accent into a polished, sophisticated,<br />regal woman, a princess or queen. Julie Andrews is totally<br />unsuited to the film role. On stage, perhaps, her voice carried<br />her performance because close-ups were not possible. Julie<br />Andrews would have destroyed the film version had she been<br />cast in it.<br />Jack Warner must have known this when he rejected Julie as the<br />film version of Eliza. Look at Mary Poppins. She's rock solid.<br />Julie is perfect for that role. Look at her character in the<br />Sound of Music. Again, rock solid. How could she portray a near<br />street urchin in the cold and damp streets of Victorian England?<br />Only on the stage where close-ups were not available.<br />On the other hand, Audrey's Vogue model look is perfect for the<br />role of the nearly starving Eliza. Further, her transformation<br />into a woman of royal blood is perfectly suited to Audrey, as<br />she was in fact born of a noble family of Europe. Not that the<br />mannerisms could not have been learned by Julie Andrews, but<br />Audrey did not have to LEARN them for the role. The mannerisms<br />were part of her, there from birth.<br />The only mistake Jack Warner made was not letting Audrey use her<br />own voice because even though it would not be as multi-octave as<br />Julie's, you wouldn't expect such a perfect voice from a<br />starving flower girl and how could she miraculously develop it<br />along with proper pronunciation? That would be too much too<br />swallow. If you doubt this, listen to the extras in this DVD<br />with Audrey's voice in place of the dubber's.<br />This DVD version of My Fair Lady brings forth all of the magic<br />and original color and sound that the restored VHS version<br />provided along with the added ease of moving from scene to<br />scene, and back again, of DVD. It's just an added bonus.<br />Fortunately for posterity, only Audrey Hepburn will be<br />remembered as Eliza Doolittle. A movie with a soundtrack<br />will be more memorable to future generations than a soundtrack alone.<br />Audrey Hepburn is and always will be the only true Eliza. The<br />only true My Fair Lady. Great DVD.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness stands alone as one of the most influencial albums of the mid 90's. Spawning 5 singles, a box set, and millions of fans worldwide, I think much respect is deserved to this band and their awesome work. <br />During this time period after their major label debut with Virgin Records (Siamese Dream), the Pumpkins finally got a grasp of what they were dealing with...they were now famous and radio-friendly. The four singles of their previous album had put them on the map - and they were on the road to stardom. In late 1994, the band started getting really hot, performing brand new tunes such as Speed, Mouths Of Babes, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Jellybelly, among many others. They produced four full length demo tapes, thats right...FOUR demos that contained everything that was to be on the album and more. Billy had also produced two demos himself, which were also chock full of other songs that unfortunately never showed up on any compilation or album. The original plan for this album was 28 album tracks, 28 b-sides, with 5 singles. This was a VERY big decision for the band, because they had completed and rehearsed over EIGHTY SONGS for the album, and could only choose a select few. The choosing was superb, but there were still so many tunes that had been unreleased. And, with no future plans to release any of this material, one day billy caught a fan on the street, invited them over, dug through his old demos, and gave a 110-minute tape called the \\"Gravity Demos\\". He gave strict instructions to the fan to \\"spread this.\\" The rest is history.<br />This album is rock solid, and I don't think it should be overlooked at all. Every track on this album from the beautiful piano instrumental \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\\" to the beautiful closure of \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" is amazing. This is one album you cannot afford to miss. ~infalliable_mistake
B00005QXDD|5.0|Yes this CD is funny, (although watching the HBO specials really helps out) but let us not over look the great playing that goes on throughout this CD.  The drumming is awesome, the production is far better than most \\"joke\\" bands or for that matter better sounding than most serious bands.  One could easily replace the silly lyrics and campy breaks (why?) and call this a credible record.  That makes this release even funnier because this record is far better than many of the new metal bands that all sound the same, and pout for the camera.  Maybe if bands didn't take themselves so seriously more great releases like this would occur.  This is not just a funny CD, there is some serious musicianship going on in the songs.
B000002U9E|5.0|\\"The Dreaming\\" showed Kate Bush moving away from the accessible sound of her rather underproduced early albums to take full control of her work. Themes of mysticism were evident there but flower remarkably on this work, which stands as greatest example of popular music's mystical side. The whole album describes a woman aiming to establish contact with the Divine and those she encounters in this quest for experience. In some ways, \\"Hounds Of Love\\" is quite like a medieval mystic's tale, but Bush is wonderfully effective in presenting it in modern language. {It was said that Madonna was able to combine the images of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene on \\"Like A Prayer\\" - Kate Bush built a career out of doing that!!}.<BR>The music is more consistent than on \\"The Dreaming\\" indeed the first side is by far her most consistent work, with \\"Running Up That Hill\\" being a typical mid-paced tale of mystical experience, and \\"Mother Stands for Confort\\" benefitting from Eberhard Weber's brilliant bassline. The title tune and \\"Cloudbusting\\" continue with the spiritual journey, but \\"The Big Sky\\" may be her finest-ever moment, with her deep vocals keeping the song going over beneath Charlie Morgan's wonderfully dense drumming. On that song, Alan Murphy also show her finest piece of guitar work.<BR>\\"The Ninth Wave\\", the second side, includes the beautiful ballads \\"And Dream Of Sheep\\", \\"Watching You Without Me\\" and \\"The Morning Fog\\", and the adapted traditional Irish tune \\"Jig Of Life\\", with its luscious, dense pipes and fiddles. The whole of \\"The Ninth Wave\\" turns the mystical themes of the first side into the tale of a drowning woman's trial and fight against evil forces of corrupt politicians (\\"Waking The Witch\\" shows her refusal to play the role of a devil in the line \\"Bless me Father for I have sinned\\"). \\"Hello Earth\\" shows the apocalyptic tone of \\"The Dreaming\\" once more (All you sailors/Get out of the waves, get out of the water...All you fishermen/Head for home/Go to sleep little Earth).<BR>Sara Maitland once wrote of \\"Sophia dancing in the chaos\\". That line sums up the theme of this whole album, and indeed, much of Kate Bush's career.<BR>Remarkably, considering its esoteric theme and lavish arrangements, \\"Hounds of Love\\" reached the Australian Top 10, and stands as Kate Bush's finest work.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I yesterday witnessed The Spiderman Movie expecting alot, I have never really read many comic books or cartoon movies of Spiderman but since there was such a huge hype I had to see the movie.<br />I must say that they did a fantastic job on teaching the audience on how Peter Parker began his journey onto becomming Spiderman, the movie also did a great job on making the movie feel like a Comic Book come to life. <br />Anyways although almost everything was great about the movie I still had a few question left in my head.<br />I still am not sure where those dam spider webs attach to, for the most part of the movie it looks like there being attached to the clouds. Also The Green Goblins outfit was made interily out of metal which shoulent have been. When the Green Goblin would talk his mouth would not move because of the costume problem. Also I dont see how people would not notice a giant web comming out of Spidermans arm especcially when he is in the Cafeteria.<br />Anyways, despite those very minor problems the movie is a must see. Spiderman fans will want to see it tons of times as everyone else will still most likely enjoy it. <br />I Would definately Recommened it.

B00005JKCF|1.0|I was so excited to see spiderman, i had heard all the hype, the previews looked mind blowing... Toby Maguire provides a decent performance as Peter Parker in the begining, but when he turns spiderman he [stinks]. The acting was poor, the long drawn out proffesions of love by kirsten dunst and peter parker made me want to throw something at the screen. A slow begining just got progressivly worse. I couldn't believe it. When the green goblin, who looked like an idiot in that suit, said \\"the itsy bitsy spider\\" i wanted to walk out. If it hadn't been so close to the end of the movie i would have. Never have i been so dissapointed in a movie, ever. The only other movie i've seen in theaters that bad was Wing Commander with Freddie Prince JR. Props to Josh Krogan of Nickleback for writing an awesome song. Wait for it to go to the dollar movies. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours and 7 bucks.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Don't believe everything you read, listen to the record and decide for yourself. In my opinion, this is a beautiful, brilliant record. Including the not-so-pretty-or-tuneful parts, they just make the pretty, jammy, unbelievably tuneful parts better. <BR>Tweedy and company have more music sensibility in their pinky fingernail than most other songwriters combined. <br />\\"Kamera\\", is a pure Pop gem. \\"Pot Kettle Black\\", combines the the different elements on the record to make it the most complete, in my opinion. The others are as excellent, if not better. For me, the record takes a journey: up, down and in between. Solid songcraft enhanced by accomplished musicianship, unique instrumentation (radio and electronic sounds included) and heart-felt, thought-provoking lyrics. Inventive, insightful and rooted in Rock n' Roll. It's nothing new, Wilco have been doing it all along. They just keep getting better at it.<br />Have an open mind, set aside your pre-conceived ideas and enjoy. I know I am.

038533558X|5.0|All of Harlan Coben's books have been excellent but he has far-surpassed himself in his latest, Gone For Good. Be prepared that when you sit down to start this book you won't want to get up until you finish it. It's one of those books that you don't want to stop reading and, at the same time, never want to end. Gone For Good is a rollercoaster of suspense and a tale of haunting love. Coben's skills in plot and character development, narration, and creating credible, edge-of-the seat suspense keep getting better and better. After reading Tell No One, I wondered if Coben had reached the top of his abilities. While there are some similarities in these two books, Gone For Good is by far Coben's best work to date. Now, I'm wondering again if he's reached his zenith. But, when his next book comes out, I'll be one of the first on line to find out.<br />Without going into detail, Gone For Good is about Will Klein's discovery after eleven years that his older brother, who was accused of murdering the girl Will had loved and disappeared afterwards, may not be &quot;gone for good.&quot; To quote the jacket cover, &quot;In Gone For Good, Harlan Coben has written one of those rare thrillers that will not only make the pulse pound, but stir the heart as well.&quot;<br />Now, rush out and get a copy of Gone For Good and have an immensely enjoyable reading experience!
B00004WG2X|2.0|I will start by saying that I had viewed the magnificent Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" before this particular version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.  But I am usually a pretty open-minded person, so I figured I'd give this version a look, since I truly enjoy the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's terrific novel.<br />It has been widely said that Elizabeth Garvie was a more compelling Elizabeth Bennet.  In this regard, though Ms. Garvie was quite capable in my eyes, her interpretation of Lizzie for me came across at times as almost...meek.  This is not complete bias to Ms. Ehle, whom I believe imbued Lizzie with fire and intellect, but something I merely felt did not \\"translate\\" properly with Ms. Garvie's Elizabeth (OK, maybe there is some bias.  But Ms. Garvie *does* have nice screen presence, as well.  It is merely different in nature.).  One scene in particular:  The proposal from Mr. Collins.  In the earlier version, Lizzie, it seems, is too gentle with Mr. Collins upon refusing his offer.  The words are right, but the mood is...off.  Contrast this to Ehle's portrayal -- I could see Elizabeth's chagrin, disdain, and reluctance in having to hear Mr. Collins' offer, and her offense when Mr. Collins implied that she was merely a silly female and playing hard to get.<br />The supporting cast of this earlier adaption, right or wrong, did not seem to \\"gel\\" for me.  In terms of each character, I much pereferred Susannah Harker's Jane (1995).  Yes, perhaps Jane in the '80s version was conventionally prettier, but Ehle and Harker sold me on the sisterly affection they shared for each other, whereas I did not feel that in the earlier adaption.  For that matter, I also think Julia Sawalha's Lydia in the A&E presentation was much more fleshed out as the officer-crazy, flighty girl she is supposed to be...and that helped to better set the foundation for her elopement with Wickham, since we're privy to her flighty, thoughtless nature.  I will easily admit that Mary, in this BBC version, does not seem as sour and had better characterization.  The later Mary seemed almost ashamed and resentful of her entire family.  Here, Mary is studious but not with too much \\"bite\\".  Since Kitty was so peripheral in both productions, it is a draw, but I think she was much more age-appropriate in the 1995 version and meshed well with her \\"partner-in-crime\\", Lydia.  Then we come to Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  I believe that Alison Steadham's portrayal in 1995 was a hoot...but Mrs. Bennet often seemed too over the top...very exaggerated.  I feel that her earlier portrayal rang more three-dimensional.  Yes, she was excitable and sometimes crass, but she did not seem overly so, as later portrayed.  But Mr. Bennet...I *much* preferred Benjamin Whitrow's interpretation in the A&E version.  His character had the sarcasm, humor, and wit but without the caustic nature.  It seemed to me as if he almost despised everyone in his family in the 1980s BBC adaption -- including Elizabeth.  The later adaption, for me, showed a man put upon but with love for his girls (even if his favorite was clearly Lizzie -- just look at the final scene before the end of the A&E version).  The rest of the supporting cast in both versions have their pluses and minuses.  For instance, Ms. Bingley did not come across as spiteful and cruel in the earlier version, but Mr. Collins is even more of a buffoon than portrayed in 1995.  It's all a matter of nuance, and what an individual prefers.  I find that though Garvie is charming, I much prefer Ehle's spicier Elizabeth.<br />Finally, Mr. Darcy.  David Rintoul seemed like an adequate actor...but he did not do the part of Darcy justice.  Yes, Darcy was a proud and arrogant man.  But I feel he missed the hidden layers that were beneath the surface.  Most of poor Mr. Rintoul's scenes simply had him glaring at those around him.  His face never seemed to soften, and, even when he was supposed to be changing for the love of Elizabeth, he seemed much too...stiff.  (HERE, I can clearly admit to bias overwhelmingly in favor of the outstanding Colin Firth.  His Mr. Darcy was a chameleon, and we were privy to every change in mood and demeanor.  To be fair, however, Mr. Rintoul did not have the luxury of showing all that Darcy did for his sister and Elizabeth, as Firth did when going after Wickham and Lydia, for example.)  Most of all, I feel that Rintoul and Garvie, while pleasant to view, did not \\"click\\".  Firth/Ehle had a powerful, magical chemistry that immediately drew me into wanting their Darcy and Elizabeth to fight their obstacles and be together.  Again, however, this is neither wrong nor right, but a matter of personal preference.  Your mileage may vary.<br />In essence, if you are a theater buff, this version may please you greatly.  The style of filming has an almost play-like quality to it, and the simplicity *does* offer a sort of charm for the BBC adaption.  Here, this is not a minus and would not be fair to deem it so because of the vast budgetary differences between the two.  However, if you're a viewer who enjoys intricacies of plot and depth, as well as first-rate aesthetics (costumes, dances, music, gorgeous scenery), I recommend spending a bit more on the A&E adaption.  It's three-hundred (quick!) minutes very well spent and highly addicting.
B0000042MY|5.0|I must say that this is the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard.The sheer beauty of it can make one cry.(the best music for the best movie of all time) If you want something to listen to that you will never forget, try this. You will never put it down. The way this was put together is amazing. The music fits in with the film perfectly. It is truely a work of art and I am so glad that it was put together. When you hear it after seeing the film, you will always picture the scenes in your mind. It will touch your heart.<BR>This music has changed the way I view art forever. I will never hear a piece so touching. On this CD you hear so many emotional sounds. You get every feeling from this CD. You get love,hate,life,death,triumph,and loss. Like I said, it will haunt your life and your heart forever. SO BUY IT AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS. Thank you
B00005MP58|5.0|What can be said that no one else has?<br />Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle both shine as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet.  The chemistry cannot be beat, and Ms. Ehle portrays Elizabeth as the fiery young woman I believe Jane Austen had envisioned.  There are no words to describe the magnificent portrayal of Mr. Darcy by Colin Firth.  This Mr. Darcy is no \\"one-trick pony\\".  Yes, Mr. Darcy first comes across as almost boorish.  But thanks to Firth's polished nuance, we see the inevitable evolution from cold prideful aristocrat to a kindhearted man in love without the evolution becoming corny or contrived.  Mr. Darcy is fully fleshed out.  It's evident just what his sister, Georgianna, means to him.  The same applies to his growing respect, admiration, and love for Elizabeth.  Firth can say tons with his eyes than most can with pages and pages of dialogue.  (OK, OK, so it doesn't hurt that Mr. Firth is also gorgeous.  Lake scene, anyone?  He makes six hours fly by in a rush, making you wish there was more to watch.)<br />Jennifer Ehle impressed me greatly with her interpretation of Elizabeth.  She had the aura of kindness that Elizabeth was supposed to possess, but that kindness did not make her too soft.  She had keen wit, intelligence, and passion under the surface.  It is these characteristics that makes Firth/Ehle sparkle.  Firth's Darcy meets Ehle's Elizabeth comment for comment.  (The dance at the Netherfield Ball, and the ensuing barbed exchange, is a particularly favorite scene of mine.)  That chemistry absorbs you and leaves you impatient for more.  The movie may be 300 minutes long, but it feels far less.<br />Add in a first-rate supporting cast, vibrant outdoor location scenes, beautiful musical score, and wonderful (and time appropriate!) costumes, and this edition of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" does not miss a step.  I could not begin to recommend it enough.

B00001QGPR|4.0|I've heard many things about this album from all sorts of sources. Many rave on and on about \\"Earthling\\" (a great album to be sure) but then dismiss \\"Hours\\" because it went in a totally new direction. However, that is precisely why I love \\"Hours\\". It takes Bowie's music in a totally new direction, adding one more style to the large Bowie collection. If you're looking for the hard rock Bowie that was Earthling, you won't find it here. However, if you want something soft, soothing, yet still undeniably Bowie, this is for you! There is also something to be said about the multiple references to Bowie's past. It seems that this album and \\"Scary Monsters\\" of 1980 serve as ways for Bowie to let off all that's been building up over the years. Incredibly different, but still good. Now all we have to do is wait for the rumored jazz of \\"Heathen\\"!
B000001FN3|5.0|Only the Project could pull off this poetic fusion.  A steady pulse of rock fades to a melody of sweet, almost classical instrumental before being swept into a passioned frenzy of hard melody supporting the wailful pleas of Poe's lost souls.<br />If you've never bought Alan Parsons before, start with Eye in the Sky which is much more &quot;pop&quot; palatable.  Buy this for your second Alan Parsons album or for a foray into something more adventurous than Top 40.

I'm not crazy about Asimov as a writer (of whose short story this movie is based) but I like most of the plots of his stories.  <br />I love robot stories and so in that to see the transition of the main character (a robot) and his search for others like him as he comes to higher awareness is very interesting.  <br />As a Christian, I find it offensive that anyone could really be taken in by the idea of man making a robot that is clearly supposed to be as human as a human.  <br />However, I suspended my disbelief and enjoyed the pure science fiction of it - I suggest that everyone else do the same and enjoy the movie (but do watch and talk about the movie with your children - good to have them think rather than just decide to avoid it like many have done with Harry Potter another good story).
B00005JKCF|4.0|Go in expecting pure entertainment and unbelivable fantasy and you'll have a great time with Spider-Man. It is funny, exciting, thrilling and (unfortunately) romantic. The only big negative I had was the gratuitous wet t-shirt shot. It just wasn't necessary, and given that this movie will draw a lot of kids it was actually quite tasteless. Outside the first wall climbing sequence which was pathetically bad (obvious wire work), the rest was excellent (albeit obvious CG). Video quality was excellent as well as the 3D sound (especially the voices in the Green Goblin's head at the Mansion).

B00004YRQA|5.0|With the PS2's improvements in graphics, control, and, most importantly, gameplay, it makes sense that Sony would upgrade its console's memory storage to make the gaming experience even better. While the end result is a memory card and not a hard drive, the PS2's memory card is a vast improvement over the PSX's in many aspects.<br />Because the PS2's games require more space to save than a few bytes, the PS2 memory card has 8MB of storage, which is FAR more than the PSX's. But one of the biggest improvements has to be that there are no more \\"blocks.\\" With PSX memory cards, there was a predetermined number of blocks that games were saved in. One game was saved in one block, no matter how small the file was, and this wasted a lot of storage space. With the PS2 memory card, gamers can use ALL of the memory storage space; they can save as many games as they want until the memory card is full. Plus, the PS2 memory card loads data faster than the original PSX card, and if you want to play your saved game on another PS2, all you need is your memory card and the game disc, nothing else.<br />Of course, there is one drawback to the memory card: it's space limitations. While 8MB is quite large, it's still a set amount of space, and hardcore gamers can eat up this space very quickly, which forces them to buy more memory cards. It would've been nice if the amount of space were bigger or if the cards were cheaper.<br />But still, the PS2 memory card is a solid purchase, mainly because it's required to save games on the PS2. While it is a memory card, it does its job better than any other card on the market; other cards, like the infamously bad CD-loading 16MB card and third-party cards, are either a hassle to use or can easily get corrupted and lose data. The 8MB memory card made by Sony Computer Entertainment is the best there is.

I'm not crazy about Asimov as a writer (of whose short story this movie is based) but I like most of the plots of his stories.  <br />I love robot stories and so in that to see the transition of the main character (a robot) and his search for others like him as he comes to higher awareness is very interesting.  <br />As a Christian, I find it offensive that anyone could really be taken in by the idea of man making a robot that is clearly supposed to be as human as a human.  <br />However, I suspended my disbelief and enjoyed the pure science fiction of it - I suggest that everyone else do the same and enjoy the movie (but do watch and talk about the movie with your children - good to have them think rather than just decide to avoid it like many have done with Harry Potter another good story).
0375420525|5.0|I still check behind me sometimes, even when I know there is no one there and I still find myself looking into a shadow in the corner of a room and wondering how deep it really is. You will know why after you read this marvelous work. Danielewski's tale leaves you so scared but yet doesn't allow you to look away. A true delight for anyone looking for a book to leave them breathless and questioning reality. Oh man, I want more. This book is like heroin and a true adrenaline starter. Currently on my third read of the book and now writing notes in the margins. Hope I don't get drawn into it too much...

B00004RFFW|4.0|The second instalment of the popular action franchise is not quite as good as the first, but its still exciting frenetic fun, with some witty humour. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are the partner- in -crime duo again, and this one sees Riggs and Murtaugh joined by Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, the exasperating cop who returns in parts 3 and 4. The action is as impressive as the former one, and director Richard Donner's hard- as-nails approach to the film makes it as exhilarating as it's predecessor.  The DVD's extra features aren't that good, with a couple of trailers and some additional `bonus footage'. But then, the film's good, so the lack of supplementary features isn't that bad. Good movie, so-so extras.

6300214435|4.0|After Raiders, the dream team of George Lucas and Spielberg went for a darker tone with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The sequel (Or prequel, as the film is set before Raiders) is a fun, exciting addition to the Indy franchise. Starting with an excellent opening scene reminiscent of Spielberg's 1941, the film takes off with a string of exciting set pieces (The mine chase scene is the highlight) adding to the film's energetic feel. However it was not well liked by critics when it was first released. Most people complained in relation to the excessive use of (admittedly comic book) violence, and the film's overly dark manner. But in today's world of ultra violence, Temple of Doom isn't that bad, and the fast-paced action scenes make it fun and exciting. The screenplay by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck (Who penned the story for Lucas' \\"American Graffiti\\") is humorous and witty, and Spielberg's comic approach to the film's tone makes it a lot less malicious than some critics assumed. <br />Harrison Ford looks more comfortable in the role as Indy, and while Kate Capshaws' s annoying club singer shtick gets tiresome after a while, she makes a good impression as the love interest for Indy. The film does lack a sufficiently meaty villain, but Harrison's the main guy in this film, and he's excellent. Add John William's heroic score, impressive action and stunt work and you have one of the best action films of all time. Great entertainment.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I found the story and acting to be a little above average, but the DTS surround sound is what makes this a 4 star dvd. What a great disc to show off the surround sound equipment!
6305280711|4.0|Director John McTiernan returned to helm the 3rd part to the Die Hard trilogy, which regains much of the fun action that was missing in Renny Harlin's Die Hard 2. Bruce Willis does the sweaty-vested action hero thing again as John McClane, and to good effect. The main villain, played by Jeremy Irons, is much better than the weak bad guys in DH2, and the inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson makes it even better. Great stunts, action, one-liners, explosions and music. Fine extras too, with a featurette and trailers.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I thought this movie was amazing.The direction by Ron Howard was first rate and the cinematography was amazing. The acting was also top-notch. Russell Crowe was robbed of an oscar, because the Academy decided to make a statement involving African-Americans being the big winners of the night. Jennifer Connely was flawless as John Nash's wife, Alicia and her Oscar was richly deserved.Also, I have to praise Paul Bettany's performance as Charles.I have seen him in several films and always enjoy his work. I have heard complaints directed at the glossing over of less admirable qualities in John Nash's character, but this was a movie. Would your average movie goer want to see a film about an unkind and unfriendly math genius who loses his mind and becomes more unfriendly? If you want this story, read the book, which portrays the darker aspects of Nash's character and does so quite well. If you want an uplifting, sweet movie about a man overcoming great feats, see this movie. If you want the whole story, read the book by Sylvia Nasaar.
6304698658|5.0|One of my favorite Xmas movies!  Clark Griswold wants to have an old-fashioned family christmas, so I'll stand back if i were you.  the laughs come fast and furious in this movie, even the opening animation bit is funny.
B00005JKCF|5.0|At first I use to think Batman(1989) was the best movie based on a comic book and nothing could top it.  Then came X-Men(2000) which is also a great and one of my favorite movies but still wasn't quite as good as Batman but very close.  After watching this movie I have proven myself wrong.  Spider-man topped Batman.  The movie was nothing but excellent.  The acting was great and Tobey Maguire was perfect for the roll as Spider-man.  Special effects were phenominal.  Danny Elfman did great composing the musical score, just as he did in Batman and Beetlejuice.  I did not look away from the movie screen not once.  This movie kept me hooked from the moment the titles began until the ending credits.  I really don't think I have anything bad to say about.  If you haven't already, go see the movie...
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  It is just as exciting to watch it when I was actually there.  There are great shots and the audio is just as great.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I recently saw the Spider-Man movie, and all I can say is Encore Encore.  The acting was superbly done, the action in the fighting scenes really captured what Spider-Man is, and while the digital scenes were slightly fake the overall image left in your mind is one of utter amazement.  Many people say that the story lacked complexity like Training Day or Beautiful Mind.  Well all I have to say is that Spider-Man is not about philosophical emotions or deep thoughts.  It is about ordinary life in which extraordinary things occur.  That is all.  That is what Spider-Man has always been about.  If Sam Raimi had done that then it would have ruined the movie.  Thank God Raimi was faithful to the comic book and did not make it in to something it is not.<BR>Also Tobey was fantastic as Spider-Man I will admit that I had my doubts but after seeing this movie I will no longer doubt that man's talent both with the emotional and physical aspects of acting.  He really brought Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life and made both characters believable.  If I thought that a comic book movie have stood a chance to be nominated for an Academy Award I say the Tobey should get best actor.
B000002KIE|5.0|Personally, I think that &quot;Never Mind...&quot; is more an important album than a really good one.  The album by itself is probably a 4-star piece, but because it influenced so many, it earns a 5.  Sure, the Ramones came first, and the Clash played a more eclectic brand of punk, but the Pistols can be heard in nearly every punk band that has come after them.  The music is raw and sloppy, the lyrics obnoxious, and every song comes together to make the album as punk as possible for '77.  Don't listen to the naysayers, get this CD to see one of the most influential albums in rock music.
B0000009OP|5.0|morphine lives up to its name.  I cannot stop listening to this album.  I am aggravated that I never really knew much about Morphine until recently--Cure for Pain is an amazing, moving album, a sensual experience.  Buena, In Spite of Me and Thursday are fantastic.  It is a shame Mark Sandman died so young.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I am a big fan of the original TIme machine. I believe it to be the first movie I ever saw in a theater.<BR>Fortunately, I didn't go to this move thinking that it would be the classic that the original was. And it wasn't.<BR>This film was very good in it's own right. I suppose that with a little more thought it could have been as good as the George Pal version. It is very hard to re-make a classic and live up to the reputation created in forty years of viewing. At the time of it's release, I don't suppose the original really got much more notice than this version. Perhaps in another forty years or so, this one might be considered a classic too. Can you imagine how difficult it would be to make a new version of \\"The Sound Of Music\\"?<BR>In any case, I gave it four stars for effort. I would have given it five if it had been as good as \\"Batman\\" or \\"The Princess Bride\\".
B00005MAM2|3.0|the picture is amazing and the sound quality is beautiful but i have to disagree with most of these reviews. while i thought the dubbing was well done and the old version's dialogue a bit hokey at times, these new voices just had *no emotion*. especially the colonel. i know im in the minority here but i was the old voices with the dvd quality! <br />i especially missed &quot;just when my coil's reaching the green line!&quot;
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is amazing. From the first few minutes I was hooked.<br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor make such a good due from the way they showed love and the way the sang.<br />I loved the entire backup cast they were just as good as Nicole and Ewan.<br />Set in Paris the story is of a place called Moulin Rouge and how the owner does a show and the star is Nicole Kidman as the girl who will make men want her. Ewan goes to the show to pitch his show that he has done with his friends and gets mistaken as The Duke. He is shown to a room to spend some time with Nicole and there he falls in love with her and can't get her out of his mind.<br />The story is one of beauty and love and has it all.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'm no huge Britney Spears fan, but I know good music when I hear it. And this new Britney CD just happens to statisfy my musicial tastes...<br />1. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" - yes, this track may seem a bit sexy for her a little too mature, but you have to admit it is an awesome dance song! 4/5<br />. \\"Overprotected\\" - one of my personal favorites off the album! Britney gets very personal on this song, and this is a song that a lot of teen girls can relate to 5/5<br />3. \\"Lonely\\" - this song is okay. It's not one that I listen to a lot. But I like the lyrics and the beat is pretty good. 3/5<br />4. \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" - the only ballad on this disc. It proves Britney can sing, and I love the lyrics. Another Britney-gets-personal song. 5/5<br />5. \\"Boys\\" - not one I particularly enjoy, but I really like the main topic of the song! 3/5<br />6. \\"Anticipating\\" - more of an R&B song. I like this one a lot. It is fast-paced and I like the lyrics. 5/5<br />7. \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" - a great Joan Jett remake! I have not heard the original, but Britney's remake of the song is awesome! 5/5<br />8. \\"Cinderella\\" - awesome song! Another one of my personal favorites. I really like the beat and the lyrics are meaningful. I think a lot of people can relate to this song, too. 5/5<br />9. \\"Let Me Be\\" - I don't really like this one. Usually, I skip it. 2/5<br />10. \\"Bombastic Love\\" - it sounds like a song Shaggy would do, and it is alright, but not the greatest. 3/5<br />11. \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" - a good song. I really like the beat and the lyrics are okay. 4/5<br />12. \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" - Britney's ex Justin Timberlake wrote this song along with Wade Robson. I don't really like it...2/5<br />BRITNEY was not my favorite album of the year, but I like it a lot and it deserved my 5 stars. Britney is also not the best singer in the world, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying her funky, upbeat music...
B00005NW02|5.0|This is the most creative and best work of music in 2001. THis is probably more inventive than their first one. Recommended to anybody that like SOAD or a brand new metal fan.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is by far the most underrated movies of 2001. People can say that it is too hard to sit through with all of the extremely deep conversations, but that is the beauty of this film. Not only is this visually breathtaking, it is also meaningful, something so few films strive for. If you like challenging movies, i strongly urge you to watch this amazing film. It is a masterpiece.

6300216268|5.0|Colins Higgin's simple premise and Hal Ashby's subtle direction, coupled with on-target performances illuminates the brilliant use of irony that is lacking in cinema today.  This perfect ying and yang; a young man who has everything,status,wealth and youth is obsessed with death. Contrast him with a woman in her twilight, faded beauty, no visible means of support, living on the fringe but she is obsessed with life. If comedy is derived from conflict then there is plenty of it in this film. I can't urge you enough to watch this movie. It inspires me and makes me laugh.<br />PS, also look for the visual metaphors, like \\"Perma Seal\\" on the coffin or the daisies to tombstones sequence.  Powerful stuff!
B00005YXZH|5.0|With lyrics like,'our love is all of God's money'('Jesus Etc.'),and,'I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a [hoot](My editing of 'Ashes Of American Flags'),you know that you have one diverse cd well worth listening to.The music is so fresh,though,that at first listening I hated it.By my forth playing I was totally converted.This cd is proof that today's music isn't the vast wasteland that MTv and radio makes it out to be.This is the good stuff!If you are one of those who complain about the state of new music-buy this cd:NOW!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|You have read the other reviews here probably, and now you come to mine. Noticed that theres no gray line here? either people love this film or either they hate it. True ,this film is not for everyone. It is however very bold in what it tries to do, sometimes it does pull it off, other times it does not. the story is stereotypical, the dialog not so snappy but its derived from the Orpheus Myth. This film is not for dialog ,or its what may seem very typical story. Any major myth we live with will seem stereotypical ,and this story does here too, but its told very stylistically and through the device of 20th century songs ranging from the pop to the rock to the classics pulls of what it set out to achieve. a modern musical.<BR>dialog? script? go watch lawrence of arabia then.<BR>want a story? go watch citizen kane<BR>want to breathe fresh cinematic air ?,an old air turned new? watch this.<BR>there is a reason myths survive in film strongly,and films last. if you see this from a cliched perspective, you will get a bad perception.<BR>Just let Mr Luhrmann take you through his imagination...and dont let the fast cuts fool you.<BR>Despite its conveying of feelings and story through song, like any myth a movie would be based on. This has layers, you start peeling them and they deepen.<BR>THEn a truly classic movie is made.<BR>any movie that delights critics orgasmically and infuriates the rest like a pungent smell is truly the making of a classic.<BR>dont believe me?<br />take out your cinema history books...or go over the afi top 100 movie list. see how many good movies were panned horribly by some and praised by some.
B000002KYR|4.0|This may have come out during the early days of MTV, but it is still a good c.d.. My only complaint is that my copy has the version of \\"Legs \\" from the 1992 Greatest Hits Collection. It still a good version, but it is not the original. Billy Gibbons must have been experimenting with Rockman guitar gear instead of the same stuff he used for Eliminator. Maybe someone at Aol/ Time Warrner goofed up the remastering and misplaced the master recordings. All of the other songs are the original versions. Billy Gibbons guitar tone cooks throughout<br />the whole album. He playing is awsome. \\"Need you tonight\\"is very<br />underrated
B00003CY0V|4.0|Well, let's sum up the negative reviews of this one:<br />Negative Review Excuse #1<br />\\"Well, this movie jumps around so much, and the plot is so twisty and incoherent that it isn't worth your time to figure it all out.\\"<br />Negative Review Excuse #2<br />\\"Well, it's painfully obvious that this whole film is merely a cobbled together string of gratuitous violence with a few sexy bits added for additional decadent flavor.\\"<br />Well, the truth is that Swordfish does has some twists and turns and does keep you guessing (oh my word, does that mean I have to actually THINK?)  I see this as nothing but positive given Hollywood's penchant for Arnold-esque dumb-as-rocks poor excuses for \\"action\\" films.  If you're too lazy to pay attention then maybe you should be sticking to reality TV and other famous less-than-brain-intensive wastes of American time.<br />Is there violence?  Yes!  By the bucketload!  But it isn't gritty violence, a la Pulp Fiction or Snatch.  It's all very Hollywood cars-flipping-over and heavy-machine-guns-blazing sorta stuff.  The kind of which we've all seen before.  Some of it is actually sort of innovative, or at least a mild positive on the cool-factor scale.  Why we have decided to get all puritanical and start whining against a hallmark of American cinema is beyond me.  It's impressive stuff, I like it.<br />And though the film is good, it's not quite good enough to be considered a \\"classic.\\"  A little too cheesy, a little too slick, and the dialogue is a little too self-conscious to be considered a great critical feat.  But if you're looking for a fun action-type movie, this will hold your attention better than Mission Impossible 2, and has enough lies and deceit (misdirection?) to lower the guilt-factor significantly.<br />It ain't art, it's a movie, and a satisfying one at that.  The self-righteous should just go read a book.
0780020685|4.0|Although vastly different than the asian cinema I usually watch (Jet-Li, Bruce Lee), Seven Samurai still held my interest throughout the entire film.
B00005JKCF|5.0|When I first saw the trailers, I was expecting a decent action movie but not much else. However, this movie surpassed my expectations on many levels. The effects were great, Danny Elfman's music was right on (as usual), and Tobey Maguire really captured the essence of Spider-Man in his performance. I hope the sequel is up to the same level as this picture.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|After reading and hearing so many good reviews about this movie I found myself disappointed at the end of it. Will Smith doesn't even try to remotely sound like Ali, and comes off as very flat. Everything &quot;learned&quot; about Ali in the movie is nothing new unless your very young or have been living in a cave for the past 40 years. Also, it is diffult to believe that Smith would really stand a chance against the actors who played Liston, Foreman, Fraiser, or even Chuck Wepner. As for positives, Jamie Foxx steals every scene he's in as Drew &quot;Bundini&quot; Brown; but that's about it.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I got suckered into buying another Wilco album. I thought I had bailed for good after 'being there'. But all the critics were saying this was Tweedy's return to Tupelo style, so I bought it. Wrong again. This is more overproduced [junk] from Tweedy & co. Why Tweedy wants to be Sgt. Pepper/Brian Wilson is beyond me. Or is it that...band that keeps putting that spin on Tweedy's music? Another $[money] down the drain. No more Wilco..Over and out.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I thought it would bo difficult to find a worse movie than &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Natural Born Killer&quot;. Yes, I found that &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is comparably bad. <br />I cannot believe that I just wasted my time and my money to be confused by a movie such as this (I have my husband to confuse me already!). I truly believe that the movie stars who gave great review for this movie were just being so sarcastic and full of revenge. They wanted as many people as possible to suffer the way they did.

B00003CXXP|1.0|I was very dissapointed by this movie. It started out okay, but then it dragged on and on. It was so stupid and pointless. The only good character in the movie that I cared about was Teddy! He was so cute and funny. Anyway, don't rent or buy this movie becuase it is a waist of your time and money.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|...Michael Mann's stirring adaptation of the Muhammad Ali saga is all common fallacy of appeal to force and circular reasoning.  It ponders the all-too familiar cons of the struggling boxer, who is of course waiting to make it to the top (The Hurricane, Rocky).  \\"Ali\\", despite its truthful references, is a grip-n-go satire of relationship, violence, and sports, ultimately leading up to the Final Fight of victory when Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali faces big-boy George in the ring.<br />The purpose of bringing up circular reasoning and appeal-to-force with \\"Ali\\", is that the movie is focused more on the immitations and recreations of Ali's struggles and preparation for the fights.  It presents well when Will Smith is voicing the champ and portraying the right actions.  Other than the facial tissue, we are left with a brick wall.  Where is the emotion?  Where is the greatful side?  Where is the smile?  There are many installments of Ali's womanizing complications, his Muslim road of life, his neglection, and even his courtroom detour of possible imprisonment after refusal of fighting in the Vietnam War; great- but why is everything about his major struggles?  Weren't there issues in his time where he would sit back and smile because of them?  \\"Ali\\" never gives us a proven example, and the film forces us to withstand the vision of Michael Mann and the band of screenwriters that produced this biopic sling-shot.<br />Will Smith is the real champ here, doing his duties as an actor- making a legendary performance as Muhammad Ali.  His words, his movements, his feel are all on the mark.  The mere fact that his participating in this film deserves well praise alone will sustain his career for at least five years.  His Oscar nomination was no surprise and was well deserved.  He drives this drama where otherwise it could not have gone.  However, this just isn't the right movie.  This isn't \\"Ali\\".  This is an exterior figure of Ali \\"The Champ\\".  Where is the interior substance?<br />Jada Pinkett-Smith, Oscar Nominee- Jon Voight, and Jamie Foxx also co-star.  Voight also received an Academy Award Nomination for his supporting performance as Howard Cosell- one I think was uncalled for.  His face is pure plastic and make-up.  His texture works for the film, but it isn't anything magnificent.  If this is the case, I'd rather give Voight an Oscar for his supporting performance as President Roosevelt in \\"Pearl Harbor\\", where is face was again revised to reveal a stunning image of old Franklin.<br />To give \\"Ali\\" the benefit of the doubt, I will say that Will Smith and many cast members worked marvelously.  It isn't the faults of the stars.  It is the story that is corrupted with elongated sequences of boredom and neglection, overrunning the fact that is traveling too far, and yet not getting deep enough.  The scenes that needed more depth went quickly, and the less important scenes (mainly exercises) seemed to go on for a long time.  <br />For the emptiness I left the film with, I'm going to give it a Thumbs Down.  There are means to its prescence, and there are those points where it is as if they're meaningless.  \\"Ali\\" is the pure example of a fighter- but it comes off as neither champion nor engaging by any means.<br />** 1/2 of 4...
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow. That sums it up. Just wow. I've been a Spider-Man fan for years and this movie just blew me out of the water. The special effects were amazing. The scenes where Spidey was swinging through the city were intense, exactly how it should be. The movie was casted perfectly . . . Tobey Maguire was the prefect Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst the perfect MJ, Willem Defoe the perfect Green Goblin. The movie captured the Spider-Man essense a lot better than I think anybody thought it would. Yes, some things were changed, for example it was a genetically altered spider instead of a radioactive spider that bites Peter Parker, but all the changes were made to keep up with the times. I saw the Spider-Man first day, having to scramble for late night tickets after all the earlier shows were sold out. The atmosphere was great, first day, everybody excited about the movie, and it lived up to the hype. The movie had something for everybody, since it wasn't an full-blown action movie, neither was it an all-out drama. Many of the scenes are hilarious because they're supposed to be funny and other scenes just got me laughing because I was giddy with excitement. Without giving away too much, I like how the movie focused a lot on Peter Parker's life and not just the Spider-Man side of the story. It tells the story of how an ordinary person, Peter Parker, nerd and school paper photographer, becomes thrusted into extraordinary circumstances. The story almost becomes believable and with the incredible special effects it makes the movie the best adventure escapist film ever. Walking out of the theater I felt how Peter Parker felt and I wanted to be Spider-Man. There was one thing that struck me as wrong, however. The Green Goblin's suit. I know I just finished saying how the story had been tweeked to correspond with modern day life, and I guess the Goblin's techno suit is one of those tweekings, but I didn't like it. I think they should've kept the original mask, costume and cape of the original Green Goblin. But never mind my haggling, just go see the movie, it's definitely worth your money. Add your eight bucks to the [money] it made first weekend (that's a record you know).<BR>Just go see Spider-Man. Now.
6303942830|5.0|This is a very good movie set during the French and Indian War.  The movie captures the essence of the time and the growing independent attitude of the colonists.  Strong characters abound in this movie and play off each other very well.  The battle scenes are intense and the growing love between Cora and Hawkeye is engrossing.  <br />The backdrop of this film and the mountains that it occurs in are unbelievably beautiful.  The musical score along with the visual depications are very pleasing to the senses.  I enjoyed the music so much, I bought the soundtrack too.  The final scene climaxes in a way that will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat.    <br />The only fault I could find in this movie was that while watching it, time seemed to pass too quickly.  It ran less than 2 hours and I would have liked more, but what I got was great!  I highly recommend this movie.
B00003CXDB|5.0|An all too accurate depiction of the way Wall St. works. Anyone who's watched his hard earned money disappear on some broker's lame recommendation while the rich get richer will feel right at home here. The story of an ambitious young broker (Charlie Sheen) who wants it all right now. He gets his wish but discovers that there are some lines he will not cross. Michael Douglas got the oscar but the whole cast is excellent.
6303109950|5.0|It is not the story that makes this movie it is the performances.  The story of the Earp's, the Clanton's and Tombstone is a legend of the old west.  It is the performances in this movie that make it shine.  And it really shines!  An instant classic that all future westerns will be judged against.  And the first western capable of standing side by side with &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.  <br />A star studded cast was brought together for this movie including Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Powers Booth, Dana Delany, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Jason Priestley, Billy Zane and Charlton Heston.  Each actor casted to perfection.  The camera angles, the cinematography and the dialogue are exceptional. <br />If you don't own any western, this should be your first.  Sit back and enjoy the legend of the Earp's and Doc Holliday.
B000000OMB|4.0|Asia is the grandest superband on earth. But why Asia? They tried to show that this is no traditional British progressive rock nor American progressive hard rock and it lies somewhere between. Heat of the Moment, Only Time Will Tell, Sole Survivor are super-excellent. Particularly interim keyboard bridge part of Soul Survivor has been embedded in my memory for so long. Rest of the tracks are very dynamic as well and showing the longtime legacy of British prog a bit. John Wetton's clear voice is another of the band's appeal. Recommended for wide range of melodic rock and progressive rock fans who may like Dream Theater.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I first bought Rolodex Propoganda when it came out on 7&quot; in the UK. It blew me away, but it also took me 2 years to buy the whole album.<br />You will hear nothing better. If you don't own it you're missing out.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Not recommending this movie just because you don't like the way Spiderman looks while swinging with his webs is the stupidest thing I ever heard of. If you read Ebert's review or saw his show recently then you know what I'm talking about. For one thing I think those scenes with him web slinging look flawless. Even if it looked totally [bad] I still wouldn't give the film a bad review because of it.  Sam Raimi (Darkman, Army of Darkness) does a fantastic job of bringing Spiderman to life on the big screen. Raimi who is a big fan of Spiderman himself was perfect to direct this movie and I hope he directs each  and every sequel because no one is better for the job. I was a big fan of the Cartoon show in the 90's and everything I loved about is here.<br />  I was a little surprised that Newsday which is usually picky and loves giving low ratings actually gave it ****, I didn't expect such a high rating at all.  After seeing the movie I understand why though. It has everything, action, romance comedy and drama. It's the perfect date movie too I must add. The action scenes are incredible for one thing, the movement's quick and if you blink you might miss something but to me that's what made it fun. Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst are just adorable together, they share a lot of cute and heart warming scenes. Tobey's perfect in this movie, enjoyed his performance so much that I wouldn't mind seeing him get an oscar nomination. He has so much to overcome in this movie and each and every feeling he shows...you believe.  That's how good he is.<br />  William Dafoe is also very good as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. An experiment gone wrong creates this split personality for him which drives him completely insane. Although he wears this Green Goblin costume and raises hell with glider inside he's still a decent man that has a love for his son who he has been too busy for a lot of the time. It puzzles me how Raimi manages to throw all these things together so nicely in just a 2 hour movie. What are you waiting for check out this movie, trust me it's probably the best comic book movie ever made \\"yes even better than Superman and X-Men\\".hour movie.

B00005JKCF|5.0|My family and I went to see the new Spiderman movie, and we all really enjoyed the movie. I am not really into comic book movies and the Superman movie series really did not impress me, but this movie got my attention and it held me during the whole movie. Sam Ramie really did justice to Peter Parker, and all the other characters. I will not tell you what the movie is about, you will just have to see the movie and enjoy it for it is. My family also enjoyed the movie so I know its a keeper. Found out that a sequel is in the works. I also enjoyed small appearences by Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimie, and Bruce Campbell all the stars of the Hercules and Xena series that were hits. See this movie, you will be glad that you did.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this movie.  It had something for everyone.  Family values,  a love story, and lots of fun action.  I took my 8 year old son which I was leary of because of the PG-13 rating.  It was acceptable to me.  There was one swear used ..., which he knows is wrong to use.  The violence was actually less than some of the cartoons on TV.  <br />I highly recommend this movie!
B000000WCV|5.0|Daft Punk is a great musical journey.  The beats are great.  This is music great for parties of all types.
B00005JKCF|5.0|What can I possibly say but WOW!  This movie is truly a dream come true for a long time Spider-man fan like me. Not only was the movie made but the movie was made RIGHT!<br />Many directors and artists in Hollywood claim to be fans of comic book heroes, but when it comes time for them to actually put it together they fail miserably. But not here. Sam Rami is a TRUE Spider-man fan-- and he did what a true fan would do. He stayed true to the source and to the material. He captured the essence of Spider-man and his history. He didn't decide to pretentiously add his own mark like Tim Burton did with the laughable Batman movie. Rami stayed true to the comic.  This is the Spider-man I read about month for the last 13 years.<br />I really did not think that anyone could top the X-Men, but Rami has and I don't just mean because of the special effets.  I also mean in terms of the plot and character development. This is not a long drawn out  movie filled with pointless violence.  It is a well plotted story that moves effortlessly from point to point. Who would have thought that so much could be fit into two hours?  And the end, I won't give it away , but who on earth would have thought that it would have ended that way. Instead of going for the same old boring  cliche Hollywood ending--Rami tacks on an original one which hints towards the future.<br />Tobey Maguire was not my first choice to play Peter Parker. But boy does he deliver! I understand that he worked hard to get this part and boy does it show! He plays Peter just the way he was portrayed in the book! Kristen Dunst also was excellent,I did not think that she could pull off the part of Mary Jane. She's a lovely girl but not the super-model that MJ is in the comic book. But I was pleasantly surprised with what was done with the character.<br />After being disapointed with the unseeminly endless rubish that Hollywood has produced lately I am now, in the words of Mr. Stan Lee, a true believer. Thanks Sam Rami for not butchering a character I consider to be like a brother and restoring my faith that there are film makers out there who actually care about film making!butchering a character I consider to be like a brother and restoring my faith that there are film makers out there who actually care about film making!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Ive been a fan of No Doubts music ever since I heard just a girl on the radio in 95. There was something about that singer in the band. After enjoying \\"just a girl I quickly rushed out and bought TRAGIC KINGDOM, not knowing that it would be a massive success. Anyway Ive been a fan ever since and ROCK STEADY doesnt disappoint. Sure, its way different than anything No Doubts ever done before but its called GROWTH people! You cant expect a band to keep putting out the same old music with each new album.<br />That being said ROCK STEADY was a nice surprise for me. I think its their best work since TRAGIC KINGDOM. RETURN OF SATURN was a too dull and too serious for this band. This CD is more up-beat, fun, and as Gwen puts it; its called being in a good mood. Thats exactly what youll get with this album. The music is a little looser and Gwens lyrics are a bit more clever and fun. ROCK STEADY even incorporates (dare I say it) some 80s flair on tracks like hella good, making out and dont let me down. <br />No Doubt is best known for their signature rock/ska sound. Now theyve taken out most of the rock and brought in more reggae/dance-hall arrangements on songs like hey baby, underneath it all and start the fire. ROCK STEADY pops more than it rocks but theres still one rock number here. Platinum blonde life sounds like a RETURN OF SATURN outtake. Surprisingly its one of the weaker tracks on here. <br />Start to finish, ROCK STEADY delivers. Think of it as No Doubt having a good time after the slump of RETURN OF SATURN. Gwen, Tony, Tom, and Adrian havent lost it, theyve just channeled their creative sound into a more fun, up-beat, easy-going, place. I really like this CD and its defiantly one that you can play without skipping any tracks. Weather poppin or rockin, this CD is awesome.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I guess that the only problem with Spider Man is that it needs to be viewed on the big screen with that heart pounding DTS. Even on DVD Widescreen, it still won't be the same. It was visually average, while the sound was out of this world. It was EXCELLENT!<br />I sat in the front row, and it was incredible. I LOVED THE FILM. Great acting, lovely script, and the director of photograpy deserves a noteable mention. I did not expect this to be half of what it was. Shame on me!
B00005B36H|5.0|Listening to Tool has always been like an ethereal autopsy. Slowly and subtle the layers of skin, body fat and muscle peel away until the core is finally reached, gorged out and left for celestial decomposition. Jeremy Irons summed it up best in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers: &quot;There should be a beauty contest for people's insides...&quot; Five years in the making, this colossal piece of brooding intensity has Tool swimming in new oceans while creating those dense layers of viciously dreamy pageantry that the band have been known for. Structurally, this thing is unbelievable; where it painlessly carves you up in the first half, until it reaches the mid-section where it ultimately strikes (the &quot;this will hurt just a bit&quot; part) and finally finishing you off in such a way that by the end of the album, you're floating, somewhat suspended, just like the feeling you get after listening to Farewell To Kings or Hemispheres. Tool had already taken the rulebook and drowned it with Aenima but Lateralus just takes that extra lunge into innerspace. 'Schism' is practically the most accessible song musically, along with the elusive cries of 'Parabol' while the dauntingly tearing and abrasive title track, the brutal hypnotism of 'Ticks &amp; Leeches' and the exotic-progressive grasp of 'Reflection' seem to attack in a subdued way like a smoothly sharpened knife would glide into flesh. How much sublimity can be found within, one can only guess, but if the climax of this album, 'Faaip De Oiad', is anything, it has to be the most disturbing way to end an album, ever. Musically speaking, each instrument is its own voice: the tribal, psychedelic percussive rhythms, the progressive but deadly guitar ambience, Justin Chancellor's haunting bass vibes and, the flesh that coats the muscle: the vocal baptism of Maynard James Keenan. Of course it would be fair to mention that Tool have also once again re-defined the essence of progressive music, a merciless display of stream ofconsciousness, and they might as well be the new King Crimson. Never before have I heard an album that slithers as one surreal continuum, that takes a hold with such delicate measures and care, making this the most magical listening experience since Ritual De Lo Habitual. Once again rock will never be the same.<BR>Long live rock.
B0000636UN|5.0|I'm smitten.  I loved every track.  Sometimes, you're favorite artist comes out with a new album that sounds just like the last one, and that's ok.  Sometimes they come out with an album that is so advanced musically that it can take you years to like it.  And sometimes, they produce an album that makes your heart and soul just sing with instant classics.  That's what C'mon C'mon did for me.  Right from the first track, my foot started tapping and my body started rocking, and I didn't stop until the end of the album.  Thank you Ms. Crow.  Thank you for another wonderful contribution to the world.
B000003KMM|5.0|Major League, the first installment of three Major League movies, is by far, the funniest and most original.  It's an 80's gem.  First off, like many other classics on my list (Spinal Tap,eg), this is a movie my wife didn't think was funny.  Perhaps a gender issue, I don't know, but I found Major League to be original and entertaining.  It's not fast paced or one joke after another, rather it's more subtle humor (again Spinal Tap comes to mind).<br />You can read the other review to get the story line.  I'm telling you that it's a top-10 pick for me.
B00005NP04|5.0|When I heard &quot;Valentine&quot;played on the radio years ago,with Jim Brickman.I was hooked on this fantastic  song,&quot;If there were no words,no way to speak,I would still hear you.&quot; This has got to be the number 1 love song of all time.So last week while going through the new CD's,I found Martina McBride's greatest Hits.I HAD TO GET THIS RECORD.I put on the first track,&quot;My Baby Loves Me,&quot; and I said to myself,&quot;OH MY GOD,She's a country singer.&quot; I had no idea.I was wondering why I haven't heard more of Martina's music played on the radio,but I don't listen to country stations.After playing this CD for a week,I'm still not a huge fan of the sound,but I am a fan of this wonderfull singer.&quot;There you are,Where would you be,Independence Day,Concrete Angel,&quot; and the clossing number,&quot;Blessed,&quot; are my other favorite's.This CD is like hearing 2 different artist.One, a great Country singer,and the other,a top 40  voice, equal to Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion.I have been &quot;Blessed&quot; finding this Greatest Hits CD from Martina McBride.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Though it seems like people have picked and picked at The Strokes, I simply think that after a listen, one will forget about the hype and just love the music.  It has some awesome songs, like &quot;Soma&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot;.  Appreciate the music, because it is wonderful music
B00005O3VC|5.0|As an owner of the original &quot;welfare&quot; DVD version of this film, I was very impressed with this special edition. Not only were there *tons* of extras and plenty of commentary by all the living Pythons, the quality of the feature itself was absolutely stunning! For those who know the movie and have only seen the other home versions of the film, the scene with Dennis the Peasant is the first real shock in this edition. The grass is *so* green! I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was cleaned up so well. Even the people who have &quot;sh!t all over them&quot; look clean.<br />Unlike many of the other reveiwers of this movie, I didn't experience any difficulties with the subtitles at any point during the feature. On the subject of subtitles, someone had some fun going back and subtitling it with a farcical Shakespearean play for &quot;people who don't like the movie.&quot; It is truly a great treatment of one of the best satirical films of all time. This is not just a Special Edition, it's a SPECTACULAR Edition!
1573226521|2.0|The upshot of this Gen-X reworking of &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; and &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; is that civilization is good for you so don't even THINK of trying to escape, because you'll only end up in the madness and despair that is the true legacy of human nature and the human heart.  And since that's the case, don't bother about politics, either, because you'll just wind up in the same state.  Thanks, Margaret Thatcher in drag.  This thickly plotted (and therefore contrived) adventure story had a built-in audience among the backpacker set but really has nothing to say.  Mild entertainment value.
B000002HH2|4.0|This was the first albums I bought from Bjork.  I find it her most chaotic, with each song being different to the next.  My favorite songs are: &quot;Army of Me&quot;, &quot;HyperBallad&quot;, &quot;Isobel&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;.  I specially love &quot;Hyperballad&quot;.  It's one of Bjork's finest songs.
0345440900|5.0|I was given so many, many, many books to read by friends while I was pregnant. After reading and reading, I was so overwhelmed with conflicting thoughts that I found myself beginning to panic.  I longed for easy and organized information that was centered more on getting to know my baby.  Thankfully, I found this book while I was 10 days postdue and waiting to be induced.<br />I was moved from day one by this author, and FINALLY a book about connecting with my baby.  This book was full of sensible information that steered toward the middle ground and basically explained in easy reading all of my confusions and questions from the previous books that I had read.<BR> <BR>I was so tired of all the controversy over the right and wrong methods and I really felt this author emphasized flexability,and nurturing for not only the baby but the parent.   <br />That is why after reading the book three times, I was so surprised to read some of the reviews on Amazon. I'm not sure if some of the reviewers actually read the entire book.<BR> <BR> If anything this book is refreshing and the author gives so many examples of how to implement her strategies for different parenting types.  She fully acknowledges in a quiz,that all parents and situations are different, and she gives so many examples of different cases. She is an advocate for diversity among parents with different backgrounds and situations.<br />I found that like most nurses in this field, Tracey used her book to speak to me more as a person who is longing for the connection and understanding of the non-verbal language of their new born. Unlike the M.D. who is there to flaunt crudentials and tell me how there is only one right way (their way) to foster infant development. <br />THIS is a great supplement to your new parent collection and I highly recommend it.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down starts out with a brief introduction into the U.S. involvement in Somalia, and then takes us on a journey through hell!  <br />This movie tells the true story of Task Force Ranger, who were sent to Somalia to put an end to the clan warfare and capture the most powerful warlord in the impoverished African nation.  What was supposed to be a routine mission, turned into a fierce 18 hour battle that claimed the lives of 18 American servicemen and resulted in another 73 being wounded.  <br />This movie does not \\"Hollywood\\" the story at all because it simply did not need to.  The story itself was shocking, tragic, and in many senses triumphant.  It was an event that very few people in this country knew about at the time.  Mark Bowden's book was exceptionally written and the movie follows it extremely well.<br />Be aware...This movie is not for the faint of heart!  It depicts the battle in graphic detail and contains scenes of some very gruesome injuries sustained by the men involved.  There is one scene where a medic is fighting to save the life of a wounded soldier who has a severed artery in his leg.  This is one of the most graphic sequences you will see in a film, so be prepared.<br />Ridley Scott turned in another brilliant job of directing.  He successfully puts the audience into the fight and allows us to feel the hopelessness and despair that was felt by these brave men.  He tells the story of this battle with exceptional detail and realism.  You will be left with a mix of emotions after watching this film, but you will also feel a deep sense of thanks and gratitude for the men and women who are serving our country today.<br />Black Hawk Down is one of the best films in recent years and should not be missed!
0553801481|4.0|I've been reading Robin Hobb since she was Megan Lindholm (and now recognised as such); her early books were aimed at a younger audience, but had that certain appeal that set her apart from the run-of-the-mill authors. <BR>The Six Duchy saga is on a different plane, appealing to a more mature audience who wish something to get their imaginations' teeth imto, and she has done it again with the Tawny Man - although it doesn't seem like it during the first 1/3rd of the book ... <BR>15 years have passed since Fitz's last adventure (he is now known as Tom), so the telling of this has to be done subtly, to avoid those boring resumes that we often get; the Fool too has changed in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways and seems intent on being as manipulative as Chade. <BR>The threads that are brought together during the latter part of the book promise an adventure just as good as the other 2, especially as we seem to be drawing both previous series to a common point (which may have been guessed at from the previous frontispiece maps).<br />There are many unanswered questions as well: who or what is the Fool &amp; is it male or female? Where does Hap fit in? Starling is more than she appears; Why is the Fool's horse called Malta? Treasure Beach hints at another connection; Wit &amp; Skill - same or different?<br />By the end of the book, one is left wondering which will be next - a further episode of Tawny Nan, the Liveship Traders sequel, or a new series about the OutIslanders?<br />Ms Hobb has fashioned one of the most believable worlds in modern fantasy - on a par with George RR Martin's Song of Ice &amp; Fire - the characters are 3-dimensional, hidden traits appearing unexpectedly, and not all of them perfect, as so often happens in lesser tales.<br />I can't say much more without 'spoilers', so I leave it to you to persevere with the first part of the book, your persistance will be rewarded!
B00005JKCF|5.0|When I first heard that Sony Pictures were going to make a film based on the comic-book superhero Spider-Man, I was in shock. This was great! But-- this was three years ago, even before they casted Tobey Maguire and have even wrote the script. Everyday, I went on Upcomingmovies.com to find out more about the film and eventually, I learned more and more and more. After two months approximately, they casted Tobey Maguire. Then they were after the Green Goblin. Finally, Willem Dafoe is casted. Then Kirsten Dunst, then J.K Simmons, and so on and so forth. So you see, I have been waiting for this movie even before they wrote the script. And now, I finally, after nearly three years, I have seen a dream.<br />Spider-Man for one is now my most favorite movie. Sam Raimi delivers a great, action-packed movie with a story actually behind it (unlike any Rambo movie). The acting is marvelous except for Kirsten Dunst. I wished they picked another actress to play the part of Mary Jane Watson. But of course, the film has its weaknesses and down-falls, but fortunately, those glitches are minor and just flow by like air. In some points of the film, the movie seems to long but always, in these types of movies, you want more and more and more. The story is over-all great, not good-- GREAT! Whoever wrote the script knew the original story written by Stan Lee, took it another step further transforming a masterpiece...If you are a Spider-Man fan, you are there, if you are a superhero fan, you are still there, and even if you are an Archie Comics fan, you are there. This film is the most action-packed and truthfull comic book movie that has ever been made...
B00005JKDR|5.0|this was the best movie, it not only was funny but very sweet and adorable.<BR>This is a movie that can be enjoyed by young and old a like and I would recommend this movie to anyone!
6304994540|5.0|This is the most important film by the Cohen brothers -- lazy afternoon with hillarius scenes and the most funny one liners I have heard delivered without a twitch in the corner of the mouth -- it's Cult, Man! .. and with Jeff Bridges as -- ahh, well, Jeff Bridges; he's a marvelous laid-back character and a wonderfull actor .. he never seems to stop to amaze me with his talent. And everybody -- including the Cohen's -- is having af wonderfull time; you can tell, can't you? I can't stop seeing it -- it's a virus, and I love it ;-)
0446677450|1.0|I can't understand the popularity of this book, and the string of exploitative titles that came after it.  The so-called financial advice is simplistic and obvious, presented in poor to average writing and laughably unconvincing anecdotes.<br />I'm sorry I bought it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|In the short time it has been out I have seen Spider-man twice.  It is my all time favorite movie.  The actors did an exellant job.  The fight scenes were incredible especially the slugfest at the end.  The plot was great and was very close to the comic.  So if you like the comic or just like a great movie go see it now.
B00005JKJA|4.0|The only biographical data on David Lynch, if you look him up in the Cast and Crew section of this DVD, is \\"Eagle Scout\\".  This cryptic bio is relevant precisely because of its terse irony and apparent irrelevance.<br />The film itself is (on the surface, at least) about another Eagle Scout-type -- a chirpy, aw-shucks young Canadian woman who comes to Hollywood with stars in her eyes -- only to find a dingy underbelly of ... studio executives, scary homeless people, and seedy lowlifes.  The girl (whose very name is suspect), beautifully played by Naomi Watts, floats in the rippling California sunshine like Lynch's Jungian Anima in a lucid fever-dream.  Everything seems just a little too scrubbed-clean and cheerful.  The happier the first parts of the film got, the greater the dread that developed in the pit of my stomach.<br />True to form, Lynch pulls the rug out in a bravura third-act that calls everything that has come before it into question.  This goes beyond some funky narrative sleight-of-hand trick (as pulled by such recent films as The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects); it forces us to confront the sad, desperate acts of self-deception necessary for a young actress to survive mentally, once she has become ... used by the  Hollywood Beast.<br />There are many plot strands that seem, at first, to go nowhere.  There is the amnesiac actress (the amazing Laura Elana Harring) who was saved from an apparent mob hit by a fortuitous car accident.  The mystery of her identity and circumstance is the springboard for most of the film.  Then there is the disillusioned film director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) - apparently a caricature of Lynch himself - who is forced by mob-types to cast a certain actress in the lead part of his film.

6300214435|5.0|Indiana Jones and his two companions (Kate Capshaw and his kid partner, Short Round) are in search of three sacred stones in the jungles of India, which leads them to a deadly cult literally living underground. The weakest of the Indiana Jones series, Temple of Doom suffers from weaker villains, a weaker setting, and just plain weaker artifacts. But not to fret, the opening and closing half-hours feature two of the better action sequences in memory, a shootout in a Chinese restaurant that builds to a car chase through the streets of Shanghai all the way to a plane flying out of control over the Himalayas(!) and a wildly frenetic non-stop rollercoaster finale. Add in the great humor (love the dinner and bug scenes), Harrison Ford's highly charismatic performance, and you've got yourself a rollicking adventure. Yep, this one's still a great thrill ride.
B00005T30L|5.0|&quot;Ghost World&quot; is one of those movies that manages to leave you feeling unworthy of writing a review of it. It is one of those quiet little movies that get some attention from the more clever reviewers, but in the realm of big-budget blockbusters gets virtually ignored. It is quirky, smart and utterly fabulous. It is not only emotionally true to itself, but it never loses its edge. <br />Thora Birch positively shines in the role of Enid, a newly-highschool graduated girl who has to take an art [her passion] class over again because of a failing grade. She and her best friend Rebecca have spent their lives ridiculing and loathing the &quot;normal&quot; people, the living terrors that are happy all the time and wave goodbye with both hands simultaneously. <br />As the summer progresses, the girls start to go their seperate ways, Rebecca becoming comfortable in her new job and slowly becoming &quot;normal&quot;. Enid has made friends with a middle aged man [Steve Buscemi] who's life-long passion is music, and together they start to look for a suitable match for him. <br />As much as I do not like to use the term, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a coming-of-age story at its best: two girls who are at the beginning of the rest of their lives start developing and becoming what they will eventually be. A beautiful and wonderfully made film that I highly recommend seeing.
0792157869|5.0|Indiana Jones and his father (played to pitch perfection by Sean Connery) are on the search for the cup of Christ, and are once again in a race with the Nazis for this prized artifact.  Third and probably final adventure in this popular series is the best of the bunch, a smart, funny rollercoaster ride of thrilling action sequences and amazing stunts.  Kudos to Steven Spielberg for delivering the ultimate popcorn movie.  Harrison Ford is once again superb as the titular hero, proving he was born for the role.
B000009FHN|5.0|I bought this disc as it was what I was looking for since it also had the cover of Joy Division's Dead Souls.  This album is one of my favorites the reason your paying X amount for the Japanese import is because the Japanese use different pressing technique to the Americans so you get a better sound quality.  Normally if there is a bonus tracks its put at the end beats me why dead souls is track 10 but then again thats what the program button on your Cd player is for so you CAN put the song at the end if you so desire.  If you decide you WANT to buy this I'd hurry cause it may go up in price in the near future.  This is a disc you can chill out to cause its that good!!!!!!
0201485672|5.0|Regardless of whether you adopt each and every one of the recommended practices, this book clearly and concisely presents each concept with simple examples, UML diagrams, and good explanations of the pros and cons of performing each refactoring, as well as when to use them.  These are great techniques to add to your toolset as an object-oriented programmer.<br />Be aware that as defined by the book, refactoring means changing a program without altering the behavior of the program (&quot;Improving the design of existing code.&quot;)  Refactoring is essential for any software that must be maintained or upgraded, so this book can be a great aid to anyone who works with code.<br />As a Gang of Four affiliated book, it uses the concept of patterns and a catalog to efficiently present material.  It also uses the concept of &quot;smells&quot; of code to bridge intuition and best practices.<br />Overall, a worthwhile read.
6305013578|2.0|I am a huge film fanatic, not to mention a big sci-fi fan...Horrible DVD transfer. The music soundtrack that was just slaped on is ridiculous, but Metropolis is Film History. Probably the first real science fiction film ever made, if you ever see it as it was ment to (check out local film art houses, and if they have an original Wurlitzer Organ playing along like they do at \\"The Tampa Theater\\" so much the better), you would see that it is one of the greatest films ever made.

Oasis, Radiohead, Ash, Travis, Stereophonics, Pulp.... This being the best album to come out in 2000 period. It just leaps out at you, melancholy, yet deepful. It can brong you up on tracks like shiver, and quickly bring you back down on Don't panic. Yes, it is a rollercoaster that will grab you by the [neck] and bring you once around the block. ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY BUY BUY
B00000AFWW|5.0|I never thought that Courtney Love would be my one of my new favorite artist. But after one listen to Celebrity Skin I was hooked. This is Great Rock and Roll (Which is why you probably won't hear it on the radio). I understand that Courtney is having problems with her current record company in supporting this album. So it is up to us, &quot;The Fans&quot; to show them what they are about to lose. Support Courtney Love and buy this great albumn
0312243022|5.0|My husband, also a writer, urged me to read this.  I put it off for a while.  We're big readers and fans of James Salter, who I compare Cunningham to.  Like Salter (Light Years was my favorite of his), his use of language is poetry, his characters so fully developed that they seamlessly become part of your psyche.  He brought together in a profound way three wonderful women (tragic, self-effacing and just plain damaged) that I feel have become part of my life; enriching it, making me think and feel like I didn't know I could.  I can't wait to see Cunningham read and when I do, I intend to tell him The Hours is on my top ten of all-time favorite books.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Okay, now how do I describe this film? Um, no that's not right. Perhaps? no not quite right, Oh I know, IT'S DAVID LYNCH!! Just see it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|The movie was really good! The special effects were a mix between \\"Charlie's Angels\\" and \\"The Matrix\\". The storyline was really good. The romance part of the story was a little weak but oh well. You can definetly sense a sequel (although I already knew there was one coming).
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are pure genius.  A wave of bland punk bands have come, but the Strokes is the only one that is really good.  Their music is put together and who could deny those good looks? Julian's voice is worth it alone.  I hope rock takes a new turn and follows what the Strokes are doing, with a fresh new sound, but less hype would help.
0141301155|5.0|Raold Dahl is a true star of Children's Literature.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a singular delight, crammed with mad fantasy, childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat. Willy Wonka opens the gate of his Chocolate Factory to the five 'Lucky Winners' who finds the golden ticket wrapped in a Wonka Chocolate. Charlie is poor and gets only one Chocolate bar a year! One day he finds a dollar bill in the snow and buys himself a chocolate bar. Luck favours him as this contains the fifth golden ticket. The fantasy tour of Charlie begins with the other four winners - Mike Teaves who lives for TV, Veruca Salt, a brat who lives with bratty parents, Violet Beaguragarde, a girl who love gum and Augustus Gloop who would just eat anything! Dahl portrays incidents with resourcefulness and humour. Violet blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing gum and Agustus Gloops is carried away on the river of chocolate he would not resist. They have great Adventures and in the end, Wonka gives a big 'Surprise' to Charlie.<br />This is an all time Dahl Classic for all Ages.<br />'Choice Pick' - Especially for 8-12 years:-)
B00004X0ER|3.0|First of all, I have to say that not any of the guitar work is original sounding.  Every song sounds like a reworked version of the same old thing.  The one song I really like is &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot; because of its fun sound, but I'm sorry, the Strokes are better.  I give them credit, though, for the lyrics.  But don't fluff this album up with praise, it would spoil it.  The Hives are not the rock-savior though, I'm not sure anyone can save the bland new punk-rock now.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I fell in love with Ella many years ago when I heard her do an all Gershwin concert with Arthur Fiedler and The Boston Pops in Symphony Hall.I've fallen in love with jazz all over again when I listen to this album, and hear you sing \\"The Nearness Of You\\". You are a treasure! I hope I can get to hear you perform some day at Symphony Hall or at Tanglewood
B000003CMB|5.0|The Allman Brothers were master musicians, everyone well agrees.  They wrote good enough songs, but their studio albums are for the most part quite good but not spectacular.  There are a few occasions when they open up instrumentally, like in \\"Mountain Jam,\\" and within limits on some shorter songs, but basic song structures are more the thing.  However, there was that time at Fillmore East...<br />The songs on this CD, only seven, were originally in an album released as a double LP. Two of the tracks were long enough to each take up an entire LP side.  Gregg Allman on keyboards, Dickie Betts on guitar, Berry Oakley on bass, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe Jai Johanny on percussion, do they ever jam and solo.  And a man named Duane Allman, on guitar.   I sometimes wonder if you sat down 1,000 people who had never heard this CD, played it for them, and asked them afterward whether they think Duane was a mere mortal, would any vote yes?  Actually, my case is more rudimentary.  I need only listen to \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed.\\"  I hold my breath when Gregg's shimmering organ following \\"Hot 'Lanta\\" introduces this incredible performance by Duane and the rest.  When I mention my favorite Allman Brothers \\"song,\\" I speak in terms of studio, saying \\"Jessica\\"--it is a wonderful instrumental, with good soloing, but within a basic structure. But this live version of \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed\\" is a step beyond, into free-flowing improvisation that confounds one's sense of the limitations of what can be achieved in music.  Can anything be described as less limited in comparison to this display of sheer instrumental genius?<br />This brilliant live album has had its praises sung for it over and over, but great albums can still be uneven, at least to a certain extent.  In \\"Live at Fillmore East,\\" there is only excellent and better, from the opening slides of Duane's guitar on \\"Statesboro Blues\\" to the tired breaths uttering \\"I'm dying\\" at the end of \\"Whipping Post.\\"  The latter and the other extended number, \\"You Don't Love Me,\\" contain terrific long jams that slow down in tempo in their later parts and shift some gears, with even a little hamming.  I enjoy a couple of really cool chugging guitar sections in the latter part of \\"You Don't Love Me.\\"  However, \\"Whipping Post\\" is superior--it is more absolutely breathtaking guitar work, by Duane and Dickie Betts.  \\"Hot 'Lanta\\" has a great steady-driving motif providing a good base for fiery soling, and is also brilliant.  \\"Storm Monday\\" is a slower, atmospheric number.  Beginning with Gregg's glowing organ, this song radiates a gorgeous texture featuring organ glides and Betts' sweet guitar licks.<br />Duane had more successes before his unfortunate early death, including his masterful work on Layla in partnership with Eric Clapton.  But this will always be his finest moment, as well as that of this legendary Southern Rock group.  Did I say Southern Rock, which I generally do not care for?  It is always emphasized that to a certain extent, the music here can be described as jazz and blues.  Right, but I acknowledge its Southern Rock origins and feel as well.  But who cares what you call it, just listen and enjoy the best display of musicianship ever to grace the world of rock music.

B0000071J0|4.0|After being disapointed with Le Orme's Contrappunti CD, I didn't think I would buy anymore stuff by these guys. However, after reading numerous reviews of how wonderful this was, I decided I would give it a shot. The arrangements are pretty good, and it being an album length concept piece also helps to move it along, but once again (as on most of Contrappunti)there are moments where they just seem stuck in a mid-tempo repetitive sequence. This is particular true for the middle section that is dominated by vocals. That being said, I also want to say that the vocalist has a really pleasant voice. He has one of the best voices in the italian prog scene, but, at times, it feels like the music stalls for the vocals. I might have given this a 5 star rating, but it is only 33 minutes long, and about 2 minutes of that is a percussion solo. Overall, not a bad disk, and it certainly has a charm to it, but... not enough time changes and virtuosity for a 5 star rating.
B00005JKCF|3.0|The first thirty minutes had me smiling, but after the initial setup the movie falls apart and feels very episodic. Why?  Because the villain had no plan to carry off, so the hero had no goal to reach. The climax was [disappointing] as well -- not enough at stake. The production design was cool, but the lighting overall was flat -- it looked like a TV movie (and what was up with all that _graininess_ during some of the CGI-heavy sequences? Were they re-rendering frames up until the last minute?) I have other gripes as well, but the overall crime here is that what should have been a great movie turned out to be simply mediocre. The Spiderman I know and love still lives in the 1967 animated TV series. <br />Kirsten Dunst has grown up to be a real hottie though.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I, like probably a lot of people, went into this wondering if this movie truly would live up to it's hype. I was hoping it would, but wasn't sure. Then it didn't. It went way beyond the hype it was given. While I liked the special effects and action, what really captivated me was the story and the performance by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker rather than as Spider-Man. As Spider-Man, he was definitley good, but as Parker he had a wider range of emotions to work with, and he had definite chemistry with Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane Watson. Her performance was excellent as well. In fact, everyone's performance was either good or perfect. Good see right away, you will not regret it.
B000002UAX|2.0|This is possibly their most overrated album (which is saying a lot).  Of the 93 minutes running time,  about 3 minutes is worth hearing, and even those 3 minutes are scattered among the songs.  If &quot;dear prudence&quot; is one of John Lennon's &quot;best ballads&quot;, according to the clowns at allmusic.com, then Mr Lennon is probably the most overrrated musician of the century.
B00005JKCF|5.0|For starters \\"Spider-Man\\" is probably the most faithful translation of a comic book superhero to the big screen.  Throughout the movie I kept thinking, yes, this is in \\"Amazing Fantasy\\" #15, that is from the cover of \\"Spider-Man\\" #39, and that is what \\"really\\" happened to the Green Goblin.  Go back and look at \\"Batman,\\" \\"Superman\\" or any other comic book film and you will find that beyond the basic plot of their origin, you will not find anything reminding you of specific issues or great moments from the actual comic books.  On this score I believe the credit goes to director Sam Raimi, but there is always the possibility David Koepp's screenplay might have had something to do with it (note: Stan Lee and Steve Ditko get credit for creating Spider-Man but John Romita, Sr. deserves some credit too given that much of his artwork is invoked by the film as well).<br />Of course there are differences, because film is a different medium from comic books (feel free to quote me on that one).  Some of the changes result from a desire to provide an appropriate rationale for Spidey's powers.  This means we get a scientist providing expositionary details during the visit to the lab where the spider (now genetically enhanced rather than radioactive) puts the bite on Peter Parker.  While this works for the ability to cling to walls and the good old spider-sense, I am less sure about the natural web spinning ability.  I mean, on the one hand, the invention of his special web fluid was how we knew Peter was a brilliant young scientist, while on the other, how does the web go through the costume?  No, this is not \\"No Prize\\" worthy, but it does bug me.<br />My thoughts on other changes: Yes, it was good to forget about Gwen Stacy, go right to Mary Jane Watson and completely ignore Betty Bryant, given the history of Peter Parker's love life.  However, having MJ have a crush on Spidey smacks too much of Superman and Lois Lane for my taste, although since she is a high school senior they were right to tone down her sexuality from the bombshell Peter finally encountered in the comic.  The Spider-Man costume looks a lot better than I thought it would and I certainly understand why the Green Goblin goes heavy metal.  However, the yellow eyes on/off was a bit bothersome, although, again, I understand why you do not want two characters with giant eye blanks trying to have a lengthy conversation.<br />My biggest complaint with the film would be that the computer generated sequences of Spider-Man web-slinging through New York City just do not seem real.  Granted, it is really hard to get a feel for watching somebody do that (compare it to Tarzan going through the trees in the old Johnny Weismueller films versus the Disney cartoon), but maybe they can do something in the future films.  Similarly, some of the fight sequences when Spider-Man takes on a gang seem (ironically) rather cartoonish and, again, I wonder if it is because this is computer generated action.<br />The casting is fine, although Rosemary Harris never looks as frail as we all remember Aunt May.  Tobey Maguire tends to keep things a bit too sedate with MJ after his transformation, but there is undeniable chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst at key moments in the film.  Willem Dafoe does some of his best acting opposite himself (you will see), and James Franco does a nice job of reinventing Harry Osborn for the modern world.  Special kudos to J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who only has a limited number of scenes because he steals every single one of them.  Look real quick to spot Stan Lee in this film.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" is one of those films you give 4.5 stars, because it manages to surpass expectations in some key regards while still needing to be improved in some other areas.  However, the basics are all here for extending the franchise and I have to think that the second time around they will fix all of these \\"problems.\\"  Ultimately, the faults are not of the comic book story but ofthe filmmaking, and who would have ever thought that would be the case?  The main thing is that even hardcore Spider-Man fans are not going to be bitterly disappointed by this film.but of the filmmaking, and who would have ever thought that would be the case?

B000002LMK|5.0|A great answer to corporate rock.  Straight ahead no bs stuff.  Crazy Horse sounds at times like they are barely competent (check out the drumming).  But that is the genius of this CD.  Who says music is about being a virtuoso?  It is about passion first and foremost.   <br />I saw Neil and Crazy Horse on tour to support this CD.  Social Disortion and Sonic Youth opened.  After hearing Ragged Glory on CD and seeing the opening acts listed (I had already been a Sonic Youth fan), I knew this was going to be a LOWD evening.  My co-workers were expecting \\"Heart of Gold\\".  What they got from the 15th row was Bob Dylan's \\"Blowing In the Wind\\" electrified to about 110 decibels and a giant peace sign as a backdrop (a not so subtle hint of protest about the Gulf War).  Then almost the entire Ragged Glory CD (see the double live CD Weld for this tour's recordings). No acoustic guitars, no harmonica, just blistering rock n' roll send from the heart that still sends chills up my spine when I think about it.

B00005NNT1|1.0|I am sorry, but I was never impressed with Snow White. I'm sorry if that sounds offensive, because obviously this is a movie that has been a classic for many years, but...I have known this film for many years, and I have never been able to understand how it can be regarded as children's movie material. I am much older now, but it still creeps me out. <br />Disney has made many, many praiseworthy and wonderful movies: Aladdin, Lion King, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty....those are the kinds of movies that I would happily show my children. Snow White completely and totally misses its target audience...yes, it's a classic, but they may as well have made it a live-action movie because it's not much of a child's film.....alright, so maybe that's a little exaggeration. There are some very sweet and memorable scenes in this movie with Snow White and the beloved and sweet dwarfs....but they could have gone a little easy with the villain and the evil side of the story. This is a Disney movie that brings out the dark issues of irrational jealousy, murder, and things along that line. I am sorry if this sounds offensive...this is just the way I always viewed the movie, and I would not want my own children to watch it.

044651652X|4.0|After completing the epilogue to Bridges, A Thousand Country Roads, I reread Bridges and found the same emotional impact I felt the first time around. Wow! I have missed that. I also took a previous reviewer's challenge and read these novels next to Shade of the Maple, whose cover says it is 'the most intimate novel since The Bridges of Madison County.' I beg to differ. It is more intimate and better than Bridges. Heresy to some, I know, but find out for yourself. Intense descriptions, page-turning drama, a deep understanding of the human heart and an ending that you will never forget. Plus the author is donating $1.00 from every sale to breast cancer research. If half the people who pick up Bridges or its epilogue also pick up Martin's book, we'd raise a lot of money, and I can guarantee a lot of people will have found a new favorite author. In summary, if you liked Bridges, you owe it to yourself to read both Shade of the Maple and A Thousand Country Roads.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Very rarely has a movie given me such a feeling of anticipation as Spider-Man, and I don't even read the comics. This said, it follows that this review should be fairly unbiased and good for the majority of people who don't spend days studying the brightly colored panels and speech balloons. (No offense to one of my good friends who does, or anyone else of that nature.) And that said, this follows: the movie was most thoroughly excellent. That's all there is. I'm not going to run down the plot; by now, you should know it, and if you don't, go see it and find out. Acting? Good. Quite good. Toby Maguire, except for a couple bad lines, falls into the character perfectly, and all the other actors hold up well. The exception is Willem Dafoe, who goes above and beyond the rest. He gets the play the insane bad guy, the Green Goblin, and he does the role with flamboyance, humor, and a perfect touch of drama. Storyline? Excellent. As said, I don't read the comics, so I can't make a comparison. What I can say is Spider-Man's story is focused totally on the characters rather then a wild destroy-the-world plot, and it makes for a much stronger movie. The greatest asset is the interplay between them: Peter Parker and his best friend are in love with the same girl, the best friend's father sees Peter as more of a son then his own son, Peter and the father are friends on the surface and their alter-egos are enemies; it's intricate but stops at the perfect point before \\"bad soap opera\\". More so, the ending was very strong; it's not quite what you expect, and it manages to add both a good sense of closure and an opening for a sequel. The action? Ignore that elitist fool Ebert's review. He complains the action scenes lack presence and look fake. I reply they are frequent, fast-paced, exciting, and absolutely perfect for a movie like this. Few things beat webslinging around the streets of NY for coolness. It is here, however, that my one tiny complaint arises. In the moments where Spider-Man goes mano a mano with Green Goblin, there is only one time when the blows are going back and forth; the rest is of one beating the other up. Now this still looks very cool, but the fighting between them could have been done a little better. The action scenes also feel a little short. Fortunately this is made up by them being fairly frequent and looking incredibly cool. The camera work is used to maximum effectiveness, racing after the masked man has he zips around the streets, slowing down during explosions, and generally adding to the limitless energy contained in the movie. Special effects look just right. Spider-Man is great beating up four bad guys at once; he can jump and flip circles around them, and unlike say, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I would love for Ebert to read this) it look real, as though he is strong enough to leap that high, and it does not look like he has two or three wires linked to a hidden belt. Watching him swing through the streets takes the feeling \\"How cool would that be\\" to new levels. The movie also adds a touch of humor at just the right points, and a touch of drama at just the right others. And watching Peter evolve from a social outcast to a kid with a new toy to a new type of social outcast, one with responsibilities he cannot share, adds a very human depth to the film. Spider-Man is a great movie, mixing action and drama in just the right levels. Now if they can just do a sequel, and soon.
0736041850|5.0|Got this book a few weeks ago and often refer back to it.  I've been looking for a while for some kind of pictorial reference showing which muscles get worked more and/or less by various exercises, and now I've found one.  The drawings and illustrations are very good and appear to be pretty accurate, based on MRI images that I've compared them to.  I find the muscle cutaway illustrations particularly useful - they show what's being worked underneath the superficial muscles.  It's sprinkled with lots of other interesting items as well, such as an explanation and illustration of the difference between pennate and fusiform muscles - something I haven't seen yet in any of the other books or online sources that I have read.  This book gets a central place on my shelf (when it's not in my workout bag).  Friends at the gym like it too.  There may be better books of this type out there, but this is the best one that I've seen so far.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|The best Rock &amp; Roll concert on CD,... EVER!<br />Schenker,... wow.
0070511136|5.0|As a professional salesperson, sales manager, and CEO with over 25 years of experience and previously one of the top 5% of salespeople in a Fortune 500 corporation, I have attended practically every sales seminar offered and read every book that I could get my hands on. This book is a classic. It is the best book written for salespeople that have to sell a concept that is more complex than an impulse item. I use it for training all our new sales people and highly recommend it.
B000059H98|5.0|This is just a fun comic book-like movie. Sure the acting and story is on the goofball side but that's what you want to see when you watch a movie like this. Some times it's just fun to be silly.
B00005JKYS|3.0|We Were Soldiers, unlike a lot of movies about Vietnam or even other wars, succeeds at bringing you the story of the soldiers without being mired in the preachiness of the ills of war. My one complaint about Black Hawk Down is that you never really get to know the soldiers so when calamity strikes you don't really get it. We Were Soldiers makes them real, and the inclusion of the experiences of those on the homefront is a great move. It's one thing when a soldier dies on the battlefield, a whole other when his wife receives word at home. I also give kudos to We Were Soldiers for realizing that the enemy on the other side (in this case the Viet Cong) weren't just a faceless monolith of asian menace but instead had families and lives back home they felt they were fighting for. The inclusion of this makes other Vietnam-era movies seem a lot less well rounded in comparison.
B00004Z459|3.0|Out of all the new metal bands that realeased cds in the past couple of months, Hybrid Theory is probably the most well known. This band has had alot of different kinds of comments too, some love it, some hate it, I however, appear to be right in between. There is nothing truly \\"wrong\\" with this band, but they did make some wrong discions. The band had some great potential, but the execution was sloppy.<br />Most people have given this cd bad reviews for things like the fact that Chestor Bennington looks like a member of N'Sync and sounds just like one. I will say that is NOT why this is a bad band. He can't help what he looks like, and anyways, who cares? You listen to music, you don't watch it. And for the fact that he sounds like a boy band singer, that isn't a bad thing. That is good. This guy is one of the few metal singers out there who sang because it was what he was good at, not because he wanted the most attention.<br />This band also has some good guitar riffs, Brad Delson also knows what he is doing. The band doesn't just crank up the amp and strum of the strings and call it music. Although it is pretty loud throughout, the riffs do show some talent behind them, not to say that they are extremely tough to play either.<br />So far, I have not mentioned why this is a bad cd. These two things are pluses. The Delson and Bennington are a great match. Bennington has got a great voice for screaming, yet he does not stray from actually singing. Same with the Delson. He does blare out some loud sound, yet you can still make out the cords he plays. Together, they make a very melodic, and good metal band.<br />Yet I am not finished, there is one more vocalist in this band, you know who he is, the MC, Mike Shinoda. The majority of this album, Mike is rapping, and this is one thing that keeps this album from being great. His ryhmes just don't seem to fit the music. You've got a great riff, and good chorus, and suddenly it gets quiet and Shinoda comes in, and everything great dies, until the chorus, where Bennington does the majority of his work. When Bennington sings, he is spectacular, his voice carries right along with the guitar, making everything very melodic, which then ends when Shinoda barges in and ryhmes away. Mike alone is not a bad guy, his work in In the End was good, one occasion when he does fit, but in songs like Papercut, With You and By Myself, he just does not belong.<br />There is also one more thing that is wrong, Mr. Hahn. I think that DJs are not good in metal bands. To me true metal is a singer, guitar player, bass player, and drums, these are the core instruments of true rock, scratching came in somewhere, and it ruined a few bands along to way, this is the case with Linkin Park. His appearances in songs come at bad times and, like Shinoda, ruin some of the songs.<br />Now some of you fans of Linkin Park may think I am crazy. But you need to understand that this is just not the kind of music I like. I like metal, true, original, plain metal, without added stuff, like a rapper or a DJ. I rated three stars by MY standards on music, not yours. I know that there are other people out ther who have my standards too, and I wrote this for them, I would advise you to skip this one. But anyone who is looking for something new, not totally new, but different that most rock, this may be what you are looking for.
044022425X|4.0|The fourth book in the Outlander series begins in 1769, as our favorite middle-aged couple, Scottish Highlander Jamie Fraser and his time-traveling bride Claire, begin a new life in the mountain wilderness of North Carolina.  Having traveled across the Atlantic, with a brief stop in the Caribbean, the two are ready to settle down and make a home of their own.  Meanwhile two hundred years back in the future, their daughter, Brianna, continues to frustrate her historian boyfriend, Roger, by refusing his marriage proposal.  Both Roger and Brianna are troubled by a newspaper clipping that spells disaster for her parents, and each secretly chooses to handle the news in their own way.<br />This installment of the Outlander saga takes some of the focus off of Jamie and Claire, and focuses more on Brianna and Roger, who aren't all that interesting at first glance.  We also meet some old friends and new enemies.  Unfortunately, it took almost 400 pages before I really got into this book, unlike the earlier three.  Of course, the good news is that I still had over 600 pages of excellent reading that I couldn't put down!  The last few pages were the best.  Now I am ready to dive into the fifth Outlander book, The Fiery Cross.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones has talent, but. . .On Come Away With Me, the sidemen don't add much. She needs to work with a better group, &amp; that should include a pianoman. There is too much in this album that is (literally and emotionally) in the same key. She needs, in short, a jazz group, with a Tommy Flanagan feeling and a good beat.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This one fascinated me. The whole story developes an unexpected way and is deeply thrilling giving new brainfood any time it turns. The professional visuals fit in very nicely, not destroying the atmosphere by launching killer-effects or high-end-pyrotechnics any second.<BR>Some people said they found the movie wasn't &quot;dark&quot; enough. I thought it was very dark - and cold. And all was done very subtle. The acting didn't convince me completely, but it is all solid work well done.<BR>Not my favorite Spielberg but among the best.
B0000640VO|5.0|'Amelie' is a French film that tells of Amelie's (Tatou) desire to help others whilst at the same time realising that she needs helping herself.  Usually this kind of movie would be cloying and sentimental but Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to keep it both light, touching and at times marvellously funny.<br />Tatou is an absolute revalation as the central character, managing to remain at once cute and feisty.  Also important is the manner in which Amelie helps people, not just with small favours but with careful thought and intent that has a beautifully touching effect.  Added to this is a wonderful score and sumptuous photography that completely immerses its audience into the streets and gardens of Paris.<br />What's great about it though is that its never too sentimental and at times is genuinely humorous.  For instance, the list of what each character likes and dislikes is fantastically well observed.  To conclude, it's been a long time since there's been a movie of this kind that is both heart-felt and touching.  This is a movie with bounce in its step - a modern classic!
B00005JKYS|5.0|The reality of the movie is unquestioned!  It depicts the horrors of war and proves to all that real warriors seek alternatives to the shedding of blood.  Real warriors know that once the fight starts, there is no quarter, given or expected.<br />The best picture in many long decades.  Best film 2002!
B0000636UN|1.0|If Amazon let customers return a CD merely because it stinks, I'd send this back in a New York minute.  I absolutely LOVE Sheryl's other stuff, but this is like eating bubble gum for dinner compared with her earlier works.  Gone are the dark songs with nothing but Sheryl's plaintive and contemplative voice. Gone is her wonderfully flippant creativity.  They're replaced with overdone, overproduced made-for-radio pop. You'll love the songs the first time you hear them, and be sick of them by the third.  How disappointing!
B00003CXA2|5.0|One of the first movies I ever saw in theaters, \\"Forrest Gump\\" has to be one of my favorite movies ever.<BR>Winner of 6 Oscars including Best Picture, Actor (Tom Hanks), and Director (Robert Zemeckis), \\"Forrest Gump\\" tells the story of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted young man growing up during the 50's and 60's.  His life spans over many fruitful events: he teaches Elvis to dance as a child, wins the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, competes in a world-championship game of ping pong, opens a successful shrimp business in memory of a friend who died in Vietnam, and invests blindly in Apple Computers, making a fortune.  He also meets three Presidents, witnesses Watergate, and runs across the country.  And all this is happening while dealing with the love-of-his-life Jenny (Robin Wright), and his cancerous mother (Sally Field).  Gary Sinise also gives an excellent performance as Lt. Dan, Forrest's commander in Vietnam, who turns out to be a life-long friend.<br />\\"Forrest Gump\\" is definitely one of the best movies ever made.  Full of great acting, sharp directing, and a killer screenplay, see this movie before someone else does!
B000059T5O|5.0|The debate over whether this is a proper interpretation of Tom Waits' songs or a Waits-inspired blues album reminds me of the lite beer commercials - Is it great tasting, or less-filling?  Forget about who wrote the songs and produced the album, this is a great collection of songs that kicks butt!  It's one of those CD's that make you want to roll down the windows of your car and share the funky grooves with everybody else on the street.  Blues fans will love the swampy guitar licks and the ground-shaking rhythm section, but that combined with Waits' image-evoking lyrics create a synergy to make \\"Wicked Grin\\" greater than the sum of its parts.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is possibly the best CD i have heard in the last 5 years. It is absolutely superb. The variation of the band is superb and i really cant think of enough superlatives to describe the voice of brandon boyd. Buy it..NOW!!!
B00005JKCF|4.0|i have always been a Spider man fan ever since i was a kid. i used to be fascinated by his *great* moves and *funny* one-liners.<br />Sam Raimi did a terrific+amazing+wonderful job at directing this film. The computer enhanced version of NY city was just out of this world. <BR>the storyline is based on the comic, of course. Peter Parker, a science whiz and a  {nerd}. one day, while visiting a university lab, he gets bitten by genetically enhanced super spider and gets 17 spiders assets.<BR>and there's Mary Jane, the love of his life. and then there's Norman Osbourne aka Green Goblin......<br />no matter what, this movie is amazing, but i thought it was missing certain stuff and felt like it was not completed. lot of people thought that Tobey Mcguire was GOOD but not GREAT, some mentioned that he shouldve got bigger and buffer. i personally thought Kirsten Dunst was great. she is such a talented actress, who is very versatile. i believe she has a potential to beocme one of the greatest actress of all time.<BR>Dafoe, is a very amazing actor as well, his facial expressions were simply out of this world, i thought he did not even have to speak his lines...<br />once again, very well made, i suggest everyone go see it and rate it for themselves.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Rush's &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot; sounds like no other album either by Rush or anyone else for that matter. Finally casting off the 'Led Zepellin jnr' mantle they propelled themselves towards rock superstardom. The album kicks off with A Farewell To Kings-gently soothing the listener with an acoustic opening before the tumult of bass,drums and electric guitar comes crashing in,introducing the piercing cry of Geddy Lee's vocals,wrought with anger yet plaintiff and hopeful.What can be said of Xanadu? Surely there isnt a rock fan out there that hasnt experienced this theatrical rock extravaganza!A masterpiece of portentious guitar and keyboards-worth the price of the CD by itself.Closer To the Heart is another Rush standard, more acoustic guitar and a Top 30 hit single in the UK.An all-time classic.<BR>Straight ahead rock follows with Cinderella Man, then the beautiful Madrigal lulls you into a false sense of security before the monster that is Cygnus X-1.This is Rush's trademark: Sci-Fi meets Metal and the listener is the winner. Black holes and space travel what a way to end an album, and the promise of 'to be continued.'Anyone who doesnt own this album should order it now!
B00005OAIE|5.0|After seeing a T.V. special on John Mayer and hearing &quot;No Such Thing&quot; so many times I was sick of it I bought the CD and I have to say that I'm glad that I did. It's almost addictive, because of the lyrics that draw you in and the guitar riffs that keep you captivated. I do have to say he is fond of the same few notes but it's hard to mark him down for that he's still young and learning. As for comparing him to other artist's, it's impossible. He is putting his youth, the youth that I know and that we're all trying to keep and putting it down on paper and I don't know of anyone else that has really done that that I've found. This is the one of the best albums of the year and John will go far.
B00005JKCF|1.0|I see that most people loved this movie, I have a feeling thats because everything thats come to the movie theatres in recent times has just [disappointed].  Personally though I thought the acting, direction, and even the action was just boring and predictable.  Give me Indiana Jones or the first Batman movie any day over this horrible excuse for a movie.  Spiderman deserved so much more, but I guess Marvel was so broke they just couldn't deny the studio from releasing the film, sad... Final Thoughts: Bad, Awful and [horrible]
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just saw it today! It was incredible. The special effects where of the highest callibar I've ever seen. The only thing that might rival it's CGI are that of \\"The Matrix\\" but that's it. I'm 14 years old and I've been a long time fan of Spider-Man so as you can imajine I was extremely pickey. But I found absolutely nothing to pick at. It was perfect. I particularly enjoyed the little things like the costume and the music. Spider-Man apeals to kids and adults alike because he's just an average kid who's sent into extraordinary circumstances. He's not an alien or someone popular and rich. He's a real guy with real problems. I recomend this film to everyone who likes spider-man. I recomend it to every one who doesn't know what a Spider-Man is. I evan recomend it to those of you who hate Spider-Man becaue if you still do after seeing this movie than your just not right in the head.
B000002AGN|5.0|I remember hearing parts of this album when I was about 10 years old, and even then I was blown away by it! Many years later, I listened to the full album for the first time and amazingly, it still sounds fresh! With Dave on piano and Paul Desmond on alto sax, these two created a masterpiece without really trying to. Personally, I feel it stands alongside albums like Kind Of Blue, 'Round About Midnight and several others as one of the best jazz albums of all time. Not to be missed!

6305558167|5.0|This is one of the great films of the last 20 years, and my favourite.   For some reason it is not as well known as it should be. For me it should be in the top ten films of all time.<BR> For Americans I would like to say that all the accents in the film are English, maybe apart from Liam Neeson. <BR>    We do not all speak like Hugh Grant. The range of accents in England are far more deverse than anything you would find in America. Maybe this is not the most important issue but I thought I would set the record straight.
B00003CXA6|5.0|As a Brit, it may seam unusual to have an interest in Civil War history, but having read Killer Angels, I just had to get the DVD. Fortunately I have a multi region player, and was not dissapointed. The film sticks faithfully to the book's focus on charactres rather than the bloodshed &amp; violence, and thus is extremely moving. Richard Jordan's pain during his final meeting with Longstreet is almost unbearable, and worth the purchase price for that alone. I would recommend this film to anybody, and would tell them not to be put off by the length...you do not notice it as you are utterly engrosed. One of THE best films.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Arie's &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is incredibly beautiful music.  This is what you would call &quot;grown folks' music&quot;!  While I love every track on this CD (including the thought-provoking &quot;Video&quot; and the scintillating &quot;Brown Skin&quot; {not to mention it is one more reminder of why one should be proud of being black!}), I would like to bring noteworthy attention to the incredible gem &quot;Simple&quot; and the awesome and inspiring &quot;Wonderful,&quot; which is a tribute to Arie's hero Stevie Wonder.  &quot;Simple&quot; is a spare and beautiful love song that musically and lyrically (in its &quot;simple&quot; arrangement) puts much of what passes on the radio as love songs to shame. Stevie Wonder must be flattered by &quot;Wonderful,&quot; a beautiful song about why our elders are so important to our growth as people and artists.  Listening to this has made me want to write something (albeit non-musical) for my own hero, the great novelist Toni Morrison. <br />India.Arie's &quot;strength, courage and wisdom&quot; is evident on every facet of this CD.  It is the reason why music should be made and played!  You will be hard pressed to find much in the record store this positive, this soulful and this dynamic.  India.Arie may not have won any Grammys, but that is a poor reflection on the people who decide who is deserving of the gold plated phonographs.  Those of us who own &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; already know what the rest of the world should.  When this CD dropped in stores, India.Arie was already a winner!<br />India.Arie, you have a fan for life. I love what you do.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Whoever said that 24-year olds and older shouldn't watch cartoons obviously hasn't seen Shrek. The comedic quad of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphey, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow gives this high-tech modern fairy tale its charm. With plenty of &quot;in&quot; jokes and an &quot;alternative&quot;-sounding soundtrack that is a welcome relief from schmaltzy Disney music, Shrek is a movie that young kids will want to watch over and over, and the parents won't mind. They'll be laughing right along with it. Not only is this a well-made, funny, and endearing movie, the surprising ending is very affirming, especially for kids who might feel &quot;different&quot; from other children. I especially recommend this movie for ANY parents who have children with esteem issues, or who might just need a boost of self-confidence. One warning, though: the movie DOES contain a smattering of swear words; but given the current state of television and most movies, the words are easily explained by parents who sit down and watch the movie with their children. If I could have given this movie ten stars, I would have.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Isn't it possible that all the &quot;mysterious&quot; and unexplainable plot twists in Mulholland Drive really are just a result of having to slap together a feature film ending on a tv series pilot?  Lynch sets in motion many intriguing sub-plots and characters in the first half of the film, which is very watchable, in my opinion.  But then the film unravels, and in effect forgets itself, which is very unsatisfying.  The care with which these characters, even the minor ones, are introduced, makes the finale seem unfair.  I wanted more...as in a whole season of episodic television, which is obviously what Lynch had in mind.  I've read a lot of intricate analyses of this film, and I keep thinking it is all one huge case of &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot;, with David Lynch having a laugh at all the film &quot;experts&quot; who see brilliant symbolism and metaphor instead of a naked failed tv pilot.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I have known that Robbie has a superb voice, and that he is a remarkable performer. But hearing his performance of Swing When You're Winning and watching the Live at the Albert DVD has blown me away. He is a musical genius, and I hope we will see/hear more from him.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Will Rocks as Ali! His sass-mouthed remarks on George Foreman and other opponents bring chuckles and wrinkles about my lips. He cracks me up. The show I'd recommend to friends. I admire this tough boxer. I saw some parts. This movie Rocks!!!
B00005JKMQ|2.0|Thought it was going to be an epic, turned out to be just plain pathetic. This movie lacked so much. Who cares that will smith bulk up for the role and looked a little like ali.  I wanted to know more about his life.  They could have shown less about the fights and more about the man...... poorly done, big budget flop, thats why it fell of the radar at the movie theaters.
B00005JKCF|5.0|An unwilling young boy gets bitten my a mutated spider and becomes the super hero: Spiderman!!!<br />Tobey Macguire stars as your freindly neighborhood Spiderman in this fast paced spazmatic action movie. Kirsten Dunst stars as the beatiful love intrest of Peter Parker, the red haired Mary Jane Watson. Watching Spiderman was very entertaining eventhough I knew what the story was. Watching it was like watching a tennis match, moving your eyes back and forth, back and forth. <br />As far is I can see, Willem Dafoe played the Green Goblin almost flawlessly. Because of a science experiment gone wrong, the mild manered scientist Norman Osborne gets metamorphisised into the supervillian Green Goblin. <br />James Franco plays the cast aside son of Norman Osborne, Harry Osborne. Although he doesn't have a big roll in the movie, you will see him in the other movies. <br />The movie has an unpretentous B-movie quality that made it irresistable to any movie goer. Unlike the other comic book to movie ventures, Spiderman stayed very very very true to the comic series. The webslinging scenes and the fight scenes truly made the movie come to life.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is an all time great. Marlon Brando shoews us what true acting is by inventing lines that never existed, or atleasst he acted themas though they never existed. Al Pacino fits into the role very nicely. He is sweet and kind and loving. But when he takes over from his father's positoin, he becomes mercilesslly ruthless. James Caan , the big brother , too fitted into his role nicely, his bossy attitude adn luck with the women. Fredo was'nt much of a character in this movie, he acted in very few scenes. Tom Hagen, Robert Duvall has always been a class actor. He gave a good performance, but I'd have to say that I've seen a few better.<BR>All in all though, this film is one of the best I've ever seen. It has everything.<BR>IT's a class film.
B00000I1OY|5.0|I'm a real movie buff, but can't believe I missed this one... The story of a mid life hansome man Burt Lancaster, swimming home across the county,via his neighbors back yard swimming pools. It doesn't take too long to realize his view of his life differs greatly from the friends and neighbors, (some not so friendly,) that he encounters as he swims home.  I was left wanting to read the book, as I felt this was a story that was too complicated to cover in a 2 hour movie. Its a movie that some how gets under your skin and leaves you wanting more. He keeps talking about his daughters at home playing tennis,and how much they adore him, he tells everyone his wife is fine..and everything is wonderful in his life....at the end he arrives home to an abandoned, rundown estate..he has obviously been living in the past..but I kept wondering where he had been in the years between actually living there and swimming back home. The people he encounters along the way paint a story and hint of his financial, legal and marrital disasters, but he denies all of it the throughout the movie. I wonder how a re-make of today would handle this movie.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller has produced a masterpiece with this novel. A masterpiece of the absurd. The absurd of democracy. The democracy of the US armed forces. Any one has rights, but each right is blocked either because someone higher has the authority to block it, or because the implementation of this right shows that the subject does not qualify for this right. In such a situation there is only one solution : escapism. The situation is dramatic since we are in Italy during the second world war. Simple pilots and bombardiers have no say whatsoever on their fate or lot. Either it goes against the authority of someone higher up who makes them do what he wants to satisfy his own ambition. Or it goes against the general trafficking by the local entrepreneur in the armed forces who aims at making money on the war situation in the name of free enterprise, asking for the war to be privitized. Or it goes against circular rules that disqualify you as a beneficiary of these rules as soon as you ask for them to apply to you. Those questions are very serious. Where is the dignity of the warriors ? Where are the noble objectives of the war ? Where is the defense of the country in such a war ? Where are courage, loyalty, heroism when everything is mercantilized and speculated upon for the profit of a few ? And what does victory mean in such a situation where some are trafficking with the enemy in order to make money, even on the military operations themselves ? The world is absurd and one can only escape from it if one wants to retain one's sanity. But, as opposed to Kafka, this author uses humor and makes us laugh at such silly situations : it is a highly funny book, but in which any laugh or smile hides the sadness of the situations or facts with great difficulty. We would really like to get angry at such mediocre middlemen who dictate hell for other people in their own interest and can do that because these other people lack the courage to rebel, are like sheep following the flock without protesting.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUhout protesting.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

B00005JKL8|3.0|This  movie was great for about the  first 30  or 45 minutes  of the movie. Afer that, the  rest was incredibly predictable! It was similiar to the 1970's film \\"BAt 21\\" in most aspects, but other  than that, you could tell  what was going to happen. I agree that it was an excellent movie with great sounds and effects, but the plot was unbelievibly corny!!! I only bought it on DVD to  watch the missile chase scene and thats it! I also belive  that, just like the critics, another person should have been picked for the lead character. Even though Owen Wilson acts tough at times, his facial expressions are as bad as the writing  in this movie. All in all, \\"Behind  Enemy Lines\\"  is a great movie with endless possibilities, but no plot. If you want to see a great war-action movie, go see \\"Black Hawk Down\\".
B0000022WA|5.0|All ages can enjoy this family film about two girls (played by Hayley Mills) who meet at summer camp and discover they're twins. They decide to switch places so they can both meet their long-lost parent (Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith) and they they try to reunite their parents. Hilarity ensues, of course.<br /><br /> Hayley Mills is natural and charismatic in the dual role and the trick photography is great.  O'Hara and Keith are both appealing as the  parents.  They make this Disney movie a classic you'll want to see again and again.
B000021Y7W|5.0|Movie musicals had fallen out of favor by the 1980s, but there were still two that belong on the list of the decade's 10 best: Franco Zefferelli's breathtakingly colorful revision of<br />Verdi's La Traviata, starring Teresa Status and Placido Domingo.  The other is Jonathan Demme's hip, fast-paced and creative documentary, Stop Making Sense.<br />Shot over several days during live concerts at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, the movie brilliantly captures the creativity of David Byrne and the members of his 1980s band, the Talking Heads.<br />Stop Making Sense grows from a bare stage, with Byrne alone, except for an acoustic guitar and a boom box, performing \\"Psycho Killer,\\" to a full-fledged concert, with the entire band, including Tina Weymouth's other band, the Tom Tom Club.  Things really get rockin' when Byrne and Tom Tom Club roar into \\"Burnin' Down the House,\\" during \\"Take Me to the River, \\" and especially when Byrne, a consummate showman, dons his \\"big suit,\\" which he wears for much of the film's second half.<br />Stop Making Sense is a masterpiece of film editing, too. There is none of the backstage babble one would expect from a concert film, and it's tightly put together.<br />Only Woodstock captures the raw essence of the rock concert better than this does.  Stop Making Sense is one of the great film of the 1980s.
B00005NWM3|3.0|This is a pretty generic hard rock album.  There's no exceptional guitar riffs,  catchy double bass drumming, or  Geddy Lee like bass lines.  However, the songs have that stick-in-your-head quality.  You'll want to play this album over and over, though you'll quickly get sick of it.  I'd recommend this album, though if you don't have it, you're not missing much.

B00005T30L|5.0|I had to watch Ghost World twice to really see its genius in showing the very absurdity and hypocrisy of American society.  One of my favorite bits is the art teacher, who challenges her students to get controversial...but of course, when Enid really DOES no one can truly handle it.  The first half is some of the best condensened filmmaking I've ever seen-the second half is a bit less astounding...but what can you expect?
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is such an incredibly beautiful and thought invoking movie.<br />A lot of the themes and topics of discussion in the movie (which is more in form like the Dialogues that were oh so vogue with philosophers in the old days like Plato and so on) are by no means the sort of things you would overhear in a Mc Donald's or at the Blockbuster; discussions that if you were to bring them up with your friends at the bar it would most definitely sour the mood of those around you: reality, memory, the conflict of science and religion, death, and so on. There is most often too much white noise and distraction in our lives to bring out the things in the open that a lot of us think of within ourselves, and they end up being our pretentious little thoughts that have no true beginnings and endings. The ramblings of a consciousness that drifts towards a final destination, yet fades away in darkness- and so on. And so on. <br />And so on- this movie is often remarked as being pretentious: going to many places at one time; never exactly sure what it's saying, so it says everything it can. Yet this is a film which explores those things in life which we may never have a hope of answering. How can you know death till you are dead? You can be as poetic and eloquent as you want, use your metaphors- you do not know a thing. All you can do is talk, and talk, and talk. And that is exactly what this movie does: talk. <br />What truly disgusts me is that the Academy Awards (a \\"ceremony\\" which is far beyond that line of self-parody and is now bargain-binned into oblivion) overlooked this film in the Animated Feature category. I say overlooked loosely since it is obvious that this film is far beyond the minds of those who take such award shows seriously... No, how can you suggest that the nature of reality is of no importance to the average person?? Do those who hold no interests in art have no anxiety towards dying, as well?  Is there any less angst in some then others? This is a movie for every man, woman and child, about the things which we all wonder within and keep like a secret to ourselves. Have you ever wondered if a body sleeps and never wakes up after it dies? Of course you have. We cannot all be Zen masters, and hypnotize ourselves into not being afraid of what lies beyond the dark. This is a movie that brings those things out- and has been ostracized for it.  This is a movie (very much like Dazed and Confused) about being trapped and, triumphantly, escaping into... who knows? <br />The last frame of the film, where the hero floats into blurring light is the end of this life. An end of bodily functions like intelligence which only add to the pretentiousness of living. It is an end that has a beginning. Raymond Moody, who has spent the better part of his life studying people on their deathbeds, those who were terminally dead for a few minutes, and so on- said something like \\"I don't really know what happens after you die. I don't think there is anything that really gives the experience justice you can say about dieing. After all these years, the closest I ever got to defining it is that its like watching TV for a long time, and then changing the channel- and even that by no means even scratches the surface of the true experience.\\" Poe also said \\"All of this just seems as but a dream within a dream\\"
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best movies i've ever seen i first thought that since most of spider-man was in computer graphics it wouldn't look realistic but you can't tell whats real and whats not.
6301095014|3.0|In FIRST BLOOD, Rambo was fighting for his personal freedom against a ruthless cop. In RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD II, Rambo redeemed himself and his country by returning to Vietnam to rescue imprisoned American POW's. The Vietcong in the film were backed and financed by Communist Russia, foreshadowing events to come in RAMBO III. In this movie, Rambo's mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) is taken prisoner in Afganistan while assisting the Afganian rebels against the invading Soviet forces. Rambo comes \\"out of retirement\\" from working in a Buddahist commune to rescue his old friend and teacher. In the process he becomes friends with the Afganian people and ends up kicking the tar out of the Soviet military.<br />There are a lot of inaccurate depictions in RAMBO III. However, the Rambo films aren't about staying true to truth and reality (well, FIRST BLOOD is an exception). They are about a new modern American superhero; a guy who is invincible, a one-man army who gets to blow lots of things up, kill lots of bad guys, all for the sake of truth, justice, and the American way.<br />I admit the film seems totally different since September 11, 2001. However, that makes the movie a little more interesting to watch. The past, including dated movies, can teach us a great deal.
B000002GJH|4.0|TEMPLE OF THE DOG is a cd that in the last couple of weeks, I have been playing alot lately. The project was put together over 10 years ago by Chris Cornell and future members of Pearl Jam. It was a tribute album to thier fallen friend, Andrew Wood who died from an overdose. A few weeks ago, another great voice from the Great Northwest was silenced forever when Layne Staley from Alice In Chains was found died. His death made me remember the great music on this album that seemed a fitting way to remember Layne. This album has some awesome rocking songs. HUNGER STRIKE is the most known of the tracks. The songs rocks and with Eddie Vedder also singing lead the songs is a classic to be heard from now until infinity. TIMES OF TROUBLE, SAY HELLO 2 HEAVEN, PUSHIN' FORWARD BACK are also songs that the listener will be [pulled] into listening. The classic, epic track here is REACH DOWN. It clocks in at over 11 minutes, but the listener is never bored by it. It should be up on a platform with FREEBIRD OR STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN. Besides having some great rocking music, one other strengh this album has is the great voice of Chris Cornell. He has the greatest voice around to be singing rock today. I recommend this album highly and think that it is a must for serious rock fans.
B00004T9UF|5.0|first of all...i dunno why ppl think THE SLIM SHADY LP is better than this one. true, that was real tight with some tight lyrics. but...waittaminute. this is definite growth, dunt think i coulda beared to hear The Slim Shady LP part 2. this disc is different, and better. it is more personal n angry. songs like marshall mathers, the way i am and b please 2 wouldnt have fit on the previous album. this is realer, and more than cartoonish lyrics. stan is a masterpiece, a wonderul story of a crazed fan and the dido chorus makes the song off the hook....<BR> b please 2 is a banger, snoop and eminem should make more songs. infact, i think there should be a b please 3. and soon too! anyways this is a tight cd, peep out under the influence coz it's real slick. the slim shady lp type stuff with a more thuggish approach. his voice especially, he's changed it a bit. made it more mature, and thuggish.<BR>tight album. no skippable tracks except for 'amityville' prolly.
6305842442|3.0|Let me state that this is the greatest science fiction movie ever made in my opinion. I am old enough to have actually seen the movie in a theatre. It had a large impact on my life. While many people prefer the sparse style of the director's cut, I would really love to see theatrical edition included in any blade runner boxed set for balance. A lot of newcomers to Blade Runner only see the Directors Cut and many of them end up hating the movie. Including Harrison Ford's voiceover answers one burning question: Why the heck did Roy save Decker's life?<br />The Decker/android/unicorn theory is so contrived that it is not worth  adding it into the movie. If you have only seen the Director's cut, please don't judge it too harshly. Wait till  you have seen the theatrical version. Good luck finding a copy though.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Being a Spidey fan, I was a little nervous that this film wouldn't live up to the hype. Nothin' doin'!!!! This film was more than worth the ticket fee and is a sure-fire repeat of \\"amazing\\" proportions!!! The poses and battle moves spidey uses are right on, as well as his dialogue. Mary Jane Watson is hot as ever being played by Kirsten Dunst(Oh God!!!!) and livens things for Spidey in several rather nice ways!! I won't ruin it for people, but I tell you now the fight scenes and scenarios are [great]. The only thing that [upset] me royally was the ending with Mary Jane and Peter Parker! He has the oportunity to \\"capitalize\\" on his ultimate desire, but turns it down!!!! Dah! I know it's a movie, but [man]!! I don't want to wait for the [darn] sequal!!
0440219078|4.0|Jonas lives in world where everything is under control. Everything is planned out for everyone, and everyone is the same. If someone breaks a rule, they are released from the community. Jonas is selected to be the next 'Receiver of Memories' the person who gathers the memories of the past. This job includes pain, sorrow, and happiness. Jonas realizes that the world he lives in is not all that great after all.<br />I have heard that this book has been banned from some schools, and personally, I think that is ridiculous. These are the only reasons that the book has been banned: a 12 year old having sensual feelings toward a girl he likes, and injecting a deadly needle into someone who is being released. Ok, well the injecting is not really pleasant, but the reader does not need to focus on that. For this book focuses on more important issues that that.<br />The Giver gives an important message to people: Living in a world where there is independence and choices is better than living in a world where everything is perfect.<br /> Lois Lowry did an awesome job making this book. I like the way she always kind of hinted that the perfect world was not that good after all. I recommend this book to people ages 10 and up.<br />HAPPY READING!
B000002NJS|3.0|I don't really care for this album all that much. However, there seems to be this immortality complex lurking throughout it. From the opening line &quot;I traded fame for love/without a second thought&quot; one has to wonder what is Madonna's subtext here. This album was obviously inspired by the birth of Lourdes and that rings clear in songs like &quot;little star,&quot; but my favorite song has to be the title track. The lyrics are so sinsterly gothic while the music is young enough to revive Madonna's vampiric career. She sings &quot;Then gone for/someone else to be there...&quot; Then I think I'm hearing &quot;Through the endless years.&quot; I don't know why she covered that part up in the linear notes, unless she had something to hide, perhaps? Whatever the reason, the whole album makes me think Anne Rice whenever it comes into my life. She's flying, baby!
0525946284|4.0|Follett writes an engrossing tale of an undercover, all-female team on a mission to sabotage a German outpost in occupied France.  Gloss over the torture scenes if you don't have the stomach for it.  Otherwise, in true Follett format, this one is predictable, but fun.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I have been an absolute die-hard Harry Potter fan from the beginning. I read the first two books before they were even popular, and have since read all four of them a dozen times each. Not exagerrating. So you can imagine how psyched I was when I heard about the movie.<BR>I watched every trailer a million times. I was on the internet 24/7 searching for news. And I got my movie tickets five days in advance. I was there at the theatres on Nov. 16, and waited two hours for the film to start.<BR>It was great. I loved it. But there were some things that really ticked me off. First, a lot of time was spent on things that didn't need dwelling on...a lot of stupid lines and jokes were added, like Ron getting hit in the face with his broomstick, or Seamus' constant explosions. These aren't true to the humor in the book, and it took time away from things that should have been there. We also needed a lot more character development. I would sit in the theatre for 4 hours to watch that movie, as long as they made it good.<BR>Now for the actors. Daniel Radcliffe, though he's an absolute sweetie, was not perfect. He looks the part, but he was a bit weak througout the movie. He was REALLY good in the emotional scenes, though, and I think that makes up for it. Harry really is sort of an impossible role, as most of the book takes place in his head. Ron was perfect, i thought. I didn't quite agree with the way he looked, but the acting was altogether perfect. Hermione....well, I don't like Emma Watson at all, I think she seems like a little snot, so I might be biased. But I thought she really overplayed Hermione. Hermione should be kind hearted, self conscious, very intelligent, and a little bit bossy. Watson added a certain self confidence that Hermione doesn't have, made her an absolute know-it-all, and we didn't see much of the warmth that resides deep in Hermione's character. <BR>Albus Dumbledore...one of my favorite characters from the books. Hilarious, a bit crazy, wise, gentle,understanding...Richard Harris was none of these thngs. He was just an old man with a long white beard and glasses. All his funny lines were cut, except for the earwax one, of course. He was just far too stiff and strict and....ugh, horrible. Then again, I also hate Richard Harris, so....<BR>Well, at least Hagrid was perfect. Absolutely perfect in every way, shape, and form.<BR>The special effects oculd use a lot of work. Quidditch and the chess scene were excellent, but the centaur, the troll, the flying lesson with Neville...all horrible. Get some new CG animation guys, because that's just not gonna cut it. If Aragog and Dobby look like that, I might just puke....CoS is my favorite book.<BR>Don't think the movie's horrible, because it's not. I've just pointed out everything bad. It's actually quite wonderful and amazing...I love the costumes and sets. If it was good enough for me to go see 4 times, it can't be all that bad. Just my two cents, anyway...
B00000G3I1|3.0|There is a paradox about this movie. Although the actors are great, they are directed in a very cold way. You don`t know much about them and you feel even less. I should say most of them are caricatured rather than portrayed, except maybe for William Hurt, Jobeth Williams and Glenn Close). They make a believable crowd but you don`t care a dime what happens to them.<br />I did not find their grieving believable or moving at all (maybe because we never see Alex). The treatment of their past is very shallow : what is it that made them think they were great exactly ? The viewer is left to guess, or remember his/her own youth... What is is that make them feel they lost something with time ??<br />I have seen this movie 3 times and think it ages well, but it is shallow and rather pretentious. For true and poignant nostalgia, rent \\"Splendor in the Grass\\" with Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty... the antithesis.
B000002C1V|5.0|\\"The Final Cut\\", Roger Waters final album with Pink Floyd, is a true modern masterpiece. It's more than an album however - it is a requiem for the post war dream. What became of Britain after World War 2? Did we really learn anything from the war? What happened to the hopes and dreams of those who fought to save England? \\"Should we shout?! Should we scream?!\\" asks Waters to former-PM Maggie Thatcher. Each song contains powerful political and social themes, and are from the perspective of a returned veteran, a deceased servicemen, a member of the \\"war baby\\" generation (presumably Waters himself), and a shadowy on looker. The lingering issue of Waters own father's death during the war acts as a central motivation for themes presented here, but instead of \\"why was my daddy taken away from me?\\" as heard in \\"The Wall\\", it has become \\"what is the reason for war in the first place and what does it achieve?\\". Each song follows in a logical sequence, so it is essential that the album be listened to from start to finish to understand the \\"story\\" presented.<br />Musically, this is nothing like the \\"classic\\" Floyd sound. The obvious reason for this is the fact that Gilmour performs, but does not write any of the music, and that Rick Wright was not a member of the band anymore. Though this may turn some away, Gilmour's minimal presence increases the power of when he does actually play. Take \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" for instance - a moving orchestral piece, that suddenly comes to life with the explosion of Nick Mason's drums, and a rip-roaring Gilmour solo that is as expressive as Waters superb lyrics. The same goes for \\"Not Now John\\", though not penned by Gilmour, he play's and sings with incredible intensity - ... all that we've got to get on with these! Got to compete with the wily Japanese!\\" he growls whilst pulling off some vicious blues riffs. This would have to be the most explosive song in the Floyd cannon next to \\"One Of These Days\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\". Wright's absence however, is pretty noticible, but made slightly more bearable by Andy Bown's fine Hammond organ work. The orchestration by Michael Kamen is fantastic throughout, and captures perfectly the mood of each song. On the title track in particular, the intensity of his arrangement is overwhelmingly emotional. Special mention must be made also of Raphael Ravenscroft. His tenor sax work, though sparse, is incredibly powerful, particularly during \\"The Gunners Dream\\".<br />\\"The Final Cut\\" is Pink Floyd's most difficult work - equally disturbing, as it is comforting. There are moments when listen to it you feel as though you are floating through the clouds completely at peace, then all of the sudden you come crashing back to earth deeply saddened. \\"Through the fish eyed lens of tear stained eyes\\" Waters has composed a work of such intensity and emotion that is not to be dismissed by anyone under any circumstances.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album is great. I love the accompanying booklet. It shows the covers of the singles, plus it tells the dates each song was recorded, released in the UK and US and the dates and number of weeks it was Number One. Even though it doesn't have some great ones, like &quot;I am the Walrus,&quot; &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; or &quot;Revolution,&quot; you have to consider, this album is a collection of songs that reached Number One, so it wasn't just someone's opinion wether a song was considered a classic. I suppose they went strictly by the songs' chart positions. <BR>This album is special to me because it was the album that first got me into The Beatles and now I can't stop! This is a great album. The Beatles are the best.
B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel is amazing in this movie, watch this movie twice, the first time to catch the storyline and the 2nd time to actually rate the acting, and Denzel Washington is oscar material in this movie.  This movie shows you that the good cops have reasons to turn bad and unfortunately some of them do.  They get bigger than life on the streets, because they have the badge, but they also get too caught up in the money and power that they eventually will fall.  They bring protege's along and show them corrupt ways and if the rookie isn't careful and remember why they joined the force or the team, they will end up corrupt or dead.  This movie was real and the acting was totally outstanding.  A must see, and if you are a Denzel Washington fan, you will not even realize that this Denzel the good guy or the lover.  How many of our finest in blue or under cover are corrupt?... makes you wonder, watch the movie.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|2 years ago, I bought this album because of all the glowing reviews the critics put in.  And i listened to it occasionally, not really thinking of it significant... But then a couple weeks ago i was dusting off my old CD's and came across this one and decided to give it a spin.  I was blown away from hearing those same piano chords from &quot;on the bound&quot; and the creeping intro to &quot;limp&quot;... Fiona Apple is a great talent in music today, and will hopefully for a long time.  As i listened to this album more and more, there began to be more and more songs i absolutely adored- like &quot;Get Gone&quot;, with an awesome piano hook, bridge and chorus.  The album really shows off her maturity at such a suprisingly young age and shows all that she can do.  I can definately see why Entertainment Weekly named it the number 1 album of 1999, and places like rolling stone and music-critic.com giving it perfect reviews.  Its an album not to be questioned.
B000059XVS|3.0|The Lawrence of Arabia boxed set released by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment is based on a 1988 restoration of the film. This version omits some of the very best scenes from the original picture; specifically, the long, tense, horse &amp; camel charge on Akabar. The &quot;1988&quot; version only has about a 30 second mish-mash of footage from the original picture. There are also other shorter, less dramatic, but &quot;arguably&quot; important scenes missing from this version.<br />I only saw the movie for the first time in 1991. A restored version was being played in Austin, TX and a friend insisted that we simply had to go see it on the big screen. Needless to say, I loved it. But, my absolute favorite part was the charge on Akabar. When I bought the video, I actually fast-forwarded through to see the &quot;charge&quot;?! Imagine my suprise when it was not there. If you can find a more complete version than the one TriStar currently has available, I heartily recommend buying it instead of this current release. I wish I had.
B000000W6X|5.0|Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists.  They masterfully out-do themselves on every album (with their best album therefore being Mezzanine) and with slow songs, gradual climaxes, and heavy beats, its irresistable to an electronica fan.  There is no question that the best song on the album they put first, the title track, Protection.  Its a sweet song, with tracey thorn's smooth vocals (I cant change the way you feel, but i can put my arms around you) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats, at more than 6 minutes long.  No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I went to go see spiderman the first day it came out, and it was the best movie I have ever seen in my life!!!!!! Spider-man kicks [butt]!!! He is the best marvel hero in the world today and think you stan lee for making him, he rocks the world!! I am a big fan of the cartoon series. ...That movie is worth seeing twice and 3 and 4 and 5 times, it is the tightest movie there is in history. All the people that made it, they did a kick [butt] job. Spider-Man rules the world!!!
B000006O7C|4.0|lets face it guys, nothing can top \\"Grace\\". It is unquestionably one of the greatest rock albums of the 90's, if not of all time.  As he was recording this CD at the time of his death, it was interesting to see what they would put out for us, from him.  And the results are pretty good, but nowhere near to the greatness of Grace.  The melodies arent as distinguishing or original, and he doesnt experiment with his voice as much on this album.  Although these arent the finalized versions of the songs, and most of them (the 2nd album) are just demo's and what not.  Songs like \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" reminds us all of Jeff's great emotion in songs, but the magic of grace just isnt on this record.  If you are looking for something similar to Jeff Buckley, the group Ours' \\"Distorted Lullabies\\" is a great choice; he has a voice similar to Jeff, but of course nothing can come close to the prince of 90's rock.  with this review i leave you with one of my favorite quotes, that is in the liner notes of the booklet (which is also a very good booklet, with a word from his mother and record execs) \\"Our suffering is peeling off and revealing a brand new skin, a new power.  love heals all wounds and not just time alone.\\"
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have been a fan of No Doubt for years now and I love this new album!  It's a completley different sound and I think they pulled it off well.  I know a lot of No Doubt fans have been complaining about how it's a little more &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;trendy&quot; but, just enjoy the new sound!...I think the songs have great lyrics also!...Gwen has one of the best, most unique voice in music right now.  They also are GREAT in concert!  Some of my favorite songs on the album are, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Detective&quot;...even though I enjoy listening to the whole album.
B0000636UN|2.0|It seems like alot of bands are chaning their old styles and ways to compete for top 40 radio play and to sell more records.  This album without a doubt is her most poppy yet and has taken the path so many have taken these past couple months- like No Doubt, the Cranberries, etc.  the new single &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; is a great example, as it is one of her most happy radio-friendly singles to come out, probably ever from her.  The rest of the album is composed of simple lyrics and lack the depth of what we are used to, like from her greatest album &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;.  The rest of the album just sounds like pop pap... overall i was waiting for this record because we have come to set the bar high for miss Sheryl Crow- and she just turned 40 but she isnt really acting her age in the music.  This sounds like a debut record.
B000001Y79|5.0|This is the album that made No Doubt famous...well, more popular with the MTV, radio crowd.  This album has some classic songs on it!....\\"Don't speak\\", \\"Just a girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", \\"Sunday morning\\"!!!!  Those are some of my favorites also...oh, and \\"Different people\\" is good too!  All of the songs are...I have been listening to it for years!  Very different from all of their other albums....I give this one 5 stars!
B00005QDW1|4.0|So No Doubt decided to make things a little more poppy, fun, and radiofriendly, after 2000's disappointing sales-wise yet highly under rated &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;.  But their approach is pretty good. I wrote a review when the album came out, slamming this album for selling out to a TRL pop crowd even more, but the truth is they sold out a long time ago with Tragic Kingdom and the song &quot;Dont Speak&quot;.  But in a world of Britney Spears, if you are gonna get played on the radio and have 2 top 10 singles, (well, Hella Good is on its way) you mine as well mix some elements to make it creative, and that is what they have done here.  Hey Baby and Hella Good, although very plain and dull for No Doubt, adds a little bit of spice and differing elements to the radio.  Songs like &quot;Underneath it All&quot; are addictive, and could be huge hits at top 40 radio, and at the same time introducing true Reggae beats (sorry guys Shaggy doesnt cut it) back to the mainstream. So may No Doubt be happy in the music path they have chosen.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I bought this DVD on the first day it came out and it has been a favorite of mine ever since!...I saw it on HBO and lOVED IT!  I am a big fan of hers!...I have seen her 4 times now..and this summer will be the 5th!  This is her best, most theatrical tour yet and I really enjoyed seeing it twice.  Watching this DVD is like reliving the experience!...She sounds good, yes, it is live!..Just with a vocal track....she is a great dancer...and just a good entertainer all around.  This DVD features all of her hit songs and a lot of tracks from the new album &quot;Britney&quot; which by the way, is her best!...If your a Britney fan, or just enjoy seeing a great show, buy this DVD, you won't be dissapointed!
B00004T9UF|3.0|It's almost impossible to review the MM LP without relating it to its predecessor, so I'll start out with that. The reason the Slim Shady LP was amazing was because there was an air about it that felt like it was a struggle between Marshall Mathers and the insane Slim Shady, on tracks like Guilty Conscience and Role Model you could hear Slim taking over, but in spots of My Fault and Brain Damage there were glimmers of the more sane and ridiculed Marshall. The two entities battling each other gave the album depth and a feeling of chaos, making it fascinating to listen to.<br />Here, Em has gone further towards the Slim Shady side, but rather than keeping him a deranged character, he's melded him with Marshall into just another hatemonger, albeit one with amazing rhyming skills. The album doesn't manage to portray the tension between Marshall and Slim that the original did, and because of this the tracks sound confused at best. Em has lost the loose feeling of rhymes that made him unique, on The Way I Am and Real Slim Shady his rhymes fall perfectly on the beat. The only song that sounds like the old CD is Stan. But that song, while haunting and well done, shatters the ideas of Slim being out of control, showing that Em is acutely aware of what he's doing, writing yet another song to make sure everyone know that it's all a joke, yet songs like Criminal seem to function only to make fun of gays....  It almost sounds like he's having a tough time putting together the deep songs of the SS LP and is resorting to filling up his CDs with good beats but flat, dare I say, plots to his songs. The CDs are stories, at least the first was. This is just a collection of songs. I can only hope that the Eminem Show goes back to the old style, but I doubt it.
B000002B2X|5.0|I am new to Alice in Chains, because I never really got that big into grunge, even though I love heavey music. I recommed this to anyone. The Lyrics are great and all the songs are equally melodic. Much different then the \\"Drit\\" LP.<br />I will certainly buy alot more of Alice In Chains work. Sadly I just found out about the death of Layne. (R.I.P)
B000008COG|4.0|1988's BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO is a great imporvement upon its predecessor, FLY ON THE WALL. It has the team of Harry Vanda &amp; George Young taking the realms of production again. The resulta was a in-your-face production featuring 10 good tunes, none of them exceptional, but all of them sheer AC/DC. Of course the band could have beneffited from having a better singer than Johnson, but... Also strange is how low is the volume of CLiff WIlliams bass here. Never before or after it was so buried in the mix like in BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|Am I the only chosen one?  Com'on America stop lying, Ali's character was terrible, unconvincing, and downright unjustable to the greatest boxer of all time. The fight scenes which were supposed to be high points in the movie appeard to be low budget acting in addition to poor sound editing. The tough, straught, fearsom fighter I learned about growing up was portrayed as a 'milk it' fighter in the movie who wore his opponents out by lying on the ropes.  The only emotional times in the movie I found was Malcom X's parts.  Ordinary Van Peebles doesn't fit the character, but his truly great acting abilities become more convincing throughout the movie. I wanted to see if Van Peebles would shift the movie matter to Malcom X, and he perfectly did that with only two three sentence parts by using emotion.  When he was nervous about asking Ali to go to Africa, when he spoke about his frustrations about the girls in the church bombings(which I found an emotional high point in the movie, that Smith correctly misunderstands-more human nature between a boxer and a person of high muslim statute),when he began to be shut out of his religious community up to his assatination.  Its at that point you feel a sense of sick low and confusion for the rest of the movie.  Now, tell me about an Ali fight that we havn't seen.  Tell me something about this movie that we haven't known about for almost half a century.  Usually when we watch a very good documenarative movie, they usually show the traits that kept a person to be so great.  I read in a book a long time ago, that when Ali was little he had just missed his school bus, so he ran to school and beat the bus.  When did he start fighting?, what things made him the unordinary fighter or ordinary fighter before he became the greatest?  If I was Ali, I wouldn't have it.  But what ya gonna do, the deal was already done.

B00005JKCF|5.0|There's one word to describe this movie... WOW!  It was really good.  The movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time!  You never lost intrest!  It was amazing, and  you felt like you were swinging off of buildings with Spider-Man.  It was amazing!!!!!  I've never read any Spider-Man comic books or anything, but I really enjoyed this movie!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I'm in complete agreement and somehow disappointed at the reviews I've seen so far.  As an ex-field geologist, I appreciate the beauty of a good mood album, especially good \\"on the road\\" CDs.  Martin Sexton's \\"Black Sheep\\" is perfect for bouncing along alone on desert roads feeling a combination of road thrill and homesickness.  Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" is the quintessential \\"everone's asleep in the truck and you're enjoying the cold night air coming in through the window\\" CD.  And of course, Steve Miller's \\"Greatest Hits\\" is requisite for any early morning off-roading.  But the fact that these CDs fit a particular mood doesn't in any way make them simple atmospheric filler. Same thing goes for the Norah Jones CD.  Yes, when I hear it I picture myself in a big comfy chair on a sunny Sunday morning on a screened porch in the Catskills, sipping a good strong coffee, petting an aging yellow lab and reflecting on my life (delete tracks 4 and 9 and hit repeat and you're good to go for this little fantasy)...nothing wrong with feeling that way.  But let's leave the Enya-esque Starbucks comparisons behind.  The production on this album is brilliant.  I challenge you to take three-piece sexy lounge jazz, contemporary college-station pop, classic blues idioms, throw in some lesser known standards with a country feel and somehow come out with a perfectly flowing and coherent 45 minute set.  Norah somehow controls and reconciles this mix of styles with her sensual honeyed vocals (okay maybe a little more attractive to the men in the crowd...there is an incredible sexiness to it after all).  But I don't want to undermine what she does with these tracks by focusing on the sweetness of it all.  Norah's vocals are skillful and controlled.  I'm almost sorry this CD is so popular on the college-station circuit because it's so much more inspired than some of the flash-in-the-pan stuff out there.  And please for chrissakes, comparing this to Shelby Lynn?...not even close. <BR>As a lover of more blues-based music, I particularly enjoy \\"Turn Me On\\" and \\"One Flight Down\\".  I hope Norah explores this a bit more in future recordings.  The hint of raspiness she doses the former with (listen carefully to the opening line) is very nice but you get the feeling she's capable of opening up a bit if she felt like it.  I think she's cheating us a little in order to stay consistent with the feel of this album.  You definitely get the feeling there's a lot more there we're not hearing yet.<BR>If anything I've mentioned in this review appeals to you then I urge you to pick up this CD.  It's very rare that an entire album lives up to the promise of the radio tracks.  If you've heard \\"Come Away With Me\\" and \\"Don't Know Why\\" already and liked 'em, I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKNF|4.0|\\"Gosford Park\\" (2001)<br />I was very excited about this motion picture. Not only had it received 9 BAFTA nominations, 7 Academy Award nominations and 1 Oscar to take home, but if you take a look at its cast (which includes Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon, Bob Balaban and many other very famous actors) and director (highly acclaimed Robert Altman) you'll also see why. I liked this movie but I do not think it is Oscar material. It had its share of great points and not-so-great ones, but was still a very credible piece of filmmaking.<br />Altman won a Golden Globe statuette for his directing efforts in Gosford Park and proved to me he still has the magic touch that many directors lose when they get to his age (he is an amazing 77 years old and still going strong). He conducts his gigantic cast magnificently, pulling excellent performances out of each. The film also has great execution and terrific atmosphere, which is mostly thanks to his strong enthusiasm and quality directing.<br />The baffling cast is one of the strongest ensembles of 2001. Most of the attention has gone to actresses Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith, who were very plausible in their difficult roles (not that they are that difficult for these wonderful female actors). However, I thought they were both surprisingly underused. Mirren pops in and out of the camera shots for most of the film but her acting at the end of the film is marvellous. Smith is funny but I wanted to see more of her.<br />I thought that some of the other actors in the film like Kristin Scott Thomas (always brilliant), Ryan Phillipe (who surprised me with a stunning accent and performance - his first real breakthrough to adult films), Emily Watson (terrific yet again) and especially Kelly MacDonald who is the anchor of the film. Credit must also go to Stephen Fry and Michael Gambon who look a lot alike and both give hugely enjoyable performances in minor roles. <br />The setting of this film is one of the best I've seen ina while. What could possibly be better than a grand old house to be the centrepiece of a stylish film reminiscent of an Agatha Christie whodunit story? Very cool. Most of the movie is inside and I think there were about 3 scenes that were held outside of the terrific house. Altman is good with this setting though, he gives us like a grand tour of the house and I eventually got to know where the servants lived and bathed, and where the upper-class guests stayed.<br />I think there were a couple of things that had me a little displeased and slightly disappointed about Gosford Park. There are no particularly memorable sequences or scenes in the film. What annoyed me is that I couldn't look back on the film after leaving the theatre and say \\"oh, that part was the best\\" or \\"that part I will remember for a long time\\". It was forgettable and sometimes boring. The baffling mystery kept me guessing (I got the guess right, but no the motive) because the killer in the movie could be anyone. The climax of the movie was sort of really unsuspenseful and disappointing, I was saying to myself \\"is that it?!\\"<br />All in all Gosford Park movie worked. It had a great script to work with that included terrific character development and brilliantly written dialogue. However, I got uninterested too often and I think a couple of scenes could've been chopped off. Some of the stories in the film were just tedious. I don't Gosford Park deserved so much BAFTA or Oscar attention, but it was original and well-done enough and I enjoyed myself.<br />MY GRADE: B

B000028U0Y|5.0|It's hard to imagine that this record could be topped. It's the combination of great music plus the emotions from the special setting that send a chill down your spine every time you listen to this record. The sequel &quot;At San Quentin&quot; has a considerably different character. Folsom Prison, however, must be THE place where Johnny Cash really wanted to perform. This re-issued recording sounds as genuine and honest as one can possibly imagine. What a tribute to Johnny Cash's 70th birthday!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is absolutely the hottest new songwriter around.  Musically he can be a little repetitive, but his voice and lyrics are so compelling it doesn't really matter.  I'm very excited to hear from this rising star.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Well, after having read all the rave reviews about this record, I finally bought it as well. But while I do give it 5 stars, I would give &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; 7 if I could. The San Quentin record just does not permeate that original, rough and tough feeling from beginning to the end. It is particularly the beginning and the end that seem too &quot;streamlined&quot;. It's where you get the impression of a TV show instead of a performance for the inmates of a prison. It's only from song number 4 (&quot;I walk the line&quot;) that Johnny Cash's powerful voice really begins to shine. In fact, you can hardly hear him say &quot;Hello I'm Johnny Cash&quot; at the beginning. I guess what I do not like about this record is the &quot;big band&quot; sound that tends to drown Cash's voice at times. It's a great record, no doubt about it. But every time I listen to the &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; recording, I get that chill running down my spine. Here, &quot;At San Quentin&quot; that just does not happen. It's as if there was more of a distance between the singer and his audience, the inmates. Even most of the dialogs sound more like a routine (just compare, e.g. the remarks about the tin cups).<BR>In addition, this record crosses over from country into gospel, (most notable with &quot;He turned the water into wine&quot;) which may be another reason why &quot;At San Quentin&quot; has a softer feel to it.
B00005JKCF|4.0|\\"Spider Man\\" the movie was thoroughly Marvel Comics.  The refrain of the movie was the line, \\"with great power comes great responsibility.\\"  The point is driven home by Peter Parker learning this his inaction when he had the chance to stop a thief led to the thief having the chance to kill his uncle, Ben.  The message - every moral slip comes back in spades.  Life is also presented as a series of moral choices - save the girl, or save the busload of children?  Failure to resolve the moral dilemma is giving in to the dark side, total corruption and insanity.  I absorbed much of this philosophy reading Marvel Comics in high school, and this way of looking at the world has become engrained upon my outlook.  Never strive for absolute power because power corrupts.  The \\"great responsibility\\" is not just to use the power justly, but to avoid the temptations of power.  Altogether this is not a bad philosophy.<br />The movie falls short in dealing with this philosophy twice.    The most obvious instance is when Spider Man is given the choice about the bus and the girl and, using his super powers, he managed to save both and get away with it.  This is cheating, I think.  He didn't really have to make the choice.  There really was no dilemma.  <br />The second was subtler.  There's a scene when Spider Man arrives at the scene of a burning building and rescues a baby that the NYFD was unable to.  NYPD on the scene want to arrest Spider Man, and watch helplessly as he goes back into the building to do what they can't, save another life.  I couldn't help but think of September 11th and the concept of the NYPD and FD as the real heroes.  Couldn't the scene have been engineered so that a firefighter saved Spider Man?  Or even so that we see firefighters saving some people and Spider Man just helping out?  The scene was a set up for a battle, so I don't think the idea of Spider Man being the only one capable of helping was incumbent upon the scene.  <br />This runs afoul of the Marvel Philosophy in several respects.  The first is that it emphasizes Spider Man's individuality as opposed to him being on anyone's side.  While Spider Man has always been somewhat solitary, there are countless comic book team ups between Spider Man and everyone else in the Marvel Universe.  That most Marvel heroes are part of a team - The X Men, the Fantastic Four, The Avengers, suggests something about the importance of teamwork and the message that \\"We may be different, but at least there is a `we.'\\"<br />The other problem with this scene is that it is a missed opportunity to set up another choice.  Spider Man acts because he has no choice.  He's the only one who can go in and save the person inside.   It may have worked better if he started showing a messiah complex and then got swatted down.  There was no lesson in this scene, except that the NYPD and NYFD are not the real heroes after all.<br />But these two flaws were aberrations.  On the whole the movie's philosophy not only held together, but proved to be much more practical and meaningful than placeholder philosophies in most action movies.
0553239481|4.0|Any cognizant member of the human race can answer a question that begins \\"Where were you when ...?\\" The memorable event is largely defined by nationality, culture and interests. For instance I recollect where I was when JFK was shot, when the Berlin Wall came down, and when the WTC towers were destroyed. On the other hand, I can't say the same about when John Lennon was shot or when Princess Di was killed. With millions of others worldwide, I remember that day in July 1969 when one of our species first set foot on another world and our planet figuratively held its breath to watch and listen. We shall not again see that degree of universal interest until, perhaps, there's a manned Mars mission. There were Armstrong and Aldrin on the Moon's surface, of course. But who was the guy left orbiting in the Command Module?<br />CARRYING THE FIRE is by Michael Collins, the poor devil left behind while his two colleagues rocketed off to most of the glory. In his book, Collins provides a narrative history of his time in the U.S. Air Force from his early days as a test pilot at the Edwards and Nellis test centers in the California desert, to his selection as a NASA astronaut (on his second application), to the training for and flight of Gemini 10, and finishing with Apollo 11 and the effects of that mission on his subsequent life.<br />CARRYING THE FIRE is a solid, relatively dead-pan, and competently written look at America's astronaut training and the experience of being \\"in space\\", or at least to the degree experienced by the author. Spending his adult life as an engineering test pilot, surely the most glamorous job for a techno-nerd type, it's to Michael's credit that he's penned a book as readable as this. During those later chapters in which he shares the Apollo 11 experience, the volume nearly becomes one that is difficult to put down. Not quite, but almost.<br />\\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\\" has always struck me as one of the least inspiring famous lines ever spoken. Jeez, who wrote Armstrong's material? (It's so inane that I can't even find the full text of the statement in the edition of LIFE magazine issued to commemorate the event, so maybe I have it wrong.) I only mention this because what was very evident in Michael's narrative was the drabness of the non-technical communications among the Apollo 11 astronauts themselves and between them and Mission Control, as least as recorded for posterity by the author. Even the banter falls flat. Perhaps this is a factor of the no-nonsense, test pilot approach to business, or perhaps it was an effort by NASA to keep it appropriate for family listening. It didn't sound like our three heroes had much fun. To be fair, however, there is one photo in CARRYING THE FIRE captioned \\"Do you see what I see?\\" that perhaps gives evidence to a Collins sense of humor after all.<br />For anyone wishing to know more about that day almost 33 years ago - gosh, has it been that long? - when America stood taller and prouder than any day before or since, then I recommend this book.famous lines ever spoken.

B00000AFDW|2.0|OK, this album/Cd has been out for a few years now.  I bought it when it initially came out and have not listed to it much, but pulled it out today and gave it another shot.  My thoughts on it are about the same as when it came out....side 1 is good and stands by itself as good as it gets to being \\"classic\\" Kiss, or at least the 90's version.  The Ace tune \\"Into the Void\\" is the real highlight, and even Paul's Anthem \\"Pledge..\\" is good if not a bit light lyrically.<br />Side 2 is where the problems start.  OK I will be frank.  It is pure [disappointment] etc., you get my drift.  The 2 Paul songs sound like they belong on the mid-late 80's \\"hair band\\" version of Kiss.  The Peter Criss ballad is just plain horrible and a [disappointing] attempt at recreating \\"Beth\\".  The only song on side 2 worth mentioning is \\"Journey of 1000 Years\\".  I love it...I am also a big fan of Prog rock so this is probably why.  Very Beatles like with big bass...crank it up and see what I am talking about!  but unfortunately this one excellent track does not make a record.  <br />I am really ashamed to admit that I bought this album, and think Kiss could have done lots better.  Shame on Gene $immons for brining in outside musicians to replace Peter and Ace.  Your scheme backfired on you I hate to say.
B00005AXEL|3.0|I'm glad Stevie Nicks cleaned up her life and prevailed, but these are not the songs of her prolific and creatively satisfying days as a central member of Fleetwood Mac and the great songwriting duo, Buckingham Nicks.  You'll have to go back 25 years for that.<br />A truly great song is immediately recognizable for its lyrics and melody.  It can cross genre, instrumentation, and arrangement and still hold its own.  It tells truths we can all relate to and evoke an emotional response.  Maybe that's why so many of the greatest songs are about love, the #1 universal emotion.  While these songs are about love (mostly love gone wrong and liaisons that only looked like love), there aren't any great tunes here.  No doubt hardcore Stevie fans will find much to latch onto here; after all, you can still be seduced by Stevie's voice, her obligatory hokey lyrics, and the massive overproduction of the tunes. But there's no \\"Landslide,\\" \\"Gold Dust Woman,\\" or even \\"Stop Dragging my heart around\\" on this disk.  \\"I Miss You\\" offers the most promise on the entire disk.  Her heart's in this tune, and it shows.  Otherwise, the Welsh Witch is playing it safe.<br />I borrowed this CD from the public library, so it didn't cost me anything.  Take the same path and give this CD a listen before putting down [the money].  You may find that it's not worth the money.  Instead, pick up the now-classic *Buckingham Nicks* and *Rumors* with Fleetwood Mac to experience Stevie at her creative best.
0385505833|5.0|I have recently just hopped on the John Grisham wagon and have enjoyed his lawyer type books.  If you appreciate a change of pace from a great writer this book is a must read.  Grisham takes what we put ourselves through every year at Christmas and makes fun of it all.  More than once I looked back and thought, &quot;That is so true!&quot; and laughed not only at the characters but at myself.
6305428220|5.0|OK, let's start by getting the bad out of the way. The plot of the Faculty is one of the oldest chestnuts in science fiction - the &quot;aliens are taking over the town by stealing people's bodies&quot; schtick. And at several points the script descends into unbelievability - not the suspended disbelief of a good science fiction movie, but the &quot;where the heck did that come from?&quot; disbelief that can often take you right out of the swing of the movie.<br />Now the good - and there's considerably more of this than of the bad. The script is well-written and witty, and handles the problems mentioned above in stride. As you might expect from a movie written by Kevin Williamson, there's plenty of genre-referential humor and often dry wit. The acting is uniformly good, including several well-known stars (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Robert Patrick, and Famke Janssen). Some of the lesser-known actors, especially the teen ones, also shined - Clea Duvall as outsider Stokely, Jordana Brewster as popular girl Delilah, and Laura Harris (who at first I thought was Kirsten Dunst) as southern belle Marybeth. The special effects, while still obviously B-movie, are good enough that they don't detract from the film.<br />The film adeptly uses the motif of an alien invasion as a metaphor for life in high school - for example, the aliens offer the six main teens (the only ones still human in the town) the chance to truly &quot;fit in&quot; by giving up their individuality. By fighting back, the teens confirm their individuality. This device has been used often by Joss Whedon (another noted teen-scribe) in his TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer; fans of that show will probably want to see this film, if for no other reason than Clea &quot;Invisible Girl Marcie&quot; Duvall's starring role.<br />While the movie suffers from many of your typical sci-fi B movie cliches, the writing and acting deftly overcomes those handicaps and is a stylishly funny combination of sci-fi B movie and teen movie that fans of both genres will enjoy.en movie that fans of both genres will enjoy.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have to say Spider-Man is one of the most refreshing comic book hero movies to ever come out. When I was a young kid, I was a huge Spider-Man fan with the action figures and comic books. As time went on and as I grew older I forgot about him, but that changed when I saw the previews for this movie. I finally saw the movie tonight and it brought back those care free days I had as a kid. Seeing Spider-Man was just one of the most amazing movie experiences (along with E.T.) ever. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did an amazing job. He brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. Another great performance was by KIRSTEN DUNST who brought the Lois Lane like quality to this movie, and gave one of her best movie performances to date. Together the two just ignited the big screen and as the sparks flew it gave the movie a romantic twist. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, thats what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride i highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the Hype of this movie. I went to see it cause I wanted to. SPIDER-MAN is breaking Box Office Records! Spider-Man was the #1 Movie at the box Office for the weekend of May 4-5 and had the largest opening gross ever its first week with $118 million. It broke another record in its second week of release on May 11-12 with grossing $72 million, which is the most any movie has ever grossed on its second week, and if thats not enough it is the fastest movie to pass the $200 million mark in only 9 days. I can see why because this movie is just AWESOME! I will be waiting in line when SPIDER-MAN comes out on DVD! Check Spider-Man out! Tobey and Kirstin you both rock!ine when SPIDER-MAN comes out on DVD! Check Spider-Man out! Tobey and Kirstin you both rock!
B000000OAN|3.0|Sorry, but what is all the hoopla about this album?  The only good songs are Bohemian Rhapsody, You're My Best Friend, and Love of My Life.  The first two you can get on their greatest hits albums.  The rest of the songs are just plain silly and lack real musical talent.  The Game is clearly their best album, not this piece of garbage.  Save your money for Greatest Hits and The Game.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I did not get a chance to see this in the theaters, and I had heard mostly negative comments about it, particularly the beginning.  I am old enough to remember when movies took the time to introduce you to the characters, and build up the plot. Special effects were part of the movie, not the entire movie.<br />Maybe that's why this is 2 DVDs, because the special effects are outstanding, but so is the story line. The entire movie was excellent, in my opinion. I did not find it boring or slow. My wife and I enjoyed every moment of it, and we're glad we now own it. It's a great time to buy, since the price has dropped, and it's a &quot;must have&quot; for your DVD collection.
B000065U1N|5.0|...this movie is nonfiction.  I actually spoke to friends in the forces who really loved this movie strictly for its realism.  Therefore, I believe that this movie needs to be rated for its accuracy and screenplay, which I personally thought were excellent.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Don't expect the Odyssey, but expect a very clever movie.  Lot's of fun and you'll enjoy seeing it over and over. The entire cast is incredible, and the songs linger in your mind for days afterward. I bought the CD as well as the DVD, just to be able to listen to it in my car.<br />My wife enjoyed it as much as I did, which really surprised me. She was doubtful, at first, but barely into the film she was hooked. She enjoyed the bluegrass music too, and she has never cared for that type of sound before. <br />Although it's not THE Odyssey, it is AN odyssey, a winding story-adventure. I was surprised that George Clooney could pull it off. Some of the lip-synching was off, with the voice not matching the character.  All in all, we found it a very good movie, and still watch it from time to time.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This movie is ripe ripe ripe for DVD release!  In a time when movies are all but drown in CGI special effects and shed only mere crumbs of atmosphere in comparison to this flick, it's time for \\"The Fog,\\" to come \\"rolling\\" in on DVD.  The comment made about this being a \\"great film for film students,\\" could not be anymore true!  John Carpenter was the master at creating creepy visuals without using a lot of sound effects.  Many of the sound effects you do here in John Carpenters earlier works are simple, short and spooky as hell!  Unfortunately, by today's Hollywood standards lots of blood and unnecessary dialogue is necessary and effective to convolute a second rate story. (Joke)  The horror genre is far from dead but it's gonna take someone to learn a thing or two from movies like \\"The Fog,\\" to bring those attributes to life.  Amazon.com and the powers that be, bring this movie to DVD NOW!!!  It's time for a new generation of viewers to take notice of this brilliant and highly effective horror film!
B00003CXA2|5.0|My wife talked me into ordering this DVD. I wanted some other items, but she insisted. I had forgotten how good this movie is, and there is a wealth of background information about the filming and the characters in the DVD 'Special Features' section.<br />Tom Hanks *IS* Forrest Gump in this movie. (What a talented actor. How can he master all these different roles?) Forrest Gump is so simple on the inside that it makes you wonder why life can't be more like his character.  Of course, his blind luck plays a big part in it also ;-) Sally Field is equally brilliant, and another really great actor. (well, except for that Smokey and the Bandit era).  <br />The way that they weave Forrest into all the historic film footage is revealed in the &quot;special features&quot; section, which is a little movie in itself. <br />It's a classic, and should be part of your collection.

Who cares? It's their loss.<br />I bought this DVD without seeing the movie, which I don't do very often, but when I read that it won at Sundance, that it has &quot;backwards&quot; plot and learned that it didn't earn more than 25 million at the box office (which is  actually a lot with this budget, but low enough to know that it's not for the masses), I knew it had to be good. <br />Of course, it may be too smart and confusing for an average viewer, but if you like original work with substance that doesn't provide all the answers for you at once, then this is for you... <br />Plot in two sentences: a man kills another man. Going backwards in intervals of 10-15 minutes we find out why...<br />The thing everybody overlooks is the fact that by going backwards you really get to understand how the main character feels, since he hasn't the capacity of turning short term memories into long term memory...<br />DVD itself is superb. Special Features are loaded. By going through all of them you'll see what lenghts the filmakers went in trying to make the charachters believable and the story to check out... You also can read the original story on which the movie was based on. <br />And finally, there is supossedly a secret function that plays the scenes in chronological order, rather than backwards.<br />Fantastic!<br />Favourite line: &quot;What am I doing here? Oh, I'm chasing this guy...&quot;
B00005JKCF|5.0|As I entered the crowded movie theater I felt nervous. As a big fan of Spiderman and all his friends at Marvel comics, I wasn't sure if the movie would live up to my expectations. As the ending credits started to roll, I sat there in a state of awe. It was a great movie! It had everything: Adventure, action, comedy, and romance. Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Paker a.k.a. SPIDERMAN! I gave to admit, there could of been more action, but it was still worth seeing. I'm not the kind of person to see a movie twice in a movie theater...but Spiderman is one of those movies that one wouldn't mind seeing over and over and over again....

0140185232|5.0|In his book, \\"The Razor's Edge,\\" W. Somerset Maugham tells the story of Larry Darrell, a young man he meets through his friend and international socialite Elliot Templeton.  Elliot's niece, Isabel, was engaged to Larry at one point, but settled on marrying Gray Maturin, an up and coming business-man from a very well-to-do family.  Elliot was extremely materialistic, and his sole purpose in life was to be accepted and mingle with the wealthiest and most powerful members of society.  Isabel and Gray were equally superficial and Larry's lack of motivation in pursuing a career was what sparked her to break off her engagement and marry Gray.  Having returned from the war, Larry had lost his best friend, and was disillusioned with life and its' meaning.  He was disinterested in pursuing material wealth but rather chose to seek enlightenment by reading, learning and traveling.  Elliot and Isabel did not understand Larry's motivations and purpose and simply thought that the obvious purpose and meaning of life was to work, make money, and gain social status.  Elliot, having lived by these tenants, had a great deal of money when he died, but lived his life for a futile cause.  Larry on the other hand was able to gain true enlightenment and learned what his true purpose was.  Therefore Elliot Templeton, after striving all of his life to be somebody, died a sad old man, alone and with only Somerset as his true friend.  On the contrary, Larry, who knew the limitations of material and social wealth, sought out his purpose by seeking enlightenment, which when attained, served as an intangible, priceless, asset, that could not be erased with age, poverty, or the market crash of 1929.  <BR> Eliot Templeton was born in the United States, but chose to live in Europe for most of his life.  He traveled where the jet set traveled and did what the upper class did.  He had no other purpose but to impress the most prestigious and wealthiest people in the world.  He dined at the finest restaurants (Maxim's, Paris), stayed at the most prestigious hotels (Claridges, London), and gave the most delectable parties imaginable.  At first glance, it seems like a lifestyle that everyone strives for.  In fact, when conjuring up the notion of the \\"American Dream,\\" one thinks of fine homes, cars and the best of everything.  However, Elliot Templeton dies a lonely man in Antibes, France without any of the friends he gave parties for, introduced into society, and did countless favors for.  He had lived his life chasing an image, without finding any substance behind that image.  He befriended people, and invited them to luncheons not because he enjoyed their company or they were good people.  Rather, he paid respect to them because of their title, social status, or popularity at the time.  Elliot symbolizes an empty image that looks good from the outside but lacks substance and is therefore hollow on the inside.  Templeton strives his entire life to be accepted socially, only to be rejected by society on his deathbed.  Further, he is infuriated, and simply doesn't understand why Larry would refuse his assistance in introducing him into French society.  He is completely blind to what the meaning of life is outside social status.  Upon his death, Somerset thinks, \\"It made me sad to think how silly, useless, and trivial his life had been.  It mattered very little now that he had gone to so many parties and had hobnobbed with all of those princes, dukes, and counts.  They had forgotten him already.\\" (241) Therefore Elliot Templeton's life was centered on superficiality and even his spiritual convictions to the Church had social motivations.  He never discovered the deep and profound meaning of life and died an old and lonely man, fulfilled only that he had been invited to the party of the year by, \\"that bitch.\\"  On the other hand, Larry Darrell, even though several years Elliot`s junior, had the wisdom and courage to seek out his unanswered questions about life.    <BR>Larry Darrell's parent both died when he was young and a family friend, Dr. Nelson raised him.  Larry very much enjoyed to fly and so joined the air force and fought in world war one.  In the war, his best friend, after saving his life, died.  Seeing his best friend, young and full of life die changed Larry forever.  When coming back to the U.S., he decided to dedicate his life to \\"loafing,\\" which in reality meant he wanted to search for the meaning of life.  He couldn't reconcile and fathom that an omnipotent and all good God, would allow evil to exist in the world.  He viewed his friend's death as the ultimate act of evil, and set out to answer these questions by traveling and learning.  Unfortunately for Louisa, he wasn't willing to take a job Gray's father had offered him and settle down.  This is the route that Elliot, Louisa's mother, Louisa, and pretty much every-one of his friends wanted Larry to take.  However, Larry could not let go of his urge and leave these troubling questions unanswered.  So, Larry embarked on a lifelong journey to answer the questions that plagued him, and was ultimately able to find answers to his questions.  After being enlightened in India, material wealth meant nothing to him.  He meditated, read, and listened to his Yogi for several years until one day, when watching the sunrise, he had \\"The awesome experience.\\"  Larry recounted that what he felt at the time was unexplainable.  It forever changed the course of his life.  This revelation shows that the questions that seem to be unanswerable can in reality be answered.  For as long as mankind has existed, people have pondered why evil exists, and what the purpose of humanity is.  These questions can be answered if one is willing to find an answer.  Larry did not allow anything to discourage his decision to find out the truth.  Even though he loved Isabel and very much wanted to marry her, he forwent that opportunity to search for the truth.  Unfortunately, our society places too much emphasis on material wealth and status and that was represented by Elliot, Gray and Isabel.  <BR> Ironically, when the stock market crashed in 1929, Gray's father died of a heart attack and Gray had a nervous break down.  They had worked hard their entire lives, and devoted everything they could imagine to one thing and that was money.  Having made enough to last several generations, they did not stop, and greed dictated their actions.  However, Somerset shows that when one invests themselves fully into something material, it can be taken away and when that happens, your life is taken away.  That is what happened to Gray's father.  It is not until Larry empowers Gray with the ability to cure himself of the excruciatingly painful headaches that Gray is able to work again.  Therefore, Gray, also having invested his entire self into his father's business would have ended up like his father had he not come across Larry and been partially enlightened by him.  Even though Elliot survives the market crash unscathed, his attachment was more to social-status and acceptance by the jet-set rather than wealth.  Therefore, Elliot devotes his life to something that can easily be taken away.  He devotes his life to the jet setters of the world, and at the end, dies rejected by them.  It is only Larry who devotes his life to the non-pretentious goals of bettering himself through travel, and education.  Ultimately, through his experiences, he is able to gain inner peace for himself by attaining enlightenment...an intangible asset that cannot be taken away. <BR> Throughout life, we are all bombarded with images of wealth and prosperity.  It is commonly thought that without these material objects, happiness cannot be attained.  Our society is superficial and filled with these notions of false-happiness.  However, if one could have enough courage as Larry, to go against everything society, his friends, and family told him and to seek out life and true happiness, society as a whole would be better off and happier.  On the contrary, the larger proportion of society, like Elliot Templeton, spend their entire lives striving to be something that in itself is meaningless and without substance.  Further, when greed takes over, like it did for the Maturin's, precious life is sacrificed for the dollar.  Inevitably, a balance must be struck between the two.  One could seek out material comfort and seek out true enlightenment.  The question lies in if these two concepts, material comfort and enlightenment are compatible or if one makes the other impossible.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This piece of high-tech CGI [junk] was shown on TV just recently and as a big Star Wars fan I said: \\"Let's give it another try, maybe I hyped it too much the first time. Maybe my expectations were too high...\\"<br />Nope. I was right. This [stinks] even more on second viewing. There won't be a third...<br />As a screenwriter wannabe, I read that you have to make villains smart and heroes smarter. Also, villains get all the lucky breaks in the final conflict. Heroes don't get any and that's what make them heroes - winning without luck or referee's help. This makes you feel satisfied in the end.<br />Having said that, in Phantom Menace the hero (Anakin) destroys the evil mothership by pure chance. <br />Oh, wait! Maybe he got the lucky break in advance because he becomes evil Darth Vader later... Yeah, right! <br />Look George, I know this is a movie for kids, a 2-hour toy commercial, a moneymaking machine for you so that ILM can develop complete virtual reality CGI movie that will need no actors, but still... There is no way you can atone for this lack of respect for the fans of your work. If you wanted to make money you just had to publish Episodes IV, V and VI on DVD.<br />So there. And since hope springs eternal, I hope Episode II will be better (which won't be that hard, looking at this mess)...

6304698542|5.0|This is one of the most amazing movies to experience on DVD.  The detail in each shot is outstanding and the DVD version only enhances it.  The film stands on its own as simply one of the best and most awarded films of all-time.  Winner of 8 deserved Academy Awards, the film beat out The Godfather in just about every catagory except Best Picture.  It simply shows no signs of age.  This is one of the few films that could be released today and still create the same frenzy it did in 1972.  Bob Fosse was truly a genius and master craftsman and it's hard to think of what would have happened to this film in anyone else's hands.  Liza Minnelli's performance is nothing short of a revelation.  She creates a character so self-absorbed that it doesn't matter how brilliant she is onstage (and she truly does become a star in front of our eyes), she lives for whatever moment is happening - as long as she's having fun.<BR>This film is one that should be required viewing for film students and anyone interested in how to make a movie musical.  It rarely gets any better than this.
B000059TPN|4.0|Michael Bay's action-fest is an exciting, if not always original entry into the Bay/Bruckheimer cannon. This Alcatraz flick starring Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage is fun, but where's the plot?<br />The trick is not to give the audience a breather to catch the seams. That and to really overdo the premise. The bad guys are the coverts' kind of covert, led with square-jawed nobility by Ed Harris (straight man to Connery's dry cracks and Cage's tomfoolery), whose renegade Marines hijack Alcatraz and train rockets, laced with ultra lethal chemical bath drops, on San Francisco. Who you gonna call? Try ex-SAS man Connery (stealer of every known secret of the US government and a prison break specialist so good he's been behind bars for 30 years) and not-up-to-it FBI guy Cage (chemo swot and Beatles freak). What the film does lack in novelty, it makes up for with fast-paced action, cool cars, some great set pieces and big noisy things exploding. Dumb, fun action. The DVD extras are great too.
B00004U8JV|4.0|The sequel to the immensely popular Jurassic Park (1993) is an exciting adventure starring Jeff Goldblum, Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite. The film picks up four years after the incident at Jurassic Park, where a corporate businessman Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) plans to take dinosaurs off the second island (Isla Sorna, where dinosaurs have been breeding) and bring them to a theme park in San Diego.<br />Spielberg knows what the audience wants; the film has more dinosaurs, even better CGI and impressive animatronic dinosaurs from the maestro Stan Winston. The action throughout the film is exciting and while not as astonishing as Jurassic, the effects are first-rate. John William's music for the film is suitably jungle -driven, with a dark and exhilarating score that fits the film's tone. There are problems, the tagged- on ending with the T. Rex stomping through San Diego is silly, and although the action is good, the story isn't one of Spielberg's best. That said, the principal cast are fine, especially Goldblum as Malcolm (\\"Ooh, aah, that's how it always starts, and then later the running and screaming\\") and Postewaite as Roland Tembo, a game hunter intent on shooting one of the Tyrannosaurs. Silly in parts, it's still an exciting adventure movie, with enough action and light humour to satisfy audiences.<br />The DVD extras are great, with a 50 minute `making of', deleted scenes, trailers for all 3 Jurassic movies, a huge amount of conceptual drawings, storyboards, a featurette `The world of Jurassic Park', marketing, posters and toys, production notes and web links. Great stuff.
6305181772|5.0|Brian DePalma's big-screen adaptation of the long-running T.V show is flashy, action- filled and with a plot that's extremely complicated but thankfully so, as it raises the film above standard fare. DePalma's trend for wild camera moves, excellent action and a sharp screenplay from David Koepp (Jurassic Park) and a great performance from Tom Cruise (as spy Ethan Hunt) all combine to create one wild, exciting ride, with some unexpected twists to keep the audience guessing.<br />This, in what would be DePalma's last good film of late (Snake Eyes and Mission to Mars were way below par) is an exciting adrenalin-pumping action fest with the smooth Cruiser making the coolest spy since Sean Connery in Dr NO. Also along for the ride are Jon Voight as Hunt's boss, Jean Reno and Ving Rhames as the disavowed agents and Vanessa Redgrave. Cool action, a great story, and a flashy look from the man who gave us the excellent \\"The Untouchables\\". One of the greatest action films ever made. And then some.
B00003CXDG|3.0|John Woo's glossy sequel to Brian DePalma's excellent action film sees Tom Cruise return as the super-cool spy Ethan Hunt. This time, the plot is more straightforward than the first, and in contrast, the action is more outrageous.<br />Starting out with a literal cliffhanger, the film takes off with some good action scenes and trademark coolness from the Cruiser. But events seem somewhat un-involving, lacklustre even, as the plot meanders slowly along, with some boring sub-plots and un-inspired dialogue. And Thandie Newton provides eye candy but very little else. However the Anthony Hopkins cameo is very welcome and saves the rather tedious mid section. Finally, after some extended plot twists, we see the Woo trademarks: cool action, Slo-mo gunfights and those perennial doves. Then the action roars off with the last half-hour being one huge action wallop, with an enormous amount of stunts and explosions, leaving the viewer wanting a breather. Then we are greeted with the \\"bad guy and good guy punch up\\" ending, which is exciting, if somewhat brutal. In short, been there, done that. Sold action can't cover the film's flaws. Great special features on the DVD.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Like all of my past reviews, im gonna keep this really short.  The movie was freckin awesome, great effects, great story, great acting, great everything.  I was not expecting this much out of this movie.  I just hope Star Wars Attack of the Clones will live up to this movie.
0375507507|5.0|In this African \\"Angela's Ashes\\", Fuller not only puts together a searing and unsentimental account of what amounts to a 'poor white' childhood (a useful antidote to those who think of white Africans as invariably wealthy and privileged), but also does not shirk her responsibility to deal with the realities of the historical situation in which she grew up. The uncompromising honesty of her account militates against the popular image of colonial Africa as the playground of the effete characters of \\"White Mischief\\" and \\"Out of Africa\\", and she describes her parents' struggle to survive in an increasingly hostile continent with both an unblinking realism and an understanding and affection which takes us into the heart of what it was like to be white on a black continent in the last days of the colonial era. She shows the much-commented-upon racism of her parents to have been embedded in the circumstances of the time and place, a racism perhaps more accurately understood as a type of paternalism, which has Fuller's extraordinary Mum dispensing medicines and care to all comers despite a total lack of medical training, supporting and facilitating the minimal schooling initiatives possible at the time on a poor farm in the heart of the bush, and responding to the repeated emergencies of the moment among the workers on the farms they inhabit with energy and a degree of self-sacrifice which was not uncommon at the time, but which is seldom recognised or valued in the current take on the last days of white power. Fuller is utterly successful in uncovering the depth of passionate commitment to Africa and its land and people which fuels these actions. Her parents - despite illness, nervous breakdowns, and an assortment of other disasters - stay on in Africa into old age; and each time she returns to visit them, the continent in all its corruption and poverty and extremes of need and beauty and hostility speaks to her anew - \\"the incongruous, lawless, joyful, violent, upside-down, illogical certainty of Africa comes at me like a rolling rainstorm, until I am drenched with relief.\\" Fuller writes of life, unmediated, simple, at the edge of disaster, and lets us know how possible it is to survive and become fully human in such contexts - surely reassuring, surely a cause for celebration. But then, perhaps only those who have lived through something similar will be able to fully appreciate the flavor of this extraordinary book.
B00005Y228|5.0|Let me just let you all know right now that this isn't your ordinary dance album. Kylie Minogue has a great singing voice as well, and get this: you can actually tell the difference between the songs.<br />This beautiful 36-year-old (incredible, ain't it?) Australian princess delivered an album that most people won't be able to get enough of. It doesn't matter if your stereo's fast-forward button isn't working right because you won't be needing it. Her tight production team came up with breathtaking beats and rhythms without sampling other people's. The album starts things off right with the adequately titled \\"More More More\\", because that's what you'll be yearning for after that song is over. And Kylie will give it to you in tracks like \\"Love At First Sight\\", \\"Love Affair\\" and \\"Fragile\\".<br />But it's not all about love on this album. \\"Dancefloor\\" is a you-did-me-wrong track that's still funky. It also happens to be one of the many standout tracks on here. In my opinion, the best tracks are \\"Burning Up\\", the seductive title track, and the #1 smash \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\".<br />True, people will dance to anything in the club, but any person who DOESN'T dance to any song from this album should be bounced out. Not only are there twelve great smashes to be found on Fever, there are two hidden tracks after \\"Burning Up\\" that will still keep you wanting more. If you don't have this album yet, what the hell are you waiting for?

B00005V3Z4|3.0|I'm torn on this one, and so I ultimately have to disagree with the reviewer who said there's no middle ground. That you'll either love this film or you'll hate it. I'm living proof that there is middle ground.<br />On the one hand this is a fabulously made flick. The screenwriting is sensational with some bitingly original insults, which for reasons of censorship I can't cite here, and the dialogue throughout is amazing. The characters are fantistically developed, the high schoolers take you back to your high school years and the adults show you what adulthood is all about--that we don't necessarily have things figured out any more than kids do. The audio track is flawless, sound effects fit into the puzzle just as they should, the soundtrack is fabulous (despite the fact that Donnie's little sister dances to a song (Notorius) that wasn't released until 1992). And as for the lighting. Obviously Kelly has done some Gaffer or Director of Photography work before because he has an astute sense of what angles, what shadows to employ. You could almost get the characters' emotions without actors by paying attention to how faces are lit. Or the camera angles and movements they're shot in. With that said, with one exception--Drew Barrymore, who is horribly miscast here--the acting is bitingly true. Jake Gylenhaal debuted to the limelight with October Sky very well. He follows that performance up with an even more accurate performance here. Jena Malone continues to show that she will someday soon be a massive star, despite her ripe young age of 16 and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Donnie's mother, who when she's on it, steals the screen) fit their characters flawlessly. <br />So you wonder: with all these great things said, what can possibly be wrong with this film? two things. First Drew Barrymore, who I usually love and who produced the flick, thus having the ability to pick her role, fails as a hard-nosed, but well intentioned young teacher. And secondly, and much more importantly, it never seems that Kelly has a clear vision of what he wants his debut film to be. At times it seems he wants it to be a teen, high school flick, at times a commentary on pretentiousness or gullability, at times a look into the effects of mental illness on those that suffer the malady and on the family and friends of the mentally ill, at times it feels as though it's going to be a coming of age story, at times it looks into sexual perversions, at times it a psychological analysis of different characters, at times it tries to surprise you with interesting twists and then just to convolude itself as much as humanly possibly, it's a science fiction movie about time travel. Each of these themes are fabulous film fodder, but they can't be clumped into one hour and a fifty minute movie. A combination of a few of them, sure. Or a deep investigation of one or two of them, even better. But ultimately Donnie Darko is too amibitious (something you can rarely say about films today) and can't possibly do all of the things it seems to do want to accomplish. This, on one hand, is a strength. I'd rather have a film be ambitious and scale many genres; it inspires more thought and emotion that way. But sometimes, as a writer or filmmaker, you have to narrow your scope and pick what's most important. It feels as though Kelly never did that. And if he did, I'd loathe seeing the original first couple drafts of this script.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Princess Mononoke was one of the first anime I've seen, and is still one of the best! The plot is original, interesting, and does not follow the &quot;fantasy formula.&quot; The voices (Billy Crudup, Claire Daines, Billy Bob Thorton, etc) fit the characters perfectly, unlike several animes I have seen (Serena in Sailor Moon...). The music in Princess Mononoke, composed by Joe Hisaishi, is astouding; I also recommend the soundtrack. The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I thought the ending was rather rushed and could have been better. Overall, Princess Mononoke is definitley an anime worth watching.

I'd like to gab a good long while about it, but I'm gonna watch it again(I just finished watching it once tonight!) It's perfect! PERFECT!...
B00005J9M0|5.0|&quot;Introspective&quot; is a one-of-a-kind release from Pet Shop Boys.  Is it an EP?  A remix album?  Or is it a new studio recording?  It is all these things and more. The album contains remixes of previously released material, newly recorded songs, and a couple covers to boot.  Although &quot;Introspective&quot; is a grab-bag of an album, it's by no means a throwaway record.  &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot; is a stomping disco number, replete with a full orchestra and Neil Tennant's spoken vocals.  &quot;I Want a Dog&quot; is a funked-up remix of the original b-side, while we're treated to a housed version of their No. 1 &quot;Always On My Mind.&quot;  In addition, there's &quot;I'm Not Scared,&quot; which Patsy Kensit would later record, and they do a decent cover of Sterling Void's &quot;It's Alright.&quot;  Though the record is only 6 tracks long, &quot;Introspective&quot; is a triumph of quality over quantity, and at the time, it was the most disco-centric release of their catalogue.  If &quot;Very&quot; or &quot;Behaviour&quot; is the duo's best album, then &quot;Introspective&quot; ranks a close second.<br />More interesting, still, is the second disc, which has rare remixes, demo versions, and songs they originally recorded for Dusty Springfield and Liza Minnelli.  The song of note is &quot;I Get Excited (You Get Excited Too)&quot; which was a b-side to the single &quot;Heart&quot; but is strong enough to be released as a single.
0525946284|5.0|Picture this: The time was Hours before D-day, World War 2. The place: German-occupied France. Six agents parachuted behind enemy lines to sabotage a communications facility that serves as a link between France and Germany. Tell you what I think it was: Dirty half-dozen, except that instead of those ragged boys in the movie (and in the book), women did the dirty job of getting the Germans with their pants down. The characters were awesomely depicted, especially Flick Clairet; the antagonist, Dieter Franck was extremely annoying that you would actually think of Jason Isaacs' role in The Patriot (I really hate that character). Anyway, it's a good read, much of it is page-turning, and if you're not doing anything can finish it in a single day.
B000000OSG|5.0|THIS SECTION APPLIES TO BOTH ALBUMS:<br />Apparently, Axl is a perfectionist when it comes to producing albums, the result is that you can listen to all his songs over and aver again. It is as if one month you'll enjoy a whole bunch of these songs, then you'll grow and like some more - then you'll go back to liking some other ones - then finally you'll appreciate them all. In addition, unlike seemingly all the other albums produced these days, the songs aren't all concerned with the central theme of love. There are songs on here to suit every mood. The common theme is probably relationship-breakups and accountability-retribution. If you can identify with the songs, they will be even more special.<br />USE YOUR ILLUSION II:<br />My favourite song of the lot is \\"ESTRANGED\\". It has some extraordinary guitar solos by Slash, with a rather haunting quality, which are simply captivating. Half way through, the song just totally changes, and the way it transpires is exquisite. It is really two songs in its own right, but because they are together and combined into one song, the whole song is greater than the sum of its parts (i.e. synergistic). The video clip of this song is also one of their best ever. Truly an inspiring song.<br /> \\"LOCOMOTIVE\\" (or \\"COMPLICITY\\" as it is otherwise known) is probably one of the most changeable of all the songs on here because it just has so many different tunes, while the ending is especially distinctive. \\"BREAKDOWN\\" is similar in that the style is also very variable. \\"PRETTY TIED UP\\" is worth mentioning, because it is often overlooked. They even blend in a piano!<br />I think most of you will already be familiar with classic GNR numbers such as the politically inclined \\"CIVIL WAR\\" and the enraged \\"YOU COULD BE MINE\\" - these are great songs. Others have said that the alternate-lyrics version of \\"DON'T CRY\\" is superfluous, but I feel it surpasses the original. The only track I haven't come to like is \\"MY WORLD\\" but that's only a 82 seconds long anyway. Even the relatively weak tracks \\"GET IN THE RING\\" and \\"SHOTGUN BLUES\\" have their vengeful moments.<br />It just doesn't get any better than this. I only hope the new GNR band is as good as when the old GNR accomplished these \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums! Did I review them well? Don't forget to read my other UYI review. Thanks for reading. But seriously, how on Earth could you consider getting one and not the other!?ong anyway.

6304415346|5.0|What a great movie.  Finally a Trek movie that has a worth while enemy: the borg, and this time their back, and they are VICIOUS!  Although I prefer the Federation (ships especially) over the Borg, the Borg are one of the races that I see fit to actually cause damage to the Federation (the Romulans and species 8472 being the other 2 good enemy races).  One part of the movie (the assualt against the Borg cube) is one of the best, most famous space battles.  Unfortunatly, it's fairly short, once the Enterprise E comes in and kicks some BOOTY (yeah!).  Then the Enterprise is sent back through time to the time of, you guessed it, first contact.  The rest of the action in this movie relys mostly on in-ship combat, as well as an outstanding outer hull battle where Picard, Worf, and Lt. Hawk engage the Borg on the deflector array on the outer hull of the ship.  That was a big highlight!  Anyway, the movie has the great start, the great ending, and leaves you hanging, ready for the next Trek movie.  Get this, now.
B000000WF0|5.0|This is a exceptional album, however, there are five songs on it that I don&iexcl;¯t listen to, so be aware that they&iexcl;¯re not all good. Despite this, I think Urban Hymns is exceptionally innovative and one of the best albums of the late 90&iexcl;¯s.<br />I suppose &iexcl;°Bitter Sweet Symphony&iexcl;± is the most well¨Cknown of all. It is not necessarily my favourite, but it does make use of an Orchestra, which makes it unique. The start of &iexcl;°Lucky Man&iexcl;± just has to be heard; for me it invokes a kind of dreamy street scene.<br />Another track that is probably my favourite is &iexcl;°Velvet Morning&iexcl;± ¨C you can tell Ashcroft has such control of his vocal chords in this one; the song starts off with a slow pace that builds up each chorus, and each time afterwards it goes quiet again. &iexcl;°The Sonnet&iexcl;±, &iexcl;°One Day&iexcl;± and &iexcl;°The Drugs Don&iexcl;¯t Work&iexcl;± are also listenable.<br />I&iexcl;¯m listening to this album as I review it. Overall, the lyrics are quite &iexcl;°deep&iexcl;± and the vocals are very emotive. A few songs, such as &iexcl;°Weeping Willow&iexcl;± and &iexcl;°Space and Time&iexcl;± have sections where there are several people singing different things concurrently, and the effect is quite surreal ¨C I like those parts too. I don&iexcl;¯t know what it is exactly, but I think this album is comparable to &iexcl;°Odyssey Number Five&iexcl;± by Powderfinger. One thing I do like about both of these two albums is that they are not all love songs.<br />On all the songs mentioned here, the guitar work complements the main vocals very nicely indeed, with just the right blend of authority and reverberation/resonance, while the drums aren&iexcl;¯t overly loud or dominating either. The whole band has the ability to harmonize extremely well. Like all good music, it is very hard to describe in words ¨C I just can&iexcl;¯t do it justice. The Verve has obviously put a great deal of work into this album and it shows.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|At first I wanted to see this movie, because of all the commotion I heard of \\"Moulin Rouge\\". Well, at the beginning of the movie it's kind of boring. At the middle is very good composed. <BR>   The movie is basically of an actress (Nicole Kidman) who wants to become more famous. So, she wants to impress the Duke. In a play she meets Christian (Ewan) who she thinks he is the Duke. So she falls in love with him. But, the Duke doesn't accept that. The Duke wants her to be for him. In a performance, (actress Nicole Kidman) falls because she has a fatal disease. Only she doesn't know that is fatal until later on in the movie. The Duke is planning to kill Christian so (actress Nicole Kidman) can forget him. But, (Nicole Kidman) lies to Christina that she doesn't love him no more. She does that so Christian can forget her and leave so he won't die. At the end, (actress Nicole's) last performance Christian knows that (actress Nicole) loves him and lied about that she didn't. The Duke doesn't accept that and tries and kill Christian when the play is going, but fells. At the end of the play (Actress Nicole) dies, and Christian cries beside her.<BR>So this movie was very good composed. It made my parents cry. So I guess the LOVE in the movie was so real. I highly recommend people to see this movie. It's not boring, because it's a musical. It is very GOOD!
0671027344|5.0|Wow, this book absolutely amazed me. I don't read many books, but me and my sister happened to come across this one, something I'll always be thankful for. No book has ever touched me like this one did. I can't begin to express how much I loved it. Things that Charlie spoke of made me burst out laughing sometimes, other times I was just in total awe of the depth, still others I was amzed at how much he was taking words right out of my mouth, and by the end I could not even continue to read(I was crying too much!). If I would EVER recommned a book to anyone, it's The Perks of Being a Walflower.
0671027344|5.0|This novel helps readers to look at life from a different angle, and also takes you back in time, to when you were younger.  It is an interesting journey through Charlie's world which has many experiences that we can all relate to.  This novel was given to me as a gift and oddly enough the story had parts about love relating to events in my life identical to the book.  If I could say one thing about this novel it would be that once you start reading it, you won't be able to set it down until you are through.
6304493681|5.0|For most people I know, there are three anime films that are typical firsts: Akira, Ninja Scroll and Ghost in the Shell.  Ghost in the Shell was my introduction to the world of Anime.  <br />The Good:<br />GitS is a very thought provoking story centered on the importance of humanity. The story line really makes you think, so much so that it may take a couple watchings before you \\"get it.\\"  <br />The animation is nothing short of fantastic.  The music really sets a mood that, while not heart pounding by any means, does seem to get you exactly where the director wants you. It is a very well thought out story, and the care taken in making the animation and music fit that story is very evident.  <br />Last note, this is a gate-way-drug for many anime fans for a reason. It's that good.<br />The Bad<BR>It is short, a mere 82 minutes. It's one of the shortest \\"feature-length films\\" I've personally seen in a while.  <br />The English dub is also lacking miserably.  In many places its half hearted and hokey.  Definitely go for the Japanese track with sub-titles. <br />This seems like it tries to be an action flick, but the battle scenes are few and far between. The music, while setting the mood the director seems to have wanted to set, just doesn't seem appropriate if you want the audiences heart pumping adrenaline.<br />Last word, expect a quick viewing, bypass the English dub and don't get too hyped up about being on the edge of your seat.<br />The Ugly<BR>The Major after going several rounds with a tank.
B000002UWE|5.0|Talk Talk as a band, had no characteristic that would suggest<BR>a very bright future. In fact they wouldn't have a chance<BR>to make it in the current music scene. Thank God for the 80's!<BR>Mark 'Ugly Duckling' Hollis, subconsciously led by his<BR>love for impressionists like Bartok and Debussy, created mostly<BR>profound music, occasionally mixed with incomprehensible lyrics.<BR>Two of their flops in England (It's My Life, #46 and Such A<BR>Shame, # 49 in 1984) are considered to be among the all time <br />classic pop songs in radio stations all over my country. <BR>Their absolute masterpiece as far as I'm concerned was their third Album, The Colour Of Spring in 1986, produced by Tim<BR>Friese-Greene. Tim had been producing hit records for quite <BR>some time (The Lion Sleeps Tonight - TIGHT FEET / #1 in 1982, Cry Boy Cry - BLUE ZOO / #13 in 1982 and She Blinded Me With Science - THOMAS DOLBY / US #5 in 1983). Life's What You Make <BR>It, the first single coming from this LP, was accompanied<BR>by an exceptional ecological video-clip, which I forthright recommend. Happiness Is Easy is brilliant pop, a contemporary prayer filled with children's chorus. Not to mention <BR>that Mark has two of the cutest ears in pop music. I love this<BR>guy!
B000001Y2U|4.0|...This is not some prophetic piece of art that will change life as we know it...this album is very good, but nothing great.  Trent Reznor's talent can only take a moderately talented band so far.  If you disagree that they're only moderately talented, then you need not look any farther than their earlier albums, which are about as forgettable as Kenny G.  The songs are interesting, but the lacking musicianship gets in the way, as they are forced to resort to sub-par riffs over and over again.  Secondly, the lyrics, while occassionally quite well-written, often amount to little more than petulant whining.  I understand why this appeals to teens, who are also quite adept at petulant whining, but it gets old pretty quickly.<br />Nevertheless, it's worth buying....
0141304642|2.0|I got this book in a boxed set of Roald Dahl's books. While I loved Matilda and *liked* The Witches, I found this book almost, well, comepletely stupid. Mr. Hoppy has loved his neigbor Ms. Silver for a very long time, but has never summond up the courage to tell her his feelings. One day while they were having a chat, Ms. Silver mentions that she worries about her much loved tortises size. So Mr.Silver comes up with a ridiculous plan to make it look the it had grown, then before you know it, they're married. I read this book in about twenty minutes, and i can never see how this can be depictied as a novel. The story was absolutely just plain stupid! This was written for younger audiences, I kept that in mind, but I dont think it's the kind of story children would like, there's no point to it! NOT reccomended.
B00005JKCF|5.0|First off, I have never read a Spider-man comic in my life, in fact, I never was into comics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It delivers everything you would expect from any big-budget summer blockbuster. You get action, you get dazzling special effects and even a love story to boot. Sure, the movie is predictable, but that's what makes it so great. Sure, I like a lot of cynical films and most of my favorite movies don't have happy endings, but it's refreshing to see a movie that actually feels good to watch. Tobey Maguire is perfect in his roll as Peter Parker, a photography geek who is turned into Spider-man by way of a poisonous spider-bite. His love interest and next door neighbor is played by Kirsten Dunst. Both are perfect for the movie and do a really good job. Willem Dafoe was a great choice for Norman Osbourne (AKA The Green Goblin) to me, his character had the most dimension. Even though he was the bad guy, I didn't know how to feel towards him in the movie. At times he would be a caring father and five minutes later he would be an insane terrorist. The plot is very good, I don't know if it actually comes from the comic book, but I thought it was VERY well written and has plenty of plot twists to keep you awake. My only gripe about this film is the scene inside of the burning building where Spider-Man and the Green Goblin get into a fight [...]. If I had been behind the editing chair, that scene would have hit the cutting room floor [...]. But one tiny problem can't defeat an otherwise great movie. I suggest anyone goes to see it. I'm not a comic-book freak and I loved it, and I plan on going to see it again while it's still in theaters.
6305537798|5.0|I am in love with what some people like to call teeny-bopper movies.  They are all I ever watch.  I just saw this movie for the first time few months ago, and I fell in love with it.  I love Shakespeare's works and the humor in this movie added to the story line makes it amazing.  Julia Stiles is by far my favorite actress and I think she is wonderful as Kat.  Heath Ledger is also a great actor (and really cute!)  If you haven't seen this movie, go see it today!
B00005JKCF|5.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" is the second of three projected movies based on comic book characters from Marvel. This film is easily one of the best action movies that I've ever watched. The acting was phenomonal, the stunts great, the action superb, and the plot was outstanding. The plot of this film basically sets up Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man's life. It shows how he is not popular and is a geek in school and doesn't really fit in with the \\"in\\" crowd. It shows how he got bitten by the super spider and how his whole entire life was transformed from a high school kid into a crime fighting superhero. The main conflict in this film is between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. <br /> This film is so monumental and had such a huge success at the box office because of the character of Spider-Man. Spider-Man has been around for about 40 years and this is the first live action screenplay featuring the loved superhero. Moviegoers and comic book readers can identify with Peter Parker because he is just an ordinary guy until he is bit by a spider. It is very easy to spot Peter's weaknesses and stengths and to compare them towards your own. Sam Raimi, the director of this film, succeeded so well in the production because he accurately portrayed Spider-Man, and all of the other characters for that matter, so well. Credit should also be given to the talented actors and actresses that starred in this movie. Those are the reasons for the huge success of this film.<br /> The portrayals of each character was done brilliantly because of great actors. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker and suits the role that he is playing very well. Kirsten Dunst made a name for herself in this film as she played Mary Jane Watson, Spider-Man's crush. Dunst, Maguire, and all of the other actors in this film deserve much credit as the film would have been no where as good as it is if these people weren't in it. <br /> The action sequences were done marvelously and these scenes helped make the movie what itis. The costume and makeup team did a fabulous job and they did a great job of bringing Spider-Man and everybody elses' costumes alive. Finally, the drama was great and in every scene you will be able to feel for the characters. What made this film so great was that it was very realistic and it seems like the events in this film actually happened.<br /> \\"Spider-Man\\" is definitely the best film that I've seen all year and this now holds a place in the top ten of my favorite films. This film will not only be enjoyed by comic book readers but by kids and adults that have never read a Spidey comic before. This is defintiely worth seeing many, many times. Now I'm in agony waiting for the DVD.<br />Happy Viewing!
014028009X|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I have ever read.  Bridget Jones is very easy to relate to and Helen Fielding describes her and all of her characters very well.  While reading during class I laughed out loud so many times that my teacher made me stand up and tell everyone what I was reading, which was really embarassing!  A lot of people are now reading this because of that, so at least my embarrasment wasn't in vain.  I'm sure that other reviewers have described the plot so I won't waste your time any longer.  I'll just say one more thing: Read this book, you won't regret it!
B00005QW4K|5.0|Great movie! Bruce Campbell does a great job returning as Ash in the third movie of Evil Dead. Evil Dead was great, #2 was good too, and Army of Darkness was outstanding! I suggest you get the non-bootleg edition though. I like the S-Mart \\"Hail to the King, Baby\\" ending better than the \\"end of the world\\" theme.The extra footage is kind-a boring (I can see why they cut it out), but it still rocks. If you like great BC quotes, don't buy this. The regular version has better ones (\\"Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.\\"). Anyway, the movie is funny as hell if you like semi-slapsick moments.
6305076995|4.0|I first saw this concert footage movie back in 1979, at a midnight movie.  Although I had always enjoyed Yes, this movie moved them to a new status for me.  The songs performed include selections from The Yes Album, Close to the Edge, and Fragile, which I feel was their freshest and most inventive period.  Although the sound quality is not what we are used to hearing on a DVD (this sounds like analog quality), and the picture is somewhat grainy, it is a pure reflection of the band in the early 70's, and to my knowledge the only performance recorded on video during the early years. This is something every appreciator of the band should own.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' fragile-sounding voice, combined with the spare piano, guitar and bass arrangements, make the best tracks on this CD really shine. Her rendition of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; will remind you more of Billie Holiday than Hank Williams. The opening track, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is especially haunting. The problem with this album is that it is uneven. Some of the songs are just not very arresting, despite the appeal of Norah Jones'stunning voice. Still, it's enjoyable listening and I recommend it.
B000000LZV|5.0|&quot;our band could be your life&quot; are the lyrics that are sung/spoken by d. boon at the opening of &quot;history lesson part II&quot; and honestly, no truer words have been spoken than that. at the time, i never realized what an incredible impact this band and this record in particular would have on my life.  with this record, mike watt taught me how to play bass.  the minutemen taught me the meaning of &quot;jam econo&quot;.  <BR> some of the greatest albums ever recorded when you look back at them only reflect where you were at that particular time in your life.  they make you think about old friends and girlfriends, old jobs and experiences...etc.  &quot;double nickels on the dime&quot; however brings me back to where i learned about the importance of friendship in music and being brave enough to do your own thing both musically and with your own lifestyle in general.  things that aren't just moments in time, but lessons learned that if you are lucky will stick with you for the rest of your life.  <BR> when i am on my way to gigs now with my own band and i start to feel the gitters of insecurity creeping in on me this is the cd i reach for.  i pop it in and it elevates me above it all.  the minutemen were the ultimate do it yourself band that paved the way for others with ideas and hopes of doing something different and they elevate me like that every time.  if you give them a chance, they'll do it for you too.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I heard &quot;Rose Bouge&quot; via video on a transatlantic flight and had to have it. I purchased it on my first day at home and have played it repeatedly. The drums and circa 50-60's type jazz sold me on this CD. I plan to buy more from St. Germain.
B000002BUY|5.0|I bought this CD about a year ago now, not really knowing much about Incubus.  Ever since I bought this, they have become my favourite band! This CD has fat attitude - It is by far my most favourite CD in my collection! The album starts off with &quot;Redefine&quot;, which is pure genius.  From my point of view, the best tracks on the album are &quot;New Skin&quot;, &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot;, &quot;Vitamin&quot;, and ofcourse &quot;Redefine&quot;.  &quot;Summer Romance&quot; is a soothing track which is also a great song! Brandon Boyd's voice is one of the best around these days. You won't find much better!  New Incubus fans and hardcorists alike, I'm sure you will all appreciate this CD.
0440213525|4.0|Despite of the critics, I think that John Grisham's \\"The Client\\" is one of his most thrilling novels.<br />Mark Sway was an 11 yr. old mischievous kid who learned the biggest secret of a Mafia murderer...But, he was so scared enough to tell the FBI & the police because his family was threatened by the Mob if he would tell the location of the late Senator Boyette...The prosecuters & the FBI were doing all they could do to let Mark tell them...He decided to get an inexperienced female lawyer named Reggie Love who would do anything to save his client and her life. <br />My favorite character had to be Reggie Love because of her tough character towards Mrs. Sway's employee, the police & FBI..Ironically, she was a real sweetie to her clients...The characters were all gerat. I could clearly imagine their colorful positive or negative attitudes.<br />To those who are starting to read John Grisham's novels, I suggest you buy this one...This is my first Grisham novel and I absolutely planned to buy more of his works.
B000062XFG|5.0|come on guys aren't you trekkies? I guess not, all these episodes are awesome, I mean yeah you might have a couple of poorly written episodes in there, but they are still worth watching over and over again! I mean this all comes from some of the greatest minds!...
B000005IU1|5.0|Let's not beat around the bush here - this is one great album. It's influence is endless and it still sounds as fresh today as I'm sure it would have over thirty years ago. Songs like \\"1969\\" (later covered by The Damned) and \\"No Fun\\" (later covered by the Sex Pistols) are boundless in their youthful energy and exuberance, while \\"I Wanna be your Dog\\" has a guitar riff that still reverberates in a way that few from this period do. It also has the hallmarks of a classic Velvet Underground rocker (this album being produced by John Cale). The insistent piano chord throughout \\"I Wanna be your Dog\\" is a particular VU trademark. For me, though, the only low point is the slow drag of \\"We Will Fall\\", which seems distinctly out of place amongst the other predominantly three-chord classics. Having said this, you may need a little respite from the constant punishment to your ears of all these pounding power-chords. And its influence? Does anyone remember Punk...? A true undergound classic
B00003CWTI|1.0|What the hell was that movie about?  <BR>What was the story?  Why do I care about any of the characters?  The only guy I liked was Tom Cruis<BR>I'm still trying to figure out what the story was, not what it was about (which is nothing), but what it was.  Why should I expend all my energy to figure this out?  <br />No disrespect to those who really liked this movie, but are you sure you're not just trying to be weird?
B000002JR8|5.0|... Phil goes crazy with<BR>his vocals, he sounds like he's choking on broken glass. Dimebag<BR>provides the guitar that we've all come to know and love, Rex compliments him quite nicely on bass, and Vinnie Paul comes through with his manic drumming. Pantera has NEVER sold out, never cared about record sales or trends like so many other bands<BR>out there today. Fast and furious, this cd is just plain angry. ...  anywayz, the cd that made me truly appreciate heavy music. if you don't already own it, BUY IT!!!
B000002U9W|5.0|Although Pink Floyd is my favorite band, some of their albums can get a little tedious to listen to because of a sharp contrast between songs the whole band wanted to play and songs their label (or Roger Waters on their later albums) wanted them to record. What I really like about Atom Heart Mother is that there is absolutely NO FILLER on this CD. Each song is nothing short of incredible.<br />&quot;The Atom Heart Mother Suite:&quot; Nothing short of amazing, blending epic guitar and keyboard solos with eerie choir passages and blaring french horn melodies. Sounds a lot like Godspeed You Black Emperor.<br />&quot;If:&quot; A worthy sequel to &quot;Set the Controls&quot; and &quot;Cymbaline,&quot;  Roger Waters' best early songs. It sets the stage for other slow-paced Waters songs, such as &quot;Brain Damage,&quot; &quot;Pigs on the Wing,&quot; and &quot;Mother,&quot; originating the stum/solo/strum pattern that worked on those classic songs.<br /> &quot;Summer '68:&quot; Tied with &quot;Remember a Day&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; as Rick Wright's finest Floydian moment, sounding &quot;emoish&quot; long before emo was concieved of. The horn interlude is truly spectacular.<br /> &quot;Fat Old Sun:&quot; Much better live, but still a great song. Gilmour manages to capture the mellow atmosphere that &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; attempted to produce, but failed at. <br />&quot;Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast:&quot; An awesome jam song combined with the sound of a Floyd roadie making breakfast and talking about &quot;macrobiotics in Los Angeles.&quot; It creates a great hypnotic mood that can cure the worst of insomnia. <br />To sum it up, the whole album is great, and the Floyd put a lot of effort into making the whole thing sound good, not just two or three songs. If you like Pink Floyd at all, I beseech you to buy this. You know not what you're missing. Plus, there's a cow on the cover. How cool is that?
0783226063|4.0|As a kid and early teen this was my favorite film.  It took easily five viewings for it to actually make sense, and years later things were still starting to click.  I eventually read the Dune Storybook I got at a garage sale, which is an adaptation of Lynch's original storyboard and script.  That explained much more for me.  When I finally read the book I realized just how bad an adaptation the film was.  The 3 hour version that occasionally airs is even worse: incomplete special effects, horrible prologue, bad editing, and acting scenes that belonged on the cutting room floor.  Indeed, most of the footage in that version was actually taken years later from the unwanted cutting room floor pieces that were still locked up somewhere.  It's ironic that they kept those pieces considering the following:<br />The editor's rough cut was originally 8 hours.  Lynch's completed cut that De Laurentis viewed was about 5 hours, with a planned intermission.  You can imagine what this producer's reaction was, and so he immediately attempted to convince Lynch to shorten it.  Unfortunately, at this time in Lynch's career, money talked.  In his own words: \\"I sold out.\\" (from an interview with Charlie Rose) He gave up his right to the final theatrical cut, which ended up grossly over-editing the film.  It still retains the warmth of Lynch's version, but removed far too many of the key scenes from the book, including the garden scene and those surrounding the Fremen bulb agriculture (you see them in the background of the Atomics scene), resulting in a cryptic, rushed quality that now can only be justified by saying it's more \\"mysterious\\".  Like the original cut of Blue Velvet, done right after this one, the original completed cut of Lynch's Dune was apparently lost or destroyed by the studio.  What a tragedy.<br />Even if Lynch had held onto final cut, the film still would not have been a reasonably faithful adaptation.  Lynch was not some longtime Dune fanatic, as has been falsely reported, and hadn't even read the book when someone gave him a copy and suggested he get involved with the project.  He spotted in the book something very special, but Lynch was certainly not a purist qualified to tackle it in the first place.  In the film there's no mention of the fact that the date is well past the 200th century AD and 10191 is actually \\"after the guild\\", AG.  We are WAY into the future in the Dune novels, about twice as far as Lynch insinuates. The human race was nearly exterminated by the human computers & machines millennia before, which is why everything in the Dune universe since is either operated by simple clock-based computers or human beings - hence the necessity for mind altering drugs, mutation, and man-machine interfaces.  AI's are not allowed anymore, so humans had to become capable of taking their place, which was not without unintended side-effects.  There is a Grand Unified Theory, so the only final frontier left is that of the human mind.  Get it?<br />In Lynch's Dune, the weirding modules, while cool in their own right, totally deprive us of the original \\"Crusades of the Future\\" that Herbert was going for in his novel.  The very reason for Herbert to come up with the body shields was to make projectile weapons mostly obsolete, thus necessitating hand-to-hand edged weapon combat.  It's a brilliant idea, but one that has yet to make it into any adaptation except in the most limited sense.  Add to that Harkonen heart plugs and red hair, and while it all works in its own, it really belongs in a different film, not Dune.  The new Sci-Fi channel version was interesting, but marred by poor production quality, bad CGI, idiotic costume choices, uninspiring screen direction, and too much borrowing from Lynch (more red hair).  Whose idea was it to give everyone hats, anyway?  What's so baffling to me is how any version would even need to change so many details.  Herbert practically gives you everything, explaining, in detail, the surroundings, lighting, clothing, positions of the characters, etc, in EVERY SINGLE SCENE IN THE BOOK.  From there all you'd need to do is pick the most important scenes to recreate while trying to preserve most of the plotlines and themes.  Even Lynch's script, which he apparently filmed in its entirety, is still missing some of the most important themes from the entire book.<br />And to add further insult to injury, there are scenes in the novel that are so cinematic that it should be obvious to include them: the burning palm trees scene, the blooming of the desert, the Baron watching the final battle with the static-electricity halos of colliding body shields and sabers in the distance.  There are gorgeous, visual scenes in the novel that would undoubtedly translate well to film, yet two directors have so far ignored them.  It's simply baffling.  All of this said, you'd perhaps need as much length and twice the budget of, say, HBO's From the Earth to the Moon series to actually pull it off perfectly.  In its own right, Lynch's Dune is a head-trip, and if you're patient enough it will pay off with stylized visuals and wonderful directing of the actors.  And maybe those Forbidden Planet-inspired effects and costumes are sort of endearing, too.  But the novel is just worlds better (pun intended).<br />SIDE NOTE: While newly remastered, anamorphic versions of the theatrical cut of Dune exist on DVD overseas, the US version is painfully lacking in compatibility for Widescreen TV's.  IT IS NOT IN ANAMORPHIC.  I know of no plans to change this any time soon.  It kind of figures, doesn't it?gs, lighting, clothing, positions of the characters, etc, in EVERY SINGLE SCENE IN THE BOOK.

B00003CXXP|1.0|This is a film driven more by characters and character motivation than by plot. However, it really fails to explore or develop these characters in any significant depth. Ultimately, the film's downfall is that it contradicts itself repeatedly, which destroys all continuity rendering it impotent of any legitimacy. Ultimately the denouement is an insult to all of us. John William's innovative and thought provoking score is of little consequence. The DVD extras add nothing.
0451527712|5.0|According to Hollywood, Frankenstein is a mean, gory character who kills randomly out of pleasure.  Although this may be exciting, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein  is by no means anything like this.  Instead, Mary Shelly's novel depicts a more human and compassionate side of the Being.  I loved this book so much.  It introduced so many new ideas that make you think, such as the idea on how far you can actually take science and technology without interfering with life and death.  I liked how she described the being as a human instead of a monster, but also left out some description so you can picture him in your own way.  My favorite scene in the book is the turning point, when the Being is rejected by his neighbors.  This shows why he started to kill and have no feelings for human nature.  Mary Shelly's style of writing is interesting.  Although it's a bit slow at times, the novel was for the most part, exciting.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Romantic writing and also has a great imagination.
0385335482|3.0|I resisted reading this book for a long time simply because I thought it would be silly and not very interesting. But so many people raved about it that I decided to give it a try. I love the Brit Lit genre, and assumed this would fall into that category. As it sort of does.<br />Becky was not as likeable a character as, say Bridget Jones, or Jemima J. She is self absorbed, flighty and manic! But yet she is addictive, and so are her plights and emotional rollercoasters about her shopping addiction and the financial implications. I am not a shopaholic, and yet I found myself relating on some level to her cyclical buying, spending and then lamenting over how much she spent. And then of course hiding the bills -- out of sight out of mind!<br />This book is pretty shallow, but it is loads of fun. I read it in conjunction with another book so that if I didn't feel like heavy reading I could pick this one up. And by the end I have to admit I was cheering for Becky and happy that she landed herself where she did (without giving anything away). <br />This book is not as fulfilling or plot focused as other brit lit, but it is equally as fun and as addictive. If I were to choose, I would go with any Marian Keyes, Jane Green or Lisa Jewell book over this. But this one IS a lot of fun. And a good way to brush up on brand names and fashion trends! It made me want to go shopping!
0446677450|3.0|If your looking for a story to give you the &quot;get rich&quot; perspective, this is your book. It sets the mental can-do platform and a little something extra to get you on your way. If your looking for sturdy financial wrungs for your ladder, this book suggests ways but falls short of details. For those details, you must buy . . . next book, see the lecture, and so forth. <BR>Look at the number of pages: 184. You won't find the road map<BR>to success, here. You might find a nudge. For a good laugh and<BR>an interesting sci-fi adventure try &quot;Damsel in the Rough&quot; by Tempesta. There are nudges there too.
B00005QG9J|1.0|I must write this to warn metal heads. This band [is bad] if you are into metal. This band has about as much metal as nickleback and linkin park. Do not buy this CD if you think they are heavty metal, they're another MTV band... They are not as bad as Linkin Park, nickle back, or limp bizkit but they are defintely not metal. The only chance I might buy this cd is for my mother.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I just saw Pitch Black for the first time and I didn't expect much but I must say that I really liked it. Critics called it a disappointing second film from the director of the Arrival but even though I liked Arrival I think this is a big step above that. Vin Diesel gives the biggest break through performance of the year next to Hugh Jackman's in X-Men. Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser also give fine performances. Besides having a good cast this movie is also full of a lot of nail biting suspense. It doesn't only come from the aliens that attack when it's dark but from Vin Diesel's character as well because you never know if you can trust him even if he is the hero. Diesel's so good at Riddick that I wouldn't mind seeing him reprise the role sometime. This is a lot better than the other Sci-Fi's of this year like Super Nova and Mission to Mars so check it out
B00000K0DK|5.0|Still the ultimate American saga, Welles' retelling of the Hearst legend gets better with age.  The recreation of newsreel footage in the \\"News on the March\\" segment, the telling of the story from unique perspectives (Thatcher, Bernstein, Leland and Susan), and just watching the slow corruption of Kane's soul are some of many highlights. Definitely a don't miss. Ranked #1 on my all-time favorite movie list.
B00003W8NM|4.0|...Fight Club is violent, sure, and its characters gleefully anarchistic but at the heart of it all is a struggling (in)sane person trying to reclaim his life.<BR>Gleefully funny, yes, and as with all of Fincher's movies, beautifully shot, Fight Club is great. Norton and Pitt are two of their generations greatest actors and Helena Bonham Carter is also quite good. <BR>The DVD is very nicely done, through and through. You can see from the packaging that Fox really put an effort into making this a package worth owning. With numerous videos showcasing the making of the movie and photo galleries and lots more, the extras are very very good. <BR>In short, a great movie and a great DVD,  highly recommended.<...
6302799066|5.0|My favorite of all of Kubrick's movies and that is saying something. It works as a comedy, as an anti-war film and as a testament of cold war mentality. It also boasts career best comedic performances by Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott and Peter Sellers in what should have been an Oscar winning performance (or performances). Ranked #2 on my all-time favorite movie list
B00005JKL8|2.0|If you want mindless action and your're not discerning, then this may be the film for you. Personally, I found it to be a big disappointment. The characters (including Hackman's) were shallow and the film was replete with technical inaccuracies. The only character worth cheering for was the 'bad' guy!<br />Sorry. This is a classic 'B' movie.
078401213X|4.0|I rated this film high even though it rubbed pretty hard against one of my pet peeves.<br />I really enjoyed this film and I'm not sure if that speaks to the genius of the writers/directors/actors or just that I am so incredibly sick to death of the [stuff] Hollywood cranks out with alarming regularity.  It is so nice to put a film in that challenges you to think a little.  I REALLY could have done witbout the soundtrack which very often trampled over the dialog so badly that I had to rewind and listen to a scene 3x before I caught all the words.<br />Having said that, I am still left wondering how much of this movie was actually a paranoid delusion and how much actually happened.  I think they wanted it that way.  i think making the computer look like something out of a Dr. Seuss book and the crazy rabbis chasing him were intended to make you wonder, \\"hey wait, did any of this really happen to him?\\"<br />The closing scene is also one of those movie moments that gets burned into your consciousness.  Kinda like the cop mutilation scene in Reservoir Dogs.<br />Don't miss Pi if you like the offbeat.  If you think Die Hard II rocked, for example, then you may want to look elsewhere =-)
