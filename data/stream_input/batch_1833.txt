B007SGLZP8|5.0|have read all of John Grisham's books and is one of my favorite authors!!!  I can't get enough of him.
1451627297|1.0|This book should have been edited in half.  King spends hundreds of pages on digressions that go nowhere.  We learn that he regrets not spending more time as a HS teacher so lives that \\"dream\\" through this book, forcing us to ride along.  And when he appears to finaly get tired of writing about it he \\"wraps it up\\" with a few pages of nonsense.  A gigantic waste of time.  Do not waste yours!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would recommend these books to everyone.  very enjoyable reading.  I also like to read Susan Collins books and will read more of her books.
0307956350|4.0|An easy and fun read.  Nothing to deep or serious, just light escapism.  It's not exactly the type of book that will inspire you to travel, but maybe a little.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|The first book is readable and even quite enjoyable, but the language (She was a women \\"flowered\\") repeated over and over gets a bit hard to take. In later books of the series you really have to been keen to keep reading as they become harder and harder to stay interested in each story line.
141659521X|5.0|Another in the series of Vince Flynn books that seem to tell the reader he has an inside source at the CIA.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This movie is one of my family favorites. It has both blue ray and regular set which was pretty amazing
B0091REZMW|4.0|enjoy finding objects. entertainment for all if you have good eyes. playing this game on the computer is much easier because of the screen size, but over all it is a fun and challenging game.
0385535147|5.0|This is, without a doubt, his most convoluted story ever.  Make sure you have plenty of time to spend before you start reading because you'll have a hard time putting this gripping book down.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We do wish Thomas and O'Brien would become better characters and not such trouble makers.  I am sure in the end they will mellow.
B008CP92ZO|3.0|There were very funny parts but overall kind of boring.  Would not purchase.  Jennifer was great of course and Paul Rudd was hilarious.

B0098VXN2Y|4.0|If you are trying to persuade your spouse into having children, this is not the movie to have them watch!  It was so hilarious!
B000UVT3OI|1.0|A costly, ludicrous collection of songs about impotent, alcoholic, ineffectual men. Was the West won by simpering losers? I think not.
0425263908|5.0|Great trilogy to read after finishing 50 shades of grey.  This is very similar but with more of a story line.  I was very impressed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very easy to play, fun objective all around. look forward to playing on lunch breaks as a relaxing time killer.
0425263916|5.0|Very similar to 50 shades of grey but with more of a story line and it was a great suspense and love story!
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Thorn is a soulful,introspective singer-songwriter who ought to be better known. Maybe this reflective Christmas albums will win her some  new fans. Instead of tired retreads of traditional songs (well, there's one beautiful version of &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34;), she offers her own works, as acutely personal and universal as the amazing tunes on the album &#34;Love and Its Opposite.&#34; Don't miss this one--and all her other records!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I didn't want to see this but was very glad after I had seen it. It was very good animation, the story was excellent and now I look forward to seeing it again!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book tells a great story from human and faith perspectives. I would recommend it overall, but there sometimes is a little too much repetition for me and some of the medical technical terminology can be a little boring unless you're into that end of things.
B002VWNID6|2.0|Great movie, horrible quality dvd. Grainy, terrible picture. Never seen a dvd look this bad. I have lots of dvd's and none of them look like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good read!?! Normally I read the book then watch the movie but I didn't this time. I'd recommend to all ages :)
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This is a delightful comic opera, from beginning to end.  A lot of memorable music, in addition to the famous &#34;Una Furtiva Lagrima.&#34;  I recommend it for every opera fan's collection.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|5 out of 5 for a great suspenseful story and narrative.<br /><br />One of my favorite DS games now. However, this game might not be for everyone, as it isn't action packed, but suspenseful. It has loads of puzzle solving which are cleverly created and fun. Also, tons of reading! :)<br /><br />It's sort of like a point-and-click-adventure type game, with a unrelenting engrossing narrative and entertaining puzzles thrown in where your decision making will decide what ending you will receive at the end. If you're like me, and don't mind reading into a fascinating story, which has a great narrative behind survival and trusting others to escape, then don't skip out on this title. It is definitely in it's own league of it's genre. With multiple endings, it offers variety in replay value.<br /><br />This may be the only choose your own adventure type game I have played on the DS, but as far as I can tell, this may yet be by far the best one on the NDS system!<br />BOTTOM LINE---worth your money!!
B000JJSRNY|5.0|I can't say enough good about this DVD!!  A very entertaining evening with excellent performances of all music by the artists, and the orchestra.  I recommend it for everyone's collection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suggested by my granddaughters.  Can't wait to read second and third books.  I am told they are excellent as well.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Out of everything that I ever bought from Amazon on vinyl, Jack White - Blunderbuss is my BEST purchase yet!<br /><br />I am an experienced audiophile collector. I have quite a collection of both vintage and new vinyl records.<br /><br />And out of my experience I've learned that when it comes to vinyl releases, there are artists that are either Passionatly in Love with it, or just do it because they want to cover the marketing gap...<br /><br />Without any doubt, Jack White, The Founder of White Stripes and Third Man Records Label is an artist of the FIRST category!<br /><br />He stated it himself many times that he is a huge vinyl geek! So it's only natural that he would want to make his records a perfect vinyl experience for true gourmets like himself!<br /><br />DON't MISS OUT on this ONE!<br /><br />This is one of the best albums of a dacade not only music wise but production, mastering and package wise!<br /><br />The sound of analog equipment used when recording and producing this record is MESMERIZING!!!<br /><br />THIRD MAN RECORDS RULE!!!
0440246210|5.0|If you are like I am then you will know these people.  Every community has a gossip or two, a bootlegger, a philanderer, a madam, and one who always takes the short cut instead of \\"doing it right the first time.\\"  The characters are drawn skillfully and sometimes it is hard to dislike their actions because of their personalities.<br /><br />Generally, I do not like short stories.  However, these were all different and enjoyable to read.  I recommend this book.  Also, Grisham's knowledge of the judicial system shines through to enlighten the rest of us.  Sometimes it really is an old boy network.
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|First of all let me say that I'm an experienced old school audiophile and meloman. My faviourite bands are The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, etc...I trully believe in the saying that all the best stuff was done and written\recorded in the 60s\70s...BUT...<br /><br />At the same time I also believe that everything in this universe is cyclical! And in my humble opinion, there is no doubt nor denying that the music is \\"Getting Back to where it once belonged!\\"<br /><br />In the last 10 years world has seen light of the old school revival and the rise of such young talents as The Black Keys, Tame Impala, Astra, Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeroes, Rival Sons, Joe Bonamassa, Alabama Shakes, Melody's Echo Chamber, etc...<br /><br />I'm really loving what's happening with the modern rock scene nowadays and I am really excited about it's future! I can't even remember the time when I was last this excited about new bands and new records like those of Tame Impala and The Black Keys! I think that these two bands are the future classics and eventually make their way into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as the Legends of our time!<br /><br />As for Tame Impala and their debut album, Innerspeaker! It is absolutely AMAZING and MIND BLOWING!<br />Their sound is soooooooo vintage and hippie you'll feel like you're in Liverpool back in 1967!<br /><br />The vocalist and band-leader - Kevin Parker not just sounds LIKE John Lennon, he is literally channeling HIM through his melodic phrases, lyrics and rhythmic groove!<br /><br />Overall the sound of the band can be described as Syd Barret, T.REX and  Sgt. Pepper Era Beatles taking in a little bit too much of LSD and \\"trip\\" out like there's no tomorrow!<br /><br />The vinyl that I bought was of exceptionally good quality! A tidy good ole gatefold, not too thick but the polygraphy is of good quality. The vinyl is very aestethically pleasing and very well pressed! The sound is warm and analog reminiscent of thefirst pressing of Abbey Road record that I also own.<br /><br />I don't usually buy vinyls in an off hand way. I make sure I only collect the BEST or Something that is trully a masterpiece. Tame Impala definitely deserves a  LOT of more credit than it currently has. But I have faith that things will soon change, since bands like The Black Keys finally reached mainstream and commercial succes and served as an inspiration example for a new generation of bands to stay true to what they love and believe in.<br /><br />I would recommend this band to everybody who can trully appreciate the magic of REAL music and not the lady gaga and justi beaver s*** that has consumed the world!<br /><br />Tame Impala and The Black Keys! Remember those two bands for in 5-10 years, they will become the biggest bands on the planet!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I have owned the hard copy of this book and audio version for 15 years. Practicing the seven spiritual laws will change your life in ways you cannot imagine. Meditation is the key to start this process. Trust the infinite organizing power. The rest takes care of itself.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|I liked the book slot but it kind of felt like more of the same. The Percy Jackson series was great. This is laugh out loud funny, but the plot line is really over used. The jokes are hilarious but too similar to the Percy Jackson series a quick easy read, but don't expect it to be new or fresh.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|More than filled my needs. There are cheaper units around, but<br />a Nikon unit will allow better future expansion. The Nikon flash guide<br />is really helpfull.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|El servicio excelente y la colección es imperdible....Muy buena adquisición, el formato es excelente, la presentación de los discos, una gran compra.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Sure, its not as stylish as the original movie, but Boondock Saints II flows more like a mainstream Hollywood film with less jumping from scene to scene, plus it is easier to follow the storyline.<br /><br />I bought the movie along with the first for five dollars each at my local Walmart. I liked it slightly more than the first one thanks to Julie Benz as the sexy FBI agent and the twist at the very end. I hope that there will be a third installment, but not with a ten year gap.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|I bought this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend. We both love the series and wish it were still on but since its notwe have been collecting the seasons and we watch them from time to time. This is the last one now our collection is complete. I am sure she will be delighted when she opens it on christmas day.
B004TI5N38|3.0|it was not my type of book.  Too much military vocabulary.  Had a good story line, but slow in places.
B009ZE27US|1.0|totally not what I expected sister= 5 what age she got = 26! O-O though it was funny it also said I was 43! oh and how was my grandma 28! I'm so mot that age!
B008AX1HD8|3.0|I love Nesbo's books, the way they are plotted, so gripping they draw you in.  This one was the first in the series and it wasn't as sharp with the same flow as the others I've read.  This was definitely a first novel.  But in saying that it was still gripping and I did enjoy it.  It just wan't a page-turner like some of the others he's written.  The plot wasn't as clever but it did give some of Harry's background.<br />Having visited Sydney in the past and stayed at King's Cross I could relate to the setting.  Going back to the plot I just felt it was a little contrived.  Although it was still a good read and a lot better than many other crime thrillers out there!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I love it and have watched it several times over the years. The Deluxe Edition is about 24 minutes longer and adds some depth to the character development and film as a whole. If you have seen this, you know how awesome it is. Well, I suppose the story and violence might be too much for some, but if you are cool with the genre, than this is a must-see flick. The casting and performances of all the leads couldn't be better. Jean Reno and Gary Oldman are perfect as is Danny Aiello in a supporting part. But Natalie Portman is especially impressive. If good actors appear to be NOT acting, she proved her skill in this film.
B009VB998I|5.0|Disney delivers again with their standard style of story-telling and top notch animation.  Of course, it's just in time for their seasonal merchandising opportunities, too.
0316228532|3.0|While J.K Rowlings writing style is as fascinating as always, the whole story was utterly depressing. Lots of people responsible for their own misery. I was glad when I finished it and am even more glad to trade it away now.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|If you still love Seth MacFarlane, in his many incarnations, then you will love this movie.  In my opinion, this movie is a poorly repackaged and repurposed vehicle for MacFarlane's overly done 80's-referenced, crass, crude comedy.  If you have seen American Dad or Family guy, you have seen this movie.<br /><br />I could not finish watching this movie.  It is obnoxious, not funny, and unoriginal.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I am happy with these - they are very nice replacement for the rubbery plantronic ear covers that fall apart from sunlight and normal use.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Interesting twists but kind of slow movie. Could have been more character depth and action. Overall, a nice way to kill some time.
1603425381|5.0|The only negative I can think of is that a few really basic edgings should be included for the absolute newbie.<br />I am not that new but many times  a simple 5ch loop works well and a few others of that<br />type would round out the subject I think.<br />Highly recommended!!
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book and the service was fantastic it got to me extremely quickly :) there is nothing I have to complain about and I would recommend this product onto anyone.
B0076DELIG|4.0|There is nobody better at writing a crime novel than Connelly and there is no better detective in fiction than Bosch. Great read!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I chose this rating because it is the truth everything about how fast and how affecient it got to me helped also
0785163174|5.0|This is one of the greatest stories ever published by marvel.  This book is imperative for any collector, whether &#34;x-menmaniac&#34; or &#34;avengersmaniac&#34;.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|While the story is more than a little creepy, the book sucks you in.  Once you start reading, you can't put it down.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This works perfectly for iphones. i used the 4 and 5 on it, and it works. I bet it wouldn't work on the giant androids, but the regular one is fine. definitely wouldn't work with ipad mini.<br /><br />also if you take off the phone holder you can attach regular digital cameras, but any DSLRs will be too heavy.<br /><br />for the price, its great. it would be worth the price alone just for the phone holder to use with other tripods.
B005Z28M58|1.0|This will be a short review, but let me preface it by saying that I truly believe<br />the series was never the same after Nicollette Sheridan left the show (or was forced<br />to leave).  Marc Cherry tried oh so desperately to compensate for losing Edie<br />Britt's character, but let's face reality here---Sheridan's character was so dynamic<br />and interesting that replacing said character was next to impossible.  God knows Cherry<br />tried with Dana Delaney and Vanessa Williams, but they never even really came close to<br />capturing the same powerful presence that Sheridan brought to the show.  And the fact<br />that Cherry and the powers-that-be at ABC canned Sheridan's character to me is highly<br />suspicious.  Be that as it may, who has suffered most (besides Sheridan)?<br />The fans, of course.<br /><br />I hated pretty much everything about this last season (and seasons 6 and 7 weren't<br />too hot, either).  As a viewer, I have a definitive gut feeling that much of this<br />season (and the previous two seasons) were lacking in strategic writing detail and<br />thought, and much of it was forced on-the-go.  There were too many gaps and weak<br />character development to think otherwise.<br /><br />For instance, Renee Perry's character was painful to watch.  I felt that Vanessa Williams<br />never really got in the zone with her character.  Her part always seemed forced to me,<br />and it appeared as if she was always trying to compensate for something.  She never grew<br />on me, so you can imagine how I felt when she married a broke real estate developer after<br />knowing him for such a short period of time.  After getting dumped on in her first marriage,<br />who but the most naive and desperate writer expects us to believe this would/should happen?  I<br />mean, come on....<br /><br />Susan.  Poor Susan.  Her first husband is a complete loser, and hey, how do we reward Susan's<br />beautiful character and amazing acting throughout at the end of thisseries after she has finally<br />found her soulmate?  Let's have a lone shark turned drive-by shooter kill him.  Booorrrriiiinnnnngggggg.<br />Hey Marc, you've already killed off way too many important characters in this series, as is.  What was<br />running through your head when you decided to bust a cap in Delfino?  Let's send Susan away<br />from Wisteria Lane so she can look after Julie's baby while she finishes school.  A really<br />wonderful end to such a great character.  Not.<br /><br />Bree has been through more men than you can shake a stick at, and the fact that Cherry decided<br />to make Bree a person with loose morals doesn't quite gel with the sound moral constitution<br />she has displayed throughout the series.  And while it was interesting to see her hook up with<br />her lawyer Trip at the end (mainly because it was fun to see how such opposites were attracted<br />to each other), it was a far stretch of the imagination to believe the validity of her character<br />arch beyond Wisteria Lane.  She has more skeletons in her closet than you can shake a stick at,<br />and we're to believe she got into politics?  Are you serious, Cherry?<br /><br />We all knew Lynette and Tom were going to get back together, and the fact that Cherry split them<br />up in the first place was simply filler material for a dying series. And Katherine Mayfair coming<br />back to The Lane to offer Lynette a top job in an area she has no affiliation with can be hurled<br />into the \\"this would only happen in an alternate universe\\" lump of bad Marc Cherry decisions.<br /><br />And we all know how probable it is for a high school dropout and former beauty queen to get her<br />own line and own TV show, right?  Wrong, but this is Gabrielle's future, with neutered and metro-<br />sexual purse carrying I'm-not-the-bread-winner-anymore hubby Carlos.  Oooookay, if Marc Cherry<br />says it's so, then so be it.  But don't expect me to respect such stupidity.  Be that as it may,<br/>I have always liked the Gabby/Carlos dynamic, and I am glad they stayed together.  But Cherry,<br />as with so many of his less-than-stellar decisions on this series, rewards people with things<br />they should not be rewarded for.<br /><br />And let's not forget about all the loose end characters on this series.  What happened to Bob and<br />Lee, the Scavo kids, the Solis kids, the Van de Kamp siblings, Orson, et cetera and so on?  More Marc<br />Cherry loose ends that the fans of the show never quite get answers to.  No worries, I'm sure<br />Marc made lots of money on the show and that's what really matters, not sound writing and fan loyalty.<br /><br />Lastly, and there will be varying opinions on this point, but I hated the ending.  Throughout the show,<br />I wanted to see the series end with all of the characters staying on The Lane, growing old together and<br />sharing each other's lives.  I didn't want to see this band of sisters disbanded to different corners<br />of the country.  Indeed, the emotional fluidity of the show and the strong character interdependencies<br />lent itself to the strong belief and idea that the geography of these characters would not change because they<br />couldn't live without each other and the bonds they had forged with one another.  Marc Cherry obviously saw<br />things differently, and I think he ended the series with another mistake.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Marc Cherry did a lot of things right on this show, but he did a lot of things wrong,<br />too.  And when the dust settles and the history of television looks back on this series, it's the<br />glaring mistakes that will define this show.  After watching this series in its entirety, two words<br />come to mind:  lost potential.
0486406482|1.0|I bought this book because my book group had chosen it for a &#34;classic&#34; read.  I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time and money on this book.  I could barely get through the first 50 pages or so until I gave up on it.  As far as I'm concerned, the characters were worthless and their activities were pointless.  Why anyone still reads Jane Austen is beyond me.  If this book is an example of her writing, it is terrible!  People in my book group said her other works are better but I won't be reading them.
1451695195|5.0|&#34;Proof of Heaven: a Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife&#34;  is an awesome testimony that everyone should read it is an inspring story about how we should  all share our faith

B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|Rihanna's Loud Tour dvd finally came out! Rihanna is a great performer and she is amazing to see live. I saw the actual concert, but really loved that a dvd came out for it because it allowed me to relive this amazing moment. She puts so much energy into her performance! Great concert :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Although I've seen Nicholas Sparks' movies, this is the first book I've read by him and I LOVED it! I couldn't put the book down

0525478817|5.0|My son is a cancer survivor. He wanted me to read this book I guess so I could understand feelings that he was experiencing but could not express.  He also mentioned how he was treated by his peers during his treatment and how far removed her felt from them.  He is telling me something through this book. I love that he trusted me with such an amazing book. Now I like Hazel, want to know more. What HAPPENS WITH HAZEL?  does she live or does she join Gus in heaven.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This told the story of Steve Jobs without hero worship or white-wash.  It is fascinating that a man who was given away for adoption as a child should grow up to revolutionize a significant part of the American economy!
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Love Christmas music, and this had some good version of some classic songs. Really like these versions of The Christmas Waltz, and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I'm a fairly passive music listener (so maybe not as critical as others) and I thought all of the songs, with the exception of Little Saint Nick, were pretty good.
B008NW67E0|5.0|If you liked their first album this one won't disappoint. Especially The Boxer with special guest Paul Simon! Can't wait for their next one!!
0393061310|4.0|The non-politically correct title of the book should be, \\"Why does the White man rule the world?\\"<br /><br />After finishing the book, I still have some questions unanswered, but now have a better geographical and linguistic understanding of human evolution. The author makes a pedestrian case for why White people ended up ruling the world. I say pedestrian because after reading the book, I still don't feel sold with his argument. I definitely agree with him, that the western world (white man) rules the world, but the way he lead up to his final thesis and conclusion did not fully satisfy the question.<br /><br />Despite that, what I loved about the book was how the author walks the reader through the geographical and human history of all races in the world, and how they ended up on the continents they are now known to inhabit. I learned that there were three Black races in Sub-Saharan Africa: Negroids, pygmies, and the third became extinct. But what blew my mind was learning that one of these races was one of the first inhabitants of South Asia and Australia, which led to the Australian Aborigines. This s*** just blew my mind!<br /><br />Tree of Indo-European Languages<br /><br />But where the book stands out, was how it was able to objectively prove and figure these things out via science, and to my surprise, linguistics. If any thing, I learned how crucial human languages can be used to figure out the evolutionary history of peoples inhabiting a particular region.<br /><br />For instance, take a look at England. Comparing the English language to other European languages, linguists deduce that English evolved from Germanic languages. Looking at the linguistic history of Germanic languages, they can tell that they evolved from other Indo-European languages. If you now match this up to actual history, it is SPOT ON! England was inhabited by the Anglo-Saxons, who were descendants of Indo-Europeans. The fact that the evolution of human languages could be so through in telling us human geographical history and evolution, was quite eye opening.<br /><br />This book gets a thumbs up for that alone.<br /><br />To wrap up, if you want to know the question to the answer of why the white man (western world) rules the world, despite being the smallest of the main groups (Asians, Africans, etc.), then this book will not fully satisfy your appetite. It will quench it and explain the issue with guns, germs and steel. However, you will still be left hungry, but that is more a reflection on the magnitude of the question and the history of the world itself, rather than the book.<br /><br />The book is a great read if you want to learn more about human evolutionary and lingual history.d evolution, was quite eye opening.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really liking this game.  Great graphics and music.  G5 keep putting out games like this,  u have me hooked on your games.
B00001OH7J|5.0|I don't know why this one wasn't released on CD in the USA til very recently but its one of his best studio albums.<br />Well worth the price of admission.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Anyone interested in Revolutionary War/early American history simply must see this.  Top notch acting and riveting story.  From the research I've done, it also seems to be highly accurate, historically speaking, with only small liberties being taken here and there.  A great addition to any collection.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|I enjoyed the book not because of the questions it answered but the questions it created.  Working in education and seeing how things are trending, there is change coming and I think this book does a good job in beginning the dialogue of getting education out of the Enlightment and into the post-modern world.
B001F3FUK6|5.0|I know this movie had its critics, but I really like it.  Maybe even love it.  Brandon Routh is under appreciated in my opinion, both as Clark Kent and as Superman.  I would've really liked to have seen him in subsequent sequels.<br /><br />In fact, from what little I've seen of the upcoming Christopher Nolan Superman title, I think I still prefer the overall look from this film; not just the actor, but the suit, too.  Of course, Christopher Nolan works magic, so we'll see.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as Blu-Rays are concerned, I don't think this is the best transfer I've seen, but it's good.  I got a good deal on it, and it's a great addition to my collection.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|What better comment than &#34;Thanks Dad - this is great!&#34; He has brought it up several times and is very pleased.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? Seriously.  Robert Downey Jr. absolutely owns the role of Tony Stark.  And the Blu-Ray is top-notch.  Great audio and video.  Buy it.
0767817664|5.0|Favorite vampire of all time. Had to order it again thanks to an ex GF. It was shipped to me super quickly!
B001GQSY64|5.0|Huge Star Wars fan, so obviously I was going to like this.  But I ended up liking it more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Visually, I didn't notice a huge difference between the standard-def DVD experience versus this, but the high-def audio is great, especially if you have anything other than the stock TV speakers, which I do.<br /><br />If you're into Star Wars, buy it.  You know you want to.
0792164903|5.0|Love Johny Depp and Christine Ricci. Very well done Halloween movie! Like the special effects and the Ichabod Crane story in and of itself.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|First, this is a great film that I've been a big fan of for years.  I loved it so much, in fact, that it inspired me to finally check out Firefly, from which it is derived.  Which I also thoroughly enjoyed - but that's another review.<br /><br />I bought the Blu-Ray over a year ago, but just barely got around to taking off the shrink wrap a few days ago.  lol  What a great movie!  And the Blu-Ray experience is even better.  The picture looked especially crisp to me, surprising since Universal has a bad reputation for its Blu-Ray offerings.  But the audio...the audio is fantastic.  I really love the soundtrack during the last ~5 minutes of the film, and it sounded AWESOME on my 5.1 setup.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi, you'll like this movie.  You might even love it.
B000H30B2C|5.0|Now I already own the theatrical version with bonus disc as well as the production diaries on dvd, but I can never get enough of the behind the scenes with Peter Jackson and his crew. It's great that there is new bonus material that has not been duplicated from other dvd sets plus i love listening to Peter and Philippa in the commentary walking us through the entire 3+ hour journey. Simply superb!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This movie has a very stylized look going on, so don't panic when you see the grain.  It's supposed to be there.  Sit back, crank up the audio, and hold on.<br /><br />Our arrows will block out the sun.  Then we will fight in the shade.<br /><br />Best movie line of 2006.
145210655X|5.0|I figured this would be a bit of a lark for a Star Wars fan. I bought it for a gift for my brother who has 2 sons. I ended up thumbing through it a bit when it arrived to make sure it was intact. Ended up actually reading the whole thing (very carefully to not damage it or crack the spine). ;)<br /><br />The content is just a bunch of scenes of a father and son but with the twist of Star Wars, Luke and Vader. It is surprisingly funny, touching and kind in nature. I really liked it.
B001FB55I0|4.0|So the Terminator franchise has gone downhill a bit.  I'll give you that.  But I love the concept of the Terminator series, and I'll continue to watch them as long as they keep making more.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray, it's good.  Can't go wrong with the high-def audio/video.  If you have an HDTV with anything other than the stock TV speakers, you really owe it to yourself to experience the uncompressed high definition audio.  Especially if you have a 5.1/7.1 setup.
1608862801|5.0|I was surprised at the size and quality of the material/paper/ink in this book. The colors are vibrant and beautiful, the paper is substantial and the whole thing feels like a quality book. The content is obviously Adventure Time. Nuts, funny, cute and friendly. Get it.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|What?  You don't own this yet?  Seriously?  Buy it, because this is the film that kicked off one of the best trilogies Hollywood has ever put out.<br /><br />This movie was already a 10.  The Blu-Ray merely cranks it up to 11.
0385535147|4.0|This is one of Grisham's better efforts.  The story line is similar to previous books but this one keeps the reader in suspense longer and has more surprising plot twists.  It is an easy read.  You probably won't finish in one session but you will want to.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This is a great movie, has been a favorite of mine for years.  So naturally, it was one of my first Blu-Ray purchases.<br /><br />Sure, the high-def video is great, but the real reason to get the Blu-Ray is for the audio.  This is one of the best-sounding titles I have in my collection.  Period.  Fantastic transfer.  If you have a 5.1/7.1 system, this is a must-buy.  Seriously.
0446580848|4.0|Another good Nelson DeMille book.  This one puts two favorite characters, John Corey and Paul Brenner (General's Daughter & Up Country) together on the same mission.  Can they get along?  Anyone who knows the characters will be interested to see and will know that the opportunities for wise cracks between the two are endless.  As usual, part of the fun is guessing who are the double crossing bad guys.<br /><br />Fans of DeMille will like this book.  People who have never read DeMille will probably love it.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Well, I bought this over a year ago and still haven't watched it.  lol  But it's a great movie.  Natalie Portman in high definition = win.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Well with it. Lots of levels for days of fun. Great game physics. And Vikings. Galaxy s III plays it perfectly every time.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I have the leather cover and stand and wanted a thinner, more lightweight cover to take with me. Good price and he stand works fine, but only on a table or flat surface, whereas the leather one I can put on a pillow or in my lap when lying down.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|The book is very good (of course! A classic!) Jane Austen is always a great reading.<br />But this book has a lot of typos. I bought the kindle version and the typos were annoying.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I love this app. It saved me a few times during Calculus II for limits and series and sequences. It gets you a lot of the Wolfram Alpha &#34;Pro&#34; features, anywhere on your phone. Unfortunately, it does require internet to work, but it works really well.
0679809015|5.0|My nephew loved having books read to him by 8 weeks.  My first, took almost 8 months to interest him in books, and being my first, I wasn't sure if that was normal, or if the norm was my nephew.  This was the book my sister shared with me.  It has little flaps that you open or lift to show a farm animal, and kids just love it.  It is a small simple book.  Not much to it really, but kids just love it.  The small size allows them to hold the book themselves to lift the flaps on their own.  Ours came with a couple of broken \\"doors\\" but our son still loved it.<br /><br />When our second one arrived, he was even less interested in books than our first.  He had no patience with any books and just flipped through the pages as if that was the purpose of books, giving us not even enough time to read the first syllable of the text.  This book held his attention longer than any book as he would at least spend some time flipping the flaps before turning the page.  He learned all the animal sounds from us reading this book to him.  He eventually liked it so much he would take it to the car on our commute to daycare/work.  Unfortunately, our commute is very long and one evening, he was bored enough that he decided to rip all the flaps and even managed to eat a few.  So I would say, this book has captivated 3 very different children and provided some ripping exploration to the last child; not bad for a $4 book.
0553328255|5.0|Two books, cheap price. I like a physical book to read. It's what I wanted. I haven't finished them all yet, but I've enjoyed it all so far.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Really? What dumb butt would fall for this??? Oh yeah...I did...........Forget I said that...Soooooo...back to the app: it stinks. There's really no point. Don't be a dumb butt and fall for this Like I did, its a fake.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|ive been hung on this series for ever.  Even though last season (doomsday killer) was probably the least liked of all of them, this season blew me away. I cant wait for it to go on sale (i have all the rest) and im dreding the conclusion of the series.  I understand next season will be the last.  I know it cant go on forever but i have so enjoyed this show.  along with six feet under and deadwood, it rates as the best.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I cannot even start a new book at this point because I am completely in love with George R.R. Martin's world. I will not give away any of the plot. This is the fifth book in an incredible series that is a MUST READ for fans of fantasy or historical fiction. Very graphic sex and violence. Be prepared to be immersed.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My son loves bey blades, as do all the kids at his school.  My son only has some of the more common beys, though, and he made a comment about one of the beys that one of the other kids has that wins all of the battles.  So, for his birthday, I thought I'd try to find one that was less common and had more endurance.  After searching through lots and lots of reviews on Amazon, i finally ran across this one.  The other reviews mentioned how well balanced this one was, and one youngster posted a review that he had gotten his Phantom Orion to spin for 13 minutes.  I figured my son would like the color as well, so I ordered this one.  Boy, no kidding! It really is well balanced.  It's a bit heavier than most other beys, so it does indeed spin much much longer, and it &#34;pops&#34; the other bey blades when they crash into this one.  It usually does win.  So my son is delighted.  He has a bey that wins a lot of its battles, and it's not the same as all the other kids' bey blades.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love these books. A friend recommended them and I cannot thank her enough. I cannot get enough of the series. Patiently waiting for book 6 to be released. My only complaint is when searching for these you will see that some of these books were previosuly published as two and later combined into one... so it gets confusing as to which book comes first or if there is a book you have perhaps missed reading.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|Possibly one  of the 10 best albums ever made.  If you  like virtuosic music, a great story, and a bit of raunchy humor and political satire Joe's Garage is a must own.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is the exception. HBO has dont an amazing job of capturing the world created by George R.R. Martin. I was so happy to be able to share the world I have been immersed in (read all five books before buying season 1) with my friends and not be constantly trying to explain why the books were better. Great series.. still waiting on Season 2 to ship.
0345803507|1.0|One of the worst series of books I have ever read.  I too can't believe it made the best sellers list.  A teenager could (and probably has) written a better book.  This just goes to show how hype can put a book on the best sellers list and that anyone, ANYONE, can put a book out there.  I call it a Harlequin romance with porn.  Basic story, poor girl meets rich man, poor girl marries rich man.  Add porn and that's the story.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I sort of wish we had known that the main actor dies after this first season was completed (they replace the actor in later seasons). It took a few episodes to used to the &#34;new&#34; Spartacus. This is a VERY GRAPHIC series. The violence is epic and a pointedly cornball in how graphic it is. The sex scenes are steamy and fully nude (male and female). Slavery and forced sex is also graphically depicted. The plot line is awesome and keeps us coming back for more.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Most of it was common sense, didn't learn anything new. I was expecting a book on techniques on how to create more engaging conversation.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|This movie didn't play at first in my DVD player. I had a witness that I unwrapped it fresh and put it in the DVD player and it wouldn't play.  But after about the 5th try, it worked and has continued to work. Not sure what the problem was but GREAT movie.
0061992860|5.0|very detailed with pics. Must have in any emergency kit. Small size makes easy for packing. Get the real paper version instead of digital version.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This was the last movie made and the last movie needed for my dvd collection.  Great movie like the rest of them. Love Michael Ealy.
B005Y1B3Q0|4.0|The extended cut definitely offers a better experience.  The crisp, clear sound and video quality are superb.  I was disappointed, however, that there was no spanish audio track, like in most other blu-ray DVDs.  Considering that the movie was made by an independent studio, I guess it's one of the reasons, but overall, the bonus features make up for this little oversight.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I was worried that this wasn't the movie with Sam Worthington.  The art in the front is drawn like a colored picture almost. But this is the exact movie I wanted. Thank you.
B000002PCS|4.0|If you like the movie, you'll like the sound track.  It's not something you'll hear on the radio or most anyplace else.
0307387178|2.0|The book said it was in good-great condition however the cover was completely bent and so were the pages, it wasnt too bad but it really wasnt good or great.
030759565X|5.0|Can't wait to try all the recipes!  Very entertaining and its fun to read!!! Makes a great book for a gift too!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love IZ Hawaiian music very much and this is my second CD i bought this year .<br />I am very sad he is not here anymore.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you want to still down and have a great laugh, this show is it.  I do recommend you start with season 1 so you get all the back story.
1451695195|5.0|Enjoyed this book, although the terminology sometimes got a little heavy. But hearing an account from a physician who operated and was familiar with brain functions, made you really think. I would recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Felt a little repetitive but at the end it pulled itself together.<br />I would recommend the book for a good read.
B005B19UPE|5.0|I rented the movie after reading the book.  Both were so intense.  I wasn't sure if the movie could capture the story but it was excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A  very fast  paced  story  that  holds your interest until the end. Would recommend this book to readers who like science fiction as well.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This game is an all time favorite growing up.  (Yahtzee). And is still fun to play with my friends and family.  Now we don't have to be together to play.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I have my E17 docked into the FiiO E09K. By itself the E17 is great with lots of power but I'm using the pair to push Audio-Technica's ATH-M50s. See the pictures I uploaded.
0061801313|5.0|I'm a 20 something year old girl and I love the Pretty Little Liars series. The Price is really good. The shipping was fast. The box and books were in really good condition when I got them. Nothing to really complain. I think this would make a great gift for a teenaged girl.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3 Dark Knight flicks, on Blu-Ray, for $28?  Yes please!  Greatest super hero trilogy of all-time looks simply stunning on HD Blu-Ray.  Must-have for fans.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Although written from an American perspective, this book has solid guidance and advice to help change your perspective on income.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|Not all those old Living Stereo recordings can stand up to the passage of many decades, but this does it in style. Reiner and the CSO put on a grand Russian show on this disc, starting off with one of my favorite renditions of Ravel's Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, or perhaps my favorite, period. Toss in Glinka's Russlan and Ludmilla Overture, Tchaikovsky's Marche slave and marche miniature from Suite No. 1, the Polovtsian March of Borodin, Kabalevsky's lesser-played Colas Breugnon Overture and a rousing performance of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain, and you've got one heckuva program. The playing is energetic and buoyant and the sound crisp. Recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey there I have it for kindle obviously, but anyway I've been wondering... I've seen a lot of YouTube videos on how to survive your first night on survival mode and I see in version 0.5.0 that you don't get doors as a option to make, or a wooden pick axe. Is that just my copy or is it suppose to be like that? Other than that the game is great :) haha I love it and recommend it for all rpg fans
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I usually prefer contemporary romance over historical but The Duchess War makes me happy to get outside of my comfort zone.<br />Others have discussed the plot so I'll skip the details. Instead, I'll say that I love this book for its excellent storytelling and because it has none of the romance cliches. I delighted in many of the unexpected events so won't ruin the twists and turns for you. She also has a way with humor, which is wonderful given the somber mood of much of the activity. The sly exchanges between the Brothers Sinister (Robert, Oliver & Sebastien) are great, and Violet, Sebastien's neighbor, gives as good as any of the boys. The wittiest of all is Minnie herself. She is the epitome of not judging a book by its cover.<br /><br />Ms. Milan is also a technically excellent writer and the book is well edited - there are few typos (I actually don't remember any, which surprises me) and no distracting sentence construction. There are a LOT of details that I would assume are correct, such as factory working conditions, indicating that Ms. Milan does her research.<br /><br />Since not all readers have the same taste, I would mention that when I do read historical romances, it's often Lisa Kleypas or Candace Camp. Grace Burrowes, however, is the closest writer to whom I would compare Ms. Milan.<br /><br />I will definitely re-read this book and would purchase other Courtney Milan books based on how well this is written. In fact, I would preorder anything that she's releasing in the future because of how well I liked this one. :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|awaiting the more challenging levels,  but so far a bit ingeniously addicting.<br /><br />Not sure about other games from this creator, but I would watch for the constant upgrade reminders.
B0091QS88K|5.0|She loves this game. We had to help her in the beginning, but she got it really quick. It is the most played game on the tablet for sure :D She will tell me proudly she is cooking :D
B005LLX582|1.0|I am watching it now and it really is awful. I don't know why anyone would want to make this movie. I would not recommend watching it much less buying it. Awful.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I got this to hold a small camcorder which had no external mount  for lighting. This provides a comfortable and balanced &#34;cradle&#34; for both camcorder and light. Plus it looks pretty cool.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Great movie, funny and well done, amazon instant was great, got it very quickly and the quality was great as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|really great buy not to mention how much you save pre ordering if your patient to wait a few days after its release date
B00650SSWG|5.0|Great movie, funny and well done, amazon instant was great, got it very quickly and the quality was great as well.
B005LAII9O|5.0|well worth purchasing...save you even more money pre ordering if your patient to wait a few days after its release date.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|the sequel to the Phantom of the Opera-  awful.  I loved the first movie/story.  This sequel ruins it.  Don't watch it!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This set arrived very quickly. It is to be a gift so I won't be opening it. I watched the series on TV and love it.
034580404X|1.0|These books are a complete waste of time.  Much the same as other reviewers, I was coerced by co-workers to read them.  The characters in this book are extremely disturbed.  I cannot even remotely imagine a young woman who would subject herself to someone who is this messed up and in a very short time believe that it is acceptable behavior.  She is equally messed up if she believes this is all life has to offer her.  If the \\"f\\" word is removed from the book, it would be a single book rather than a trilogy.  Again, agreeing with another reviewer, at first the explicit sex descriptions were ok but I too wondered when it would end.  It got old really fast. I forced myself to finish book three only because I wanted to see if a story ever developed.  There is no story, no real plot.  Rich, extremely disturbed man seduces an innocent woman and makes her believe that she is the luckiest girl in the world to have her \\"Fifty Shades.\\"
145470246X|4.0|I am looking forward to trying several of the designs in this book, and the instructions seem to be easy to follow. Quick shipment.
160094048X|5.0|I purchased this book and Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World for my cousin's birthday. She loves them both and has had a great time baking her way through them.
B0036OS3FG|5.0|Very comfortable , used for my snow trip family adventure and I love it, keep you warm, comfy , nice quality and price.
1569242739|5.0|I purchased this book and Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar for my cousin's birthday. She loves them both and has had a great time baking her way through them both. These make a great gift!
0812992784|4.0|Rusdies's story telling is great and incidents and events were believable. Only negative was the name-dropping I found that a bit much.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great game!!!!  It works for me on the kindle fire and it only had to &quot;force close&quot; twice but then opened right back up.  It would be worth it to get it.  It's free-if it doesn't work on your device, delete it!!!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I had originally bought this book to read because of the movie by studio Ghibli, hoping to find it as mesmerizing and enchanting as the movie. I was glad that I did. It was much better than the movie in certain aspects, like Sophie's backstory, how her family played an important role in the story, and how many of the characters, such as Micheal, had a history that was explained; but I was very upset how Sophie's and Howl's relationship didn't really spark up and was made obvious until the last few chapters where in the movie it was made evident about half way through.<br /><br />Overall, it's a must read for any one who has seen the movie and was thinking they might want to read the book; and a must read for those who just plain want to have an enjoyable novel of witches, wizards, and adventure with a splash of romance.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am on the 1st book and it is hard to put down. I saw the 1st 2 seasons on HBO to Go. It helped give me a good visual of all the players and I think makes it easier to understand.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|it's the best movie in there I love the vampire it's the best season ever are they are vampires there wolves andwhich
B003VANOFY|2.0|This headset had an issue from the start, would randomly stop working. Sent in for RMA, second headset does not produce this issue, but causes some sort of driver confliction. Driver will fail, and cause all usb drivers to fail. So your mouse, keyboard, and headset all stop working at the same time. Does it repeatedly. Once device is removed from the system all game crashes and glitches stop. I am a game Alpha and Beta tester in my spare time. This headset caused far too many issues. If you are a casual gamer, it is fine. If you spend more than 2 hours a day at the computer, pass this by, wait for the technology to improve.
B005SV9X22|5.0|Love Lady Gaga! And this concert played on HBO is amazing! DVD is in perfect condition! Paid about $15.00 dollars and that included shipping. Item arrived in about a week from the regular postal service. Very happy!
B00138KISM|3.0|Sure, it's late eighties predecessors, Constrictor (1986) and Raise Your Fist And Yell (1987) had their moments, but, I believe this was a stronger effort. Remember the problem that started weighing down a lot of the 'hair metal' genre was the over indulgent, excessively long guitar solos that marred Raise Your Fist & Yell. I got to see Alice during this tour in Miami,FL at the James L. Knight Center and he killed it! His live show lived up to and exceeded my expectations. This album has a lot of good cuts: \\"Poison\\",Spark in the Dark\\" , \\"House of Fire\\" ,\\"Why Trust You\\" \\"This Maniac's in Love with You\\" & the title track,\\"Trash\\" . The rest is pretty much forgetful filler ca-ca.
0141329394|5.0|Great story read a second time. Very descriptive classic. I recommended it for the young reader and old enthusiast. Favorite.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a great book and fun to read. It is similar to one of his other books. I can't recall the name of it. That is the reason for the four stars.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|What a smart story!  It isn't often that I find myself stopping to savor a chapter and thinking:  \\"Gosh this is a good book!\\"  That was my feeling almost from the very start.  The plot held together, the  dialogue was excellent and the fact that both characters spoke forthrightly (to each other too!!!) made it that much more surprising and amusing.  This story is well written and is one of the rare romance novels that provides  a different view of society and of the duties,  responsibilities and expectations of both the aristocracy and the working classes.  Ms Milan did some good historical research and found a way to present us with some historical realities of 1860s Britain and  to make it all interesting.  And what a treat to read a lovely story that also gives a little glimpse into things beyond the ballroom or the life \\"upstairs\\" in a country estate.  But I think the aspect I liked best was the excellent writing with made me feel for both the Hero and the heroine and how their HEA seemed like a real probability instead of a hopeful note to end the book. This book wasn't perfect (bit of a rushed ending, the easy \\"forgiveness\\" of the dowager Duchess, etc.) but these are but little quibbles.  I strongly recommend this one!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I liked the app until I had to update it. now anytime I send or even delete an email it forces close. I cant delete old emails...it wont let me perform the function and the &quot;push pull&quot; inconvenient.  before I got a notification of emails now im constantly refreshing it. Can I have the old app back please??
159420411X|4.0|I had just finished reading this book (I borrowed a copy from my local library).  Although I wouldn't spend money on this book, I had fun reading and digesting some of the materials.  Especially now I wanted to learn much more about doing Bayesian analysis on my own.  Nate is a smart and observant person.  For example, in one of the chapters about forecasting climate change, he commented that one of the \\"skeptics\\" I think named Armstrong, although a very smart guy (professor at Wharton), is actually very dumb in some aspects.  Armstrong only claimed to exercise his own brand of \\"scientific rigor\\" in climate change but not in other fields he studied.  This illustrates that this supposedly very smart individual is in fact very biased, and very dumb.<br /><br />I liked this book because it gave specific cases and examples that we are all biased in some way, although we don't ever admitted.  We just need to be mindful that humans are biased so that we can be more careful in our numerical analysis.
0307951529|5.0|Within the past week I devoted significant time to reading two books:<br />  [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Expanded and Updated)]] by Tim Ferris<br />  The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau<br /><br />Both of these books work synergistically, which helps connect the possibilities of the message that lie beneath both books. Plenty of other reviews talk about what that is. I would highly recommend both and plan to slowly read through and implement my new life through the material and concepts taught.<br /><br />To add something I feel is useful to other readers, I want to mention the main difference I got out of these books:<br /><br />Tim Ferris did what many other authors have done. I felt inspired, I felt powerful. I felt like a king while reading the book. I felt like my ego was being stroked. I was a powerful individual, har-har. Tim felt like the Coach that knows I have potential and lets me know. They believe in you, they give you resources, and they are widely successful themselves. He opened up the world of possibilities in an enlightening way, a way that made it seem worthwhile and not overwhelming. I cherish this.<br /><br />Chris Guillebeau brought me back to reality. He humbled me unlike Tim, and also added the resources I needed to hold onto the previous confidence I received from Tim's readings. I felt like Chris was a close friend while reading, more of a father figure than a coach. I trusted him and his intentions, I believed in his message. This in turn allowed me to know I can believe in that message, too. It will take work, there are many things to consider, but the resources to do it exist. It wasn't about my ego anymore, it was about me. Do I really want this? OK - let's work.<br /><br />I hope to one day meet Chris. I hope to one day thank Tim. The difference is, I don't think Chris realizes how important he is to many of his readers. He's a normal guy. He represents all of us. The contrast between these men is ultimately what I believe makes the topic of lifestyle design excel when you consider both of these books. If I were to suggest which to read first, I would suggest The 4-Hour Workweek.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game.  The only issue is the lost time I experiance from playing it.  This game is great.
B00000JSJC|4.0|This is what I call a good popcorn movie.  This is a good movie for a rainy day when you are stuck indoors. Fiennes and Juliette Lewis give strong perfomances, but the script is a bit weak.  Not a great movie, but a good solid movie
B000S0GYRU|3.0|I know that Suspiria is supposed to be one of the greats but I have no patience! Dario Argento is a genius in horror film making, but I cannot get into this one. I appreciate the story and the gore is nice for the most part, but there was simply too much buildup and not enough payoff. There is little reason to see this more than once or even own it, but is it at least worth a watch? Absolutely! To many horror fans, this ranks right up there with The Exorcist, Halloween or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The problem is this film is too slow for its own good.<br /><br />The film follows American ballet student Suzy Banyon who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany, only to discover that it is controlled by a coven of witches. The beginning is slow and it takes a while to introduce the characters. A good horror film? Ultimately yes! One of the greats? Not in my opinion!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  The cinematography, acting, and script are wonderful.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes stories about World War Two...
0547848412|1.0|Dragged myself through this book because my book club picked it and a friend with good judgement recommended it.  Book is disjointed, the center section on survival mildly interesting, the end a total ruin.  A starting premise is that all religions are the same, just love God sincerely.  Doesn't the author notice that the 3 religions mentioned make exclusive claims that contradict the others?  Sorry, but any one or none can be true, but they cannot all be true.  You have to choose. The carnivorous island seems to have no point at all in the plot or theme.  The ending as a twist does not hang together.  In \\"The Sixth Sense\\", for example, the revelation at the end makes things that were confusing in the beginning meaningful.  It is a deeper please to again watch the movie after you know the twist.  The ending of the Life of Pi, on the contrary, made me feel cheated.  If \\"the story without animals\\" is true, if Pi is the tiger, what does this say about his love of God or the existence of God?  There are no reflections about this.  It's like ending your novel by having the protagonist killed by a truck.  If this is a postmodernist construct and life and God have no meaning, why waste your fictional time and money reading this?  Tossing in world religions, a tiger, and a vast menu of Indian food names does not a readable novel make.
B00006C7G9|5.0|This is the best mini-series ever made!  I've wanted to buy Band of Brothers for about ten years and I finally got around to doing so.  I am a history buff of World War Two and this series hits the nail on the head.  I can not say enough about Band of Brothers.  There are several segments with the actual survivors of Easy Company through out the series.  If you’ve never seen Band of Brothers you are missing out on a great piece of work!!!
B007QPFGJW|1.0|Jo Nesbo disappointed this reader to the point of dozing and skimming through the pages. Will not try another title.
B00337KM2S|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  Outstanding performances by Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick.  The script is well written and the choice of shooting locations is well thought out.  This movie was shot in St. Louis and the people getting laid off are actual people who had recently lost their jobs.  Zach Galifianakis also has a small part.  I highly recommend this movie!!!

B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset. As a gamer it gives you that much needed directional sound for footsteps in shooters, and while not gaming the surround sound is great for movies. Music sounds awesome as well with the advanced equalizer to customize how much bass or treble you want depending on your genre of music.<br /><br />The 10-hour battery is great too and only takes about 2 or so hours to fully charge from almost dead and it can be used while plugged in while charging.  The cable length is good enough so that you dont feel too tied down at your desktop or desk chair.<br /><br />The wireless range is good, When listening to music I can walk all around my house and through closed doors and even into my back yard, once I get to the garage on the other side of the house it starts to get interference and will cut out though.  I Pharmacy student so it is cool to be able to study in the library with my music and if i need to walk around to another study group or bathroom I can just hang these around my neck and be on my way with no cords to tie you down.<br /><br />The noise suppression is good from the outside and I cant hear a thing with music or games going on but I can still communicate with other people them on and no sound.<br /><br />The mic works great as well, people say the voice quality is a lot clearer although I have not listened to myself too much through playback.
B00006JDVV|3.0|This is what I call a good popcorn movie.  Bale does a good job, as does McConaughey, but the story and script are weak. This a good movie for a rainy day. The movie is ok, but no great.
B00005LOUP|3.0|Great movie, I wated my daughter to enjoyed one of Christmas' must have movies. It was of such poor resolution, maybe it's bc we watch everything in HD and BlueRay, but this movie looked like if was copied off a VHS.

B008EQIEWS|1.0|the movie was streamed through amazon instant video, it was a little hurky jerky but good none the less.  However, the movie itself was pathetic.  some of the special effects were good, but nothing mind blowing and the product itself was lacking.  I was sorry i was so excited to see it.....
1451613512|5.0|Saw an Interview with Oliver Stone on Democracy Now and knew immediately that I wanted to read the book and watch the series. It has not be a disappointment.<br />Amazing new facts for a political junkie like me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this product gives you access to all action games.it also is exciting when you get to get a new game from the points you earned.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love this movie.  It's rather gross to see all the rats fall from the ceiling and pixar makes it so realistic.  Great story though.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Biggest pros:<br /><br />- It's made well, it looks nice.<br />- Accommodates several sizes of laptop (although I use it with my 13&#34; Macbook Air)<br />- I LOVE that I can put stuff underneath for storage. Typically I keep my USB external HD underneath<br />- Creates great airflow for your laptop<br /><br />And I literally have zero complaints about it. I'd recommend it to anyone with a laptop that they plug into a monitor on their desk.

B009E9QOEO|5.0|I'm going to start right off by dating myself. I remember when these guys released their first album. If you're too young to remember albums...Google. I was a fan from the start. I waited for every new album to see where they were going with their music. It didn't hurt I was a DJ at the time, so we got the promo albums ahead of the stores. It seemed like they were just getting better and better. In 1977 I was finally able to see them live. It was freaking awesome. No opening act. Nothing fancy. Just the band hammering the audience with 3 hours of great music. They played for almost an hour before Plant finally told the crowd: \\"Good evening.\\" Then came the day when John Bonham died. The band announced they were done. No more albums. No more shows. The end of an era. If you were a fan you held out the hope they might get together for one more show. One more album. Anything. But except for a few times, which in honesty, were kinda weak, it looked like Led Zeppelin was permanently grounded. Then the rumors started about a reunion for a tribute to Ahmet Ertegun, the man who signed them to Atlantic records. \\"Celebration Day\\" is the result. And it was worth waiting for. Some have said that Plant's voice is too weak for their songs now. But the critics have NEVER liked Zeppelin, so that's not a big surprise. All the classics are here. \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"Rock And Roll,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" and \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" Plus some others that are equally great. \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" \\"Nobody s Fault But Mine,\\" \\"No Quarter,\\" and \\"Dazed And Confused.\\" Page on guitar, John Paul Jones on bass, and even a Bonham on drums. Maybe they aren't as young as they used to be, but Hell, who is? At any rate they're WAY better than anyone out there right now stinking up the airways. At the end of their careers, I doubt that 20,000,000 fans would enter a lottery to get tickets for Biber, Ga Ga, or any of the other so called \\"musicians\\" out there. This is a CD set that is well worth the money. I didn't gofor the CD/BluRay set. Concert movies are never as good as being there. So order the CD set, turn down the lights, and crank the volume. You won't be disappointed. And since they most likely won't do this again, it could very well be the last time you get to hear the \\"Hammer Of The Gods\\" live. Now, I've got to get back to the music.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I love this. brings me back to the days I remember playing this. sounds just like it and plays just like it.

048622709X|5.0|This is an amazing guide for reference material and for helping figure out those issues you might have with hands.  I will say that it's not for a beginner, but if you really want to understand more about the hands in-depth it's a wonderful study guide.<br /><br />There are several pages where you see sketches that show partial hands that are really beautiful, and many parts where it goes in-depth with the hands, actually pointing out which muscles and joints are what, and how they fit into each other and how they move.  It starts out with the back view, palm view, thumb side, little finger side, then goes into the fingers and knuckles, ect.  And all the drawings are just beautiful to look at.<br /><br />All in all, I really loved this book!
0439882826|5.0|For both kids and adults.  Two favorite things about the book are the lighted light sabers in the back of the book, and the mini pop-up books contained within some of the pages of the book.  The book is well-made with sturdy paper and folds back into position easily when you are careful.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead.  I have been a zombie genre fan for years and now I am unintentionally hip.  Anyway, I missed an episode because I rarely remember to watch actual broadcast TV.  No worries - I bought this gem the next night and watched it anyway.  Once there is a way to stream live college football I will ditch cable/satellite forever and only watch Amazon and Netflix.  That is all.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|If your child likes to build using legos or other materials according to directions and has little interest in creative building, they may not appreciate this.  The advantage to these pricey building blocks is in their uniformity.  They are not warped and are cut very precisely so as to maximize stability in large structures.  The larger the structure you create, the more detail you can incorporate.  Think about a sketch of a bicycle that is drawn using nothing but identicle short straight lines.  If only 10 lines are used, it may not look much like a bicycle, but if 100 lines are used, then it will be unmistakeable.  Unlike sketching, in construction, balance is a factor, so for this reason, these blocks are a great tool for the developing engineering mind.  I think they will be used differently as the kids hit different stages of their childhood, to demonstrate more advanced skills of creative design.
1932735410|5.0|Overall a very good book. Helped a lot for passing the exam at first go without any hiccups.<br />Worth buying but seemed bit costly with so many material available online for free.
030758836X|2.0|This is a novel that is trying too hard to be creative, so much so that it was difficult to read ... sometimes it's best to simply tell the story.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />It's hard for me to pinpoint the exact word to describe this film, so I'll stick with disappointing. After a year of teaser trailers and posters perhaps the film reached an unreachable level of hype. Maybe The Dark Knight set the standards too high on what this series could be, either way the final film in the trilogy is a let down.<br /><br />From the start Christopher Nolan put himself in a tight situation by choosing Bane as the villain. There isn't much to Bane and Nolan's version doesn't add anything special. Top that off with a muzzle that makes some of his sentences impossible to understand and you're left with a very boring character who seems to contradict himself with what his main goal is. Considering what he had to work with Tom Hardy's performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't groundbreaking either.<br /><br />Next we have Ms. Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway. Out of everything I read leading up to this release it was this character that people were most worried about. Many felt like Hathaway didn't have what it takes to pull off a sassy character like Catwoman, I think it's safe to say that she proved them wrong. Not only did she give a hell of a performance, but she looked damn good in that outfit.<br /><br />Then you have the most unexpected performance out of the whole cast from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This man is making his mark in the film industry and deserves every ounce of fame he gets from it. I wasn't expecting his character to have such a major role in the film, but his character John Blake was really something else. In short he's the only cop with a brain among thousands of others who probably can't spell their own name. Which, in my eyes, is a good reflection of the law enforcement in the real world. For every good cop there's a thousand worthless one's.<br /><br />The problem with Rises is not the acting, but the story. \\"Batman Begins\\" set the standard on what a Batman movie shouldbe. Dark and gritty. Time and time again the Batman films tried too hard to be lighthearted and that's what stopped them from being great. Then they took everything that worked with Begins, improved it, and made \\"The Dark Knight\\". Every aspect of the film was improved on: the story, the villains, the plot twists, everything left you breathless. I can't tell you how many times I thought The Dark Knight ended only to be caught off guard by the excellent writing. That's all absent in this film.<br /><br />The thing is, instead of sticking with the formula that worked, they tried to go above and beyond that. That's why the story was so terrible, it was forced to try and replicate the complexity of The Dark Knight. They threw in plot twists alright, but they were all pointless. There was numerous times where I just found myself bored and I started looking around the room at random objects.<br /><br />They then proceed to add so many insignificant characters that I don't care about, and you shouldn't care about, and tried to make them into some complex piece of the story. Miranda Tate was, to put it bluntly, f***ing pointless. Realizing her insignificance they try to weave some deep story with her and Bane and it just winds up being a snore fest. Leaving us with an ending that felt forced because it was the last Batman film for Nolan. And don't even get me started on the Batwing... oops, I'm sorry, \\"The Bat.\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 6/10 - Had this been a standalone Batman title, I probably would've enjoyed it more. However, Nolan set standards for his Batman films, standards he wasn't able to meet. Having this be my most anticipated film of the year, only to be left with this... it saddens me. It's clear that Nolan was trying to top all the big sales that The Dark Knight reached, and it winds up being his downfall. A poor choice of a villain, and the small amount of screen time Batman actually received... I'm just at a loss for words at this point.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|My children really do like this one.  Not as appealing to adults as other animated films (but we are not the primary audience).  It always seems short compared to other animated tales, but very well made with a typical royal coup story (with fun talking animals to boot!).  A favorite of my children.  The soundtrack is good too.  A great addition to any kid's movie collection.
B0091IIP6S|4.0|I really like the security of it do not like the volume issues.  Over all a good investment to protect your device.
B005AUWY90|4.0|Has a &#34;oil companies are corrupt&#34; type of story to it, but if you don't mind that it is fun.  Not as good as the first one (but not very many sequels are).  This one is more about Mater than about Lightning McQueen compared to the first one.  The spy angel is certainly exciting.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy read. Took 2 days. Couldn't put it down. Erotic romance that had me simply reading for more! I'll be looking for more by this author!
B003H9M1QM|5.0|This movie never gets old.  Classic soundtrack.  Beautifully animated.  Takes me back to my youth every time I sit down to watch it with the kids.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This is a good game of 99¢ !  Only thing I can complain about the tiles and backgrounds.  Keeps telling me I get them, but have not found them or figured out how to change them.  With that being said, they probably need more help files...NOT about the game itself.....but how to navigate within it.
B004G6009U|5.0|Wonderful movie!  This one has it all.  Princess, evil witch, sword fights, love tail, humor, great soundtrack, and well thought out story line.  Beautiful animation too.  I only have little boys at home, and they ask to watch it again & again.  Perfect interpretation of a classic story.  Must have for a Kid's movie collection

B008L26QUC|5.0|Widely released on 12/3/76 and very much a Christmas film, the story of ROCKY occurs entirely during a holiday season. It begins on November 25th, with club boxer Rocky Balboa barely defeating a \\"tomato\\" named Spider Rico. Minus \\"expenses,\\" Rocky's winner's take is a poor day's wage.<br /><br />Holiday connections:<br />1.) There's an argument at Paulie's and Adrian's during Thanksgiving that ends with Paulie Pennino tossing the turkey Adrian prepared into the backyard. This leads to Balboa's first date with terminally shy Adrian: a memorable 10 minutes at an otherwise empty skating rink, then Adrian's tentative visit to Rocky's sad one-room apartment, and their first tender kiss.<br /><br />2.) Just before Christmas, a raging, drunken Paulie throws his sister out for good, and she moves in with Rocky, who's hard in training for the historic and epic Balboa/Creed bout, which takes place at the Philadelphia Spectrum on New Year's Day.<br /><br />ROCKY is in plain terms one of the greatest pictures ever made. For those who weren't there so long ago, you cannot imagine the emotional impact it had on theater audiences, all thanks to the melding of a beautiful love story, intense, skillfully photographed and edited fight scenes, plus perfect music. We were moved by the triumph of a perennial \\"loser\\" over the odds and his past; we cheered him wildly at story's end. Seeing nearly 30-year-old \\"spinster\\" Adrian and rudderless Rocky find each other, bond deeply and grow as people was and still is inspiring.<br /><br />By contrast, the only growth that Paulie experiences is the addition to his wardrobe of one garish blue sports jacket, paid for with part of the money he received for selling advertising space on Rocky's ring robe.<br /><br />At times a cartoonish caricature of Muhammad Ali, by the conclusion of their grueling 15 round battle, Apollo Creed seems a very real man, bloodied, exhausted and shaken to the core by the indomitable spirit and pulverizing left hand of his previously unknown opponent, Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />I watch ROCKY every holiday season, and always will. It's a story that never grows old.previously unknown opponent, Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />I watch ROCKY every holiday season, and always will. It's a story that never grows old.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I use Wunderlist mostly on my kindle fire. I'm not sure why people say it's useless on here. For me, it works perfectly. I have the 7&quot; Kindle Fire HD.  Once in a while, it will crash upon opening but not often and not enough for me to stop using it. As far as not having an Enter button goes, that never even crossed my mind. I just enter my text and press the + button next to it. I really like the look and feel of this app. To me, it stands high above the rest. I do think it needs a few more options, though. They don't give you a place to input a time for your tasks. They do, however, let you set a time for a reminder. This is just weird to me. Why would you need to be reminded by a certain time if the task didn't have to be completed by a certain time? When using this for appointments, I have to put the time of the appt in the notes section. Minor inconvenience but still. I'd also like a 12h time option. I don't like having to use the 24h format. One bad thing that only happens on occasion - sometimes the reminder doesn't work. Still not enough to stop using it.<br /><br />Bottom line, this app far exceeds the rest for me. I love it!  Looks great. Works great. Syncs perfectly. It could use a few more features. I'm looking forward to their new app and hoping that one will have what this one lacks.
B005CKIFM8|5.0|My experience with minor brand and DVD-R companies such as Desert Island Films has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are \\"best available source\\" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.<br />.<br /><br />In CARNIVAL OF SOULS, after surviving a terrible car accident, a young woman moves to Salt Lake City to take a job as a church organist. Frequent visions of a ghostly spectre eventually lead her to an abandoned pavillon's ballroom, where dancers straddle the line between the living and the dead, an eerie scene that brings with it self-realization of the girl's own fate.<br /><br />A remarkable first-and-only motion picture from industrial short director Herk Harvey (who also cameos as the undead man).

0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day was a great first person look at the raid that killed Osama Bin laden. I am really glad this book came out and while reading it I could not put it down. This is a must read for all Americans affected by the events of September 11, 2001. The author explains how he came to be on the Seal team that took part in the raid and explained other missions he was on during his tenure in the Navy. I highly recommend reading this book!

0385344333|1.0|I have read and enjoyed every Jack Reacher story prior to this.  I, like many others, could not wait to finally read another about my favorite character.  Although previously, I could not put down any Reacher book; I actually looked forward to putting this one down.  It was so boring and so pointless; that even though I had only 25 pages left I almost just stopped reading it.  Mr Child what happened?  Did you have someone else write this for you?  I am so disappointed with this book and now with Tom Cruise playing Reacher, a hulking blond, blue eyed man I may just have to give up any hope of enjoying another story of a character who used to be one of my favorites.

0321714113|2.0|Can we please have .epub's and .mobi's with the source-code examples rendered as normal fixed-width-font in the text, instead of having to click-through to rendered images of the same?<br />It takes a while for both my tablet and Kindle to find and render the image whenever I click-through (and I almost always want to) therefore forcing me to pause for it frequently!  Let alone how \\"clicking-through\\" on most Kindles can be a bit painful, anyway.<br /><br />This all-but ruins my reading enjoyment and assimilation of the information.

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Where to begin with this book. Started out with a bang.But was hard to finish , went off in three different stories , when we all know it is all about Pendegrast.Who cares about the rest. Why can they not go back to having him solve crimes which is what he does best, instead of this unbelieveable turn these last two books have taken.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story is truly an amazing blend of imagery in a stark reality of a dying world. The penmanship gives masterful illustrations that you can almost taste and most definitely feel if not touch.

630463949X|5.0|As a Fleetwood Mac fan from the 70's, I was a little nervous based on some reviews I'd read.  Maybe Stevie Nicks doesn't have the range she once had; however, the music sounded as good as it did before, and Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie haven't lost a note.  The smiles and looks and comraderie were also pretty exciting to experience.  Everyone appears older and wiser and comfortable with what they once were to each other, and accepting that it was in the past.  My only issue with this concert was that it was over much too soon.  A must-have for fans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose to read this book because many of my co-workers kept saying how good it was an how I HAD to read it. I'm not much of a reader, but when I seen the book on my grandmother's table (me having not read it yet) I finally gave in. And let's just say that I couldn't stop reading this book.

B003U0AHBO|5.0|I understand the reviewers were not kind to this movie.  I have to say for an action adventure movie it delivers.  The story of Robin Hood is actually and adequately written into to historical events.  Predictable, a bit, but we go to the movies to turn our minds off.  It a word, enjoyable.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Love this book so much I recommended it to a friend who told me he loved it as well. It's good to know given the ugly politics that seems to pervade our society for the 200+ years of our existence.

0547848412|5.0|Part of me feels like leaving a review on this book is pointless.  Its original heyday has long come and gone, and the renewed interest in this book due to the additional exposure the movie gives it means a whole slew of new reviews will come pouring in, and it feels that my review will only get lost among the many.  But I can't just pass this one by -- even though I read this book years ago and this review is sadly long overdue, I need to give it anyway.  And after being so disappointed by Martel's follow-up work \\"Beatrice and Virgil,\\" I want to remind myself why I fell in love with Martel's writing in the first place.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel is one of my favorite books of all time.  And given that most of the other books on my list of favorites seem to fall squarely into fantasy and science fiction (Dragonriders of Pern, Ready Player One, The Last Unicorn, The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland), that's no mean feat.  I don't remember what prompted me to read a book that's quite a ways out of my usual reading, but I am so glad I gave it a chance.<br /><br />In this book we meet Piscine Patel -- but he'd rather be called Pi, thank you very much -- the amiable son of a zookeeper in 1970s India.  Pi establishes himself as studious and devoutly religious, following no less than three different religions (Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam) and not living the active life of his brother.  The first quarter to third or so of the book seems to be almost a collection of essays about animals, religion, and comparisons between the two, and while one might argue that these sections are tedious and come across as the author using the novel as a soapbox, I find that they didn't detract from the story, and actually helped me identify more with Pi's mindset and the way he sees the world.<br /><br />The action picks up when Pi's father decides to sell the animals and move his family to Canada.  Sadly, tragedy strikes, and their ship sinks on the way across the Pacific.  Pi is the sole human survivor... but by some extraordinary twist of fate, he shares his lifeboat with a collection of zoo animals, including a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  Eventually the passengers are whittled down to Pi and the tiger, and Pi comes to realize that because he can't hope to fight the tiger, and there's no chance of escaping the tiger in the middle of the ocean, his survival hinges on learning to co-exist with Richard Parker.<br /><br />There are many who choose to see \\"Life of Pi\\" as a symbolic, philosophical work, and I do not fault them for that -- there are many levels on which any work, including this one, can be enjoyed.  But I chose to read this work not as a work of symbolism or philosophy, but as an adventure story.  And on that level, I find it succeeds greatly.<br /><br />Martel has an eye for detail and a knack for making even the most mundane of objects or actions seem fascinating.  And I found myself growing deeply attached to his characters, both Pi himself and his feline ship-mate.  I wanted to cheer for Pi whenever he came across good fortune, such as catching a fish or learning to hunt for sea turtles, and wanted to weep for him when he experienced the loss of his family or the crushing disappointment of missing a possible rescue.  And Richard Parker, despite being a constant danger, seemed rather likeable in his own way -- a unique ship-mate who gave Pi a reason for enduring and was an odd source of companionship.<br /><br />There are a few elements of this book that require some willing suspension of disbelief -- the encounter with a fellow castaway and the island Pi discovers both seem rather unlikely.  And the ending (I won't spoil it) irritated me just a little, as it seemed to want to \\"have it both ways\\" in regards to the story of Pi's survival.  But these didn't detract from my enjoyement from the novel, and the story of Pi and Richard Parker will stay with me always.  It's that powerful.<br /><br />Despite loving this book so much, I highly doubt I'm going to see the movie.  Books rarely translate well to the big screen, and I'm terrified that my favorite book ended up butchered in the transition.his book so much, I highly doubt I'm going to see the movie.

0062200909|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Chronicles: Art & Design already has a sequel volume planned for release in April 2013 - that one is said to focus on Characters and Creatures. I'm a little surprised to see that this companion series for the film trilogy dispenses with the familiar tradition of one-concept-art-book-per-film, but, it's also a welcome surprise given how much development these movies require from a creative standpoint.<br /><br />Along with the many enjoyments that others have mentioned are in this book, let me add that I was happy to find extra bits of art showcasing things I didn't see or notice from the movie - one good example is Old Took's party. Not sure if that scene was even put on film. Quite a bit of material here explores how the filmmakers developed the race of dwarves. The pay-off of so much exploratory art is onscreen, and in this book you see numerous examples of how early development photoshops of the cast and crew helped the artists develop the individuality of the race - lots of permutations on costuming, weapons, the over-sized hands, markings, facial hair, nose and brows. There's also a bunch of dwarven gals with beards; the inclusion reminds me of that funny scene from THE TWO TOWERS which left audiences wondering if we'd even recognize the dwarven women. Coverage is also given to Radaghast and the Goblins. Not so much material(surprisingly?) on certain other villains, but with the minor glimpses we caught of THEM, the only real absence I noted would be the lead orc hunter.<br /><br />This book definitely satisfied my expectations, and I will be interested in seeing how the next volume(s) round out the behind-the-scenes development of each film.

B009ZE27US|1.0|This doesn't work one bit.  It scanned me 8 times in a row and didn't give me the right age.  And it's not because I have youthful-looking thumbprints.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.
B00701897I|4.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat.....until it ended. Everything about it has been masterfully done but the end left a lot to be desired. I hope that they make a 2nd one so the adventures can continue.

B009HEN7LY|4.0|I am really upset that I didnt go see this in theaters.  Thanks to my Amazon Prime membership I just watched this movie three times.  It was great.  Nothing beats the original, and I would have loved to hear that Will Smith theme song once more but this definitely showed the depth of the characters and how it all truly began.  A must see for any MIB fan.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|This is one of my favorite LOST seasons. As I've noticed on all of the seasons, it has plenty of bonus features to enjoy, more than I normally would expect. Looks good, sounds good, and is very entertaining.<br /><br />But the feel of the series definitely changes here. I can't really explain it but the first 3 seasons had a certain feel to them that this one does not, it seems to have a different flow to it. The up side to this is that it moves faster than the first 3. The first 3 tended to drag on at times but this one moves a bit more quickly.<br /><br />GREAT series and overall a great buy!
B005SFR7YE|4.0|My only disappoinment was that I felt the voice of the Phantom should have been more sonorous & commanding - as it was, it seemed to me sort of pathetic. Also, I thought the ending went on far too long, it was \\"milked\\" far more than it should have been.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|This is easily one of my top 10 favorite movies. Mathew M. gave his absolute best performance in this film. He proved just how good of an actor he is and can be.

B0068FYZIO|5.0|AN excellent movie on multiple levels. It is very easy to looks past the fact that this movie is done in black and white seeing that the story is so powerful. A great job on this movie. They try not to sugar coat much, so it has nudity, blood, strong language,  and alot of violence, but this is all an attempt to capture the realism and the horror that was the holocaust.<br /><br /> Fantastic movie and a GREAT performance from Liam Neeson.
0553801473|2.0|Mr. Martin does not appear to have trouble writing thousands of pages, but has real trouble closing out a story.  I was very dissapointed with book 5.  The actual ending is abrupt and not really connected with the previous 5000 thousand pages ... oh sure, one can assume a Targaryen will rule.  Many plot lines are left dangling ... characters appear and dissappear ... never really connecting with the conclusion!  Very less than satisfying
0553805371|5.0|Book came brand new, absolutely perfect! Was everything and more than I expected.  Good hardcover, nice paper, easily visible text, a great buy, by a great author!

B009IQG5LK|3.0|In 1931, Chester Gould's \\"Dick Tracy\\" would be featured in the publications \\"Detroit Mirror\\" and distributed by the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate.  With its popularity, the comic strip would lead to a radio program that lasted from 1934 through 1948 and film adaptations in the 1930′s thanks to RKO.  By 1950-1951, a live action TV series was created and in the early '60s, an animated series was created.<br /><br />A story that revolves around a detective during the 1930′s in Chicago, Dick Tracy would catch his criminals using forensic science, high technology and intelligent wits, audiences were entertained by Dick Tracy's ability to chase down the criminal.<br /><br />But in 1990, the live action film was written and directed by Warren Beatty  (\\"Bonny & Clyde\\", \\"Reds\\", \\"Bulworth\\") would be released in theaters.  But the journey to make the live action film was a concept that Beatty head since 1975.  But as the plans for a live action films went through different creative hands and different perspectives of what kind of film would be made.  But in the end, for Warren Beatty, he wanted the live action film to pay homage to the comic strip and not deviate from that.<br /><br />And with Disney now having control of the film and working out a deal with Warren Beatty to write, direct and produce the film, \\"Dick Tracy\\" was officially made into a live action film.  The film would star Warren Beatty but also talent such as Al Pacino, Genne Headly, Madonna, Al Pacino, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin and Paul Sorvino.<br /><br />And would go on to earn over $162 million worldwide in the box office.<br /><br />And over 20-years-later, \\"Dick Tracy\\" will be released on Blu-ray in Dec. 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  While the film does look very good on Blu-ray and does feature a new digital restoration, what makes this 1990 film look very good is its artistic direction.  Warren Beatty wanted only seven colors to be used in the film in order to capture the original look of the comic strip.  So, red, green, blue and yellow and a few other colors are utilized.  Add in colorful outfits which look amazing with one another, such as Dick Tracy's yellow fedora and coat with the Kid's red hat and coat, the film evokes a style similar to German Expressionism, especially how buildings and the city are featured throughout the film.  Set design is fantastic and the limited colors made the film look much more artistic and beautiful.<br /><br />I didn't notice any artifacts, I did notice slight banding but for the most part, picture quality was good.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French 5.1 Dolby Digital along with Spanish language tracks.  There are scenes with action and machine gun shots, but primarily the film is dialogue and music driven.  The film score by Danny Elfman evokes a similar musical style that he used with his previous film \\"Batman\\".  So, while the musical score sounds great, as did Madonna's music which features lyrics written by acclaimed songwriter Stephen Sondheim.  So, dialogue and music are crystal clear and sound great via lossless compared to its older DVD counterpart.  It's important to note that \\"Dick Tracy\\" was the first film to use digital audio.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" comes with no special features.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Dick Tracy\\" comes with a slipcover case and a code for the digital copy of the feature film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I can easily remember \\"Dick Tracy\\" from my teenage years.  It was a film that was featured all over television because of the couple at the time, Warren Beatty and Madonna.  Plus, the major marketing that Disney put into the film.  Dick Tracy was all over television and while one side featured promotion for the film and its iconic character, there was a lot of promotion for Madonna starring in the film.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"Dick Tracy\\" was a fascinating film back when I saw it.  I saw the film as a unique artistic expression for Warren Beatty, as he wanted to keep the homage of the comic strip in his live-action film.  It was also a film that would feature Hollwood heavyweights Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman and for me, it was a bonus treat to have my favorite film composer at the time, Danny Elfman, scoring the music for the film and legendary writer Stephen Sondheim collaborating with Madonna on the songs for \\"Dick Tracy\\".<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Dick Tracy\\" because Warren Beatty was able to create world where the seedy underground and the characters that represent the crime infested area with a different look.  Humans were oddly shaped (ie. big heads or flat heads) or looked grotesque, among the criminals who looked like seedy criminals, there was a city that was featured with beautiful colors and its people sporting colorful outfits.  The limited colors made \\"Dick Tracy\\" look like art and so unique, I was quite pleased with set and costume design.<br /><br />And because the world of \\"Dick Tracy\\" looked different that reality and is based on a '30s comic strip, the film doesn't look like it was created in 1990, nor does the picture quality on Blu-ray make this film looked aged.  Picture quality was very good and to hear the music in lossless was also a major plus for this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Personally, I felt that Warren Beatty did a remarkable job with \\"Dick Tracy\\". It's original in presentation and for its time, the use of limited colors really distinguishes the film from others.  If there was any fault, unfortunately it would be the perception of the audience of its time.  1930′s heroes are not easy to promote for modern viewers.  Sure, heroes such as \\"Superman\\" or \\"Batman\\" can continue to be strong thanks to its continuing push as comic books, animated series, video games and via merchandise.  But with \\"Dick Tracy\\", \\"The Shadow\\" and even \\"The Green Hornet\\", these are heroes that emerged from comic strips and radio series that ended with those strips/radio series.  They are no longer featured as comic book stores, animated series or in store merchandise that unfortunately, these classic heroes have been forgotten.<br /><br />As I watched this film with my nine-year-old, he asked me questions of why Dick Tracy was popular since he had no special abilities.  And I would make the comparison to Sherlock Holmes, Dick Tracy was a wonderful detective.  But for children today, a hero in a film that saves people without special powers, is not too exciting for them.  While those of us who grew up earlier enough to have known about Dick Tracy, know how iconic that character was from the '30s through the '70s and once again, in the '90s thanks to Warren Beatty.<br /><br />But the biggest misconception that Disney of that era and Jeffrey Katzenberg had towards the film.  Katzenberg has reportedly said that they hoped that \\"Dick Tracy\\" would earn the same box office figures as \\"Batman\\".  Batman is a superhero and people are attracted to iconic superheroes and even to this day, many of those films do extremely well in the box office.  But while \\"Dick Tracy\\" was profitable, part of Katzenberg's disappointment was because the film was expensive to produce and market.<br /><br />But the film did well as a VHS and DVD release and now, this film is finally getting an HD treatment on Blu-ray.  The film looks wonderful, the lossless soundtrack is way better than any previous home video release but unfortunately, there are no special features included.<br /><br />So, while this Blu-ray release features the definitive version of \\"Dick Tracy\\" on home video, it's also a barebones Blu-ray release which in this day and age, is unacceptable.  Not even the theatrical trailer is included.  With so much work in trying to make this film so unique, there must be a featurette out there that could have been included on this Blu-ray release!  So, while \\"Dick Tracy\\" is a pretty enjoyable film, this Blu-ray release is a bit of a let-down when it comes to the lack of special features.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Dick Tracy\\" is a stylish, unique film that pays amazing homage to the original 1930′s detective.  Featuring a wonderful cast, amazing set and costume design and music, \\"Dick Tracy\\" may not be known to the younger generations of movie viewers, but this is one iconic hero who received the best film adaptation thanks to director, producer and actor Warren Beatty, who successfully  paid homage to the comic-strip.

B005LAII3U|4.0|From Len Wiseman (director of the \\"Underworld\\" films, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") comes a remake of the the 1990 film of the same name and based on the 1966 short story \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\" by Philip K.Dick.<br /><br />With the original 1990 film directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin becoming a box office success and receiving praise from film critics for its complexity as a sci-fi film, for its remake, the film was to be more of an adaptation of the original short story but instead became more of action film with beautiful, modern visual effects.<br /><br />The film made over $198 million in the box office during the summer of 2012 and now, will be released on Blu-ray which will include both the theatrical version and the extended director's cut.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Total Recall\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio) and while the film is primarily all visual effects and great use of green screen, on Blu-ray this film looks magnificent.  If anything, I guess the best word to describe the picture quality is \\"perfect\\".  Detail is amazing, the film looks natural, close-up shots are impressive and I'm just impressed of how awesome the environments look.  Black levels are nice and deep, no sign of banding, artifacts, aliasing or anything negative.  \\"Total Recall\\" looks magnificent in HD!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />And as one expects from a big budget film when it comes to picture quality, lossless audio doesn't disappoint at all.  Presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English Audio Description Track, the lossless soundtrack to \\"Total Recall\\" is immersive and an audiophile's dream.  With so much action featured in the film, directional audio of shootouts come from all over the soundscape and is truly immersive.  Ambiance of the city and crowds are also clear and the booms, crashes and bullets striking objects and the overall chaos that happens within the city, great LFE and great use of the surround channels!

Also, included is a slipcover case and both extended and director's cut versions of the film with an extra Blu-ray disc containing the special features.  Also, a video game demo for \\"God of War: Ascension\\" for the Sony PS3 is included.<br /><br />I'm quite aware of the criticism \\"Total Recall\\" had received, especially when compared to the 1990 film version.  But in someway, I give credit to Len Wiseman for taking on a sci-fi film which the original has its own cult following.  The question was how was he going to make things different.<br /><br />Giving credit to the 1990 Paul Verhoeven film, it was during a time when people were craving something new and unique.  Top films of the year were \\"Ghost\\", \\"Home Alone\\", \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and for sci-fi films, it was pretty much \\"Total Recall\\" and \\"Back to the Future III\\".  With \\"Total Recall\\", the film relied on plot, creativity and for its time, it was unique, humorous and imaginative.  People loved the originality with the film and for the 2012 film, aside from using modern visual effects, it's not going to be easy to create a better film, when the original film was so well-liked!<br /><br />My approach to this 2012 version was a film created for today's generation, using the latest in CG visual effects and creating a sci-fi world that would look even more fantastic and amazing than the original film.  And for the most part, I feel that Len Wiseman and crew did accomplish that.<br /><br />But one of the strong points of the original film was its plot and humor, this time around, \\"Total Recall\\" is more of a popcorn action film and it seems that for today's cinema, it's something that audiences continue to come out for and enjoy and move-on.  When I think about this film, the original 1990 film made you want to watch it again and over 20-years-later, I have watched the 1990 version of \\"Total Recall\\" on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray a good number of times.<br /><br />And with the original 1990 film, it maintained some semblance to the original short story that it takes place on Mars.  This new film, there is nothing about Mars at all, nor are their aliens.  The original was darker, bloodier but that's what makes the 1990 version a sci-fi classic.  The 2012 version doesn't try to be anything like the original, it doesn't want to be an exact remake and I like that.  I tend to dislike remakes of older films but if they can maintain some semblance to the original but yet be something different, I'm all for it.<br /><br />We have seen remakes or reboots with films such as \\"Hulk\\", \\"Spider-Man\\",  \\"Superman\\", \\"Karate Kid\\" and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />But with \\"Total Recall\\", the original was a sci-fi film was dark comedy elements, this 2012 version is a visual effects-driven, popcorn action sci-fi film.  In my opinion, two different types of films.<br /><br />And for those who feel that the 2012 version was dumbed down to be too action-driven, well, if you followed Len Wiseman's films, as a director or producer, the \\"Underworld\\" films have been like that and even his earlier film \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" has been like that.  The fact is that Wiseman is a director who was hired to take on this film because of his experience in action-films.  And for today's audiences who are exposed to video games that tend to be more eye candy and short on plot, a lot of action films seem to be that way and today's audiences are digging it.<br /><br />Personally, with director Len Wiseman and the casting of Colin Farrell, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale, I pretty much expected an action film and nothing to deep or thought-provoking.  So, I came out watching this film with no negative feelings, whatsoever.  I got what I expected and maybe even more with the stunning beautiful visual effects and the outstanding picture quality and lossless audio on Blu-ray.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this 2012 Blu-ray release is that you get both the theatrical and extended director's cut edition.  And for those who really want to get into the mindset of the challenges that Len Wiseman faced as a director, the audio commentary included with this Blu-ray release is worth listening to!  In fact, there are a good number of special features included on this Blu-ray release, although a good number of them are quite short.<br /><br />Regardless, there's nothing to be angry or spiteful to this film because the original 1990 version is out on Blu-ray.  I look at this as a film tailored to today's audiences who want more action, more visual effects. And that's what the audience is getting.  So, if you enjoyed the original, there is a Blu-ray release for the Paul Verhoeven film available.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut\\" is one of the most beautiful looking sci-fi films on Blu-ray in 2012, looks great, sounds magnificent and a good number of special features are included.  But for anyone looking for something deep or thought-provoking, this is not that type of film.  This is a film for those who love popcorn action films and beautiful sci-fi visual effects.  And if you are that type of viewer, then \\"Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut\\" is a Blu-ray release that I can easily recommend to you!lm.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Great condition and love this movie. My daughter was excited to watch this classic movie. I'm glad I can share it with her.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|For over a decade, action/thriller spy fans have been entertained by Robert Ludlum's \\"Bourne\\" series.<br /><br />Featuring a film adaptation of the trilogy (\\"The Bourne Identity\\", 2002; \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", 2004; and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", 2007) by Tony Gilroy (who co-wrote each film), it was thought by many that \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" would be the final film in the series.<br /><br />Of course, the Bourne films were a tremendous success but by 2008, a fourth film was being planned.  But with Paul Greengrass (who directed the second and third \\"Bourne\\" film)  not returning as a director, actor Matt Damon said he would not do another Bourne film.<br /><br />But Tony Gilroy along with his brother Dan Gilroy would begin working on writing a fourth film that didn't include Jason Bourne titled \\"The Bourne Legacy\\".  Not wanting to re-create a Bond series with a different actor, he would only work ona fourth film if none of the original cast or filmmakers were involved.  And with the events of \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\", it would lead to \\"Bourne Legacy\\" post-Bourne.<br /><br />The film which was budgeted around $125 million would go on to earn over $276 million in the box office and now will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in Dec. 2012 courtesy of Universal Studios Home Entertainment.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and while watching this film, I was pleased with the clarity and detail.  Wonderful contrast and I detected no aliasing, no banding or artifacts.  No problems with the picture quality whatsoever.  Videophiles will be pleased with the overall picture quality especially the cinematography courtesy of Robert Elswit (Magnolia\\", \\"Michael Clayton\\", \\"Syriana\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood\\").<br /><br />Thanks to the many gorgeous location shots and great coverage of the action sequences, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is a film that looks amazing on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, DTS Digital Surround 5.1, DVS 2.0 and Espanol, Francais DTS Digital Surround 5.1.  \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is a film that features plent of action and as one can imagine from a big budget action film, this film is absolutely immersive on Blu-ray.  From Aaron in the the frozen area of Alaska, the sounds of a missile being shot and a cabin being blown up, wolves growling from the distance, gun shots being pumped, a motorcycle chase-scene, a laboratory being riddled with gun shots and the ambiance of crowd scenes galore, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" sounds amazing on Blu-ray, great use of surrounds for panning and directional audio and also LFE for explosions.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, Espanol and Francais.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Deleted Scenes - (6:48) Featuring three deleted scenes with optional audio commentary with Director/co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy and director of photography Robert Elswit<br />  Re-Bourne - (6:11) A featurette about the challenge of continuing the Bourne series without Jason Bourne.<br />  Enter Aaron Cross - (7:11) A featurette with Jeremy Renner about playing the lead role of Aaron Cross.<br />  Crossing Continents - (8:22) A featurette on the various locations where \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" was shot.<br />  Man Vs. Wolf - (4:36) A featurette on creating the Aaron Cross vs. Wolves fight scenes and what was real and what was animatronic.<br />  Wolf Sequence Test - (1:39) The animated storyboard for the wolf attack scene.<br />  Moving Targets - (6:11) A featurette featuring the cast and crew discussing the focus on the characters of Aaron Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing.<br />  Capturing Chaos: The Motorbike Chase - (7:49) A featurette on the filming of the motorcycle chase scene.<br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with Director/co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy, editor John Gilroy, director of photography Robert Elswit, second unit director Dan Bradley and production designer Kevin Thompson.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" comes with the Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and UltraViolet version of the film.  Also included is a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I have to admit that prior to the theatrical release of \\"The Bourne Legacy\\", I was skeptical of a film based on the Bourne Series but yet doesn't feature Jason Bourne as the primary character.  I asked myself of how would Tony and Dan Gilroy create a story without its lead character, which many of us have enjoyed!  And one can only wonder if Tony Gilroy was going to follow a similar 007 style of storyline with its treatment of the character but with a different actor.<br /><br />Thankfully this was not the case with \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" as the Gilroy brothers really planned this film out with future potential in mind.  Consider it a storyline within the world of the Bourne series, it's storyline of hidden government black ops groups, testing of soldiers using chemical pills but then the secret side of government who wants to hide any lead to this secret black ops groups by trying to eliminate those who were involved.<br /><br />Enter Aaron Cross, a member of the black ops group, Operation Outcome, one of the many operatives that is to be killed, so no traces of Operation Outcome can be discovered during the investigations of Operations Treadstone and Blackbriar.<br /><br />But due to his enhanced thinking and ability due to the pills he had been taking as part of Operation Outcome, he manages to thwart his death, but letting the retired Col. Eric Byer, USAF and his staff think that he's dead.<br /><br />For those who thought about comparing actor Jeremy Renner to Matt Damon in this action-role, the first half hour literally makes you forget Damon as Renner is able to show that he can do action scenes.  And it helps that his popularity as Hawkeye in the summer blockbuster \\"The Avengers\\" showed that he's more than capable of taking on the role as the primary operative and protagonist.<br /><br />With two talented actors with Renner and Edward Norton as the antagonist, the film is strengthened by its female lead, Rachel Weisz.  Playing a geneticist, Dr. Marta Shearing, fortunately this is not your banal sexpot, short-fling character.  She's a smart intelligent woman that has been pulled into danger as she is also targeted for death and now the character along with Aaron Cross are doing all they can to survive and run.<br /><br />The film not only features very good acting but also exciting action sequences.  And the cinematography to cover the fast action was exciting to see.  Robert Elswit may be known for films such a \\"Magnolia\\", \\"Michael Clayton\\", \\"Syriana\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood\\" but when it comes to action films such as \\"Mission Impossible: The Ghost Protocol\\" and \\"Salt\\", he is a cinematographer with a great eye when it comes to action films.  And so far this is one of his best best films yet.  Thanks to the many gorgeous location shots, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is a film that does look quite amazing!<br /><br />But what about the film's faults?  The primary fault that I found with \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is not setting up of what happened in the previous three films.  For those who haven't watched the trilogy, and those who have and have not seen it in several years, will probably not remember Pam Landy's character and what took place between Jason Bourne and the CIA Deputy Director and what the CIA was secretly doing.  I suspect many viewers will be lost of what is going on and just setting up of what took place in three films, and getting people up to speed.<br /><br />Also, what made the Bourne films so exciting is its plot.  While \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is well-acted, I felt there was too much action over substance, too much of the cat and mouse game than delving deeply into the characters which was done in the previous three films.<br /><br />Still a film that will have tremendous potential but I rather see more of the deep intelligent plot co-existing with the action, than the film being all about the action.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, videophiles and audiophiles will absolutely enjoy the presentation of \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" on Blu-ray. The video is well-detailed, amazing clarity and picture quality features no blemishes or anything problematic.  The lossless audio because of the intense action is immersive and impressive!  And there are a good number of special features included as well.  Also, the additional extra of having a DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet version is a plus.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" shows promise of being something greater for future sequels.  The first film featured good acting, clever and intelligent writing and amazing action sequences and cinematography (and also music).  But its action sequences eclipses its plot quite a bit.  Still, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is an awesome Blu-ray release and fans of the Bourne series will surely enjoy this film in HD.

0123694965|5.0|This book summarizes a few years of thinking about design, lenses, and cross-curricular perspectives.  I had been fortunate enough to stumble on many of the ideas presented in this book on my own, but often lacked a clear vocabulary for what I experienced and never was able to collect it all into one place.  Jesse took all of this, added MUCH more to it, bottled in up in a very concise book, and organized it in an easy-to-navigate manner.  I was an engineering student and am now a high school math teacher.  I reference this book often as a guide to thinking about thinking and designing learning experiences for my students.  You couldn't pry this book from my dying fingers.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|I love this series.  I have each of the first three movies; now this one.  Can't wait for the latest release to come out Dec. 21, 2012.
0545265355|5.0|I'm going to presume that if you are here you are familiar with the Hunger Games books and want to know if the box set is better than buying the books individually. Depending on how you feel about the difference in price, I would say this boxed set is a nice splurge. As someone who grew up with Laura Ingalls Wilder and Anne of Green Gables box sets, I think that having a contained storage place for your favorite books makes them a great treasure and more dear than lining up individual books on your shelf. Box sets also make it possible to display the books on a top shelf without the use of a bookend which means more storage for avid book lovers.<br /><br />The actual box has the illustration shown in the picture but has a sheen that is a nice mix between a matte and glossy finish. It isn't as shiny and reflective as a glossy but it isn't as dull as it is appears in the picture. The book covers offer a nice, colorful contrast to the black case and feature the distinctive Hunger Games artwork. These books have some of the best cover art design that is appeared on the teen market in years, so, all and all, this is a very attractive package.
B00068TJM6|5.0|My wife bought this for me five years ago.  I want to say that I have used this watch for dressy occasions and for ocean adventures and hunting.  It's tough, it's waterproof, it's functional, it has lasted without flaw or problem.  It's extremely accurate (I also have several atomic watches to compare it to) and the price for the quality is just stunning.<br /><br />After five years, I would never have thought it would have taken this much abuse and still look and perform so well.  Money well spent.

B008D28HYS|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Just can't put it down, once I get started. Played other games like this one on my Tablet before, but they never match up to the quality, details and controls that \\"CrossMe\\" delivers. The Designers put a lot of work into each puzzle. Some customers have stated that puzzles are to easy. For they start out that way, and you work your way up from Beginners to Expert.<br />With the hours and hours of relaxed challenging puzzles I've enjoyed it's been well worth the $5 price tag. Another nice little carrot the developers give you from time to time are new puzzles. Continually adding more game for your buck. Try the few puzzles on the free version, then if you enjoy it. Buy the big set.
1250010489|5.0|This book is so tight in plot, so complex in plot, very strong in dialogue, that I could have read the book straight through. It is remarkable that the author is a world authority on the inner workings of the Microsoft operating system. I heard him being interviewed by Steve Gibson (Spinrite fame) and Leo Laport (The Tech Guy) and it was interesting to listen to Mark describe how he works in two worlds, Microsoft and being an author of books like this. (I have read his Zero Day also).<br /><br />In case anyone thinks that what Mark is talking about in the beginning of this novel about malware in the electric grid of the U.S. is far-fetched there are current articles about this subject in Power Magazine. This magazine specializes in power, nuclear, wind, solar plants around the world.<br /><br />Trojan Horse is a great novel.
1567184855|5.0|WOW, is all i can really say about this book. I have never read a whole book where every page was interesting. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I think this book was made for a reason, and i am so lucky to be able to be one of the chosen ones to come across this book with beautiful details and important details and information.<br /><br />It makes you understand why you have felt like you have met someone before but never remember where. It makes you understand why you love certain people in your life so very much. Because they were once  either your soul mate or child.

B005LAII8K|4.0|review made on the blu ray version of the movie-<br />movie - 3.5 /5<br />video - 4 /5<br />audio - 5 /5<br /><br />somehow, i didn't enjoy looper as i should have, don't know why, i just didn't.<br />video was good, with some scenes slightly soft, maybe a director's choice, but the audio rocked.<br />another bruce willis action flick.<br />get it if you must.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Hey it's the old school alien movies all in one big bundle set! It's a great deal if you can get it on sale like me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun!  Love that you can trade prizes for more coins.  I hate to let anyone else play!  Not even my husband!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Huey Lewis is hot.  And this CD is hot.  He is one of the best singers of the eighties and the music is HOT!
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is the start of the new series, the acting and story are better than the original movie. This flows into the next movie just like the books did.
B0000024YL|5.0|What can you say about Simon and Garfunkel that hasn't already been siad.  Great song writing and great harmony.  And these ARE their greatest hits.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the game is a timesink and if you aren't careful will eat your bank account.... but holy crap it's ponies... whenever I want them! plus Derpy!!
B004MPESSY|2.0|Spoilers.....<br /><br />I never saw the original but I was actually surprised at how little I liked this movie. For all the people complaining about how the rape scene was too brutal or whatever, you read the movie description before watching it right? Well then no complaints because you know what it's about. Woman gets raped and near murdered by a bunch of hillbillies. She then gets her revenge. This is what got me. She went off to be alone in the woods and goes for jogs in her bra and short shorts. There is nothing really that seems special about her, she kind of just seems like a typical college girl. She doesn't seem especially smart or gifted and doesn't think to bring a gun on her lonely journey. Yet she is able to get away from a bunch of grown men and then survive off the land for a month without being found. She then goes on to pick them off in a very creative fashion one by one. Really? I mean this girl has no background that would make you think she could pull this off. I found it very unbelievable and thought it was disappointing. The rape scene isn't enjoyable for sure but I didn't feel like it was the whole movie like some reviewers mentioned. Maybe I was just irritated you don't see much of her or how she is getting by and then suddenly a month later she is acting like an assassin.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|You get so much in this set of 6 discs. Excellent value for the price. Look no further. The last disc only has highlights & behind the scenes - but 5 discs of shows is still hours of entertainment. No complaints from my Dr. Who fans.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|If you r a T.I.fan and like his family oriented reality show, like me, & like his previous albums, you should love this album.  Almost every track is banging.  There are many standout tracks on the album detailing his life & recently, his troubles.  I am not going to go over every track like many, as you can sample each track before buying, I will just say this album is in my top 5 of the year hip hop albums.  T.I. has a flow that is really appealing to me, so I highly recommend this.
B003XHLIUS|5.0|My son was very impressed with this figure. He couldn't get over all the fine details. And it is quite large for an action figure. This would not be good for small kids but for older who appreciate the workmanship or for collectors.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I don't know what was so exciting about this movie. I heard all the great reviews. I kinda wanted to go to sleep in the middle of it.
0345803507|5.0|Great story.  I can't wait until they do a movie for this.  Definitely have to be open-minded to appreciate it.
B0019K06WM|5.0|After years of not taking CSNY serious, I am glad I bought this CD to experience Nash and Crosby at their finest.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|I started watching Damages when the first season came out and it is an awsome show,  and Glenn Close is amazing as always so if you want to see some great acting check out All of the Damages season.  Now i am waiting on the final season and my set will be complete.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|I love the Starship Troopers franchise.  So when I saw this movie I knew I had to have it.  The animation is fantastic and the story is fun and involving.  In my opinion it is the best one since the original and a must have for any fan of the series.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves the \\"diary\\" books. And I won't lie, I read them myself! This was just as good as any. Happy reading!
1451695195|3.0|While there was really no &#34;proof&#34; This mans journey was enlightening and thought provoking. It was proof enough for him and thats what it's all about.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Not.  only is the artwork charming and whimsical, but the music and sound effects create a dreamlike quality that perfectly matches the game.  While I am only to dream level 5 I can tell already that each level will progressively challenge and entertain.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great action, pacing and effects. Story is well written. You should watch other movies for best satisfaction out of the series.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a definite good pick for my home video library.<br />It's good for all ages, young and old alike!
B005ZUR724|4.0|great app! grafpics are low but still fun to be in guilds, teams, and dungeons. although there are lots of<br />glitches throughout the game but is still a great app so if your looking for a good time buy it!
B0091LS07E|5.0|This girl is on fire. Definitely not a disappointment. What talent Alicia posseses.  She is an amazing artist and this album is wonderfu.
B004BSFC46|3.0|Only three stars....a bit flimsy.....and not interesting for infants.  Takes a bit of effort to get it on infant's flailing arms and get the bug on top.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I'm addicted to the Ice Age movies and this one didn't let me down.  I just love watching the adventures of the &#34;pack&#34;. What a family adventure!!!
4898153194|5.0|I got two copies for gifts and I'm not sorry. It is quite lovely. At the price I imagined more pages and larger ones, which is on me because it clearly lists the weight, number of pages, length, and width. I think it is a bit over twice the Japan price. If you wait there may be an English edition in a larger format at a lower price (or not.) Knowing then what I know now I still would have purchased it, it is perfect for the recipients.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is an awesome movie.  Was great watching it in 3D.  Keep bringing out more Movies in 3D.  They are alot of fun to watch.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Open kindle readernfor android for the second time ever qnd it crashes my android tablet. Try several times , even do a hard reset and to no avail. The app can not be used. So if an app is unusable and crashes the whole system after one day of use, I don't think it deserves even 1star. I'm foing to try and reinstall and see what happens. But ar the moment I'm not impressed in the least. This hurts amazon's brand immensely for me, as I didn't even consider another reader or another place to purchase ebooks until now, as I searc I'm sure I'll be in for other surprises. I.e. I wonder if I can read my ebooks from amazon on anpther reader.<br /><br />It appears I can't submit without selecting at least one star...
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I love this movie and seeing it in 3D was wonderful.  Thanks for finally getting this movie to the public in 3D.
1469220660|5.0|I read the book already on my nook, but bought this as a gift for my mom.  I enjoyed reading the series so far.
B001L51RQE|5.0|I bought this for my brother as a gift. He said it is AWESOME!<br />He saw them in Hershey when they toured.
B0041KXUGQ|1.0|This DVD was Italian. You have to select English. I bought it for a 7 year old. No where on the site did it say it was not an English version. Now it will cost more to return it than to just keep it to give away. Italian anybody?
B001AQO3QA|5.0|As soon as I saw this collection on blu ray I had to get it. When I started to watch them ,they blew me away! The picture and sound are tremendous!!!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Yes the Blu-Ray DVDs are working &#34;Like New&#34;, but since I am giving this as a gift I wanted the box and case to look &#34;Like New&#34; they had marks/scuffs on the edges and was marked up a bit. Other then that the CDs were fine.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult really knows how to make a jaw dropping novel. It's impossible to put her books down. Perfection in a novel.
0385335997|5.0|This is an awesome book.  It has history, love, romance, family, and so much more!  Every nurse should read these books.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|It's a great game, a good time waster very fun, but, it's a money hog! It makes it so tempting to WASTE MONEY!  For example, one thing you can by (with real money) costs $100!!! The cheapest thing is $2, THE CHEAPEST!!!!!!! It makes me mad. But again it's still fun, animations are great, animals are cool and fun, I love the whole layout of the game.  So, should you buy it? It's free, so why not?  LOL.  &quot;In God we trust&quot; &quot;don't tread on me&quot;
0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author and her Outlander Series draw the reader in like few books are able to.  The story is riveting, exciting, and heart rending at times.  I would read the whole series again!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|What more can I say?  A breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre.  Awaiting the sequel and occasionally lurking on the author's blog for news.
B004XWLN20|4.0|smallville is the best tv show i have seen yet snd its worth what i paid yes, the disc are a bit hard to get out but really thats the only thing over all am happy with what i got.
0525953728|4.0|Mark Owen's \\"No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden\\" is an excellent account of the SEAL mission into Pakistan that killed Osama Bin Laden.  Mark Owen is the pseudonym of a Navy SEAL who took part in the raid.<br /><br />The first part of the book tells the story of the author's enlistment into the Navy, selection for SEAL, and then selection and qualification for SEAL Team Six.  The author then describes a handful of his missions, including some missions in Iraq, and the life of SEALs deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.  While interesting, there is nothing new or enlightening that cannot be found in many other books on the SEALs.<br /><br />Then the author describes their training for the big raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound, including how he almost wasn't selected to go on the big mission and how they trained relentlessly but didn't know their actual target.  Finally, his description of the raid itself is excellent, including the crashing helicopter that endangered the mission and the way they overcame the unexpected problems on the mission.<br /><br />Of course, writing about classified missions and the tactics, techniques, and procedures about the SEALs, the author said that he intentionally left out details that could compromise future missions.  That leaves the reader always wondering if you're getting the real story.  But in the end, the story that we do get is well worth reading.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Had heard a few of the songs from the CD on the radio and really enjoyed them, so I bought the CD.  What a wonderful way to celebrate the Holidays.  Every song is a winner and will definitely put you in the Holiday Spirit.  What a wonderful addition to my Holiday collection.
0307474259|4.0|Gary Taubes's \\"Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It\\" is an excellent, simple, readable explanation of why the current conventional wisdom about weight and calories is wrong - and how it got there.  Very simply, Taubes describes how foods high in carbohydrates, especially complex carbohydrates, cause us to gain weight by releasing insulin and causing the accumulation of fat cells.<br /><br />This isn't new information.  Taubes collects the research and information that has already been around for over one hundred years but explains how it is ignored by modern science and the government. This explains why obesity is on the rise despite all of our society's efforts to curb it.<br /><br />This isn't a diet book, but it does explain the science behind the low-carb diets (like Atkins).  After reading this book and being convinced by the science in it, I easily lost 25 pounds and feel great.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I didn't make it past the first 30 minutes, it felt like I knew the story too well, as if I had seen it before, many times.
B0086700CM|5.0|very addicting, just have to sit and play until I've completed a level or if I fail to complete jump I have to sit and play until I do. psychology of the game addict. lot's of fun.
B005IGDW24|5.0|For old Smurf fans this is enjoy and because there is so much CG the 3-D is better that many of these type of films.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|loved the movie, it was funny, and entertaining,  nice animation, great colour,  kept me interested  very worth it  will pass it on to my nephew
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|This is an ecco film so it is preachy but there are some river sceens that are great 3-D and one thats even intense it makes a good demo.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Saw this and read the reviews. Quick download and install on my kindle fire. One reviewer complained no access to gallery and another suggested a work around. I think there has been an update as I had no problems loading photos from my gallery. Now I just have to figure. out all the many controls and settings. Appears to bra great app.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|This app only locks my phone, i can't continue to shop on my phone....it usef to be so easy now, impossible.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves this app. A bit challenging for him to do some parts because it requires you to assemble &#34;carts&#34; to play appropriately.
B005DI66N4|1.0|Was it the initial story of Rawicz interrogation that sucked me in?<br />If a man could suffer that and not be broken it leads you to believe he could have survived almost anything.<br /><br />I have considered myself an observant reader and have picked up on inconsistencies in other stories that don't add up such as Yossi Ginsbergs \\"Jungle\\" for one example.<br /><br />Perhaps because it was told through a journalist who more or less said he stumbled on to Rawicz's survival story while on assignment for the London Daily Mail to interview a Polish man who was said to have seen a Yeti.<br /><br />So when you read in the forward by Ronald Downing that Rawicz had not sought him out to tell his Ripping Yarn but the reverse it tends to give even more impetus to believing it to be true. This I think lead me into not scrutinizing what followed as closely as I otherwise would.<br /><br />The fact that this was not just one amazing survival story but several wrapped into one should have made me take notice along with the other improbabilities.<br /><br />The interrogations, the long trip east to Camp 303 in north eastern Siberia (initially three thousand freezing miles packed in a cattle train with hundreds of other prisoners and then the extra fifteen hundred chained together on foot heading further north towards the Arctic Circle in freezing temperatures) , the risk that would have to be taken to make his escapee, the epic four or more thousand miles south walk to through Mongolia, the barren life claiming Gobi desert (a particular hell on earth) through Tibet and finally India. Freezing cold, unbearable heat, the worst of conditions, the likelihood that the camp commandants wife would have aided an escape, the coincidences of food or water relief just when all seems lost.<br /><br />As reviewer Mr Scrubbins say's the list goes on and the whole story's been debunked after further research. No surviving companions to collaborate any truth whatsoever so we are left to wonderif the journalist and Rawicz put their heads together to compose a best seller.<br /><br />As I was with Ginsberg's book I'm incensed when I become aware that I have read a work of fiction being passed off as fact. That's fraud as far as I'm concerned so why is this book still being published and promoted as a true story I would ask.<br /><br />I had initially written a favourable review but since having discovered it was a false account I withdrew it.<br /><br />I'll certainly check out the more critical and adverse other reviews in the future and I would advise others to do the same before wasting their money.<br /><br />That is unless you prefer fiction.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|my son loves this. He is addicted to all the angry bird apps and this seems to be one of his favorites.
B000FCK42M|4.0|there is a lot going on in this book but Winslow weaves it all together masterfully. I ordered this after reading Savages and The Kings of Cool because i wanted to see what else Winslow had to offer. Its obvious that this guy has done his homework on the drug trade and the cartels in Mexico. I buy books to read while im on the elliptical at the gym to make the time go by faster, and on many occasions my time would be up and i'd still be standing there motionless on the machine while i kept reading because its tough to tear yourself away. i'd definitely recommend it.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|While this sequel is certainly entertaining and worth watching, I think the first one was better. I wasn't a fan of the slow-motion sequences.
B00846REIS|3.0|While the book was entertaining, i felt like it too closely mirrored the more popular 50 Shades of Gray. I think that 50 shades was probably a bit kinkier, but still the stories were very similar. If you're looking for one of this author's more &#34;adult&#34; books, this isn't really very graphic but its a fun and easy read so i gave it 3 stars.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|This was by far one of the most touching movies I've ever watched. It was so intimate and worth every cent. I'm normally into way more hard core m/m movies but this topped any of them. I absolutely loved it!!
B000VYX8PE|4.0|its true that you keep hoping for the kids to catch a break, because that's usually the way it goes, but they don't. this is an easy book to read and kids may enjoy it. my only problem with it was that it all of a sudden is over, and its really short. I could have realized that before buying it if only i'd looked at the length. but overall i enjoyed it, and i'd recommend it to pull you out of the normal storyline comfort zone.
B0014DCT74|5.0|Sorry to compare, but this is the sound that made The Cure incredible.  It's melodically raw, powerful and emotional.  One of my favorite albums of all time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Needed the product as mine had fizzled.  Product was as advertised - delivered in time indicated. So glad to be able to get replacement parts when needed!  Thanks!
B00006AW2L|5.0|One of the best records by The Rolling Stones ever. All the songs are fantastic, but &#34;Paint it black&#34; and &#34;Under my thumb&#34; are my favourite ones. &#34;Lady Jane&#34; and &#34;High and dry&#34; are other masterpieces where Jagger shows his best version and the rest of the album can´t be missed, either. It is also remarkable the collaboration of the late Brian Jones, an excellent musician and one of the pillars of the Stones at that time. A pity that &#34;Aftermath&#34; was a bit shadowed by the release of &#34;Revolver&#34; by the Beatles on similar dates. Anyway, a great record to discover and enjoy the Rolling Stones.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This app only allows for short turm play. I made it through the first level but when I lost a man on the second level it said I had to buy the full version to continue playing. This game is old and dated and not worth spending good money on. I don't recommend.
1400049628|5.0|Awesome book. Written as if a zombie apocolypse could break out at any second. Very funny.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you like romance and thrillers all in one then read this book! I love the story and the ending was great. Best book I've read in a while and I can't wait to see the movie.
4898153194|5.0|This was a gift to my daughter. It arrived earlier than expected in this busy christmas time. Thanks. Looking forward to order next time.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|He is just too cute, he dances and sings.  He'll be a great addition to anyone's 80s collectables!  Enjoy him!
B000F8O35U|5.0|exactly what i was looking for!!!  Awesome to be able to find since it has been out of print for a few years
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This seemed boring till the middle of the book. Unlike the others I fought to finish it. But it's worth it when finished.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The kides loved the movie.  I think it is great to have a female character that is not the regular princess we have have all grown to knowl.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Could not wait to check this out.  Movie is good and the price was about average.  Arrived in no time and was in perfect condition.  Good movie for all Stargate fans.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest
0143122010|5.0|A compelling and comprehensive view of the role of violence through history and the implications on human culture and its creation.
B008MM9630|5.0|great fun! great colors and animation. i only wish things did not die when you can't play for a while!
0345803485|4.0|I liked this book okay although the subject matter really wasn't to my taste.  I don't plan to read the next 2 books as one was enough for me.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I have been a fan of James Taylor for ummmm, forty+ years now.  He has never once disappointed me yet, and this CD is no exception. It is classic James Taylor. Straight forward and easy, a little bluesy, and some fun banter on the duet with Natalie Cole. Everything your used to getting in a James Taylor performance. I listen to it constantly in the car- haven't removed it since I inserted it. Buy it and sit back with a glass of wine!
0763650420|5.0|We bought this for our 5 year old son and he adores it! It's one of his favorite books !
B00003CXCT|4.0|Although not the highest quality due to it being used, every DVD was unscratched and picture quality was good. If you are a Star Wars fan, this was a great deal.
B008S6B41C|5.0|This is ADK1972, I Just Received My 5 Disc Box Set Of Deep Purple's Machine Head, 40th Anniversary Edition! I Previously Owned Their 2CD, 25th Anniversary Edition & Enjoyed it, So I didn't have Any Problems buying This Title, It's Like Wine It gets better with Age & Still Sounds Excellent infact better Than The 1997 Release!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I got Casual Vacancy from the Library today.  Thankful I did not buy it.  It goes back to the Library tomorrow.  It is boring, lifeless, depressing without any let up or purpose; no powerful characters;  nothing to like or relate to.<br />Do not bother to read this book.
0061122416|5.0|The book arrived in great condition from seattlegoodwill and I love this story.  Very easy to read with a whole magical chest of insightful &#34;self help&#34; gems.  We are very powerful beings if we would just shed the idea that we have to &#34;be&#34; a certain place to achieve our greatness. A must read!
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice - Great movie and Colin Ferth is the best!  Well done and pleased with the movie vs book.
B00008WT5J|5.0|I wanted this CD and since it was not a new release I knew it might be hard to fine in town.  It arrived quickly and the price was good.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Such a heroic tale - it was very hard to get through the details of the assaults without personal nightmares and tears... but you could almost FEEL the healing as she spoke her story.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This story was well-written, and well-thought. I loved the pace, the characters, and idea behind the writing.<br /><br />I'd have paid for this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was awful.  Just awful - wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it.  No creativity or anything.  Terribly unbelievable story, I couldnt even get past the 1st 1/3 of the story.  Not because I cant handle the material - I like romance novels and a sex scene doesnt turn me away... but come on!!  This is like reading the script of an amatuer porn video where the actors have 3 standard lines that they repeat over and over in each schene.  Did someone order a pizza?  Que the bad music and all of a sudden the 1/2 naked pizza guy and girl wrapped in a towel that answered the door are getting it on in the doorway.... ugh.  It was awful - dont waste your money.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|get it. it's all 3 Godfathers and it's not that expensive. really good movies for the price of just one.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|What an AWESOME follow up to Something Borrowed - I loved this story.  Cant get enough of Emily Griffin.  Already filled my Kindle with more in this series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First time reading in a while and I'm glad I chose this book. I couldn't put it down, just breath taking!
B000G6R7B8|4.0|Love the watch but the band may be a small issue,  Band is not canvas, but nylon is fine,  The band is canvas color, a light tan. There is a leather? reinforcement for the adjustment holes that is a little on the wimpy side and 9 will get you 10 it will die prematurely.<br /><br />A slightly longer band would allow you to fold back the strap under the floating (loose) buckle which is what those are for.  In this case it will never be used and becomes only a decoration.  I own some high end dress watches, Rolex, etc but this is my daily &#34;driver&#34;.<br /><br />Certainly a good value
B004D7GU3M|4.0|It arrived in a short period of time which was great. It also has exellent packaging. Have'nt opened it because it's a gift for someone, but everything else looks great.
B009DZDJU6|3.0|The movie was blah. To make matters worse I didn't realize I was purchasing the SD version so maybe I'm just blind, The inability to download the movie I purchased at a premium, to use as I please, will definitely keep me from purchasing anything else.
B008J34466|5.0|What can you say...I LOVE PINK! I enjoy hearing her deepest thoughts that always turn into an awesome song from her.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Glad I bought this on sale but the extras do make up for the 4th movies suckage. The box is definitely nice as are the 2 versions of each film.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I really liked this game, so much i spent money on buying more coins and jems. I loved it! but about halfway thru the game it just wiped clean, all the memory gone!! ..for no reason at all, I lost everything!! I'm sip upset and have not found a way to fix this at all :/
B0053O89KG|5.0|Each of the seasons have improved over these recent years in Castle and season four arrived to a wonderful climax that must be enjoyed!! I love it!
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Destroyer- Resurrected: The remix on this CD didn't dissapoint, i actually enjoy this version as much as if not more than the original.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Not all of my phone chargers are compatable  (mostly car chargers) the charging device has a long stub and the opening in the case does not allow the chargers to fit without taking off the case
B0096BIENY|3.0|I think there's too many repeats here, I am not even sure they are newly recorded, when I hear a live audience rendition I always assume that may be the same track.  Whatever, perhaps it's time for these guys to give us some real classical and stop the popover business.  I don't think they do that well with Presley or Orbison hits and though I have every single disk they have recorded/taped and liked them all, this one doesn't quite reach the same level of the past music.
B000000WA4|5.0|The 90's is the best decade of music... you should deffinately buy any and all Smashing Pumkin'scds.  Good product! A+
B001HDO4YW|1.0|One SIDE A, track 1 and 3 each have a discrepancy (from the pressing of the record).  We returned it and ordered another of the same LP.  Same problems!!!  A whole batch of the pressings must be bad?  All of my other 100's of LPs play just fine, so it is not a problem with the  needle or arm on the turntable.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|pearl jam is the best band ever... you should deffinately buy any and all pearl jam cds.  Good product! A+
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've always loved the Indiana Jones movies and Harrison Ford.  Had to have this in Blu-ray and the price was excellent.

B00198X0VS|5.0|Well if you've seen the first movie you have to have the second one.  Had to add it to my collection.
B000002AZ8|5.0|pearl jam is the best band ever... you should deffinately buy any and all pearl jam cds.  Good product! A+
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love all these action backed comic book movies.  Done very well and I had to add it to my collection.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|It is refreshing in today's age of hyper-realistic gaming to take a detour into a world where art and imagination work together to create a unique experience. There have been many reviews written about Journey and the studio that created these amazing games, so I will try not to be redundant. This is a complete package in terms of being able to enjoy what these games have to offer. You get a ton of concept art and other goodies, the entire ambient soundtracks of all three games, and some bonus mini-games from the studio. As a father, all three of these games are enjoyable for my two oldest kids (7 and 4), and got them thinking about all kinds of things, from the forces of nature, to microbiology, to some metaphysical musings that come with a playing of Journey itself. This is a great game, and can create an opportunity for a family to experience cutting edge gaming without the violence and gore.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you love sic-fi you'll love this set.  It was a great deal at the time and I'm glad I got it for my collection.
B000001EL3|5.0|Just as good as Dressed to Kill this is a classic album that any KISS fan must have in their collection.  Crank it up !
B0042L78MG|5.0|This is a great CD.  My cousin in Amsterdam turned me onto this artist.  So as soon as I got back to the states I ordered online.  Love her music.  And now I'm turning other on to it.
B004EPZ034|5.0|We bought this for our grandson but ended up watching it ourselves before we shipped it out. Great movie for the entire family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I got sucked in to the hype, drank the koolaid and have no regrets. Wonderful storyline that follows not only the aristocratic family, but the house help. Very interesting....love stories, intrigue....beautiful costumes. What are you waiting for....just get it!
1423124960|4.0|These are good books with lot of pictures and smooth papers...the binding is pretty good,no issues...however The stories may be little over the head for a 2 yrs...the only issue i found is the weight of the book, its 3+ pounds at least...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun ss hell. I have a blast playing this game. give it a try. I I I I I I I
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I have the whole collection and love re-watching each episode. I have been hooked since it first aired on the CW. I look forward to new episodes each week! Can't get enough of the Salvatore brothers!!
B000059MEK|5.0|Amazing album from start to finish and I can't help but dance when this is playing in my ride and you'll feel the same even though it's almost 12 years old now. 5 super bright stars. All the detractors of this album need to realize that they can't make homework over and over again.  Daft punk need room to grow much like DJ shadow did after endtroducing but people still want him to make that record over and over again I say just grow with the artist.
B00004RF9I|4.0|Pretty good movie. A bit more screaming at each<br />other than what I like. My husband wanted to  see<br />it...we had seen it years ago
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Same above what I juss said which is very fun to play and very challenging game for your brain to play
0547884591|5.0|There is not a single step in the process that started in Tim's mind and ended up in your hands that has not been meticulously deconstructed, analyzed and optimized. At least that's the impression you get.<br /><br />Great content, great readability, great promotion, everything is a 10/10. If you are smart, you'll enjoy meeting Tim. If you are not, better be interested in fast cooking and/or consider something else.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This second book kept me interested & I read it non-stop all the way to the end!  I just started the 3rd book & don't want it to end as quickly, so I'm trying to pace myself!  :P I had stopped reading fiction for many years & then read the Hunger Games, loved it & wanted something else that was in a similar vein.  I'm very happy I discovered the Matched trilogy!
030758836X|4.0|A very dark and complicated but mesmerizing tale with lots of twists and turns. Unlike anything else I've read. I would recommend it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|At first the book was a bit confusing.But once you got into the book it was the best book I've read .I like how they had two narraters to give diffrent point of views.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Woild have gave it 5 stars but then noted it was not made in Japan. Still a nice watch. Simple and clean looking.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I loved the first movie and i love this one just can't give away any spoilers lol the smarts odd Holmes is just amazing
B001TODCII|2.0|All violence and his point of view, she is in the beginning and the end and you have no idea of her side of the story.
0345803493|2.0|Better 1 is better than book 2.  And again the author used the same descriptives when decribing the intimate scenes
B00008EY7H|4.0|amazing espectacle, good quality image, nice to look at it from time to time but after some time the things in it wont amaze you like the first time
0345803485|3.0|It was an okay book, but most of the descriptives became a bit redundant.  It was like the author was describing the same scene over and over.
030758836X|5.0|I had never heard of this author but had the oppurtunity to buy her book at a discount and gave it a shot. And I am so happy that I did. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It has suspense, twists, and is so thought provoking. I highly recommend this read to anyone who likes a good suspense thriller. You won't regret it.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|My 21 month old son loves Dumbo so I had to get him the dvd for Christmas. You cant go wrong with a classic.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|If you don't own it yet, you certanily need to get this Disney classic and add it to your collection.  It will be a treasure for years to come.
B004ZJZPXO|4.0|My brother-in-law recommended that we watch &#34;Firefly&#34; and we absolutely loved it.  We were sad that the series had such a short run so we watched this movie and had all the loose ends tied up.  I love syfy and westerns and this just brought them both together seamlessly.  Excellent writing and superb acting made this a must see for syfy fans.  Wish they could bring the series back with new episodes with the original cast.
B004G600A4|4.0|Enjoyed watching the movie. My only criticism is that there is just a tad too much violence for a disney flick.  Watching Rapunzel go after a dude with a frying pan scared my 7 year old cousin.  I don't understand the need for such senseless violence.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I love the MIB franchise and couldn't wait to get this one for my husband.  This is one of his Christmas gifts so I was glad that it came in time for gift giving.
B001L5J5GS|5.0|I was completely satisified with this re-issue.Great vinyl, noiseless ,great sound, not a single defect.Very happy with this purchase.Would recommend to anybody.
B002Z58GQI|4.0|Have had this device for several months and it works as advertised. Good price and the company had it shipped out the next day. I would recommend product and the company to a friend.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Great book,great re-issue, lousy pressing.Noisy vinyl ,occasional pops and all albums in my set are off-centered.Well-one gets what he pays for.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This is a great movie.  There are parts that are a bit weird, but it is a good twist to the story of Snow White.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was by far the best G5 game I have played.  I've played most of the games available for Kindle Fires and really enjoyed this one. Just the right amount of EVERYTHING - HO - puzzles - suspense.  Hope there will be a sequel that follows along the same line.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|\\"Django Unchained\\" is the soundtrack to the Quentin Tarantino movie of the same name and much like soundtracks to his other movies, contains snippets of film dialogue, a few Ennio Morricone instrumentals, and some songs written especially for the movie - the latter a first for a Tarantino movie.<br /><br />A trio of sweeping cinematic sixties/seventies ballads by Argentine/Italian composer Luis Bacalov feature; the Tom Jones-style \\"Django\\", the groovy Soul of \\"Lo Chiamavano King (His Name Is King)\\" and the dramatic instrumental \\"La Corsa (2nd Version)\\". Three beautiful Morricone instrumentals also feature; the guitar-driven pair of \\"The Braying Mule\\" and \\"Sister Sara's Theme\\" and the theatrical \\"Un Monumento\\". Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton (who sounds like a cross between Leela James and Norah Jones) perform the lovely acoustic soulful \\"Freedom\\" singing the chorus \\"I'm looking for freedom, looking for freedom, and to find it, cost me everything I have, well I'm looking for freedom, I'm looking for freedom, and to find it, may take everything I have\\" against clanking chains in the background.<br /><br />The folky \\"I Got A Name\\" is by Jim Croce, while \\"I Giorni Dell'ira\\" is a beautiful spaghetti western-style instrumental by Riz Ortolani. Rapper Rick Ross performs the Jamie Foxx-produced \\"100 Black Coffins\\". \\"I need 100 black coffins for 100 bad men / dig 100 black graves so I can lay they a** in\\" he raps against pseudo-martial beats and ominous harmonies. \\"Nicaragua\\" is a spare instrumental by Jerry Goldsmith\\", while the haunting acoustic \\"Ancora Qui\\" is by Elisa Toffoli and Morricone, recorded specially for the movie. The retro Funk \\"Unchained (The Payback / Untouchable)\\" is by James Brown and 2Pac. The midtempo \\"Who Did that To You\\" is by John Legend and is the brilliance one would expect from him. \\"Too Old to Die Young\\" is Delta Blues by Brother Edge, and closing cut \\"Trinity (Titoli)\\" features a distinctive whistle and is by Annibale E i Cantori Moderni.<br /><br />The older songs came from Tarantino's vinyl collection, complete with all the pops and cracks to add to the atmosphere. The new fits in with the old like a glove, even Rick Ross' Hip Hop. A winner!/><br />The older songs came from Tarantino's vinyl collection, complete with all the pops and cracks to add to the atmosphere.

B0050R0XEG|5.0|Item came in reasonable time and was correct item ordered.<br />Always has required pieces to assemble picture of item on front of carton.
B0002HYC8C|5.0|Our little boy loves the set.  He has had a lot of play with it.  I used it in pre-school Sunday School class during a Noah's Ark lesson and it survived well.  Some of the animals are too small for very young children.
034580404X|5.0|So this is not epic high brow fancy worded literature. This is great libido incineration. For entertainment and titillation, I heeded the reviews and agree that the writing is not exactly elegant but I just wanted something to ignite the fire and it served its purpose perfectly.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I started reading this book with little hope of enjoying it since after all it was a free book. However from the minute I strategist couldn't put it down. I loved it. I had never read this author before but plan on reading her other books now. Great author.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I should have reviewed this album on its standalone merits but now I've heard all three albums in the trilogy so it's hard to be impartial and not think about how it compares with the other two. All in all, it's an excellent album but compared to Dos and Tre, I think it is uneven and some of the lyrics seem haphazard and sloppy to me. Take \\"Nuclear Family\\" for example - it's a good song, catchy and the perfect start to the album. But the countdown at the end is hokey and diminishes the entire song. Same thing with \\"Fell For You\\" - the line, \\"making paper planes just for awhile\\" is so lame it's enough to ruin an otherwise good song. \\"Kill the DJ\\" will live in infamy with most Green Day fans - pointless filler.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some great songs on this album. Rusty James is a great song, definitely a best-of and \\"Carpe Diem\\" is an anthem for aging rockers. Of course, the single \\"Oh Love\\" is another excellent song. \\"Sweet 16\\" shows a bit of a sweet side that some punk fans don't like, but I think it's a really good song. As always with Green Day, the production value is first-rate and makes most of the CD a joy to.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Ignore the reviews telling you not to watch this film. Watch it then decide for yourself. Not everybody likes the same movies so you need to be the judge. I enjoyed it because i like piecing things together. I don't know what the people were expecting who left negative reviews. . Its a documentary not an action film! Maybe they just didn't pick up or understand the little details? But anyway its a good story about a lonely person with some obstacles in life who created a new life in her head & online.
B008G59IKO|5.0|The second installment of Green Day's Trilogy has some fantastic songs - and a few that aren't so great. I'm not going to bore you and insult your intelligence by &#34;grading&#34; each song, but I think the general consensus is that &#34;F Time&#34; is simple-minded and lame, and there are 2 or 3 others that are pretty easy to skip - which ones depend on personal taste. But the rest of the songs on Dos more than make up for it. One thing I like about this CD is the diverse influences - great punk rock(Lazy Bones, Baby Eyes), acoustic (Amy), 80s metal rock (Make Out Party), 60s rock (Stray Heart)and even a little John Lennon influence (Wild One). &#34;Nightlife&#34; has strong urban influences that many reviewers have panned, but given the theme of the song I like it and think it works.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie was just disgusting. The character of Ted was just too disgusting and rude to find funny. The movie was oriented towards twenty-something frat dudes who love bad words and smoking weed. The \\"comedy\\" is just vile crude jokes by the characters. The writers clearly have no real skill in creating clever jokes.<br />If you have an education, any semblance of a mature mind, or something else to do, don't watch this movie.
B008G59IBI|5.0|The thing I've enjoyed most about the Uno, Dos, Tre trilogy is the mix of punk, pop, rock and (to the disgust of many judging from the reviews of Dos) even urban. Most of the songs on Tre are good old rock and roll, with the exceptions of two punk songs: Sex, Drugs and Violence and Dirty Rotten Bastards. The melodies are fantastic, lyrics are strong and the production is, as usual for Green Day, amazing. So if you don't mind more of a pop/rock emphasis than a punk flavor, you will love this CD.<br /><br />If you are a fan of punk, then Dirty Rotten Bastards will be heaven for you. It has all the earmarks of a Green Day classic. Brutal Love is a memorable, moving song in the blues-rock classic fashion. X-Kid's sound is reminiscent of late 80's rock and the theme is original and relevant to today's youth - it's another song that deserves to be in a \\"best of\\" someday. That's three songs, but the ones in between are great songs as well. There really is not a song on this CD you should skip, and that's a rarity these days.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Easy to understand and have the necessary information about communication, body language and how to use it to get succeeded while approaching people.
030758836X|2.0|Saw on television a conversation about the book.  Ordered it on my e reader.  Got fed up waiting for something to happen.  In the end, skipped to the last chapter. Complete waste of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is pure awesome and all you other people who have not tried this should yahoo it's in its early stages but It will have more updates. Like right now it's 0.5.0 and it's really good I think everyone who plays video games should get mine for either PC pocket edition or Xbox version. I think everyone should get it even though it cost $7.00 it's way worth it! And that's all I have to say about this game bye. And have fun!
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Such a fun show.  I have seen it many  times but wanted to show it to  my kids.  A lot of swearing
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a wonderful singing bowl that lets the user set the time for chimes.  There are a variety of bowl sounds, and this has been a wonderful addition to my collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun and very addicting.its fun because its challenging.i love this game so much. i think everybody should try playing it ull love it so much
B008R14YBK|5.0|This is pop perfection. All the songs are great. The production and mix is A+. The vocals are perfectly in tune. Pop doesn't get much better than this!
B0085YNML2|5.0|I enjoy this type of game challenging with adorable critters. Similar to bag it and cut the rope. love it!
B008RV5K4U|4.0|A good adaptation of the greatest batman story...<br /><br />But the \\"adaptation\\" is missing the most important element : Batman's voice over detailing his train of thought.  This was a major part in understanding batman's motives in storyline in the book.  Without it those unfamiliar with the book will not understand many of the scenes.<br /><br />A Major FAIL
B007PTJOV0|3.0|not very happy with my experience. it freezes and makes you lose.  I got to world six and it wont let me do anything now. maybe you can figure it out.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This film will never be considered \\"great\\" cinema, but it's sure fun to watch.  In the industry, these are called \\"popcorn films,\\" with good reason.  Lots of really, really good music by a talented cast, and a bit of a love story as well.  Suspend your disbelief, get some snacks together, and have a great evening.  Heck, the \\"cups\\" number is worth the price of admission!  And Fat Amy?  You gotta love her.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|The watch is soo cute, I just love it. It looks fancy and very nice. Love the litle pretend diamonds around it.
B00AH8V0DG|5.0|This show is so tantalizing, funny, naughty, and damn right ridiculous. Once again the writers have given the viewers a roller coaster ride of a a season, and boy what a climax in the last episode. I can't wait for season 6.
0307744434|4.0|No spoilers in this one! I loved this book, its characters and settings. The author created a unique blend of magic and humanity that worked well together. Well worth the read, I look forward to the next offering from this author.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|If you like Amy W, you will like Duffy.<br /><br />I need nine more words for it to allow me to enter what I really want to say
1476715904|5.0|Loved this book. It had it all. I laughed and cried. It was amazing and you can relate to the characters. I'm so glad Point of Retreat was already out when I read this because if I had to wait I would have been heartbroken.
0061730335|5.0|Before the boy harvested the wind he endured incredible hardships. such as surviving starvation.  Moreover, the stories of his vapid meals are gut wrenching,  almost incredulously.  In addition, his parents did not have the money to keep him in school, so he had to drop out.  Yet, hardships are usually ephemeral, as William Kamkwamba learned. More importantly, he did not want his education to ebb.  So, he began studying physics- harnessing the wind- by going to the library and reading about \\"The Wind.\\"  This story is too good to tell you any more; I think my agurement will be more cogent after you read a copy of the book.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Have read both AS and Fountainhead in the last year - second time for both.  Astonishing prescience by Rand.  I don't buy into her philosophy entirely but think most of what she points out in both novels is relevant today.  Should be required reading, along with Karl Marx, in college.

0446693804|5.0|I've never read any of nicholas sparks books till this one and am now in love with his writting like everyone else! heart warming and will make you cry at least once! very small book so easy to get through in a timely manner if you don't have much time on your hands.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This is a very well done book. As I was reading, it felt like I was alone in my house during an apocalypse reading this book and learning how to fend off a zombie siege. I'd have to say that my favorite part of this book was looking at the stories. I don't know if these are actually all real but they seem very lifelike and disturbing. I highly recommend this book to any zombie enthusiast and with \\"2012-Doomsday\\" right around the corner, this guide could be a lifesaver.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I love this book! It's very long but I consider it to still be an easy read. Great characters, a little bit of history mixed in, and an overall heartwarming story!
0345803485|4.0|We got a real spark from reading this at bedtime.  She seemed to get quite aroused from the descriptions found therein.
1439153663|5.0|This is a very well written, excellent book! couldn't put it down! I'd say 15 years+. I have no doubt that this story could have happened in the past but I consider the content to be 'strong' and I wouldn't let any one below high school read it. If your a fan of historical fiction this is a must read book!

B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is such a fun game my 7 and 8 year old brothers loove it too! Ive told all my friends about it. it is the most fun app on my kindle I really like it it is worth the dollar and 1 dollar isn't that much.

B008GXHOFW|4.0|Hey welcome to another review and this one is about The Amazing SpiderMan this game is amazing the irony haha anyways there is some lag here and there but not bad and the graphics are awesome but being a Gameloft game it includes a extra download and I had to delete almost all my games! Which is now stored on the cloud :( anyways the reason I gave it 4/5 is because it doesnt tell you when it saves theres no save button so that sucks because  when you close the game you dont know if you saved it or not like I just beat a boss and it didnt save! which means I gotta do it again -_- thats really stupid anyways great game!4/5!<br /><br />Austin The Game Reviewer
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first, I was left with many questions and this book did a wonderful job filling me in. I am very excited to conclude the series with the final book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We LOVE this show! We watched this season through instant video, and will definitely be buying the DVD version when it becomes available!
1442419814|3.0|This is the first and best book of the series.  Nowhere near Hunger Games quality, but entertaining enough.  If you're bored after this one, don't continue, they only get worse.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is my new favorite game, I use it everyday on the train, can't get enough of it and would recommend it to everyone.
1439152802|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and have loved them all and this one is no exception. The book Secret Keeper has a secret and it keeps you guessing to what it is until the very end. This is one of those books that once you finish it and learn its secrets you have to reread it to catch every thing you missed the first time when didn't know what was going on! It is so good!<br /><br />The first chapter reels you in with Laurel watching her mother stab and kill a strange man from their doorstep when she was young. Then it keeps you guessing as to what happened. Why did Dorothy kill the man? Who was the man? What happened in Dorothy's past to make her kill him? Over and over questions go around in your head and then right when you think you know what is happening another twist and it leaves you asking more questions!<br /><br />The books goes from Laurels childhood, to the present where Laurel is an adult and her mother Dorothy is on the brink of death by old age. It also takes you to Dorothy past when she was a teenager to really give you everything you need to know as to why Dorothy killed that man when Laurel was a child. I think the past, Dorothy time during WWII was my favorite part. The characters are much more appealing. Jimmy, Vivien, Dorothy and even the old lady Dorothy was living with.<br /><br />A great quote in the book at the beginning that starts the whole thing is:<br />\\"After 50 years all it took was the return of an old photograph and the utterance of a woman's name for the fabric of Laurel's fiction to to begin unraveling\\"<br /><br />I recommend it, very great read :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is highly addictive. my friend got me into it and I do it before bed every night. it calms me down
1118156315|5.0|Great approach, very clear and very thorough. A must buy for anybody wanting to change something in their life.<br />Very, very pleased with the purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It is Very challenging and engaging. Like that I have to earn the games by winning.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As most books in the Harry Bosch series have done, The Black Box kept me up late into the night racing towards that last page, only to be sorry it was all over when I reached it! I agree completely with the reviewer who compares Harry to a fine wine - he keeps getting better with age!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I have a hard staying interested in the books because at times i feel like there is more sex than actual plot in the storyline. I feel like if the author added just a bit more suspense to the storyline i would enjoy reading more.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|I downloaded this app to be able to check my college emails on the go but it wouldn't synch. nice attempt though. the layout and idea is nice just wish it really worked.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've had 3-4 pairs of these headphones over the years, and are still my favorite all-occasion headphones. They are lightweight, comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and sound great. The only negative issue for me is that the cord is a little shorter than I would like.  I'm 6'0\\", and a bit long-waisted, and if I put my MP3 player in my front pants pocket, the cord is just barely long enough to reach it with the headphones on my head, so an extra 6\\" to 12\\" of cord would be perfect. Oh, I've bought a couple cheap knock-off brands from Big Lots that looked the same, but had a huge difference in sound quality. Stick with Sony; they are worth the small difference in price.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works great.  Quick shipping and I was able to plug it in, load the software and be up as a comm port on my Windows 7 box in minutes. Would definitely recommend this to others.

0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman presents mature theories and solutions to the messy economic situation in the USA (and even worse in my own continent - Europe). The ultraliberals (libertarians) and the conservatives must realize that cutting is killing. It is easy to be self-satisfied when you live in a rich country, as I do. As one of very few oil rich countries that has managed to avoid the resource trap, we are really lucky. In my opinion Krugman has many ideas that has turned a bad economy into a healthy economy. A government has to be strong enough to really matter, there should not be such a horrendous difference between the rich and the poor and the school system should give good opportunities, now matter witch family you are born into. You might call this communism or socialism, but it isn´t. In Norway we call it social democracy. Thank you Paul Krugman!

B005P5TQPU|4.0|Nothing like two brothers traveling across the states to save unwitting victims from supernatural horrors. I highly recommend watching this series.
B0079R8KO0|2.0|As a lefty, it would be nice if the case could be set to flip the opposite way.  I find I usually remove the case because if opens into my left hand and is constantly getting in the way.  Wasted money.
0156027321|5.0|This is a very special story. I haven't even finished the book yet, but so far, 90% read, I would recommend it to everyone.  Yann Martel certainly knows how to tell a story and keep your interest to the point that you can't put the book down.
1400069289|4.0|This book gives a really interesting look at habits and why we do what we do.  This is definitely worth reading.

0312330537|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. I have read a lot of books. Seriously good from beginning to end.  I really enjoyed it completely and recommend it highly.  Just get it and find out for yourself.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|The cover is a high quality. The only negative is the gold leaf. With less than a weeks wear, the gold leafing already started to rub off. Aside from that, I am very pleased with the purchase.
0786955570|5.0|I got this for my daughter and me to play on game night. It is tons of fun and we had a blast with all the little pieces. True to the D&D world and fun to play. Thumbs up! Now my daughter wants to know more about the D&D world.
0525478817|5.0|A wonderful book about life, death, and love. Enjoyed every page.<br />definitely recommend it any young adult and young adult fiction fan
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Absolutely beautiful CD... in parts you'd think Jerry stepped down from heaven and played a few tracks.... well done, Neal... a must have for any serious Black Crowes/Grateful Deadhead.... If I could do music, this is what I would love to create!
B007Q0OUNA|4.0|The other night I just had a craving to build a Lego set so I ran to the store and grabbed Attack on Weathertop, a Lego set I have had my eyes on for quite sometime.  My Lego display is split into two categories: I have a regular Lego town and I have a spooky, haunted Lego world.  I thought Weathertop would be an excellent addition to my spooky Lego world and as it turns out, it is! It is a wonderfully organic piece that nicely conveys the ancient ruins being overrun buy growth and ravaged by time. The set nicely replicates a very exciting and important scene from the Fellowship of the Ring. After putting the set together, I was impressed with the design and the minifigures but found I was less excited by the set as a whole than I thought I would be. Here's my thoughts on Attack on Weathertop:<br /><br />The Facts:<br />  # of pieces: 430 and 1 instruction manual<br />  Minifigures: Frodo, Aragorn, Merry, two Ringwraiths, two horses.<br />  Lego's MSRP: $59.99<br /><br />The Positives:<br /><br />*I think everyone of Lego's LOTR minifigures has been a hit. They are immediately recognizable, extremely detailed, and come with nice accessories (everyone has a sword and there are rings, torches, and cooking supplies). This set comes with 5 minifigures and 2 horses which is a nice assortment. The new horses are fantastic and really fun for any Lego characters needing a black horse with red eyes.<br /><br />*Weathertop has a very interesting design. It uses hinged pieces effectively to make a rounded structure. Weather top looks nice as a standalone structure from all sides but also opens up to reveal the interior of the ruins. Little tufts of weeds and green bricks give this structure a nice, overgrown appearance.<br /><br />*Weathertop does have quite a few cool little details. My favorite is the usage of gray microfigures to emulate little statues found around the structure. There is also a working trapdoor, a weapons rack with old, rusty weapons, some type of old candleabra, a rat, and a little rock outcropping with a dry bush that is seperate from the main build.<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />*While I know that Lego likes to add in \\"play features\\" for younger fans, weathertop has some weird missiles that launch out of the side of a wall. What are they supposed to represent? I have no idea but they're just bizarre.<br /><br />*Some elements of the structure are a little weak. The stairs leading up to Weathertop have a difficult time staying properly in place when you're moving the set.<br /><br />*For the price, I wish the set was a little larger. There is barely enough room on top to have Aragorn and Frodo fight the Ringwraiths, much less if you wanted to accurately recreate the scene with more wraiths and more Hobbits.<br /><br />Overall: I like this set because it adds a nice ruined structure to my Lego world. I wish it were either a little larger or a little cheaper but it does nicely represent the scene it is based off of. The minis are excellent and the additional pieces and accessories are quite nice. It isn't the best LOTR set (that would be Bag End, which is technically a Hobbit set) but it is a fun, unique build.leabra, a rat, and a little rock outcropping with a dry bush that is seperate from the main build.<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />*While I know that Lego likes to add in \\"play features\\" for younger fans, weathertop has some weird missiles that launch out of the side of a wall.

B0092QITO2|5.0|I'm a fan of the Len Wiseman and Kate Beckinsale team-ups.  I'm a fan of both Jessica Biel and Colin Farrell.  I liked the original and love what they did with this remake.  ...but am I the only one who thinks the audio and video are out of sync?  It looks like Kate Beckinsale is speaking English, being dubbed over in English... it's just not timed right.  I seem to remember having the same thought when I saw it in the theatre way back when.  Oh well, maybe there will be a remastered version.

B008ELUEQC|5.0|I'm going to write about the credit card I paid for this purchase with.  Tried to buy several other CD's with the exact same card, maybe two weeks after this purchase, and it was declined, several times.  No idea why.  Same credit card I've been using all over town and no information changed.  My husband had also purchased several items with this card......

B00A3YTC6Q|2.0|The movie and dancing was good, I have all 4 of the Step Up series and I'd say this has to be one of my fav's. I for some reason thought that by purchasing the movie it gave me the option to stream or download. The quality of the streaming was terrible. It was very grainy. I have a HD LED 55' flat screen and I streamed it off of my laptop to the TV. I've done this many times with other streaming or even movies from the laptop dvd and not had issues with the quality previously but it was really bad. Next time I will take the time to order the physical DVD/BluRay as this didn't save me any $.

0525953590|5.0|This is a very timely review of the one of the biggest stories in physics in the past decade, the search for the Higgs particle.  While not directly involved in the search Carroll has the background and contacts to provide an insiders view of the process and why the discovery is so important.  While telling the story of the politics and personalities behind the scene, Carroll also describes the physics in terms that a motivated layman can follow to understand why the Higgs particle matters and what the implications are for future research.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|My Stealth Trio tablet isn't your normal Android. I have to download my apps on my own and not from Google. This ES File Explorer has been awesome.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|How cool is Hulk? The whole family loved watching this. The monsters were way over the top destroying New York.
0061743526|5.0|Deep in the heart of Alabama in 1935, a white man's word stood against a black man's word. It's not hard to see that this unwritten rule, a byproduct of segregation, opens the door for any ignorant psychopath to take advantage of those who cannot defend themselves. Indeed, a whole underclass of white trash made use of this situation in one way of another. It is a bit ironic that in 1935 the Supreme Court building opened with the inscription in stone of  \\"Equal Justice under Law\\". At least, a strong current of idealism was being kept alive, and was not totally lost in the law so that it could not be reclaimed. A few people in a place like Monroeville, Alabama, had the courage to resist convention. But the status quo was so fiercely upheld, and emotions of a drunken mob so hard to control.<br /><br />As  other reviewers have pointed out, the strength of this book comes from the point of view of a child, the narrator, who doesn't have an established adult position to defend, and has a father who instills in her a sense of equal justice. She and her brother try and come to terms with their world. In the course of their education -thanks to what they learn more at home than at school -  they meet many quirky characters in the town, and learn about some of their secrets and their unexpected courage and good will.<br /><br />It is clear that this novel closely parallels Harper Lee's actual childhood in a number of ways. For one thing, she was a close friend of Truman Capote, who is the model of Dill Harris. Together they attended legal proceedings at the county courthouse where her father as a lawyer apparently had a very similar role as Atticus Finch in the book. Truman Capote also verified that some of the events actually happened.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you can handle the sadness then this book is a must read. After reading the first two books in the trilogy I expected for this one to be less exciting, but I was consumed by the book.
B005LAII08|5.0|I can keep the Blu Ray disk at my house, and let my granddaughter take the DVD disc home.  Great value.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Like the first this one is really hard to put down. The author keeps leaving you wanting more. Read the book in three day, but I have to say its depressing.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much!  Was very exciting and suspenseful!  Would like to read more like this book where you can follow the map along with the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just couldn't put it down. I finished this book in two days. It just draws you in and you feel connected to the characters.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I first heard about this restaurant in an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. A small, not special looking restaurant where the chef makes the sushi right in front of you and then stares at you while you eat it.<br />And this has been going on for more than half a century.<br />The documentary looks at his way of looking at food and sushi in particular. We follow his staff, mostly his son, look for the best possible ingredients. The relationship with his son is a main thread of the documentary. He has two sons, one of which left to start his own restaurant, a mirror image of his father's and with one fewer Michelin star.<br />It is a beautiful movie that gives great insight into the mind of a special sushi chef. I will now start saving to one day visit this restaurant.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|This was for my husband and he apparently needed some cable that they don't sell and we can't find anywhere.  Nice that this was bought and just sits everywhere waiting patiently to get used and it never will.
B00AMGYXP0|3.0|I really enjoyed \\"Ted,\\" which is the story of a teddy bear who comes to life and grows up alongside his childhood BFF and owner, Johnny (Mark Wahlberg). Ted grows into a disgusting, foul bear who unwittingly alienates Johnny's relationship with his girlfriend (Mila Kunis). While there were some hilariously funny (and downright wrong) comedic moments, they were fewer and far between than I expected. Perhaps \\"Family Guy\\" fans (which I am not one of) appreciate this humor more than I do. I just felt that after a while, it was a lot of the same kind of jokes over and over again, and it just wasn't that clever. Still, the premise of the film is hilarious, and it's definitely worth checking out.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Ok, yes, I was expecting beefcake, but had hope that it would have at least a little bit of plot... dang it really didn't... Channing of course is yummy & a phenomenal dancer, but well, it wasn't worth the rental fee, I wish I had waited until it had gotten to RedBox... If you want something with almost no plot, and random connections, but cute boys, this is for you.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I say go for this bc you get more in this since it's so old, it's really cheap now and you get more exercises too than the newer ones!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This is the first movie that I bought for my new Blu Ray player and it was amazing. I enjoyed the movie but it isn't my favorite. I bought it for my grandaughter (6 yr old) and she was so so about it. But it will have its place in my collection and will be watched hopefully for many more years to come.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|My boyfriend and I watch this every year around Christmas, but this year it wasn't being played on Netflix. I knew this would be the perfect Christmas gift. I just had to give it to him early!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|stupid game wont even install on my kindle fire...not worth your money and read the other reviews apparently there is no more than 2 levels. J ust don't even bother with this game horrible.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Sorry but I did not watch all of the movie.  Maybe one day I will watch it bit it was slow
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Frankly I don't understand all the high ratings for this book. On the plus side, (and as some other reviewer mentioned), the book is essentially free of grammatical and spelling errors, which is always nice to see for any book, self-published or not. The dialogue was reasonable and steady too.<br /><br />I liked the fact that most things in the book were consistent with the picture of silo life that the author creates in the book, but it's really hard to believe that the silo planners thought that 50 separate silos containing hundreds of years of dumb people and one master person in IT as the silo boss would be the best and most robust shot humanity had to recover after the planet was trashed in a war of some kind. No helping each other in case of need? No real communication or interaction among the populace or with other silos? If help or communication was not intended or allowed, why provide radio links to the other silos? Why provide radios at all? To me, this is a big gaping hole in the overall plot and scenario.<br /><br />My biggest feelings about the book (actually 5 books) is that the whole pace and plot of the book seemed to plod along, like the people in the book climbing the long spiral stairway in the silos. Plod, plod, a steady, slugging, slow forward progress, page after page, with nothing much happening along the way. Kind of tedious to read in many places, and an easy book to put down to continue to read later.<br /><br />I'm always reluctant to write reviews like this, given all the imagination and work the authors obviously put in (especially since I've written a couple of technical books myself). But if I was the editor, I'd cut the size of the book in half, and ask for some more action and more rapid progress in the plots, for sure. Then the book wouldn't be such a slow, plodding drag to read (unless it was intended to be that way, which is a different issue in itself--why make the reader suffer through it?)<br /><br />I was lucky enough to buy this on the Kindle Daily Deal, so I can say that the book was worth the money I spent on it. And I'm grateful for that. But I would certainly be unhappy if I had paid full price the book, for sure. There are far better books for the money, in that case. I would not recommend it to my friends now (although I did recommend it to my friend on KDD day based on all the high ratings on the website).
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This is by far my favorite cover for my Kindle Fire.  It is soft and very comfortable to hold.  Being a book reader I also love the writing on the front. It looks like a page right out of a book!  The color is also very eye appealing.  This cover is very well made and my Kindle hasn't slipped once from the inside binding, if anything I find it a little bit of a struggle to remove since it is so snug.  Wonderful product!
B008645YH6|5.0|This is a great album.  Go ahead, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  &#34;Power and Control&#34; and &#34;Starring Role&#34; are great complements to the better-known songs on this album, such as &#34;Home-wrecker&#34; and &#34;Primadonna.&#34;  I saw her live a few months ago opening for Coldplay, and I eventually decided to go ahead and make this purchase.  This has to be one of the better albums I've purchased.  She really has grown on me.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Considering I am one to love hidden item games, I definitely love this game. This game definitely has you on your toes
B009329Y30|5.0|The whole movie kept you interested and engaged.<br />The base of a good love story was engaging.<br />Enjoyed the acting and they did such a good job getting the viewer involved.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORATE MOVE.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIME HE WATCHES IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  THIS YEAR I WILL WATCH IT AND THINK OF HIM. HE DIED SUDDENLY IN MAY AND THIS WILL BRING BACK GRAT MEMORIES.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is definitely a chick-flick but it is a great story line.  I love the way the story intertwines the lives of the servants and the family.
B0098460O4|4.0|Jonathan has an amazing voice - unfortunately, it is drowned out on this album by the choir, the orchestra and Charlotte.  I am sorry to say that I prefer to listen to their performance on Showbiz and BGT.  I hope future offerings curb the orchestra and eliminate the choir - and allow Jonathan's voice be as loud as Charlotte's.  I look forward to a solo album by Jonathan, and more duo albums with some balance.  The song choices are interesting, and in my opinion reflect the nature of these two young people. The producers just need to let Johnathan sing - no one paid to hear an excessively loud choir!!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|After seeing a commercial for this book series, I figured it was worth a chance. I do like it so far but I do find myself wanting more details about certain things. I like how they had it switch between Cassia and Ky talking.

B0086700CM|4.0|It's pretty entertaining of a game. It's worth the download for sure. I don't play it much anymore but still.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved the characters. Started it at 6:00 last night and here I am at 1:30 in the afternoon and I'm sad it's over. My boss is probably sad I called in sick so I could read.
0399226907|5.0|My boyfriend is adorable and loves this book from his childhood. I had to get him a copy of it, and he loved it. :)
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the story quite well but thought that the writing was very repetitive and novice.  I quickly tired of reading the same phrases multiple times and began to skim chapters.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Fun for all true Star Trek fans. My only criticism is that the end seems to drag on and on.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|We watched the whole thing, but we couldn't wait for it to end.  It was a little ridiculous.  The narration wasn't funny.  The storyline was ADD.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Very nice case, and provides really good protection for the phone. The free film that comes with it is pretty nice too.<br />The case looks really nice on a white iPhone.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|These kids have wonderful voices.  Their harmonies are fantastic and it just makes me smile to listen to them.  If you love traditional Christmas music, you will love this.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Yes, the title and the filler text is silly. Yes, it does sound occasionally as if it was meant for 14 year olds.<br /><br />That said, the actual contents are nothing short of awesome. The training regimen is very well built with a very good gradient between the various exercises. If you're looking for a good strength program, get it for yourself, or it would also make a great gift.<br /><br />In fact, if you DO know any 14 year old boys, get them this book for Christmas. Even if they are weak and nerdy. ESPECIALLY if they are weak and nerdy. You'll be doing them a service for life. :)
B005QTGFL8|5.0|I love their music sooo much and I just had to buy this album for my phone and its pretty good.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game. It is very nice for relaxing &amp; passing time.  One small problem is that there is not much support. I cannot find out how to use the Hearts that should give me another life. But, overall It is a good simple game.
B008S80OU2|5.0|In my opinion this box set was done perfectly.I didn't have to open each CD because none of them had shrink wrap.Each came in it's own little LP jacket.They were all placed in order inside the wrapped box.Also, I liked the just one booklet.Who would want to mess with a different booklet for 16 CD's? All the info you need is in the 1 booklet.The sound quality is excellent.My only critique would be I was hoping for a little bit better sound in the newly remastered &#34;ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES&#34;.It stills sounds better than it used to.There is a whole lot of music in this box and I would not recommend to people who only know &#34;Don't Fear The Reaper&#34; and &#34;Godzilla&#34;. Great job Columbia! The only thing that would have made this box set any better would have been if it came with a sticker!
B00824X3U0|5.0|It arrived on time. My son requested  this as a Christmas gift so I can't say how he liked it .

B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughters and I enjoyed this movie for all the same reasons as everyone else (no bad guys, no romance, friends who support each other...)  I also found this movie to be a refreshing view of twinship.  I know I may be overly senstive, but I can't help but notice that most, no ALL, fictional twins are just copies of each other... speaking in unison etc.  Tinkerbell and Periwinkle (while having lots in common) are not just clones... they're not even dressed alike!  Its nice for my identical daughters to see a more individualized view of twins.  I also love the scene where they learn they are born of the same laugh... the laugh is basically an egg splitting to create the two fairies,  and I'm sure will be the reference point when our girls get curious about how they came to be twins!  There's plenty of years ahead for science... for now, let the fairies explain everything!!
B003O5MOES|4.0|This album by Bruce was brand new to me.I had never even heard one song off of it.I sure am glad I bought it.(at a good price too)To me this album is a cross between NEBRASKA and TUNNEL OF LOVE.The tales on this album are more rough than those on Tunnel but not as hardcore as those on Nebraska.Every fan of Bruce should like this record.\\"Dancing in the Dark\\" it ain't.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch is a really good writer, as in really, really good.  He knows his literature.  And with \\"Pines\\" he proves himself to be in that rarified air of authors who not only are terrific writers at the peak of their craft, but also commercially successful, which is another quiver in the writer's bow - it means he has written a fast-paced, riveting and beautifully rendered page-turner.  Home run.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fast moving, a very good read. Never knew what was going to happen next. The ending was great, you wanted to help them figure out that they were really in love with each other.
B0059XTU22|4.0|Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, King Kong) has entered the world of J.R.R. Tolkien again and for me with a very slow start. Fran Walsh (Lord of the Rings, King Kong), Philippa Boyens (Lord of the Rings, King Kong), Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro(Pan's Labyrinth, Mimic) all helmed the screenplay and seemingly did a nice effort to capture the innocence of Bilbo Baggins if a little short on substance.<br /><br />Well let's talk about the stand out performances - surprisingly Martin Freeman (who is also amazing as Dr. John Watson on the new BBC series Sherlock and Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy) did an honest and light-hearted, yet believable performance starring as the lead Hobbit, Bilbo. Martins charm and frustration as well as his curiousness of the world outside his hole was  very sincere and real.<br /><br />Ian McKellen (X-Men, God's and Monsters) does what he does best, gives Gandalf a real and passionate tone and feel - making him the true wise man and leader of this band of Dwarfs and one Hobbit. Not unfamiliar with the character, Gandalf, having played him three times before, we now see a more curious and lighter side that makes him a delight to watch.<br /><br />I must give a special nod to Sylvester McCoy (8th Doctor Who, El Dorado) playing Radagst. He is funny, quirky and extremely hyperactive in his efforts of saving the dwarfs and woodland creatures. Sylvester gives his total energy and passion in his performance and rides rabbits like I have never seen before.<br /><br />Now my favorite scene is the scene in the film with Bilbo and Gollum who first meet and go into a battle of wits with each other. Andy Serkis (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Tin Tin), who is never on camera for Freeman's performance one-on-one because Gollum is stop-motion captured, gives a creepy and stunning performance as the once Hobbit gone bad. Andy's humor and duel personality of what Gollum represents is spot on and reminded me most of the original book itself.<br /><br />The film opens with a wonderful showcase of Tolkien veteran characters Frodo and older Bilbo played masterfully by retruening performers Ian Holm (Alien, Fifth Element) and Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, 9) who both have some great scenes together that will warm your heart and memories.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, Captain America) is back as Elrond - head of the Elfans, Cate Blanchett (Aviator, The Missing) is back as the Elfan Galadriel and the ominous Christopher Lee (Phantom Menace, Dark Shadows) is back as the wizard Saruman, although not too prominent as of yet. (Wink, wink.)<br /><br />Howard Shore's (Hugo, Doubt) score is amazing (and there is another review of his score for this film here on this site as well) and it actually evokes a lot of the feeling and passion for the friendships that develop in this film.<br /><br />Hopefully the sequels, `The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' (due in 2013) and `The Hobbit: There and Back Again' (due in 2014) will do what the `Rings' trilogies did, they just became better with each successive film.<br /><br />I think this is defiantly a family friendly film and has a lot of offer the in respect to keeping true to the original novel. Although, I would read the book before and after seeing the film because although the film does give you a perspective of how Peter Jackson was attempting to fill in the story for a two plus hour first film, the book has more meat and depth to it for me. (As all books usually do, of course!) I was slightly disappointed but entertained with the film overall. (However, special note that if you see this in IMAX digital, this film comes with a nine minute preview/trailer of `Star Trek Into Darkness', don't miss that. In my two screenings of `The Hobbit', both with packed sold-out houses, the audience gave more of a response to Star Trek Trailer than Bilbo Baggins.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|The quality is just stunning and absolutely amazing I definitely recommend this app to everyone, the effects are astonishing and dynamic and it's basically like instagram if you think about it, but better
B007MU85D0|5.0|I've played this on repeat for weeks and I'm still going strong. Definitely would buy this album again. and again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I always enjoy finding and saving new ideas for my home. Learning new recipes and great decorating ideas. This is a wonderful thing to have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very exciting sequel to Hunger Games. Can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy and learn the conclusion.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I have a 2 year old and she just loves this game. She gets to fed the pets, play and give them a bath. This is very colorful and fun. I think it may be a little hard for her because she doesn't know how to read yet but she loves playing it anyway.
B00001OH1S|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over and over!  I ordered two...one as a gift and one for home!  Brosnan and Russo at their best!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Did you know that you are dying? I am, too. We all are,I suppose. That is the true equalizing factor of the human race: no matter what we do, or who we are, we cannot escape death. It is the most pervasive disease of society, gnashing it's teeth, swallowing all in its path of destruction.<br /><br />Or is it? Perhaps death IS life. Just another bolt of fabric in the quilt of that beautiful mistress called time. The beauty of this book, though riddled with death, is that it offers the truth of life. Without directly saying it, the book reminds us of what it truly means to be alive.<br /><br />So go live. It's not yet your time to die.
0142418471|5.0|I don't need to write a long review to express this book, it is great for teenagers and I'm so glad I read it.
B0088WJQ1G|3.0|I was looking for something more like the &#34;Once&#34; soundtrack so this was a bit jarring. I bought it on impulse and didn't listen to it first. Not a bad album but I might want to listen to it a few more times to get a better feel for it. Sound quality is fine.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Watched this movie with my 13 y/o son, his 14 y/o friend and the friend's parents (late 40's)  We all laughed continuously through the movie.  Yes, there are a lot of inappropriate things but when you let them accidentally watch the Campaign...this is like Mary Poppins.  Love movies we can all enjoyed and we have all enjoyed it now over and over again!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|just so good. watched the over the week end. Some of my favorite movies. actors are really good. all around great movies
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This game is well worth $1.  It provided a level of entertainment and challenge that I have seldom seen on android games.  I really felt like I was playing mario again (huge compliment).  The final boss was challenging and fun!  Great game.
0761163808|5.0|My daughter received this book for Christmas today and I basically snatched it out of her hands.  What a truly marvelous find!  This is what I imagine the textbooks at Hogwarts might have been.  I would heartily disagree with the 2 star review.  This book is meant to convey animals in motion along with facts.  Please come out with more books like this!  I would buy them all!!!!
1400032717|4.0|I bought this book for school and I gotta say it was very interesting. I was hooked through the whole.book. Learned alot about a disability I didn't even know about
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Absolutely another winner.  This show will continue to win awards for many years.  The actors are wonderful and the shows are never dull!
141659521X|5.0|Another great book.  I love this spy stuff.  But....Mitch needs to soften up a bit.  I'm glad he let Louie go.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is a very interesting character.  We have purchased every season and find them all very entertaining.  Good job Michael!
B005LAIGZU|1.0|This film has one message, and it is painfully obvious: \\"If you're not a SEAL, then you're a piece of ****.\\"<br /><br />As a combat veteran of the US Army Airborne Infantry this movie actually offended me. At no point during the film does anyone acknowledge the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of other people in the service fighting to defend our country. Not a single solitary sentence of dialogue that mentions that there is anyone else out there other than the SEALS.<br /><br />I get it, the SEALS are an elite group and deserve kudos. But I don't think that it is fair to the 18 year old kid on the flight deck working outrageous hours in substandard working conditions to keep our Navy pilots in the air.<br /><br />Next; the plot, dialogue, and action sequences. God forbid a US Navy SEAL does anything other than a perfect one shot between the eyes headshot on a bad guy. Unrealistic, guy takes an RPG to the chest that doesn't explode but gets up and shrugs it off. It is still a rocket coming at you at high speed, I don't care if you are wearing a plate, that is going to do more than knock you down.<br /><br />The ending; the ending was taken directly from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and they do not even attempt to disguise it as anything other than that. If you want to see something worth your time to appreciate the men AND women serving our country you should watch Sebastian Junger's \\"Restrepo\\", or the reality tv show \\"Carrier\\". Unfortunately, the \\"silent professions\\" aren't so silent these days and get way too much credit.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I actually don't like Spartacus, but my husband LOVES it.  That's probably true of most married couples.  It arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.  Thanks!
0345529057|5.0|There seems to be mixed feelings about the quality you get when ordering this set.  Maybe I am lucky, but my set seems to be just fine.  No pages missing, haven't encountered pages tearing or falling out like other reviews.  I am just about done with book one, and have skimmed through the other three just to see if there were any issues.  I didn't see any.  The spine of the book I am reading (Book 1) has some visible wear and tear since I began reading, but I would expect that from a paperback.  I guess if you plan on ordering this set, carfully examine it when you receive it.
1419705849|5.0|I actually haven't read this book, but my Grandson loves all of them and I got him the complete series last year.  I'm sure he will love this one also!
B005JR47R6|5.0|I cannot get enough of House, but Season 8, just like all the other seasons, was awesome. I'd definitely recommend anyone to either buy it or rent it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game entertains me non-stop.  The first packs are pretty easy, but fun none the less.  It's not until I get halfway through the set that I even need to pause to think about what I'm doing.  The best part is that it's so easy to pick up and set down, I can play when I have a spare few minutes, and don't have to worry about getting too involved in the game.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME! This app has so many flaws that it took me a while to figure out all of them; it drops your diamonds that you need to play to force you to buy more...it scams you by giving all one color bubble (say yellow) when you need a different color to win the field (say pink) on purpose and then asks if you would like to continue in that active game it will cost 9 diamonds; but the catch is to get 22 more diamonds it will cost you 99 cents and you can't earn them! And then you have the lighting bolts for each play - you only get 4 or 5 to start but when you run out, it cost diamonds to replenish OR you can wait 30 minutes to earn just one......this app has many design flaws and force-closes multiple times during play.  I just uninstalled this game and DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
0307454568|4.0|I was sorry to see this trilogy end.  I thought the characters were so well drawn, especially Lizbeth Salander.  I think she will be remembered for a long time to come.  They were really page turners, and while the violence was more graphic than I can usually tolerate, it was used in such a way as part of the story that it wasn't offensive.  So sad that Stieg Larsson is gone & cannot give more great reads.  The insights into Sweden & Swedish politics was also very interesting, as I know little about the country.  Great ending for a great series!
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Murakami's 1Q84 is a fantasy for today embedded in the gritty reality of Tokyo. The story gradually spins into another dimension as the elements of fantasy are introduced with great subtlety by a master writer (and credit also for the excellent translation). It's edgy, breathless and sexy as two disparate story threads eventually weave together for the dramatic climax.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|this movie had such bad acting and in my oppinion the worst possible direction they could have taken the bourne storyline.
034580404X|3.0|The first book had a story line but it got to be a bit predictable.. More story line to the sex.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Would give it five stars, but the ENERGY depletes too fast and it takes too long to rebuild without spending money!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|AMAZING!  Susan Boyle AND Michael Crawford?  Who could ask for anything better than that!  I love that Amazon automatically credits for a lower price, too -- that was just icing on the cake!
B009PAETCG|1.0|I thought I would like this game cause I play soccer but it keeps taking me to the app store you shouldn't  get this game
B005HWAOCA|5.0|Wish they had stayed together as they broke up after the 1968 Rhode Island concert, well I think they did two more shows in London. Three key players that each had a different vision of where the band should go. The recording is excellent and the video is very good other than the few weird shots. This brought back my youth!
0425263908|4.0|This book starts almost exactly like 50.  It is easy to get wrapped in and difficult to put down. Gideon and Eva are very complex and almost unhealthy as they develop their roller coaster relationship. The sex is hot, but it is written raw and edgy. I don't see the love and fire that I saw with Christian and Ana. Overall all it was good an I continued hoping that the characters each grow a little and some chemistry/romancing starts
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome app, clean and has advanced features. Perfect. It's. Better then other calculator apps hands down. Big numbers are a huge plus.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is so much better than the first. It give you more to like with the characters, their is some love in the relationship, and you have ups and downs and a little unexpected twist!!!  Now I will compare to 50!  I still wouldn't say I like this better but it is a great book and am mad I am waiting till next year for book three!!
0446691437|5.0|This book literally changed my life. I have read and re-read it multiple times. The ideas Pressfield has come up with has put a name to the things we are all battling as human beings striving to grow. For me this helped me vastly, and for the past few years I have been more productive and in better overall shape than any other point in my life.<br /><br />That being said, this book is a little off the beaten path in the way it approaches things. It's like your friend coming up to you and insisting you try holistic medicine or hot yoga or Buddhism. If you try it you'll either buy right into it or say that it's some crazy stuff. But if you do buy into it, this will be one the best books you have ever purchased. Isn't the $12 worth the risk?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such a phenomenal trilogy. Spellbound. Couldn't put the books down for 3 days. Will definitely be reading again. Wish there was more!
B005Z28M58|5.0|Excellent product!<br />E x c e l l e n t  c o n d i t i o n!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Oh my goodness, this is by far one of my favorite apps on my Kindle. It's so simple to use and can be used for many things. It doesn't take up a lot of space either. I think the last time I used a piece of paper to take motes in my classes was a few weeks ago. I haven't used a piece of notebook paper for taking notes in a while ever since I got this app. I use it mostly for PreAP World History, English II PreAP, Art, Chemistry PreAP, and Geometry PreAP. I love this app!
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Dark City is an inquiry into identity. What makes a person a person? Are we but a collection of memories and experiences?<br /><br />I thought the characters of John Murdock, Emma, Dr. Schrieber, Inspector Bumstead, and the Strangers were vivid and memorable.<br /><br />The costumes, the sets, the acting, all of it, is good or great. The Stranger's costumes in particular, deserve special mention for their Gothic quality.<br /><br />I watch it least once a year, and I always enjoy it. I like the additional material for the Director's Cut, as well.<br /><br />Too bad I missed seeing it in the theater...<br /><br />There is an interesting story about the name of Kiefer Sutherland's character, \\"Dr. Daniel Paul Schreber\\", which can be found in [[ASIN:094032220X Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (New York Review Books Classics)]]<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this captivating, darkling science fiction.<br /><br />If you liked the original Dark City, I am quite sure you will enjoy the Director's Cut added footage and features, even more.
1608871452|5.0|Exactly what a fan of the show would fervently desire to have to complete or start their collection, A must have!
B000274THQ|5.0|Moving story about a son who tries to maintain the illusion that the GDR is still going, when his mother wakes up from a coma, after The Wall fell.<br /><br />It's hard to articulate why this movie was so touching. I am not usually into politics or comedy, yet I found this movie to be thoughtful, heartfelt, and engrossing.<br /><br />Very insightful into the culture of the German Democratic Republic. Well worth watching.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This awesome woman just keeps giving us beautiful music. I think you will enjoy this CD. She is wonderful in every way.
B00785P2QC|3.0|not nearly as good as the other virtual citys but still a fun way to relax and have fun. I play these games to waste time and have fun playing.
0812550706|1.0|This book left me feeling awful. How the kids were treated was sickening-even the adult characters in the book thought it was sickening. I wanted so badly to see the character grow with his age but it never happens. No morals, virtues or honor to be gained from this story! The story lacks direction and climax. Drones on and on in some parts...in other parts as quickly as it gains your attention, it extinguishes it. Horrible book for kids to read-especially considering all the crap going on with the shootings in Connecticut! I would ban this book from kids if I could.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|I didn't have any expectations when I sat down to watch this.  Emma came through with another very enjoyable film version of a book.  I have to admit that I did secretly wish for a glimpse of a soft side to her.  Stiff upper lip and all that.  That being said it is a very nice story and a nice way to teach proper behavior.
B008MM9630|5.0|sweet game I would play this game forever. I like hownit updates itself too. but gameloft games are better but they need more free games too. plz and thank u
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Seeing this on DVD is sooo much better than VCR version,(Of course what isn't?)  This is one of our family's favorite and I am very glad to be able to see it again.  Especially with the clean look of DVD format.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This was the first book I've read by Ellen and it had me rolling on the floor, laughing out loud, literally.  I had to buy her other books because I enjoyed this one so much.  She is a very funny person.
B003L20IJM|4.0|Good plot line.  Simple and direct, good for younger children.  A nice way to teach behavior in a fun and enjoyable way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Most puzzles are very quick. I do enjoy this game a lot and  sometimes the answers aren't do obvious. Worth trying!
0307352145|2.0|Essentially it's a mismatch in expectations. I was drawn to the book by its very promising title and very important subject matter. The book has provided much material in showing how and where this group has completed a world dominated by the extroverts like how wasabi was to sushi, but i have known these stories throughout my life.<br /><br />I have expected better insights, even academic, for example on how introverts and extroverts behave under different scenario. I would suggest Ms Cain to back the book on established psychological literature to give more depth.<br /><br />More importantly, I have expected the book to be more ambitious in challenging the extrovert ideal, not just providing tips and tricks to survive the prevailing reality. For example, instead of telling us introverts are potentially better bosses, the author could have researched much more on how introverts could rise to manage a group of extroverts, if throughout the book the author kept saying that introverts were ignored by the extroverts. I am an introvert, I am struggling in the world of extrovert, but i am not contended with the status quo, and i have expected more from the book.<br /><br />All in all, a very good try but Ms Cain need to put (way) more meat onto the skeleton. It has the potential to be ranked among the must-haves in psychological studies, but this is still a far cry.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is currently my granddaughters' favorite movie.  I can't really review it other than to review their enjoyment which was priceless.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Gather your friends for a ladies night in.  Very entertaining and the story line is not bad either. And the boys are hot hot hot!
B009FZFONO|5.0|by far the best show on tv! cant wait to see the rest of season 3 in february! love it!!!
076115728X|5.0|My son loves this book when he was 2yrs old and it was his favorits. So, now I have to buy it again. It is samll book so they can carry it easily and they had fun with it.
B002OT730K|4.0|What raises the record above the usual Stones cash-in live album, is the first quarter (or side one in old money), which is record in a small club with the band playing old blues tracks.<br />If the entire album have been recorded like this it would have been one of the all time great live records, oh well, missed opportunities.<br />You do also, have interesting versions of tracks such as \\"Get off of my Cloud\\", \\"Star Star\\" & \\"You can't always get want\\", which are played with real enthusiasm.<br />The only real problem, is that the concert is taken from their \\"Black & Blue\\" tour, whereas as the following \\"Some Girl\\" gigs would have been an much more satisfying experience.<br />So \\"Love you live\\" & \\"Get your Ya Ya's out\\" are probably the only live Stones albums worth spending your money at the time of writing, unless you're a obsessive Fan who must own every single one of their releases.
1579128149|5.0|This is very well written and visually stunning; I particularly enjoyed the information on the various uses for each element. It's an excellent book for any collection.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I liked the pacing and the character interchanges. The ending was terrific. I enjoyed getting to know the characters and the love affair was both believable and fun. I'd recommend it.
0937381888|5.0|All you have to know to brew beer rigth since the first time, and its true, you should try it...
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Not much to review....it's a DVD/BR combo movie. However, it's a great movie and my daughter loves it.<br />Can't put a price on happy children.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Shipped fast and i love this product. Shipped fast and i love this product. Shipped fast and i love this product. Shipped fast and i love this product.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Great case. Does it's job. It really holds it in there and the strap for your hands comes in hand also.
0439023491|1.0|I ordered this Book from Silver Arch Book's. The book I received was in terrible shape. It had writing inside of it on three pages. It was also once a Library Book. Also I ordered it thinking the book cover would be on it, and it wasn't. It was very disappointing! I ordered it as a gift for my son, and now I will spend more time and MONEY to buy him a copy that has no damage to the pages. It is a shame that what I, the customer, am ordering is not what I receive. I will never order from Silver Arch Book's again and I urge other's to heed this statement and do that same. I do understand I am ordering a book online, but when I am expecting something different as per your ITEM description states, it become's not about the book itself but the integrity of the company from whom I am ordering it!
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I am a big fan of Ellie. Though ultimately I don't know if I like this album as much as her debut, I am a big fan, and think that this is a great sophomore record. Love the music, and lyrics! Great album all around.
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|It is a view into the mind of a mad man and explains in detail his hatred of Jews and other &#34;inferior&#34; classes. Compare the rants with some current world leaders and it's easy to connect the dots. Nothing like broadcasting what you are going to do and have no one believe it.
1594745692|5.0|Awesome. Really cool and a second order of these made a great gift!<br />illustration style of retro zombies is a total unique twist.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Let the UN take over and this book may come to pass. Societies seem to require a blood sacrifice and it makes good entertainment just like the Gladiator Games in Rome. But this time, the producers have special effects to add to the mix.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|I liked it when I saw it online. And love it more when I got it. It feels good and looks so cute!
B00008YJHC|5.0|Excellent album. Came shipped fine too. Thanks again for a great CD. I think it was the Pixies albums. Cheers!
B006YC74E8|4.0|Have only played with it briefly but from what I have seen so far, it's a great app for droid.
B006T5C5PS|4.0|Great read if you or someone you love is sick or has cancer. The actual jucing for the regular joe would be quite a challenge, extremely time consuming and expensive.
B001IF277K|4.0|Compré esta bateria y llevo usandola 3 dias y hasta ahora todo va bien, espero que dure lo suficiente antes de que la retiren del mercado
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great Fun and still presents a challenge. I like the options that are presented with this game. And the availabilty to increase the difficulty or not with the tools that are included with this game.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to hear all of Mozart's piano concertos. I loaded it onto my iPod Shuffle so that I could listen while I walked my laps at the hospital cardiac center and at the mall when I am shopping. I turn up the volume to shut out local noises and music. When I listened to Beethoven's piano concertos, I found them beautifully written for slower walking. These require me to keep pace and accomplish my walking exercise faster.<br /><br />The music is clear and distinctive. From my point of view, an excellent choice.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Spoiler! This movie takes place in the Black Hills of South Dakota after Lt. Colonel George Custer announces the finding of gold and sets off the gold rush. The government decides that the Indians are pesky obstacles in the way of getting to the gold and need to be dealt with and forcibly if necessary. Custer does his best to destroy the Indians but is defeated at the Battle of Little Big Horn.<br /><br />&#34;Avatar 2&#34; will deal with the Indians being forcibly relocated to reservations without the possibility of creating casinos.<br /><br />Okay, ignoring all of that, the movie can be enjoyed for its stunning visual effects and that is, after all, why we want to watch it in 3D.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Its came in perfect condition, my sister is gonna love it, i hope. Its also a good movie for laughs.
1931559317|5.0|I do visual variable star measurements and after dealing with the complexity of my sky chart software and the overly simple two other atlases that I have this fits the bill perfectly.  It shows magnitude to 7.6.  It you still enjoy looking at a star chart rather than messing with a go-to scope you might want to give this atlas a try.  I think particularly it is well-suited for advanced amateurs too who are looking for the lesser-known deep-sky objects.
1416972242|5.0|I would rate this book 5. I got this book for my daughter as a Christmas gift because she had the 1st book and wanted the other books that followed. She absolutely loved the 1st book that is why i got her this book.
B009FXIICK|2.0|I thought it would be a really cool game but turns out that the graphics are stupid and confusing. Hope they fix it

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter to use with her photography clients. She said it is just what she needed for close range portraits. I would recommend this for short range photos.
B008L1VZS6|5.0|King for a Day is a catchy romp along standard plot lines. It has some gems here and there but some gross in this uneven score. Previous reviewers have given us a look at the inflictions that were occuring at the time of composing of this early Verdi. The have related the dark circumstances that beset our young composer at the time of writing this frilly comedy when he was suffering one tragic event after another. That he could produce such a light and subtle score under such circumstances is all the more remarkable. The end product is not brilliant but a fun romp. The light glittering touch of Rossini is missing, the natural and instictive structuring of the comic Donizetti is not quite there but this opera is a joy to watch and watch again. The reason for the success of this production is the truly excellent cast. For me the star of this show is that sophisticated sovereign of the operatic stage, Anna Caterina Antonacci. I've seen her in at least a dozen roles, her breath-taking Cassandra, her magnificent Ermione, her frightening Medea,all serious, all superb. This is my first view her comic talents and they are considerable. Her partner to be and the false king for a day is majestic baritone Guido Loconsoto. To me the best section of the opera is their Act II duetto \\"Ch'io non possa il ver comprendere?\\" and the following recitativo, scena ed aria. This section has true polished comedic structure; a delight for the eye and the ear. The ingenue love interest is the Guiletta of Alessandra Marianelli who has the Roberta Peters part, direct and charming is her soubrette of a role. Her consort is Ivan Magri of thin tenor but a fine singer who bleets on occasion. The first act finale is somewhat weak (never really takes off)but the opera ends with a fine settimino and finale that brings a smile to each face in the audience. Fragile yes, but fun all around.<br />P.S. Sarasota Opera (Florida U.S.A.)is performing \\"Un Giorno di Regno\\" in February and March 2013.
B001LF347E|4.0|I adore Merlin, but we definitely had some glitches in this DVD set. The discs were I damaged but they somehow had not been able to get the Us region's format correct. By the third season, these glitches are gone. I still recommend owning this, the story and acting is terrific, enchanting, full of action, adventure, romance, humor and plenty of magic as Merlin begins to discover his gifts. Plot twists abound. Merlin's humility to his Arthur is also a great lesson of this generation... One doesn't need to be in the spotlight to do great good and change the course of life for the better.
B009CPE424|2.0|Ordered this for my daughter who loved the original Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie.  This one was okay - but not nearly as good as the original and even Part 2.  Actors were different and the story line was just not good.  My daughter did not want to watch it again and usually she will watch movies over and over.  It would make a cute rental if you just want to watch it one time.  But don't waste your money purchasing the DVD.
1423140605|5.0|While I'm sad this series was only three books long, I loved the way it was written in the Kane's tape recorded voices. The third book was e wry bit as good as the first two, but I do so wish the author had wanted to continue  exploring Egyptian mythology. This book was packed with all of the emotion, drama, adventure and action that characterized the first two, as well as the unique humor or teens, captured perfectly by Riordan. Especially appreciated using multi-ethnic main characters, giving our teens relatable characters with the collateral experience of diversity. I hope some day he will return to the rich mythology and history of Egypt.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love all the Marvel Movies.  Collected all of them.  Loved the part where the Hulk turned Loki into a Rag Doll in Tony Stark's Building.  Hulk walks away and says &#34;Puinie God&#34;  another part was after Hulk and Thor were fighting bad guys and stood next to each other and Hulk punched Thor and he went flying across the room.
1933633867|5.0|took me 4 months to finally finish this book. Though historical in review, it mixes in religious, social, as well as the financial burden of debt

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|No lengthy review from me, I watched and was entertained.  I like these type of movies because I just want to escape reality for a few hours and I was not disappointed.  I recommend this movie to anyone.
B0086700CM|1.0|I never really liked this game from the begining, someone on facebook said they like it better than Angry Birds, i couldnt disagree more
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty shades darker is a really good read. It was filled with love, passion, mystery, and anticipation. It kept me on the edge of ny seat.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have played this game A LOT since downloading it. it really brings you in more than i ever expected!
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|Kids love this movie! I only wish it was the dvd and Blu ray combo so we can take it with us on a trip
B004G6009K|5.0|Great  equipment would definitely buy again. Works like a dream.  Nothing to dislike about this product.  Look for more  like it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Entertaining game, entertaining story,  beautiful graphics and action sequences. LOVE the animals! Always good to have a monkey as a BFF. Good value for the $.

1451613512|4.0|I am a fairly educated man, some forty years of 'post' high school higher learning. Although, I've taken no degrees as such I think I'm able to discern 'pro' from 'con', 'truth' from untruth' 'faith' (in anything) from 'unfaith'. So, okay, what does all that mean to anyone? Who cares what I think. I'm just another number in the 'Federal Databank' -- a databank, by the way, which includes everyone in this country plus a few others -- whose complete history has been deposited by each and every Internet or cell user (You, Me, and the Donkey nextdoor), freely given to the entity some call 'Big Brother'.<br /> So, the lesson here is, 'If you don't want anyone to know who or what you do it's easy: don't go online. The only way to escape is to throw away everything that has anything to do with communication, grow a beard, go completely offgrid and live off the land. Oh, I can hear it now, 'but we can't do that because we ... we....well, we just can't....!<br /> Well, that's what happens when you read this book: You can't put it down until you've finished it, because ... because ... well, just because.<br /><br />I could say I never read anything like it but that would be a lie. I've read thousands of books that have come up way short of their supposed thesis'. This is the only book I've read that has come anywhere near what it purports to be, 'The Untold History of the United States'. And what a history it is. The people depicted in the 'Oliver Stone' and 'Peter Kusnick' book are probably wishing that they had lived offgrid and in another life. But, as you know, or should know, their lives are open books, especially now with the advent of 'global information'.<br /> Never before have people been open to such scruitiny. My 'belief' system in a few of them was completely torn asunder. Oh, I had my doubts about history like many others, but this book nailed those doubts into a 'coffin' of total erasure and opened another 'coffin of hypocracy'. Revelations abound. Lies screamout at you as though you were there witnessing the very accounts. From the Sanctomonious Priest to the lowly Peasant; from the lying Congressman to his Constituents; from the smiling and vacuous President to his conniving Cabinet, it's all here, and dutifully researched beyond argument.<br /> This work should serve as a 'necessary' adjunct to every classroom in America. It's thesis remains to be proven, BUT, that can only be done by the American People in picking the correct route to follow. Many roadblocks and detours stand in the way. Read this book, and, maybe, just maybe we can push the roadblocks aside and connect the detours to a path that leads us to a 'True Freedom' for all the world's<br />peoples and repression for none.<br /><br />As usual Amazon's delivery was excellent - Actually received it a day before scheduled delivery. Great service..!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed only loads a handful of posts, so this app is pretty much usless!!!!!  If I could give fewer than 1 star, I would!
B008MYYODK|4.0|UPDATED<br /><br /> Every recording in this box is an excellent pick from the early years of Bayreuth.<br /><br /> Most are taken from the fifties when Varnay, Modl, Hotter, Nilsson, Windgassen, etc., ruled. As well as the 4-Ks...Knappertsbusch, Keilberth, Krauss and Karajan.<br /><br />For those who unfortunately do not have these will discover a vast Wagnerian treasure and will wallow in some of the greatest opera performances ever caught 'live' on the Bayreuth stage. The Ring recordings alone are worth the price of the set. Transfers are good and the excerpts will allow the listener to sample other productions from the years of great Wagnerian singing.<br /><br />The earliest recordings from 1904 will demonstrate how singers were instructed to sing Wagner, perhaps from Cosima Wagner herself, in the true Wagner tradition of that era. Fortunately, that era has passed. A bad case of the nerves seem to trouble a few of these singers. Interesting, though.<br /><br />Some of the excerpts are in stereo as well as the three complete recordings of Lohengrin, Der Fliengende Hollander and Gotterdammerung. The stereo recordings are excellent but there seems to be no movement of singers or separation of instruments in the orchestra. All is stationary. No doubt tapes from a radio archive were used.<br /><br />There is a radio Meistersinger with von Karajan conducting in '51 Bayreuth circulating along with the same production edited by EMI. That is probably the case here. The complete radio production sounds better and has the same cast. The Meistersinger in this box sounds much better than the EMI. The Parsifal is a real prize along with 2-discs of excerpts from various outings.<br /><br />I love this set and have taken it off the shelf more often than other Wagner collections.<br /><br />In conclusion, one of the minor disappointments I find on these budget sets, from Membran products especially, are the irritating  signs stamped on the front or sides of their boxes. You know, the big '10 CD Set' logo or '140 CDs!' It just looks cheap and like a ploy to sell boxes. Why destroy a nice looking presentation like this? Just curious. But it's the music that is important in the long run., the big '10 CD Set' logo or '140 CDs!' It just looks cheap and like a ploy to sell boxes. Why destroy a nice looking presentation like this? Just curious. But it's the music that is important in the long run.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|I rented this because I thought it was a light comedy, it is more of a drama with some jokes in it....
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It seems very good but I wish it didn't bring up the app every time I plug my phone in.
1430233834|3.0|only if u like dorkey gamimg, and are not a beginner, found errors in the code as well. Good luck,
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I love every song on this CD and that's usually not the case. Each song could have been a number one hit!
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|Initially I rented &#34;The Rum Diary&#34; from redbox. I liked the movie so much I had to add it to my collection. Some great laughs and scenery.
0062082353|5.0|I got this for my husband and he said he really enjoyed it.I was glad I got it for him. Thank you!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My children and child clients LOVE this game!  It is fun and addicting and the kids fight to see who can get the farthest with the little jetpack guy, and they all get excited when they get one of the items that change the jetpack guy, especially the dragon.  I like that it isn't too long, so it encourages them to share and no one has to be waiting too long for a turn.
B009JBZH54|5.0|this came very quickly, well before the estimated arrival date. very happy with my purchase! the packaging was perfect and the set was well protected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I could do this game all day, and I have gotten my kids into it to.  It requires planning and critical thinking, but each board doesn't take a very long time, so it can be quick as well.
0385366752|5.0|You hate and love both characters at different times, and sometimes you disliked them both, always keeping it interesting. I couldn't stop listening to this and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I also loved the narrators, who added an additional element to the book.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great for doing puzzles and for downloading new images.  It can be difficult to organize the pieces on smaller screens, but with being able to choose your difficulty, it works well.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|its awesome need to be able to move around screen<br />  better!  getting into it a lot! hope. more to come
B0015DROBO|3.0|I thought long and hard whether to rate this book with 2 stars or 3. I ended up with a 3 because at the end of the book I suppose I was glad I had stomached the overwhelmingly boring first half of the story and made it to the good part. There were some things that where quite repetetive to the point of absurdity, such as the main character's apparent obsession with coffee, but I gave the author the benefit of the doubt. Maybe everyone in Sweden drinks coffee 20 times a day and at all hours. It isn't a major flaw, I know, but it was in my opinion very much overdone. But things like that were just small nuances that I can do my best to overlook. The main thing that I absolutely hated about this book was the family history. That part was so boring it made my teeth hurt. Granted some history was necessary to the story line but I think it went way too far back and too far out to be of any interest or purpose to the overall story. The point could have been made with far less droning on about his father and his father's brothers and their cousins and the seconds cousin's nephew once removed who moved to America and isn't even part of the plot. Also the author went a little overboard in the telling of his daily business and routines. A healthy amount of that type of thing is nice to make the character feel real but I feel like it was just too much.<br /><br />In summary, there were a good many low points to this book, but I feel like it still deserves a 3 star rating because once the story gets moving it is easier to get excited about the plot and ignore the annoying, repetetive details.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is great everything is cheap if not u can earn money quick buying animals yay they get acuter everytime they level up U WILL LUV THIS its even for little kids 3-14
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Thought we'd try out Amazon streaming again after being disappointed a year ago.  Netflix and Hulu can stream without stopping but the Amazon video pauses often.  We only have a 1Mbps link so most people won't experience this, but if you don't have 2Mbps+, pass on Amazon streaming until they offer better streaming to PCs and PS3.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I open it up and click on some of the sounds and it said sorry it in not working. I have trouble sleeping and it justs makes me want to throw it across the room.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|A magical film with wonderful dancing in two genres.  Although &#34;dated&#34; because it is pre 1990's in Soviet Russia, its aliveness and excitement carry one along to the very end.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is hard and has a challenge. it is well on not glitching up. also, it is so fun. I love the charecters and all the extra stuff.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Many people have thought that there was sensitive information released in this book but I found nothing that aappreared to be classified.  First hand information is much better that the tripe put out by the political people.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I was enthralled by the love story and was devastated by the death, but loved the twist at the end
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This headset was shipped fast and is a very good product. I would definately recomment this product to anyone else.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Tremendous!! This is the kind of book that gets a person turned on to reading! I couldn't wait to get home from work bury myself in this story. Enjoyable is a mundane word to describe how wonderful this book is. To put in perspective - if the author wrote toilet paper ads, I would read them. He can weave a hell of a tale…..wonderful, wonderful.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game. Already finished all the levels.  Love the monkeys and the music.  I hope they add more levels in the future.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Without a doubt, this is a refreshing chick flick! I love it, it´s one fo my favorite movies ever!! I get it to watch it when I´m just pampering myself at home xD
B009JBZH54|5.0|With all the things this comes with is a great bargain<br />5 bluerays, the 3 movies with 2 discs dedicated to extra features, and the booklet is awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B00062PN6I|2.0|I know that Behringer offers a wide range of products, some of better quality than others. I was hoping that these headphones would surprise me. They did not. The sound quality is below par -- even with headphones purchased for $10 at the local Odd Lots store. These are comfortable, but that's about the extent of the favorable rating I can give. The sound is &#34;muddy.&#34; There's very little clarity in any frequency. It just sounds &#34;thick.&#34; The plastic is low-grade. Overall, I'm disappointed. I have used several Behringer products. Most are great bargains. Don't bother with these cans.
B0089IGUP4|4.0|This album signifies all that music needs to be articulately written with such emotion. This is their best album, In my opinion. Handwritten is an album of worthy stature. If you're a fan, I recommend it. If you're new to the band, You can also benefit from it as well. It might take awhile to get into it, But there are some really powerful songs on the album that anyone with heart can relate to. Handwritten, The song, Is my favorite song by Gaslight. Brings tears and moves me to such great heights.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found myself very absorbed in the story and wanted to see how things developed so I kept reading and found it hard to put the book down.  Although I found that I did not particularly like to read so much sex, I kept reading to find out how it would end.
B002APU580|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I watch it literally every time it comes on tv. My friend just so happened to need to watch it for a school project so I rented it for him. It worked out perfectly. It was soo easy to do !
0345802934|5.0|Beautiful box set of three books. Great condition, speedy shipping, I am very satisfied. But of course what makes this book so great is Murakami's imaginative story.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The amazon instant movie service is a good one, although I still do like to have a copy written optical disk of my media (this was just a rental).  The movie left me wanting story line.  I really liked most of the effects, but the fight scenes were pretty fake.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I had this remote stolen from me by workers that came into my house to do work. I had to replace it, so Amazon was the cheapest!
B008I34XX6|5.0|i purchased this movie for a close friend,and it is his favorite movie of all. Peter O'toole is excellent. GoHastings is also a good seller
B000OMD4BG|5.0|This is one great, two disc compilation of some of Elliott's most impressive songs. The early version of &#34;Miss Misery&#34; alone is worth the purchase, but this is loaded with other classics such as &#34;Going Nowhere&#34; and &#34;Go By&#34; that have the ability to put you in a trance and leave you wanting more.
B007Q6XIMI|4.0|Not as deep, immersive and over the map as Trainspotting, but any additional stories from these characters is always much appreciated. Excellent. About on par with Porno but without the Hollywood happy ending.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. Now if they could just create a &quot;pin it&quot; button that works like it does on the computer, it would be perfect.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|What can you say, The Dark Knight Returns was a classic. The video is a good shot at it, but I will wait until part two for my full recommendation.
B003EV6DBW|1.0|The sound did not work . I replaced  it the sound still did not play on the second blue ray disk. I have used other blue ray discs on my player, they woked . Amazon has a bad batch of this title on this product.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|I love this movie and most especially the book it came from - Ayn Rand's classic \\"The Fountainhead\\".  Ayn Rand was actively involved in getting this film to the screen, including writing the screenplay.  A great book, as always, is better than a movie made from it can ever be.  Today rational self-interest is increasingly thought of as evil while tribalism, or group think, is praised as superior.  This movie can help inspire people to live happy self-directed lives, to think, to rely on reason rather than emotion.  The movie was made in the late 40s so the style, including the acting, are not what we are accustomed to today but perhaps that's actually an asset since this movie's content is so totally different than the trash and disdain for individualism that is dished out today.  This movie celebrates the individual!  Enjoy - Then read the book!
1439152802|5.0|Great novel, favorite author- all of her novels are very different and it was a fantastic read! WRITE MORE KATE
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I was looking for something to help me connect my fire to my wifi more consistently.  When I first started the application I was presented with a graphic display of my wifi and all the signals in the neighborhood.  I was delighted and surprised.  Get it now.  :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got this for my husband and it arrived promptlly and in excellent condition.I know he will love it for Christmas
B009LL4LMM|3.0|good game pretty good puzzle game to mess around with when bored  makes you think to move forward and is a lot of trial and error
B005LAII1C|2.0|I expected Ted to be funny.  I got bored half way through and did not watch the movie to the end. I found this movie annoying, in your face and unsubtle. From the excessive dope smoking, swearing, crudeness, immaturity, self absorbance, just another Bro-mance tween movie....a lazy movie, not witty at all. I like the concept of the movie yet the product is another terrible Hollywood comedy. Shame, Mark Wahlberg has been is some really great movies (The Departed for one and more). This just wasn't one of them.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this game is highly addictive i played for almost 3-4 days straight till i beat it, and i will probably install again to play
B009E3EY38|5.0|Again, WOW!<br />Best Blu Ray I own. Gread CD's and the Bonus dvd is fun too. I recommend this to any Zeppelin fan!
B004GVUPFE|3.0|this is a decent game, not good but not bad not something i have spent a lot of time in
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|The show is awesome and so is the music.  I wish the soundtrack would have included &#34;Fade Into You&#34;, but they did include &#34;Wrong Song&#34; which is one of my favorites.  Overall I'm pleased with it.
B008458O3S|4.0|great game to play but can be kinda hard to use if you are color blind they have a color blind mode but if you are trying to merge the trains like you need it can be hard being color blind
B0024FAR5M|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SHOW AROUND RIGHT NOW, IT IS WELL WRITTEN AND KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.  IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY, TOUCH YOUR HEART AND SCARE THE SHEEOTT OUT OF YOU ALL AT THE SAME TIME.<br />THIS IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY TO HAVE THE SET ON HAND TO WATCH ON A BORING WEEKEND AND TO CATCH UP ALL OVER AGAIN BEFORE THE NEW SEASON STARTS.  THE ONLY THING I HATE IS IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE ALWAYS ON BREAK....THEY HAVE 10 SHOWS THEN THEY ARE OFF UNTIL NEXT SEASON 2 MONTHS ON 10 MONTHS OFF AND I 'HATE WAITING'  I NEED MY JACKS!!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|decent game, hard to play sometimes but it can get pretty good best if you have nothing to really do though
1442355476|5.0|Have not listened to book yet.  We are driving to Florida in early January and we are looking forward<br />to listening to it then.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|got on a free day not too bad but not something i have really played or even tried to mess with
B000MXPE74|5.0|I'm ashamed of myself for discovering this band six years after their debut album was first published. But.....Wow!!! Each and every song seems to draw off something from a different era and in a good way. It sounds influenced not recycled. Jon's voice is an awesome throw back to the British Invasion (although he's Scottish) and more than half the songs on the album make me think to myself &#34;the Beatles might've written this if they were just starting out today&#34;. Ok maybe most of the lyrics are about girls but they're still clever and original the way they're written. There isn't one song that makes me want to hit the skip button. Costello Music is instantly one of my all time favorite albums. I hope they come back to New York because I'd love to see them live now that I'm actually aware of them. Damn!! How did this band fly under my musical radar for so long?
B0085MNZ66|1.0|happy i did not pay for this game, it does not work on my phone at all and i can not even try it out
B0043GAZYS|5.0|The item shipped fast and was just as described. It is a great movie and I love all the extra footage and commentary.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|great game to play once you get used to the new features and such it gets just as good as the original.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Love the action in this movie. Not as fast paced as the trilogy, but Jeremy Renner does the Bourne movie justice. Hope they do another.
B0085YNML2|4.0|i haven't started playing the game just yet so not a full review but it looks good and i cant wait to actually play it
0857685848|5.0|This is quite simply a stunning book, full of gorgeous pictures. I liked that the emphasis of this book was not so much on the dinosaurs as it was on the people bringing them to life. We already have so many books out there telling us anything we could want to know about the animals themselves; it's always nice to get a feel for other aspects of paleontology (in this case, the people and processes involved in artistic reconstructions). I deeply admire all the artists presented, and think they are all excellent at what they do: my one criticism of the book is that I think it has a very poor representation of Luis V. Rey's work. I think he is an excellent artist, but the pieces here don't quite do him justice. I much prefer his pre-digital paintings, and a few of his pieces presented in the book actually look a little sloppy (a particular offender being the T-rex vs. Triceratops, where you can clearly differentiate some of the Photoshop layers, making it look like a cheap green-screen SFX). Overall though, I cannot sing enough praises of everyone involved in the making of this volume. Hopefully we get a second collection sometime in the near future that includes all the artist's who weren't able to fit this time around!
B008KE3960|3.0|good game for a moba game very interesting when you learn how to play and get used to and  into the system.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The worst part of reading a Vince Flynn book is that it is over so quickly and then there is another year of anticipating the next.
B008NABUU8|3.0|good game plays like almost every bridge builder not really anything new to report here but a solid game none the less
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I could not have published my first book without this handy little guide next to my laptop. It had important formatting info which I needed. Agree with an earlier comment that it is not exhaustive. I needed to know what Font and Size to type my manuscript in for best conversion results, and could only get that info (Times Roman, 12pt) by emailing the Support Team.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|If you like Nicki Minaj, then you'll love this album.  It was the perfect blend of old mixtape Nicki, with new mainstream Nicki and I loved it. Punchlines were crazy, hooks were catchy, and I can't wait for the next album.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|the game is great, but there's way too many ads. it interferes with gameplay. an ad will pop up right in the middle of a launch and completely mess you up. take out some ads please.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I am not a fan of chick flicks.  I am not a fan of the movie everybody else loves.  But I cannot help loving this movie.  If crafting on a love story was what it took to bring a modern, big-budget special effects version of a Titanic movie out, so be it.  I've been a Titanic .... fan?  can we be fans of disasters? ... since I caught a late-night showing of A Night To Remember on TV.  I would have slept through the next day of fourth grade except I was abuzz with thoughts of CDQ vs. SOS, watertight compartments, and all the large and small decisions that led to the disaster.  So, yes, I was agog at the detail of the film.  And ya know what?  The love story isn't so bad.
B009QW7MQS|4.0|I have watched this movie several times (twice on Amazon Instant Video), partly because of my hunger for the closed captions so I know what the dialogue is, partly because I think the pre-credit opener is stunning, and partly because I'm amazed by both Judi Dench's and Michele Yeoh's performances in this film. The film is really pretty standard Bond stuff with a villain and plot both lacking any sense of authenticity. What catches my attention is that we see \\"M\\" actively seeking to influence decisions by her political masters. Not only does she dispense missions to Bond and send him around the world in the field, she seeks to influence the outcome of the mission at the political level. She is fully involved in the mission in this sense, unlike the male \\"M\\" who is far more passive but who still expects a result from Bond.<br /><br />When I first saw Michele Yeoh perform in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", I viewed her as an extremely intelligent, artistic person with a warrior's spirit and a skill with the weapons of that time to match. I wonder why she had to perform in a Bond film? It would seem so dull and lacking a depth of plot for her. Instead of building her own unique genre of films, she is another Bond girl. To understand this better, suppose Chuck Norris was offered a role in this film instead of Yeoh. Would he be likely to accept? No, it would distract from his own image as an ultratough dispenser of justice to deeply nasty villains. Yeoh is a more refined Chuck Norris, who still recognizes the need to stop the evil she is witnessing. In this film, she never gets an intellectual or emotional challenge. Her role is very different than it was in Crouching Tiger. It doesn't come through as a plausibly good fit for her.<br /><br />I enjoy watching this movie tremendously. It lacks any sense of realistic action, but it is fun!<br /><br />Besides rating the movie, I'd like to rate delivery of the movie to my viewing hardware. For the first playing of this movie on Amazon Instant Video, I connected my MacBook Pro to an Apple 27\\" LED Display, and connected an ethernet cable from the MacBook to my network switch in order to stream the video. I did this on a Sunday evening, which might influence Amazon's delivery of the movie since one might expect there will be many more viewers than usual on Amazon's network on a Sunday night. It turned out that the connection quality for much of the film was poor. Images were very grainy at times. Perhaps trying to play a movie on my 27\\" monitor was a problem for my hardware. Also at times, the video would inexplicably stop streaming. At first I thought this might be my own fault. Perhaps my FiOS router/access point simply can't handle such a steady flood of data. That seems a bit silly though. Or perhaps my router is dropping connections. But now I'm thinking that perhaps Amazon's content delivery is the problem. Maybe it has a tough time handling the load on it during weekends. I don't know. I then watched this movie a second time, from the beginning, on a Monday evening. I did not use my 27\\" monitor but rather played it on my MacBook's LCD screen. Not only did I experience really great streaming performance, the images looked fantastic! So perhaps watching video on weekday evenings is a better deal.on Amazon Instant Video, I connected my MacBook Pro to an Apple 27\\" LED Display, and connected an ethernet cable from the MacBook to my network switch in order to stream the video.

B000002OOY|5.0|I don't have a lot to say about the quality of the recordings or the selection of the tracks.  I simply love the music.  That's why I bought it.  On the other hand, if you're not a fan of the film, I don't know that there's enough here to make you buy it.  For me, soundtracks are like postcards: mostly I get them to remind me of something.<br /><br />Best wife ever: she let me use the Jurassic Park theme as our wedding processional.  So, yes, 5 stars.  :)
B008602KQI|5.0|It's not what I expected it to be.  It was better!  A different story line.  Great cast.  It keeps you guessing all through.  And you certainly look forward to a Sequal.  Watch it.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I am not a big Will Farrell fan.  I don't particularly enjoy over-the-top humor (rarely laugh out loud).  Yet, this movie cracks me up every time.  There is great music, creative story, great acting, and physical comedy all contained in this film.  It has become a must-see event for my family every year and if you haven't given it a try, I would recommend doing so.  (Pretty much anything Bob Newhart is in has to be good)<br /><br />Fun and poignant at the same time.  Perfect.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game will keep you playing for weeks at a time. Better than number 4 for sure. Buy it ASAP
B008N9AAQ4|1.0|I assume the video has not yet been released. The advertise made it seem worth the time to wait. So, I will review when it comes.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|70+ hours in and I'm still addicted!  Excellent voice acting and story.  The game play mechanics are easy to pick up.  Learning curve is a bit high though but once you get into it, you'll be hooked!
0061122416|5.0|If you are in search of a wonderful story filled with wisdom for all ages, you can look no further. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho describes a young boy's journey to his dream. The story begins with the young shepherd in a old run down church with nothing but his sheep and his book. The boy, Santiago, has developed a re-occuring dream in which he envisions the Egyptian Pyramids. A gypsy informs him of a treasure that awaits him at the Pyramids and demands that he goes in search of it. He is first dismisses the idea but later encounters an old man. The old man convinces him to sell his sheep and buy a ticket for a boat ride to Africa. The young boy learns that all are endowed with their own personal legend. We all know it since childhood but few pursue it as adults. The treasure in the Pyramids is Santiago's personal legend. He faces some difficulty at achieving as he lands in Africa. His first encounter with whom he believes to be a friends is indeed a criminal. He is left in the local market place alone and lamenting the loss of his life's savings. Santiago the gets a job with a local crystal merchant. There he earns enough money to continue his personal legend. At first he thinks of returning home but then realizes home will always be there. Santiago continues in pursuit of his dream and is helped along the way with guidance of The alchemist and omens from the Soul of the world. I truly enjoyed this book and it has changed my views of reading in itself. It is an inspiring novel that teaches all of us to follow our desires. I would recommend this to anyone. I see it to be a book that can be read over different stages of life and give new meaning each time. Coelho shares so many life teachings in this book and one being the importance of a journey. One of my takes on the book was the belief that the journey is necessary to understand the destination. Also that it maybe equal if not more important than the destination. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life and the sooner the better. It will show you the importance of following your own personal legend and understanding that you must pursue it to achieve it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book!! It's a big cliffhanger though. I love the Roman and Greek mythology that's involved in this book.

B00079FUI6|5.0|Amazing cast.  Great writing. Perfect story lines. Missed the show so much since it went off the air and this has helped.
B0099114WO|5.0|Loved this movie, it was so funny. Our 38 year old daughter didn't find the humor that we did.  So maybe you need to be 50 to appreciate as much as we did.  Saw it at the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd. Would recommend to everyone over 50.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Sarah rehearses the role of a fairy-tale queen, performing for her stuffed animals. She is about to discover that the time has come to leave her childhood behind. In real life she has to baby-sit her brother and contend with parents who don't understand her at all. Her petulance leads her to call the goblins to take the baby away, but when they actually do, she realizes her responsibility to rescue him.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made. The characters, screenplay, and music are stunning. Day-Lewis is a mad genius.
0486290492|5.0|When two sisters appear to be deserted by the young men they had intended to marry, the stage is set for a delicious comedy of manners that not only showcases Austen's perception, humor and incomparable prose, but offers a splendid glimpse of upper and middle-class English society of the early 19th century.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|The reason I thought Avatar in 3D is so great is that the 3D enhanced the movie. It's as simple as that.<br />Too many 3D movies are intended to startle the viewer for no particular reason, other than to exaggerate violence, and to prevent you from realizing how mediocre or bad the movie is.
B004RBYJVO|5.0|After graduating from Emory University in Atlanta in 1992, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska, where he went to live in the wilderness. Four months later, he turned up dead. His diary, letters and two notes found at a remote campsite tell of his desperate effort to survive, apparently stranded by an injury and slowly starving.
0316228532|2.0|There were no likeable characters in this book.  I felt like Ms Rowling was trying a little too hard to prove she could write \\"serious\\" adult literature.  It was seriously depressing, and unentertaining as well. I would have moved away from this dreadful little town.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|The Lost City is a beautifully rendered puzzle game with an interesting story and good graphics.  The puzzles themselves are not too complicated; once a solution to a future/past puzzle is discovered, it isn't difficult to pair them together to continue on to the next screen(s).  There are an adequate number of map levels to explore, and there is a fair bit of backtracking involved to solve the game.  I enjoyed playing it.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|A little too much detail for my stomach on a couple occaisions. The end would be easier for pre-teens to handle in the movie version. Because of that I took my 12 year old to see the movie and did not insist he read the book first.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This was easily one of the greatest television shows to air ever, seriously, empty your cart and your schedule, buy this and watch both seasons back to back.

0743289692|5.0|If every American read this book, they would all see that the religion of Islam is a vicious, hateful religion that wishes to kill all people who are not Muslim. There is no negotiation with them to live together...it is covert or DIE. It also shows that the religion subjagates women to the point of slavery. Women have no rights...unless a man says she has. I admire Ayaan for her survival instincts and her ability to be logical and see the falicies in what Islam teaches. Islam was developed by Egyptian MEN who took the so called prophet's words and fit them into a religion to fit their desire to control the whole world.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Well, Nelson DeMille has done it again. This time an American, homegrown terrorist in Yemen.  This ought to be required reading for anyone who is interested in tourist travel to visit the birthplace of the Arab Empire.  Not!  I was transported to the sands of Yemen and taken along on a thrilling ride as DeMille's characters John Corey and his wife Kate hunt down The Panther.  Predators, Hellfire Missiles, corrupt government, Sheiks, Bedouins, and John Corey's wild sense of humor... it's all here.

B006VGGAC4|4.0|So much of the beginning is all about his shows in body and muscle training. Its interesting what they have to do to look like that, but I skimmed over alot. I am half way through the book, and yet to read when he and Maria got married. Of course it's a part of his life with his body and how he got started, but numerous names are mentioned, so that bored me too.

0800141849|5.0|This is not only a funny movie, but it has sever great actors in it, who are really great. Barbra, is such a good actor, herself. I don't think people realize that, because they only are aware of her musicals.

1401310672|5.0|I cannot wait to give this away for Christmas. I bought two of them and just browsing through them I was in tears laughing, My only word of caution would be that it is not for younger kids as many of the autocorrects end up being rather racy. I plan on giving them to my 21 year old neice and 20 year old nephew.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I've used this product all summer and am very pleased with it. I bought it so I could use my laptop as my navigation computer on my cabin cruiser. This GPS receiver lets me do that. I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to get a GPS location fix with their laptop/PC.

B000068QZK|5.0|In my opinion this is the best cd Ozzy has put out, it flat out rocks from beginning to  end. Here are some of the highlights, Miracle Man, Demon Alcohol, Fire in the Sky, Crazy Babies, Hero, Breaking all the Rules and more. The guitar playing is just simply awesome and Ozzy's voice sounds great. He hits the notes very well on these songs. I got this at a bargain price at Amazon.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|I was expecting this to allow me to run an HDMI cable from the side of my TV straight down so that I can wall mount it.<br /><br />The problem is this does not form a &#34;right angle&#34; with itself, it gets close, but it's not straight. So the cable instead of running straight down, runs 5-10 degrees out.<br /><br />This works fine for my TV, since the HDMI ports are far away from the edge (3-4 inches) and the bend of the cable prevents it from going past the boundary of the TV, but for others this might be an issue.<br /><br />Other than that minor gripe, 5 stars. I gave it 4 simply because of this one issue prevents it from being &#34;perfect&#34; aka 5-stars
B0000931QA|5.0|Queensryche reached its peak with this release. I have all of they're output, from the first LP to the most recent  which is called Dedicated to Chaos. They are not the band they were when this one came out. Thats unfortunate, but I guess they had they're run. There is not one song on this cd that I dislike and my favorite track is Spreading the Disease, just listen to the drumming on this one, its awesome. Other favorites are Eyes of a Stranger, The Needle never Lies, I don't Believe in Love, Revolution Calling, the whole cd just flat out rocks.
1401322786|5.0|I read the reviews from people who hated the book- just to see why they hated it. And yes the book is short and easy to read- I would think that would be a plus for a lot of people who don't like to read (although I myself am an avid book reader). And some people stated how he talked about the obvious- \\"time is important and precious\\". And I also agree with that. However, I would like to point out, even though time is important and precious- how many of us actually think about that?? Because it's easy enough to say that we KNOW it to be true...it's another thing to actually have it slap you in the face. I'm a harsh critic of books because I read often, and I found this book to be fantastic. I finished in under 2 hours (I'm also a quick reader), and I found myself tearing up at times thinking about my own life and thoughts at times. I read this book while sitting at the book store, and decided to buy it after I was finished. Why? Because I found this book to be the kind that I would re-read when I need to be reminded of important things...and it's one I'd like my family to read. Just because a book isn't \\"wordy\\" or \\"lengthy\\" doesn't mean it's not meaningful- and to me there is less of a reason for others to refuse to read it. Whether you think Mitch points out the obvious or not, sometimes the obvious NEEDS to be pointed out to people, because it's so obvious we forget to take it seriously. Buy it. Or borrow it. Whatever you choose- just read it. And let it sink in.
0385344333|5.0|The people who gave this book bad reviews, I don't think they were reading the same book as me.  This was one helluva ride!  This one was very suspenseful and I had a great time reading it.  If you like Jack Reacher, you will enjoy this one!

B000SEIDR0|2.0|I could not even finish the book. When the author began talking about how corn could not exist without humans I just had to give the book up. Clearly he is making assumptions with no facts to back it up.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I must admit I was skeptical at first, but when I began to play I fell in love. The game functions are easy to master, the visuals are cute and the gameplay engaging. Once you start I`m sure you won`t want to stop. easy to advance in the game as well.

030758836X|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Gillian Flynn. There's not too much that I can say about the book. It's definitely a book that needs to be experienced and I feel like revealing too much in the review would ruin it for people and I don't want to do that.<br /><br />Gone Girl deals with Nick and Amy Dunne. Mainly their marriage. On the day of theiir 5th wedding anniversary Amy goes missing. So what happened to her? Was she abducted from her and Nick's Missouri home? Did Nick have something to do with it? Is Amy even still alive?<br /><br />Flynn did a wonderful job of surprising me. I started out thinking / believing one thing and slowly Flynn would throw bits and pieces of information at me that would make me second guess where the story was going. Flynn did such a great job of this and it flowed so well with the story that it never just became a device. She threaded her plot together so tightly I was very impressed.<br /><br />Nick and Amy are both characters who have many different layers to them. I felt myself change my opinion on both characters numerous times before the end of the book. Flynn did a wonderful job exploring \\"double meanings\\" nothing was what it seemed, but it could be. Everything could be taken one of two (or more) ways. What you were seeing might be the truth or it may be a lie.<br /><br />At first, I would have liked the book to end differently, but, upon further thought, I think that the ending served the characters best. There were some things left unsaid in the end. Just one of those things that readers have to draw their own conclusions for.<br /><br />This is definitely the type of book that I will think about for days after I've finished it. Just thinking about the different twists and turns. I highley recommend this book, it was difficult to put down once I started reading.

Plastic with an extendable tip. Cool toy... toys are cool, but just a toy.

The entire underworld series has been filled with superior story telling, a truly talented cast, and epic directing.  Kate, please don't say no to another one.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was very funny. I totally recommend it. The teddy bear is hysterical. If you've ever lived in Boston, you will laugh a lot.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I've seen a LOT of movies in my lifetime.  so much now that I am seeing remakes of everything I grew up with.  Rehashes of the same theme/story, etc.  It's really hard to find something enjoyable anymore as everything looks pretty much the same.  This was a pleasant surprise that greatly exceeded my expectations.  Great story, great cast.  Loved it.
B002RXMG00|5.0|We downloaded this for free with our Prime account. It was easy to do and the movie was good. Very enjoyable.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|Jason Momoa was outstanding in Stargate Atlantis and he brings the same level of energy and athletic dedication to this movie.  Everything about it was epic.

B003VANOFY|2.0|Is it comfortable?  yes.  Will you have any issues using it strictly as a pair of headphones for music, games or movies? No.  Do the batteries last 8 hours as claimed?  No.  They last 3-4.  Pretty much everyone states this in the reviews.  Will you have endless trouble with voice chat?  OMFG YES!!!  One day it works fine, the next day you can't get it working at all.  Some days it sees the headset and other days it doesn't.  Some days the software works and some days it doesn't.  The volume control on the headset only works about half the time - if you are lucky.  They'd already had one major software patch for this when I bought it and I waited nearly a year and read lots of glowing reviews.  Apparently however, some people can't get this to work right no matter what.  You will either love it, or hate it.  I use a custom built power pc not a piece of wally world or dell junk.  *shrugs*
0800141806|5.0|Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together in one film displaying their acting talents in top form. Philadelphia is a great heart wrenching film everyone should embrace.
B005D81W5Q|3.0|First off, I love Cameron Diaz as an actress.  Most of what she's been in has been pretty good if not great.  There's nothing wrong with her acting here either.  It's the writing.  The story is diluted to show a minimum of outrageous stunts - most of them even turned to some sort of positive in this day of political correctness.  The highlights you see in the trailers are ALL you will see in the movie.  There really isn't that much bad behavior.  True to political correctness, the movie ends with her getting a soul, falling in love with the underdog, and changing her entire personality and outlook on life.  I wanted to puke.  Enough already with the political correct politics and moral messages in what is supposed to be a free expression of an art form.
B00683JK9K|2.0|Not a very good jigsaw app. Very simplistic and not challenging at all with very little variation.  Not one I would play very often.
B008602KQI|4.0|I don't understand why this is so wildly popular with the younger generation.  Don't get me wrong, the story is decent but it's all been done before.  I guess noone reads any longer.  you can find this similar theme of an oppressive future in dozens of stories.  I recall one that was nearly exactly the same only it was countries that sent &#34;contestants&#34; to the battlefield instead of districts and there were 50 of them instead of 24.  This is virtually a carbon copy retelling of that story. However, it was a good cast and a decent re-thinking of the theme.  I was however, displeased that so much of the backstory was left untold.  For instance, 12 districts instead of fifty states?  The districts appear to be fairly small, hardly encompassing even a fraction of the mass of the United States and then we only see one city.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat when Percy and naivety fell into tartous it was scarry
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its lots of fun but you have to have some patience it its going to.take a wile to finish unless you spend all your real money on the game
1781161313|5.0|I actually picked up the first edition of this back in the 90s and I'm overjoyed that this treasure has found it's way back into print. While it's \\"canonical\\" relationship to the \\"Alien\\" universe is subject to debate, it is an excellent and realistic (well, as realistic as you can get in science fiction) overview of those lovely little toys the Colonial Marines in the film from pulse rifles all the way up to the working of the Sulacco. It reads like an honest-to-goodness miltary field guide with various snippits of fiction thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />If you are an fan of Aliens, a military science fiction buff, a wargamer (this has book has been a great inspiration in my games of Stargrunt II and Tomorrow's Wars), you can't go wrong with this book in your library.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|THIS IS A CUTE MOVIE, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER FOLKS.  I BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOM (83) SHE ENJOYED IT, BUT WISHED THERE HAD BEEN MORE ACTUAL &#34;ROMANCE&#34; BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS.  IT ENDED TOO SOON!
B007KQI1NA|4.0|The GPS receiver is nice quality and works just fine.  But the bundled software does not work on my Windows 7, even though they write that it should work.  I've tested this GPS receiver using Google Earth and it does work fine.  Nice addition to road trips!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Among my 3D collection, this gets one of the top spots for true 3D effects. Eyes do not feel tired watch the entire movie. GREAT sound effects also. WORTH collecting. 2 thumbs up.
B00684J49U|5.0|really good.  nice. love it.  It is a  great pleasure doing business with you.  Please dont ever stop selling them.  I hope to buy more from you. Ill be looking out for your stuff.
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|In some ways this show does represent the current climate in the United States: Its equal combinations improbable, irrational, paranoid and crazy while depending on the shock value of the unpredictable to entertain. Preposterous is a good word to describe the show and its writing.<br /><br />In its second season, the show moves away from its initial mental illness theme (all fixed up by shock treatments) and turns into a rather preposterous love story. To make it work, they have to clear the decks of the entire extended plot of the previous season, characters and all. So goodbye Evil Vice President. Goodbye Abu Abu....I sure wish I knew what your master plan actually was. Goodbye little Vice President too.<br /><br />When the writers reach the plot's figurative \\"corner\\", the literally blow it up to allow them to start anew. Now the guity are innocent and we are sort-of replaying the fugitive while we track down the new terrorist hiding in the shadows who is 1000 times worst than good old Abu Abu.<br /><br />I think this thing has finally run its course. Running on shock value always ends with the plot running out of fuel. Thats where this is now.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|It would be hard to make a worse science fiction movie than Prometheus.  Despite it's \\"prequel\\" status, it has laughably little to do with the Alien/Weyland-Yutani universe -- those who love that universe will be painfully disappointed.  Worse, most of the \\"prequel\\" aspects make almost no sense.  The plot is amateurish, disjointed, and littered with science fiction cliches.  The characters actions are so senseless that even Academy Award-winning actors cannot make them believable.  The cinematography is typical Ridley Scott but even that cannot save this terrible movie.<br /><br />Steer clear -- very clear.
B000USU8ZY|5.0|Tis is a great movie, if you own the remake of it, it's a must to have the original to complete the collection.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|got it for a x-mas gift.price was right and sent it right out. so we haveit and now wrapped for x-mas. thanks
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|This is such a smart design.  Rode saw a need for a product and built the perfect solution for dslr film makers.
B003SJ4VJ6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The performances were good.  The filming was interesting enough for the genre. I was sufficiently amused.
B005I4JG80|4.0|This book was enjoyable to read, and informative at the same time.  I don't have kids yet, so it's yet to be determined if it will be helpful or not, but it was interesting.
1419705849|5.0|My daughters were VERY excited for this book....They love it...It is a great Christmas Gift....It was shipped with more than enough time to get it wrapped and under the tree
B000FC1K66|4.0|This book is Interesting holocaust story that moves very quickly.  Gives you lots to ponder.  Not as depressing as I expected.
B008I43DYU|5.0|this is a great app and helps me in math home work and it also makes problems easey in my every day needs.
B0024FADDI|5.0|Better to watch it with friends than alone, for this movie is crazy and awesome!! Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell make for the best team ever...Oh and don't forget Bruce Campbell's glorious delivery of his cult classic one-liners.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|I first heard Time Out back in the mid 60's, my brother brought it home when he was in the Navy he had it on reel to reel. It was love at first listen and it has been a part of my life since. This is an easy one, top selling jazz album of all time first million seller single but seriuosly if this isn't in every one's collection there is something wrong. This was such a rare recording when it first came not only was it made up of all orignal songs but they were in weird times than thete was the cover. It all seems mild today but back than it was different. But it seemed like different is what people were looking for. Dave speaks about driving through a college and hearing it coming out of every window. The list of songs looks like a greatest hit album not a bad song amoung them. But then I never heard a song by Dave I didn't like.But there is so much more to this release there is the live cd almost 60 minutes of the same group live. Included is a book cover the recording then on top of it all is the wonderful dvd with Dave talking about the songs on the record with Dave showing first hand on the piano he first wrote the songs on. Over all this is a wonderful release of one of the greatest records ever.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|The stylus okay.  I just didn't realize it was going to be so thick. I would rather draw with a stylus that's  a little thinner pen. However not sorry I made the purchase.
0345505387|2.0|Upon receiving my book, I took it out of the box expecting to enjoy reading it. Imagine my surprise when half way through the 1st. chapter the story line completely changed.  The first 2 chapters were a mess. Pages of chapter 2 were in chapter 1 & vice versa.  I had to shuffle thur the pages to put the storyline together.  Surfed some internet sites to find I am not the only one with a book like this & no hope of having it replaced.
B008RV5K4U|2.0|I didn't know this was a cartoon. Made me sorry I even got it. Not to worry though, I can find a kid that might want it.
B0084HGZKK|4.0|Excellent value and very interesting older recordings - some were milestones in their day. Generally very good sound. Good to get recordings of both Troilus and Cressida and The Bear.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Correct verbiage of description and image.  Everything that I needed and happy with product.  Will continue to buy from this consumer again.
B008F5FWJ6|5.0|A terrific compilation of his Decca recordings from the 40s onwards. Some of the sound  from 78s is rather  ordinary and the early mono LXTs don't always sound too hot ( too much treble emphasis). But no matter, the performances are exquisite.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love the game. its pretty easy to find the objects but takes forever to get the dimaonds to buy things.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I like this movie because it is a great action movie in the style of 300 and it's awesome to watch!
B009186JYI|4.0|This is a nice throw-back to the real Rolling Stones, before they became charicatures of themselves. Exiting to watch, except that the film seams very herky jerky much of the time, perhaps it was taken with a small hand held camera. Sometimes it's difficult to watch because of that.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|Great condition and price but the movie itself is not good.  They keep adding elements to expand the franchise and it is making things confusing.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Wow you have to be on your toes when you watch this film becuase it is very strange how they try to get into peoples minds. Didn't like this type of mive and couldn't watch it all.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Sad to see her go but what better way than to give the fans one last live show to remember her by!
B002XMGGK6|4.0|Good movie and kepted us interested. Action throughout. Jamie Foxx was great. Law enforcement is not always the place where you find honest cops. Go figure.
B00004RJ71|5.0|This is a great movie.  I am not Hispanic but I grew up in a Hispanic area and I could relate to most of the movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Interesting book and really enjoyed it but I am still not convinced that the experience is nothing more than the authors own perceptons.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I would highly recommend this series to anyone!  It is so addicting!  My boyfriend and I have watched 2 complete seasons in less than a week!!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Had to but this one hands down. I've always wanted Journey and when it game with mini games, 2 other full games, and soundtracks I just had to get it. Especially when the price was so cheap!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I would highly recommed this to anyone to purchase.  This show is just awesome!  Make sure you have lots of time because its highly addictive and youll want to keep watching!
1451695195|5.0|A very well written inspirational book about Dr. Alexander's near death experience.  Indeed a remarkable experience for both the author and the reader.  After reading it, I sent a copy to my two adult children.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My 3 year old plays with this all the time.  It has never broken...the tale fin/verticle stabilizer pops off often, but goes back on every time. If it didn't pop off, I'm sure it would have broken by now.  The tow cable in the back still works and hasn't been tangled beyond repair yet. I think I did have to put the tow hook back on once.  (or it's missing now, I'm not sure).  The wheels are still fine, and the wings are still fine.  I'm surprised it's held up this long.  Good purchase.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Well constructed...  I really lik ethe elastic snap back of the tab and the magnet that holds it to the side of the case.  It's a good case for the cost...  I Highly recommend it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I loved this series and getting it in Blu-ray at the great price makes me love it that much better.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Glad it ended on a good note and more of a story line in this 3rd book of the trilogy!
067144901X|5.0|An easy read for all ages and children really love this book.  I have purchased it many times as a baby shower gift instead of a card.
0547884591|5.0|I've read the 4hr body and went from ex-athlete turned take-out queen with ~20% body fat, to endurance athlete with ~8% body fat.  My life changed in hundreds of other ways, too.  I know the power of Tim's work and am currently reading the 4hr chef.  I've already bought three copies to give to my family and close friends for Christmas- this book is AMAZING!  I love to cook but I typically do so after a ten hour day at work so my time is limited but he teaches that you don't have to and how not to compromise on tasty, healthy goodness.<br /><br />This book is laugh-out-loud funny and inspiring.  It isn't just inspiring in an abstract, theoretical way but an approachable, results driven manner.  In my opinion, this is what Tim does that no one else has done better- he gives you a map, teaches you how to read it, helps you follow it and in my opinion, redefines failure as the act of doing nothing when he has made doing something, however small, so easy.  Now, if he could just write the 4hr relationship, I'd be set for life but I sense that this book will change my life in more rooms than in the kitchen.  After all, who can separate food and love?
0345803485|5.0|Received the book quickly. Really perked up the eroticism with my partner who was more than willing to try new thing.s
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Got this for a friend as a christmas gift. She loves Disney Moves and knew she would love this. Arrived earlier then expected and in perfect condition.
0316066524|5.0|The shipping was very quick and the service was great. Of course, this is a wonderful book by a fantastic author. I only hope my son hasn't already read it but by his response when I asked him, I think he has! It looks like I'll be reading it instead!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I have purchased all the soundtracks for each movie and though I am still partial to the first Twilight soundtrack, I am just as in love with this one! My absolute FAVORITE song on here is Christina Perri - A Thousand Years.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It takes forever to load a video. I think that there needs to be a youtube app made by Google for the kindle fire. Guts you need to fix this app. I'm on the kindle fire he if that's any help.

0062127241|3.0|I write as an avid Who fan who has enjoyed every minute of being a fan.  I got the new book, Who I Am, and read it as I traveled to the UK.  It took about three days of casual reading to get through.  From a stylistic standpoint, I expected more complex writing from someone who served as a copyright editor for a publisher, but Townshend sticks to a very basic, almost simple, writing style and word choices.  Others have written about how self-serving the book is, but I was really struck hard at just how self-absorbed Pete really is.  It is sad.  The book chronicals his stories of how he looked after himself at the expense of others, satisfied every urge he had (regardless of the moral weight or consequences) and how he is better, smarter and purer than anyone else around him.  It is striking.  He takes credit for quite a lot of innovation credited to other artists and muscians from Bowie to Marshall to Hendrix.  None of it can be verified, but it seems a bit far reaching.  He also starts early in the book building a case for why he later was arrested for the infamous child-porn charges.  It seems almost forced.<br /><br />I love the Who.  I love their music, almost all of which is Pete's.  Rock owes him a lot, and I have long looked up to him as a musician.  I am not sure if I dislike Pete as a person after reading the book, but I cannot say it drew me to him.  I was left feeling pity for this guy - not because of his struggles but that, in spite of them, he is left empty inside.  That is, if this book is accurate.  Who knows?

B004SKHJF2|1.0|I've tried everything to get this to work, and it did at one point. The LyricPlay feature, probably my favorite feature, doesn't work. The versions of this app from the Google Play store function fine with LyricPlay, but the Amazon version is somehow different and doesn't work.

B001AQR3MQ|5.0|What dreams may come, one of Robin William best ,  I'm not goint to talk about the acting ,with a cast like this you expect perfection or very close to it . I'd like to share something with you ,  I have 4 copies of this movie  , One on my moble  devices, a blu-ray  and 2 dvd's.After coming back for war I had  many problems and many stays in hospitals.  My heart has stopped11 times once they left me on the table  called to morgue  to pick me up  but i'm still here.  This movie to he comes the cloest to showing me the closest  to what heaven and hell are like.  not the streets paved in gold ,  this makes far more sence to me.  It is a amazing  film. overlooked by many, cherished by some , well worth a look..............to all my fellow vets... be safe and welcome  home

B000JMLFLW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Elizabeth is by far my favorite character. Her temperament is all that I inspire to be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such an epic book that will keep you on your toes and won't let you forget..... once you've started reading this book you won't be able to stop thinking about it
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is helpful to use on my kindle. It's nice to be able to see exactly how much battery life is available. I like how minutes are broken down depending on what you are using your device for.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I bought the most expensive thing in the game. After un equipping it It said I didn't own it. Halfbrivk needs to fix this.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This app only works when the nightstand mode is on and when I do use that mode it freezes up!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|it works fine<br /><br />it works fine<br />nothing is wrong with it<br />no one i am keeping it to watch later
0061703087|2.0|I love Michael Crichton books. I mean, who doesn't right? This book is not up to par at all compared to his other works. I felt like this book had an excellent premise and could have gone the distance. The beginning was very good and I thought it had promise. All of a sudden, when you get about half way through chapter two, you come to realize your error. This book is just cheesy. If I wanted to watch b flicks on the Syfy channel I would be doing that instead of reading a book. It is hard to believe this is out of the same mind that brought us such books as Jurassic Park and Congo. I might have to start reading the book previews before buying if this becomes a pattern. UGH.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I was originally looking for A Muppet Family Christmas but I passed based on the reviews. Then I stumbled upon this classic and I love it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Discovered The Piano Guys on YouTube about a year ago and have looked forward to and relished every new Piano Guys creation since then. Hard to describe the total Piano Guys experience: uniquely creative and passionate combination of pop tunes (that I would usually never listen to) with refreshing classical expertise enhanced with stunning video. What always comes through in their music is how much they enjoy what they are doing and that translates into how well they do it. They are also often very funny guys.<br /><br />So glad that Sony signed them and was so happy to buy this CD. The only thing wrong with this CD is that you can't SEE them play on it. Hope this is the first of many CDs!
B0053YGYO4|3.0|It certainly is not as good as the prior cd; not as innovative as i had hoped.  A lot of the tracks sound the same.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was a good story. I figured would check it out due to new movie coming out. It had an interesting plot and the main character was believable not in a Hollywood movie way. Essentially, estranged brothers. Jack ends up in a town by happenstance and becomes the fall guy for two murders that had happened. Ex army police, he uses his skills to try to point lead investigator to look at who actually might have killed the men. Then he comes to find out one of the dead men is his brother. The whole inquiry takes on deadly overtones when he starts looking into why his brother was there and it having to do with his job. Fast paced and unique plot with plenty of bad guys to go around. Will look at his other books.
1419705849|5.0|its a book for my daughter she is very happy . easy to ship that way it comes in a box and she still has now clue what it is.

B0018QOIXU|4.0|Love the Adele 21 and wanted to hear how she sounded before the fame of 21.  Her voice is great but the choice of songs is not as commercially selected as 21.  The production is good and the sound clarity is clear.  An interesting look at the vocal growth of Adele
B0072IUZUS|5.0|We purchased this as a gift and were amazed by the degree of detail in the molding, design, and coloration. Once again, Schleich does not fail to impress.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|The guy before me did a pretty good job so I'll just go from a purely emotional response.. this is FUN, Powerful, New Sounds, Retro Sounds.  Whenever I watch a QT movie, I feel like I'm watching a movie made by somebody who loves movies as much as I do.  They seem made by someone who didn't fall asleep at the wheel, someone who loves their job with a wink and a smile and a little snap, a little excitement, pep in the step .. all that .. whatever it is I just said.. carries onto this Soundtrack.  So I love it a lot and can't wait to see this movie.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|So many positive messages that can be gotten from this movie. Take care of mother earth, respect your fellow man, follow your heart, include your family, etc. LOVE it! !

B008KPDYQY|2.0|Thought this was the popular one with the line &#34;Help me I'm poor.&#34; It turns out that it was just a suggestion that automatically popped up when I typed in the movie that I really wanted. As I mentioned above, I didn't notice it wasn't the intended movie until I got it home and started watching it... I watched it since I bought it, more of a rent than buy type movie.
B000USU8W2|3.0|came in a great period of time.dvd cover was scratched and the dvd had a few too..don't know how it works yet, it's a christmas present.

B007VYQ9G2|5.0|I was expecting a cute story about Chimpanzees in their habitat.<br /><br />What I wasn't prepared for was the grand scale of the truly flawless visual presentation, not only of this vast and inaccessible habitat, but the close ups of the main characters themselves.<br /><br />There are several amazing and technically flawless segments involving time lapsed sequences of plants emerging and growing to demonstrate the passing of time.  Those segments alone are worth the film finding it's place in a nature lover's collection.<br /><br />I did read some of the reviews from those who were stunned by the graphic aspects of ape behavior depicted in this film.  These segments were flawlessly sequenced to demonstrate social order and tactics that demonstrate extraordinary ape survival tactics.  They did not overly glorify the killings, but rather presented it as a part of their collective survival or failure to do so.  The director did not avoid, nor celebrate the perceived violence of natural survival.<br /><br />As a photographer, nature and animal lover... I was absolutely thrilled with the quality of this natural adventure as presented in full blown panoramic clearer than clear blu-ray feature.<br /><br />The story line lifts you up, drops you to the very bottom and picks you up again for a grand finish... a collective master work in my nature loving opinion.<br /><br />THRILLED to own it and happily recommend it to those who want a dramatic visit to a part of the world most of us will never see.  The world's populations struggle over resources, as to these chimpanzees.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I love my Kindle and wanted something to help protect it but still be lightweight....love this...I like the white color and the fact I can brace this up for easier reading.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|very nice app for kindle fire!<br />I have been using it on my night table and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an elegant alternative to a traditional alarm clock.<br /><br />it would be nice to have additional alarm sound options and maybe some visual ones too.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie! It shipped fairly fast and it was in brand new, perfect condition. I love that it also has the Digital Copy. Hunger Games is PERFECT!
B006LSZECO|4.0|No spoilers, but I will say that if at first this book bores you, as it did me, stay with it because once it changes narrative, it becomes addictive! I'm glad I didn't give up on it, it became one of those books that I thought about for a day or two afterwards.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|I really like this movie! It shipped right away and I received it when I was told I would. This movie is really crazy and sometimes I ask myself \\"Did that really just happen?\\" But I received a brand new copy of this movie and it was in pretty good condition. I've already watched it and there were no problems as far as I am concerned.
B0031RS8NK|5.0|I highly recommend this book - it is an excellent and easy read. Its entertaining and funny. Perfect book for a holiday or vacation.
0525953728|5.0|Reading it now and its very interesting...I would recommend it to any one for that behind the scenes look that answers many unknowns...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|5 stars, it was a great read and it was pretty cheap. Definitely recommend it to people who like reading the genre.
B000002JK2|5.0|Had the &#34;album&#34; back in the late 70's..loved it then..love it now! I reccommend he cd to anyone who loves to rock!
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|There's a lot of talking in this movie, FYI. It's essentially the two characters having a conversation throughout the movie, so if that's not your thing, then you won't like this movie. Overall, I thought it was cute.
0061733199|5.0|Excellent survival skills book. A must- have for all who hike or camp in the wilderness. Also good for those who want to prepare for emergencies or difficult times ahead.
B000QE1U9K|3.0|This is my least favorite of the franchise. The whole thing takes place on a men's only prison planet. If any of you know the ending, then you'll know why it's my least favorite. Still, I really enjoy the Alien franchise!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Really didn't think that it would measure up to the first release. Blu ray, a 60\\" screen, and a pretty nice sound system made this one of my new favorites.Absolutely Loved it. Bring on Expendables 3.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This is a fun game to play when you're bored. They have classical songs (no real contemporary ones). The screen looks like a piano, and you must hit the keys as the rectangles are coming down.<br />Songs are of various lengths and difficulties.<br />I'd recommend it - it's fun, and good for kids.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The plot made sense (mostly).  The puzzles varied in difficulty, so all skills accommodated.  I look forward to Part 2.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Bought this for a friend and she just couldn't stop watching it. Took a whole weekend but she finished it.
B009ZE27US|4.0|this app is not as bad as everyone thinks, if you're mad because this app is inaccurate then your reviews are a waste of space and you should slap yourselves in the face for being so stupid
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Hey Amazon! It's Kill Bill.<br /><br />Two fantastic women slug it out in a trailer with a black mamba slithering around. Really. What's not to like here? What kind of rating do you want?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|gave it five stars its a great movie one the whole fam will enjoy very funny an sweet . I would recommend The lorax to anyone with kids or without :)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I LOVE MY OTHER GAMES BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS GAME I THOUGHT IT WAS STUPID THEN I GOT IT AND ITS LIKE SCRIBLENAUTS! THIS IS A REALLY GOOD GAME. I RECCOMMEND TO GET IT DO IT. THNK YOU
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think this game is amazing! the pets are really cute too. just a warning though,  only watch the introduction your FIRST time playing or else the whole game starts you over, I found that out the hard way.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Psycho follows Marion Crane when she steals $40,000 from her employer and ends up at the Bates Motel, where she encounters Norman Bates, the creepy manager. Psycho is a suspenseful and immersive film with many classic, unforgettable scenes.<br /><br />Psycho's story is easy to follow and very suspenseful; the ending throws an amazing twist at the audience with a haunting final image/monologue. The film really hooked me and was extremely immersive; the conversations between the characters are memorable and engaging, the murders are unforgettable (the shower scene is still one of the most iconic scenes in film history, in my opinion), and the music is thrilling and epic. The acting was great from the entire cast; however, Anthony Perkins is genuinely creepy as Norman Bates and is definitely the standout in Psycho.<br /><br />I own the Psycho (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]. The picture quality is amazing and makes Psycho look like a recently released film; the sound quality is also great. It has plenty of special features including theatrical trailers, the making of, and other goodies. This version only comes with a Blu-ray disc; no DVD or digital copy, and it does not come with a slip cover.<br /><br />Overall, Psycho is an extremely suspenseful horror film with great performances. I highly recommend purchasing and/or renting, especially if you can get your hands on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Psycho has some violence and blood. No sex or nudity.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Great sound - unmatched material.  Even the very early recordings jump out of the speakers with life, enthsiasm and take you back to a much simpler time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Federal crime records are devastating, even if you are completely ionnocent.  My professional career was devasted by the word of an ex-wife who made a false report.
B009K45Y62|5.0|While many people come down on different sides of the Nolan Trilogy, I for one love all three of them. The packaging for this version of the Bluray is a very nice plastic rendition of one of the teaser poster images.<br /><br />The discs themselves are filled to the rim with all sorts of extra features. Nolan is notorious for not doing deleted scenes because of the way he shoots and edits in advance. Very little is ever shot that he does not intend on using in the final cut. The picture and sound is incredible and the IMAX scenes really pop.<br /><br />A great investment for the Batman fan.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|I loved my wife Lana on this Album. She's amazing. She's a female Yeezy (Kanye West). The only problem is that I thought I would also have the songs from the Original album Born to Die on this CD but they only put the 5new songs on this disk. But still a dope album definitely buy it.
B005LAIHZY|1.0|When I received this movie package, inside of the frame has been broken, the 3 discs are fine, but I was not happy but willing to put up with it instead to return it.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|Great story of breaking the normal and how hard it is. Its one of those movies that makes you look at your life and how we complicate it. I'm planning on punching myself in the face when my boss tries to fire me and then claiming he tried to rape me too.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is cute and fun and the vocals are great. But it feels underdeveloped. The relationship between Anna Kendrick's character (Becca) and her dad doesn't seem to have any role in the film. Neither does the arrest.<br /><br />I wish they hadn't shown the full performances of the guys (Treble Makers) during the competitions- A short cut would have been better so we could focus and be more invested in the Bellas.<br /><br />Parts of this movie are really, really good. I laughed out loud at parts. Some I wanted to fast forward. Some, I wanted to ask questions- why are you doing that? Why does this matter?<br /><br />I was also disappointed that a full-length version of \\"No Diggity\\" wasn't included on the sound track. It is clearly the best song in the movie and is being used in all of the promos. It should have been recorded. I'd buy that in a heartbeat! But the riff-off version is jumbled, and I don't care much for the other songs.<br /><br />Alot of what Becca does is not really clear. Her motivations aren't clear. Why did she join the Bellas? We don't see that initial connection so it doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Also, why is the leader of the Bellas the leader? Why can't she be overthrown? I didn't follow why there wasn't any kind of anarchy.<br /><br />I think this movie COULD have been SO MUCH MORE amazing that it was. I fully anticipated buying it before I rented it, but now that I've rented it... Eh. I really liked it, and I'll watch it again, but it's not a movie you can be totally invested in the storyline. It is better to watch once, and then leave it on in the background while you are doing other stuff. It's a good showcase for the vocal performances, but the story needed more work. They could have done better.<br /><br />Fat Amy is awesome.
1250010403|5.0|really like the book and am waiting for the third one.He is such a good writer and makes you not want to get to the end
B009ZE27US|1.0|so dumb..... it kept saying I was 48 and I amy about I am about 40 years younger than that. it nerved got the right answers. boooooooooooo age scanner
B005ONTD42|5.0|Its not a toy but it is huge fun. Its not a robot but it does smart robotic things. Its a ball but it does much more than roll around... or will do.<br />With the addition of their own small but growing app collection this has gone from being an impressive novelty to a work of genius, with potential for radical new uses.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is so fun and cute great for kids and adults you won't regret geting this app very fun!!!!!!!!!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great price for one of the best movie franchises.  Am such a big fan!  This should be a must for every film lover.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I've use a spyder2 express and a spyder3 pro for years.  Hands down, without doubt, the colormunki is a better product.  Also, it truly helps set the brightness.  The spyder3 really doesn't.
B009ZE27US|1.0|it said I was 42 then 19 then 24 and 19 so it is horrible never download you will regret it I'm telling you the truth
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I took my pre-teen cousin to see this movie and we both loved it! Had adult humor and kid humor. I would be a little leery of taking small children to see it as it gets a little dark and has some content that might not be appropriate. But overally I found it very funny and greatly enjoyed this movie.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|What can be said about a try classic. Read it again and against I do every holiday season. Enjoy and Happy  Holidays
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Should do very well on American radio :-(  Wow, Aerosmith and this new album should do awesome at the American Grammy's because all that ever gets broadcasted anymore is a bunch of crap. Typical American bubble gum and another disappointment from an iconic band overwelmed with talent. Want good classic rock??? Check out the new album called \\"Monster\\" by KISS.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had heard so many people talk about Jillian's DVDs. When I saw this on Amazon for such a good price I figured I'd jump in and get it. Boy did I underestimate it! Jillian's workouts will have you sweating and really working 5 minutes in. I recommend this to anyone who loves workout DVDs.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I'm never disappointed with Cornwell's Scarpetta books. I wish she could write them a bit faster! Just a really good read.
B005F96URI|5.0|If you don't take things too seriously, and you love action and cool effects and lighting... This is a perfect movie. I loved the storyline and the characters and just everything and I was glad to add this to my collection. Plus Gackt is in it. Hello. Come on.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I've been looking for an app that would give me a continuous stream of relaxing music for a while, and this one is the best. You can play multiple sounds at once and adjust the volume of each one (but only right when you start playing it. You have to stop it and start it again if you want to change it. Kinda annoying, but still pretty simple). I like the sounds too, and it's got a nice selection for a free version. I'm not quite sure what the meditation sounds are for since you can't hear them, but oh well. It might freeze up if your kindle is slow or low on memory, though.
1401322786|5.0|This book is amazing! Mitch Albom is an awesome author and his books just keep getting better! Worth the price!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even better than the movie was. I couldn't stop reading!!!!! I definitely can't wait to start reading the second book.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It has every word you can pretty much think of. It is great for school. When I look the words up for school it makes it easier
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This is just a quick note to anyone considering buying an extended L-bracket for the 7D like those sold by Really Right Stuff or Kirk Photographic. I purchased a less expensive battery grip for my 7D which worked fine. It loaded the batteries, however, from the left side of the grip (when viewed from the back). This meant every time I needed to swap out batteries, I had to remove the L-bracket which required an Allen wrench and risked stripping the Allen bolt.<br /><br />The Canon battery grip loads from the back of the grip meaning it does not interfere with the extended L-bracket. I can leave it on the camera all the time. I shoulda' done a little bit more research. This issue does not affect anyone not planning on using an extended L-bracket. Now it's off to eBay to sell the other grip!
1400049628|5.0|This book is hilarious and eye-opening at the same time.  It has a permanent spot on my bookshelf!<br />Have you ever wondered what you should do if and when the zombie apocalypse occurs?  What is the best transportation?  What about weapons?  Well, I have asked myself these things many times, and this book has finally given me the answers!  I can sleep better at night knowing I have a viable escape and survival plan for when the inevitable happens.<br />Knowing the enemy is half the battle, and Max Brooks does a fantastic job of describing our future enemy - the zombie - from the first recorded instance of a solanum outbreak to today.  He rounds out the book with a detailing the ins and outs of zombie physiology and psychology (or lack thereof).  Every chapter is delivered with a heavy dose of wit, making the book both informative and fun to read over and over.<br />I am now properly prepared to save myself and my family when Z-Day hits, completely thanks to this essential guide.
B005LAIH54|5.0|To be honest, I was not expecting much given the many lukewarm reviews but the lush visuals and amazing actions sequences more then make up for this films weaknesses. If only the chemistry and character development between Perseus and Andromeda had been developed somewhat it would have really soared. Despite the flaws, if you have any interest in ancient mythology it's always fun to see how top notch special effects wizards bring these myths to life. In that regard, it was a joy to see a family of raging yet reasonable cyclops, Pegasus in action, Pegasus with a personality and a great cameo shot of Ray Harryhausen's wonderful mechanical owl Bubo, sweet. The labyrinth scene was awesome and of course if you have a maze you are going to get a Minotaur. I thought for a minute we might get to see Theseus show up and lend Perseus a hand but that didn't happen. If they make another one in this series in the future - maybe they can do some special effects magic to bring back Steve Reeve's Hercules for a cameo too. Again, despite all the mixing of myths and flat acting on the part of some characters, the movie was a blast to watch and Cronus was indeed one scary dad.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was really surprised at the quality of this camera bag given the price. I was looking for a small-ish bag that I could use while hiking and this seemed to be a decent choice, especially since I've been pretty happy with other Amazon Basic products.<br /><br />The build quality is excellent, with strong seams and zippers that work well. The fabric is more than durable enough to withstand a good amount of abuse. The internal padding is nicely done, and I'm especially pleased with the padding on the straps - very comfortable to wear this for an extended amount of time.<br /><br />The storage space is more than ample. This usually gets used with my smaller SLRs, but I can fit my Canon 5D Mark II and a few prime lens into this without difficulty. Lots of cubbies to hold all the sundries (cables, battery packs, filters, etc.).<br /><br />It's not perfect, especially with regard to the tripod straps. I would like those to have been more robust for carrying a heavy tripod. But, for the price, I won't deduct any points for that.<br /><br />I have bags that cost far more than this, but don't perform any better. Highly recommend, and a great value.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It has some real life elements to it. It definitly introduced me to some new concepts. But mostly I liked it because it read like my diary. I wasn't reading about Anastasia, I was reading about me. I couldn't put it down, but not because of the intelectual factor but because I'm a girl and I like reading about feelings. In a way, it's like a soap opera... rediculous situations but girls just eat them up. I wanted to know more and more, but when I got to the end, I had no interest in going further and following the next book. This ending was good for me.
B00000IM2R|3.0|No question, the content of the songs and performances on this LP is 5 star.  It is a blues classic!  But if one is going to spend this kind of money on a supposedly audiophile vinyl reissue, then isn't the real issue how it sounds??  The CD release of King of the Blues Guitar was released in 1986 at the beginning of the CD era.  Most CDs of that vintage are now considered passe and inferior to all the \\"remastered reissues.\\"  Well, not true here.  While it is mastered at a low volume and you have to actually USE your amplifier, it has all the cuts on this album PLUS 7 or 8 more.  But the sound is considerably better than this \\"audiophile\\" vinyl release.  I know because I own both of them.  The bass is more audible, the mids and highs are cleaner.  It's just the truth.  So, don't be fooled by \\"audiophile\\" pressing or the high price tag.  The old CD \\"King of the Blues\\" sounds much better.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't already been said?  This series was beautiful, heartbreaking, exciting.  And ended for no good reason, much too soon.  You are missed, Rome, you are missed.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, watch it.  If you have seen it... well then you already know how I feel, don't you?
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|That essentially describes it, but it's a silly little game similar to farm ville. I do miss the mid eighties version, though!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|It's small and thin,  but prone to break easily.<br />It is however Cheep. And honestly it looks VERY stylish.<br />If you want safety and options,go with the &#34;elago&#34; one which is almost 3 times as much. but has features like ejection, and a blue blinky light that shows when it's accessing data.

0316069434|4.0|Veteran LAPD detective Harry Bosch, the leading character of the author for over twenty years, if nothing else, is persistent when confronted with a case that gets in his gut. The chaos of the LA riots in 1992 and the lack of forensic capability permitted only a cursory treatment of the murder of blonde Danish war correspondent Anneke Jesperson, found in an alley off of Crenshaw Blvd in Los Angeles. But Harry, now working under the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP), is back on the case as a member of the Open-Unsolved Unit. The chief wants the unsolved murders during the riots investigated and closed, or so he says.<br /><br />The differences between then and now are, one, advanced techniques to trace the use of shell casings, and, two, time for Harry to relentlessly pursue the question of why Anneke was in LA. Harry begins to make progress on the gun, tracking it through San Quentin prison and the gangs of LA, but his lieutenant suddenly tries to reassign him. Harry has been down this road numerous times: conflicts with his supervisors revolving around political correctness. The chief does not want the case of a white woman solved, when most of the deaths were of black folk. Just to make sure Harry gets the message, he is faced with an IA investigation based on bogus charges.<br /><br />The author permits some of the endearing side of the irascible Harry to come through: his love of jazz and teenage daughter Maddie, his contentment sitting on his back deck looking at the coyote trails drinking a Fat Tire beer, and his appeal to women, this time Hannah Stone, a psychologist. However, for Harry, it is always about his current case. He covers a lot of ground in this fast-paced mystery, including probing the connection of the Gulf War of 1991 to Anneke's murder. It is always fun to watch Harry relentlessly pursue the bad guys, deflecting flak that would stop merely normal detectives.

B003IEJZUG|5.0|Illustrated edition was very cool if you read the book without the movie book companion. Recommend reading after High School to comprehend full meaning of the book. Excellent writing by the author. Can't imagine many people that would not like this book if they are interested in adventure

B0041KVYIW|5.0|Maybe I was lucky but my copies of the 2012 re-issued Beatles albums are all perfect. I pre-ordered four of this set and recieved them in Australia 1 week after the release date - nice work Amazon. Not only that all of the albums were in A1 condition from the covers to the vinyl itself. The individual albums I ordered were Rubber Soul, Revolver, The Beatles (The White Album), and the now withdrawn from sale on Amazon (18/12/12) Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club and all of them are immaculate. It is a shame their are many people experiencing problems with these re-releases because if you get a good one they are fantastic. These re-issues were probably the most anticipated set of re-releases in the new vinyl era and it does refect very badly on quality control within the current vinyl pressing industry that so many seem to be flawed. Having collected vinyl for over 40 years it is maddening that modern record production seems to be a hit and miss affair. Some finesse has definately been lost in production and despite the debatable claims that 180 gram vinyl sounds better a lot of new albums seem to have inherent flaws such as pops, residual vinyl on the disk, background noise, or very rough edges on the record itself. All of these problems make for very wary record buyers and they are all quality control issues. Traditionally, in my experience, a bad pressing was a rarity but unfortunately these days it seems much more common. Hopefully the issues with these Beatles releases will give the current industry a much needed wake up call and put pressure on them to get it right in the future because when it works vinyl is the best.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first book review I have ever written and it is more of a plea than a review.  I finished Wool 1-5 as well as First Shift and Second Shift last week and I cannot stop thinking about the whole series. They may be the best books I have ever read--certainly they have had an effect on me and I cannot stop thinking about the third installment.  Hugh Howey is brilliant.  At first I wasn't sure that introducing so many characters in the first books would work--I mean--you get attached and then they are gone.  But, now I see how critical it is to the whole universe of Wool because the different perspectives and experiences of the characters just makes it all so much stronger and real.  Now that I have finished, I can't stop thinking about silos or nanotechnology and how seemingly intelligent (or not) ideas just go to hell and, in this case, contributed to the destruction of the world as we knew it.  Howey raises some great questions about the nature of humans, politics, power, rebellion...why do they clean? and so much more.  I love the idea that the entire series is going to come together and in the end I think we are going to see a final showdown between the people who created the world underground and those who have lived in that world for centuries.  The creators will have to full on face what they did and I am sure (especially Donald) is not ready for that. Who knows how this finale will play out, but I can barely wait to read it.  Thank you Hugh Howey for writing these books and planting a fantastic story into my brain that might be there forever.  Please hurry with Shift 3!
B00846REIS|2.0|Could they have copied the plot almost exactly of 50 Shades anymore? Wasn't even tempted to read another book in the series

B00828I5A4|5.0|UPDATE:<br />I just realized that this review was posted on the item for the the entire DVD (not just the one for that particular episode). So do not read on if you are not caught up to the last episode of season 5.<br /><br />----<br /><br />This is a review of the last episode of season five, \\"The Countdown Reflection.\\"<br /><br />I thought this episode was very funny, and quite possibly the best one yet. Without giving anything away, this episode puts Howard's NASA aspirations in conflict with his upcoming wedding to Bernadette. Mixed in with the funny moments, there are also some very touching moments that should truly make you feel like you are there with the characters (assuming you have been watching the series consecutively up to this point).<br /><br />This was a great ending to season five, and I highly recommend watching this episode (as well as the rest of this season).

0061692042|5.0|This is quite different from the Bascombe trilogy in story and style. While it is a coming of age story the bit about how all of these events influenced the life of the man is not really part of the book. This is more about how a young boy tries to understand the events of the world that are way beyond his control and which he is only privy to snippets of. While I really liked the Bascombe trilogy (and have read it twice) I would probably put this as his best work.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This was my favorite album of 1974 and has stood the test of time and to this day is still one of my favorite headphone albums of all time.<br /><br />This is early blues/rock done the way it should be done. The style is all Trower, nobody can copy his style. Yes the Hendrix influences are there but taken to a distinct higher level of perfection.<br /><br />When Trower was at his peak he was still truly unknown and that is a shame. It has taken a while but he has had his status elevated over the years to his now status as one of the truly great guitarists of our time. His great contribution in his early years when he played with Procul Harum also went unnoticed.<br /><br />\\"On Bridge of Sighs he shows off his skill to the maximum and this album is rightly regarded as his finest moment. \\"Day of the Eagle\\" sets off the album as it means to go on, but in the title track, Trower really shows off his virtuosity with a blues number, replete with looping guitar work that is hard to find in anyone else's repertoire. Right the way through it carries on with some excellent extended guitar solos, tight drumming and innovative bass.\\"<br /><br />Personnel<br /><br />Robin Trower...guitar<br />James Dewar...bass, vocals<br />Reg Isidore...drums<br /><br />\\"Robin is much more than a guitar player. He has written, and continues to write, some of the most unforgettable lyrics and musical compositions the Rock, Ballad and Blues genres have to offer for more than 40 years now.\\"<br /><br />I strongly recommend this album as one of the best of all time. I also recommend Robin Trower - Living Out of Time: Live (2005)Concert DVD, see my other review.<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Robin Trower's \\"Bridge of Sighs\\"(full album)on You Tube.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love it! It helps so much at the holidays especially with having five children! I plan on using it alot!
0385536828|5.0|I am a McEwan fan and have read most, if not all of his books. Did not like Saturday, Solar or On Chesil Beach very much and wondered if he was on a downward path. I rate Atonement, The Innocent, Enduring Love and Black Dogs very highly in about that order. Some of the themes in Sweet Tooth are similar to The Innocent. The last chapter could have been left out in my opinion.
B00A757EFW|1.0|the controls are not responsive at all, very frustrating. they should also let the pac man continue on a path if there is no intersection
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Although there are times where the graphics aren't so sharp, there are quite a few gimmicky 3D scenes which we really enjoy! WE enjoy the storyline and imagery of this DVD as well! You'll enjoy it!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This series is A+ movie quality. Story sucks you in and gets you loving the characters. Get season 1 and enjoy a zombie fest!
